You are right about the platform they provide but are not taking into account the other business model not related to the platform.  For example, Governments, cities, municipalities, political parties  (among others) who have no immediate use for the platform and use the data for research purposes.  Big business is interested in trends of certain demographics, etc.. and then buy the data to market to people in traditional methods also.   There is a huge market for the information that FAcebook has on its users that corporations and governments acquire for research purposes.  It is a a bit naive to not to take into account the other way for Facebook to make money.  In the Terms of service and privacy policy of facebook they have a specific backdoor in it just for the purposes I mentioned.   They sell your data off the platform as well.   Many big companies sell data to third parties just because it is a way to make extra cash on the side.

I never said it was impossible.  I simply stated that it was a stretch to assume that the old money was acquired through slave labor just because the man was a southerner, given that 75% of families did not own slaves.  Plus,  there have been 4+generations since involuntarily servitude was abolished in the USA.   That’s a long time and could easily have been built after slavery according to your definition.   It’s stupid to make some claim that his family wealth made their money through slave labor just because someone is from the south.   You defended the guys absurd claim.

I do think they are intentionally wrong. Whether people like President Trump or not, the MSM in the USA has been trying whatever they can to get him removed from office.  They publish fake news all of the time, including Fox, to see what they can get away with.   Fox is owned by the Murdoch boys and they are not Trump supporters either (liberal).   The heads of the 6 power companies who own all of the American media and entertainment entities dislike Trump passionately.  There is a huge false assumption that there is any independent American main stream media. (Only 6 corps control all ways in which Americans get their information).   This will blow your mind.
 They are all controlled by 6 power corporations who own ALL of the entertainment, TV networks, film, sports, and media outlets.  So anti-Trump propaganda is out in full swing if all 6 heads hate Trump.  The CEO of CNN was Jeff Zucker.  Prior to Trump running for office Zucker hated him and still does. 
 Harvard did a study showing how biased American media is against Trump which I linked earlier.  With their bias against him coupled with fake news so often, its incredible that he was able to win despite all of the chips stacked against him.   The companies that own the American pollsters were also rigging polls during the election (severe oversampling), telling everyone that Hillary would win in a landslide.  
American main stream media is not free and independent.  That's why small alternative media has really become popular over the last 5 years. People are waking up to the propaganda.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:29:21
75% of southern families did not own slaves according to the 1860 census.  So I think it's a reach to just assume that it's from plantation slave earned money .  Also, how the hell do you know what this guy did to become a billionaire or his family?

How about all of those polls showing Trump was going to lose in a landslide?  Either people didn't tell the truth or the media lied or both.    A new Harvard study done in May shows that a majority of Americans think that the MSM publishes fake news. 
CNN, ABC, NBC and MSNBC all had had to retract fake news and suspend people recently.    I think the American people across the board have never been less "informed".  Odd that Fox hasn't been publishing fake news and isn't on the list.

I don't think the 1% was bullish on crypto when the Winklevii got in.  Most were still calling it a ponzi scheme etc...   It was the twins' exposure to the tech startup entrepreneurs that propelled them into crypto.  These guys were also ahead of the curve in social networks.  Most of the dinosaur 1%ers were not in this space either.   I don't think their background gave them any advantage over others except getting some help financially from their wealthy father.  These two guys just come up with good ideas and make sound business moves.  That is what good entrepreneurs do, no matter how "educated" they are or wealthy their upbringing.

The Harvard study mentioned in the article below contradicts what you're stating.
"The study found that in Trump's first 100 days in office, the tone of the news coverage of the president has been a whopping 80 percent negative to 20 percent positive.
CNN and NBC struck a 93 percent negative tone on their Trump stories, with only 7 percent positive. CBS was third in the anti-Trump race, with a 91 to 9 ratio. And the pro-Trump Fox News? That network was 52 percent negative to 48 percent positive."

Bleeding hearts throwing out blanket statements like “free healthcare for everyone” does not address the problem.  I am a US military vet and the VA is a total joke. I am supposed to get basically “free” healthcare for life and I almost always have to spend money out of pocket outside the VA because the government system is so unbelievably incompetent.  
Yes, we can do better.  However, I am extremely skeptical that having the US government in total control of healthcare is going to help fix things.  There has to be a way to create a government-backed health safety net while also privatizing it in some way that works.  Obamacare and the VA is a total failure right now.  Something must be done ASAP.

What you are suggesting will definitely be government run health care.  I think you need to think this one through a bit more.   Gov has the power of the purse for what gets funded in healthcare under the system you suggest. That’s the ultimate control.

There will not be a peaceful transition to communism.   To keep a society communist a central authority must enforce the rules.  (You have to prevent people from trying to trade goods for profits). You also have the issue of the central authority who polices the society never wanting to relinquish their powers to “abolish the state”.  So you get another USSR and North Korea, and eventually a China when planned economies prove to be awful for a society.

That it is Google's duty to censor for the good of mankind.

The whites who get tribal will leave the USA and move to Eastern Europe.  Then China will laugh as the USA collapses like Rome from internal conflicts.

No,  actually it is being met with fierce resistance and that is why Italy,  Poland,  Hungary, Austria, Czech, Slovenia, Japan etc... is saying no to multiculturalism.  It’s why anti immigrant parties are gaining steam all over Europe, including AFD in Germany and Swedish Democrats in Sweden.   I guess you are too busy sipping tea to realize what is going on around you? Brits votes to Brexit.  That vote kind of contradicts your globalist loving narrative.
Many Europeans do not believe that Islam is compatible with the West.   I suppose Europeans will not tolerate it much longer.  For this reason civil wars will probably break out in the next twenty years.  I believe the Europeans will band together to fight for the survival of their cultural heritage.

Better to make payments. He will have no problem getting out of debt when his BTC appreciates higher than it is now in 10 years.  Why would he sell all his BTC now?  He took out college loans before he knew about BTC and was mentally prepared to work to pay them off later.  Why would he sell all his BTC now to pay them off and then not hold BTC when it could potentially be much higher than it is today 10 years from now?  Why not use his BTC to make payments on the loan and continue holding as adoption increases.  Use your BRAIN!  HIs upside is greater to HODL than the downside risk.   If he's already sitting on nice gains, why not continue the ride and slowly chip away at his loan instead of getting rid of all of his BTC?  It sounds stupid to do otherwise.

You are right.  You can't incite violence. However, Free speech is about being able to express political opinions.  You can no longer do that in Europe.  If you say something against Islamic immigration on social media you can be imprisoned. This happened in UK recently.  Germany has been cracking down on what they call "hate speech" in their country.   For the government to be able to simply make up on a whim what it deems to be "hate speech" should scare the crap out of folks.  You can't do that in the USA.  I can say whatever I want, as long as I don't threaten violence or incite actions that would harm others.  There's a huge difference between the 1st amendment in the USA and the rest of the world.   
For example, here is a hate speech law in the Uk.
The law criminalises “using [a] public electronic communications network in order to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety,” and can result in a six-month prison term or fine of up to £5,000.

No shit, a lot can change.  I get that.  You realize he was already mentally prepared to work to pay off his loans even without owning any BTC?  Is he not sitting on enough BTC to get rich and not have to be a wage slave if BTC really moons 10 years from now?  Why blow that once in a lifetime opportunity just to say that he paid off his student loans early?  What's next for him without BTC?  Back to the workforce to work like everyone else as a wage slave until retirement?  BTC's success can give him opportunities that most can only dream of.  This is such a terrible idea.  He should pay off the student loan debt as the monthly payments come up and continue holding the rest of his BTC.

Obama had a stagnant GDP his entire time in office,  like no growth.  Trump is growing the gdp after year 1 and they are having to recalculate the projections because they have underestimated the explosive growth.  Obama had the worst labor participation rate since the Great Depression.  Way better under Trump.  Obama’s economy was a disaster.  He destroyed the healthcare market and bogged down the economy with useless regulations.  America will be the largest oil exporter in the world by the end of 2018.  The middle class was getting crushed under Obama in middle America.  That’s why Trump won.  Trump was talking about fixing this issue instead of worrying about where trannies would use the toilet.  
Cheating on his wife?  Bill Clinton was banging hookers left and right while he was President, including getting head in the White House by his intern and then lied under oath to Congress.  Nothing happened. You think anything is going to happen with a Republican controlled Congress?  It won’t.  Nothing will come of this as usual,  just like the fake Russia hacked the election BS and the “collusion” narrative.

The dude single handedly destroyed the American health care system also.  You want to dive into that as well? It was such a success that premiums were up across the board, some states over 100%.  Drugs costs skyrocketed as well.  Well as long as illegal aliens have healthcare for free while the rest of us have to pay unaffordable premiums.  I forgot to mention that we were denied our ability to keep our doctors who we trusted and our plans.  Thanks Barry!  
Obama’s economy was so bad that Trump was elected to fix it.   Can you imagine that?  
As of year 1 the economy under Trump is booming.  There is no denying that.  You are living in fantasy land about Obama but he was a terrible President.  Bill Clinton blew Obama out of the water as POTUS.

There's another body in there, genius.  Who are you to say that an unborn human body has no rights just because of your beliefs? Who are you to say it is morally justified to kill an unborn baby?  How about using a  condom or birth control? You can't play with fire and then complain if you get burned. That's your choice. We have so many ways in which you can prevent a pregnancy today. Aside from rape, incest, or direct threat to a mother's life, the entire abortion problem can be stopped if people just used protection. It's what, 99% effective? 
 It's like brushing your teeth. You brush them so that you don't get cavities. You wear protection or take pills if you don't want a pregnancy. But no, our sick society encourages reckless behavior and then makes excuses for you when you knowingly put yourself in that situation to begin with. That fetus has a right to life, since it is the actions of both the MOM and DAD that enabled it to exist in the first place. Did that baby magically seek refuge in the womb of his mother against her will? NO. The mother's choice (free-will) not to use protection is the reason the baby is growing in her womb. The baby therefore should not be held accountable and sentenced to death for the reckless action of its mother. For any government to recognize as legal a death sentence for an innocent life form occupying his mother's womb solely based on the free will of its mother is highly immoral.  
 
Don't want to give birth to a baby?  Great, use protection.  But leave the unborn babies the fuck alone.

 Jeff Sessions has been elected into office as a US Senator for decades.  Not sure what you mean that he wouldn't have made it into office by vote.  Sessions is not referring to Bitcoin in general being a big problem.  The author of this article took his quote out of context.  He is referring to the Dark Web markets and how Democrat Diane Feinstein and him want to crack down on Dark Web bitcoin users.  Is this surprising at all?   The previous Attorney General was doing the same thing.  This is par for the course no matter who is in office.

Nice slippery slope fallacy.  You didn't even address my point.  
Good luck hoping that people switch to Communist Coin.  It won't happen and you'll be left holding the bag.  However, some governments are trying to adopt their own crypto currencies and that might have a more "fair" distribution.  (what does "fair" even mean?)  But that will not impact BTC price.  BTC is digital version of gold and will be a solid store of value at a multi trillion market cap.  Perhaps govs will back their state digital currencies with BTC.  The point is that whether BTC is ever used as a currency is irrelevant.   Nobody uses Gold as a currency anymore, but it still has a 7 trillion marketcap.

Is it the same risk to invest 100 dollars when BTC is 1 dollar versus someone investing 100,000 dollars when BTC first hit 1000 dollars back in 2013? What if someone invested 100k when BTC was only 1 dollar.  Now that would have been super risky back then.   You are the one talking about luck, not me.

Either way, crypto isn't going to be banned in the USA.  What on earth would give you the reason to suggest this?

The Chinese have been infiltrating our systems for a long time.  We do it too.  That's part of the game.   But to think that the Russians somehow influenced the masses to vote for Trump is beyond ridiculous.  Trump won the rust belt states because his message resonated there and he outcampaigned her there.
Seth Rich leaked the DNC emails and Hillary was a terrible candidate.  She lost because people rejected her platform, not because Russia or some other boogeyman bought facebook ads for 100 grand.  
The Russian investigation is a complete hoax and nothing will be found.  I want to know why Hillary and Podesta were colluding with the Russians?   She sold off US uranium in pay to play scheme with her foundation.  Podesta owning shares in Kremlin backed entities. Podesta saying in Wikileaks dump  that they need to figure out how to somehow tie Russia to Trump.  Also, Clinton colluding with Ukraine against Trump during the election?  Did you read into that as well?  
DNC is a highly corrupt organization in American politics (proven in wikileaks email dump).   Main stream Media outlets were also caught colluding with DNC and Clinton campaign.  Never in my life have I seen a more biased, propaganda-peddling media machine.

Russia is fake news.  How about those facebook ads by the Russians supporting Hillary?  lol  How about John Podesta stating in wikileaks emals that we need to somehow tie Trump to Russia?    They haven't found a damn thing and they won't.   This was fake news to try to find an excuse for why Hillary lost.
What a delusional moron you have to be to trust the fake polls?  The same polls that have Hillary winning in a landslide?  With huge dem oversampling?  Read the fucking leaked DNC emails.
You idiots don't want to read them because it blows up your fake reality.

Good luck with Communist Coin.  LOL

The problem with the bubble is that its creating more people who are "educated" with useless degrees.  Gender studies,  religious studies, Lgbt, art history, exercise science,  etc....
These morons take out loans to get degrees in absolute garbage  fields and then complain that they can't find work.   Colleges love it and encourage these idiots to take out huge loans to get "educated" in these crap fields.  
The rise in trade schools is upon us.  People are waking up to the true value of a 4 year degree and a life saddled in debt.  You're absolutely right, though.  Four year college as we know it is a huge scam.

BTC was designed to reward early adopters until the market cap is big enough to stabilize the volatility and thus be used as a currency. Satoshi knew that he needed to create an incentive to spread it.  Store of value comes first (aka digital gold).
When market cap is multi trillion the investment aspect is over. That's when the currency aspect of bitcoin will be unleashed. 
BTC was intended to be used for commerce and that can't happen in a meaningful way until market cap is multi trillion.  Big business can't do billion dollar transactions using BTC without moving the price too much, hence the need for liquidity and large market cap.
Early investors and risk takers got rich (or lost money) and now the world can benefit from the tech. Convert fiat to BTC and go.

UBI isn't to address fairness.  It's to allow capitalism to survive with automation tech putting many people out of work.  The elite and rich still want to make their millions but they know automation could have unintended consequences such as an overthrow of capitalism if too many people are out of work.  UBI is an attempt to save it.   If automation does not happen,  I would never support UBI.

completely false claim.  Stop getting your news and spin from comedy central.

If BTC succeeds then the market cap will be in multiple trillions and distribution of btc will spread out more.  A whale won't be able to crash the price in any meaningful way once market cap is that big.

We did use our common sense.  That's why we elected Trump instead of Clinton.  So happy that Trump is dismantling all of Obama's terrible policy.  MAGA

Communist coin for you. Life isn't equal or fair.  Some humans are smarter, or better looking, or have better health, etc...than other humans.  Wealth is no different. 
You will never have equal distribution of wealth as long as humans rule the planet.  You may not be able to fuck the hot chick but someone else can because he is better looking than you.  Capitalism is actually an "equalizer" in nature.  Why do you think that is? Because the ugly dude has the ability to earn wealth and gets to screw hot chicks despite being dealt a shit hand in the looks department.

 White people are the reason why this technology took off in this first place, just like most things the world enjoys.  Stop with the pie in the sky bullshit that we would be so much further along if we had trannies and gays and other races making decisions.  Where do you guys come up with this fantasy?  If you had legitimate factual data to prove your diversity assertions, that's one thing, but you're just making shit up because you think it sounds good.  We already have a ton of Asians on this project, but they don't count right?   Stop trying to force diversity with flawed logic.   
I'm just happy the masses are starting to wake up and take a stand against SJW.

Because you made the assumption that  an apache helicopter somehow meant white Americans bombing. Who's the one making this about race?  You are.   You do know that the driver of the apache doesn't have to be white, right?  If you plan on spinning this and stating that you were talking about the white guys calling the shots at the top of the food chain, Obama was President for the past 8 years.   If you don't get the joke  about the Trannies, there's no helping you.

He's just a useful idiot for the forces behind the dilution and destruction of white culture and influence around the world.  I get a sense that civil wars will break out all over Europe within a decade.  The USA is a tough nut to crack since they have to navigate around their 1st and 2nd amendments.

What did Facebook put out?  Please link it because to my knowledge the are refusing to release the info.  
  I don't care if Hillary was helped by the ads. That doesn't take away from my point.  The ads were not promoting Trump.  Isn't that the whole point of the investigation?  To prove collusion?

You are delusional.  99% of media is anti Trump.

Anti Trump you mean.  Everything in the media is anti Trump, except for Fox News channel.
Time warner, Disney, Viacom, GE, CBS control 90% of all US media.   This is a fact.  These entities control 90% of all US media.
They are all anti-Trump.    CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC, New York Times, LA Times etc...
