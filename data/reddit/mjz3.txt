I always find this so ridiculous. And in my opinion, you're response makes it seem much harder than it is. Buying Bitcoin is simple when you compare it to something like the early days of the web. The web has basically prepared us for the Bitcoin protocol for 25 years. Whenever you hear anyone say that "buying Bitcoin is hard or a challenge" you simply tell them about Coinbase. Why is there any need for further explanation? This is by far the easiest way to get into the game. Just like I did. You think buying bitcoin is hard, go to Coinbase. Done. This is also one of the most secure ways to store Bitcoin. Coinbase's security is insane. No need for this long drawn out explanation.

I don't see any down-votes buddy.

So what?
- Being skeptical doesn't change the fact that's it's still easy to buy Bitcoin.
- Could we get a list of these U.S. Banks? 
- The verification process is simple and I think I waited 2 days. But even if I waited 7 days, that doesn't make it hard to buy at all.

You would have to be a complete moron to not figure out how to buy Bitcoin.
If you want to talk tough at least say something that proves me wrong instead of looking like a clown.

That's fine, if you don't trust Bitcoin's security, then print off a wallet. It doesn't change the simple fact that it's still incredibly simple to buy Bitcoin in the U.S. using Coinbase.
