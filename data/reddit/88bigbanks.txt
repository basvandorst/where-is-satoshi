A bitcoin block pays around 6000 dollars in fees by printing new money and about 24 dollars per block on average in transaction fees. 
Actually processing transactions is of only marginal worth to miners so many of them frequently do not bother at all. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 18:19:58
Time for round a million of actual businesses sharing their actual experience with accepting bitcoin then the bitcoin community claiming that couldn't be true. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:01:21
Calm down, the price is up a dollar and fifty cents. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:51:40
Downvoted, circle is broccoli in mac and cheese that sneaks bitcoin into people and then somehow that will make them like bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-09-23 12:43:52
Why would any of those not be possible before? What exactly do you think it is that satoshi invented? 
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:57:05
Just sell the electricity. You'll make more.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:20:08
2015: the bitcoin community realizes that card companies require fees for processing transactions for an actual reason and not just because they are mean mean meanies. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:44:51
Yeah except in bitcoin the richest person is the person that got in first, the next richest people are the people that got in second, the third richest are the people that got in after the second richest, etc etc. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:43:34
You should probably mention that you haven't ever actually made a millionaire and the recent prizes have all been less than 3000 dollars, with only 10% of that being donated in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:21:33
You very likely would get your account closed just as much if you were running a weird exchange of photos of dogs you saw or something. They don't let you run standard accounts for any of that stuff, not just bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:31:23
In 1993 visa could handle over 800tps, in 2033 bitcoin will handle less than 10% of that, 40 entire years later.

Try to find one example anywhere in serious literature where someone talks about big O notation based on usage instead of as a measure of the algorithm itself.

pick up a business that failed to turn any profit? 
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:27:46
This is a large and important reason bitcoin can't become large. It only works like this, with people being trusting and the community being too small for people to get away with much. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:45:23
I think the fact you think you will get "a few million satoshi" while spending less than 500 dollars indicates you do not have realistic expectations.
@_date: 2015-09-24 02:26:42
The realistic answer is nothing happens. Bitcoin is small and inconsequential and no one cares. The larger answer is that if the blockchain gets commonly used for transfer of illegal material that you won't stop weirdo bitcoiners from using it and it won't make the protocol go away but it will end up poison to any legitimate business and most will give up the literally tens of dollars they could make by accepting bitcoin and not touch the blockchain with a ten foot pole it gets associated with requiring the download of a bunch of pirated movies and kiddie porn files. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:51:07
Made by the same guy that made that exchange you could buy Gox coins on after Gox closed that basically stole everyone's money.
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:48:08
Looks like you can use western union to send 500 dollars from a bank account to cash in Ghana for 5 dollars and cheaper if you use some other company (but western union is always the target around here). 
That doesn't seem particularly awful. After the first month is this going to beat that at all? In cost or safety or reliability? 
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:18:43
Okay, but what does it mean if bitcoin loses 90% of it's value over the course of a year and a half month by month in a ragged pattern? Like actually is what has happened instead of some weird claim the price is stable over any significant time period. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:55:26
I like that the bitcoin community has avoided promising that bitcoin will double anyone's money by just vaguely saying "moon" a lot so they can claim buying bitcoin gets you rich but without saying any specific number. (although a whole heck of a lot of people slip and say bitcoin is going to 10,000 a coin or 1 million a coin or whatever but I guess that isn't a scam because they never exactly promise it in writing). 
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:20:59
You still need to make 4200 transactions eventually. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 12:31:49
You may not have noticed but those 4 organizations also all regulate US dollars. Like they didn't just start to exist when bitcoin did. 99.999% of all their regulation is about US dollars. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:54:27
It would be 10 cents. Have you ever actually used a credit card? 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:29:17
Who would that terrible argument ever convince except people already following the bitcoin faith? 
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:12:26
So you should spend bitcoin on things you want and need but not on paying for your mortgage? What? 
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:22:26
Idea: take this as a lesson on why to just use normal people money next time so you don't end up like this. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:51:59
Maybe be honest about that then? That you aren't making a millionaire, and that the vast majority of it is using paypal. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:35:35
weird how it turned out you were lying about the cost. wanna share how you figure the spread so we can figure out if you are lying on that as well?
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:11:10
Some people got lied to and thought bitcoin was a currency that was meant to be able to be spent without having to lock it on a piece of hidden paper somewhere.

Oh cool, now not only can they not automate it by taking the money, now I'm gonna have to write a whole dumb schedule script if I want to automate it on my side. Sounds super convenient compared to just using normal people money!
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:31:24
That stuff needs to be self communicating, You can talk about how centralized fiat is but at least we don't have to follow obama's blog to know what kind of wallet we are using today. That stuff has to just work or it's a failure.

Bitcoiners dismiss altcoins the exact same way and for the exact same reasons people dismiss bitcoin.

Yeah, isn't money nice and accessible now that bitcoin isn't involved at all!
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:54:02
Landlines took actual physical objects being built. Literally hundreds of thousands of physical wires needed to be strung. Bitcoin is just some dumb software you install. Or some website you go to. The only reason to compare it to extremely complex physical hardware that physically needed to be installed instead of comparing it to other software is because if you compare it to software it looks like a failure. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:15:18

and having 12% of all the money ever invested in bitcoin be a big wet fart isn't great for bitcoin after months of trying to claim venture capital investment was the proof bitcoin is still growing and important now that the price is neither growing or important.

Wait, does he not actually know what big O notation is? You don't get to raise or lower the big O notation of an algorithm based on use. It's inherent to the algorithm. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:40:50
Bitcoin was supposed to be money, is he supposed to feel ashamed for using it as money? If the only correct use of bitcoin is to 'hodl" it and hope to get rich then bitcoin is a failure. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:53:24
Now remember that the only reason the fee is .023 is because the blockchain is still in a mode where the miners get to print themselves a bunch of money so fees need not actually cover the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 21:25:02
You don't, it's nonsense. 
No one is ever actually going to use bearer deeds for anything significant, with or without the blockchain. Like every movie ever made where someone has a bearer deed shows why they are such a stupid idea that no one would ever use.

The merchant's business model and the merchant's agreements with the credit card company are entirely their business and don't concern me. If it is labeled 10 cents I would pay exactly 10 cents.  
@_date: 2015-09-19 21:30:49
It's a tool. There is other tools for determining resources based on usage. Big O is static for an algorithm. An algorithm has a single big O value. There is no "this sort is N^2 but I plan to put it mostly in order so lets called it 2N because it'll be faster than N^2" 
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:22:59
Hey dummy, they are pushing the "don't use bitcoin" model now. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:55:38
Oh look! it turned out that credit card companies weren't just charging fees because they were some mean meanies and bitcoin companies are ending up in the exact same place after a few years!
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:17:36
I feel like I understand more why people think bitcoin is such a revolutionary technologies when threads like this come up and you get a glimpse that people think satoshi invented private/public key encryption and that that requires blockchains to work.

Largely by ignoring them and removing the blockchain from the equation and having an insecure system that is basically functioning on trust and on the fact that bitcoin transactions are so rare and gimmicky that every user is well known and transactions are only going to happen at all a few times a month.

@_date: 2015-09-25 16:56:55
I think you are stuck in bitcoin land logic where people flee from anything not decentralized. In real life I don't think most anyone would actually care a whole lot if it turned out paypal owned patents to most of the bitcoin infrastructure.

Dozens of coins have had halvings, not once has it made everyone that owns the coin suddenly rich nor is there any good reason it should. The narrative that it will in bitcoin is just wishful thinking based on giving people hope that this long nightmare of falling price will finally end and that it has an end date.

It's a scam, too much is premined, what we already use is already better, I don't want to switch for some dumb new fad, it's shadey, you can't spend it anywhere. 
Am I saying reasons you don't use altcoins or reasons no one uses bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-23 12:12:55
No where anywhere does that say braintree expects 500 billion in bitcoin, it is saying they expect 500 billion and also have optional bitcoin. That 500 billion will be almost all in normal old credit cards that everyone everywhere already use.
