Don't listen to most people on here.  Most are digital and forgot how to be analogue humans.  I totally get what you're saying and it's pretty true.  You might want to look up communities that are researching "self aware Earth" principles.  Our brain......if looked at without our own mind construct is just a lump of jelly.  Only reason we consider this lump of jelly profound is because our mind has understood that it lives within it.  If we step further out we can see the Earth but we don't look at it the same way(which we probably should).  Currently the Earth is developing the same neuro connections likened to the brain, maybe not exactly.  What will happen because of this? Who knows.  All I can say is I see a pattern that has come from 3 different networks.  The first is one the of first organisms on Earth, Mycelium(also a Bitcoin company who obviously knows their history). The second to develop similar traits are sentient brained beings on this planet and now we see Earth slowly developing this system in a bigger scale.  I love contemplating the possibilites of a self aware Earth and what it might bring.  If you look at pictures of mycelium connections, brain connections and current world wide web connections it won't be hard to notice the obvious similarities.

The currency is the most annoying thing about bitcoin.  Most can't grasp that programmable value is the heart of bitcoin's allure.  Programmable value can do as much as your creative mind can handle pondering.  Sending money fast is the first of millions of possibilities....and at the current time, the most boring of them.

I also could refute your argument by saying it's not a bitcoin but rather a "blockchain token."  If you start to realize how loose the bitcoin name is and how much it can be done away with you'll see how glued the whole community is to it's brand name and not to it's actual system.

If you guys can't understand what this man is saying.... Obviously its proven as to why Bitcoin  hasn't hit the masses yet.  He simply means its not quick and retarded simple for people to use.  All people give a chup about is to pull out their phone and press pay.  No addresses....not even the goddamn qr code.  All people want is to leave a tip and exit out of the restaurant as quick as their life demands it.  Its time for all these Bitcoin  geeks to get their heads out of their mining rigs and start coming up with solutions.

The fact that you fail to see the point is the reason you're a bit tard.  Everyone on here is blind seeing the "Bitcoin" logo that they forget it's just a distributed proof of work protocol that has attained psychological value(which is an amazing feat).  Miners....if they truly understand don't give a shit whether Bitcoin will be used in restaurants or not.  If you truly can see the future you will understand that companies like Circle......who are now slowly removing the bitcoin name from their wallet is going to be the first of many "Send your dollars to anyone in the world fast" companies that UTILIZE the bitcoin blockchain as the way to send it.  Dollars quickly exchange to bitcoin and are reformed into u.s dollar on the other end without the two people knowing it.  When this system is implemented more, the number of people buying bitcoin unknowningly will increase to insane amounts.  There will be 100's of companies using the bitcoin blockchain to aggregate money on the top end.  This is why Bitcoin will be insanely valuable.

Seriously though.......why doesn't Zuckerberg just suck it up and use the damn thing?  How hard is it for a guy who reshaped the social network not know how impressive the blockchain is.  I think the main problem is waiting for the time to scale bitcoin safely.  That's my guess and im sure marc andreeson is thinkin the same.  If facebook adopts it.....watch out blockchain bloat.

Your logic is still at child level.  It was cute but apparently you still don't get that the bitcoin currency logo mirage is the small step we have to take to finally move on from it.  Circle gets it............."U.S dollar payments feature incoming."  Apparently your genius logic didn't see that coming did it?  Bitcoin will burn off and the Bitcoin Blockchain will remain to support ALL financial systems.  You still will be able to transact with it no issue there........but I won't be calling it Bitcoin.  The Bitcoin Blockchain will remain under the surface but nobody will be using the name in normal conversation.

Ok Bit Tard.  Apparently you're still stuck on the token thing(3rd grade bitcoiner over here how cute).  That is already been established as to how the blockchain sustains value.  What you're not getting is the overrall bitcoin currency mirage that will ease itself out.  People will be sending dollars to each other USING the bitcoin blockchain but won't even know about it.  Look up Circle.com's new "U.S dollar payments" feature and do your research.  Even Jeremy Allaire knows what's up.  People don't give a shit about Bitcoin.  They just want to send their money insanely fast..........the only secret is that the network supporting this U.S dollar payments(below the surface) is Bitcoin's Blockchain.

Well companies use gold for other purposes regarding electricity.  I think what bitcoiners are hung up on is the fact that maybe it won't be the superstar currency everyone will use.  Maybe it'll just be like real gold and sit on the sidelines.   However........secretly it will be running all financial systems and be very valuable.  I don't mind giving up the bitcoin currency.  At this point it has already established it's ledger system as the open canvas to digital value exchange.

The only thing that is to be said in a counter argument is that android is built on a linux platform.  It's platform allows for many developments to bootstrap off of it, the only difference is bitcoin is also a currency.  That makes me contemplate that bitcoin is up for some insane value prospects.  Anything that major banks and credit companies can't do because of their country zones, bitcoin can.  How big is that?.....probably a fucking ton + 1.

The cards are tokens within the counterparty asset exchange.  So if you're an angry bitcoiner then yes it is an altcoin.  I would not call it an altcoin though, I would consider it an asset within the game that can be traded through counterparty.  Counterparty is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain so there's where you get happy knowing Bitcion is still involved.  Bitcrystals = XCP asset,  XCP asset can be traded back into Bitcoin.  Bleh.  Also on top of this, I think spells of genesis(if it became insanely popular) would be bad bitcoin blockchain bloat.  I believe that's why they did this and for that papa Bitcoin is happy.

Yeah we don't need a stinking card. Thanks for pointing out the fucking obvious.  If you were smart you would know that the world just can't change to your bitcoin fantasies at an instant.  A chameleon like debit card that utilizes bitcoin(all ingenico has to do is upgrade their systems for it....same with Verifone) and is able to have a company akin to bitpay convert it back to usd for the merchant is what we need.  Get your head out of your ass.

Even so, there would be a race to acquire all of those addresses and assuming one wished to profit they would sell their addresses to the highest bidder, like a domain name.

Buttcoin rocks.  You guys obviously can't take a joke.  I feel half of the buttcoiners are actually bitcoiners but hate the overall elitist personality of r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:19:58
What im talking about are actual technological uses of the blockchain itself that actually use the bitcoin blockchain as a verifier to their blockchain.  For instance factom is using the bitcoin blockchain as a small transaction verifier to their data structure to remove bitcoin blockchain bloat.  I dont invest in coins anymore that just say they are another currency. I look for innovative uses of the blockchain itself.

Most bitcoin retards on here miss the point of the blockchain and keep looking at the bitcoin mask.  Even though Satoshi gave it a name it's the blockchain that provides the real revolution.  You can already see various tech companies adopting the technology for their own use(it's OPEN source).  The only thing bitcoin has going for it now is the support of the miners holding the value up for the system.  Other than that it's useless.  It's a reality most on here won't face but it's right there in front of them.  The blockchain will evolve with or without "Bitcoin" and unless more companies start to leverage it's blockchain with their own goals there is no dependence upon it.  Right now Bitcoin's blockchain has no real solid reason to be the core of global financial use and it must find one.  Unless a major bank or some country finally submits and funnels their currency through it that will be "Bitcoin's" victory and all other blockchains will use it as a connector to their own projects/goals.  As of right now Bitcoin is just a currency exchange and nothing else.  Any other altcoin can provide the same utility and better to be honest just take a look without automatic judgement and hate.  If Bitcoin's own blockchain is to win it must finally have an absolute deathgrip on finance between banks.  That's it.....take it or leave it.  If you want to F the system that's fine, it's not gonna be worth that much though.  However if you 
make the system finally submit, your precious Bitcoin will blast to the moon.

Yeah Circle works awesome for me too. It takes a little bit for a confirmed account but it's great.  I dont need to hear "you dont own your private keys!!" I already know what im doing.  I have bitcoin for permanent stash and use circle for normal payments.  I agree, my friend wants to get circle but he's gonna use me as a way to get bitcoin.  No problems here.

Thank god you didnt get downvoted on this.....ive been trying to say this for the last year but these bittards wouldnt listen.  I fully support this and will donate if we can get a good film crew/concept.
There was actually video commercial i saw where alot of various types of people were transacting in bitcoin and every time it did it popped up in characters just how much thr spent.  A skateboarder was the primary focal character going around town.  It was good but still had some euro cheezyness to it.  Almost there but not quite.
