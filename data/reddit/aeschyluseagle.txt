Auditors do not need "crypto" experience.  They simply need to check that bank balances match what is being printed, they can sign NDA to not disclose bank information, but must put their name and reputation on the line as an auditor.  Your confusion on this simple yet obvious factoid is concerning.

3-7 day hold on fiat deposits.  What they should say is 7 days no exceptions. 
 Ridiculous fee structure.  Wont use again.

GE is selling outdated technology, on their power division they are dumping assets as smaller competitors are releasing better technology for grid solutions, at a better price point, with a more robust warranty.  I would be careful about investing in these behemoths which are very slow to adapt to changing landscapes.  Their growth now mostly comes from shedding profit centers and purchasing competitors(for revenue growth), unfortunately on the power side the competition is all private so they are shit out of luck on one of the most lucrative fast growing industries.
Source;  I work in power industry, and i see GE products being ripped out almost weekly as being obsolete, low quality, and difficult to work with.

Bitfinex/Tether is not inspiring much confidence at the moment.

Even if one was to conclude the document released was a proper audit(which it specifically stated was not the case).  They have also promised to conduct regular audits, and after printing so much in such a short time the doubt to me seems more than fair.

It leads to conflict of interest for his company to be working in the crypto space when this is the primary means of blackmail for hacked websites.  If hackers demanded USD you might have a point.

The public key infrastructure (PKI) security method is used to implement strong authentication, data encryption and digital signatures. “
“But instead of running a CA software on a computer, which requires backups, maintenance, etcetera, the CA will be run on a blockchain instead. When the single computer is replaced by a group of connected computers and when the code is accessible to anyone, PKI will be even more robust and trustworthy,”

That was a pretty pro-crypto article in my view, i don't think people commenting here actually read it.

I think he is mostly concerned about perception and not necessarily any ethical or moral issues, doesn't look good when you hold a bunch of bitcoin and are protecting website security and hackers are demanding bitcoin as payment to release your site that has been compromised even though you are running the security on it.
I don't read this has him putting an ethical response on it, mostly just PR.

I agree in the current state you cannot trust exchanges.  Use a cold storage solution or hardware wallet for good sleeps.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:39:56
Regulation is coming for exchanges, nobody would assume you could regulate crypto in any other way.  The fiat gateways will get regulated you will need AML and KYC to convert to fiat, this is inevitable.
