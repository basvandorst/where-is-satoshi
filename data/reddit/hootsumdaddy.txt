I mean stress by attack, it’s hash rate is much larger than ethereum and withstands any dos attacks on the network because of its pow system. Bitcoin is the perfect layer 1 to build on top of

There’s really no need to dump, bcash is dying on its own, have you looked into stats on the bch network? The hashrate and transaction volumes are laughable, it’s doing a pretty good job killing itself.

Bitcoin is unique in the size and power of its network, no altcoin comes close to being under the stress the bitcoin network is under, he is right in how he’s looking at bitcoin now, looking at the price right now is pointless imo, it’s the network and its capabilities that we should be watching and getting excited over. There’s like 8 scaling proposals out there and speeds are going to improve.
Altcoins work at the scale they are now, but if they were the size bitcoin is they would run into their own problems. Bitcoin will not be replaced by another crypto currency any time soon.

Yeah, that sounds about right, now, is it possible?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:41:58
Because of how the transactions are I don’t think spoofing someone’s number of intercepting transactions will be a problem, they wouldn’t be able to change anything once the transaction is signed. I may be wrong though.

I’ve been seeing GreenAddress being pushed a lot for iOS since it has segwit, but have any of you promoting it actually tried to use it as an everyday wallet? It kinda sucks honestly. I’ve been trying to use it for about a month now and it’s been nothing but frustrating. Every time you sign out of your wallet it makes you type your entire mnemonic to get access to your wallet, which is fine, because of security and what not, but they have an option that instead of typing it every time, you can enable a quick access pin so your still signed in, but needs the pin to access the wallet. Not only that, you can set your Face ID/Touch ID as a pin alternative... except it just doesn’t work... you’ll set the pin/enable Face ID and it’ll work the first couple times you try it, but then it just says it’s invalid and not accept it even if it’s all correct, even using the Face ID  it’ll say invalid, (which makes no sense me) 
You have 3 attempts to get in, and if it doesn’t let you in, it signs you out and you have to type your mnemonic to log back in. This next thing is honestly unacceptable, and makes the wallet unusable, once you retype your mnemonic back into the wallet it does the exact same thing as the pin, “invalid” which is terrifying. Even scanning the qr code for your mnemonic results in the same issue. This wallet almost requires you to either have your mnemonic saved as text on your phone in a note/password manager, which is a huge blow to security. Not only that, it’s so unreliable that even copy pasting the mnemonic doesn’t work most times.
The wallet is literally unusable, I feel like the only people that promote it are people that use coinbase/blockchain wallets and just downloaded it, did the setup, looked around and have never logged in again after that. 
Not only that it hasn’t been updated in like 8 months so it’s not like they even care to maintain the app. It’s honestly awful I recommend no one use it if you like to be able to use your bitcoin, (you know, take advantage of segwit? ) if anyone else has used it please tell me if I’m doing something wrong, I really want it to work, but it just doesn’t. 
The only semi good thing I’ve gotten out of this wallet was that I’ve now memorized my entire mnemonic, too bad it’s useless without a stable wallet to use it on.

Mining right now isn’t profitable if you have 1 computer regardless of how powerful it is, tbh it probably isn’t profitable with 100 computers either, you would need to have either free electricity (aka own the power plant/ be best buddies with the operators of it)
Or have the money to pump millions every couple months to keep your hardware up to date.
It sounds like you are just a person with a gaming pc or something, if that’s the case, mining will never be a possibility for you, 
You’d be better off turning your computer off and save on the electricity it is consuming being on
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:50:56

 No fee, just a slightly wider spread between the buy and sell prices, it’s usually like instead of buying at 6600, if that’s the current price, you buy at 6700.
It’s the easiest to use by far and the “fee” ends up being way less than the coinbase fees, with no stupid gdax workarounds for withdrawals, 
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:58:15
When I used to use coinbase, I would always have to call my bank and get put on a ‘VIP’ list because for some reason coinbase is recognized by my bank as being international (I am in US) and it would block any other time I would try to buy without calling and allowing international transactions first, if you remove your card, and don’t use your account coinbase (and if anyone gets into your account some how) shouldn’t be able to charge you,
If you want to use debit and have no fees and instant withdrawing, try square’s cash app

With a multi sig if the attacker gets all the keys, they are able to send the bitcoin and it’s gone for good, with this thing (if I’m reading right) even if they have all the keys, because of the delay and you’ll be able to see the first transaction when it happen, the funds can be perpetually locked up by the vault user and this may disincentives attacker’s from trying if they won’t be able to get the coins in the end

I dont expect it to rally all the way till the halving, I would be surprised if it hits ATH’s before the halving, the halving will start to decrease supply available to exchanges miners and traders, the demand staying the same with half the supply will increase price, 
Everyone is able to see it coming though and can price in the expected price increase, its really hard to tell what is happening with the price until some time has passed and you can look back on it with some hindsight.
Could be completely different and do something noone expect, who knows

Zap mainnet is a nice wallet on ios, not many issues, doesnt show unconfirmed incoming transactions, my only complaint
If your issue is performance it takes about a second to load the app, another couple seconds to sync since you last opened the app and thats it.
im running on iphone x and it doesnt use much storage, and doesnt slow my phone down if im opening it or running it in the background 
App size is 125mb after syncing and using it for a while,

BitPay has never done business with companies like these, that’s just how they are, they play by the rules, that doesn’t mean you can’t use bitcoin, just find an alternative that accepts bitcoin themselves and doesn’t use a third party like BitPay.
Also, not exactly sure what you mean by “canceling payments” they don’t have the control to cancel payments, if they are set up to process bitcoin payments to let’s say a porn site, I guess they could deny payments, but why would they have been set up in the first place?
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:30:36

@_date: 2017-10-08 05:58:27
I mean, some will waste their bitcoin sure, but using a prepaid visa is much more convenient then sending bitcoin to an address paying a transaction fee and waiting for it to confirm.  I can’t speak for the bitflyer card, but there’s no fee extra fee for loading the BitPay card, and I don’t see a reason to load more than you need if you plan on using it.
Hopefully this will change with lightning and transactions will be faster and more convenient than a card.

It’s only “risky” if you don’t know what you’re buying. The ones on amazon, for the most part, come unopened and are perfectly fine. If you get one with an open box and a filled out seed card, the device it’s self is probably still fine if you wipe it and make a new seed. 
The problems happen when you don’t know what you’re buying and you end up basically getting scammed. Haven’t seen any counterfeit hardware yet.
And ledger and trezor are pretty similar, I like the trezor because it’s what I use and I think the ledger looks like a cheap flash drive tbh, super ugly

You’re acting like they will stick with a failing coin, it will be obvious which coin will be the main coin after the split, and if they made the wrong call then they will make a 180 and try to recover from the bad decision, its not like a for profit company would blindly follow whatever they picked first, and ignore where the money’s at

Everyone panicking is just upset they payed the $30 extra in shipping direct and had to wait 2 weeks. The amazon ones are usually fine, you’d know right away if something is wrong. And if you’re super paranoid, get a weed scale and weight the thing to make sure there’s no extra shift inside. You’re wallet is more likely to just not show up from dhl than be a compromised amazon wallet.

Bitcoin gets a filled mempool all the time, it took an hour to find a block a few days ago and there were 10k+ pending transactions, and it took several blocks to work through them all. I would consider that congested too imo. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:09:48
If you mean lightning as the solution i am not sold on that yet, a lightning node is difficult for even tech savvy people to get working and the majority of the mobile “lightning wallets “ either don’t work, or are one way. Until there is a real star in the lightning wallet ecosystem. I don’t see lightning transactions having a large impact on bitcoin scaling as of today. Can’t speak for ethereum. They probably have bigger issues than scaling.
