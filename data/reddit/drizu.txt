The success of bitcoin doesn't mean the collapse of the dollar

This may be the dumbest comment I have ever seen here, and that's saying something.

Yes, you are the few enlightened ones. You must enlighten the billions of sheeple, for they are all irrational and brainwashed.

So I take it you don't have a response? It's true, it's an often repeated phrase. However, I didn't just pretend it stands on its own as a catch-all refrain that addresses all criticisms; instead, I addressed how the 'complication' happened, why it hasn't defeated the entire point of bitcoin as you claimed, and why it's unlikely to happen again.
You seem to be incapable of responding without snark/having a normal discussion, though, so it's unsurprising that that was lost on you.


There are many valid criticisms to be brought up about both of those things--bitcoin's deflationary nature and the blind libertarian/anarcho-capitalist circlejerking that goes on in the community, to name a few--but your "*I thought you guys hated central banks?*" argument wasn't one of them.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:23:20
I addressed that. We hate Gox too. Do you not see the people in this thread, and literally every other thread involving Gox, calling for Karpeles and everyone else involved to be jailed? It obviously isn't that we're *okay* with it--there was a petition to get him tried and everything--it's that we tried, and there's nothing else we can do.

So you flat out admit that there is no real proof...yet wholeheartedly believe that he is Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:27:40
Assuming Satoshi isn't Dorian: maybe he realized that Dorian was in danger due to Newsweek's actions and is attempting to protect him? Admittedly, it doesn't prove very much and consequently probably won't deter thieves from breaking in to his house (and it may have had the opposite effect, if anything), but his three choices were:
- anonymously denying being Dorian
- proving he is not Dorian by revealing his identity
- doing nothing
Given those choices, I think the best course of action would be the one he took--the first one. The second is obviously impossible because he just shifts the target onto his back instead, and the third is a valid choice but he may have figured that anonymously denying it was the better option because something was better than nothing...and it isn't like he was losing anything. I dunno, just a thought.

The reason Gox was able to do this to begin with was because they were one of the first exchanges that wasn't *totally* shit at being an exchange. Now that the market has matured and many other, more transparent options are available, we don't have to trust some shady exchange in order to even obtain bitcoin. This means that this insider trading bullshit probably won't be able to happen again, and thus bitcoin's original purpose of doing away with manipulation is one step closer to being fulfilled.
Any new technology has complications when it is first introduced, and allowing a shady exchange to gain power was one the Bitcoin community made. Even early on, many people saw the signs and knew not to trust them, but because they were first they gained power nonetheless. Eventually, the market would have put a stop to this anyway by utilizing transparent exchanges when they became available, but thanks to Gox's incompetence it happened quicker than it may have otherwise.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:35:31
I mean...we hate Gox too. And nobody (smart) thought that this wasn't possible with bitcoin to begin with. So I'm not exactly sure what your point is.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:42:10
"It's not about looking for things to support it..."
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:55:06
So you're saying that Bitcoin exchanges are going to do what Gox did again? Well, not necessarily. Gox never subjected itself to any internal investigations, unlike Coinbase or any other trustworthy exchange.
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:16:52
I'm aware, just using at as an example

@_date: 2014-02-24 03:37:20
It doesn't exactly inspire confidence when two members of what is known as "The Bitcoin Foundation" are found to be up to some shady shit within days of each other, especially when one is the CEO of what is/was the largest exchange.

You are the one backpedaling here. You were clearly talking about this sub, and now you're trying to change it into a scenario where you were only talking about OP. Your constant condescension is pretty humorous when you consider this.

That was a car spinning out and miraculously performing an amazing drift.

You aren't alone; I bought like $2 worth a few days back and now coinbase is making me wait until the 9th to buy more.
I'm black and I see no reason why black men would need style advice specifically for black men--especially for $30/month when so much information is available for free right here and other places on the internet. In fact, I find it ludicrous because it implies that there are things that black men should do differently than other races (and if not, what's the point of it being specifically for black men?). Can you explain this?
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:52:27


Yes it can...

How is that *not* a big deal?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:23:57


Because it was *clearly* a scam. If you needed this thread to tell you that, I worry for you.


OH NO NOT YOUR 'DATA' ON OBVIOUS SCAMS! PLEASE NO! /s

Exactly--we have to ditch the "hacker money" connotation if we want widespread adoption. While I admit that I think it's cool, that's only because I'm part of the computer generation. To the majority of the population it looks and sounds intimidating.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:19:25
You're not wrong, you're just an asshole. That guy up there is obviously misinformed but there was no reason to turn it into a contest to see who could call the other "kid" more.

IIRC we were told it would come before the new year, but things may have changed/might still change since then.

Nope. You need root access to manually install .ipa files, which isn't possible without a jailbreak.
Keep an eye on though--the 6.1.x and iOS 7 jailbreaks aren't too far off!
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:57:52
Try and find it, dude. Maybe hire some other people to help. You never know--it might completely pay off!
After all, crazier things have happened.

You're also the guy who tipped that dude who got his headphones stolen 1 BTC a while back, aren't you?
Damn. Just wanted to say thanks for being a stand up guy. It really warms my heart to see people like you who aren't miserly with their coins, even when they know how much they could be worth in the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:58:34
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:50:18
Well...'soon' is kind of being used liberally here. If you want to jailbreak ASAP, definitely stay where you are because the 6.1.3/4 jailbreak is looking like it's close to being ready.

[Because you started the major insults first.]( Of course, before that he said you had no idea what you were talking about, but that's only because *he* didn't know what he was talking about. Consequently, trying to argue with him is futile, and if you do try, approaching it with hostility at his ignorance will only disillusion him.
