This is an attack on bitcoin! Now more than ever we should focus on fundamentals: run a full node, validate transactions, maintain our financial sovereignty.
Next attack will be to try to steal control of development via hard fork. Repeat of segwit2x attack again. If we all run full nodes, they cannot steal our bitcoin!
Best way to lower fees is to demand exchanges (coinbase, bitfinex, etc) that they implement segwit support faster.

LN will reduce onchain usage, we don't know how much, but it will. This will dramatically reduce transactions fees. Makes sense to wait and see.
The core team has taken a safe conservative approach, for dangerous experimentation there are altcoins.

I paid a $2 fee and it confirmed fine. Fees will go down when segwit is widely adopted.

A much more important graph is transaction fees.
Just my opinion, but once fees go above ~$0.05 / tx, bitcoin's value starts bleeding into altcoins. On that chart that's equivalent to 14000 USD at 800 kB blocks.

Thank you for your post. This cannot be overstressed.
I think 0.1-0.2 tx/day/user would be enough for a settlement currency (not many transactions are done with gold), but either way, max userbase is proportionally dependant on the size of the blockchain. 
If we want bitcoin userbase to grow, the blockchain HAS to grow. There is no other way. Sidechains, etc don't change it, because we still need bitcoin to act as a settlement currency (0.1-0.2 tx/day/user).

Bandwidth is not the problem. BIP 101 requires very low bandwidth that's easily and cheaply accessible. The problem is current inefficient block propagation code.

Max block size would increase slower than bandwidth speeds, never growing too high.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:04:27
Keep in mind that Litecoin has been running effective 4MB max block limit and never had any problems. Gavin's suggestion is really conservative and should satisfy everyone.
Conservative safe start at 8MB and limit growth below projected bandwidth growth (doubling every 21 months).

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency. The decentralization is established with proof of work and clear rules for transactions.
Basically you'd need a way to make a decentralized blacklist.. How do you make it? If I say you stole my money and you say you didn't, how do we establish the truth in a decentralized manner?
A centralized blacklist is possible, but makes bitcoin centralized, which is not an option.

2 BTC or 2 bitcoins. Bitcoin(s) being a unit of account in this case.
It's a great inconvenience that both currency/system/network/commodity (bitcoin uncountable) and currency units (bitcoins) are named the same thing.
That's why the huge need to adopt bits.
Bitcoin - network/commodity. "I want to trade some bitcoin."
Bits - currency units. "I just paid 3500 bits for a game.".

I think you're on to something here. Bitcoin doesn't have Peter Schiff's "intrinsic value" and it's not backed by anything, but it has speculative value. That's how money is born - people speculate it'll have value in the future and want to acquire it in the present - the very definition of money.

The blockchain size doesn't matter. It can be pruned, stored on cheap HDD, special archiving nodes, etc. It's not a problem.
 
On the other hand, UTXO needs to be stored forever and on every full node. It needs to be quick to look up. A regular regular HDD will not keep up against an attack if a node is forced to validate random UTXO as inputs, the latency for random lookups is just too high.

This is actually better than autoscaling. Autoscaling could create a problem of too big blocks, with a limit of 20 MB, you know it won't be too big for ever. No permanent damage done.
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:25:07
20 MB limit is not high enough to cause any permanent harm to bitcoin even in the worst case scenario. Best case scenario - there are no problems at all.
Litecoin has been effectively running 4 MB blocks (1 MB * 4 faster) and litecoin's blockchain has never been abused. Bitcoin is 10 times bigger, more secure and decentralized than litecoin is. This is proof it's safe to proceed cautiously and 20 MB is exactly that - a cautious step forwards.

What is wrong with kicking the can down the road? You have a solution short term. You have a data point for future decisions. Win-win.
There will be no permanent damage to the bitcoin system with 20 MB blocks even if they're spammed. And if blockchain is abused, again, it's an important data point we will have.
5-10 MB blocks would be better, but 20 MB is not disastrous.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:20:29
OS caches disk data to have faster access. Caching is done in RAM.
LevelDB is also cached in RAM by bitcoind (-dbcache option).
This is relevant in some spam attack against bitcoin nodes. You could use full UTXO space to force nodes to lookup their UTXO, therefore UTXO lookup needs to be fast.

You can create transactions without making blocks. That was just an example of possible numbers.
Those are all valid transactions. A node verifies it and it's all completely valid. That's the problem. That's why verification needs to be fast, meaning UTXO needs to be in fast random access storage.

Tx input is like 80 (?) bytes. Assuming a malicious attack with 20 MB block that's ~250k inputs to check.
HDD latency is ~1 ms. That's 250 seconds to validate a block! Whole network is effectively dead. And you can spam completely valid transactions without having to mine blocks.
 
Again, there are solutions, just not a regular dumb HDD.

Lukoil doesn't even know they're accepting bitcoin and naturally they wouldn't be advertising that. They accept EUR through WoraPay (aka Paypal), which can be loaded with bitcoin.
In addition, you can't pay to a bitcoin address through the blockchain, it's not like Bitpay.

That's the future of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a voluntary system, let the people decide what they want to use. The only problem is naming, but it can be figured out.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:17:04
UTXO needs to be stored in fast access storage, because nodes need to verity transactions as quickly as possible. Doesn't have to be RAM, but a regular HDD doesn't cut it either.

So improve the networking code, if that's the problem.
Like I said, bandwidth is not a problem.
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:40:32
I strongly believe bitcoin will be the future and it's undervalued at the moment, however...
Keep in mind, that the price can go down lower. How will you feel if your 19k suddenly becomes 1.9k? Sure, you like bitcoin, but your wealth still decreased 10 times.
Perhaps sink 10k at these prices and keep 9k as a reserve to buy cheaper? If the price crashes, you buy cheaper, if it doesn't, you already have some bitcoin.

1. Yes. Offence would get much more expensive, defence would get cheaper.
2. Yes, it would stop inflation and inflation hurts the poor the most.
3. Recessions would still happen, but they would be much shorter. The economy would correct in 1-2 year, there wouldn't be 5+ year long recessions like right now.
4. It would make politicians less powerful, that would lower corruption overall.
5. Yes, resources would be more effectively consumed. For example, the housing bubble (caused by the Fed) resulted in massive of malinvestment. If green peace activists actually cared for the planet, they should be fighting central banks and promoting bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-06 19:49:46
Currently with BIP100 if 20% miners vote low or do not vote at all, the block limit will *never* increase.
BIP101 is simple and predictable. It keeps the blockchain small enough to afford full nodes and big enough for the system to grow. That's why I support BIP101.

$.10 fee per tx is already pretty high.

In addition, no votes are counted as current limit votes. So in practice, you would probably only need 10%-15% malicious miner to permanently freeze the limit at 1MB. Hell, if 20% of miners never bother voting and the limit would never change at all.

@_date: 2015-11-30 11:25:33
BIP 101 requires less than 1% of what you can get ~~in a datacenter~~ at home [edited] cheaply. It's quite conservative. Bandwidth costs are a negligible fraction of miner costs.
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:50:19
Bitcoin could fail because some altcoin will have higher transaction capacity and over time could become a better store of wealth.
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:05:19
I run a full node at home and I would continue running it with BIP101. I have the upload bandwidth to support bigger blocks, as many other people also do. This would be even a lesser problem in a data center.
It's important to note that BIP101 increases only the maximum limit, but the actual blocks would be smaller, it's just a max.
@_date: 2015-03-07 04:53:09
We have already seen fractional reserve bitcoin. It's nothing to fear, because you can always request real bitcoin delivery very quickly, cheaply and easily.

You can have both - a bit bigger blocks (8MB) do not make the network centralized. I will run a full node from home with BIP101.

Litecoin has 1MB per 2.5 minutes, which is 4 times more than bitcoin at the moment. BIP 101 is about maximum block size limit, it's the limit, not average.

BIP 101 is the only implemented solution out there. It's install-and-run. It's been tested and is being tested. There's currently a BIP 101 testnet running with blocks of all sizes.
BIP 101 is massively being discussed on other bitcoin subreddits, but it's being censored in this one.

Agreed, there needs to be proof that bitcoin can adapt and grow. We had believed that bitcoin would incorporate all the technological advancements from altcoins, therefore altcoins are doomed. Now it seems like bitcoin is unable to change!

Yes. The network can support a much larger block size in a decentralized manner TODAY. It's somewhere in the 8 MB - 20 MB area.

0.2 tx/user/day - that's minimum for direct access

No problem to use a centralized payment system if it's more convenient and cheaper. Centralized solutions are always more efficient in small specialized uses. The counterparty risk is often acceptable trade-off.

Decide your BTC:fiat allocation. Depends on your finances, income, age, family status, etc.
If you have studied bitcoin and understand it, you can go higher than normal, but remember that bitcoin is risky, it can go to $0.
Once you have calculated how much fiat currency you want to exchange into bitcoin, do it gradually. Don't try to time the market. Average the price over time. You'll be happy if the price drops and you'll be happy if the price grows.
Have a backup plan what to do if bitcoin price crashes down. If you believe in bitcoin, that would be a great time to buy. But everyone will be scared and it will not be easy.
Basically, just plan plan plan and then stick to your plan.

If the idea of gold - it being accepted everywhere for purchasing goods fails, than demand for gold falls. And its value eventually falls to zero.
Yet gold can undoubtedly go on forever and is not a pyramid scheme.

Your math seems off. I will analyse it from another perspective: new money created.
There are only 6*25 BTC created each hour. That's 157500 USD in new bitcoin created each hour. No one would spend $1,372,338 for $157,500.
Bitcoin "cost" (inflation in new money): $157,500 / hour.
Litecoin inflation in new money: $41,580 / hour.
I would argue that bitcoin is where it is, but litecoin is in a huge bubble. Litecoin is unsustainable and the price will collapse. Bitcoin price might be sustainable.

Decide what % allocation you want to put in bitcoin. Maybe it's something like 5%-10% for you, not more. Bitcoin is amazing and it can take over the world, but it can also go to 0.
Calculate the sum you want to convert from USD to bitcoin. Average it over time, do not try to time the market, do not convert everything at once. Don't be afraid to buy even when the price is falling - that's the best time to buy (assuming the fundamentals are still sound).
Basically, try to find a strategy that will make you feel good if bitcoin goes to 0 and if bitcoin goes to the moon. It's possible!

Produce more than you consume. Save the rest.
Hoarding is just keynesian word for saving. No sane person can believe that saving is harmful to the economy.
When you hoard bitcoin, it means you trust bitcoin enough to save in bitcoin. Best money is the most trusted money, so hoarding bitcoin is good.

Mining is techy and geeky. You should be able to figure out the stuff yourself.
1. Google mining bitcoin/litecoin. Look for guides that focus on mining with gpu.
2. Install AMD catalyst drivers
3. Install cgminer
4. Find a pool
5. Point your miner to a pool
6. Make sure your hardware doesn't burn
7. Confirm that you're getting decent results 
8. Earn LTC (or other altcoin).
9. Move LTC to an exchange and sell for BTC. Btc-e.com is the most popular LTC&lt;-&gt;BTC exchange.
10. Withdraw BTC and use BTC :)
For what a random internet stranger's word is worth to you, I think litecoin is in a huge bubble and it's best to sell LTC and hold BTC.

I'd talk about morals.
Bitcoin is honest money.
Fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc) is by design immoral. It steals wealth from the people through inflation and debt, creates huge distortions in the economy (youth unemployment, 2008 crisis, etc). Fiat currency then funds big banks, corporations with political connections, wars, drone strikes, spying programs, etc.

There is a critical mass of people that know about bitcoin and trust bitcoin. They know bitcoin is not a ponzi. They would like to own more bitcoin. With the media attention and the widespread knowledge about bitcoin, the current price is a screaming buy.
As time goes on and BTC prices rise, those people will panic buy. That will be a big bubble! Not yet though, but we're ready for it.
When bitcoin gets to $1000-$10000, the media and "economists" will start calling it a ponzi once again and we'll have a nice 50% crash.

As I understand his logic:
"Intrinsic value" = industrial value. Bitcoin has no industrial value, therefore no "intrinsic value". He does not allow other "intrinsic value" other than industrial. Bitcoin could give you blowjobs, but it would still have no intrinsic value, because it's not industrial.
Utility value of gold or bitcoin as money (portability, divisibility, durability, fungibility, etc) does not matter to him.
That is a clear mistake, because there are metals that have much higher industrial value than gold and they are worse money than gold. Bitcoin of course has extremely high use value due to having a payment system and being cryptographically protected.
I really did not know money had to have industrial value. If this is true, then he is correct. However, I'm happy to bet that the market will prove him wrong.

Exactly this! The only area where gold is better than bitcoin is that gold has industrial value. For Peter Schiff industrial value = intrinsic value. Bitcoin does not have industrial value for the obvious reason that it's digital.
Bitcoin has much higher use value than gold though. I think he's overrating the industrial value. Money doesn't need to have industrial value. If there is such a theory about money, time will prove it wrong.

Bitcoin is not backed by anything in the sense, that you are not guaranteed any fixed amount of goods or services for bitcoin.
You are not guaranteed anything for gold or USD, either. Bitcoin doesn't require backing, the same way gold doesn't require backing.
In the broader meaning, bitcoin is "backed" (given value) by the people who use it.

Don't even say bitcoins are mined, bitcoins are released into existence at the predefined rate.
2. I would suggest adding the immoral aspects of the fiat currencies: inflation and government debt. If USD were the perfect money, bitcoin wouldn't make sense. It's the fact that USD is very bad money, that makes bitcoin so much needed.

I'd argue morals.
Bitcoin is honest money.
Fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc) is by design immoral. It steals wealth from the people through inflation and debt, creates huge distortions in the economy (youth unemployment, 2008 crisis, etc). Fiat currency then funds big banks, corporations with political connections, wars, drone strikes, spying programs, etc.


Unfortunately people with morals are weird in the current society. Maybe it's stupid to buy bitcoin, but at least it's the RIGHT thing to do.

Most people do not understand that if they're not making a financial decision, they are still making a decision to stay in fiat (USD, EUR, etc) or in bonds. Most people consider that safe, but in fact it is extremely dangerous if you agree that fiat currencies are going to collapse at some time.
The biggest change will happen when the everyone suddenly understands that the previously considered safe haven is in fact the sinking Titanic. By that time, it'll be already too late for them.
