I keep thinking the far left and far right have much more in common than many would believe. Maybe if we can find common ground....

That is interesting if there hasn't been another Democrat running for her seat, because CA has [top-two voting]( They put everyone from every party on the same ballot in the primaries, then the 'top two' - could be two democrats - go head to head for the general election. Last year for one of the US Senate seats in CA, you could only vote for democrat A or democrat B because they were the top two in the primaries. 
This means, obviously, the democratic party is not allowing any other dems to run against her. I wonder what she's done for the party to get that cushy deal...

This just pisses me off to no end. They like to push it in our faces.

Does the US government still own a lot of BTC?

This is why I love crypto. That fractional reserve crap is a way for the banks to steal from the have-nots imo.

And they just have the Federal Reserve print more money.
