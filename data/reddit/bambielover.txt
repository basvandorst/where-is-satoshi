Everything moves on speculation....every stock. Money in a new form if it is easier or cheeper is always adopted. Bags of beans in the Americas-to debit cards and direct deposit. Improvement is more powerful to humans then sex. Innovation = humanity. Crypto currency is the best thing since salad in a bag. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:37:26
Yes but you get charged for the exchange rates with every purchase and and international charge is taken as well.... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:29:53
Ya I hope that ceo of bitcoin doesn’t screw us over..... ;)

Price goes up. People sell. People who know money wait for panic and swoop in buying at a lower price. Those who hold will be rewarded. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:29:04
I’m in the same boat. The same boat. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:37:56
I did :) 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:17:02
So is crypto currency more dangerous than I’m thinking it is? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:56:01
Call it anything as long as the price goes up I could care less why people adopt it.

Not number of travelers but creating a destination with one thing that is easier for people in a foreign land....it would attract more of those who do travel.

Having and account that’s two weeks old and a name that corny. You must have a hog to have that much confidence in an area where Boone knows who anyone is...
