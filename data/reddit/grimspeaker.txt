I think they are still accepting new members.

That would be neat, but could also make it less accessible still.

I call bullshit.  Sure, a hardware key should cost money.  But SMS authentication should not.  If they are a target for SMS flooding, that means they are capable of making a lot of money if they charge for it.  There are simple ways to protect against flooding such as 1 authentication per hour, for example.
If they really want to regain their trust they should not charge for security features that they should have had in the first place.

Use [MyBitcoin](  It is an online wallet.  I can't garauntee that they won't get hacked, but at least then you won't feel as bad about it.

Any bank to bank transfer will be slow for individuals.  It is about liquidity.  The whole point of a bank is to keep your money so they can loan/invest/etc it for profit.  If it is easy for you to remove remove your money, then that hurts their profits.  This is why you can usually pay a fee to expedite it.  I agree that it sucks, but this is part of the inherent value in bitcoin: quick and cheap.

You're obviously not the person to be giving advice then.

If bitcoins are in short supply, it almost makes me think that the demand should increase and therefore the price as well.  But I'm no economist and it's not like bitcoins have a economic history to base theories off of anyway.

I, too, am in the telecom business and I realize that MO/MT sms is not free.  However, these guys are making plenty of money to allow a bulk sms plan to cover this.  You shouldn't sell security, you should sell a service that comes with security and their trading fees should cover the cost of this service.
