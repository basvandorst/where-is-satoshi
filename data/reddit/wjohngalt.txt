I don't know why do you think average joes would start "running bitcoin" (whatever that means) if we increase block capacity. I do see segwit and layer 2 solutions as part of the p2p cash system. They require onchain scaling as explained on the lightning network whitepaper and as expected from even bitcoin's core road map after schnorr signatures. The problem is that we need this now to keep the network effect, not in 2 years. 
Successfully spamming a high-blocksize blockchain that has even 10 cent fees per average transaction is very, very expensive and not feasible at all.

Yea it's a bit disgusting how reddit users are rating the app with a 1-star claiming they lost their funds by depositing bitcoins into their bitcoin cash address when in fact the wallet uses the same address for both coins and therefor funds cannot be lost.
I think this is against the "no brigading" reddit rule

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:55:51
It can be managed transparently by your wallet. You receive an invoice payment request, scan the qr code and the wallet automatically checks your 10 networks and tells you if you can make the payment or if you need a new channel. But yea hopefully not too many networks will be necessary at the same time.
Technology is still infant and will have to see how it develops.

I thought you guys wanted to delay block sizes increases for a bit longer, why then push to increase the blocksize as fast as possible but only through segwit?
Asking for a 2x blocksize hardfork seems like it would be a more effective way of increasing the blocksize than bullying exchanges and users into adopting a technology that's not even available in the GUI of bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:40:21
The user you replied to asked "can you explain how much are you saving in fees using segwit". You answered "you may only see it's effect if enough people use it"... 
The highway doesn't need to "open up" (whatever that means) for fees to be reduced using segwit. And the "opening up" of the highway is not guaranteed even with massive segwit adoption considering we have a huge volume of new users this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:57:01
As a side note, replace by fee was always part of the protocol. You were always able to rebroadcast a transaction with a higher fee in hopes that the miner will pick that transaction instead.
It was just later added the option to the UI of popular wallets.

Onchain scaling was obviously his roadmap since even before releasing bitcoin (saying he was "only 3 months in" is misleading cause it dismisses the year of development that went before release) and he never retracted it. Moreover his comment about being able to have the network working with a few farm servers acting as full nodes still holds true even if we now believe that doing it that way has too many centralization risks.
Moreover, saying "anyone in bitcoin knows" would still be hiperbolic even if Satoshi retracted himself from his idea of onchain scaling because it dismisses the tons of developers and smart people that support onchain scaling like Gavin Anderson himself, who is the successor of Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:32
Blockchain acts a settlement layer in case someone tries to cheat you. It's the security layer. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to go offline without risking being cheated on.
Also I think the idea is to split the blockchain into more private networks so nodes don't have to sync and verify thousands of transactions per second. So maybe in the beginning you'll have local networks for local payments instead of a global massive Lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:36:38
Yes I've read about the problem with loans too. Passive income is nice but you can get way more than 2-3% yearly return even with passive income. And, as you said, there are other factors driving rich investors like their desire for power or their desire to contribute something tangible to the world. I don't think they would be contempt with just holding and holding money.
My fear is that this mainstream belief in economics that inflation is obviously the best is driven by governments that benefit from their ability to print money and do indirect taxation that way.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:12:37
Except that from the very beginning it was said to be a peer-to-peer cash system. Cash means usable for commerce imo. Even the welcoming video in bitcoin.org says it allows you to transact "with almost no fees". Right now that welcoming video which has millions of views and growing is just a bold fat lie to new users. It's unethical to advertise bitcoin as that when apparently no one from that websites thinks it's one of its key use-cases.

It's not clear that it's deliberate. They had to increase their support team like 30x and are barely able to keep their services up cause bitcoin grew so much in such a short amount of time.
They also have the development team involved in adding hardforks support and all that and users weren't pressing for segwit adoption until recently.

I also do the encrypt your private key with a password thing, and genuinely curious on why you think the computer must never connect to the internet... this is what I do to my computer before and after typing my password:
1. Disconnect the internet cable and all non-volatile memory (hard disks, SSDs, etc).
2. Load Ubuntu into the RAM and plug in a pendrive with some tools to encrypt the private key and optionally with an unsigned transaction to sign it. Copy those files and *unplug the pendrive*.
3. Generate your private key through the "sha256sum" linux command and some dices. Copy it to an encryption tool and "type" in the password using the mouse (copy paste the characters using the mouse, in case your keyboard has a hardware keylogger or whatever) to encrypt it. Open a different, totally independent encryption tool and decrypt it to see that the first tool did everything right.
4. Get a QR Code of your encrypted private key and your public address and scan it with your phone to get (make sure your unencrypted private key is not showing on the screen).
5. Turn down and unplug your computer from the electricity. This erases all RAM memory and other volatile memory.
6. Pass the scanned QR Code into a pendrive and kinda repeat the process to decrypt the privatekey through the offline computer to see that everything works well. Then plug the computer off from electricity again.
That's it, then I plug all the non-volatile memory back in, internet cable and electricity and keep using my computer as I normally do.

This allows bitcoin to do both micro and macro transactions thanks to layers on top of it. It's the best way to allow the full range of transactions and keep the system decentralized and highly accessible. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:06:00
You can lock a month's worth of payment in a single on-chain transaction and use it to make hundreds of payment to anyone on your network with no fee. This has the potential of reducing the amount of transactions on-chain by several orders of magnitude because you just do 2 transactions on-chain (opening and settlement) and are able to perform payments for weeks (or maybe even months thanks to group fund-rebalancing, as proposed in latest whitepaper).
Moreover, since there is no way to cheat the LN you don't need to settle your payments until you need the bitcoins to pay someone who is not in the network. Ideally we will have a giant network and settlements will almost never be necessary.
What are you talking about with this doesn't reduce fees?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:49:04
That's what I was planning to do but since mods sticked that thread about please migrating to segwit I figured I should ask.

It can support way more than even VISA levels if you accept the systemic risks that come with a higher blocksize though. 


Satoshi thought Bitcoin would reach this levels without layer-2, as constantly likes to remind us. He might have been wrong or his solution might be too risky, but still the statement "anyone with any knowledge about bitcoin knows this" dismisses too many smart people working on on-chain  solutions.
For streams of microtransactions and nanotransactions yes we would need layer-2 solutions. Layer-2 solutions can also lower the amount of small transactions that need to happen in the blockchain, thereby reducing the necessary blocksize and therefor the systemic risks involved with a high blocksize.

It's not just that he has the private keys of the bitcoin address, it's the fact that the wallet you are mentioning is compatible with bitcoin and it uses the same address for both bcash and bitcoin, so this scenario just cannot happen ever.
There is no "BCH address" different from the bitcoin address. They are both the same. It's impossible to make the mistake you are claiming even if you are a confused kid.
Also the whole story is nonsense, it's such an obvious low effort attempt to bash BCH
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:15:31
Gabridome already addressed several of your concerns but I wanted to add that your assumption of people doing 5 transactions a month comes from the fact that we don't have lightning network. But if we have a huge LN people can lock a quite high amount of bitcoins and use it for hundreds or thousands of payments.
Also in the future they might choose to get their salary through a LN channel that was opened from before and just use their salary inside that network. In that scenario there would only need to be a transaction from the company or the exchange every now and then to refund one of their lightning channels. They can then pay all their employees or users through that refund, so it can be just 1 transaction for dozens or hundreds of salaries.

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:06:27
That's not true. Using a segwit transaction immediately lowers your own fee by 30-40% independently of if anyone else is using it. Because part of the bytes of your transaction will be outside the blocksize limit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:17:08
Correct. You can put say 1 or 2 months worth of payments in a channel and use it to pay or receive payments from anyone in the network.

I've seen other schools of thought point out that you could say that of electronics: why buy an smartphone today if I can get one better next year for the same price. Or why buy a computer today if I can buy it next year for much less price.
And yet electronics is a thriving industry. People seem to want their iPhone 8 NOW instead of their iPhone 6 plus even though it doesn't provide much more value.
Same thing seems to happen with the automobile industry. Cars are a liability and yet everyone in this sub apparently wants an expensive lambo instead of a cheaper but functionally-solid car.
Seems like people will consume even if it's a liability to their personal economy. It's almost as if they work so they can get things they want instead of just accumulating wealth and never using it!
I'm honestly curious if you have any solid refutation/explanation for that argument.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:15:28
No, mining is a very competitive environment because as soon as there is more profitability, miners buy more equipment and immediately both the electricity bill and the difficulty to mine raise.
They wouldn't just be "losing out some profit" they would go bankrupt. They need to pay their bills in fiat and don't have enough liquidity.

Lol dude calm your tits I'm not invested in shit nor I'm a shill. You really are agreeing with me you just have your head too deep inside your own ass to realize it.
I agree that segwit2x was an attack on bitcoin, but having bigger blocks (in a tested, consensus-based way) is part of bitcoin core roadmap.
So the problem with this 2x was indeed the way it was done: the backdoor agreements, the paid nodes and all the other things you correctly pointed out.
Do you think every single developer that thinks bigger blocks will probably be needed eventually is automatically a shill? Please dude get your head out your ass. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:16:09
Are you agreeing or disagreeing with what I said? Your tone seems like you are disagreeing but it seems like you are agreeing that the problem was the methods used and not the plain idea of eventually having higher block sizes

You know that would freeze for weeks every exchange that is not aware of this hard fork right? As they need to update and retest their software. It will also dilute their money with BCH being generated every 2 minutes.

Bitcoin will be the first one pushed to develop it and it will be the one with the most infrastructure built around it. It has *the most probabilities* of being the one successfully adopting as scaling.
Remember other protocols like ethernet and IPv4 were not perfect and arguably not even the best ones available... But they were the first ones and they were *good enough* and that's what we used. IPv4 eventually upgraded to IPv6 which still is not the best. Ethernet went on to receive several upgrades too
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:29:05
Blocks are meant to be consistently full, otherwise you'll get a lot of systemic risks like people not being efficient with the blockchain.
You say that all transactions should be legitimate, so I assume you want fees close to 0. If fees are close to 0 people will use the blockchain for microtransactions and blocks will fill up again no matter if it is 2mb or 8mb.
Say you put it at 8mb hoping that LN will be deployed before fees get above 10 cents; now your blockchain grows 8 times faster than before with each block, which means that in 2 years the blockchain will be a few terabytes long instead of just a few hundred gigabytes. This has consequences on how many people can set up a node (lots of ISPs only let you download a few hundred gigabytes per month).
But 8mb blocks are probably not going to be enough for microtransactions before LN is deployed, so your changes would have only made people use the blockchain more inefficently and solved nothing. Now you have a blockchain that is harder to handle for nodes and easier to attack for governments and banks.
It's just risky. If bitcoin goes that path it will be likely be replaced by a more secure crypto coin with a smaller, newer ledger.
This path Core has chosen requires patience and puts bitcoin in some awkward positions sometimes, but in my opinion is the least risky for the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:14:46
Because users will move to exchanges that do implement the LN. It's called market pressure. Exchanges need to compete against other exchanges.

Why do you keep trying to interpret my psychic question in a literal way?
I'm not making any educated guesses cause I'm not trying to claim which possibility is true or which one has more probabilities or which one has high probabilities.
What I described wasn't dependant on Satoshi being good. I explained why he might do that even while being selfish.
If you think there is a strong possibility of the coins not being lost, why are you trying to claim that there is a *high probability* of it being the contrary? You still haven't answered the **only** thing I'm challenging you on: your lack of evidence to support a *high probability* on keys being lost
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:56:25
There are other scaling technologies being developed, most notably the lightning network, which will allow secure transactions to happen off-blockchain in bulk and then only the final result of hundreds or even billions of transactions are committed to the blockchain.
The blocksize will still have to increase at some point, but these other technologies might save us several orders of magnitude in blocksize
Bitcoin can't fully scale just by blocksize: it would destroy it
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:13:13
What a ridiculous troll. There is no reason nor evidence to assert that there is a high probability of lost keys.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:59:28
Yes I can read. Seems like you don't. Here, maybe if I say like this you can read it: 
How can you determine that there is a high probability or even make an educated guess about it? I see it perfectly coherent that Satoshi, wanting to preserve his identity and the stability of bitcoin, sees no reason to try to withdraw his bitcoins from the public transparent ledger.
He certainly has thousands of bitcoins *outside* those early blocks and therefore might see only downsides in moving bitcoins from early blocks.
He is/was a very careful man. There is no reason to believe in a *high probability* of him losing his private keys or of him being already dead and giving those keys to no one. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:09:51

If a node drops out the transaction will be re-routed in a different way like it happens in the Tor network what are you talking about?
This will be transparent to the user and handled by wallets
EDIT: I see that the whitepaper mentions this in the Risks section. That the group node might be divided in two if a connecting node stops cooperating. That makes sense.

Bitcoin is too big to be made illegal imo tho.
You tell me to zoom out, but the more I zoom out the more obvious it's that holding is the better deal.
I have a lot of confidence in bitcoin as a technology and that's what matters the most. Markets can do their bear shit and governments can do all FUD they want but they can't make the technology stop being revolutionary.
Tons of improvements coming this way with Schnorr and LN. Bitcoin is still at the top of development.

What I'm trying to explain to you is that the bitcoin is not stuck at the payment channel, instead, it's "stuck" at the NETWORK OF NODES. They can use the money of 1 channel to trade with any other node in the network, even the ones that are not directly connected to them.
So, in other words, the exchange can use the coins they got from Bob through the LN and sell them to Sarah (assuming Sarah is another node of the network) without settling any payment channel and without paying any fees in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:40:24

You do understand that lightning network is a network right? Exchanges have the money they get from the lightning network available to exchange it with any other node instantly. They don't have to settle the channel nor create weird tokens.
There will never be a proof of solvency even if we never use LN.

LN will probably be released next year and wallets and exchanges will start introducing it in the next 1 or 2 years. So 2020 for LN to be fully deployed and used by most users. During all this the intermediate layer proposed on this whitepaper will (hopefully) be developed and introduced in 2021, with exchanges and wallets taking 1 or 2 more years to completely introduce it.
So the dream would be 2023-2024 for bitcoin to become a worldwide decentralized trustless means of transaction that even poor people in Africa can use with very small fees (assuming we keep increasing the percentage of people in the world with access to the internet as we've been doing).
Even if it takes 50 years it's worth it, what's your problem?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:50:01
I'm cheering as weak hands get out of the market leaving more bitcoins in strong hands, which is always necessary before the next spike up.
You see, every time bitcoin doubles in price like it happened in the last month it means that we get a ton more new users. A lot of them have weak hands and they need to transfer their bitcoins to strong hands before we can bull run to new all time highs!
This is the cycle we've always had in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:39
There are no coins that can scale today, what are you talking about? Other cryptos have low fees because they have a low amount of transactions.
If a coin goes worldwide people will use it for micro transactions as long as the fees are low enough. So if you want to keep the fees at less than 2 dollars without LN at a worldwide scale you would need blocks larger than a terabyte. This is a terabyte every 10 minutes. And if you are going to do that you will be extremely centralized.
We all need to wait for good off-chain solution and right now that's LN. This applies for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:38:00

It's standard mining strategy. I don't remember the details but it had to do with the fact that they start mining before they can finish verifying the previous block and know which transactions from the mempool were included in the previous block.
They just read the header of the previous block and start immediately mining while they are verifying the previous block separately on different equipment. If they find the next block extremely soon, they will not add almost any transactions because of the risk of adding a transaction that was already included in the previous block (which would make their block invalid and orphan)

You can follow the hashrate swing at  you can see historically how hashpower swings back as soon as the EDA kicks in. You will see it again tomorrow.

@_date: 2017-11-12 15:41:55
What happened is that bcash (BCH) price spiked up while bitcoin spiked down. This makes bcash have way more miner profitability until difficulty adjusts. This means that bitcoin loses hashpower and therefor blocks come at a slower pace, filling up the mempool with unconfirmed transactions and making fees skyrocket.
Fees will get back to normal after difficulty adjusts and hashpower inevitably comes back to Bitcoin.
You can follow the profitability of both chains here: 
Expect fees to go down to normal in 3 to 4 days.

If you make a low fee transaction 24 hours before the hard fork happens and it doesn't get confirmed before the hard fork you will have a confusing situation cause you will have to check in which blockchains it finally gets confirmed and then acting accordingly or if it got confirmed in both.
If you were sending your coins to someone else, he might have expected to have your coins in both blockchains but find out that you still own your coins in one of the blockchains. But yea, you can't really lose coins yourself.

Do you feel nervous about the possibility of getting hacked with that amount of money? What do you recommend to store large amounts of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:45:23
You keep talking as if bitcoin has 0 value. "Every time you buy a bitcoin you lose all your money, and you can only regain it if you trick someone into buying it". There is no tricking someone. Is a store of value.
**All early adopters will gain a lot of money** if bitcoin ecosystem grows (if more people are willing to use it as a store of value). No one has to lose money because **there will always be someone willing to buy your bitcoins.**
The ~10 million USD/day going to miners is only going to happen during the first stages of bitcoin (inflation halves every 4 years). But this is not a problem because in the early stages bitcoin is growing so much that **all** early investors **will always** earn a lot of money (unless they do something extremely dumb like sell too early at a low).
And later adopters will not lose money as long as there are people willing to buy bitcoins, which there will be. Bitcoin will continue to grow at a lower rate for generations as it gets better and better. And after that, bitcoin will become deflationary as new coins halve to very small amounts and some coins are lost (e.g. by people dying without providing a way for their family to recover their coins, etc.)
So, even though it is a negative-sum game, like fiat and gold are, bitcoin is way superior to those and will perform much, much better.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:44:53

Yea but that's not the argument I was responding to. That's completely unrelated. Miners will mine the most valuable chain so if most users sell S2X coins and buy bitcoins then miners will have to mine bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-10-21 03:15:16
because they signal they S2X support in the blocks they mine. Currently 80%+ of blocks mined the last month come from miners who explicitly signal S2X support.
Support doesn't mean they will mine the contentious hard fork, it just means that they support the idea of a 2x increase in size block. They might still be against contentious hard forks above all, or they might like the hard fork but not be willing to put all their resources into it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:28:29

First of all you are assuming that you will have a very significant amount of your income paid in bitcoin while at the same time have employees and providers that won't accept bitcoins. That's not how society works.
Second, and most important, even if you do wire transfers in batch you don't need to wait for that to convert your bitcoins into euros at the exchange. Exchanges let you hold your money in whatever currency you want and this won't be affected by other currencies change in price. So, as I said, you can convert your bitcoins into euros instantly as soon as the customer pays even if you wait a month to do the wire. And if bitcoin goes up or down you are still holding your money in euros.

And then you can easily dismiss secure methods of generating private keys as "unprovable to be safe" in a pro-solipsism manner. As if we couldn't say that that method is even slightly better than writing your private key in reddit cause we are "not even able to assign a probability" to it. What, not even by comparison?

They can lunch a million rogue nodes and make it slightly harder for honest nodes to find each other, but that's not that big of a deal. We will still find each other. The important thing is that no one wants to buy S2X coins.

For now bitcoin is not a good technology for small transactions, it's just a very good store of value (because of it's censorship resistance, trustless, secureness, etc. and because it's price keeps going up as more and more people want to use it as a store of value).
Gold is used as a store of value too, never for small transactions, and has great value.
Seems like we'll have to wait for the development of the lightning network and other scaling solutions before using it again for small instant payments.
It can still be used for not-so-small online payments that don't require instant confirmation though. That's nice.

You are mostly correct, and even Satoshi Nakamoto suggested that full nodes probable need some type of incentive.
If you find a way for full nodes to prove that they are indeed full nodes and that they are indeed verifying the transactions of each block you will be doing a pretty revolutionary development for bitcoin.
Unfortunately, nodes can't prove their work in the same way that miners can.
Also, running a node is really cheap so the incentive should be extremely low otherwise someone could fire up 100,000 nodes on the cloud and claim rewards.

Electrum is fine only if you use their cold storage functionality and sign your transactions offline. But given the nooby questions you are asking and your apparent lack of ability to google this information I wouldn't do it that way.
Use a hardware wallet. Also, if you have your money sitting at an exchange, as you apparently do, please use double factor authentication using google authenticator for your mail and for your exchange account.
The 25 of october the Bitcoin Gold fork will happen, but those coins won't be of any value. Then, the 17 of november the famous S2X fork will happen. So you want to transfer your coins from Gemini to your own control before the ~15 of November.

I think you just have a fundamental misunderstanding on how exchanging money works, how supply and demand sets it price, etc. But to answer your specific question:




If you tell the exchange on february 2nd to grab the 0.5btc you just received and change it to euros, the exchange will at that exact time find someone that wants to buy 0.5btc and give the 0.5btc to him, thereby holding the respective euros (this is still on february 2nd).
Then, when on march 2nd you want to withdraw the euros, the exchange was holding them in euros all along since february 2nd as that was when you received your bitcoins and told them to change the bitcoins to euros.
This doesn't remove all possible risks but risks don't come from the fact that you are holding euros or bitcoins at the exchange for an extended period of time instead of withdrawing them immediately.

As I said miners and developers can mine and develop whatever blockchain they want; it doesn't matter. The coin that will be used and have value will be the one that users use and thereby give value.
Miners and developers can mine and develop whatever chain they want and that will not trump the fact that *users* are the deciders on which coin is *used*. Also, the fact that your account is 1 week old and you are so stubborn in missing the point makes me think you are a puppet account.

What do you mean that it takes time for the payment channel to conclude?
The exchange will trade your bitcoins you just received for euros with another user the same minute that you tell them to convert the bitcoins you just received to euros. They have thousands of users trading all the time and the price of BTC is set according to supply and demand so that they roughly have the same amount of BTC sold as BTC bought at any given day.

I don't see why they would be strictly necessary. In my opinion inflation economics became popular because is a good excuse for governments to print and steal money.
Other economists see it like this: take a factory for example. It has an initial investment for it's fixed capital (like buying a truck, some machinery, etc) and for it's working capital (things they have to pay every production cycle, like raw materials, etc.). The fabric then produces some value and sells it to cover the working capital costs and some more. Now the next production cycle comes around but now all the working capital costs are less (raw materials cost less for this next cycle cost less, etc). They can buy more working capital and grow. It's when there is high inflation that they can't afford the costs of new working capital and neither grow nor invest, not the other way around.

News flash for you... users reign supreme. Miners will mine whatever coin is more profitable or has higher potential, and that's decided by which coin users buy and use, or will buy and use. But yea if a miner wants to grab all his resources and mine a coin with a minority user-base they can do that all they want. Won't change the fact that which blockchain has the higher value will be decided by users.
On the same logic, developers can develop whichever blockchain protocol they want. Hell, they can conspire with miners if they want for all I care, and try to make something that benefits them. Still, the blockchain that will have value will be the one used by users.
Users, not miners, not developers, not exchanges, are and will be the deciders. Someone opposing a User Activated Soft Fork that was already successful will belong to the looser side of history.
For as long as users sympathize with the decisions Core makes, they will be in charge of the design. But only for as long as that.

You still need to store your seed somewhere and if someone gets to see it u lose all your money. Like what if your house gets robbed.
Also, when you have a million dollars at a bank it's impossible for a mafia boss or a criminal to force you to give him your money cause there are things like a daily limit of how much money you can widthraw and because wire transfers can only be done to a verified person and because banks will cover you if they fuck up. But nothing prevents someone to put a gun to your head and say tell me your seed or put the hardware wallet into your pc and transfer me a million fucking dollars in less than 30 seconds.
And that's without even mentioning that you have to trust in the manufacturer of the hardware wallet. What of they get hacked and the hacker pushes a malicious update into your wallet?

10 million a day is 3% inflation per year and that's decreasing every 4 years. Bitcoin is growing way faster than 3% per year.
You keep repeating that most investors must lose money. But this is not true. As you said, as long as there is someone to buy at the price you bought or more you won't lose money.
And that is what exchanges do, they buy your coins. Since the price of bitcoin is set according to supply and demand so that roughly the same amount of coins are sold as the amount bought each day, as long as people keep wanting bitcoins no one will lose money. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:53:31
Yes u are right investors put more money in than they get directly out. Idk why I got confused and though we were saying the contrary.
I think the underlying problem is that you can't possibly see bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin may very well be a pyramid scheme in some senses. It will transition to a currency and a store of value. So at some point bitcoin won't be a better investment than, say, gold. You can get value from bitcoins by trading them for houses and other types of value without making them drop in price, like one does with currencies. 
The things that you claim that **must** happen may not happen. **That's the key point. **
There are too many people that don't trust banks and government and they may very well transition to decentralized systems of transaction and store of value like bitcoin. That's the vision. If they do, and bitcoin starts being used as a currency (which to some extent it already is used like that, and it may keep growing as lightning network and other scaling technologies are introduced), investors and later adopters will not lose money by adopting it. Bitcoin "investors" may very well always keep growing, for generations, as humans produce value by other means and "put it" in bitcoins as a way of currency or as a way of storing value. 
MtGox and exchanges are practically acting as banks and yes they have the problems that banks have, which is that they can go bakrupt, and in the case of MtGox government wasn't going to provide money out of tax payers like they do with other banks. This is not bitcoin's fault.
Even if you replace correctly using cold storage for just using cold storage as they use it, we still don't have stories about people losing their money from cold storage as we have from banks and governments stealing people's money.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:21:57
Aren't these peaks in the mempool caused by miners switching to mine bitcoin cash for a few hours cause it gets more profitable, making blocks in the real bitcoin come at a slower rate? 
Can you please compare your photo with a graph of the total hashrate drops that are constantly happening? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:02:08
That's correct. And as long as you don't move your coins no one can do a replay attack against you. Just stop buying/selling/moving coins a few days before the hard fork. After the hard fork is done, search for instructions on how to split your coins in both blockchains safely so you have a different address and private key for each blockchain and no one can do a replay attack against you.
That having been said, even if you do unsafe transactions vulnerable to replay attack it shouldn't be possible for you to lose coins you already have UNLESS you try to send them to an address of which the private key you don't hold (like when trying to buy something using bitcoins). In that case you might lose your coins on the other blockchain if you haven't yet split your coins into different addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:54:46
This isn't rules of tactics. This is freedom. User-majority usage does and will always decide which coin has the higher value and which coin they want to call what. Neither core, nor miners, nor local exchanges can change that fact.

Yes your transaction needs to be added into a mined block and miners won't add it if it has a low fee and they have better transactions to add. Unconfirmed transactions are stored in the mempool so as long as the mempool isn't empty they might have better transactions to confirm.

You are confusing miner work power with nodes. If all nodes are consolidated in centralized big farms then they can not only reject transactions but change any of the protocol's rules. Which means they can do anything including making fraudulent transactions. They can say the blockchain is something when in reality they are handling a different blockchain full of fraud. They can do anything.
Obviously, no user would wanna be part of such a centralized transaction system, and that's why SegWit2x will not succeed.

@_date: 2017-10-03 21:40:19
So say you wanna send 0.5 bitcoins on the S2X blockchain. You sign the transaction with your private key (this doesn't reveal your private key) and then you broadcast the transaction to the network.
After doing that, someone else can re-broadcast that very same transaction using the same signature you already made public to transact the same amount of coins into the same address but on the Core/S1X blockchain.
That's what a replay attack is. He can also delay your transaction if he controls enough nodes by confusing the already confused network. He uses your signature that you made public to replay the transaction in a different blockchain.
He can't send your coins to a different address than the one you chose in your transaction because your signature is cryptographically linked to the inputs and outputs of the transaction you made, and he for sure can't know the private key of this address you've chosen (as long as that address is yours and only yours, which is the case in your question). The only thing he can do is replay the same transaction. That's all he can do.
So, to recap, he can do a replay attack and he will move coins on a blockchain you haven't originally intended to move. If you use 2 different wallets for each blockchain and one of the wallets doesn't have the privatekey of the address you are sending to it will show as if you lost the money, but you need only to import your private key to this wallet to "recover" this "lost" money. The hacker can't get your money, just inconvenience you.

You can't steal my private keys even if I were to give you physical access to my house and the password of my computer. And you most certainly won't be able to get them through the internet alone even if I gave you the passwords to all my emails. This is despite the fact that I generated my private keys for free, using hardware I already own for other purposes. You can't say such thing about gold.
If a private key was done offline correctly, it can't be stolen as easily as gold. Gold has been confiscated by governments rather easily. It has been stolen from houses just like diamonds. And putting it at a bank's vault requires to pay fees, and it can still be confiscated. 
Yes with transactions I mean the ledger and the consensus rules that secure bitcoin. Those will only change if the consensus changes, which in turn will only change if "the people" start accepting different blocks. Indeed, a transaction system of the people, by the people and for the people. You can't transfer gold like that and be sure that it won't be censored, stolen or confiscated. But the bitcoin protocol is *trustless*.
Netflix and Uber virtual assets are not about patents and trademarks. Anyone could try to offer a similar service. Netflix even gives for free a ton of open source software that they develop for anyone to use. But they have infrastructure built around them, just like bitcoin has infrastructure with the miners, exchanges and all the businesses that exist around bitcoin. 
You are stuck in thinking that things need to have governments and physicality to be valuable and you can't see the vision of a trustless, secure, easily transferable store of value.

Yes, you can keep your coins in a bitcoin core wallet (whichever version you like). Don't make any transactions immediately after the hard fork so you are not a victim of a replay attack.
Then, with the private keys of your public addresses you can widthraw both your bitcoin coins and your S2X coins.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:04:54
I would think that they need to give me both my S1X coins and my S2X coins if they have value.
I'm pretty sure the 2 only exchanges I can access in my country at a fair rate don't have anything written on their policies or contracts on what to do in case a hard fork happens, so if they don't give me both S1X and S2X coins I would expect them to at least give me the coins that are in the protocol I initially invested in. I think that's pretty fucking obvious.
I mean, it really is like if I gave them dollars and they promised I can withdraw my dollars at any time but then when I want to withdraw they are like "Hey we don't like the united states, we like Europe. Imagine what would happen **if Euro prevails and Dollars are effectively abandoned, am I obliged to follow Dollars**? I know that doesn't happen yet, but I will go ahead right now and change all your dollars to Euros" (bold added to show the analogy to your bolded statement)

Lightning network is supposed to let you cash out in euro instantly, I don't understand your fear.
Your client (I mean the person buying what you sell) can open a lightning channel that is connected to your exchange (either directly or through nodes) and just send bitcoins instantly to your exchange with 0 fees. The exchange can then convert it to euros and give it to you.
So, in other words, you will give your buyer one of your bitcoins addresses that your exchange made available to you. Your buyer will send bitcoins to that address and these bitcoins will instantly be credited to that address. You can then instantly convert it to euros as these bitcoins will already be at the exchange under your name. Then you can do a wire transfer to withdraw euros.

I think we can agree on that if the exchange has a policy on what will happen in a hard fork, then that is what should happen. There is no legal argument anyone can make against that. But continuing with the exchanges I'm dealing with:
If the protocol I invested in is completely abandoned and there is no policy on the exchange that says that they are obliged to give me money from other protocols, I can cry all I want, but if they don't want to give me the coin from the other protocol I don't think law could force them to.
But it's different when it's the protocol I've invested in with their promise of me being allowed to withdraw at any time. If they suddenly say "we won't give you the coins in the protocol you originally bought, but in this other protocol" then I do think that's fraud and scam.

As I said you keep repeating that bitcoin will definetly come to zero and everyone will lose everything they invested but as I pointed out the crash of bitcoin could happen several generations down the road when dollars are already not worth anything.
The sum of all money that people have invested in bitcoins cannot exceed the money that people has taken out, because for people to take out money from bitcoins they have to have someone else invest that amount, as you said before.
I live in Argentina we had banks retain all our money in something called *corralito*, so no I don't think banks are safer. We have to bail them out every time they fuck up with hundreds of billions of dollars. 
That is a few *centuries* of the 10 million usd per day you keep citing considering the last 700 billion bailout. They will keep fucking up.
Between hardware wallets and correctly done cold storage you can have extremely high security we know that from the fact that there aren't stories about people correctly using hardware wallets and cold storage and losing large chunks of their money. On the other hand there are millions of stories of banks taking the people's money.
You keep repeating that we can't *calculate the probability* but that applies too to the possibility of banks just burning all the money in their vaults with literal fire, declaring bunkrupt and committing suicide. It probably won't happen even though we can't calculate the probability of it.
You say that we don't have a history to provide empirical estimates but that is not true. We have 8 years of bitcoin being around and we will have more history in the future. You may lack the vision of how bitcoin will be accepted as more secure than banks... *just wait*. Once we have more history, easier methods to secure bitcoins, and once banks need another bailout this time in the trillion dollar figure bitcoin will skyrocket.

You need to follow the proper steps but they don't involve using a fresh computer and a CD. You can use an old USB pendrive with at least 8GB of memory that you probably have. You download ubuntu from the official website and use a program called RUFUS to make the pendrive a bootable Ubuntu and also put the bitaddress script from their offical github repository in the pendrive to use them inside the offline ubuntu. All this 3 programs (ubuntu, rufus and the bitaddress script) are open source and checked by hundreds if not thousands of persons. You disconnect the computer from the internet, boot this fresh Ubuntu from the pendrive, generate wallet, write it down.
you can check this link for example and complement it with other tutorials if you are still unsure. 
You can even remove the pendrive and disconnect all your hard drives before generating your private key (you need to boot ubuntu with the special "toram" command for this, google it if you want), so that there are not possible storages were a malware could save your private key. With the internet disconnected and all storages disconnected there is no way for malware to keep your private key after you turn off the computer.
But you don't even need to disconnect all the storage because there hasn't yet been a case of a malware being able to transfer from windows to a live ubuntu and execute itself on the live ubuntu on it's own. So unless your ubuntu is tampered (which there is no case of ubuntu being tampered if downloaded from the official website and burned with RUFUS from it's official website) you are fine.

Gold was being mined by the tons in it's early history just like bitcoin. Bitcoin will stop generating new coins in a few decades just like gold.
The only way for someone to lose money by investing in gold is if suddenly people stop wanting to buy gold, but we know from history that this is not happening to gold. As long as more and more people want to buy bitcoins it's price will keep rising and no one has to lose money at all. 
The only way for holders to lose money in bitcoin or gold is if people stops accepting it as a store of value but this is not a "crazy lottery" in gold cause we know it's history.
And if people have confidence that bitcoin will keep rising in value as more and more people want to use it as a store of value then they stand only to gain money - all of them

I don't know if they have a plan, but all hardware wallets allow you to extract your private keys as far as I know (otherwise losing the hardware would mean losing your money. They give you a seed to store separately from the hardware and that seed you can later use to generate all your private keys offline). You might need to generate/extract them and use a different wallet/software to spend coins in the blockchain they don't support (in case they decide to not support one of the blockchains)
Also remember that there will be no replay protection so you shouldn't send coins to addresses you don't own during the hard fork. Just do whatever you want to do now and then a few days before the hard fork stop making any transactions. Then a few days after the hard fork search how to safely split your coins in each blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:20:31
No because the hard fork hasn't been activated yet. When you spend them now the transaction will be added into this single unique blockchain that both 2x nodes and 1x nodes have right now.
The problem will be after the hard fork, when doing a transaction to the 1x blockchain will allow a hacker to broadcast the same transaction into the 2x blockchain/network, thereby stealing your coins in the 2x network.

OK sounds like a good explanation. Don't put more than you can lose though. That having been said, I am extremely confident that bitcoin will keep going up. If you are going to put a significant amount of money make sure that is is SECURED. Use Google authenticator to activate double factor authentication for your mail account and for any exchange account you use to buy bitcoins.
If you are going to be your own bank (as opposed to just leave your bitcoins at an exchange) make sure that you use either offline wallets and sign transactions offline or just buy a hardware wallet which are very secure. People lose their money from time to time for not taking this security measures.
Also, I think in most countries bitcoin is considered an asset and most exchange have Know Your Customer laws. So hiding from the govt the fact that you have bitcoins might be tricky.

They are easier to secure (using cold storage instead of a physical expensive vault) and easier to transfer over long distances than gold, for starters. Bitcoins are also harder to fake, while you might trick people into buying fake gold or fake paper money.

Aff your comment is very wrong in several levels man.


First of all a private key is a 30+ characters long string which usually you don't type with your keyboard, you copy-paste it or, more often, you let a client wallet handle it. You can still get your keys stolen by a trojan or other malware that steals your data, but not just by a keylogger.
If you are worried that your PC is compromised you can always sign your transactions offline through a liveCD-style ubuntu, but that's a more advance method.
 &gt; can't i create the same address under the 2nd chain[?]
Do you udnerstand how addresses work? An address is derived from a private key. If you know/have the private key of an address in one chain then you know the private key for the other chain. It's the same private key. There is no creating or destroying. There is just holding the private key of a certain address.
No matter what wallet you use (Electrum, Bitcoin Core, whatever) these wallets hold and know the private keys of the addresses where you have coins. So, after the split, you will still have this private key that applies to both chains.
Let's give another example, say after the hard fork you go to the S1X chain and send coins from address A to address B. Let's say that you know/hold the private keys of both addresses (meaning you own those addresses). Then an attacker can re-broadcast this transaction on chain S2X, making the coins that were in address A go to address B on this other chain too. But you are the only one who knows the private key of address B so you are fine.


What? Why would you be sending your coins from wallet to wallet before the fork? Just let them sit.


This is weirdly worded but correct. If you copy the wallet to a S2X chain-compatible client you will be copying your private keys to it. This will allow you to spend your coins in the S2X but you would still be vulnerable to replay attacks.


Send it back to Electrum? From where? what? why? and this prevents a replay attack? If you are going to use Electrum you can just have them from the start and use Electrum as your sole client as it supports multiple blockchains in the same client, which I've just learn. You would just have to follow their tutorial 


Yes. Let's try again. Prior to the fork your coins are sitting in some address(es) and you have their private keys. After the fork, the coins will still be sitting in these address(es) in both blockchains. Up to here it should be pretty clear.
So at this point if you do normal transactions anywhere you will be vulnerable to replay attacks, which have the consequences that I already stated. It doesn't matter if you do the transaction in the S2X fork or in the S1X fork you will be vulnerable. Sending from Core to Electrum or from a S2X client to Electrum provides no benefit.
So now the question is, knowing that we have access to our coins in both blockchains on the same address, how do we split them so we are safe from replay attacks. And for that you do what LukeJr said, a safe transaction that can't be re-broadcasted so your coins on one chain are on a different address than the coins on the other chain. Then you are immune to broadcasts.
I hope I haven't confused you more. You just need to understand how things work in the inside. It's all about addresses and their private keys. Sending from a anddress held at a Core client to an address held at an Electrum wallet doesn't make anything. Although sending your coins to Electrum and having them from before the soft fork will allow you to forget about everything else as they will support both chains; just follow their tutorial on how to split them after the hard fork.

I think leaving your money at an exchange (or distribute it in a few exchanges) using two-factor authentication is safer than using a hot android or iOS wallet or putting your BIP39 password into a device connected to the internet though...

Do people have any reason to believe this wasn't true? Considering it came from his real mail accounts I would think they are likely to be true no?
He never signed his messages

If bitcoin loses 90% of it's hashpower transactions will take 10 times longer to confirm, so you will need to pay higher fees if you want fast confirmation, yes.
As with bitcoin cash, this hard fork will fuck up confirmation times for some short period of time. It won't affect too much the bitcoin price tho.
Also bitcoin has several other difficulty adjustment mechanisms beyond the 2016 blocks one.

If you are putting money worth hours of work into bitcoins then you shouldn't store your coins in a personal hot wallet (a hot wallet is a wallet that's connected to the internet and has access to all your coins). Mycellium is such a hot wallet.
The free, most secure way to store your coins is to use a paper wallet or cold storage, which means that the unencrypted private keys of your bitcoins remain OFFLINE.
Leaving instead your bitcoins at GDAX is fairly secure if you have two-factor authentication activated, but you risk that if they don't support one of the blockchains on one of the forks you won't be able to access your money after the fork (unlikely. they are probably going to support both chains, but might take a while)

THIS IS A SCAM. This user has been a redditor for 2 days. PayPal transactions are REVERSIBLE while bitcoin is not. He will send you the money, you will send the bitcoins and he will just reverse his paypal pay. You can't withdraw PayPal transactions after a certain time has passed, so it will just get reversed as soon as you send your bitcoins.
Also transacting bitcoins through PayPal is against their rules.

But a million nodes doesn't change anything so you should start looking for a different ace.
In any event I don't think they are crazy. They can have several reasons to want to keep pressuring for a block size change, like the fact that they actually believe in it and want to pressure for as long as possible... But this doesn't mean that they will run their businesses at a loss. Remember that being in favor of a change isn't the same as having the will to burn your business for it. So this might explain why they are not backing out even though they are not crazy and don't have an ace. 
If they really had an ace it won't be a few cloud nodes. If they really had an ace we wouldn't be seeing so many exchanges and mining pools backing away from the agreement a month before the hard fork.

I don't understand, what extra information did you give to them by calling them? Your english is kinda bad, it's hard to understand you.
What did you use to try to log in? the telephone? did they give you a fake website to put your information?
You might want to try to sue the phone number...

But your pastebin didn't come from Satoshi nakamoto real mail accounts that weren't spoofed nor hacked.

You can involve the police at that point or just get out of the country if they want to camp on you for days. The problem I'm talking about is the ability of a criminal - any criminal, not just a mafia - to get all your money in 30 secs

If hash rate drops in half wouldn't it take 20 minutes? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:13:27
yes, you just won't be able to help new nodes synchronize to the network if you are running in prune mode, but you will be able to reject dishonest transactions and also to broadcast new valid blocks to other nodes

If you do a low-fee transaction before the hard fork with a client incompatible with one of the future blockchains, and this transaction isn't confirmed when the hard fork happens, an attacker may replay your transaction in the other blockchain. If you don't own the address where you sent your coins you will lose those coins in the other blockchain too.
But I guess if you were spending bitcoins before the hard fork you weren't expecting to have them in any blockchain so it might not bother you.

The value of bitcoin will not rise forever in the real sense of the word value, but, as governments keep printing dollars and dollars become less and less used, 1BTC could be worth 3 million dollars. It will require the dollar itself to be less valuable compared to, say, an apple or whatever.

We are against contentious hard forks, doesn't matter where they come from. The fact that core is also against contentious hard forks doesn't mean that there is some hypocritical double standard going on.

@_date: 2017-10-03 21:56:46
Haha and also a period is a section of time, like "a period when government can no longer censor your money is coming". Actually that will be forever so it's not a period but you get my point
