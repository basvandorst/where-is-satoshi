Got in in December for the money. 
Just after I got in, the huge gains stopped and I had to decide what to do with my coins.
So I educated myself and got fascinated by the technology and its implications.
Now I'm a true believer in the tech. I wouldn't mind to make some money with it as well, though.

One of the reasons I want Bitcoin to succeed: It shifts monetary power to a different kind of people. As you can clearly see here. Also in the comments.
It's a huge social experiment. Let's change the world!

Possible, but they don't have an influence on the price, because they don't participate in the market.
Except for the fact, that they increase the scarcity of the coins. But maybe only a little bit.

Excellent news!
I've worked with the stripe-api. It's the easiest to use payment api I've ever worked with.
Exactly what Bitcoin/Lightning needs.
The future is bright for Bitcoin.
Edit: Just had a glance at the api reference. Looking good! Simple and straightforward, exactly how an API should look like.

@_date: 2018-01-25 21:11:27
I'm more interested in what happens *after* the markets close. 
If the price rises sharply, it has been manipulated down before (or everybody was manipulated into believing so), because they shorted Bitcoin.
If it drops sharply, the other way around.
If it stays roughly the same, there was no manipulation...

Probably, but at least you can discuss those ideas and concepts. 
A crypto will only be successful in the long run if the technology is capable enough. 
Even if your (or my) answer to these questions is speculation, these are the questions you should ask yourself. Otherwise you'd be only following a cult.

That is exactly that 'cult' mentality we need to get away from.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:25:50
I fully agree with you. I've been here for about two weeks. Took me about a week to get to terms with it, read up on the technologies and be able to make up my own mind.
Now I can say, I enjoy both subs for what they are.
The truth is, the final call is still out. I prefer the "real" bitcoin, but I understand the reasons behind the creation of bitcoin cash.
But yes, for newcomers who don't want to think for themselves, it can be hard. Especially if they only follow one of the both subs.
But: That's life.

Of course it's a bet. That's exactly what I said...
But it should be based on some basic understanding of the technology. 
I'd rather compare it with venture capitalists than with a casino when it comes to the odds.

Pretty much what I wrote about yesterday. Hello brother, we need more like you.

Different coins tackle different problems. Whether one coin is 10x better than another is largely based on personal preference.
I agree that there are better coins than bitcoin, but we might disagree which ones that would be.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:51:13
I've diversified into other coins (mainly Monero) in the past few days, because I expect a correction, which (I assume) won't hit Monero that hard.
I'm sure many people feel the same. 
So, no attack. Just psychology.

That would make about $22293 per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't need to achieve that. Bitcoin is just a protocol.
Other services can and will achieve that, using Bitcoin. Yes there's still work to be done, but if there's money to be made, the work will be done.
And it isn't about centralization. Bitcoin is decentralized. Period.
Other services might be centralized for a time, but competition will drive the decentralisation of those services.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:34:46

@_date: 2018-05-11 09:50:20
This is the bottom. 
Why do I know that? If I had my coins on an exchange I would panic sell now. 
Whenever I did that in the past, the price started to rise and I would lose coins.
Luckily I have transferred all the coins I had remaining on an exchange to my hardware wallet last week, so I can't act on impulse anymore.

It's only considered *broken* if an hourly candle closes above it.
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:46:58
Yes. 
Simply put: the Bitcoins are never on your computer (at least not with a wallet like electrum). They are stored on a global computer network. 
(not 100% accurate, but a good enough for your case. Actually there are no Bitcoins, it's just a history of all transaction... Bitcoins don't really exist)
So, you don't need to be online to receive bitcoins.

Not for long. Bullrun starts soon.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:12:43
I'm pretty relaxed right now. This will only change if we break through 7800. But I very much doubt that we will.
We might even bounce before and create a higher low. That would have to happen right about now...
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:58:22
Well, I'm not so sure about his timetable. It could rise a bit slower, but it'll start to rise round about now...
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:23:47
We're still in a kind of extended bear flag. We need to get above 9350 to break free of that.

Usually, I don't agree with you. But in this case: Yes, that's what we all signed up for. Free markets.

But I still trust, that it'll be able to handle it in the long run.

True. :-)
But I also have (h)opium. I really want this TA to be right:

Clarity in regulation, institutional money coming in (or not).
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:28:18
I doubt that it will get much lower. We're at the 400 day EMA, which was the barrier during the last two drops. We might overshoot a little, $6800 is being thrown around, and I find that possible.
But 6k? I highly doubt that.

Shorts getting closed *is* legit traction. Everything that moves the market is legit traction. That's how markets work...
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:49:03
I'll try to explain. Of course the market is always deciding. But there are situations when two trends collide. 
In this case it was a short term upward trend and a longer term downward trend. At those crossings you usually find extreme price actions.
Look at the image. I did make the post at the blue arrow. The price was in an uptrend and it was meeting an older downtrend. It could have decided to break through this downtrend. 
If that had happened, many traders would have jumped in, after the confirmation, to push the price even higher.
In this case the downtrend won, after the confirmation, many traders sold. Pushing the price further down.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:17:13
Are there other words in your vocabulary or is this the only one?

Great chance to buy the dip!
Don‘t say: I should have bought at $8300.
This is the double bottom. It’s going up now.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:07:43
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:22:24
I really don't know what to think of this rise. Sure, I'm always happy when the price goes up.
But it looks suspicious to me. 
A return of the Bart times?
Anyway, I hold and buy the dips. Everything will be fine in the long run...

If you read the statement, you'll see that you are mistaken.
They won't accept Bitcoin. You'll have to convert them to USD before (maybe with the help of their new exchange) and then can use those USD to pay for your coffee.
The payment system we're all hoping for would work the other way around: They'll accept the BTC and then convert to USD after they have accepted them, preferably via Lightning Network.

Bitcoin won't be an *investment* long before that. It will be a usable currency.
So, yes, people would still buy it. Not for gains, but to use it. I doubt, that it will ever reach $1m. But wouldn't it be nice?
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:27:01
I believe, we are at the bottom or very close to it. But nobody can be sure.

The whole "gold metaphor" is flawed in my opinion.

We’re in an ascending triangle. The price wants to go up. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:00:48
I generally agree with you, but it's a complicated topic.
Having a payment system with a public ledger has its advantages, too: Imagine a world where Bitcoin is everywhere, and all payments of all governments are in the public domain... Full accountability!
Privacy for the layperson is important, though. So the solution Bitcoin needs to find, will have to balance those two sides. Not an easy task, but I'm sure the devs are well aware of that.
In the meantime you can use Monero.

This is a good time to buy.
I just did. 
There's a new, flatter and more sustainable uptrend forming. Which happens to be the McAfee Dickline.
The price might fall down to 8760 for a very short time, but I believe that it will bounce back over the dickline very quickly.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:50:46
It’s above 8k.
8500 &gt; 8000

I tried a bit of trading last weekend with a small portion of my coins. After holding and watching the market for five months, I got bored and thought I know enough now. Lost quite a bit in two days running after short term trends. Made all the beginner mistakes.
I concluded that I‘m too stupid for this and transferred all my remaining coins to my hardware wallet.
Now I’m back to holding and buying the dips.
The technology is moving forward. It will be reflected in the price sooner or later.

@_date: 2018-05-18 20:16:51
Now we need a higher high. That would mean something like $8400 for a longer time and/or a peak above $8500.
And we need to break $8340 to break the downtrend.
That would be nice...

There will be a very hard resistance.

*In my opinion*, we just left or are about to leave the E wave of the corrective trend and are starting a new market cycle with Wave 1. 
There might be one more corrective subwave, but maybe not. Low volume is an indicator for it, though.
Look here at "Horizontal Triangles". The highest point is our "All time high".
On the 4h chart:

Actually "crypto-anarchism" started it all. Please don't attribute it to Bcash...
"Bitcoin is a currency generated and secured by peer-to-peer networked devices that maintain a communal record of all transactions within the system that can be used in a crypto-anarchic context. The idea behind bitcoin can be traced to The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto."

Why do you think that is? Because people have expectations for its future utility.
Now ask yourself where the value of gold originates. It's not just scarcity. It's history, too. Gold once *had* utility as a means of exchange, in daily business. You cannot just replace it with something else that is scarce and maybe more easy to exchange and expect people to value it in the same way.
No. Bitcoin will only have real value, if it achieves a status as a kind of currency. Like gold did before. 
I'm betting a lot of money that it *will*. I believe that it will.
But if it won't, then it won't have any value at all.

On the other hand, I don't believe that the correction will be drastic. The price seems to be gravitating around the "dickline". Would be fine with me...
If we manage to keep a higher low (higher than 8870) we'd still be in a general uptrend.
On the other hand, if we go up now to at least 9180, we'd have a higher high. That would be great!

The next hours are critical! (tm)
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:49:53
I think you're wrong.
I actually cashed out a few days ago, but that doesn't mean I don't believe in the technology. I just don't believe in the current price. I *do* believe that it will go up in the long run. But I don't know when it will be, and I don't know how low it will go before it turns around.
So yes, I'd recommend to cash out for now.
But the technology is evolving, Lightning Network is just in its infancy. Bitcoin has proven again and again that it's secure. PoW and transaction fees generate a decentralized system that is nearly indestructable. 
It won't go away. No matter how low the price falls. Because when miners go out of business, the hashrate falls, difficulty adjusts... And mining stays profitable for the remaining miners. It's an ingenious concept!
The priceaction sucks. Many people are losing money. That's bad. But Bitcoin will stay. And someday it will be successful.
Just not right away.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:35:04
Volume is good.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:06:17
When people stop mining, the hashrate goes down. When this happens, difficulty adjusts until there's a new equilibrium and mining is profitable again.
It's quite ingenious. It means, mining will be profitable at nearly every price... in the long run.

I never thought it'd come to this, but I just sold 2/3 of my coins. 1/3 to cash, 1/3 to tether as a hedge. I was simply too vulnerable and need some good night sleep.
I still believe in the technology, just not in the price, at least not in the short term.
Given my track record with financial decisions, this is very likely the bottom.

Honestly: This is hard to watch, but we will weather the storm...
@_date: 2018-06-10 14:06:28
Indeed. It's a stand-off. The market is very undecided and waits for a signal.
All these ups and downs we've been seeing recently are just noise, generated by highly leveraged trades. No real market movement. TA will fail here.

Indeed. It could go left. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:23:55
Nobody can tell you when the best time will be. The market is very unpredictable right now.
Personally, I expect it to go down very soon, below 7000. But that's just my personal view. It could also go only up from now on.
Educate yourself on the tech. If you are convinced that it'll succeed in the long run (as I am), get in. And hold your coins for a few years.
Here is a good source for education:
Best place to buy depends on your country. Generally these exchanges are to be recommended for people in Europe (also my personal view): 
It might take a few weeks for them to verify your identity. So better register now, if you want to buy soon.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:13:51
Can you feel it?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:08:24
On the right side it states: "Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to."
So I reported this.

@_date: 2018-03-20 11:45:48
Now understand it. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:22:48
Hahaha. Don't worry. I deeply believe you will profit in the long term, if you hold.
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:17:00
People are selling for lower prices.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:10:01
You thought wrong. There's a tax on your gains if you don't hold for at least a year. Trades between cryptos also count as taxable events.

@_date: 2018-03-27 18:50:58
Various creditcard providers and paypal. The apis all suck. Paypal less then the creditcard systems.
Hard to write software for and a lot of responsibility on your end to care for security.
I've had a short look at the APIs blockstream is releasing. Simple and easy. And elegant. Developers will find it very easy to write stuff with it. This will take off in no time.

@_date: 2018-03-30 18:21:23
Generally I agree with you. 
But it might be possible that the Bitcoin technology will work just fine economically with a value of $2000 per coin. Personally, for me, that would be very uncomfortable...
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:10:46
And my valuable time.

So far, it's the combined effort of 3 companies. I don't want to google them for you. Blockstream is the most prominent.

Good for you. I just had a few discussions with people who think they can get around it.
They're in for a rude awakening. The governments don't have everything in place ATM to track your trades, but they *are* registered. Give it a few years, and they have the means to analyze all your trades. 
Then it's payday...
In Germany they can get you for tax evasion 10 years after you did it.

Bitcoin has a very naughty set of economic incentives built in. 
The hope is, of course there's no guarantee, that *some* countries will want to profit from those. 
It could start with some developing countries. 
Their economies will benifit from the embrace of Bitcoin. Soon other countries don't want to be left behind...
Of course, this is all speculation. But the fact that Bitcoin made it this far, is reason to hope for more...

I'm also not convinced. This might change if we get above 8500 (or better 9000) for a longer period of time.
But I'm a holder anyway. I hold and will only buy more below 7000. Otherwise I have enough in my bags already.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:56:31
Lol! Do you always delete your previous comments after you changed your mind?

We are here. Quietly buying the dips.

**The** day.

The best time was 20 years ago.

I don't think so. It's sma, it doesn't react instantly.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:52:41
Breakout. Downwards...
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:40:49
Highly unlikely...
It would need to break through the SMA 100 in the 4 hour chart for that. That's a tough barrier.
Last time the price was above 9000 it didn't manage to break through either, the SMA100 was at around 9100-9000 back then, falling steeply. Now it's around 8800.
Look at the pink line:
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:26:40
I believe I'm a very special person around here, because I really don't have a fucking clue if it will go up or down from this moment on.
But it doesn't matter. I like the tech, so I hold.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:20:27
This. I don't want my trade history at my exchanges full of sells. 
I'm sure my government will get access to that someday, and then it would be tax armageddon.
Holding and buying the dips. And maybe cashing out a bit after 1 year, so it's tax free.

I can only talk about Germany, but yes: If I buy Bitcoins for $500 and sell them less than a year later for $1000, I would have to pay a tax on the $500 gain.
If I buy a TV from the $ I have left, I would have to pay VAT, which is usually included in the price in Germany.

In what time? I'd bet 0.01 bitcoin, it won't go down that far in the next 7 days. 
If it goes down that far, it has to stay there for at least 1 hour.
Which exchange should we base that bet on? Bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:10:51
If you hold for more than a year (also no trading between coins), your gains *are* tax free in Germany.

It seems so. They all must be incredibly rich by now.

Yes. You can also write an address on a letter without ever having been there. The letter will get to that address anyway.

You might have to take taxes into account, and all the bureaucracy that comes with buying and selling... 
Depends on your country.
And don't think you'll get around this. If your exchange did a KYC, all your trades can (and will) be traced back to you. Maybe not this year, but some day for certain...

Nobody can give you the correct answer, because nobody knows the future.
Learn about the tech. If you're convinced that it will be successful in the future, then it might be a good time to buy and hold.
If you only look to make some money, then it might not be enough to convince you to hold through the hard times...
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:49:24
... or buy.

While I don't agree with your tactics of constantly editing your posts or deleting them. I actually *do* agree with what you're saying here.
We're in a dangerous situation. We *could* breakout to the top. Some TA seems to support that. But I'm not convinced of it just yet. The markets have been very weird lately...

Look at all these moving averages converging. The breakout will be violent. I guess... Of course, I could be wrong. This market is weird sometimes...
This is the 1 minute chart.
(The yellow broken line is the EMA100 on the 4 hour chart, I drew a line for it, because I can't have it "live" on the 1 minute chart.)

@_date: 2018-03-28 19:27:42
I find this analogy ridiculous. 
Gold achieved its value for a variety of reasons. Not only because of its scarcity. 
It is beautiful, can be used for decoration, had utility as a currency for a long time, and is seen with sentimentality because of its strong history. Alone the word "gold" inspires strong feelings.
Bitcoin can't deliver that. Only if it becomes a strong currency, it will gain value. Then maybe one day, after a phase of strong utility, it might be valued for sentimal reasons and scarcity alone. When other digital currencies have surpassed it. 
But certainly not now.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:52:08
You're welcome.
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:08:27
Just a little longer... 
I'll buy more around 6500-7000...
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:15:14
Two different kinds of taxes. One for capital gain and one for consumption. It's been like this for a looong time. Long before Bitcoin even existed.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:18:51
Can you feel it?
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:51:50
me too 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:14:33
That's how I understand it. If I buy and hold (no trading) for more than a year, my gains are tax free.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:27:35
I'm calling it: 100k in 10 days
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:32:18
So far, we can't seem to keep it there. 
But there's still hope...
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:35:18
That's usually the reason for a price jump.

If you have fiat left to spend, I wouldn't wait. You won't have these prices in a few days...

I don't want to deal with the tax bureaucracy. I hold and buy the dips. No taxes involved.
I'm from Germany. When I hold for more than a year my gains are tax free.

Those are the outer rim territories.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:26:33
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:25:03
And Bitcoin was designed in a way, that if everyone wants to make money from it, it will succeed. Great, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:39:28
Can you feel it?
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:51:23
To be honest, I don't trust this uptrend. I'd love to trust it, I want the price to go up. I have no fiat left to invest. But I've seen something like this before.
It's called a bear flag. And I'm afraid, we have to weather one more crash before the price can really recover...
If you're thinking long term, it's a good price to get in anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:48:08

You keep your old private key and seed words? I don't want to switch (for now) because I'd have to use new seed words.

I understand what you're saying. I buy my Bitcoins with Euro, too. But from watching the charts I can say, the Euro barriers aren't that strong. Yes, there is *some* resistance (or support) at those levels, but usually not that much.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:16:21
That was quite the pump! /s
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:07:12
It's direct money transfer from buyer to seller. I can only buy from people within my country (Germany). There is no exchange where I can SEPA transfer money to an account in Germany. And my bank only allows for SEPA within Germany.
I could use Coinbase or Bitstamp with Creditcard, but the fees are too high.
So I'm stuck with that.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:16:14
You guys are really ripping it. I see a bright future ahead.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:25:47

I'm pretty confident that some very capable people are working on this *right now*. People who have some interest in Bitcoin becoming a usable currency, because if that happens, they all will be fucking rich.
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:34:39
Ledger Nano S *does* support Segwit. You maybe need to create a new wallet for that.
Anyway, you can always send Bitcoin from a segwit wallet to a non-segwit wallet. Shouldn't be a problem.

ooops. Here we go. Hopefully the last crash for now...
Not crashing enough. Still inside the bear flag...
Completion of the pattern would be around 6000.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:06:22
Well, that was underwhelming. A bit of a boost in volume, but not enough to push it through 8400.

I find him entertaining. I'm not daytrading, so he doesn't influence my decisions.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:58:42
If you look at my chart, it would already be very bad if we fall below ca. $6900.
That would mean, the old trendline was broken.
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:10:11
I've been glued to my laptop staring at the charts for the past few days. Whenever I looked away for a few minutes the price made a big jump.
So I decided: I won't look at the charts for the next days. I'm sure we will experience a bull run for the history books!
You can thank me later.

Pretty hard to unit test something that involves external APIs...
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:42:08
At some point we will *need* to break through or it's going to be very bad.
I suspect that we will crash at least one more time before we can do that.
But like everyone else, I'm just pulling that prediction out of my ass. This market is full of surprises.
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:31:52
All I have to say in this case: Everybody knows this already. Nothing new to see here.

I beg to differ. I've had a look at the LAPPs (yes the name is not perfect). And being a webdeveloper, I find those pretty awesome. Easy to work with, simple, elegant. It will take off in no time!

I've been following him for quite some time. He is very entertaining and I like how he can direct your attention to certain details.
But yes, recently he's been flipflopping. He doesn't know where the market will go. Nobody does. But his language doesn't reflect that...
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:52:33
Listen to this guy.
I like it when it goes down, so I can buy the dip. I like it when it goes up, because my portfolio rises in value.

Looks like the death cross will happen tomorrow...

It's more like coordinates on earth. They always existed. But only you know where yours are. And since there are so many of them, nobody else will every find yours.
It's not the best analogy. I'm sure someone else could come up with a better one...

A "bounce" looks different. I'm afraid it'll go further down.

I really liked this article, until it started attacks and comparisons with other cryptos. That's IMO not necessary. 
Just describe a layered system and its advantages, and ignore others, or you sound like a shill... sadly... because personally, I also like the layered approach for the same reasons mentioned in the article.

That's what the market is doing right now. People get impatient.

Bitfinex has higher limits, but you'll need to deposit at least $10000 before you can start trading.

Probably. But I'm watching the live trades and there is a lot of demand and a lot of volume. It could break through.

Here for you: 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:41:44
I think it will go down unless it goes up.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:46:02
Onwards and upwards
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:16:52
I'll add another possible reason: 
My neighbors black cat walked under a ladder this morning. Whenever he does that, Bitcoin is falling.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:11:19

Amidst all the panic, let's not forget: The longterm upwards trend hasn't been broken. It's proving to be a very strong support.
Having said this, the downtrend is also very strong.
In a few days, we'll see the final battle. The market has to decide then.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:14:40
In what order?
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:12:09

Free markets are "price finding maschines". 
The market hasn't found Bitcoins true price, yet. Once that happened, the volatility will smooth out.
We are at the very early stages of a global revolution, it's a bit bumpy here.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:59:16
Bitfinex has the most volume and is usually (not always) leading. You can watch it on tradingview.com, along with gdax and others...
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:59:45
ATM my portfolio (BTC and XMR) is down about 1,25% from initial fiat costs. It was nearly 50% at some points.
I hodled and bought the dips. It was nerve-wrecking. Hopefully soon I'll be able to sleep better...
Edit: Now it's only down 0,36%. Feels good.
+0,05% Liftoff!
aaaaand it's gone.
Back to -2,5%...
I guess I'll have to wait a little longer for a good night sleep. Hahaha!
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:44:28
It WILL be simplified. This is just the beginning, the protocol. 
http (on top of TCP/IP) by itself would also be too complicated for end users. Nobody wants to type in http commands by hand. That's what browsers do. In this case: That's what wallets will do.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:17:47

@_date: 2018-03-29 05:29:35
I believe it'll be around $6900. Maybe even higher.
Too many people missed the last dip to 6000. They don't want to miss their opportunity to buy cheap coins again, so they won't let it fall to the previous low.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:38:53
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:46:14
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:16:15
And so it begins...
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:03:30
We holders keep holding. We just aren't so outspoken about it in times like these...
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:52:24
Sure. 
I'm happy either way. 
If it goes down, I'll buy more.
If it goes up, I'm happy for the coins I already hold.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:04:24
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:39:41


Yes. It'll take some time. But they have the right priorities: Get it to work on the protocol layer before putting too much effort on fancy GUI clients.
Only mistake was: They opened it for mainnet too early. I hope that won't bite them, when they have to break backward compatibility for important upgrades.
The timing is a bit unfortunate. During this crash many people want to see breathtaking advances right now so they don't lose faith. But it'll just take a little longer.

@_date: 2018-03-22 14:56:53
Depends on your timeframe. If the price pumps now, the last 5 hours have been a bear trap.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:17:52
One post would have been enough.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:21:43
I'm just glad, I'm not a daytrader. So I can enjoy those pumps without fear.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:39:06
For decisions like this I wouldn't ask reddit. 
But since you're asking: *If* you decide to buy, don't invest all at once. You *could* get lucky and it's only going up from here. But it's more likely that it will go up and down pretty wildly for the next few months. Buy a little bit at every dip and you *might* be better off in the long run.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:16:03
It will be.
First build a rocksolid baselayer. Only then build an easy to use interface on top of it. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:08:11
It's always "before the crash".
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:30:51

Since when does Easter last for 3 months?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:36:59
We still need to shakeout some weak hands. Once there's nobody left willing to sell for this price, Bitcoin will rise quickly... *hopefully*...
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:51:56
Thanks. It's an interesting presentation.
And I needed that.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:35:39
To be honest: nobody can give you solid advice in this matter. 
- It might be that the dip is over the moment you sold and you have to buy back later at a higher price.
- It might be that you decide not to sell, because of the previous possibility, but the price continues to drop.
Personally, I had my target at around 6800. I bought some more. But that might have been a mistake.
This is, why I had my target there:
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:26:23
You're looking at arbitrage trading bots. No conspiracy there...
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:42:09

GDAX is a bad indicator. Try Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:41:07
I did. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:37:56
Personally, I find it quite upsetting. I do it. But I can't say per se that I *love* it...
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:23:20
Just remember: For everyone who is selling at this price, there's someone who happily buys.

@_date: 2018-02-08 18:06:27


Until it doesn't.
I got in near the ATH. Bought more during many dips, because I educated myself about the technology, and am convinced that it's awesome.
But right now I'm still down about 30% from all my investments. And personally I'm not 100% sure that I will get into the green ever again.
So, I don't *love* HODLing. I just do it, because I see no other way.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:51:57
I'm pretty much in the same situation. 
The market needs to shake some weak hands off. After they're gone the price will rise again. But slowly.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:39:51
This very bearish TA was just posted. I don't agree with it, but he has so many followers (more than 35.000) that I think we will see a huge drop in price just about now...
Edit: I guess he is less of an influencer than I though. Just a small bump. Good.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:22:30
I wonder if I also get to the frontpage, if I share a twitter post which links to *this* twitter post which links to the article.

Being a programmer myself, I can relate. Everybody makes mistakes. I kind of feel sorry for them.
Having said this: Whenever financial transactions are involved, when it is about money going from one party to another, you better do not fuck up. Or your customers are gone. For a good reason.
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:53:30

@_date: 2018-02-03 19:28:58
I thought so, too, at first. Now I'm not so sure. We'll see soon enough.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:06:23
Yep. That's it. I've reached my fiat limit. Can't buy anymore dips. Now it's up to you.

Ok. Can we please rally to 10k now? So I get to my "break even" point. 
Or dump below 7000, so I can buy some more.
But this is "nowhere land". Frustrating...

I believe in the technology. Yes, I know, many people here (the reddit Cryptocurrency community) won't agree with me.
TumbleBit is coming, so is Rootstock.
Lightning Network is awesome. I'm testing a LN Wallet (Zap) on testnet. It's still a bit buggy, but the transactions are superfast. Less than a second!
The development and adoption will take a little time, but when it's here, many altcoins will lose their right to exist.
The miner network is big, secure and battle hardened.
LN will allow atomic swaps. So it will be possible to use multiple currencies on it, but with Bitcoin being the first and most secure, people will want to transfer most of their funds to it for safe storage.
The developer community is huge, and they're in it for more than just money.
I see a bright future for the usability and adoption of Bitcoin, and in turn for its price.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:24:02
I just bought some more. It *will* recover.

You'll get your answer in a few days. We are closing in to a very important crossroad.
From there it will either rebounce, or it will crash down terribly.
Personally, I bet my money on a rebounce. But I could be wrong...

@_date: 2018-03-24 20:35:31
I wish for nothing. If it goes down, I'm happy to buy the dip. If it goes up, I'm happy for the coins I already own...
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:51:24
So true for me. I started to buy Bitcoin in December. A little more near ATH. Then more and more on the way down, to bring my average costs down.
Now my "break even point" is around 10800. So right now my portfolio is switching between red and green all the time.
I believe I'm not alone, that's why we see so many swings. As soon as impatient people see that they can get out without a loss, they sell.
I was tempted too many times to count...
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:28:10

Depends on adoption and scarcity. I believe it will go up. 
But not with the ridiculous "it's like gold" analogy. Only if it delivers real world utility.
And this is being worked on right as I write this. Will it be enough? I don't know. But I'm betting on it.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:25:09
Prepare your fiat cannons!
Buy signal is around 6600. Maybe a little above that, so you don't miss the opportunity.

The 200 day moving average is at $9878 right now, which is by funny accident also my personal break even point...
From the moment we break that and stay above, it's only Unicorns and Rainbows.
Until then, I'm just cautiously optimistic.
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:35:13
I'd say, that's exactly how Bitcoin was meant to be. Completely around the system, no fiat involved. 
Just do it.
I believe, the laws are not up to the task to deal with this kind of situation, yet. So I wouldn't worry. Even if you would get into trouble, it would be a very interesting lawsuit...
I mean: What are you doing? You buy some Bitcoin and instantly exchange them for goods. No problem here. The problems arise, when you wait 2 months, they gain 100% in value and then you exchange them for goods. Then you'd have to pay capital gains tax on the increased value.
Even then, it's a gray area, because you don't sell Bitcoin for fiat, but exchange them for goods.
This is a prime example of a usecase, that will keep courts and lawmakers busy in the coming years...
The danger you are personally in depends highly on the size of the transactions. If you want to buy a cellphone for Bitcoin, nobody will care. If you want to buy a multimillion dollar villa. People might suspect money laundering...
Edit: I have to add: I am not a lawyer.

Just remember: Time in the market beats timing the market.
Think long term. If you act short term, you might make a lot of money, but it's more likely that you will get rekt.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:00:56
It is. 
In the past three months I reduced my avg. costs from $15000 to $10000 by buying the dips.
That's still a loss of over 30%. It hurts.
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:58:33
Why did you fuck up? You made a profit.
Other than that: Nobody can predict the price. Buy small chunks. If it goes down after your first buy: buy a lttle more. If it goes up: wait a little. Cost average. And hold long time.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:19:05

There's still hope for you. If this guy is right, it will go up a little. And then drop further down. If you're not actively trading, but just waiting for a dip, it's worth a look. And maybe worth a wait.
This guy predicts an even lower dip:

"organic" is such a misused word around here. 
Sometimes the value fluctuates in extremes, because there are lots of bots involved and they all listen to the same indicators.
That is not necessarily a bad thing. It's just the way it is.

There's quite a bit of volume right now (Bitfinex). Which leads me to believe, whenever one party runs out of steam (bulls or bears) the resulting jump in price will be *big*.

Then you have to send them from your wallet to the wallet of an exchange. This transaction will be on the blockchain.
If they are already on an exchange, they're not in *your wallet*. They are in the wallet of your exchange, and even if you sell them they will most likely not be transferred to another wallet. This won't be recorded on the blockchain.

You don't understand how free markets work. The price won't go up just because you need it to.
Actually, this will put pressure on the price, because miners will have to sell a larger chunk of their mined coins in order to cover the running costs...

I doubt that. There will be lots of crashes in the future. They will only stop when really big players enter the market who have an interest in stable prices.
I believe that this will happen someday. But not anytime soon.

Due to popular demand we have decided to extend the sale for a very short time. 
The happiness of our customers is of utmost importance to us. So we want to give everyone, who might have missed out on this "once in a lifetime" opportunity, the chance to take advantage of these incredibly low prices.
But be quick! This sale ends very soon!

Yes, I used the wrong term. Big deal. You'll understand what I meant.
Edit: Actually, I didn't use the wrong term.
"Thus, opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost."
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:37:12
If we would follow the uptrend we've been in for the past two weeks to the end of the year, we would arrive at over 41k. That's 10k more than the McAfee-Dick-Line predicts.
I don't think anyone believes that we will reach that target, so don't worry if we break an uptrend every now and then...
Also, if we continue to follow this trend, 10k will not be broken before May 5th. So patience!
We're on a very good run right now.

Whales shaking the tree to catch all the coins that drop out...
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:52:03
I've experienced the internet bubble. I didn't invest back then, because I thought it was crazy. Looking back it *was*. And it wasn't.
This time is similar in certain aspects. Especially regarding the market sentiments. But it's also different.
This time, with Bitcoin, you're not investing in a company. You're investing, or better: *betting*, that a protocol which isn't owned by a single company will be successful.
I know, I remember, back then everybody said: this is different from all the times before. And it wasn't. It was boom and bust. Same, same. But in the long run, it panned out. At least for a few companies.
In this case, we don't depend on a company to be successful. We depend on a protocol to be successful. It doesn't matter if the companies which are working on it will be. As long as there are companies working on it.
Not sure where I want to lead this other than: This is *indeed* different. It might end badly, too. But it just as well might not.

I'm pretty sure, there are a lot of investors waiting on the sidelines. Waiting for the moment when pure desperation kicked in, and the price falls really deep, to get a lot of coins for cheap.
But then again, this is just my personal feeling. Because I don't see the technology go away anytime soon.

Similar programmed bots listen to the same indicators and react at the same time. Then all the limit orders come into play, creating a cascade...
Of course, whales who know the indicators can use this knowledge to their advantage... But they are often not as important as many people want to believe.

@_date: 2018-04-13 13:53:37
I believe it will go down again. But not back to 6500. People have seen how easily it can rise again, they will use the next dip to buy in before it's too late. At least that is my plan for my next purchase.
So, I'd wait a few days for a larger dip.
But I could be wrong. The price is really unpredictable.

I wonder if all the people who are willing to "tether up" expected a lower price to get in again. 
This would have two consequences:
- They will eventually have to buy in at these levels if it doesn't get lower.
- It won't get lower, because most people who are willing to "go tether" already did. So nobody is left (or at least not many). Only holders. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:07:23
It is temporarily an investment. At some point value will largely peak, or at least grow at a much slower rate, and volatility will reduce...

@_date: 2018-04-14 12:45:11
You bet! ;-)
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:21:58
It's a trap!
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:06:56
I've seen. It seems, you are right. Hillarious!
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:52:39
You shouldn't buy (as a small guy) with the intention to move the market. We simply can't do that.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:45:38
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:46:19
up or down?
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:55:18
Think of this what you want, but I like to use this as an indicator of how well the Bitcoin price is doing. Not so well, lately.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:46:57
Why do we need to get there by August?
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:08:05
We are back on track!
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:34:31
boom! 
$9300 broken.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:32:38
This pricelevel is overgrazed. At least for the common folks. Everybody who wanted to buy did so, same with everyone who wanted to sell.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:10:00
5:00am in Tokyo. 
Some people wake up early, check the price and think: Wow! Cheap coins. Buy, buy, buy!
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:30:30
You seem to be a fan of D4rkEnergY...
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:33:32
Ok guys. Your last chance to get some cheap coins.
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:20:28
The 200 day moving average is at 9.9k. That one will be a very tough nut to crack.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:51:04
Are you serious? Shorters are one of the main reasons why the price went down so deep. This is a free market, and they can do what they want. But they won't get my compassion when they get rekt.
Hopefully, they will now think twice before shorting. This should make the price a bit more stable in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:48:05
Or down to 6k. We're still in a huge bear flag...
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:58:23
Not necessarily. The resistance is often the position of a moving average. That might have changed on the way down...
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:57:04
Think about McAffee what you want, but this chart is a really good indicator of how well the price is doing.
At least for this, and maybe next, year.
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:09:36
Nice candle.
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:18:44
FUD. 
If that would be Mt. Gox, it would crash much harder.
This is just normal market mechanics at play.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:03:06
I believe there will be another dump, but not yet.
I could be wrong, of course.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:07:02

@_date: 2018-04-01 18:59:43
In fact I think!
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:21:07
I felt a disturbance in the force. But now it's gone.

@_date: 2018-04-17 19:36:55
Institutional buyers won't catch the falling knife.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:56:43
And wait for a:
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:30:02
If the price stays above $7800 for the next 30 mins. We will have the first full candle above the downtrend in the 4h chart. This would be a very bullish sign.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:58:04
The question is: Which comes first? The Bitcoin price change or the short?

This "Daily Discussion" thread over the past few weeks gave me that impression...
And it seemed plausible to me, because I was on the verge of doing the same more often than I could count.
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:50:01


You haven't lost anything if you hold.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:03:16
It's natural to go down a little after a sharp rise. Don't you see the bull flag forming?
I'm usually more nervous when the price goes slowly up. Normally that means an incoming dump.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:18:43
... aand it's gone.
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:09:56
9k! A real milestone!
Someone should come up with a meme for that...
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:04:26
Was it good for you?
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:21:26
I could get used to this.
My "break even" is at 9900. This will be a big moment for me.
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:32:17
Sure. But now compare that to the risks you are exposed to, when creating a paperwallet as an average user (watch the linked video).
I'd say the risks are much higher. 
Having said this: I'd welcome hardware wallets which are even more safe than todays iteration.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:57:53
Then he should have said: "It is super obvious that it will drop to 8800"
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:56:45
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:45:09
You should update Electrum to the latest version. 3.1.3
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:33:53
Segwit has a better adoption now. So I guess, Bitcoin would be able to handle it better.
But I don't see a similar bull run like Dec. '17 happen soon. That would need mass euphoria. Right now we're working on getting basic confidence back.
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:22:03
Poor shorters...
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:55:26
Based on what?
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:51:39
and Girls
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:24:47
And back over 9k.
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:10:40
No, no,...he's resting.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:59:13
You only have half as much Bitcoin? How did that happen?
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:58:09
Why would the market feel forced to make a decision?
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:44:46
I always dreamt of owning a lambo. Please help!

We just haven't lost our good spirits, yet. Even when confronted with unspeakable horrors.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:03:36
I'm not just assuming: 
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:06:43
I think it's time soon for the next leg up...
But maybe only to test 9.4k, because that's the upper border of the uptrend channel. Will be hard to break that...
*If* it breaks through it will either be corrected immediately, or it will start a bull run.
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:20:02
Which brings us back to the question...
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:18:23
It's not just *some* protocol. It's the only protocol that managed to stay alive, unhacked (except for that one time very early in its history), for 9 years.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:42:40
And they aren't acting coordinated. And this makes them *stupid* in a sense, because their accumulated actions are easy to predict psychologically.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:49:54
I really don't see what you are seeing. But maybe that's why I would be a bad trader.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:12:40
Don't mistake crypto with Bitcoin... I was only talking about Bitcoin. I stay away from everything else...
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:14:51
You were saying?
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:56:22
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:41:22
Yes, we're all the same person in this thread. Except for you. It's all a great conspiracy to get you, yes you Itplanb, to buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:27:59
Quick! Come up with a meme for that, before anyone else does!
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:13:48
Not a government, but an exchange. Why? Because they will want to continue to operate in the U.S., legally. They already need to do a KYC to do so.
Of course, there are ways to obtain Bitcoin anonymously. But they are a bit more complicated. If you want to go through the hassle, try  or 
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:33:26
Profit $5 after fees and tax. Congrats!
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:55:25
No Lightning. All wallets which support Lightning are still in early beta. Electrum is your best choice if you don't want to use a hardware wallet. If you have more than approx 1 Bitcoin, or want to be totally safe regardless of the extra costs, I would recommend a hardware wallet.
Electrum Versions before 3.1 had a security problem. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:59:30
Don't worry. The use as currency is still years away, much time to optimize... 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:45:06
Not saying, you are wrong, but: ten minutes are over...
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:51:11

It has been foretold.

What exactly is your question?
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:40:43
To the moon!
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:50:24
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:39:03
Too much.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:46:21
I'm confused. Maybe I'll just hold and buy the dips...
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:38:32
We just touched a very strong downtrend line. It's at $7900 at the moment. This will be a hard nut to crack...

By making good posts.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:29:28
Probably not. 
But then again, what I've learned from watching the charts for the past months: 
If it does the same thing three times in a row, it will do something different the fourth time...

I could live with that.
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:17:48
I don't use binance, but I can tell you that UTC is the official timezone for Bitcoin trading. e.g. daily candles close and open at 0:00 UTC.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:55:01
If you don't like tax forms, just hold. And buy dips.
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:33:20
That's the right mindset.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:50:07
Nope. I got in in December. Didn't lose my faith. On the contrary!
And I am not alone.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:40:18
Here we go!

I would love to see it, though.

Sorry for the delay. We are experiencing technical difficulties...
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:44:24
I don't even like lambos.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:23:30
Or simply buy and hold...
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:43:35
I doubt that, too. 
The ecosystem has evolved massively during the past 9 years. Now there are well funded companies developing solutions to advance adoption. 
Just think of Lightning Network and all the surrounding APIs which have been released lately.
We are on the brink to step into the next level of adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:35:28
What happened?
To the moon!
I love Lambos!

Shorters getting rekt. 
Nice to watch.

Go Bitcoin!
We need a higher high.
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:43:22
What reversal?
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:44:16
Nothing's ever the same with Bitcoin, that's why TAs failed so miserably on this.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:52:47


Then you can throw the first stone.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:57:17
edit: I suggest you watch some videos by Andreas Antonopoulos to get a better understanding what Bitcoin is about. Then we can have a discussion.
e.g.

Cheap coins everyone!
(I believe, I'm bipolar.)
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:28:20

@_date: 2018-04-02 09:56:14
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:16:14
So you confirm our bet? 2:1?
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:33:10
I think you meant: Buy now!
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:29:05


To be honest: I don't believe that.
I expect another drastic jump soon. Just don't know the direction...
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:08:18
This was a "short squeeze".
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:52:52
That's just a phase. Bitcoin is experiencing puberty.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:43:43
No, it's too complicated. 
1.5137 is much simpler.
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:30:08
Where do you pull these numbers? The lottery?
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:07:43
It's just a healthy correction to the 50 hour moving average. We're still inside the uptrend channel. Zoom out and don't worry.
A good opportunity to buy.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:37:50
If you want an easy solution, you could use the zap-wallet. But it's not ready for livenet, yet. I expect a working version soon.
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:58:01
It wouldn't even be noticed.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:55:26
Goldbergger style. Is that you ?
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:21:31
I sincerly believe that news have had no effect on the price for the past weeks.

I believe he's talking about India.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:11:10
And if you look at the chart since July 2017, it's still heading up.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:54:05
The market is really undecided now, on how to proceed...
Shorts are going down. I guess shorters are not so sure themselves anymore, that this will crash. Not sure if this is a good sign. I always liked to bet against the shorters...
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:39:09
$8000. What is happening?
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:16:06
Actually it needs to go a little higher to stay in line with the uptrend...

I signed it, but I think it's useless.
Amazon *will* accept Bitcoin when it'll be profitable to do so. Bitcoin is on the right path, but it will take some time.
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:08:00
The edit still doesn't answer my question.
Do you want to trade or do you want to keep your coins safe?
You can't do both.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:45:15
The one hour chart looks nice right now. This is not a bear flag anymore. :-)
But it would be more clear if it breaks 7200...
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:32:31
We've been fooled so often in the past weeks by slowly rising prices. I just can't bring myself to fully trust it... yet...
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:42:29
At least my comment karma is slowly rising...
Edit: People are downvoting me. I guess it was a bull trap.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:04:44
The market is not impressed...
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:22:46
Right now, I wouldn't advise anyone in my circle of friends to invest. It's too risky.
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:28:38
You wish. $7800 is the target for now.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:57:27


I think so, too. But it was hard at times to convince myself...
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:14:08


is futile

I get the feeling that *someone* doesn't want Bitcoin to go below a certain level.
The bears are certainly trying...

Testing the 2017 pre-euphoria uptrend again. Will it hold? I hope so, but I'm uncertain...

"trap" is just the word for this particular pattern. Don't take it literally. A "bull flag" or a "bear flag" aren't actual "flags", as well.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:32:38


Hopefully it will be less volatile in a few years, but right now there are not enough market participants to even each other out. And there's too much money to be made in a volitile market.

Trading between coins is easy. So, many people (or rather: bots) do that when prices fluctuate, to maximize profits or minimize losses. It works similar to arbitage trading.
This couples the prices. At least in the short term.
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:00:29
Just wait for the official mainnet release of Zap. Then it will be as simple as installing any other software.

Sounds like a scam to me.

There is no reliable news about this market. It's all smoke and mirrors. From all sides. Sorry pal.
You can learn a bit about the technology from Andreas M. Antonopoulos. He is legit.

That was a prime example of a bull trap.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:57:11
For the most part the price was below the EMA50 on the daily chart. Which corresponds to the EMA4800 on the 15min chart depicted here. 
It would be nice to see a real breakthrough...
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:23:59

"BTCUSDSHORTS" on Bitfinex
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:19:15
If they have a website, they usually have a means of getting into contact. Either via email or via contact form, or twitter or facebook.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:25:51
Yeah, I wonder what the effect of this will be. Shorters were forced to buy Bitcoins. They are not holders, so I imagine they want to get rid of them...
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:40:12
you jinxed it!
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:47:41
Let's just skip that and move directly to $8300.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:58:52
No, because you don't need them to exchange value.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:17:16
Yes. Every dip. Since ATH. Slowly reducing my average cost.
If it goes down to 6k, I'll buy a little more.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:44:43
Yes. Trading between coins is a taxable event.
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:32:18
Dude, shorters increase the volatility of the market. 
Yes, I'd prefer it to be stagnant when compared to highly volitile. How can we expect any merchants to accept Bitcoin in their shops if the price is so unstable?
I'm not generally against shorters, they provide a necessary corrective. But the gamblers can stay away. Hopefully they got burned enough to be more careful in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:34:58
I'd have to add: Many traders wait for certain avarage lines to catch up after a pump, to be sure that this uptrend is "real" before they continue buying.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:08:21
I don't know if you remember the early days of the internet. 
*Everything* was tedious. But it got more easy, yet it is still based on the same protocol.
Bitcoin is a protocol. It will get easier to use it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:45:53
Afraid of your shorts getting squeezed?
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:06:02
See you later, buying back in at 10k.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:48:27
Buying is not taxable. And if you hold for more than a year, your capital gains are tax-free. 
At least it's like that in Germany. I'm sure most countries have similar tax laws.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:01:46
this might be the bull flag breakout. wouldn't it be nice?

Time for the next pump...
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:46:55
Yes. My secondary uptrend line is at 8900 right now. So that would still be fine, but not *that* great.
It would still be north of the McAfee-Dick-Line, though. :-)
It's also in line with the 200 hour moving average. There should be much support there.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:07:41

@_date: 2018-04-12 03:31:10
That would be quite the show. I'm sure many people shorted based on the predictions by the two top TAs on tradingview. Which both predict the start of the next leg down right about now.
*If* that doesn't happen, we'll see a nice squeeze...
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:05:47
It's at 9130.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:00:41
I just wondered what would happen if I pressed this strange button. Sorry!
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:44:39
Could still be a bull trap. Careful!
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:15:26
It really *wants* to get higher.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:37:02
I doubt it. If huge investors are entering, they are already doing it. Slowly, quietly, without driving the prices up. At least, for as long as it's possible.
They are not as stupid as mom and pop.

"This is good for Bitcoin". lol
But honestly, it is! 
Right now people are trading as if there were no taxes on every single trade. 
Once they realize that a trade will be taxed, they will trade less and hold more. 
This will reduce volatility.

I wouldn't mind 1 mio. by the end of 2020, too. But that's more in the realm of fairy tales...
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:13:10
How about now?
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:10:29
The EMA 1600 on the 1m chart has been a real support in the last 2 days. Everytime (3x) the price crashed below or near that, it bounced very quickly.
Now it's the 4th crash below it. Let's hope it will bounce just as quickly.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:58:09
I only pity you. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:49:32

I wasn't saying that "the world is on the brink of switching over to digital currencies". This will take a long time. Many years. And yes, volatility has to be reduced for that.
But we're close to the next level. Baby steps.
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:22:06
Because in some countries it's still possible.

There's something fishy going on. I've been watching the charts for the whole day. Then, when I had to do some shopping for a few minutes, the price shoots up.
It's always like this. I kid you not!

Same answer as always: Nobody can tell you that. The market is still very unpredictable.

A sweet, sweet trap. I enjoy watching it.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:02:37
Relax, we're still inside an uptrend. We will stay in it for the next ca. 9 hours without any movement in price. After that I would get worried...
The SMA200 on the 1h chart is a very strong support. I guess we will go up much earlier than in 9 hours...
If that fails, then yes, we will have a strong correction to the downside. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:11:47
butthurt much?
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:05:55

What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:39:27
It is certainly a possibility that you are right. It would be a perfect example of a bull trap.
I'm happy either way. If it crashes, I can buy more cheap coins. If it goes up, I'm happy for the coins I already own.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:38:54
I'm a holder. I cry when it goes down.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:22:56
And now squeeze all the shorts, please...
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:40:53
My personal next buy in point would be a little above 5.8k. I believe it's the same for many people, because that's the downtrend line. At least for now.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:11:34
Again? I though it "was done" 2 years ago.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:58:35
In one hour.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:11:41
Fair enough. I don't think it will go below 8k ever again. But I could be wrong. I'm sure, we'll see soon. Oscillations are flattening out. There will be a breakout soon. 
I hope it'll go up, but it might as well go down...
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:41:36
But it didn't.
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:31:03

10 x 200,000 / 51,939 =38,5 years of average US income. I know, it always looks like a lot of money until it is all the money you have.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:50:36
Funny thing is: I just can't imagine where all the money is coming from right now to push the price up. 
The "common folks" are out for now. They dropped their bags near 6k and are licking their wounds. They will fomo back in at a much higher price.
The hodlers (like me) already invested as much as they could.
Then there are short term traders, who tethered a lot, but I don't believe they will have enough power to sustain a run like this.
Who's left? Institutional money?

Ah, I learned something new today. 
I'm just glad I'm not a daytrader. It would break my neck.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:02:58
Break even is the moment when the fiat value of your coins is starting to be worth more than the fiat you used to buy them.

The extended "Spring Sale" is over. I hope everyone got a chance to purchase some sub-8k coins.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:53:58
I mean bear trap. It was just a short dump. Going up again now.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:57:20
Just the price on its own is cheap already. But they watch the sentiment in the market, and that's not desperate enough. People are still too optimistic. And when that's the case, the price can go even lower.
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:08:33
Banks can't do IT. That's where Bitcoin will fill the void...

Cheap coins everyone!
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:58:04
This is not what I had in mind.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:34:32
Because it didn't go up or down.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:02:35
To the moon!

My mind agrees with you. My gut doesn't. But I prefer to listen to my mind.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:50:34
Just don't go all in. So you have fiat money left to buy subsequent dips.

@_date: 2018-04-12 13:38:18
maybe. 
We're still in the downtrend channel. We need to stay above 7900 for a longer time to break free of that.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:41:50

Electrum is a good and secure software wallet: 
I'd say, this is your best option for now.
If you want to keep your coins *really* safe, use a hardware wallet like the ledger nano s: 
Although I believe that this investment only makes sense for larger amounts.
You could also use a cold wallet for safe keeping. It doesn't cost you extra, but is a little cumbersome. Here are some instructions: 
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:43:15
I see that it'll have a hard time to stay in the uptrend. But I don't see an intersection. We already left all the previous downtrends (linear and log scale).
*If* it goes down, which is a possibility, it would form an entirely new downtrend.
Or I'm blind...
Or we go back to the old downtrend, but that would mean around 5-6k, nearly instantly. I find that hard to believe...

Me neither. But hopefully some people do, driving the price further up.

Depends. Was the dip the trap or is this pump a trap? Instructions unclear.
Hold and buy the dips to be safe.

Hodling gains is easy. 
I've been hodling after buying in (a lot) at 15k, and buying dips (as much as I could) to average down to $9900.

Do you think there will be more shorts to be squeezed further up?
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:22:09


This is what we might actually need. Another panic sell-off, so we can restart the market cycle for good.
But I'd like it to be over already. It's no fun.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:18:08
Here we go!
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:21:54
Buy now, then wait a little and buy more.
This guys sees the possibility of sub 5k prices.
It might happen, it might not. If you buy a little now and it goes down after, you can still buy a little more to average your price.
If you don't buy now, and it goes only up, you would have missed out on this cheap price.

Just some groups pumping around. It might be because they can't dump Bitcoin anymore. So they're pumping and dumping alts in relation to Bitcoin.

The orderbooks can be deceiving.
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:58:15
Ituitively I would agree with you, BUT a slow increase in price is very often a sign of a fast drop approaching...
That's what I'm afraid of...

This is normal after a strong pump. Don't worry.

@_date: 2018-04-04 19:06:41
While I *do* believe that there's a lot of market manipulation going on. 
What some people here attribute to the *"whales"* is just ridiculous! 
A lot of the price changes, e.g. "gradual growth and then sudden drop", have always been typical for free markets.
That's "market psychology for dummies".

No, I was answering to and talking about goldbergger. But maybe this is your other account?
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:09:14
He didn't do that.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:56:21
Everybody FOMO!
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:04:15
"Bart Simpson" pattern confirmed.
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:49:53
Then he would have written "Looks to me like..."
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:00:27
I would like to take a moment and thank everyone who participated in this years "Bitcoin Spring Sale".
I hope you all got some cheap coins.
Prices are returning to normal now. This was your last chance to get 1btc for less than 8k. 
But of course our regular prices are still very cheap compared to the price you'll have to pay in a few months.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:50:40
This is a bear trap. Going up again...
Edit: Or maybe not...
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:25:52
Please never sell that.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:53:03
Closing in on the "McAffee line".
@_date: 2018-04-15 04:00:40
This is not euphoric. This is the baseline. 
When we are euphoric there are moon lambo memes all over the place.
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:24:44
You better control that.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:28:12
Maybe. But I'm pretty sure that he is not the only one.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:42:11
Didn't mommy tell you? Hold and buy the dips.
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:04:13
It will go hand in hand. But it's a slow process. Blockstreams new Lapps are a great addition to that, making it easy for developers to integrate Lightning Payment systems into their environment...
You have to think long term...
A pretty good talk about why institutions *will* enter the market:
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:46:40


No you shouldn't. Bitcoin is very risky. Everybody should decide on their own if they want to take this risk.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:37:40
Here is a zoomed out version, so you understand the origin of those lines...
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:46:58
Prepare for the next breakout...
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:46:31
It's 5:45 in Tokyo. I doubt that this is Asia selling.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:45:36
Thx. Now the price can finally go up.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:09:19
Moon now?
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:44:50
Interesting that most of the charts you "find" are by the same author...
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:02:18


Then you didn't understand OP. We had 3 breakouts in the past 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:08:28
It's 6am in Tokyo now. What will Japan do, when it wakes up?
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:23:15
I trust in the technology. And my time is valuable, I don't want to spend it on filling out tax forms.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:47:12
That's really crappy advice.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:11:12
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:52:08
Now do the same with December 1st.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:56:00
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:03:53
But why would you even do that, if you can just buy the same amount of coins for less money than it costs to mine them?
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:44:01
Yes it is.
I don't know for all of EU (different countries have different tax laws), but in Germany for sure.

Or: 
"Als privates Veräußerungsgeschäft gilt jede Aktion, bei der man eine Kryptowährung gegen etwas eintauscht. Dies kann etwa durch den Umtausch in Fiatwährungen, das Traden gegen andere Kryptowährungen oder das Bezahlen für Waren oder Dienstleistungen geschehen. Somit fällt nicht nur der Verkauf seiner Kryptowährungen unter eine etwaige Steuerpflicht, sondern jede einzelne Transaktion einer Kryptowährung, da auch in kleineren Fällen Gewinnrealisierungen anfallen. Auch beim Traden oder Zahlen gilt es deshalb, auf die Umsätze Acht zu geben."
In short: Every transaction is a taxable event, also trading between coins. If you didn't hold the coin for at least a year (FIFO rule applies), before making a transaction with it, you have to pay tax on the value it gained between purchase and transaction.

You mean like BitConnect?
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:26:47
I think they are not even worth mentioning anymore.
Just let the shitcoins die in peace.
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:52:31
So they're just sleeping?
