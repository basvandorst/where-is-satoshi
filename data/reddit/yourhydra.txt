i judged brock before i met him i was quickly proven wrong by both my intuition and by being around him. he's never uttered a bad word about anyone and he's kind. frankly, i'm growing tired of standing up for him and others in the space (like amir) who are judged. people need to mind their own business. if you care so much, make an effort to meet the person and spend time with them instead of jumping to conclusions.

did not like this place. they have it totally free from a btc enthusiast millionaire, and they are not utilizing the space well from my impression. felt like a frat boy startup office space to bring girls back to and show off. entire floors could be rented to startups etc. maybe I'm wrong but, that was the vibe. pure show, no energy or values.

the nicest thing is being able to do it anonymously. (wouldn't use changetip for that obviously), but with btc, you would not get harassed by the charity for more money in the future...huge plus.
even with your social media account tied to your donation, I don't think you'd be harassed in the same way as when you have to fill out that fucking donation form with all your info. you could also give directly to people in need and skip the charity 100%

Jon: RE: air guitar regulations:
If regulating air guitars makes the regulators happy, what's your objection?﻿
Manuel Amador
If regulating air guitars leads to the regulators caging or ruining many air guitarists who disobeyed the regulators but did nothing wrong, well, you now know the objection, so no need to ask dumb questions, +Gavin Andresen .﻿
Gavin Andresen
+Manuel Amador "Yes, sir, my air guitar absolutely positively complies with all Air Guitar Regulations And Guidance."  --&gt; I don't see the problem.﻿
Gavin Andresen
+Manuel Amador We're never going to agree on tactics.  I'm a pragmatist, so if putting star patches on my air guitar gives the people in power warm fuzzies, I'm happy to do it. I'll ask them exactly what type of star they'd like me to use and exactly where they'd like me to apply it, and while they were busy figuring that out I'll be busy working hard to get a few million more air guitar users. Being a majority protects people from assaults.﻿
Manuel Amador
 "Pragmatism" is code speak for obedience and cowardice. Majorities, by the way, have been slaughtered like pigs many times in the course of human history.﻿
Mike Gogulski
+Gavin Andresen 
Hey. Maybe +Manuel Amador's analogy was a bit thin, but I think he was referring to star patches by analogy to those that Jews were compelled to wear in WWII. That makes the star patch on one's air guitar a brand, which perhaps later will be used to round up air guitarists and ship them off somewhere nasty they'll never come back from, in accordance with Godwin's Law.﻿
Gavin Andresen
Walking along the beach this afternoon, enjoying the California sunshine, I think I realized where the fundamental disagreement lies.
Financial privacy / freedom is a larger issue than Bitcoin, and I personally think it would be better to fight that fight separately from Bitcoin.  Yes, Bitcoin is a great tool that will (I hope) bring us greater privacy/freedom. But I see advocating for Bitcoin as separate from advocating for financial privacy/freedom in general.
So: I think if you want financial privacy/freedom in general, then there is at least one US organization dedicated to that goal ( -- we should get them to accept Bitcoin donations). I hate reinventing wheels, and am a big believer in focused organizations and projects as the way to get things done, so I think the Bitcoin Foundation should concentrate on making Bitcoin successful.﻿

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
Bitcoin is free speech. The New York State Department of Financial Services is violating free speech.

@_date: 2014-09-07 11:36:33


you can catch a glimpse of what kind of guy Mike is from the condescending way he writes. "I'm better that you because I live in the real reality and my experience is more valid than yours" 


The niche is growing and fast. And it will not be a niche anymore with the right tools, tools he seems to want to prevent from developing. Also, who he perceives to be criminals, we may perceive as heroes. What a subjective term. State talk. State thinking. Assumptions. Obsession with preventative action. Egotistical. 


do speeding laws save lives? do people not drive recklessly because of laws or because they don't want to die? do more people die on the autobahns in Germany than on controlled highways in america? authoritative thinking. terrible comparison.


much lulz.

you didn't watch the video obviously. 
it's a right in terms of free speech. all that means is, the gov shouldn't be able to censor bitcoin.

no...it was said within context of the trial: "he fits the profile of a kingpin." this is not karpeles's trial it's ross's 
if ross is dpr he's a hero. if he's not, he's a hero.
karpeles is a piece of shit either way.

Funny how "educated" ppl need to reasert their intelligence by saying that they are educated and by dropping names like Nassim. Regarding my use of we it's because I know many people in the space who feel exactly like me, I am speaking directly to them. If you cared to do any research about me, 90% of my work is  anti collectivist. I am an individualist anarchist if you must label my beliefs.  ..scammers are inevitable in any space, especially a new space like this because human nature is often predatory. please go on because you have made yourself out to look like a poor excuse for genetic material. the only thing you're educated in is making assumptions
