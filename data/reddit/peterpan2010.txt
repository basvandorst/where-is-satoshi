Tethers from thin air are being used to pump up BTC, then BTC is cashed out through the noobs yelling "buy the dip".  You can play along and profit or be the sucker who HODL.

You are buying a bouncing dead cat that has been dead since the Nov/Dec ATH.  Notice that the bouncing is getting lower and lower with less volume?  At some point, the bounce will stop and crash will start.

I disagree.  BTC and cryptos are at the tip of all bubbles as they have no intrinsic value.  During a crash, first will be the cryptos, followed by derivatives, followed by overvalued stocks, followed by blue chips.  Safe havens are bonds and gold.

Definitely more useful than the usual "buy the dip!", "price will go up in Feb!", "shitcoin!" ..... you guys are clueless.

I noticed that whenever there is a drop, BTC seems to be holding much better than the other alts.  So question - for investment purpose, is there any reason to diversify since BTC remains predominant?

No clue.  I think the best guess is $200 + technology and infrastructure enhancements before 2013 till now.

But if everyone doesn't want to sell when there are people willing to pay higher price, how can price go up?  hmmm.

So this is where the 99% ... the 'Have Nots' hang out.  Sigh ... such an angry, irritable and delusional bunch.  Deriding fiat, yet measuring your precious BTC using fiat.  Trashing alts, yet not understanding that most are based on the same tech as BTC.  Wanting BTC price to go up, yet not understanding that it's this price swings that makes it useless as a currency.  All the traits of the 99% Have-nots.

Why do you think so?  I'm sorry but other than a lot of big claims like yours, I don't see any provide any rationale argument to support these claims.

We keep hearing "price will go up", "buy the dip", etc.  Can someone point me to any source of good reason to support this?  I mean, we can reasonably expect price of a company stock to go up when earning report is good.  So what's the basis for BTC or is it all just FUD?
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:38:37
Possible but unlikely.  Both spikes were manipulated and since there's a nice flow in place (Tethers -&gt; BTC -&gt; Cash), why induce another spike that will simply raise the alarm bells?

I'm not sure if South Korea government planning to hit their exchanges with a massive tax bill is good news.  But then again, it will probably just result in their exchanges passing on the cost to the traders though higher fees.

ROFL .... you can't refute the fact so you attack the messenger?  Anyone who can read a chart will know I'm right.

Can someone explain why the prices of major coins are moving up/down almost at same time even though their prices relative to each other is market determined?  I mean, you don't see USD/Yen/GBP moving up/down together ...
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:06:46
Fact - After the ATH on 17 Dec, each bounce has been getting lower and lower.  Very high volume only during price drops and low volume during price increase.  This means (a) standard dead cat bounces and (b) dumping with weak support for price increase.  Deal with the facts.

Good article.  This is not about BTC specifically but the entire economy.  In short, the cure to the 2008 crisis was 'quantitative easing'.  But the massive amount of liquidity pumped into the economy is now creating bubbles everywhere ... stocks, housing, cryptos ...
