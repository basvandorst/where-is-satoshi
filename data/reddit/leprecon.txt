The chains business plan is that they put down terminals in random fast food restaurants and allow online users to order from them. This results in the locally owned kebab shop being able to take online delivery orders, instead of customers having to call their number to place orders.
This is a service that lots and lots of random restaurants use. In Belgium it is so successful in boosting small independent businesses that big businesses which had the time and money to actually make their own online food ordering system actually joined this service. Pizza hut Belgium for instance is part of this, despite having their own online food ordering system. This in turn means that you can buy Pizza Hut pizza with bitcoin in Belgium.
**TL;DR:** Does [this]( look like one chain to you?

1. Use deregulated currency because it is deregulated
2. Get bit in the ass
3. Government doesn't step in because currency was deregulated
4. Demand people get sent to prison
Bitcoin is meant to be deregulated. They were meant to have nothing to do with the government and everything to do with yourself. 
If you want regulated online money you are looking for a creditcard. Highly regulated, lots of government protection, lots of safe guards and fallbacks, lots of bureaucratic pitfalls.

Sell someone elses phone? Did you read the op?

Ok, but that is besides the point. Saying "they followed all rules" and also saying "they broke some rules, bit only because they really had to" are contradictory statements.

I'm not sure what the truth behind this is, but at they are saying that blockchain broke the TOS by advertising their iOS app as on both the App store and on Cydia.

Just remember: if bitcoin is up, it is because it is a great idea. If bitcoin is down or people are losing money, bitcoin is still a great idea. Don't ever say anything negative about bitcoin, because if you do the bitcoin community will demonise you. Good luck!

Mac OS X allows you to run your own code however you want. Windows 8 has a desktop, on which you can run whatever you want, and a metro environment in which you can only run programs that you get from the windows app store.
How is Windows more open than OS X?

That is not an excellent source. It just says that government agents could be doing this. It offers no proof for whether or not they are actually doing this. I know the Chinese government has people on their payroll to propagate their propaganda. Does this mean I can now point at you and say you are a Chinese government agent?
Just saying "there are people who do X" isn't enough. You actually need to prove it in order for it to count as 'an excellent source to back up your claim'

And then when they drop bitcoin because it is costing them money, pester them again and say their attitude is to blame and if only they had done more they would have gotten a huge influx of customers.

It would be pretty weird if normal cars that can get you anywhere would already exist in 1886

What if he was logged-in as an administrator because he was actually doing some administrative tasks that must be done using this account?
That means he is the administrator?
If "he was only in complete control of every aspect of the website some of the time" is the best you can come up with then the best case scenario is that both he and other people were jointly in complete control of the website. That really isnt as good a defense as you think.

Dont rely on comments? Ross wasnt paying to kill undercover cops, he was paying to kill rivals

No. Entrapment is when police make you do something you wouldnt normally do. 
So lets say an undercover police officer asks you "want to buy some drugs" and then you buy 'drugs' from him, that is not entrapment. Now lets say the same undercover officer tells you "if you dont buy some drugs from me, I will hurt your family", that is entrapment. 
In summary, police can lie to you and offer you illegal services or products as long as they dont force you to make use of them. So a cop telling you "hey, if you want I could kill that guy for you" is a completely valid technique and not at all entrapment because you can just say "no thanks".

I do the crimes, which means other people don't do them. Me doing crimes is just a crime reduction technique! Simple really...
