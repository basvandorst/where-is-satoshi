This is way bigger that that. This is about new wallets being added to the ecosystem. And in addition users will pre-fund their wallets with more than they spend at any one time which in the short-run is a net buy. Yes, initially it may be like having "Microsoft Coins", but soon users will realize they can spend their "Microsoft Coins" globally wherever Bitcoin is accepted. It starts with a balanced supply-demand function between user (gamer) and merchant (MSFT), but secretly they are teaching themselves to be comfortable having a Bitcoin wallet and spending it.

Bitcoin expands access to the global financial system for the unbanked. Is there an age limit to that?

Yes they do. How many new and active wallets can this create once Microsoft accepts Bitcoin payment globally? Google IS coming, and one day perhaps Apple too. Medium to long-term bullish BTC.

Great explanation of Bitcoin. Not sure there's a better one out there. If someone asks you to send them info on Bitcoin so they can read and understand what it is, what would you send them? I think this article does the job by itself. Something like this has been missing. Awesome
