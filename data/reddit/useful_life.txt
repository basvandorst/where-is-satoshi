ASAP? Only if user has a printer and a bank note cliche) 
But that's not the point of bitcoin, **Youre_The_Pedo**. If all you want to do is convert them lol.

Good idea. I thought about adult market. But if you purchase something online - you still lose your anonymity on delivery. But at least you aren't giving away your credit card.
Maybe buying access to some website or service with bitcoins will work.. hmm... what is embarrassing to ask for?

I do see the uprise of "only bitcoin" companies. But don't you think that this way is very vulnerable?
A bigger company which accepts credit cards (PayPal/Debit/etc...) can just add bitcoin one day and win the market?
Bitcoins strength is anonymity. That "Killer-app" you are talking about will use it to the full. What do you think?

Correct! BitLotto was exactly what [and [thought about in this thread. Who knows what happened to them? 
There is a wiki page about BitLotto [here]( It says:


Anyone heard about the reasons? Or who was behind BitLotto?

Do you have knowledge in that area? Can you explain it better? I wonder how internet-based lotteries/casinos work in US and global market? 
China is a big bitcoin player, and I think lotteries are strictly regulated there too.

Over saturated markets often do not have at least one good product.

I agree, that is a very promising idea. There is a reason why Windows Phone market often is forgotten and that reason is few people use it.
