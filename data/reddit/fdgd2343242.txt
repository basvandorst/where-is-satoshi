maybe bitcoin could be introduced via a superbowl commerical for some business that accepts bitcoins. The word bitcoin could be said in a funny voice at the end to emphasize it.. it would actually be a stealth advertisement because the ad would be for some other product or service, but people might still remember that they heard 'bitcoin'.

Just tried this and it works really well.. really fast turn around (took less than 10min) a good price and convenient instant payment via online banking.. 
I don't know if the sellers are going to get burned by people using this to cash out hacked bank accounts, but right now I know of no cheaper or easier way to get BTC.

Online banking transfers between bank accounts at most banks in the UK are now instant and free.  - you can also use barclays pingit which is a phone application and backend systems at barclays that allow you to register a UK bank account with them and then send and receive money using mobile phone numbers as the only identifier.
This is also instant and has the added advantage that you don't have to publicly disclose your bank account number and could just use a throwaway mobile number too.
There are other sites that operate similarly on a p2p model, ie: localbitcoins, bitmarket etc, but I think Bitbargain is really onto something here with their timeouts and SMS notifications. It speeds up the process so much that it's no-longer inconvenient compared to an automatic exchange. I was just thinking and realized another big difference is you don't need to talk to the sellers at all.. the entire interaction is scripted on both sides. Perhaps not as friendly, but keeps things super efficient. I look forward to seeing this adopted in other markets around the world.
