Not really. Bitcoin requires tech that cash doesnt. They function differently
@_date: 2016-04-01 12:47:02
Absolutely not. What's the point of abolishing it? Cash serves many purposes. It's comforting to have physical representation of a medium of exchange. It creates a physical limitation to spending. You normally get to talk to another person when conducting a transaction (a pro and con). It can be fun to have in its own way. Just like gold, bitcoin, and even credit cards have a place in commerce, cash should always have a place.

The Congressional hearing was huge but it's rarely mentioned in regards to the rise to ath. From my viewpoint the overall climate was ready for a big rise, and China was important but the Congressional hearing was the spark.

To clarify this, the number of bitcoin potentially in circulation is increasing due to mining, while lost wallets decrease coins in circulation. These two act against each other. The difference is we know the rate of coins being added, we don't know the rate of wallets being lost. But yes, there will always be 21 million that exist.

I feel like this is what people are going to settle on when referring to blockchain technology. It's a broader term that can refer to more than just a blockchain, but it describes it in terms people are familiar with.

That's going to take awhile. Censorship broke this community in two- people who can post here, and people who lurk but don't post their opinion. No other sub or forum grew enough and developed to be worth most people's time. So unless certain mods concede to allow discussion on a range of subjects that are currently deemed as part of the "other" there will be a group that keeps their mouth shut. Not healthy. Even if core is moving in the right direction, the way certain people used their position to silence a vocal group was really discouraging.

You'll need to clarify how bitcoin can 'go bust'. In terms of banks- "going bust" means they don't have the actual cash at hand to pay back their depositors. With bitcoin, unless you allow someone else to hold the private key, you have full ownership of the bitcoin. So it can't "go bust" like a bank can.  
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:01:51
It sounds like you need to do a little more research before jumping in headfirst. I recommend if you're going to buy any, start off realllly small. Play around with it. Get comfortable with the concept of third party vs owning the private keys. Make a paper wallet, learn how to make one offline. Learn how to get your money out of cold storage. Then look into development, what problems can this tech solve? What are the competitors? 
Make a plan. And don't keep your money on an exchange. 1. Possibility of exchange going down, or 2. You'll get emotional and trade for a loss. 
Yes there's a chance for ROI but there's also a chance to lose everything. I would read up more before doing anything if I were you.

If you had bitcoin in Coinbase during the BCC fork you will gain access to them January according to Coinbase. It's up to you if you think you should find a more secure method of storing your coins. Researching hardware wallets can't hurt either way!

Learn Learn Learn. As much as you can. Check the sidebar and read it all. Watch videos. Be wary of scams. There are many.

Tried to find that video because I remember watching one of him in a coffee shop and it must have been like 2013 or 14. No luck. But I do remember listening to him a bunch on Let's Talk Bitcoin. I would specifically listen to the episodes he was in. They were the best ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:13:09
I doubt it would scare away customers as long as you have other methods of payment displayed. You probably won't find many people buying with bitcoin for a number of reasons. But you never know!

Stuff here and there. I bought Cryptonomicon with bitcoin (which was a great book) Some coins. A few other things. 
The thing is, it feels harder to part with bitcoin than it does fiat. So I buy less stuff with it. There could be a few reasons for that.

The first time I was sent bitcoin and heard the blockchain.info chime I got chills. It was almost instant. Then watching blockchain explorers, realizing this network spanned the globe and was literally crossing borders that could not have been crossed before without a great deal of time and resources. And how much more accountability I suddenly had by being able to manage money this way. Mindblowin'
Of course it hasn't been an easy ride to this point for many. It was a real wild west back when I first got involved in the space. I luckily managed to make it relatively unscathed but many people lost a lot of money. So there is a danger factor which is unfortunate but if you didn't get screwed it can be exciting (double check your send address and miner fee, y'all). 
Then there's the possibilities with what it can do. It's not the only coin in town anymore but it's still boss status. And there is so much innovation now that the possibility of bitcoin being a major player in asset ledgers of the future is huge. 
Plus it's just fun to play with. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:22:46
I don't really get the point of teaching kids about bitcoin unless you want to use it as a vehicle for teaching them more important basic skills such as programming, internet security, math, and how to intuitively recognize scam artists.

Sorry Shibe, your coin has its place, and it's doing 100x better than I ever expected- so props. I just don't see it being a front facing payment option for most serious businesses.

To add to this I think the attitude from those who were against 2x should be at least cautiously conciliatory. Let's try to make peace for awhile. Establish common ground. I think the community as a whole will be stronger if 2x supporters are accepted back in without too much hostility.  
@_date: 2015-08-29 04:17:04

It's a basic intro to all the concepts. So it might be hard to listen since it covers the ideas you are probably very familiar with. But it's interesting to hear how Bitcoin is being introduced to new people, and he does briefly talk about his experiences going to mining complexes in China which is cool.  
But yeah 99% of it is Bitcoin 101. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 10:52:25
You ain't diversifying by mixing alts into your bitcoin holdings. If you want to actually diversify, look into other assets. 
That being said my crypto breakdown is: 98% BTC 2% Other.
I liked coins that built on top of Bitcoin so Mastercoin and Counterparty were the first two I was interested in. (MSC busted hard as far as I've seen. XCP seems to still be doing something but for the most part is just a hive of even worse altcoins than Ripple) Speaking of Ripple- I hate it but it looks like that one is gonna stick around for awhile. It was fun to play with.
Ether is the only one I'm currently intrigued by. I mostly do it to test their functionality and get a feel for their style. 
I avoid stuff like maidsafe and augur because that shit is so rabitholey I can't even begin to justify it.

There is a difference between coordinated and a large group in favor of one side of an argument. This is an online political movement gaining steam because the few in power are mishandling their responsibilities. Brigades are groups crossing into other subreddits. This is not brigading. Period. 
Now coordinated? Sure, to some degree but you don't get this much backlash without a good amount of people naturally agreeing something is rotten in bitcoinland.

I imagine their system would continue to run the way it does now, and they're seeing if blockchain tech has any advantages they can use for expanding services/improving their process behind the scenes. My guess is they'll develop their own thing, compare it to Bitcoin and see what each one can do separately/combined. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:46:22
I'm calling bull on this post. 


Seriously? The vast majority of people want a modest BS increase. That still wouldn't even compete with existing payment systems.
Anti BS increasers seem to be the most obstructionist oriented group in the Bitcoin space. They don't want to change anything with the core protocol because they want to OWN the fix. I'd prefer improvements be implemented directly, and it's pretty clear the majority shares that sentiment. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 04:25:16
It's not dead. But don't go rushin to buy any because even if it doesn't  actually die it certainly can lose a ton a value very quickly. Get a little and play with it. Learn how it works. Make mistakes with satoshis.

This is excellent news. Even if you supported 2mb blocks. It just wasn't the way to go about implementing the change. There needed to be more support from the community. There wasn't even close to a consensus.

Terry Gross interviews Nathaniel Popper, author of Digital Gold.

OP said buy **with** bitcoin. Meaning they'd rather wait for the price to stay relatively stable before they buy with it. I can see if you thought they said "buy bitcoin", how it would not make sense.

Guaranteed they'll try to work with their own attempt at a fork first. But yeah, if Bitcoin turns out to make more sense (if blockchains make sense for them at all), no doubt they'll start scooping up companies.

Yeah but you gotta ask how much would you actually have held onto if you bought at that price. Of course if people had a time machine they'd buy and hold but if it doubled in price I bet you would think twice about selling half to make back the initial investment. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:45:48
You're right- no one gives a shit about what I think individually. But if a large portion of people who are interested in this technology think it needs to be improved and see nothing but divisiveness, they can leave for something else. Or just leave. My main concern is your dismissal of Gavin's arguments. In the long run it makes sense to increase the block size. The longer it is delayed, the harder it will be to implement. Other services that can solve the problem don't strengthen the network as much as a core improvement. I would love if anyone with a decent computer could run a node. I don't want consolidation of influence, but the pro BSI camp has very clearly offered a number of compromises and attempts at finding a middle ground. Anyone anti BSI seems to be all hardliners. "Just wait" doesn't cut it. This community needs to prove it can come up with a plan forward that covers both side's concerns and then follows through. Otherwise it's just downhill from here.

This thread is insane. A huge corporation is researching a new technology. They aren't running around clueless/panicked.
