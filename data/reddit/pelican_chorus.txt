I'm saying that there's a lot of magical talk in this thread (and elsewhere) like "the best thing about bitcoin is THE PEOPLE invested in it" and "Once it's spent, there are no unfair rules that funnel wealth back up to the top like in fiat."
I'm saying that actually, if it's widely adopted, there are **tons** of unfair rules that will funnel this wealth back to the top.
So far the only ways you've found that it will stop the wealth funneling up is lack of printing money (agreed) and being able to illegally hide your wealth from the government (that seems outside scope, since you can do the same thing with gold or whatever).
I'm saying that the other pieces of the system that funnel wealth back up to the top are much, much more powerful (the law, the courts, taxes, bailouts), so your reasoning for how this will help "the people" and prevent wealth going up are little drops in the bucket.
It's fine to like BTC, but if it's ever widely adopted it's still going to mostly held by the same 1% as now, since their current cumulative wealth and power to keep the existing legal status-quo is much greater than any in-on-the-first-floor Bitcoin millionaires. They're already starting to take large pieces of the action.

This thread started with:


You said:


*Now* you're saying sure, there may be a whole structure of unfair rules that **will** funnel that wealth back up to the top, but anything that doesn't *directly* relate to printing money is outside the scope of this thread.
Got it.

Heck, **you** were the one bringing up "bail-outs" first in this thread. I'm assuming that you now at least agree that was a specious argument, since you haven't brought it up again and keep harping on about printing money?

I'm trying to understand your position, and the advantages of BTC. I haven't had this conversation hundreds of times.
You talked about there being "unfair rules that funnel wealth back up to the top" with our current system. I agree that those rules exist, and that many laws maintain or increase the economic divide. I'm just really trying to understand how they don't apply to BTC.
My understanding is that the majority of the pieces of the structure that maintains this division, and "funnels wealth to the top," is the structure laws, taxation, and government spending.
From what I can tell, you understanding is that the **only** piece that matters is the ability to print money.
I'm sure I'm getting your position wrong, but if not, I can't agree with you. For example, you mentioned governments bailing out companies. This is not done by printing money. This is done by spending taxation revenue.
The ability to print money seems to me to be a minor part of the system that maintains the division of wealth. All the rest of the system still applies to Bitcoin, like it does to stocks, or holding Euros, or gold. So I don't see how Bitcoin solves this, since the state's laws still apply.


...well, yes, all of my understanding is based on following the law. If we're assuming hiding wealth from the government, that's a different ballpark, since you're just talking about illegal activity. I could equally say just hiding all my cash and not reporting it is a new paradigm to affect the wealth structure in the US.

Just wait till you discover paper money!!

And why do you think that doesn't apply to BitCoin?
As BTC is being invested in more by WallStreet, it will be treated more like any other asset by the law, like stocks or whatever. It's still taxable. It can still be subject to civil forfeiture, under threat of jail. The US Government can still bail out a company that lost all its BitCoin, just like they could a company whose stocks collapsed.
What your describing as being unfair has to do with the *law*, not with the specific assets people hold. The law applies whether people hold value in dollars, stocks, bonds, crypto, or gold.
So again, what rules apply to dollars that "funnel wealth back up to the top" that don't apply to BitCoin?

What "rules" apply in fiat that don't apply here?
If you took 10,000 people and handed them $1M USD each, what rules would force the money back up to the top that don't apply with BTC?

If you really are a financial advisor, then I'm glad I'm not your client, given that your advise to this person boils down to "keep 90% of your assets in one extremely volatile asset, because 'Hodl'."
From OP's post, this is clearly a large amount of money to him. The idea that anyone should have a large amount of their net worth in a single unstable asset class is completely ludicrous.
But it's ok, because I'm guessing you're not actually a financial advisor.

I just realized why I always found the talk of "Lambos" so distasteful.
It's because it reminds me exactly of the language in all the multi-level marketing schemes, where the "nirvana" state is to buy a pink Cadillac.
Every time someone is being scammed into entering a MLM scheme, people talk about the pink Cadillac. Every time people say online that the schemes don't work, dozens of people pop up to say that *they* got their pink Cadillac, or know someone who did, or their mother once worked with someone who did. And the post is down-voted by everyone who doesn't want to doubt that they'll get their pink Cadillac, and the readers are all shamed into sticking with the MLM scheme or they'll never get their pink Cadillac. (*Edit: Cadillac, not Mercedes*)
