Good job OP, you blew his cover.

I can't ever see Bitcoin becoming widely adopted. It's unwieldy, it deflates, scalability is untested, it still can't be bought in majority of countries (!) and the transaction fees might become a stumbling block.
How will the majority of people adopt Bitcoin in the first place?

Dishonest miners that centralize power and attack ones who mine as intended can increase their gains. The paradox is that honest miners benefit from being attacked.

I think that's wishful thinking. The government won't allow the use of Bitcoin because they have no control over it. If Bitcoin ever becomes a threat, the government is more likely to stamp it out than accept it.
Here's [the case of Bernard von NotHaus]( He printed his own [Liberty Dollars]( and eventually got indicted because he:

This is a huge assumption. The amount of work needed to just get started is simply too much for an average person. Where's the convenience fiat offers?
I've been downloading blockchain for two weeks now on my brand new external HD. 122 GB? Do you know how many people have shitty hardware that will never be able to process that? I just don't see it ever happening, though I'm still curious if and how it will.

 Well, now that I started I might as well go through.

Agreed. It's a meme on this subreddit to "HODL" (which I guess means to hold), but if everyone acts like that, why would any sane person spend it? Over time, this means most BTC will pool around long-term investors who will just HOLD.
Some BTC will get lost forever on a yearly basis: cold wallets get lost, damaged, destroyed, owners of BTC die and their BTC with them and so on. So, the pool of available BTC will only shrink once they're all mined. And then what's the future of BTC?

Seriously? Every tutorial on BitCoin says to first choose a wallet.
I downloaded BitCore and it's been ["syncing up" for 2 weeks now.](
If that's not the way to do it, then that proves my point – Bitcoin is really cryptic.

Billionaires have wealth because they offer money for services which they get more money for. Unless people are willing to accept Bitcoin for services, you'll never get billions out of it.

All right then, if the wives, husbands, doctors and nurses don't demand payment in Bitcoin, there will be no massive need for it. In that case, why would it ever become an actual currency rather than a novelty?
But ask yourself, has 90% of people even heard of Bitcoin? How many of them know how to use it?

Censorship isn't a scalpel, it's more like carpet bombing, to paraphrase Bruce Willis. I think the better option is ridicule.

Reddit by default discourages interaction between subreddits. You're meant to literally have a separate account for each subreddit you frequent or the mods can accuse you of "brigading" i.e. discussing topic of subreddit 1 in subreddit 2. Conveniently, this also inflates Reddit user numbers, which helps the company attract investors.

How often do you participate in them? If you're just lurking, nobody can tell but in some cases I was automatically banned from some subs because I was subbed to others. TwoXChromosomes is the most egregious offender in this: try subbing to r-theredpill and posting in TwoX, you'll get auto-banned in latter.
