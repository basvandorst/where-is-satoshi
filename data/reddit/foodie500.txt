How much did he receive in donations?
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:22:15
 Plus the hot Latinas! Lol
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:27:41
Just wait until more people borrow and go into debt to buy more bitcoin, this number will go way higher
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:03:13
Yeah I had that issue too, I had to open a new account using a different email then it worked 2nd time
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:31:26
Is your company e.g. the provider of your 401k doing anything about it?
Isn’t broker/401k accounts FDIC insured?
I don’t get what happened here
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:29:39
Where the fuck have you been? After the hurricane their electrical grid is ruined no electricity for 4 months now! Just imagine if the US lost power for a single day. To me while it may not be 3rd world say day it’s no place I would want to live lol
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:18:57
Lol it’s nothing to worry about man 
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:50:44
Open a new account using a different email. My 2nd try it worked for me 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:37:36
Hmmm it worked for me the 2nd time but now it’s waiting verification which may take a long time
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:51:17
How high does this next leg up take us?
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:02:03
But when will the price hit that number?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:14:00
  No nothing. They just said to try a new one and it should work. I’d say wait a week and try creating a 3rd eventually it will work. I know they are doing upgrades lately
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:21:18
Don’t know why anyone who makes a fortune would try to go to a 3rd world country to avoid taxes and live a poor standard of living, just don’t get it. I can understand going to a wealthy country like Switzerland 
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:06:19
I pick  then although it’s very unlikely or  which right now seems unlikely but if the momentum picks up again very doable. 
It would be good to see these peoples track record on previous price predictions otherwise I can pull a number out of my ass too =)
It’s coming out....$86k in 2018
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:00:53
Guess timing matters, maybe I was lucky to have it work on 2nd try. Try coinbase but they only offer 3 coins
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:08:18
It was an example to show how the price follows metcalf’s law. Go look at the data and price charts you’ll see the strong correlation 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:28:38
I opened at kraken. All exchanges will require IDs and lots of info to get verified with higher limits just do it better than missing out
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:23:13
So you just have to live their for 6 months then you can basically move back to US and it won’t be an issue?
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:57:54
I’d say wait try again in a week or two. For me it worked but that was last month they may be having more issues now again. What coins are you trying to buy? If your not picky try coinbase too 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:56:33
This will just lead to a strong rally eventually. Wish I could add on the dip
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:08:41
They want to attract the little guys who have a few hundred to play with. Other than that it’s just perception that something that is $2k in price is expensive while something priced at $20 is cheap. Of course those who know about investing know that not to be the case. All in all it’s bullish for the trust
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:26:08
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:44:14
Is this the first time your wire this large amount after getting tier-4? Btw, what did they ask you for to approve you for tier-4?
The limits are pointless if you can’t use it to withdraw everything one day if you ever needed to cash out immediately 
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:33:52
For people hoding why would it matter to move to a segwit address since they aren’t ever going to use it until they exit their position?
Also why would legacy fees be higher in the future? Doesn’t this depend on the overall network if it’s backed up or not regardless if it legacy or segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:08:32
But can you explain what happened? I’m not following... your 401k provider is corrupt or a mutual fund you invested in is run by a corrupt company?
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:35:56
What is this for? Exchanging between coins?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:03:04
All money will come back to BTC eventually, it always has and always will
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:05:53
It’s in Delaware no wonder, what a dump
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:24:51
If you look at metcalf’s law the value of a network is square the number of users on it.  I like to look at transaction volume if you look at the past one year it went up a little over 2x and price went up more than that about 10x look at eth transaction volume was up 20x last year thus price up exponentially more up 70x. As long as transaction volume increases the price will always increase far greater
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:44:35
What kind of proof do they need? Can’t you just show your purchase trade confirmations?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:22:42
Dredging page or trying again later works sometimes, I’ve seen something show as disabled then refreshed page and that message gone
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:34:29
You can buy GBTC it’s a bitcoin trust but trades at a premium due to demand, premium fluctuates but will stay until their are ETFs approved so you are good for a whil
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:34:29
If average rise is 150% after correction, how’d you get a $33k target? That would be 200% off the bottom? I do think it’s possible since recent correction was larger than average so rally could easily be 200% or more
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:58:30
Then I would try kraken again in another week
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:26:13
But when will it go live? We desperately need it
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:41:34
For those just holding or hodling why would they move from a legacy wallet to a segwit? Wouldn’t seem to matter to them right?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:25:34
Doesn’t look like you will be able to using kraken based on peoples comment here.
Also coinbase is likely to add ripple in 2018 too I feel
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:44:32
If it does so has he, he’s the creator
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:03:35
2 more years of 10x growth gets us there!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:13:55
My ticket has already been escalated and still nothing. Verify account is still disabled, I tried creating a 2nd account using a new email and didn’t even get the activation link. At this point I’m stuck and can’t do anything =(
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:49:20
 Can people start tagging their employees here?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:23:25
How do you disable multi-device? This is a good idea but I didn’t see any option for that
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:27:00
Who would want to live there?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:22:30
Had anyone successfully sold and withdrawn back to BofA checking account recently? Like last few months?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:03:53
I’ve never created an online wallet before, so you need to do it offline? How does that work? Which sites are reputable? 
Might want to have an online or on mobile phone wallet for small amounts for purchases 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:09:28
She said they bought in 2015 so there was no premium at that time of course she doesn’t care about the premium, what stupid questions!
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:13:53
True. But when you first setup and create the wallet it’s done online.  Guess as long as the device is sealed when you get it, nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:02:16
The recent growth is from small individuals. Next year it goes mainstream and the Wall Street whales and big money comes in, I don’t see why we can’t go up another 10x if we’ve done so this year and the big money is just entering. Sounds crazy but we could be well above $100k one year from now. Of course we’ll see huge corrections on the way up
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:02:51
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:38:31
Why? If they are secured the same way it doesn’t really matter?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:16:40
Deals with IBM and some big banks it’s being adopted and also rumors coinbase will add it which is why it’s up in last week while everything else is sinking 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:27:22
When will next halving start bring prices in? I’m guess in 2019 a year before it will start getting factored into the price
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:54:18
It’s sad that cryptos were created to end corruption by banks and the elite yet corruption is rampant in this space!
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:39:16
What why? Was thinking of opening there too the more accounts the better just in case. Coinbase is good they just don’t offer enough alt coins and I want to get into some alts before they get listed their and spike
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:18:13
This guy has been right on with his stock market predictions over last few years and now his bitcoin predictions have been spot on too. This guy is credible
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:53:46
This is a well needed correction... too many people opening account and buying cryptos without even know what it is or how it works. This correction will clear the way for a run up to $30k by February/March 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:39:58
Good analysis! People don’t realize that half the world is dirt poor and will never have money to own anything but still even 1b people wanting some BTC and we can see how high we can go
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:42:30
Good point on the open source part. Guess creating the wallet offline is a good idea to be safe and also to test it out for a while before putting any larger amount on it.
Was just surprised because I’ve read a lot online people say hold your own keys and use HW wallets but no one mentions to go offline when creating the wallet even web using a HW you can go offline too
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:20:09
So you have tier-1? What is limit?
Btw, what other exchanges do you use? Any other suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:06:30
What coins does poloniex support buying with fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:10:34
What are these airdrops? Do they just show up in your wallet when viewing on block chain.info? I don’t remember seeing any? How do you sell them or exchange for BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:04:42
Momentum is strong right now, the whales are coming! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:16:19
Yeah I know, I feel by that point we would be around a peak in price. Maybe become more stable and used as a currency. The reduction of mining is already know today so it would be priced in by then which is why if I had to guess I’d say we peak a few years before or around 2033.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:35:30
Has anyone been able to sell and withdraw back to their BofA checking account USD? I’ve only bought and never sold so I want to know 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:01:48
The fees will go back down, people need to relax...this has happened before and it will go back down to a few bucks fees eventually 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:13:59
If he is that young, smart and successful then he can afford to invest half of it...he could always earn it back if he’s smart and ambitious worst case
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:24:33
WTF, it’s been like that for 3 weeks for you!? This is so bad
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:59:54
When? Few weeks? Months?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:20:10
Thanks for this information!  Wonder how exchanges go about create the wallets in peoples accounts, makes me wonder.
So you should disconnect the internet while on a site before creating your wallet? Is that what most people do?  No one really mentions this part to newbies
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:08:36
So you sold but can’t withdraw back to your bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:38:48
For those who bough in 2013 they are set for life, if they are too greedy to pay 20% taxes then they got issues
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:46:15
Oh ok I didn’t know you could do that. I’ve never used an online wallet to create keys before.  So being offline ensures your keys aren’t intercepted by someone but doesn’t help if site/provided is not legit
What do you use or recommend for an online or on phone wallet to keep small amounts?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:40:54
Not really, in one week will be back up to $18k... just a correction in a long term uptrend no big deal
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:45:11
So fees will go back to $1-2 by Monday you think?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:32:40
Best part of the interview!
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:52:28
These people in the media have a vested interest so don’t take what they say too seriously. The future is bright but let’s not get carried away
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:43:56
Depends how much you own. Price can reach $100k so you do your math, don’t expect it to go to 1mil
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:08:52
Thank you =)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:12:00
Open a new account using a new email I did this yesterday it worked now
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:22:17
My ticket number is 1164163, appreciate any help you can provide.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:37:55
Sorry. Is authy any better btw?
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:53:42
Seriously this will put people in danger!
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:13:10
Ok Thanks! So the launch must of been delayed I guess since that article was from 15th? Ahh saw latest update, guess I should of opened an account months ago 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:21:51
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:31:39
Seems like all exchanges are swamped, just imagine how much money is waiting to get into cryptos that can’t even get in yet!
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:03:18
Is it available on mobile phone?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:19:56
But with stocks brokers report only your sales do its up to the person to provide the buy price or not. Not the same here when they are requesting all info 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:41:53
If you are using a tool or site online how could you create the keys offline? Besides getting the source and running it locally is there another way?
Seems like no matter what you have to trust some source that could be a bad actor 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:28
The average person today just doesn’t get it or takes the time to educate themselves. They will be the ones buying the peak in 5-10 years
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:07:19
Google Authenticator doesn’t have this setting
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:07:47
You should hold until all 21m coins are mined that is when it will peak.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:58:41
Wish they had more alt coins that can be purchased with fiat. I’m trying to open account at kraken for this reason but it’s a mess I’m stuck with nothing opened yet!
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:57:37
Is BTD blockchain even official yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:47:12
Update: I signed up for another new account as suggested but never received the activation code email. This doesn’t seem promising uhhh
Update2: I just logged a support ticket  with all the details. If you could please help I’d really appreciate it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:30:17
Launches? They are having a new site? Are there any other US exchanges that I can get verified quickly that support alt coins buying with fiat such as ripple?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:15:42
Hi, I opened the account yesterday. I have not opened a support ticket for this, are you saying I should do that the verification feature becomes enabled? Thanks so much.
Update: I signed up for another new account as suggested but never received the activation code email. This doesn’t seem promising uhhh
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:29
It would only take 2 more years of the same 10x growth as we had this year. Keep in mind this years growth was not even be big whales that are just entering next year. Just saying
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:22:36
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:42:25
Really? I feel it has gone up so much lately it’s probably priced in.  I was reading about Stellar similar use case as ripple and recently IBM partnered with them. Either of those 2 look promising if you want to diversify outside of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:15:19
True, might just have to wait to buy ripple when coinbase adds it, this cost me a lot as price will probably double or more just when they list it!
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:57:17
At current rate 99% will be mined by around 2033 so I think the price will peak around then. But yeah what you said makes sense too lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:31:16
But I’m sure they too will be slow. Even a month or two delay can be very costly from a price entry standpoint.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:25:27
Ok, does bittrex offer altcoins purchases with fiat? That’s what I’m looking for really like ripple, dash, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:35:45
Wow just to be able to start the verification? I bet getting verified might take months then
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:49:26
They report proceeds only. Not the cost basis that is what you report
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:09:30
Seriously, corporate life sucks
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:54:49
Are there any other good less known US exchanges people can use? I’m guessing the IRS is going after them since they are the biggest
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:28:01
Soon you will have to change it to BTC/Tesla 
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:57:02
At &gt; 70% dominance it’s time to diversify into alts and at &lt; 40% it’s time to only hold BTC that strategy would work well 
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:54:10
And after being up 70X in less than 1 year you didn’t think you should take profits?
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:45:59
It should really be higher in reality BTC is the only coin accepted as a medium of exchange and that has infrastructure built around it, should be 75% dominance right now
@_date: 2018-08-05 07:00:25
Meaning other coins are over valued and BTC is undervalued and it will eventually go back to a higher dominance as it had in the past
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:22:22
Move it to an IRA and buy gbtc don’t wait
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:43:58
Where can I hear these podcast from? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:14:43
If we weren’t in a bear market we’d be up 25% on this news!
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:49:15
I agree you should hodl but don’t fool yourself, taking a short term capital gain and paying taxes on a 500% profit is better but hard to find markets best to hodl on
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:58:08
As long as he is hodling he will come out ahead. Once price goes up the herd will chase and it will hit $50k easy
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:05:19
Why would it destroy credit history? As long as he pays each month it won’t. As for interest it will be nothing if we moon. Someone young can take the risk, don’t assume everyone is old, has a low pay jobs, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:50:52
Ok so you invested a large amount...thought you bought it when it was a $100 just curious if there are many people who ever bought it back then
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:49:32
Thanks for sharing...I feel the process is too long and a lot of work also who know how long I would want to hold it and then I'd have to rollback into regular Ira.
Will just wait for an etf to get approved that way I can buy/sell easily anytime I want.
So for your corporation account what if you want to sell and buy again later is it easy to do so?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:23:45
So you can basically trade normally as you would outside of an IRA? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:28:17
Can you explain your experience with broad financial? Any issues? Do you own the keys? Are you able to buy/sell anytime?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:39:29
Seems like too much work, then I'd have to move it back to tradition Ira afterwards. I'd rather wait for an ETF where I can buy/sell where I wanted easily.
So for your LLC what if you want to sell and buy back later, are you able to?
Sounds like you have a large position, what is your exit strategy? Most exchanges limit how much you can sell per week. In the event of a crash you wouldn't be able to get out of entire position for months. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:26:57
 when did you first buy? At what price?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:31:35
So did you end up using one of them?  What is your experience with the one you choose?  Broad Financial advertises that you control the keys if that is the case then it seems to be the safer choice.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:48:07
I just wanted to open an account there since they offer ripple buying with fiat. I would then move to my own wallet for long term holding and guess I could convert to BTC when I’m ready to sell if need be. Are you saying even moving off kraken to private wallet you had issues too?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:48:03
True but wouldn't b2x trade higher than bitcoin cash does now? That's still at least $700
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:38:15
401ks are BS! Companies provide them so we can fund our own retirement rather than they fund it for you after working for 30+ years! Such a scam then they penalize you if you want your own damn money early
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:12:22
True. I understand both points but how can we as a community spread bitcoin awareness without risk? We need more people to invest, learn and use as a medium of exchange for it to become a legit currency one day 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:38:21
Long term capital gains are either 0% low income people, 15% average people or 20% rich people so if you sell everything in one year and it puts you above the treshold the max tax you own is 20%.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:05:58
See I told you it’s all noise. No fork after all
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:12:38
Too bad $10 now won’t get much doing this in 2018 would be worth it. Best to buy as much as you can upfront but yeah a few years ago this would of been life changing. I could of easily put in $1k a month for the past 5 years
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:47:28
How can someone sell now? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:34:56
This guy has been spot on with stocks and Now bitcoin, he was bullish during summer before huge rally, last week he became short term cautious and looks like he is right again as correction has started    
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:20:34
I see that’s cool but how could you change the amount? If A gives to B then B uses to pay C amount would likely need to be different 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:28:42
Well said
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:15:05
If you bought in this cheap no reason to sell it’ll never go that low I don’t get it
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:24:53
This is so true! Also when I say bitcoin can reach few hundred thousand they say nothing has ever reached such a price! They just don’t get it, if the cap was 1bil coins and price was $100 instead people think it’s cheap the average person has no understanding of market cap and value, bitcoin is 130 billion market cap do tiny compared to other asset classes yet at $8k people think it’s expensive!
We must educate people I’ve already explained this to people and now they get it

What exchange gives such high withdrawal limits? Also, has your bank asked about these big deposits going back into your account? I’ve heard people here saying their bank accounts were closed after doing several large withdrawals
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:51:29
Lol trying to see if it's better to buy before or after fork, the price of b2x after fork would make my decision, if it's going to be sub-1k than btc could correct that much easily during a correction after fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:35:00
Look how much debt the world is in and they call bitcoin a bubble, idiots!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:34:12
Where are you seeing all these people you mention taking out loans? I recall maybe one or two that were taking 401k loans which is not as bad as it's their own money but never seen anyone saying they are taking a home equity loan here.
Taking a loan can be an ok move it depends on your life, age, etc. younger people who have high salaries can probably take the risk each is a case by case and you can't just say anyone taking a loan is stupid.
And I don't think I've seen many, when that does become the case than I will begin to worry of a bubble. We are still far away from a true mania. 90% of the world has no clue what cryptos are.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:49:49
How is now .15? Isn't it based off current price so it would be closer to .25
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:39:34
Right now all they do is go down until the fork
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:00:17
What is advantage of using opendime to give a gift than just give the person a paper with their private key and address then they can choose what to do? Device seems cool just wanting to know more about it’s possible uses
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:46:09
So you are saying we can expect b2x to trade around $1k after fork?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:44:50
If you are that young I wouldn’t sell it though
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:47:08
I wouldn’t suggest people move all their coins to an exchange so they can split them for them. Avoid the risk and don’t bother with b2x is the better way to go, who know what the exchange will do and keeping all your stash in an exchange even for few days is risky
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:20:36
How safe is this to do? I worry about the risks just for a small amount
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:24:33
So by the time most people can sell it's it's not even worth the effort/risk of selling it?
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:55:28
I’m just saying companies should provide pensions not 401ks. They are too greedy
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:46:02
So this is more for buying/selling things with BTC.  But why is it better than just sending someone the BTC to their wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:05:39
But it would be replaying my b2x from my wallet to my exchange only right? They can’t change the send address so in my case they would replay the btc to exchange is worst case?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:12:47
For those who will only send their coins to an exchange when they want to sell, what’s the risk of no replay protection?
If I send b2x to exchange to sell, someone can replay the same transaction so my bt1 would be sent to exchange too?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:06:40
Just imagine when the govt gets hacked and now people know where you live and how much bitcoin you have!
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:40
Got it. This is very creative
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:20:35
People follow their predictions it traded exactly to their last target before correcting 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:09:30
So only risk is if the exchange some how takes it instead of showing it in your account. Might be best to do nothing st all. Are you planning to attempt to dump your b2x or just forget about it?
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:35:10
That’s not that old and if you don’t need the money why sell Now? We haven’t gone mainstream yet plenty of up side potential for years to come
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:29:47
The thing is if you yourself aren’t invested why would anyone listen to you. It’s a hard spot to be in you want to educate people but not draw risk to yourself
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:11:39
Yes it's a useless number. Half probably opened an account doesn't mean they intend to buy now. Many won't get verified or be able to deposit fiat to use for months. Even those that buy are probably buying trivial amounts. Meaningless numbers the media keeps talking about!
When Wall Street gets access to btc that is when the real big money will inflate this bubble big time, we are getting closer but no where near that
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:12:29
It’s a Toyota not a lambo lol he probably doesn’t have a big stash. There is a risk of advertising or talking about bitcoin but then again we need to make people aware or curious about it for it to keep growing
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:56:36
This is awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:48:42
Do you recall what bitcoin cash futures traded for 1 week before its fork?
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:05:04
It’s gone up this year without Wall Street whales. Next year the whales are joining it could be greater than 10x
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:04:11
What do you mean split? If you have your coins in your own wallet you get both coins on both blockchains no need to do anything except move b2c to an exchange later if you want to sell it
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:59:10
The Wall Street whales are coming! Dips will be very brief and shallow from here on out.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:53:01
They don’t support BTG yet
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:11:35
I get it man but look at all the waste execs and bigwigs cost companies! The travel, dinners, expense accounts, etc. while the people who do the real work that generates revenue are cut short. Corporate America is shit and as soon as I can I’m getting out.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:28:24
Yes but you have to wait for them to support it and all the risks associated with leaving on an exchange
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:45:28
Did bth also trade this high on futures before its fork? Even now bitcoin cash is $600-700 I would think b2x would trade higher than that 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:22:54
That’s sick, you could get live quotes through the nav?
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:15:33
It's meaningly all those people may never make a purchase let alone get verified and be able to deposit fiat into thei accounts for months.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:43:37
Fork hasn't happened yet it's around the 16th
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:09:59
He will be wealthy than everyone on here
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:56:48
True but most companies don’t match much so it’s hard to grow. If they were matching the limit $18k a year then I would feel differently about them not to mention vesting periods too, it’s all BS
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:13:15
It’s their own damn greed that puts them in that situation of stress. Anyway I won’t be doing corporate America forever, I’m doing everything I can now to get financial freedom
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:44:11
But why would some try to replay that for? I though only if you send to people they would try to get your other coin?
So it has to be split first then can be sent to exchange to sell? Might not even be worth the trouble/risk to sell b2x probably better to do nothing and hold your btc
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:44:29
Correct if you sold it and are below that income threshold 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:45:16
Any other good services to use to exchange coins? Looking to exchange BTG to BTC
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:14:35
Besides what is the current fee to send BTC from a legacy address to someone versus sending from a segwit address to someone?
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:12:24
I see but the way we get to mass adoption is when transactions can happen quick and very cheap and it’s accepted everywhere credit cards are today. 
I guess I don’t want to touch anything and creating a new wallet and moving coins is just another potential risk to me
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:43:19
How is an ATM anonymous? I read online they require you to put in your drivers license and use phone number, is that not the case for all ATMs?
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:31:17
Ok got it! Thanks man!
So before using any exchange:
1) check the host file modified date and even open it to view it has no entries in it
2) run ping now and write down IP and check each time before logging in to exchange
Anything else or does this cover it?
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:57:20
I heard using ATMs still require your phone numbers and photo ID to use, I thought the whole point of using an ATM was to remain anonymous? Otherwise isn't it cheaper to buy on exchange since fees are less?
Why do people use ATMs? What are advantages over using an exchange?
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:49:17
The whales have yet to load up once it takes off again you’ll know they’re done
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:39:05
What does don't spend coins without splitting them first mean? When the split happens you own both coins and the private key is the same right? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:09:59
Why would someone use this type of ATM to sell back to USD rather than on an exchange?
Because it's faster or are there other reasons?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:27:45
I’d like to know too if anyone withdraw back to their BofA checking account fine recently!
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:58:14
When will the price reach this level though?
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:12:40
How much are the fees now between legacy (non-segwit) wallets? 
Or just sending from a legacy to a segwit?
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:10:29
How is it safe later to sell the losing coin? Or maybe better to just leave and ignore it. Also bitcoin cash turned out to be non event and price went up. You think this too will just be noise?
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:06:23
I’d like to know how high this index was in December does he disclose that?
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:50:25
Anyone using money to buy coins that they need to pay bills at end of month is foolish.
Aside from that I don't see how it's better than using an exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:11:17
The price should be too we are so undervalued right now
@_date: 2018-03-03 06:17:04
For hodlers is there any reason to move from legacy to segwit address? If you are not spending it and just hodling what’s point?
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:05:49
Was about to say this too!
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:41:26
Does anyone know a bitcoin explorer that shows the current USD valise of address to? Ethplorer does it and looking for similar for bitcoin...the ones I've seen only show how many bitcoin you own not the current value
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:55:38
What do you mean unsecured gmail? So someone had to know his password to his gmail to pull this off right? Are you suggesting the email account you use for your exchange should have google Authenticator or similar setup?
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:06:31
These days are numbered
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:08:00
Really, 12 cents are we aren’t mooning!? This market is delusional and manipulated asf!
We should be rallying big time, guess the whales aren’t done loading up yet but I suspect it will be soon 
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:19:36
Ok thanks! This who thing scares me though
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:53:26
So I'm still confused... did he click a link that took him to a phishing site? Or did he go to the correct site and behind scenes it routed him to fake site because he had a virus on pc?
How can one prevent this when dealing on exchanges?
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:47:32
$500k BTC is happiness 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:43:29
Also, I don't get how Bob could send your transaction to the other chain part? Shouldn't there be some mechanism to prevent this?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:43:28
Where can you see 2x futures?
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:06:17
Coin.fyi is great for that
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:31:37
You do need to be verified to buy any meaningful amount.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:42:37
So what's the strategy hold on to both after fork until you see which one is dominate?
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:32:44
I see so when you want to spend coins you have to uninstall and install the app. Seems like a pain and security risk I wouldn’t want to go through anything unnecessary with the device once it’s setup 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:29:34
This is bullish asf!
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:06:40
YOLO!!! Do it if you are young and have a high income job and are smart you can always make money. You cannot go back in time to buy bitcoin sub 10k anymore
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:55:21
Is this fork certain to happen? If so what date? Do you think price will go down before so people who want to buy now wait? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:06:55
This guy had been accurate thus far and I fact he is very conservative with his targets. If he says new highs by July, it’s probably really by April. $25k end of year is probably more like $40k
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:12:32
So then how do you move it to your own wallet?
Seems kind of scary to use as you won't know till after if it really gave you the coins.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:40:54
The only difference I see is with card you won't have to deal with banks
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:50:20
Does google authenticator give the 10 one time use codes? I don't remember that and are those code specific to an app you use authenticator for or is it for any app you have authenticator on?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:28:20
Likely to be just a bunch of noise just like bitcoin cash was, these forks are no good in the long run!
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:58:49
I meant to move it off of exchange to other wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:48:02
So after it sends it you just leaving hoping transaction is confirmed later and you get it?
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:06:24
How does it work though? You basically own same amount of coins on the forked chain and it has same private key as your original coins?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:19:48
Wouldn't it be safer to buy before the fork? This way you own both and can wait it out for which becomes the main bitcoin?  I know you may get a better price after but seems like it would be risky to buy right after the fork
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:49:02
Can you explain the problem of upcoming fork for those not aware?
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:32:59
Then why is everyone making a big deal and spreading fear? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:00:16
What about using transaction volume? I think still looking at number of unique wallets is still valuable even though it’s not a 1:1 ratio to user it still tell us the trend 
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:09:36
What do you mean only 3-4 installed? The device holds your keys so are you saying it can only hold a certain number of keys?
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:54:15
These ATMs seem like a good idea for someone who needs to get say $100 worth of btc to purchase something where seller is asking for btc as form of payment but for investment purposes and people buy large amounts im not so sure.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:37:29
I see. How is that done? I only use my coins for investment so would only be sending it to an exchange to sell. So I would be sending the forked one to an exchange to sell and keep original bitcoin. In this case, is there any risk?
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:58:05
What do you mean how to find it? Doesn't it ask you for your wallet address? It's either there or not
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:24:17
Really does it? Thought I tried that one and it didn't show the USD value of address, I'll look at it again
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:33:20
Yes it does. When it becomes available to buy through your broker e.g. ETF that's when real money will flow in, that's what's needed for btc to skyrocket
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:00:02
So what does this mean? The November forked coin will become the main bitcoin moving forward?
People will own both so any impact to current btc holders?
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:12:09
What is fee for segwig? I have legacy wallet last time paid around $2 fees which I thought was really low
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:08:53
It can be but by that time $1M won’t be worth what it is today
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:07:09
Has anyone used a tenX card already and could share their experience?
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:57:36
What is the max you can purchase at a single time?
So you don't enter any info at all? You just scan your address and put in cash and it sends btc to the address that's it?
Is selling for cash as easy too?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:21:03
How much is the fee on an exchange such as Coinbase to move 1btc? Just curious
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:17:57
I get your point about show resilience for bitcoin but this is no experiment for many who have invested a significant amount into it
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:21:17
Lol, maybe he made a lot and wants to go enjoy his life or take the money into a safer investment since he has a large amount even a 10% return would be pretty good. I'm just wondering what kind of tax % would he pay if he sold all
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:07:44
You are assuming all of those people opened an account got verified and made a purchase. I doubt even half of those have don't do. It's definetly a positive that that many people have an interest but that doesn't mean they made a purchase
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:14:07
But I would only want to send the forked on to sell and get rid of.
This sounds scary e.g.
Coinbase. What does lock time mean? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:16:20
So if you setup authenticator on your email you can remember your own device so you don't need to enter code each time is that correct?
So only anyone trying to access your email from a new device would be asked the code?
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:59:03
Opening accounts doesn't necessarily mean buying cryptos. Also I'd rather know how many are buying a meaningful amount e.g. $10k+ that is more telling than a million people opening accounts, probably half can't get verified or get their deposits into their account, another 1/3 buying $100 worth. This will not impact the price 
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:11:29
What is in this release? Anything big?
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:23:24
How do you sync wife's phone as backup? So here authenticator app codes will work to login to your account?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:49:01
What's that extra tax you speak of?
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:09:38
Thanks! The purpose of using an ATM would be to buy anonymously but if you had to use and exchange to sell later no point. Also I bet the limit is tiny
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:41:16
FOMO - fuck or miss out
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:26:11
Thanks! Sounded like it was already in use being traded lol
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:35:12
I keep mine offline and won't use either until things settle then I'd sell the forked version to buy more btc
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:25:01
Wow this is extreme but very necessary. Most people don't realize the risks that you pointed out. So if the email you use has google authenticator won't that eliminate most of the risk?
Doing what you said may not be feasible for everyone and since I would only put on exchange when I need to sell I wanted to know.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:21:37
How could someone verify that the address (e.g. DNS) is in fact pointing to the real exchange? Please provide steps if you can.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:19:49
So if I wanted to buy more original bitcoin after the fork I couldn't use any of those listed exchanges that support 2x since I wouldn't get the original? Is that correct? So I'd have to buy it before the fork and move it over. So these exchanges won't support buying the original bitcoin anymore after fork?
I was thinking of buying more after if price goes down sounds like I can only buy before though
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:22:57
Agreed, that's why I don't care about this number of people opening accounts. When it's available through an ETF the Wall Street whales will buy in, people with hundreds of thousands to invest. People on here buying $100 won't drive the price higher. The next big push higher will come from hedge funds, Wall Street whales, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:32:54
I wouldn't store the entire thing in a bank...maybe half across 2 different ones or keep half with you other half words at bank 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:04:32
But how can people be safe when using an exchange? I know don't keep money there but at some point you need to sell so have to put on exchange 
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:06:28
You are still relying on a 3rd party (wallet provider) to send your coins to the lightning network. Monero is still young give it time it’s where BTC was 5 years ago more infrastructure will be build, there is a huge need for privacy so it will happen
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:45:47
Ah ok so these are exchanges only that do that
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:19:58
Why would you keep your seed in a bank? The device is safe there since you still need a password but any corrupt employee who accesses your bank box can use the seed!
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:15:28
So they can do this for only post fork transaction only right and not pre-fork?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:34:03
Don't trust no one not them either
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:34:04
What does that mean? They allow you to withdraw for purchases, are you saying they will stop deposits from coming into your account from a crypto exchange?
I haven't sold or withdrawn anything yet so I have no experience to share about this
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:38:58
Is there a place where this guy posts all his videos? I want to go back and start watching from the beginning? I recently watched the one about money as a system of control, it was right on!
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:01:10
You have to keep it there if you are trading. It was USD I understand keep coins offline but are you suggesting each time you sell withdraw back to bank account then later purchase again through bank account?
I though exchanges insure the USD wallet but would be hard to prove what happened here
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:18:54
There's some blockchain alsysis site that can show this info I remember someone here posting about it. It's probably true that a very small percentage of wallets in existence hold &gt; 1btc 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:01:38
Oh ok thought this was about the seg 2  fork. Regarding that fork what's the outlook now?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:36:46
Nobody is saying for him to withdraw 1 mill. Why not withdraw 20k at a time and see how it works. There's no reason a bank should deny it, if they saw you take it out to an exchange and now it's coming back in from an exchange that's pretty legit
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:06:24
If they are filthy rich why aren't they investing more? 5% of their net worth is good to start then build up to 15-20% is what I would do
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:51:14
I'm concerned how this is going to impact BTC price? Seems like all this noise and fear will sink the price then this will turn out to be a nonevent like bitcoin cash was and price makes new highs. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:08:37
I understand to move bitcoin to own wallet. But with GTBC, how will this impact price? They would own both coins on both networks so similar to the cash with bitcoin cash thus increased the NAV value. Do you expect the same to happen in this case too?
Is it just safer to sell all GTBC prior and wait? I did that prior to bitcoin cash and it cost me severally as price skyrocketed and I had to re-buy several hundred dollars higher!
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:46:59
Why do you have to move the fork coin to another address? I heard after forks it's dangerous since other blockchsin can replay your transactions? Is that true?

YOLO!!! The worst thing that can happen is you'll continue being a corporate slave the rest of your life working for someone else.  Go all in, don't 2nd guess it and hold for long term until you have financial freedom.

How come some addresses on that list have info such as "exchange cold wallet", etc. 
Do these people want to identify themselves? Most addresses don't have any other info showing except the addresses itself

Due to its nature smart people don’t disclose/discuss owning it, keep that in mind. Those who do get themselves in trouble, so it’s really hard to gauge what percent of people own crypto

Why not just exchange it to a privacy coin like monero? Then spend it?

It’s also good for regular brokers too because their are no weekly/monthly buy/sell limits. In seconds you can invest any amount you want and not worry about storage

Ok but how could this impact current btc holders?
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:29:57
So you're saying the new forked coin is going to be around $1000 per coin when it comes out based on futures? How would that not impact the price of BTC? Basically it's like govt printing money so everyone gets free money! What is the date of this fork?

Selling on an exchange and withdrawing has lower fees. Not sure why using a card is of any value unless there's something we don't know

Thanks. So If she also had an exchange account both hers and mine can be hooked up to same authenticator code?

Seems like everyone is saying the 2x coin will not be able to over take the original btc so why are exchanges supporting it as the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:27:27
What's stored on it doesn't matter so much I would store any large amount and would add more as I go. Just wondering why people would use this versus selling and depositing back to their bank.
There's no tax benefit either if they can trace your initial purchase to you that's all they need to tax you
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:29:15
I think the price will go much higher. We don't know where he lives maybe what he has is enough to live off or maybe it's not enough to even get by. But if the guy made 100x his investment it may be a good idea for him to cash out. Everyone has their level that they would cash out, what's yours?

But how did someone accessing his email get them into his exchange account? He had google authenticator didn't he? Just trying to get details and histakes mistakes to learn from
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:59:09
So how can we buy the original btc after the fork? Do we know if major exchanges will allow this?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:42:50
So does this mean I can still buy btc after the fork with no issue? Or are people just going to buy before in case there are issues or exchanges like this one closed for few days after fork?
I don't really care to get the forked coin (free coins), care more about getting good price to buy.
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:07:02
No way bitcoin sees a 500% increase post ETF approval, anything less than 1000% would be shocking and that could be within 12 months after approval

Ok got it. You mentioned google gives one time code if you loss your code? How do they send that to you? Also saw some exchanges do that defeating the purpose of this security as an actor can do this to gain access to

Is it possible to create a new email to use for exchange only? Then you can setup authenticator on that too.
I mean I already have an exchange account and I just want to change the email associated with it?

So this 3.8% is on investment income only and not ordinary income?
What state and local taxes? This is no different than stock market gains. Are you saying over a certain amount and state taxes apply to?
So in theory of he cashed out all what percentage of tax would he pay? 40%? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:16:09
But can I change the email associated with my exchange account afterwards? I don't want to open a new account all over

After a 65% crash we are closer to the start of a new bull market then anything. It could of dropped 80% from Top it didn’t but does it matter? The bigger risk is not getting in and missing the next bull run that will take it above $100k so buying at $7k rather than hoping for $4k or lower is not worth it. Based on sentiment and strong support around $6500 it appears the bottom is already in. Anyways good luck
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:48:54
Well done!

You sound very risk averse if that is the case this is the wrong market for you. Institutional money will take us to $100k and beyond not millennials on Reddit buy $100 worth

Sounds like you didn’t buy the big crash and missed it. Just buy now better late then never. A useless post like this won’t cause anyone to sell lol. The bear market is over, but now or watch from the sidelines!

Don’t let the premium stop you, keep in mind you are buying at a premium and selling at a premium.
By the time an etf is approved you could of held for 500% or more even if premium went to 0% which is Wong I think it will always have 5-10% because of convinenance factor.
Not to mention if etf is approved it will bring in a ton of new money driving BTC to double in weeks thus even if premium goes to zero you’ll still be way ahead.
I don’t let the premium bother me still a great investment!

You can sell and move to USD wallet if you are planning to buy back after next week.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:11:48
It is NOT fdic insured! Only USD wallet is, it's only 1 coin but if you buy more best to move to cold wallet 
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:56:36
You are correct it trades at a premium because of supply/demand.  For most invenstors, buying bitcoins directly is not easy, verification process takes forever.  Also for those investing large amounts, there are buy/sell weekly limits so for these people this GBTC fund is the only way to get exposure.  The premium will remain until 1 or 2 things happen, either it's easier for the average person to invest (large amounts included) in bitcoin or there is a bitcoin ETF approved.  There likely won't be any ETF approved for at least a year so the premium here will remain.  Although it can fluctuate based on investor demand.
With that said, I can see a scenario where this fund goes up after Aug. 1st, since there will be lots of volatility many exchanges will be offline and in the event of a split they will be offline for days possibly so this fund would be the only way to trade the news.  I also think it's risky if there is a split, one coin will go up while other goes down as people trade out of the less in favor coin and how would this trust be able to trade out of such a large quanity especially with exchanges having closlures and delay, etc. due to high volume they clearly can't handle.
Any other thoughts anyone?
