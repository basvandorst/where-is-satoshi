Weak hands?

Agreed. I feel horrible for those who were scammed by this. Yet when I heard this part of me, deep down, was shaking my head and grinning. Whoever came up with the scam was pretty clever.  People are dumb and I’m shocked more haven’t fallen for it. 
It’s like when you get a spam email that’s good enough to get you to look at the subject and then open it (like 1 in 5,000). You think “screw you for sending me spam!” and silently “congratulations for fooling me, bastard”.

YES!!! Once again my last-minute Christmas shopping strategy has paid off. ����

So there with you. 
“Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?”
“It’s been 10 whole minutes, wtf. Are we there yet?”

I bought a little stash back in 2013 because I loved the concept. I didn’t put in anything I couldn’t afford to lose and didn’t stress about the price. My thought was “hodl until this is life altering”. I pretty much forgot about it (best way to hodl) until a few months ago.
It was rocket science to get it out of unsupported wallets from an old computer that had been sitting in the garage for years with hardware problems and I was too lazy to throw it away. 
Suddenly I have been feeling pretty smart. *cough* lucky *cough*, talking about nothing but crypto to my wife and pretty much driving her crazy with it all. 
So last night I’m on the phone with one of my bitcoin buddies and we’re both crying over TradingView wondering when the pain will end.  I was hodling but mildly terrified. Keep in mind I had been happily oblivious to the MtGox fiasco and other major bumps in the road. 
I look over into the kitchen and ask my wife what she’s doing on her phone. “What do you think I’m doing? I just spent $3k on bitcoin!” Wtf?! I didn’t even know she knew how to do that!
Clearly my crypto preaching had a greater affect on her than it did on me. Here’s to our wives (or husbands) who put up with us through this crazy phase of life!
