As I understood, they allowed it but would take many down. This is a new acceptance. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 16:20:18
Never had an issue... I would email them. The customer support is great.

If you were educated in Bitcoin, youd know how to spell the protocol correctly, the difference between "Bitcoin" and "bitcoins" as well as what a miner will output. Dont come on here and ask questions, do research from bitcointalk, weusecoins, etc. as these sites have answers to anything you asked; you and every other "iz it worth it" post need to stop acting as though you have a new perspective or difference. At this point, but miner shares or buy bitcoins and hold. You will NOT make a profit mining GPU when ASICS roll out, or at least not a good one. A hobby that is for fun and looses you money for nothing isnt a good one. 
tl;dr: do your fucking research and dont act like you have a special case. 
P.S sorry for being harsh.

Its worth looking into retrieval programs to see if the wallet file can be found on your drive. Its very possible that its still there somewhere even if your formatted it
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:00:35
No worries, I totally get and agree that it is frustrating, but they have always pulled through for me, you will probably get whitelisted for all future transactions. Good luck!

USA here
I love coinbase, never had an issue that wasnt my error and wasnt resolved in a few hours. They also just got a huge investment (5mill) to expand, etc. so expect bigger things soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:52:34
I know, I just couldnt help myself
@_date: 2013-08-20 16:20:09
I dont know how else to explain it; I hope someone more experienced than myself can help. Information on certain things is lacking yes, but there is lots on others.  
Most people dont really care anyways and will always buy more because its better than huge credit and bank fees and a nosy government sticking their hand everywhere.

Well not to be a dick... But its all on you. This is why everyone should make SURE it is the correct address before confirming. 
You can email support for the company but i dont think they will do anything. I hope this wasnt more than you could afford to loose, it sucks either way.

Yes but I find havelock the easiest to use. btctc is another one, as well as bitfunder. 
On havelock you can buy AM100 shares. Which is 1/100 of a "real" ASICM share in the company. Pays out weekly and you can look back at past weeks/trading. Its about 0.04btc per share so you can buy as many as youd like, 0.5 is what I used the first time and have since put many more in. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 15:00:38
No problem, pm me if you need anything else
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:30:06
You didnt loose $800. You lost whatever you bought in for. Itll be okay in the long run and remember, if you get back in now and bitcoins are worth &gt;$10k down the road, $350 per coin now is super cheap. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 12:52:29
Hope that Bitfunder and Havelock dont soon follow the same path, this does not bode well at...

Put it into a mining stock or XBOND and
Keep it there for awhile since XBOND is the same payment daily and TAT will buyback at above the IPO price if he ever does.

Exactly. His comment about it didnt even make sense; I hate fucking ignorant people. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 22:05:29
But for Bitcoin its the opposite. It is made to be deflationary, however, if there was a threat from another coin that was serious, Im sure the devs would make a few quick changes and it could fight off the "attack" 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:50:27
Has anyone tried this? Looks pretty cool 
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:52:31
Thats really weird I wouldnt think the setups would be that different. Oh well, I loved googles app until that happened. It wouldnt have been so upsetting had I had to contact havelocks people and go through a quick reset process (I lost two days of trading in which I could have made a few thousand)

You might also try looking for the same question  on bitcointalk and weusecoin.com
@_date: 2013-07-30 22:17:09
You should just buy coins with that amount and invest in mining via stock, with that amount of coin you could get some sweet dividends in just ONE week, sell the shares and make a great profit and reinvest elsewhere or use the dividends over a period of time for a different mining company if you want your own miner. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 23:44:16
Try  They have a checkout-pay with bitcoin button and can convert coin for you into your bank account 
@_date: 2013-05-24 13:16:50
Yeah sorry I was a huge dick. If you want a real opinion though, buy shares in a ASIC miner. You can sell the shares when the price goes up and get weekly or monthly dividends, depending on if you get 1/100 shares (cheaper, each equals 1/100 of a real share) or buy single more expensive full shares. At this point having your own GPU rig will not be worth it in a few months, you wont get your money back. Even buying a ASIC miner for your own use wont be shipped until late this year.

@_date: 2013-08-02 17:41:05
You can also play around with stocks with small amounts of bitcoin! Use an exchange such as  and you can start getting dividends weekly or monthly :) a great way to start and earn without your own pricey hardware/setup. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:01:41
I dont think we will see many people stop using due to a short period of increased transaction times because in all reality most bitcoins are still used online not in a restaurant/store type setting and even if you are using in that way, if you paid with a credit card you might end up waiting awhile anyways after your meal to talk. Not a HUGE deal because it will be fixed by the next difficulty adj. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:57:04
Which one?
@_date: 2013-08-06 23:18:11
Any chance you can list on Havelock or another exchange as well? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:19:23
Then they should read up more and see the hundreds of sites/people saying back your wallet up. It isnt that hard nor tech savoy knowledge required.

I hardly call one click "less". I liked the ease and organization of Authy much more than google. Are you on iOS? 
@_date: 2013-08-20 06:07:22
Well what I do is constantly check bitcointalk forums and check hash rates for mining companies. Based upon that I try to predict how I think the market will react (i.e HIM fund had new SC single miners on order so when the asset price tank I bought them up and now they are back up again and will rise as more arrive). Its all based on the majority of peoples reactions and thankfully many people are weak handed and stupid. 
Its also kind of hard to explain to an "outsider". Is there a reason you dont want to invest? Even 1-5 coins? You can just hold them and youd kick yourself for not doing it if the value skyrockets when it goes mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 12:17:09

What idiot keeps that kind of money just locked away and doesnt bother to check on "2fa updates". 
He knew all about extra security features and didnt bother to take the 20 seconds to set it up. I stopped feeling sorry after the third story like this. A fool and his money are soon parted. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:25:03
And imagine in the future if each business owned a singer decent miner, running just to secure the network and perhaps do in house transactions to increase speed. The network strength would be immense.

You are over reacting. Coinbase has super good customer support for a, give them a shout and usually they will push the order even if it says cancelled or whitelist you for future orders. Stop fucking complaining.

I still dont see how ANYONE is buying from this company  a fool and his money are soon parted. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:37:22
Well. 10k x a large amount of people who were in on it...
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:20:03
I think it was just the security factor; but this still doesnt belong here. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:01:46
Im sorry you feel that way. Bitcointalk is a great resource and if you stay around it will be much more useful to you. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:48:02
No clue. I didnt ask it to and it screwed me over because it took them off the web version too. What did you like better about it than Authy

@_date: 2013-08-16 00:10:01
Same thing happened to me a month ago dude. It blows because google doesnt care about that app, lots of people have reported it.

What proof would you like? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:48:09
Yup, i got them at the bottom of the drop too. And was charged $192.  It is what it is. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:23:46
It would depend on price and which exchange you listed it on. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:04:28
Buy up some miner shares thursday after dividends are paid out and sell tuesdays when the price is high = small but noticeable profit. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 19:32:05
What about people who leave random tips on other threads? Are we telling them not to do that as well? I really dont see why people arent open to sharing like I was. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:57:01
Speaking of your site; love the products man, as soon as I get some more liquid coins I'll be placing another order for friends and family :)

Invest in a mining rig or buy shares in an ASIC
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:48:59
So glad this is happening again. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:53:09
Yup, I can see how that would suck. But before "buying" into it, people, especially ones who joined on the major rise, should have only put in what they could afford to lose, even if it was to use as a currency not an investment. Quick fact: longterm, bitcoin prices will go back up. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 21:06:25
Just relax too, itll get fixed. And its not like they didnt refund your money so its not like you lost anything. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:36:11
Nope, it just shows a BUNCH of random emails sending me coins... like 0.000012. Hopefully is a bug, I dont have more in than I can lose, but it still sucks/made my heart stop
@_date: 2013-07-31 19:59:49
That is because coinbase works on a bank withdrawal, which can take some time. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:13:02
Great, thanks :)  
@_date: 2013-08-13 21:31:48
But what people still arent taking into account is that TRANSACTION values will be greater when more people adapt, making mining still worth it, perhaps more so than finding "new" bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:43:30
True, i may underestimate their wrath. But i think it is a possibility, not a big one, but an idea, that my "vision" could work out...maybe. Itd take a lot of balls to even try though.

Dont know what the fuss is about, if all exchanges go belly up due to regulation than  the order books can be converted into "direct" shares for most assets....
@_date: 2013-08-17 03:19:25
Yeah. Stay FAR FAR away from BFL. Honestly you are more likely to make profit from buying and holding a mining stock and earning split divd with other shareholders. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 06:38:01
Oops sorry! A lot of new people ask this type of question and im used to just jumping right in to a toned down explanation; my apologies. 
When I was talking about hash rate; I was referring to speculation on companies that mine bitcoins and then pay you those mined bitcoins based on how many shares you hold. ASICM is a leader in this field and pays stable weekly divid of ~0.02 coins a share. You can also buy many new IPO companies who promise to deliver better specs, hardware etc. its all a guessing game at that point because many companies face huge delays and fail, loosing people coin. However, with proper understanding and when a reliable/known person is starting a new one; it often is a success and early IPO buyers can turn a HUGE profit. 
I dont do much pure coin price speculation but again, by watching world news updates/bans etc on the system I judge where the price will go and hold until I want to cash out. So far whenever it drops below $100 it has always gone back up, even if it takes awhile so Ill buy more at $60-80 and flip and $100 or put them into new stocks, as i previously mentioned. 
If you do want to invest, you can buy a share in XBOND on  that pays a daily return of 0.00000050. Its great because owning it also gives you early IPO access for future TAT offerings, which should drive the price up. AM100 is another stable one as well and is the only company to live up to their promises. AM100= 1/100 of a AM1 share but works the same way just 1/100 0f the price/divd. Easier to trade play around with being $3.13 than &lt;$300 (AM1 price) 
Why do you consider it a gamble? Isnt that what any investment is? Nobody, even in regulated, fiat markets can FOR SURE say whats going to happen and we see a rise/fall for stocks, money worth etc every day. Im not sure how else to explain how to size up the market other than to go on bitcointalk forums and read threads/talk about upcoming news and reactions based on that knowledge. 
Disclaimer: I own stock and like any advice take precautions, even if you are just wanting to learn more. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:17:20
Miners will certainly petition for that to change when theres a significant influx.

Its just vertically integrated. Its a proven successful method and if maximizing profit and creating (to be frank) the easiest smartphone OS to use than I dont know what is "good". Android is great to tinker with settings, but if you just want it to work and be able to access your data, etc then Apple is great. Just because it doesnt fit your needs doesnt make it "evil" 
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:31:13
Welcome! Check the sidebar and weusecoins.com. I would recommend  for buying as it can act as a wallet without user setup and is very upfront and has great support if you need them.

Im gonna get hate for saying this, but the app does violate the TOS for devs. Its not because it was a bitcoin related app. They can revise it and im sure apple will add it back in, plus if you already have it downloaded it doesnt "go away"

Heres your answer.  Dont base USD price on mt gox. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:31:02
You didnt lose any money if they cancelled your order. The money would go back to your bank account and if you had emailed them they would have pushed the order and you would have gotten the amount of bitcoins you ordered for market value when you ordered them.

They really need to get their shit together, its time to step it up. no more allowing the same account to buy a ton at once/in a row (like coinbase) and fix the servers, if that means storing them on Amazon, do it, but buy double whatever they think its going to take. Honestly nobody knows where the final price is going to be so we just need to let it ride, relax people. Im in this for the long haul and if you put more in than you could afford to lose im not feeling bad for you. Its not supposed to be a way to make a quick buck, get off if that why youre here.

@_date: 2013-04-14 03:51:50
Same here. And, unlike some other exchanges, the customer support, in my dealing with them, is very good. My first purchase was deemed "high risk" and a sent an email asking why, they then sent me an email apologizing, and credited my account with the previous market price (it was 22-45USD difference when I could email them/received bitcoins)
tl;dr :Never had problems, good service. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:21:22
Yes. I do, it could possibly bring in more money if you took a percent of the trade, etc.

First off, I dont mean to be rude, but at least use the search bar, tons of people ask this same question and while I dont mind sharing info, its kind of annoying after a bit of it. 
Second, you obviously havent done much research because you would know the answer by now that mining isnt going to be profitable unless you had the product yesterday and every day that goes by your ROI goes down. That being said, you can still make some money on it; IF you plan right. I would suggest buying or working for bitcoins, is great. After you have a few coins you are willing to loose if it all thanks, I would invest in some mining shares that pay you weekly/ monthly dividends like if you were mining yourself but you dont have to do any work. Www.havelockinvestments.com is a great place to do that with. 
Next, if you really still want to mine, go to Those guy will be able to help much more because is supposed to be for sharing of news. 
Hope I helped man, good luck.

Always use 2fa. I find Havelock to be the easiest to do basic stock trading on if I just want to hold and get my dividends. Theres also one on havelock (xbond) that gives out daily divid and has a buyback of 105% the IPO so you cant lose money on it right now.

@_date: 2013-08-15 01:16:44
No. It is unsafe. Nobody ever said it was "safe" and anyone telling you a trading site without 2fa is "safe" even a big one is a liar and an idiot. There ARE risks. Thats the point of being an early (now somewhat) adaptor if the value rises - you could have lost everything. 
Would you have shared a bank account with your room mate? No. Dont get made because you made an uneducated choice with your money. Using bitcoins at this state, or at least holding them should be seen the same as if you lit the cash on fire. You had to be able to afford to loose it. Im sorry im being harsh be literally the sob stories need to end. Im sorry for your loss, but why didnt you read up more instead of just letting money sit around? We are always willing to help with questions; just not help le account hacked! Plz help coins gone.  
Next time use 2FA like EVERYTHING says to and we wont have this issue unless you leave access to the keys out.

Can nobody ever use the search bar, the same questions get asked over and over and over. 
However, mtgox has limited USD withdrawals, so they tend to be a little off of every other exchange, while others base price might be different but with fees for the exchange, not that far apart.

Dont really know what your "Wtf" is for... It cant keep going up forever AND if you were being a smart investor, you would be reading the forms and it was clearly painted to be in n bubble. 
If youve been watching the trend, it tends to go down after a div, not up. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:56:34
I think XBOND is a great one as well, the price is low right now but it should jumps when TAT has a new IPO. Plus the divd is always the same, daily. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 12:45:17
Best explanation so far. Thanks. But where would one go to enter the public address and "speak" the private key. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 13:39:17
A thing a lot of people are doing for a new site is give out a handful of small increments of bitcoins (like 0.02) so the site can be tested and nobody can lose anything that they had w/o the test money. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:50:35
You sound like a great friend, with time it will heal and hopefully you can look back on all the great times you shared. 
 
Now as for the mining products, its sounds to me like what you have are USB miners. I personally have no experience with them, but if you google it or check on bitcointalk there will be guides. I would also repost this under Hope it all works out for you man.

Its the main source man, I dont know what to tell you. The site has been down due to an attack, try again tomorrow. Have you spent four hours on the boards? Have you tried to send someone a PM? All those things need to be done. It is to prevent spamming, not to try and shove you away.

@_date: 2013-05-16 10:52:35
Question, so it shows N/A next to all the dividends; is it never going to pay out again or...?
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:44:37
Im very sorry to hear about your friend. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 00:55:34
I have no clue why they decided to shut down to US customers, my guess is that it was legal advice. 
Direct shares are those controlled by just say one person, without an exchange. So TAT would have on his record the you own x shares of x asset he offers and would pay the dividend to your public wallet, or cold storage. Also you may have voting rights but that would be on asset to asset basis. 
 
PT sites are not illegal. Having a passthrough distributes shares to more people and allows them to be divided up to be cheaper (i.e AM100 on Havelock) 
@_date: 2013-08-07 00:00:33
Sweet, definitely going to pick some of these puppies up :) 
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:01:10

A separate company, several different types of shares you can buy that will then pay weekly/monthly dividends and you can resell whenever you want
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:45:37
Price spikes with good news, itll go down at least a little when the div is low again (maybe not this week, but in coming weeks)
And if im wrong, oh well. Ill get over it. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:42:34
Go on bitcoin talk and read up on the securities child board. It will help you decide where to put your coin if you want to get "stock". You can also just throw it in coinlenders or something of that nature. 
My personal recommendation is AM100 shares on Havelock as they are 1/100 of a real share and thus are cheaper to get into as a beginner, as well as stable weekly divid.

At this point I dont care. It took far to long for a bug fix and frankly confidence has been lost to a better service. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:11:53
And full shares; for other companies too :D
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:11:08
yes, heres my bitcoin address 1PmzHDbCeBWS4Cf6xWKuRHkS7VMKLxvyUe
@_date: 2013-07-13 00:56:35
Yikes, good thing they changed it, not very secure to do haha...
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:43:33
Same here man. But I didnt seem a withdraw email so before I could get on I half hoped someone had mistakenly sent me coins xD 
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:12:47
Is the address on bit-minter your coinbase one? If not log onto coinbase and grab your address from there and put it into bitminter.  Sorry im confused -_-  
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:16:46
I can vouch, this was a really co experiment; especially because nobody ran off with the coins and they were donated to charity :) 
@_date: 2013-07-10 18:44:51
How can everyone win...
@_date: 2013-08-17 19:17:02
How much does one creature count for? 
One block? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:17
Thats exactly how it works. The only downside to coinbase is that it takes a few days to get your coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:48:34
Used more than one :/ ^(again)
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:53:28

@_date: 2013-10-16 13:22:32
Id love to see the design when youre done! 
@_date: 2013-08-01 11:50:25
A transaction was made. There is nothing we can do. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 20:47:40
Youll need to re-register. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:21:31
You should consider donating some of your donations to SeansOutpost :) especially since donations are being matched until Monday
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:59:25
And by the time is IS possible, new tech will be developed to counter it. Such is the way of life. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:15:07
Yeah... "Two weeks" hope they deliver
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:01:34
What did they say after you emailed them? When i had a similar issue they just gave me the same amount of coins for the price I would have gotten them at. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:25:57
Well i have both. I got the email for the tat shares, but not real shares. It also shows a lesser payout for my real shares on the funds page. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:19:44
I participated in the first run of this awhile back, it was so beat to watch. And nobody ran off with the coins either. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:35:36
Try asking via PM's on localbitcoin too! 
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:22:06
This get asked a few times a day, the answer doesnt change. It cant take it down. It may slow it, but it can never destroy it. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:33:27
It does, look around
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:28:29
Should still be there, im not to familiar with android backups etc. but since you use the google app it should be accessible via your gmail account-&gt;2fa
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:58:40
Just sold 100 shares, ready to buy back at a lower cost :)
Edit: TAT shares, not full ones. Those I wont sell until 5btc :) 
@_date: 2013-09-14 22:04:53
That doesnt work here. And its getting old. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:23:45
That was my original idea, but I think people should think about donating whatever they could "take" from the release. Or at least some. 
In reality, the coins will most likely sit in an evidence room for quite some time  
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:38:15
There was a article awhile back that said only ~1 million had ever owned any amount of bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:17:39
Thanks for the suggestion! 
Doesnt seem like anyone wants to try it again :/ I forget who organized it the last time, we had a group chat set up. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 16:01:08
Its a bug in the system, same thing happened to me; minus the sending coins elsewhere. Can you post a wallet address? 
@_date: 2013-08-20 00:55:02
Only sound advice: Listen to zero of what people will tell you to do on here. Honestly. The only way youll be able to day trade etc is to learn the ropes yourself. People have only ever gotten lucky and you cant get greedy. When you see a profit that you want, cash out and buy back if/when the price drops. remember to be smart and leave ALL emotion out of it or youll screw yourself over. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:15:24
God damn it was a joke. Obv not a serious post. Calm down. Theres lots of people who post on here so YOU GTFO and go to @_date: 2013-05-19 03:08:12
I totally agree with that, but it is still something, at least conversationally id like to be able to talk about if they, or anyone for that matter brought up. (All theory work/talk, im not advocating hacking and stealing peoples coins just because they didnt secure a wallet well enough)
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:16:39
Nope. Ive only ever used them and only had a few minor issues that have always been resolved or were my own mistake. No complaints besides having to wait for the bank transfer (5 days)
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:12:02
Its not that bad haha, its gotten a lot better in the last few years 
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:19:46
And its more funny because more USD fund wars and the like than bitcoins have and will continue to do so. Media portrayals of bitcoin or any new tech just make me laugh. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:40:49
If you ordered one today youd be sitting in line for a long time to get one and by then the difficulty would be too high to make your money back at a good rate; just buy ASICminer shares from Havelock Investments, sorry dude. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:20:29
I also got the article, read it, and just laughed
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:16:52
Thanks, I just checked and they are back, must have been a bug of some sort; does make me feel bad because ive been telling people to use them all day, Ive never had a real issue with them
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:39:22
Coinbase: Buy bitcoins with fiat 
Havelock: Invest with bitcoins that you already have.  You fund your havelock account with bitcoin and then buy the mining shares. Theres a wide range of choices too (but I still recommend AM100) (because you dont have to put in a large amount to start/ can do as much as you want) 
You can buy from Havelock too, but I like coinbase MUCH more and havelock is with CAD 
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:00:31
Well it was ~$66.50 so more than that:p maybe a full bitcoin, 2 for sure. 10btc and youd be a fool. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:40:28
I don't think the government would hire someone with poor use of grammar...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:13:00
I use coinbase. I know some dont like them but ive never had an issue 
@_date: 2013-06-21 23:17:31
Im down for a hundred shares whenever
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:37:26
Were you planning on selling again right away? What if it had gone through and bitcoin drops 75% next week? Then youd be happy they canceled it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:44:56
No. You dont. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:51:52
Bought a few shares of full ones at 1.2 bitcoins and a few hundred 1/100th at .017. Im making a killing right now; sort of, for a 17 year old kid. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:31:50
I didnt say it would be, but with that mindset why speculate at all. How are you so sure of the future market? 
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:09:11
You say you know a lot about computers and such but didnt have 2FA on? 
2FA= 2 factor auth. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:24:06
Ive never had an issue, at least one that wasnt resolved withen 12 hours and an email.
@_date: 2013-08-03 19:40:02
Still better to not do it all at once right? 
@_date: 2013-07-29 14:36:50
You cant be serious...thats beautiful

They wont know its high risk until later, an email will be sent. If you want, send another. Its a small team. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:55:08
When can i expect the transaction? I wanna make sure im online
@_date: 2013-08-12 00:07:50
Im still not gonna buy any. Worth it to buy shares instead or just hold. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:55:59
You're new to this not being a twat thing, aren't you? 
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:06:34
And coinbase has a feature to do repeat buy/sell based on what parameters you give it (buy $50 a week etc) 
@_date: 2013-04-20 21:02:38
Hey man. Ask them why it was deemed high risk then. Itll get pushed. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:54:34
Labcoin is for sure fishy, but no doubt more than a few people are going to make a killing selling when it opens for full market access. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 13:30:11
Just so you have another starting point, I use  Theres a lot of choices for companies to buy shares in, all bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 03:10:59
Super easy to setup with some basic know how of technology. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:58:00
How much money can you put into BUYING coin without it being a great loss
I would invest in some ASICM shares on Havelock Investments, cheaper to get into than a direct share and still pays dividends. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:12:14
How am I an ass? I dont really get it. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:22:39
Couldnt we even say the all the transactions that got put into a final account with all the coins (for a grand total of 27,350ish) are invalid. 
Edit: downvotes arent for ideas you disagree with, just one that dont add anything/spam. Common, at least reply and say why you guys disagree rather than keep clicking an arrow 
 
Rant over.  
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:16:50
Oh yes; because any currency isnt already used for narco terrorism and drugs and any illegal activity. Fucking christ. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:34:33
With all those "convenience" fees built right in :)

Google auth is shit on mobile. Use Authy. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:42:57
Youd loose money on an order for a miner too, its a risk. Buy on a tuesday night right before a dividend payout day and then sell after if youre that worried
