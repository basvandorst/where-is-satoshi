There have been many beers shared between the Leet team and the Bitquest team…one of them is living across the hall from me right now, even. There may or may not be some interesting collaboration in store for the future ;)
And btw, Bitquest and our Minecraft servers are completely different

Dota2 is on our list of games that we want to support.
@_date: 2015-05-22 01:54:15
Agreed! We will be adding this soon.

Correct! We haven't officially announced it yet. We still consider it in beta, but it does work. We are waiting for a few more days of low volume and testing.

Leet.gg allows gamers to compete for each other's money in existing competitive video games. We're basically bringing the model of online poker to competitive video games, and it's not an honor system; it uses our API to verify kills, deaths, etc.
Lots of players are already buying and selling in-game items, so this feature helps gamers play on our platform when they'd otherwise be intimidated by bitcoin. We continue to make onboarding easier for users. We also have a feature where users can choose to have value on the site denominated in any currency (even though our site uses only bitcoin right now), so it is more intuitive for more users.
And there's also some other cool stuff that we can't talk about yet ;)

Thanks! We think it's the future of competitive gaming.


Our transactions are off-chain, and they do go through us, if that's what you are asking.


Right now, we exclusively use Google accounts. This is for user convenience, and the only thing that we use it for it to grab your email address. When you first are prompted to link your Google account on our site, it will specifically tell you the type of information we are requesting. We could possibly use a different system for accounts in the future, but if it bothers you, you can easily create a separate Google account for use with Leet.

Right now we are building on top of certain games, but ultimately, we are an API that can be integrated into games by the developers themselves. Developers can take a cut of all the transactions that occur in their game, so for them it is a way to simultaneously attract a competitive playerbase and make money. Also, we have some very special partnerships coming up that we are very excited about.

We are off-chain.

Yeah totally!! Many knives even sell for thousands of dollars, but Steam's marketplace has a price cap of $400, so items often can't be sold for their true value there. People will always find a way, though 😏

Yes, you can, and you can also take a cut of all transactions that happen on the server! Email admin with any questions. :)
