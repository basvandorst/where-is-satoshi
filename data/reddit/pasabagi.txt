28 thousand years of human history supported the assumption that humans were animals that wear furs and wander around hunting elk with stone-tip spears.
History isn't really a guide when it comes to what might and might not work. Rational inquiry is.

This is a bit of a strawman. People who want anarchy don't typically want a power vacuum. Most serious anarchists agree with some form of the Foucauldian maxim that power is inescapable. Anarchists want decentralized, non-hierarchical, democratic power structures. That's not a vacuum - it's just a different form of executive. Any anarchist society would have the means to resolve disputes and deal with armed gangs.
If you live with anarchists or work with anarchists, you'll quickly find they have all sorts of mechanisms (often dysfunctional, but still) for dealing with both internal and external conflict. They have power structures, and people in positions of responsibility. The difference is that power is largely subject to discussion, and democratic process.

Sorry, but I really fucking hate videos. It's like a way of stretching three sentences-worth of information into 3 minutes of abrasive noise and ugly sights. Can you precis it for me?

No, it's online video. Especially instruction videos. It's like minutes of my life, destroyed. But I'm also glad I didn't watch your video, as I've heard that point many times.

I don't think that definition works as well as you'd think. Many contemporary societies have forms of 'de-centralized violence' - for instance, in the US, there are conditions under which it's legal to shoot someone. Saying a state is that which has a 'monopoly on violence' is pretty simplistic.

Anarchy just means no kings. There are many kinds of anarchists. But, I think ultra-democratic federalism describes the mainstream.

Dress sense? I guess direct democrats typically want a central government, whereas anarchists want everything as federalized as possible.
