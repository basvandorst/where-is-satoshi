Don't be sad you missed the boat. Go buy champagne to celebrate your 4% increase minus your 2% inflation.

Thank you. I'm really trying to understand all of the problems but even with all the time I spend reading I still can't comprehend everything. For now, I'm following my gut with problems I don't fully understand and my gut tells me to trust Bitcoin Core. :)

But what was wrong with the 2x plan? A small increase of the blocksize to fix the current problems untill the LN is functionable.

Actually, Waldo, he is kinda right. I am a Bitcoin hodler and I believe they will fix the problem and bcash is just going for the easy way out, but currently bitcoin is pretty much useless. Recentaly I wanted to move a bit of bitcoin and I was unable because of the fees. Had to use ETH instead.

He may have coined a phrase, but you should give credits to the original philosopher: Montesquieu.

So in case we go back to the Stone Age, gold has more value. Does this mean that when we do not go back to the Stone Age, which is a slightly bigger possibilty, Bitcoin is superior?

Maybe this is Satoshi's way of showing the community/world that his idea wasn't about money.
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:01:50
Yes, everyone should be proud of [this](

The bear is strong with this one.

The writing style of that website seems way below the level of intelectuality of Satoshi. It seems like the writer is covering his lack of intelligence with some numeric plot twist. It was too cringy to read the whole website though.

I am not an expert on the subject, but I believe the whole Hong Kong situation started when Carrie Lam, president(?) of Hong Kong (and CCP puppet) introduced an extradition law which would take away the freedom of critics (and other political opponents).
But hey, it seems they also sell tin foil hats way over in China.

In my opinion (I am no expert) the Lightning Network is the (new) ray of light for Bitcoin. Bitcoin wasn't ready for the mass adoption last rally. It resulted in high fees and slow transactions, which then resulted in a bad image and eventually the crash. 
The Lightning Network will be able to handle mass adoption IF it is able to function at that big of scale. So if Lightning delivers, I think Bitcoin will thrive as never before. Again, I am no expert. 
I really hope so though, not just for selfish reasons, but also for the future of OUR money. Which currently is in control of central banks.

It is raising really fast lately. I won't be surprised if we'd see a strong decline in the near future. Hopefully I'll have some spare funds when that time comes! :D

You act like a rebellious teenage kid. Let's not hope the entire BCH fanbase is like you.

How does a hacker hack a cryptocurrency? I thought it wasn't vulnerable to these kind of attacks because it is decentralized. I'm only familiar with the concept of a 51% attack and that makes sense to me, but this doesn't..

Thank you. What happened to the subpoena Bitfinex recieved? They should have been busted by now if they were involved in fraud, shouldn't they?
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:18:24
Could someone please ELI5 why this is good news?
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:12:32
The end user will not experience the multiple layers, that's something behind the scenes. You don't have to know how email works to send one, do you?

This may be a stupid question, but as the reward for mining lowers and eventually stops, why would people still mine then? Because that would cost them money, right?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:47:35
I can't seem to find an awnser to this question: Why do people want to stack BTC before the fork? How are they able to benefit from this situation?

Energy consumption, politics, competition, scalability. But you are right, wish instiitution would be as bright as you are, random internet person. I'm done with this argument, you don't have to throw a wall of text.
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:35:59
If that was the case, way more insitutional money would have entered this market. It is still a speculative market with high risk. But if telling otherwise helps you sleep at night, please help yourself.

I went to a Bitcoin ATM the day before yesterday, when the price dropped almost 15 percent. The merchant of the store said to me: "You know Bitcoin just heavily decreased, right?" 
I was thinking to my self yes that is exactly the reason I'm buying..
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:30:58
they rather base their investment on price and emotion
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:30:35
I don't think the mass has time to wait 45 minutes on a confirmation for a cup of coffee.
The scalability problems have to be solved first.

Can bitcoin transaction fees survive another bull run, or do you think it is too soon? I feel like this hype is coming a tad too early
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:04:44
Maybe the latter, yes. Although I don't think smart money will put their capital in untested and unproven alternatives.
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:09:27
I am fully supportive of LN. Although I do not think LN has matured/expended yet to the point where it can handle another bull run. Hopefully I am wrong.

No, the USD is tied to [oil](
