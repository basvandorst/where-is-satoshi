I actually wanted to buy LTC and got this message. Fuck man! Cuomo needs to go
All I want to do is capitalize on this greece situation, as bad as that may sound?

But it keeps going up... LTC reached a low of $6.93 yesterday. A month ago it was over $11. That's a pretty big gap for money to be made

I wish they accepted litecoins too

I've been looking at LTC *because* of x price y time ago. You can't look at a crypto currency without this, but the main thing I look at is x percentage difference from y time ago. At $6.93 it was almost half the value it was a month ago, allowing for double the amount of profit if invested properly. I would say it's harder for BTC to double in profit when it's value is worth so much.

Nothing is guaranteed to go up or down anything. But in the case of LTC it rose almost $1. That's a pretty hefty percentage to not consider investing in

And drawing ฿ is just as easy as Ƀ. The single line and double line can be easily switched out when writing  the symbol by hand, just as it is done for the $. Not to mention, the Ƀ is messing up my line spacing for this reddit comment, where as ฿ is having no problems.

And who do you think will? He's got the most influence with democrats and independents compared to other republican primaries

What about Rand winning the Straw poll 3 years in a row? Only other guy to do that was Reagan

Can anyone explain to me why the secret service busted Silk Road and not the FBI or CIA/NSA?

I'm not new to BTC, but I'm new to trading. What's the best android app for live trading and quick transactions (almost instant)

I'm surprised there are no bitcoin apps on iPhones. There are tons for Android
