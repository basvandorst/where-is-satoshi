The big triumph is when you can pay your bills with BTC. Alas, it needs to stabilize first.

People were warned about MtGox for years. 
Their prices were 10-20% higher than other exchanges for no real reason. So, people took a risk of arbitrage and it failed. Thus ended the lesson.
Plus leaving your funds in a web wallet was always ill advised. You let someone else control your private keys?
The rule was to exchange your coins, and transfer it out. Never, ever, ever leave it there. It isn't a bank.

Highly doubtful. A MtGox failure (which seems imminent whether they allow transfers out or not) will have an effect, but it will not be the end, just another bump in the road.
Keeping coins/money in an exchange was / is a bad idea in my opinion. There are too many unknowns. 
Buy / sell coins, transfer them out, store them yourself of spend them. Don't leave them in an exchange. They're not banks.

I'm not convinced that most Greeks would switch to Bitcoin. Its still hard to use and hard to get. The issue  was the country's debt and **access** to cash. They'll most likely keep less money in the bank and invest in personal safes to store their Euros. 
One would hope though.

Don't underestimate them. They have deep pockets.
Imagine them asking all of their account holders to mine the coin to reduce their credit card debt or to earn "citybucks". Instant Infrastructure. Or, tying the coin DIRECTLY to Visa / Mastercard.
All it would take is a coin clone, big bucks and incentive to mine. They have the ingredients.

This is disturbing (I'm a longtime Coinbase user who does weekly buys). 
Do you have any proof you could provide? A screenshot of the transaction confirmation or an email they sent you to confirm it?

By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. **Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth
Checkout the whitepaper. Its a quick read.

Are there bitcoin exchanges in Turkey? How can Bitcoin buy bread there for a family? Serious question.
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:02:12
Nope. Buy an [ASIC]( or just buy some bitcoins.
PC mining for profit died a few years back.
Stay away from cloud mining. Most, except low paying Genesis Mining, are scams.
Just buy your bitcoins and hodl.

Nope. The difficulty is way too high for that type of mining. You're about 4 years late for GPU mining.
You need something powerful (and expensive) to even come close to ROI. ASICS

I saw that another redditor had a similar concept. How about something for servers and others who recieve tips or fixed priced vendors?  This board is based on the ARM processor and has a touchscreen, programmable buttons and leds and an SD Card Reader. I made a video:   
I attached a battery pack attached to it, but could add a smaller rechargeable option. 
Since its flash mem, it doesn't need an OS to boot, so its instant turn on. I added the touchscreen calibration to see how it works. Its optional. 
What you think? If I go further with it, I'll add higher res graphics and some animation. Also, I could write a routine to read user defined images off and SD card. 
Or, I could whisper "cool", toss it back on the shelf and continue to drink beer.

I've been with them since they opened their doors. I only had a few issues where a purchase was "too risky" or one of my weekly buys just didnt go through. My bank says it had no issues with my account.
I agree with the sentiment though. They need to get their shit together as the audience grows. Else, they will be left behind (see Myspace.com) . Crypto is a harsh mistress.

I dont think Coinbase wants to 'steal' your money.
Something flagged this. A SAR report means they dont have to tell you (by law). Your transactions and financial inputs and outputs are most likely being checked.

What does this have to do with bitcoin? Do they accept it or something?
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:53:48
I agree with you there. Your money , your business. However, the law is the law and Coinbase being a U.S. based company **MUST** follow the law. If there's another safe exchange outside of the U.S. that wont rip you off, I'm listening.

Thanks for doing this. I plan to visit your shop when i'm back in the area.
1) I would explain the benefit to merchants by talking about the elimination of chargebacks, credit card fees, maintaining cash, and how they can be instantly coverted to cash to mitigate risk.
2) I also would talk about security by explaining that its verifiable by an open registry and is a transaction between the customer and you without any bank intervention. Mention that its not illegal and the chairman of the fed said he thought it was innovative.
3) Perhaps this is optional but maybe discuss how bitcoins are created by mining and that there is a limited supply. Only 21 million can be made but each one is divisible  into 100,000 pieces. Lastly , bring out the value of bitcoin by touting some of it's notable purchases such as a exotic car, luxury home.
4) Sound like a pro. Make eye contact. Dont say "why not accept bitcoin" when asked why. Say its a benefit to mechants and safe for consumers. 
Good luck!

It may be a tough act to follow. Bitcoin exchanging is still the wild wild west.
You cant accept credit cards due to chargebacks.
Paypal is in the same boat.
The bitcoin indexes really have no rhyme or reason to them. They vary a bit.
Lastly, lets not forget the threat of the U.S. Government possibly using an arsenal of laws to shut them now at any time. Money Laundering, IRS reporting, financial terrorism [(Yes, this is real)]( Identity theft...etc.
Competition is good, but you might have to err on the conservative side just for security. This could mean that your new solution could be just as slow as coinbase.
