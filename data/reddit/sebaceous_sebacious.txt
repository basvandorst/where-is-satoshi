Not exactly good advice, as if you own an altcoin mining rig, time is money.  Every day I'm not mining into a profitable pool is the same as paying .15 BTC or more.
If I want to gamble on a new altcoin, I'm way better off mining the most profitable flavor of the week and trading for it.

This might have been a good idea with a 1-2% a year inflation rate, but 5% seems like too much.  It could use *some* inflation, but less than that of fiat currency, so that it would still be appealing in comparison to USD.

A thin silver band or some other type of jewelry would be better.

Hashrate in litecoin is 1/1000th of what you get for bitcoin.  A 7970 gets you about 650kh/s.  Your scheme would require spending 20 million dollars on GPUs in order to destroy other people's money.
@_date: 2013-07-21 00:37:49
Wearing rings in my field is discouraged; this wouldn't usually stop me but a lifetime of seeing horrible ring-related accidents makes me hesitate before rebelling.  
Just a thought though; perhaps people nerdy enough to want wearable NFC tags might not be the ring-wearing type.  A pendant version would be much more discreet, and a lightweight gold/silver chain isn't very expensive at all.  
Edit:  For the people who wanted ring gore, it's only a search away.  [The NSFW links are the ones you want.](
