I see. Thank you.

I thought lightening network is linked to it as you are not recording every trade on blockchain just the initial and final balance and hence leading to effective utilization of block. How does Segwit organize the block more efficiently? A 2MB block is a 2MB block no matter unless you just don’t record everything on it as lightening network tends to achieve. Forgive my non tech language.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:25:18
Bitcoin is sleeping.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:31:28
What is the difference between Segwit and lightening network?
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:22:39
I am still waiting on Coinbase to provide bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond access. They took 6 months to give us bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:21:40
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:41:58
What will be tps with lightning full implementation?

Because they are blind and egoistic. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:23:34
Sadly it seems our dominance will be over by end of Q1,
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:47:26
Signatures are confirmation sign offs? What is the impact of taking out signatures?
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:45:00
Congrats. HODL is the best strategy!
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:30:33
Is Segwit output of lighting network?
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:28:32
We will end the year on an unexpected note. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:24:45
$35k per year tax free? Can you please provide reference to this?
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:37:28
Keeps me curious.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:16:27
$1 million.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:26:49
I pulled my bitcoins and now they are in ledger. Hopefully I won’t miss any more forked coins. I assume ledger will provide access when there is enough stability.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:56:04
Bitcoin has been sleeping for a while. No fun. No roller coaster memes.
@_date: 2019-07-21 06:14:29
I believe moon will be surpassing gold’s mcap.

@_date: 2017-12-18 23:51:05
Diversify now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:34:47
I agree. People are now talking and half of them are actually buying as well.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:30:28
People will dump money in BTC to get free coins 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:14:12
Where were your bitcoins at the time of bitcoin cash fork?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:21:45
I see but they do support Segwit addresses right? I don’t mind waiting but just wanted to make sure if I was supposed to send them on legacy address. The weird part is on GDAX transfer tab it’s showing status as complete.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:11:35
What’s 10 mil club? 1.5BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:02:26
I agree. It doesn’t matter if you have them on Segwit or legacy. As far as the forks stabilize, ledger will provide access. Remember bitcoin diamond? No one knows what’s going with that? Al these new forks hence need stabilizing. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:58
20k tonight!
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:47:56
You only pay tax if you sell to USD right?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:08:52
Easily. ~5X.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:30
and we sold this shit coin for $600 back in Aug thinking we made a fortune, FML!
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:52:09
All coins dip at this time. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:11

Trash! Again trying to get public into fear. Shove up your million Mr. 1%.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:05:18
That’s hard to predict. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:01:52
Haha bitcoin is global. Check out global GDP and then redo the math.

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:30
Testing weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:59:38
I have mine on ledger. I am not sure if all of these forks will have a stable mainnet but when they do we will have free money to dump.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:35:27
Oh no! I am just HODLING and sipping coffee. If you are in for long term, forget these ups and downs. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:30:36
Holy forks!
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:22:56
But it’s handled on off chain by both parties, how does it get verified if not on the main blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:55
I guess people want free coins. Remember there are 4 hard forks for BTC between now and Jan.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:29:06
Never leave coins on exchange unless you are a day trader. We should learn from Mt Gox. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:52:01
Damn. That’s risky!
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:39:13
It depends. If you are young and have 15k, I would invest all of it for higher ROI. Because you can always save again. Obviously this is considering there is no immediate need or family responsibility. We are not going to see these numbers again and next time this year, owning single bitcoin will be a privilege.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:30:58
This is bull. You buy BTC/ETH and then buy all other alts via these. Would that mean we pay tax on every BTC to Alt buying? There needs to be specific guidance.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:45:55
Yes. You will be fine 
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:26:31
New ATH this year for sure. My gut says 30k.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:47:49
I got nano. Pretty cool.

@_date: 2017-12-09 14:34:08
I would never trade bitcoin. It is too volatile and no one can time the market. Our hard earned money can go south with one bad decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:10:38
A lot of us will be millionaires..Remember how people thought in mid 2017, I wish I had invested 10k in 2016 and I would have been a millionaire..Same pattern will follow. You spend 10k in 2017 and it will be close to a million in 2022. This is just a speculation but I suspect main stream adoption which will exponentially pump all major coins.
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:02:52
So if they don’t have enough cash to recover their losses, who pays for the differential?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:02:21
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:18:33
We have dropped enough so it doesn’t matter. Sit back and wait. This year is no good.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:06
20k tonight! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:11
Fuck Warren!

@_date: 2017-12-08 11:12:58
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:03:56
Haha 20 FU!
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:03:49
Wait for 30k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:55
I used to waste my time on Facebook now I spend my time researching crypto currencies. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:54:59
I can see it now. All good. Thank you all. Ledger Nano S is sexy!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:57:15
In my case, my wife introduced me to bitcoin back in July and was supportive of getting feet wet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:03:38
OMG, NEO, ARK, NAV
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:53:28
Congrats. I will make the same speech in 2022.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:07:01
I think by 2022, being a millionaire will be a joke..lol just saying..
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:59:44
What’s 95%?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:57:38
We will hit 20k before we end the year.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:43:42
The max we will go is 100,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:09:18
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:58:24
lol 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:12:12
Haha bitcoin daddy is here! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:21
Do not sell your bitcoin. Get back in and forget it for 3 years.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:23:35
100% but I will not buy anymore. I will start saving again just incase this whole thing goes south.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:19:24
Depends on your portfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:16:08
That’s correct. Welcome!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:06:41
You need to own bitcoins at the time of fork. You will be good for upcoming forks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:16
Yeah once it reaches 100k :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:12:32
Bitcoin will be gold 2.0 and the store of value will be unmatched. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:14
What is shorting?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:25:27
It will come.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:17:39
I did that. It doesn’t show any transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:12:48
Segwit off-course as I sent it on Segwit address.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:47:18
I didn’t so I bought a ledger. No private keys, not your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:55:14
Mostly people experience south. Some get lucky and you are one of them. Congrats. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:07:03
Good to know. I will look into it. I am 29 yo. Crypto is my first investment. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:07:04
$7k avg but I have been hit hard by alts. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:55:30
Rather 20X atleast.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:20:09
Can you share some references? 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:50:53
Been buying dips but then it dips again. Every buying dip causes another dip. Fukin dip.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:27:02
I feel you :/
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:07:03
How much is your investment?
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:23:05
2018 is the last year for these prices. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:29:50
What are you doing here then?
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:29:47
lol should have sold at ATH. At this level selling is crazy but good luck.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:22:54
Also those so called TA specialists saying bitcoin will go to 3000, lol.
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:14:21
I say bearish till BAKKT.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:06:03
$100,000 by 2022. I think 20k is easily achievable if we get ETF approved. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:28:19
Hahahaha Voldemort 
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:39:28
Bulls are coming.
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:59:54
What has halving to do with price projection?
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:04:21
I propose WTC.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:59:19
How many bitcoins do you call bigger bag?
@_date: 2018-08-05 22:33:06
Don’t worry. Buy now and people will be jealous of you when this goes to 100k/coin.
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:21:25
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:31:20
lol at the blood of my alts.
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:06:19
I think most bought between 10-15k and few FOMO’ed at 20k.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:37:00
You invested in Dec/Jan?
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:01:07
From today, goodbye to altcoins. Hello BTC!
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:27:06
To my knowledge, mutual funds won’t give you more than 5-10% ROI. Even with compounding, you need significant investment upfront to get to million dollar portfolio. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:52:43
14k mid 2020? That’s an understatement. We both know how crypto markets move. I think we will be touching $50k by then atleast.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:00:38
Grab me my wings braa.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:09:40
Mutual fund growing into millions? Which mutual fund is it lol?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:30:26
Sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:53:04
Yes it is. Look up ledger nano s.
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:49:32
Good work.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:29:25
How much loan?
@_date: 2019-03-16 03:18:32
What does it mean?
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:05:51
No bulls till 2021. Sit back and relax.
@_date: 2019-11-11 02:13:41
What recession? Where are the signs? Last I checked stock market is at ATH.
@_date: 2019-11-02 21:15:56
I made everyone a mimosa. Enjaaaayee!
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:51:16
Bitcoin is 401k on steroids.
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:12:14
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 02:54:40
I don’t think we will see bulls again.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:13:26
lol truth is no one knows shit.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:09:59
3k is the bottom
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:11:05
How does it help bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:20:23
Thanks for the info. Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:28:08
Cash out at $1 mil.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:00:45
Too late to sell
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:23:02
Haha seriously. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:03:10
Because they are scared of it.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:03:07
Not selling until I retire. Period. 1 bitcoin is all I need.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:09:05
Good job accumulating at that price. Just forget about bitcoin until 2020. Global exposure and adoption is increasing. Media is BS and centralized.
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:11:59
I don’t care it goes to zero. I will just hold it till my retirement. I will be either rich or it will be a nice sweet memory. Bdw, $1 million per bitcoin will be enough too lol.
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:39:52
None of these are proof of stake based models as of now. With that kind of investment, you should have atleast one which can generate passive income as platform grows. Just a thought. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:02:11
Remind me of my portfolio last September. Made good and bad decisions. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:23:30
What’s cash app?
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:09:05
I think we are in disbelief.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:35:09
Does it mean people lost $64m in shorting?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:33:10
You should still have more BTC than average here considering you have been in since 2015.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:51:03
Replace SALT with ARK and I will accept your VTC and Civic lol 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:48:17
People are buying NEO.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:07:15
Roger can F off. If BCH takes over, goodbye decentralization and goodbye to crypto from me. I believe this is a temporary fud.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:56:37
I am dumping too.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:09:39
OMG, NEO,ARK now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:02
Worst case scenario. Fly to Vegas. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:49:15
I never sold my BCC post Aug fork.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:29:53
Off course. No one can time the volatility of bitcoin. If you plan to hold long term then buy now. You never know someday you could buy a house with just 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:41:34
They deserve it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:55:50
Welcome to 21m club.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:56:08
What does this meme mean?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:37:00
Millionaire spotted! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:41:45
Because Bitcoin and Bitcoin Segwit2x will have identical blockchains up until the point of the fork, it is possible to send the same transaction on one chain and then “replay” it on the other. This can lead to inadvertently sending both BTC and B2X funds at the same time. In order to prevent this, developers must implement a protection mechanism into their software which prevents replays from occurring.
Bitcoin Segwit2x does not have any built-in replay protection, but Coinbase has implemented our own replay protection system. You can safely send any BTC or B2X from Coinbase without worrying about replays on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:47:10
I wish. The B2X futures crossed 2k which makes me worried. If it gets close to 0.5 BTC, people will get confused what to dump,
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:39:56
Bitcoin is the daddy. All child coins can spread the fud, we don’t care. I just dumped all my BCH and bought back BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:28
Congrats bud! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:51:57
lol you would know by asking him rather pulling it out on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:04:24
You will always have 1 BTC unless you spend it. What impacts is it’s value.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:09:56
All, is there any way I can sweep paper wallet for BCH? Electron cash didn’t work for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:31:15
Dump 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:44:52
You never know. People can dump free coins and buy BTC or they can buy back alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:23:00
Where do you live?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:39:13
I sent mine to GDAX and will dump B2X and buy back BTC and then move BTC back to paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:37:55
Haha seriously? Why are people overly obsessed with bitcoin. Look at the charts and growth of each from beginning of year and see which has made people richer. If you are only invested in bitcoin, good for you but you have no grounds to call others shitcoins. One day one of the shitcoins people are not even aware of will takeover bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:20:53
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:50:14
How? You bought ATH?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:48:03
This is 401k 2.0 for me.I will sell other cryptos once they moon such as OMG, ARK, NEO. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:04:18
Dump B2X as soon as you get a chance!
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:33:19
GDAX. They are offering replay implementation.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:23:22
Send it to GDAX. Sell B2X for more BTC. Transfer BTC back to ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:14:43
I think they said you can trade 4 hours after the fork. Perfect time to dump to maximize profits.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:46:08
How do you justify this? What if people dump B2X and find out a week later that B2X took over? Sorry I have been in crypto for 3M and I am surprised with future value of 2X. BCC and BTG were never valued this much. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:47:06
So why are you here? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:38:36
A lot of people I know are thinking this bubble will burst immensely eventually and refer that smart people like Musk are not disapproving it for nothing. Musk has a impact on lot of people. I wish this changes his perspective someday.

Ok you need to come up with better BS. Unless you are an expert, there are thousands of people coming on this reddit with basic questions and doubts. If you don’t have anything constructive to say, please move on.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:28:10
Just hold. This is pure manipulation. You will enjoy a warm steak in 4 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:17:11
It lets you sweep paper wallet for BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:27:28
You can use GDAX. They will provide conversions B2X to BTC, USD, EURO etc
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:12:47
Aite Aite I will get 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:56
Portion is fine but some people are selling entire stack.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:10:42
Stay tuned for bitcoin diamond.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:29
Dafuq haha what a night!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:22:10
It’s not that bad. All customers funds are put in offline storage. Only 2% funds are in online storage which is FDIC insured upto 250k. As I said, this will be quick dump and then back to paper wallet. By the time wallets will come up with access to B2X coins, the value will already be 3 folds down. People who blame GDAX for BCH should know that they stated to move out your bitcoins before the fork. Their stance is clear and reasonable this time. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:53:08
I think at max it will go to $500,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:38:49
I am joking man.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:41:40
What did you do? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:55:22
It will correct but there is no way it’s a Ponzi scheme. People don’t get it. Wait for 1 trillion mcap. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:01:36
I am already in doubts. B2X futures crossed 2k/coin.

@_date: 2017-11-15 23:11:28
Get a 0%APR credit card. So many deals lasting 21 months. Pay minimum due. 2-3k is not bad even if this goes to 0 which we know it won’t. It is still pending mass adoption which will be exponential in 2018. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:17:54
Look it up. They will revolutionize payment systems and will have their own block chain with plasma implementation projecting 1mil transactions per sec. it’s like ethereum under 10 and bitcoin under 1000.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:36:11
Not significant if you see charts of previous forks but who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:53:13
You forgot bitcoin diamond.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:46:37
Diversify. BTC, ETH, NEO, OMG and LTC @ 20% each. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:16:53
Which one is better? Trezor or Ledger?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:04:14
Ok stop the BS on BCH please. They clearly stated to move your coins off coinbase as there was no intention to support BCC chain. It’s unfair to brush that against B2X where their proposal is quite clear and reasonable and you will have replay protection and can dump B2X in 4 hours post fork. That’s the quickest. The other option is pull it out of exchange, let the dust settle and then dump it once it’s safe and your wallet has integrated B2X recovery tool. I am going with option 1 as it’s the quickest with relatively maximized profit likelihood though risky as B2X is a bitch and who knows what the big corps have planned behind. At the end, do what you want to do.
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:11:32
Only 10x from here lol.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:48:53
Coinbase and GDAX will take care of replay protection if your leave coins on their exchange. People will dump B2X as soon as trading resumes which I assume is 4 hours after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:53:36
They can’t do that. They just got close to their ass being sued because of BCH. If Bitcoin survives, it will stay as BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:27:26
People are dumping BCH. Free money!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:19:51
Bunch of asses manipulating at best.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:40:05
Lol. BTC is going to moon after people dump B2X and buy back BTC. Wait and watch. We are going to 9k within 2 weeks of post fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:07
Massive drop of BCH and BTG
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:10:20
Define young.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:27:21
What a night yesterday was. Best night in crypto for me with 180 swing of emotions every few minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:15:32
4 hours is not bad.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:54:59
BTC: 50%, ETH: 25%, OMG: 12.5%, ARK: 12.5%. The train for OMG and ARK started this year. Grab as much you can. 2018 all 4 listed above will explode. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:55:15
No you will have it regardless but the quickest access to both coins typically happens via exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:24:02
Check hitBTC.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:15:46
Waiting on Coinbase/GDAX to give us access to these.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:48:19
People keep saying this bubble will burst. We are talking about mass adoption here. The awareness of current time is unmatched. Alone in USA, tons of folks are signing up. Media has created its own hype as well (good or bad). Institutional money will flood in. Bitcoin game has just begun and at current rate, we will eat gold cap by 2025. You heard it here.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:46:12
GDAX has implemented their own replay protection system. You can safely send BTC or B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:07:42
GDAX quick and easy!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:59:17
Haha child will become daddy’s dad. Not happening.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:05:16
I bought ledger eventually
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:05:35
Most of the wallets are having a neutral stance and claiming that chain with most accumulated difficulty will be called bitcoin which is not bad.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:45:27
Coinomi is still pending iOS app launch. :/
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:22
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:26:57
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:30:15
I appreciate the comment. I think 70% of the users will dump B2X as soon as they get access.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:39:02
Never seen a day like this in crypto with such swings every other minute 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:09:20
Not selling. Crypto is unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:41:01
No problem. We are just getting started on the road of $6 trillion.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:19:51
Hahahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:25:57
Free money!
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:50:17
The thing is new people are getting into crypto and without experience making poor judgments. It’s not their fault. You need time to settle in this dust. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:10:53
lol we don’t care. We can do it without you. 
@_date: 2019-12-01 05:13:31
What is crazy rich?
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:18:58
I am because I need to dump it to buy BTC but I was not aware of this fork and my bitcoins were on GDAX. Binance has already opened the market for it. I am surprised GDAX has not even provided access to BTG yet either. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:07:28
Check hitBTC B2X value on Blockfolio in USD. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:00:15
YouTube it. bitaddress.org is an easy setup.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:17:31
They said they will take care of replay protection.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:31:35
Yes avoid and wait for this shit to get clear.
@_date: 2019-12-01 05:19:37
I am crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:55:01
We will dump B2X ASAP as it is everything against decentralization. Nothing is stopping BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:33:00
So If small team forks it and calls it B2X and then come next year large primary team comes back with another fork? 
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:19:47
Boost from libra lol joke of the day.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:45:32
Simple. The whole world is buying!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:42:56
Damn. Good for you. Holding since?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:20:27
I wish I hadn’t dumped my BCH too early.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:32:05
I will be dumping B2X on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:31:21
I think people will dump half of their free coins and buy back BTC. Look at BTC chart after BCH fork. People will also take profits and go back to alt coins. BTC will not go down at the time of fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:42:30
Claiming to be improved version but is planned coup of bitcoin legacy and core principles. Dump it ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:34:40
GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:34:46
Check out FAQ. I read it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:26:00
I can tell you 90% of the users will dump B2X. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:01:31
Moon is 1mil. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:59:48
They know this game much better than us. I am putting all my bitcoins there and take my timely profits.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:53
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:28:59
My understanding is they will take care of replay protection. Since they split the coin and provide you conversions to BTC, USD etc you won’t dump BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:20:36
Screw them. There are many others with clear stance. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:39:36
What is 1 million club?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:06:57
Haha. Million dollar decision bro.
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:38:34
What’s the Houston story?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:01:48
The only benefit is that if you limit sell on GDAX you pay zero fee. The interface is user friendly on both platforms. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:39:07
We all do! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:20:12
Haha what a day in crypto 
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:14:14
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:11:20
Not bull run yet. We will start talking once crypto mcap 2X from here. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:22:42
Wish we had sodl.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:38:05
lol what do we care
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:13:40
I agree. I am surprised that crypto to crypto trade is now a taxable event. No trades for me in 2018.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:22:24
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:30:44
See you tomorrow 
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:12:48
I agree. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:00:48
Never sell at a loss no matter if you have to hodl for years. Simple and healthy rule.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:38:41
Good idea, bad script.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:36:40
With global adoption, yes it is. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:23:12
Buy the dip and not the hype.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:02:18
I believe they clearly stated that you will be able to trade 4 hours after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:54:25
What’s BYC?
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:13:46
What’s their new verification req?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:35:59
Never buy into hype. Wait for the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:39:07
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:30:27
Bless your prediction. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:54:21
I will just move it back to paper wallet after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:13:11
Segwit2x has a higher support? Wth...
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:24:08
They will provide integration to recover BTG and then you can send it to any exchange for trading. Same thing happened for BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:43:13
They have listed some on their website. There is not a lot of info. Major wallets haven’t spoken yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:12:35
I should have clarified, I have iOS. Coinomi still hasn’t come up with iOS app. I bet there is no iOS app through which you can sweep paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:03:35
There will be various wallets providing access to both chains post fork. I plan to send my BTC to GDAX for a quick dump of B2X and then export my BTC back to paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:31:36
When I plugged my private key in elect cash, the sweep button was still disabled. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:49:04
Yes. I bought LTC at 90+ and within few weeks it crashed back to 40s. The reason for waiting is simple, everyone is buying BTC to get free BTG and B2X. After the fork, money will flow back to alt coins. I am pretty sure it will correct but how much I don’t know, depends how many people put free money into BTC vs alt coins. At the end, you do your own research. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:32:20
Yes because people will dump their free coins to buy more BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:06:15
Is there a chance B2X will end up with higher hash power?
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:37:23
ETH and DASH.
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:42:01
$5/mo electricity..where do you live man? :/
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:12:31
lol we are better off without you. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:18:47
Holy shit. That day, we will see a total revamp of power.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:21:07
Do you think it’s institutional money or ETF fomo 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:20:48
Haha I like the later statement. I had my BTC on paper wallet and I am still trying to figure out how to claim BCH.I tried electron cash but didn’t work. There is no app to sweep it off paper wallet. Only if I had left my BTC on bittrex, I would have claimed BCH by now and on much higher value than current. To your question, there has been no announcement yet from Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:17:24
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:17:59
What will happen if ETF if delayed on Aug 11? Is this a bull trap?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:57:17
You can go with any popular ones. Bitcoin core, electrum, mycelium, copay etc 
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:55:39
Well if it does, then you are talking about a $100 million/coin.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:57:34
My intention is to ride the pump and dump money back to alts once this starts going down. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:46:03
Thatsy you make sure that you have atleast 1 bitcoin to save your investment to go down the drain entirely. As Charlie says, buy 1 bitcoin and then buy all the shitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:05:05
You can hold your private keys. B2X will come up with wallets and ways to recover via hardware or paper wallet. Sometimes, it takes time for the right tools to come and by that time your free coin loses significant worth. I don’t know why people are so paranoid..They will take care of the split. You dump it within 4 hours and then move your BTC back to hardware or paper wallet. You can also move it to BTC.com wallet. They will provide access to both chains and provide replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:32:34
High risk. I would rather suggest scale it down to 10k and get a CC with 0% APR for 15-21 months. This whole market can go to 0. Remember, we all are early adopters. Evaluate your priorities again. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:33:55
I used WF, no issues. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:21:19
I will be waiting in the 21 million club. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:05:14
Yes. Bitcoin first and then you can choose couple in top 20 as moderate risk and top 50 as high risk.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:23:29
Bittrex. They will take care of the split. No worries. You can move it back to your wallet after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:15:47
Hahahaha hilarious!
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:20:44
If it reaches that, you will be transacting with bitcoin just like your local fiat. I will cash out though for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:27:15
I am planing to move mine to Bittrex this time. I will move it back to paper wallet after claiming BTG.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:14:41
Haha my Empire State. Happiness after a while.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:56:55
You can’t deposit to your coinbase USD wallet from credit card can you?

Those who dumped BCH will regret. It will easily be 1k by 2018.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:32:23
Do you think I should buy BTC and ride this train or is it too late? I am afraid if I buy and shit starts going down lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:48:30
So I need another bitcoin hmm.
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:31:39
My BCH is on paper wallet and I have tried electrum cash but it didn’t work for me. Is there any app or wallet which has the sweep function? I know there are options on android but I got iOS. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:13:55
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:48:58
GDAX will provide access to trading 4 hours after the fork.
@_date: 2018-04-30 01:25:39
Remember the non stop bull to 20k..Those were the days..those were the memes..
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:12:21
Invest today and rejoice 8 years later.

@_date: 2018-12-31 18:07:34
I am thankful for the losses.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:41:45
Why is ETF a huge thing?
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:20:22
Like the insight. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:22:54
