The $2.4 million Coinbase argument is plain ridiculous.  This subreddit has 171k users - and that includes buttcoiners (who, at some point were majority here)
So, REALLY, 2.2M of coinbase users never bothered to learn about bitcoins and register on this subreddit, yet they went through the hoopla of creating account on coinbase?
CMON! Use the (bitcoin) logic :)

BOA and other big banks are robbers - just accept that you are (and we all are) their "bitches".  They can do whatever they want - and there is no one you can complain about them - whether you are right or wrong!  I filed complaint to the office of consumer protection - zero effect!  
Stop using those robbers.  Here is my story with proof, they stole funds and even though they are caught on tape the "system" will not punish them.  Banks own that "system" and you are (and me!) their bitch.

i do not have my own facts, but the story goes the following way.  Paper gold and paper silver are pushing the prices down.  But if you try to buy actual gold and silver in meaningful quantities, it is actually not available on the market.  Which is a problem.  
Major Banks derivative positions went 10 fold from last quarter of 2014, to first quarter of 2015, and remain that way.
Last "fact" which I have no way of checking is that Russian and Chineese are planning to open in september "true" online market for silver and gold with ability to buy physical stuff, and that will shoot the price up like 10 fold.
That's how the story goes.  I have no way to say "yes" or "nah", but it sound convincing if it will happen this way.

I hear you that 1 out of 13 sound "implausible" but not impossible.  But i think the ratio is much higher.  This subreddit includes customers of all (English speaking) exchanges, thus reducing the ratio of Coinbase subscribers even more dramatically. 
The other point, china represents 80% bitcoin volume.  Volume has direct (may be not linear) correlation with customer base. Let's be generous and say US has 40% customers, but 20% trade volume.  Out of 40% US, Coinbase may represent 50% of market, let's say.  That's 20% of all customers world wide.  If I multiply 2.4M * 5, I get 12M users world wide for 14M coins.  We also know that early adopters together hold easily 2M coins or more.  That leaves average ratio of 1 bitcoin per one user world wide. 
This is highly improbable, because of dynamic of community is such that they accumulate.  Given that community is highly affluent, and gets paid more than average, the price of bitcoin should be much higher, if number of engaged owners was in the vicinity of 12M

Ok, but then big four will create another banking crisis.  Then will bail themselves out, and will destroy all the remaining credit unions and you are back in square one.  
And then OP is really screwed.  He cannot get his account at major bank and Credit Unions are out of business anyway!  Sounds like it cannot happen?  Look back into history and check how many of hundreds of small banks were brought down to non existence from 2008.  Big four were bailed out because of "systemic risk" - the hundreds of small banks that did not get bailed out were the problem for "systemic risk"

@_date: 2015-08-09 19:40:47
I hear you and I am sure there are folks like yourself, but they are not vast majority. I would generally guess, they are less than 50% of folks like you.  Let's even say that for every 2 Bitcoiners who did not register, there is one who did.  The numbers are still small - Max 500k.  Not 2.4M as Coinbase alone claims
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:25:44
It does not matter if OP is forthcoming or not.   
1) If OP buys and sells EURO vs. Dollar on FOREX, should his account be closed?  
2) If Bitcoin is Property, then every real estate broker should get money transmitter licence.
3) Since when (e)BOA became the police officer?
There are so many things that are being screwed up, that it does not even matter if OP was doing side business on Localbitcoin.  Why not, and who is here to tell him not to?  It appears that (e)BOA tells him not to!  And that is the big problem!  
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:08:43
Do not waste time suing them! Create catchy anti-advertising videos instead.  Make your story known via social networks.  Tell everyone you have been Grexed! by (e)Boa!
When it comes to bailing bastards out - we all chip in. But then when it comes to us making our select purchases - then they are free to close op's account.  What the hell?!.  How is it not like North Korea?
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:24:29
agreed.  and most are fake probably.
The problem I personally have with it, that coinbase claims they have 2.4M users served.  It seem like "small" stretch of the truth.  But in reality it's a big deal misrepresentation.  Having empty accounts, or accounts with small amount of btc, vs accounts linked to the bank account is a huge difference from investor's prospective.  Their revenue model comes from converting it from fiat to BTC and vs. versa.  And that's where the small problem of stretching starts becoming a big problem of financial lie. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:19:22
That's fine and I get it.  I belong to the same category, where I do not hold my bitcoins on centralized exchange, but have to use them to convert fiat to btc. THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE MATH.
I HAVE HARD TIME TO BELIEVE THAT 2.4M people on coinbase alone created accounts and received service!  Word "SERVICE" translates that 2.4M people were holder or are holders of some kind of value in bitcoins through coinbase alone.
With given price level - I do not believe it!  It's all hype at today's point. There is max 110-150k people worldwide that own meaningful amounts - more than $100.  (Please do not quote number of wallets - I know those stats)

it's a currency war in its full swing.  If bitcoin market is "rashional" (a.k.a. not manipulated) then it is great thing for bitcoin.  Better than Greece debacle.  The price should go up  nicely regardless the type of currency it is traded in. 
However, there are all kinds of evidences that Bitcoin market is easy to manipulate, thus the price swing is anyone's guess.

Yes, I did!  I am not arguing your point!  I am supporting it, but the tone of message is such as if I am trying to counter argue you. I am not!  We are on the same page.  Accounts are fake! 
My very reasonable guesstimate is 2.2M of accounts on Coinbase are fake!  The amazing part is that they got over 100M in funding from venture capital!  
I apploaud getting the funding and building the needed infrastructure - but fascinated by the lack of due diligence on the side of investors!

EDIT: HERE IS MY SHORT ANSWER
EDIT: HERE IS MY LONG ANSWER
I do.  But this subreddit is not the point of this post - simply one of the references.  There are many others.  This one is just most clean one.
It sounds like you believe that coinbase has 2.4M customers, if you add all the customers of all the exchanges they claim - there will be not enough of bitcoins to go around.
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:08:01
I am genuinely curious are you getting paid for writing this, or you truly believe in what you write?
If you getting paid - I get your point, and thank you for advice.  Your wage is well earned.  (Personally I believe you are getting paid).
However, if you are true believer in what you write (which I REALLY doubt), then by your logic, if one agrees to truly atrocious conditions, then it makes it all fine and dandy.
It sounds like such logic then justifies North Korean leader, and other characters around - as long as it is spelled out, and folks agreed - that's fine.
My real question is: since when it became acceptable and legal practice to have customer's money in possession, and act as if you do not have it - for the profit, of course!  This is not business - this is predatory behavior with price tag of $32 billion.
You seem like smart person, and I am sorry for your waste of your productive energy defending crooks banksters!  You will not get sympathy here.
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:25:50
The site claims "2.4 customers served".

I bought at $1,000 and I bought at $200.  I am not worried, because I understand fundamental economic drivers, and fundamental technical concepts :).  Those who don't will remain skeptical till cows come home.  Bitcoin will beat every fiat investment out there for one simple reason - it's liberation from slavery.  
99.9% do not have a slightest clue of how much value is being confiscated from economy via printing (inflation).  Bitcoin offers the system to keep that value in the pockets of value producers.

yep, I am with you.  Coinbase (and all other exchanges) need to be more transparent about what does it mean "an account".

*"As with all things digital, there are a number of concerns to do with security; with the fear of hackers and e’spivs. Imagine a world that has shifted entirely to bitcoin. Would we not live in fear that some ingenious hacker will get the better of Nakamoto’s algorithm and manipulate it to his benefit? Would it be wise for humanity simply to assume that the bitcoin algorithm is un-hackable (especially so in the absence of some authority that can intervene and save the day if something horrible happens to the algorithm)?"*
1) Hacks are much easier and FASTER to fix then flaws of Centralized Authority.
2) History proves time after time - Hacks do not even register on the monitor in terms of Aggregate Stolen Value in comparison to Centralized Authority.
3) Author is technically clueless, and does not understand underlying principles of blockchain technology.  Thus should not be allowed to draw conclusions.
*"Besides, even if the algorithm is safe, there is always the danger of waking up to the realisation that one’s bitcoin stash was e’looted during the night. And if one entrusts one’s stash to some company with better firewalls and computer security, what happens (in the absence of a bitcoin Central Bank) if that company goes broke or simply disappears into the Internet’s darker crevices (with its customers’ bitcoins)?"*
1) Again, Author is clueless about various storage options, and how technology works.
*"First, the bitcoin social economy is bound to be typified by chronic deflation"*
1) Author is economically clueless - simply repeats journalistic nonsense. Inflation is confiscation of value - in Allan Greenspan's own words!
*" Secondly, we have already seen the rise of a bitcoin aristocracy (a term ‘coined’ by Greek blogger  which, besides the issues of distributive justice which it raises, evokes serious fears about the capacity of very few entities or persons to manipulate the currency in a manner that enriches them at the expense of financial instability"*
1) Simply LOL.  Apparently unlimited supply of FIAT by select few is better recipe against "rising Aristocracy".  Dear author! At the very minimum please take the time to read Thomas Picketty.  You will get better economic prospective on what happens with wealth over time that is unsupported by inflow of new wealth (print of fiat - in this discussion).
*"Thus, the available quantity of bitcoins per each unit of goods and services will be falling causing deflation. And why is this a problem? For two reasons: First, because an expected fall in bitcoin prices motivates people with bitcoins to delay, as much as they can, their bitcoin expenditure (why buy something today if it will be cheaper tomorrow?). Secondly, because to the extent that bitcoins are used to buy factors of production that are used to produce goods and services, and assuming that there is some time lag between the purchase of these factors and the delivery of the final product to the bitcoin market, a steady fall in average prices will translate into a constantly shrinking price-cost margin for firms dealing in bitcoins."*
1) This is even more LOL. In example of deflation, how is it one dollar that buys 1 unit of good is different from 50 cents that buys 2 units of goods?  Yet, to get 50 cents one has to work twice as hard under new economic conditions. 
Price is relevant concept and not a deterministic number. Article's "Analysis" is lacking Basic knowledge of calculus :).
BOTTOM LINE - CLUELESS USELESS ARTICLE - NOT WORTH READING!

You are right! Thanks god Bitcoin lost only 52%.  It took 100 years for US to print $800 billion, and only 8 years to print $6 trillion.  Multiply that number by 10 (thanks to fractional reserve rule), subtract 5% compound economic productivity (confiscated by default anyways) and you get the real value when all is done and settled.
If that sounds like "mombo-jumbo", then the short answer is: $1=$0.0000000000001 after the dust settles.
So 52% loss in value today sounds like a gift at 52% discount.

When I buy Bitcoin - I vote with power of my wallet.  I do not care if I lose or get rich - I vote for believe.  If I lose I will die knowing I did what's right.  If I happens to win and become rich because of my stupid believe - I promise to give it back to the society.
If you buy it with the goal to get rich - go back to sock market.  You will find plenty like-minded there.

here is the article, not sure what happened to the link

1) system needs to be more explicit when post is blocked, and should send warning for the very least.
2) legit quality content gets bad carma. Paid Anti-bitcoiners learned flaws of your system and abuse it effectively.
You can keep blaming my bad carma, and change nothing.  This will destroy the sub - just give it a time.

Any other suggestions are welcome! Let's make it happen!
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:15:10
Yes, and this is strange question.  I do not have habit of writing things in which I do not believe.
Mark my word it will happen within less than year.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:14:23
To all naysayers - just watch! It will happen in less than a year from today!
@_date: 2015-04-25 03:11:16
LOL - that is awesome!  You are right - Paul Krugman and his work is ideology -- not a theory.  Even his baby sitter example on money supply does not stand simple criticism - devalue of assets.  It's sad to see how many people get mesmerized by name "PAUL KRUGMAN" and miss simple breaks of logic :)
EDIT: I am certain to get downvote from those who do not have appreciation for the depth of my comment :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:19:49
Sorry I do not follow your comment :). Too abstract for my lil -3 carma mind :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:16:16
ok, then :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:35:08
ouch, one second
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:09:46
Why are you spending time here then?
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:53:41
Lol - here is my fake support!  Sorry I cannot support you, since I already bought 5 bitcoins today :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 05:49:43
What you described is fight for the territory.  Govs want to retain the right to create money out of thin air.  Bitcoin get on the way.  It's a personal choice weather you want sell out to protection with the price tag of inflation, wars, corruption, etc. or if you want to take the risk of being early adopter and fight that war on inflation, corruption, etc.
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:15:32
ok, i did not know that.  Thanks for pointing out.
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:10:34
Great idea!  Occupy Bitcoin day!
@_date: 2015-04-19 05:35:01
Will do, you should do the same :)
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:43:44
Lol ok
@_date: 2015-04-19 05:35:47
Thanks!  Just one of the ideas!  Let's brainstorm more!
@_date: 2015-04-19 05:18:05
And why you do not want simply trade bitcoins and profit from price fluctuation?
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:24:00
I downvoted your comment, as the comment is not related to my question.  Though thank you for pointing out your concern with wording of "all operational aspects". 
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:25:53
thank you for your reply.  This is interesting platform.  I am not sure yet, if i am ready to use it though.  I think this would be good platform for business to consumer products.  My product though is business to business.  I feel at this stage it would be more appropriate to reach out to investors directly, or someone who had done this before at least to find out about the requirements, "standard procedures", etc.

Nonsense re: volume.  This trading pattern is consistent with accumulation phase of algorithmic trading.
@_date: 2015-03-02 02:54:21
Thanks for your reply.  Deep SME in product configuration tools - built it from concept to launch.  Deep SME in complex process flows that incorporate full product life cycle - built from concept to launch.
For blockchain/smart contract framework - we mapped out product life cycle, wireframed it and defined all data access points.  Working on simple prototype right now.
Hope this helps

Charts are nonsense and the tools of manipulating public opinion.  The pattern indicates stealth accumulation phase when supply is limited.  Trading volume does not matter

@_date: 2015-03-02 06:16:13
Thank you! We are looking into them.
