Those bitcoiners should probably remember that you can't pay your taxes in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:13:53


...yes, and?
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:36:45
It's below 10k right now.
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:20:52
So just to clarify, when was early-mid week this week?
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:57:49


Bitcoin ain't over 10k yet.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:58:48

So don't save in USD.
It's still a far better currency than bitcoin, which is currently a speculative asset at most.

Can I pay my taxes with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:34:02
It really doesn't. Why is it important that the debt is paid back?
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:04:21


Why not?

USD is valuable because everyone needs it to pay their taxes. As long as that is true, USD will never be completely without value. (You're also required to take payment in it to satisfy a debt, but that's less important).

Unless you want to rent your bitcoin out (and for some reason I have doubts about anyone here wanting to rent their bitcoin out) there is no possible way to create cash flow with bitcoin.

That's exactly my point.
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:13:07

You can pay your tax obligations with it though.
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:10:53


Okay, so the intrinsic value that it has it will retain.

You're thinking of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:32:10


Which is among the reasons why I don't put money in gold. I don't have any reason to trust that it will retain value except that it has historically, which is never a good reason to do something.

Lending services aren't going anywhere.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:10:09


It makes it easier for you to imagine it, sure.
Nothing that you've said here has any basis in reality. There is literally zero risk of default, because the US can always print more money with which to pay off its creditors. We're never going to pay the debt back and that doesn't matter in the slightest.
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:10:57


I'm not. Reread what I wrote, it's not a long sentence.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:42:40
Bitcoin can't replace cash until the US government lets you pay your taxes in bitcoin.

In USD.
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:13:30
You missed the part where you are required to pay your taxes in USD.
And *less* value is not *no* value.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:33:29


He does, in fact, and by his frame of reference the inherent value of crypto is zero.
If everyone who currently owns crypto decided, today, that they want out, there would be no point in buying crypto. If everyone who owns shares in Coke today decided that they wanted out, there would be reasons to buy into Coke unrelated to the share price and what you might be able to sell it for later.
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:20:52
10k never again, clearly.
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:21:53
They have nothing in stocks, they have nothing in property, they own no bonds, they don't own a car, they don't have a 401k?
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:01:23


You were wrong. Admit it and you'll be much happier.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:59:42


But it has inherent value because you can only pay your taxes in USD, and everyone has to pay taxes. (Federally, I don't care about individual states for this conversation.)
There is a demand for USD which isn't dependent on people just wanting to have it. The same cannot be said of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:18:59


I feel like you missed a few years of bonds having negative real returns. Creditors didn't go anywhere.
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:22:19


Profit doesn't come into it. You said that we'd be at a price point at a specific point in time. We weren't. You were wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:44:55


And you were wrong.
USD has value because people need it in order to gain the experience of not going to prison. Not going to prison has value, and therefore anything which is *required* to gain not going to prison has value. USD is required to avoid going to prison.
This is not a complex equation.


So if the dollar goes to zero the court is going to make you pay infinite money?
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:49:38

Because some people believe that hodling will lead to you having a worse financial position in the future than selling and buying into other financial vehicles.
By hodling, you are basically gambling that the value won't keep dropping. If it starts going up again, you can buy back in; nothing stopping you.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:59:09


You have to pay your taxes in it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:22:47


There is nothing inherent to the system which requires demand to increase. This is where the bubble comes in. You assume demand will exist in the future because demand has existed in the past.

Mises is a fucking fantasist.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:14:45


You're up 4k. Sell and buy into a financial vehicle which is less like gambling.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:47:53
It doesn't matter what price you bought in at. You could have bought in at $0.1, you could have bought in at $19000. If you believe that the price of bitcoin is going to drop over time, or if you believe that you will likely capture more wealth in other financial vehicles than you will in the same period of time with bitcoin, then the correct course of action is to sell bitcoin and buy elsewhere.
Again, it doesn't matter where you bought in. The only thing that matters is what will improve your financial situation now.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:07:16

And if they thought that it would never increase or decrease in value, would they buy in?
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:39:43
You'd best buy more, then.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:11:21
And nobody was using Facebook at the levels that people were using Myspace. Miners will switch if the economic incentives are there. And at some point, mining will have such a low rate of return that they *will* switch.
But that aside, you agree that there *is* inflation of the supply of bitcoin on a structural level, yes? Sure, some bitcoins are lost, but until the cap is hit the supply is increasing. So why, until that cap is hit, should the price be increasing?
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:02:26
That's certainly a wager.
Consider the dot.com crash of 2000.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:42:55
My point isn't that bitcoin will be worthless in the future. I'm just trying to get you to recognise that there is a fundamental difference between bitcoin and stocks as financial vehicles. Bitcoin does not produce value. Stocks represent companies which *do* produce value.
No, you thinking that bitcoin is *valuable* does not mean that it produces *value*. These are two different things. Bitcoin is a means of trade. It does not *make* anything.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:35:53
Facebook is just as much 0s and 1s as the operating system on your computer. Does the operating system on your computer make nothing?
In order to produce value, something needs to be made, or something needs to be transformed. Bitcoin does neither. It's a representation of value but it does not create value. It is inert.

Amazon stock is based on the performance of an actual company that does actual things.
Bitcoin is based on nothing whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:13:09
You think that's an analogous situation?
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:15:52


You can't just compare the two options of "buy" and "don't buy, leave in fiat" and decide that Bitcoin is the best possible option. You also need to consider what happens if you put your money into literally any other financial vehicle over the same period of time.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:14:13


That value is not increasing over time, so why should the price of bitcoin be increasing over time?
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:13:41
The bottom is $0.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:38:56
The blockchain is infinitely replicable. There is limited supply of bitcoin, but not bitcoin2, or bitcoin3, or bitcoin4, or bitcoin+1.
The blockchain is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:12:06
Why the fuck would you tell anyone you care about to buy bitcoin at this point in time?
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:56:17
He might. Or bitcoin may stay at sub2k for the next five decades.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:54:13
How has bitcoin proven itself? Why do you think that people will continue to buy into it?
Because people have bought into it.
That's it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:18:09




You don't need to be able to answer these questions to be able to recognise that it's a bubble any more than someone in 1999 would have needed to peg March 2000 as when everything would come tumbling down to be able to pick the dot com boom as a bubble.
There is no intrinsic value to Bitcoin. It creates *nothing*. It is fueled solely by the idea that people will want to buy it because it is scarceish and anonymous. 


Did you miss the last few months?
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:23:00


If only the record highs had been based on the fundamentals rather than being a bubble.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:56:14


The fact that you need it to pay your taxes.

*from* now *on*, if that helps.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:49:58
Do you rent out bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:07:51


That is the definition of a bubble.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:10:39


@_date: 2018-03-30 10:56:56
Bitcoin being useful as a way to transfer value from one person to another is orthogonal to being useful as a way to *store* value, and the first doesn't depend on the second in any way unless the fluctuations are significant on a minute by minute basis. I don't need to hodl in order to buy bitcoin and transfer it to a second party.
You are betting on Bitcoin being the specific coin that will be used for such use cases as well. If there was an index fund of all cryptocurrencies, I could be persuaded to buy into that, but there's no reason that Bitcoin will be the final winner of this race any more than Myspace was mathematically destined to beat out Facebook.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:38:21


You're thinking of gold, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:52:05
Hence the blind faith required to think that Bitcoin will keep going up.
Amazon shares would have inherent value even if the price went to next to nothing and was guaranteed to stay there forever. Bitcoin, if everyone deserted it, is so many ones and zeroes, producing nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:28:10


For Amazon? No. For btc? Yes.


It does not *create* value. It has no inherent return on investment. There is nothing backing bitcoin but your belief that other people will desire to buy it.
That's blind faith.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:50:31
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:52:37


Not really. I know that it has uses outside of speculative investing, but I have no reason to believe that a correct valuation of those uses would peg bitcoin at anywhere north of $2000. Personally, I don't value bitcoin at more than $1000, but I concede that I could be wrong. 
Either way, this is a classic bubble, and it's nowhere close to being deflated.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:09:24
You think that bitcoin is going to be a thousand times as expensive as it is now at some undetermined point in the future?
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:29:58

@_date: 2018-04-26 12:28:02
The US government is never going to let the banks fail. If the US government is not in a position to save the banks, the internet is not going to continue existing and you would be a fool to continue to hold your wealth in any system which requires it to operate.

He compares it to gambling because *that's what it is.* You are gambling that in the future someone will want to buy it from you for more than it cost you to buy it. That's what speculation is, practically speaking. This isn't slander. He didn't even say that speculation is bad. He just says that crypto isn't an investment, and he's right.

There is nothing inherent to bitcoin which requires that it ever go up in price.

Or in any other financial vehicle, rather than restricting yourself to crypto

Depends on whether you view not being destroyed in two world wars as luck I guess
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:53:19
That doesn't make the comparison not-disingenuous.

Those are benefits, but the cons are enormous. The dollar is of massive benefit to the US government, and there's roughly zero chance they set their house on fire intentionally.

And a significant portion of your income could be HOA fees, which are also to a government.

There is literally nothing to guarantee that it will ever reach 10k again, let alone the ATH.

Yes. And this would be cleared up if you read the article.

It takes shockingly little time to remind you that bitcoin is less of an investment and more of flipping a coin.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:02:25
...yes, and?
Either it's a good idea to buy bitcoin or it's not. Either it's a good idea to sell bitcoin or it's not. If you're going to realise a loss overall by doing what makes sense now, that means that you fucked up in the past and you need to move on.
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:35:48
They're not fundamentals because they don't relate to the function of thing that you're buying and selling; they relate to the buying and selling of the thing. You have more owners of bitcoin, in the same way that you can have more owners of a specific stock. This is technical analysis, not fundamentals.

They also wouldn't compare saving in USD to saving in an index fund, because the comparison is moronic.

It's speculation, because you cannot derive value from the thing itself.
