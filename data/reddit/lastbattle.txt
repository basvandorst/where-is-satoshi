Quite rare, I have done over 10 purchase so far and saving over 1k on mostly electronics/computer hardware. Not an issue for me yet.
Here in my country Singapore, there are only 2 wholesaler on the distribution of goods over to most electronics store. They are a monopoly and they never have an intention to cut their import pricing. The other factor is high rents.
Even with he shipping cost, I can often save 20% to 50% on Amazon relative to local retail store for most of the stuff that I buy. Coupled along with 20% purse discount, it's epic.
Will still continue using purse.

Its an upcoming TV show that'll be aired in Singapore tomorrow. :) Basically they got a bunch of guys from the industry to say about their 'opinion', and then a debate among themselves.
Copy of the reply from 'theony':
This is from a show called Perspectives that runs on Channel NewsAsia. This particular clip is a web-exclusive excerpt. There are a few others at the Perspectives site, here: 
This clip is related to a bitcoin-focussed episode that will air tomorrow, Dec 5, 8pm Singapore time (Singapore is UTC+08:00). Channel NewsAsia has an International live stream, available here:  but I don't know if this particular programme will make it on the international stream.
Singapore viewers who miss it can watch it on catch-up TV on toggle.

-Trusted, trust is a critical component
-Bitcoin is unstable in terms of their value
-Bitcoin doesn't really serve a clear purpose
-Bitcoin is looking to guarantee 'anonymity'
-MasterCard uses electronic cash to combat inefficiencies &amp; create transparent &amp; inclusive financial system (What appeal does cryptocurrency gives when its anonymous by electronifying cash?)
-Innovation is critical to maintain a healthy environment for consumers and consumers (safe, simple, smart)
-85% of the retail transaction of the world is in cash (we are trying to get more people to adopt electronic payments)
-Bitcoin goes against what we establish in our business in the move towards e-Cash. In terms of transparency, security and security
-Cash facilitate anonymity, illegal activity, tax avoidance, &amp; inefficient
-Cryptocurrency is 'manufactured' on anonymous computer &amp; at anonymous location. (** a concern)
-Regulators wants to understand who makes the payment, who receives the payment in order to control the payment. (Bitcoin anonymous = no)

Basically.... the main debate being: 
"Bitcoin is anonymous, and not transparent. MasterCard is a better option :)"
I'll leave to you guys to debate against MasterCard :) Like BTC being 'manufactured'... what about fiat?

Blockchain does not ever store your wallet. What's kept on their servers are encrypted, so I won't be surprised if they want to verify if its indeed sent out from you.

No association with that, yes I am aware of another project on GitHub also named Bitbot.. I'm still considering whether to rename it or not.
Fear not, I've only required the bare min amount of permissions required to run the app on Android (Push notification, internet, prevent screen from locking). This app purely serves as an information based, regarding the market.

To clear things up. 
Remotely hacking the nodes isn't possible with this, to name a few: 
ASLR, DEP, SEHOP, runs with no admin privilege.
as long as you do the necessary security pre-caution, such as opening only 8333 port and disabling SSH

make full use of and derive benefit from (a resource).
"500 companies sprang up to exploit this new technology"
synonyms:	utilize, make use of, put to use, use, use to good advantage, turn/put to good use, make the most of, capitalize on, benefit from, turn to account, draw on; More
make use of (a situation) in a way considered unfair or underhand.
"the company was exploiting a legal loophole"
It can be exploited for their own gains, thus 'exploit'.

I'm looking to add such a feature to the app too.. it'll entirely be server-sidded, which there is no background process running on your phone unlike Paranoid.
However there's always a cost to it :( Currently I'm still unable to get the critical mass from this app to break even on the monthly server cost..
but thanks for pointing out, I will keep a lookout!

You're silly. If that's what you mean, you should plant your own crops, make your own food, build your own house. Why buy from others?
Why are you using a computer now?

yes and get scammed by banks. Amazon is being charged 4% for that transaction by Visa/MasterScam + Banks for doing nothing.
Accepting Bitcoin would have removed that 4% entirely, which may sometimes double its profit margin/

I own 250 :) strong hands, no bear market can shake me off my holdings.
I've been with bitcoin ever since knowing it back in 2013 May, from someone on a Samsung NFC hackathon co-organized by Microsoft in Singapore. 
I was just amazed at how someone could sent money to another person without a centralized party, after some research.
I bought over 100 BTC just the following week, it was about 10,000 SGD from Mt. Gox.
If you look at the bigger picture of the global economy, the current valuation of Bitcoin is well underpriced. You shouldn't even be bothered about its value in USD anyway, because USD will just be worthless over time.
