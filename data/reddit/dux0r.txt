I just checked and this doesn't seem to be true, or at least not fully true. Coinbase still tells me *"We're sorry, this feature is not available in United Kingdom yet."*
Like others have said though, there's no shortage of decent exchanges within Europe already.

I just read this entire thread and there are two stunningly obvious points which have been repeated time and again which you seem to refuse to accept.
1) USD must legally be accepted by US businesses, as a result USD are much safer and much more valuable, if other factors are ignored, for 99.9% of US citizens. Several people outlined this and you're just ignoring it and coming back to the same argument, that USD don't have some magical quality that makes them better. They do, several, one of which is legal backing. Others haven't even touched on an array of other advantages government backed currencies have over BTC. **USD and BTC are not the same**, they have a huge number of advantages and disadvantages over and under each other.
2) If all you want to do is argue is that BTC could be used as a currency in place of USD and be given the same laws to protect it and government backing to protect it against inflation etc, then **you're correct**, but you could say the exact same thing about beans or apples or shoes or the giant shit I took last night, it's a completely inert point of conversation. It's like suggesting that if everyone decided to call a table a chair and call a chair a table, nothing would change. Sure, **but who gives a fuck**?
tl;dr: [Sec_Henry_Paulson is 100% correct]( taken at face value the point the meme is making is completely inert and without point. If it's being used to back an argument about politics or bitcoin then it's equally meritless and useless.

Actually his initial point was that BTC and USD are equal. He then refused to accept the counter arguments made against this point, stating that legal backing is just a result of peoples choices, and like you say, that the value of money primarily exists because people perceived it that way, then set up laws and assets to back it.
While both of these points are true, they're completely irrelevant points to make. Yes, given power of law and hundreds of years of common use and various other factors, BTC could replace USD, but so could potatos or shovels or girls tits. Why even make that argument?
If you want to argue or campaign that BTC have benefits over USD and should therefore come to replace them, that's fine, but don't try to suggest that they're the same, they're not. And if you want to argue that they *could be* then I'll give you an equally pointless argument that turkeys and beans could be.
