Your definitely right, but for some reason I'd rather risk all my money in bitcoin just for that small chance of having the last laugh is all this.

I will spend roughly 0.02 on some of the new porn available to check out how that's working and then I will purchase a small item for about 0.04 on overstock or fancy, and then donate the remaining 0.02  to my sceptical friend and then 0.02 to my technologically retarded grandmother to show her how our world is and has changed before she passes away

I use the robocoin atm in Vancouver to buy my bitcoins, I tried to wire money to an exchange,  it was time consuming and full of verification and bullshit, much easier for me and other people who aren't good with that stuff to just throw your money into an atm and pay the fee.

I use the robocoin machine in vancouver to buy my bitcoins. This machine is in my eyes the best ATM because I can not only buy bitcoin but cash them out also. The only problem is the fees are very high. Yesterday when bitstamp was roughly at 820$ the machine was asking 952$ a bitcoin. Factors taken into consideration must be that canadian currency has to be converted to usd and then an additional 5% fee is charged, and with the canadian dollar being at roughly 91 cents the fee isnt incredibly unreasonable.

I use the atm all the time, its so easy and all you have to do is wait a bit and they always come, dont freak out
