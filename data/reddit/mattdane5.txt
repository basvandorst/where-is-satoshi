I find prices on CoinDeal pretty attractive compared to other exchanges. Also now there is tokens giveaway till 12th Nov I think, which might lower trading fees.

Maybe [buycoinnow.now]( will be good option, you can easily buy low amount of BTC. Transaction are fast, about 24h and verification process is typical for such platforms. Also fees are attractive because it's like 7% I think.

As far as I know on CoinDeal you can purchase BTC now using a credit card with PLN, EUR, USD or GBP, also deposit are free

such sites are good options if you want to purchase btc, not only for beginners but also for professional users. the thing is if you are a trader, you will have to transfer these coins on exchange

Try CoinDeal, there are pretty high security standards like 2FA, SSL, CloudFlare and SwissSign protection and so on. Wide selection of coins, about 50 now I think, these less known too. I've never had any problems with registration or transactions. Website is clear and user friendly.

imo easiest way are platform focused on it like [buycoinnow.com]( I use it from time to time to buy even smaller amounts of BTC. Process of verification and transactions are fast, also fees are pretty low.

yeah, there are more and more places were you can use bitcoin directly, but I think people still are't willing to pay with it, idk why

To me the fastest way is to use [buycoinnow.com]( platform focused on selling BTC with low fees. You have to go through verification process, it takes no longer 24 hours. Transactions are also fast and you can do it by credit/debit card, bank transfer, Skrill or Neteller.

I think CoinDeal is pretty good when it comes to prices, fees are low and deposits in EUR, PLN, CHF, GBP and USD are free of any charge

Maybe try some platforms focused on selling BTC at the beginning like [buycoinnow.com]( pretty basic and user friendly website which let you purchase Bitcoin using debit card, bank transfer, Skrill or Neteller. Verification process is usually no longer than 24 hours, depends on their support which is really helpful in case of any issue by the way.

Mining is not profitable, you will need professional industrial equipment which costs a lot of money. I think now the best option is just to buy Bitcoin

Buycoinnow is fine but there is one problem with such platforms in the course of time, if you want to trade, you  have to use your ID to register and transfer these coins on a cryptocurrency exchange.
