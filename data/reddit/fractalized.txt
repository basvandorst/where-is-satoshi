Actually it can be a good idea to hold a "honeypot wallet" on a server, with a small amount of bitcoin in - in conjunction with other security measures. At the least it certainly is not a "ridiculous approach" although I would put a little more than a few millibits in it. Also I doubt that you can know what advice every security professional has ever advocated.

I am a big fan of Bitcoin but i am also a realist, so this will get downvoted no doubt because I disagree with the hive mind of the bitcoin subreddit - but fuck "bits" the idea is not a good one - we have seen for years people trying to push crap like this. 
1.00000001 is the correct notation so lets call these units what they are!! not bits - just Bitcoins...
I would further like to add that there will ALWAYS be a subset of people that will never use Bitcoin - as much as you might want them to. This kind of campaign only caters to that subset.

I would say for trading with customers funds whilst telling them the funds were "offline" justifies the label scammer.

I can recommend an animation I created. 
It costs 0.05 bitcoins and you can download it instantly from [here]( (coindl.com) 
Or 
You could by some pixels at my new website (btcpix.com) [here]( - each pixel costs 0.0001 bitcoins - you can put any image you like + a link on your pixels
So you only pay once and advertise for life.
Also there are ~~1001~~ 997 random pixels that contain a bitcoin prize! Top prize is 10 bitcoins!!!

Good catch sorry I'm on my phone, should be bunch! I have edited the post.

I wrote the code I used to generate the word list in PHP, I can post it here if you want but I need to get home first so it will be all few hours, let me know if you want it. 
As for the software I used to run the list against the wallet, I used 
The wallet I had was a bitcoin core wallet. I know the software can try different types of wallet although I'm not sure if that includes your one. The software has a free trial so you can try before you buy to see if it works.

Cheers, I really did do a little dance around the room when I realised I had got back into the wallet.

Thanks!

ok here is the code i used, it creates a .txt file in the same directory as where the script is located....
    &lt;?php
    $words = array('put', 'the', 'words', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'create', 'your', 'list', 'from', 'in', 'here');   
    
    $num = count($words); 
    
    //The total number of possible combinations 
    
    $total = pow(2, $num);
    
    //Loop through each possible combination  
    
    $fp = fopen('list.txt', 'w');
    
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $total; $i++) {  
    
        //For each combination check if each bit is set 
    
        for ($j = 0; $j &lt; $num; $j++) { 
    
           //Is bit $j set in $i? 
    
            if (pow(2, $j) &amp; $i) { 
    
    		fwrite($fp, $xxx);
    		}
        } 
    fwrite($fp, "
");	
    
    }
    fclose($fp);
    ?&gt;

When you put it like that is sounds bad to me - my BTC is now worth 0.13? 
Even if i then have 100 of them, it still sounds like a step backwards to me.
Say we go along with your plan, and then the value rises so that a BTC is 130 again? What if it falls? Are you just going to keep changing it? I don't think you guys have thought this through. 
BTC coin is still young and while the bulls are hypnotized by the upside they forget the price is not set and value can fall as well as rise. If you think a decentralized currency will ever behave like a regular fiat after just a few years in existence then you need to think again.

Yes, BTC is the correct choice.

Interesting read.

I purchased/mined a large amount of bitcoin a few years ago when they were cheap. I could quite easily sell a large amount well below current value and still make an insanely huge profit, whilst giving my friends a good bargain in the deal. I would imagine companies and institutions to do the same.

I concur - It is obvious to see that the intentions for this "idea" are good.
However, it just seems ridiculous to me.

That's how [easybitcoin]( works. Members balances are USD and then converted to BTC on withdrawal.

Actually 10,000,000 satoshis equals one bitcoin
431,000 satoshis is the price of a coke.

I think you might be looking for [CoinURL]( - They pay you in bitcoin for shrinking links just like adf.ly - except much better stats and tools in your back office and other adverting options are available. Much better than what adf.ly offers and they pay in BTC.
