“lol”

Thank you for this. So cringey when the media and newbies get these wrong but use them confidently. Especially the media because they’re to damn lazy to do any research.

I asked one of the reps a month ago on /btc . He said January 1st. Something seems fishy here...

@_date: 2018-05-20 21:41:26

@_date: 2019-11-27 21:53:41

what’s the point of these posts ? other than having nothing to do with the current price and or state of bitcoin now.

My friend bought at 450... Let’s just say he’s happy.

Why are you trying to “convince” people ? Educate people then let THEM decide if it’s a right move for them.

lol... only if real estate was this cheap in Los Angeles. 
22k might buy you a dumpser behind walmart.

This is what I’m doing but $100 at a time. Do you think that’s too much ? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:24:52
that’s a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:45:29
It’s weird how I felt cringe from a comic. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:54:30
i love how there is either very vague or miss information when it comes to bitcoin. the headline is such bullshit.
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:17:55
Who the fuck drew this shit? I use to see this ad all the time and never thought twice about looking into bitcoin because of this damn drawing...
