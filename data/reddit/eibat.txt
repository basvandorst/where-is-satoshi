Yes. Actually, it's currently the only way a channel gets opened: One party provides the funding.
Yes, all mediators must have reserves at least as large as the amount transferred.
If you like to delve into the details, here's a introduction to lightning by Andreas: 
And here's the full specification:

The new design is horrible. It looks like a generic ICO scam page, the swaths of black make me feel unwelcome.

Quite the opposite. A 2MB hardfork is an *additive* approach to scaling, yielding one extra MB.
But SegWit offers a *multiplicative* factor of 1.8 to increase the throughput (*). 
Every later blocksize increase is magnified by this factor.
(*) Given the percentage of witness data in the blocks from the last few weeks. When transactions become more complex, the factor will be even higher.

To be precise, you can't compile it with assertions disabled (NDEBUG). [Source](

Here's an adapted version of the bitcoind.service template that fits OP's setup:
    [Unit]
    Description=Bitcoin's distributed currency daemon
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    User={YOUR_USER_NAME}
    
    Type=forking
    PIDFile=/home/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/.bitcoin/bitcoind.pid
    Environment=HOME=/home/{YOUR_USER_NAME}
    ExecStart={YOUR_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_BITCOIND} -daemon
    
    Restart=always
    PrivateTmp=true
    TimeoutStopSec=60s
    TimeoutStartSec=2s
    StartLimitInterval=120s
    StartLimitBurst=5
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save this content to '/etc/systemd/system/bitcoind.service' and run 'sudo systemctl enable bitcoind' and 'sudo systemctl start bitcoind'. Bitcoind is now running and will auto-start after booting.

Did this happen after the latest BU vulnerability? Do you have any proof or additional sources?

Can you give a link to the repository?

Here's a glance at the next big features:
Some core contributors, especially gmaxwell, are opposed to the idea of roadmaps, deeming them detrimental to decentralized collaboration. That's why no updated roadmaps have been officially announced yet.

It even seems the main committer (and author of the article) lacks basic understanding of the implementation language (C++).
For example, [this commit](
is totally bogus. It adds a few misleading comments, but doesn't change the runtime behavior at all. (`stageit` is not an iterator of data owned by `parentHashes`, as the commit suggests.)

No. The votes that haven't been cast are distributed in the proportion of the votes that have been cast. They are not counted towards Segwit by default.
The votes for “don't care“ (the third option) are currently assigned to Segwit.

Same here, and I'm only using their site manually and at a normal pace. No bots or API calls.
