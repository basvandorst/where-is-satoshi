It's on a virtual machine that is almost out of space (why I switched to pruned mode before), the disk is full disk encrypted, and the wallet file is in the home linux directory which also has home encryption.
There is very little chance of recovering a deleted file in this situation.

I really need to believe that these are not lost yet. I know I seem calm but I am really on the edge here.

I didn't use a hardware wallet because I wanted perpetual mixing that joinmarket offers. Hardware wallets have privacy problems. Also the 1-2% annual return that market making with it offers.

In my case any passphrase you enter generates a different wallet. So you very much need the passphrase (actually called a "mnemonic extension phrase" in this case).

I know I have an mnemonic extension, I had half of it written down. I lost the other half. Which is why I am still hopeful to bruteforce it.

I was just speaking in point form to rapidly get the point across. Also I am stressed as fuck. You seriously view my posts as having "broken english"?
That said, how would I even know that someone had a mnemonic extension (which can be any password of your choice) was composed of words from a specific [word list](
Also why would you assume I shouldn't have help building a brute force tool? 
Even if I stole someone's multimillion dollar wallet, I already have done the hard part (some fucking how, presumably with significant expertise), why would building a brute force tool be hard for me in that case?

By directing people who can write brute force software to me. I have half of the mnemonic extension, I just need to brute force the other half.

Good suggestion but no :(

If you don't know about extension phrases then you probably can't help with the problem I have anyway.
This is a mnemonic extension phrase (that's what joinmarket calls it anyway):

Hi. I'm the idiot that lost his mnemonic extension.
Doing that I believe fixed the problem in the past, I was thinking that this was a corrupted joinmarket wallet cache or something of that nature. **So delete the jm directory and reinstall jm would fix that. Jm directory had the wallet file in it.**
I have a habit of making new joinmarket wallets fairly often because:
1. Joinmarket can become slow to display balance after it has used many addresses (or at least it used to be this way).
2. Joinmarket is a mixer and leaking your wallet also leaks all of your past mixes, so its handy to just make a new wallet.
Because I have done this so many times, I (stupidly) felt 100% confidence to just `rm -rf` the joinmarket dir and rebuild the wallet. I have all the phrases written on paper and I test every phrase before I use the wallet.
The joinmarket directory that I deleted (and pulled a fresh copy of from github) contained the wallet file.
This wallet is in a virtual machine so it has very limited space, which is why I switched to prune mode at one point in the first place. I think the chances of getting the wallet file back now are very small because the disk is almost completely full so the file would have been written over. Also it's an encrypted disk.

 I am the one who lost the wallet. This wallet is worth more money than I have.
