What about a the likes of square payments? In the UK we only pay 1.75% with no minimum charge for credit or debit.

They have to comply with anti money laundering laws I'm guessing!

I wanted some Mpesa money quickly (UK Expat in Kenya), I used bitpesa once and it was very convenient and quick.
But it's no more convenient or quicker than another service called worldremit (which actually worked out having a better rate of exchange)

True almost daylight robbery, but it's not the 'transaction fee' he's referring to it's something entirely different.

Hmm, I already had coins so that wasn't an issue for me, but it definitely worked out cheaper the 3 weeks ago (?) that I did it, perhaps I calculated wrong!
Also do you work there? Can you get my id processed, its been stuck on processing since i added it 3 weeks ago!

Judging from your comment history, you seem to both hate bitcoin and know absolutely nothing about it.
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:46:09
Not with that attitude!
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:43:32
No they send Mpesa also!

I doubt safaricom will be interested, but there's already bitcoin innovation happening here! See

It doesn't work that way, you send bitcoins they receive mobile money mpesa or similar.

Not really, mpesa and bitcoin can be used with minimal set up by anyone. Visa requires a bank account or at least a prepaid card, and payments can generally only be received by businesses with merchant accounts etc.

Was thinking of getting some ram, price of the ram was great but ฿0.824 ($35.95) for shipping to UK :(

ATM's in Kenya are often guarded by armed security.

They can both quickly and easily transfer value between people, although bitcoin does a lot more they are similar in that respect.

A good way to put it is that your more likely to guess someone debit card pin number the first time, than for a collision to occur with a decent address generation algorithm

what about buttercoin? 
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:11:38
I'm sure I remember a lot of talk about p2p being thrown around, must have been users suggesting features.

Swahili isn't a country it's a language (and an ethnic group/culture), Kenya is the country and their currency isn't MPESA so they can't print it anyway. MPESA is an electronic money transfer service using mobile phones, and it's run mainly by a telecommunications company called Safaricom.
