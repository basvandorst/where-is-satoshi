I guess they must of been good at their job.  I guess they weren't easily replaceable in producing and distributing oil so efficiently.  People voted with their wallets for SO because they gained more value by purchasing oil products from them.  Free markets self organize so the fittest rises to the top.  They controlled most of  the supply chain because they earned it.

Spare me from your ranting/ad hominems as it's just inefficient and a waste of time.  Your example of Bill Gates implying Microsoft is a private monopoly that abuses people isn't entirely accurate. Microsoft enjoys its size and leverage because it had first mover advantage by establishing the most compatible mainstream OS to serve customer needs.  On the bad side, it also enjoys a lot of IP rights and an army of lawyers to enforce the non-infringment of those IP rights.  The latter is a result of government intervention and not the free market.  I think everyone can agree the definition of a free market is the absence of government intervention.  IP rights are just miniature legal monopolies.  People would otherwise opt for Linux because its faster, more secure, and free.  But Linux doesn't have the network effect or the legal leverage that Microsoft has in defense of Windows and so its not as well adopted at the moment.
A small independent oil producer wouldn't have been alone in competing against SO. There were numerous independent oil producers at that time.  When they were acquired, they typically were allowed to function as they did before with the same personnel.  Often when someone drastically alters how an operation works when it already works to begin with, that makes it less efficient.  A better word to define SO is conglomeration and not corporation.  You seem to think SO was an homogenous entity which coercively ruled over people.  In reality, it was a product of the free market and in free markets you can say no when ever you want.  You have the option to say no to a higher wage job or to say no to lower price oil.  Obvioulsy, nobody in their right would say no those things.  They would choose the better deal but they still have the option. 
Name for me one corporation which has spent its own money to initiate violence?  Now name for me one government which hasn't spent other people's money to initiate violence? Answer  should be zero.  Answer  should be infinite as time itself.  The only money a government has is the money it confiscates at gun point through taxation.  They then use that money start wars/violence.  
How does a large corporation like Standard Oil compare to answer  Of course, it doesn't even compare.  Corporations don't tax people or start wars because **violence is expensive** to them.  They would go out of business. Only governments can commit violence and start wars.  Therefor, Standard Oil was not an effective government as you tried to deduce from how successful it was.  If it were a government not driven by profit, it would have taxed all the "supply lines, the distribution system, the market outlets, the food supply links, the local governments, the local courts, the local law enforcement" it successfully acquired.  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
Free markets don't need "checks and balances".  Free markets automatically regulate themselves.  How profitable is it to not server your customers better than your competitors or potential competitors which may arise if prices are raised.  How profitable is it to have an accident which kills employees?  Equipment has to be replaced along with new employees which must to be expensively trained.  
I'm done debating.

You're a moron.  So by "safeguards" do you mean we should expect a legal monopoly to regulate a supposed private monopoly and not be corrupt or take political actions in the process?  If Intel had no "safeguards", Intel would still not be able to buy Texas Instruments or NVIDEA.  Even if it did buy them out and raised its prices, some other smaller more ambitious startup would under cut those exorbitant prices and take away market share from Intel.  Intel would then lobby the government to make an expensive cost barrier(ie some kind of permit or licensing) to enter the computer chip market which would not be capitalism's fault but soicalism/government's fault. The agency in charge of doing the licensing would not make economic decisions but political decisions and only amount to being a hindrance to optimal competition in the market.  The licensing/permit process would all be based on the premise that businesses aren't good enough and have to be micromanaged.  It would be as if businesses don't have a reputation to keep or don't have to compete to satisfy customers and win a profit to keep their doors open.

Because they voted for no other options.  The other options were pointless because they provided less value in return.

Why would a "non-male" board member give the Bitcoin Foundation "more credibitility"? Why would a non-female board member give the Bitcoin Foundation more credibility? Why should we even concern ourselves with race, gender, or nationality? Frankly, I think the very premise of purposefully advocating a female for the next board member to give "more credibility" to the Foundation or any organization is insulting to women. It implies they are less competent and therefor need preferential treatment. Same goes for the other demographics. IMO, self exposure to political correctness is poison.

You are emotionally compromised due to the situation and it is understandable.  Let me ask you something. If you purchased $20 worth of merchandise from an online store and they didn't deliver, i.e. lost your money, should the store owners go to jail?  Granted losing $20 isn't the same scale as losing $1000s of dollars but the same logic still applies.  You took a risk therefor you bear the consequences of taking that risk if it goes bad.    The owners and executives of Mt.Gox will bear the consequences making a very unprofitable mistake and a damaged reputation which comes with it. "Regulation" wouldn't solve anything.  It just micromanages the common sense out of the situation, e.g. the FDIC insuring banks which incentives them to make riskier loans.  
Markets regulate themselves.

LMAO  I own myself therefor i own my labor and the risk i take with that labor!  I took the risk of investing in Bitcoin and THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT.


More like the taxes are the fees extorted from me by the mafia for supposedly protecting me when i didn't voluntarily agree to their protection to begin with.  Similar to the mafia, a government is a monopoly of violence within a geographically defined territory.  Given there is hefty exit tax of at least 15% on pre-taxed equity and that i have friends and family in the US, the idea i can just renounce my citizenship and move to another country which may or may not accept me ISN'T THAT SIMPLE.  We are tax slaves and our government slave masters don't like it when slaves escape the plantation.  


Given what I've typed above, evidently i am more or less forced to "participate" in any particular economy over ruled by a government.  I'm certainly forced to participate in this economy.

Oh wow...You are genuine bull in the china shop psychopath.  So i was just randomly skimming through your response/book when i ran into that little bit.  Do you wanna know what the pledge of allegiance should say in its lyrics?  
*THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY!  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY! THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY BUT THE MONEY IT TAKES!*
All the roads, bridges, courts, etc are funded by the fruits of productive private sector.  The government first TAKES money from the private sector and then buys the labor, wood, black robes, cement, and steel FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR to construct those services FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  Those services would privately be available if the government didn't crowd them out because the market will provide so long as there is demand.  The government has nothing without the private sector. You have it ass backwards.

Why don't we just save ourselves from all the 51% attack trouble by renouncing our faith in Bitcoin and converting to Peercoin instead?  Having peace of mind is priceless and Peercoin's PoS model makes a 51% attack cost prohibitive as the attacker buys more coins and shoots the price up.  Peercoin might have a .01 transaction fee but its designed to be a backbone currency(like gold reserves in a bank) and not a transactional currency.  It's a better fit for being traded on decentralized exchanges like Open Transactions not just because of its high transaction fee but because it isn't very reliant on transaction fee revenue due to its low cost of operation.  On OT, Peercoins will be represented in abstract units on OT's independent trading database.  Therefore, OT will cancel out Peercoin's transaction fee while not bloating its blockchain. 
Peercoin and OT working together would be a powerful combination as they are the best of both worlds, i.e store of value(Peercoin), high volume and cheap transactions(OT).  Just as Facebook displaced the the social networking industry and gained a dominant market share by having a leaner/less chaotic interface or how Google displaced the search industry by having more efficient search algorithms as well as leaner interface, Peercoin and OT will displace the cryptocurrency industry.  Like Facebook and Google, Peercoin and OT are leaner and meaner.  The Peercoin blockchain is only 300 mb which gives it great scalability.  To add to its scalability, it has locked minting to incentivize regular users to run full nodes on their PCs in order to maintain their stake of the Peercoin money supply while inadvertently servicing/securing the network.

LMAO, your are NOT an anarchist.  Anarchy = A(without)narchy(monarchs).  Essentially it means a way of life without government overlords arbitrarily ruling over the individual.  Standard Oil had a large market share of the oil industry but was it every able to control prices? NO.  Why?  Because there was more of a free market back then.  If Standard Oil raised its prices, a smaller company would have exploited the high prices but undercutting them.  The result was a massive explosion in human citizens standard of living.  Poor foreign immigrants voted for capitalism with their feet by moving to the U.S. and none of them were enticed with a government handout.

Wikipedia: is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wages and private property **while retaining respect for personal property**,[8] and **in favor of common ownership** of the means of production,[9][10] direct democracy, and a horizontal network of **voluntary** associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
You're against privatization and capitalism but you call yourself some kind of anarchist?  You believe in respecting "personal property" but want to abolish "private property"?   You advocate "direct democracy"(which is mob rule) and "voluntary associations" at the same time?  Frankly, that's not a logically consistent philosophy.
