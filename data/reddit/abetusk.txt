FreeCodeCamp has an address:

    Ethereum: 0x0ADbEf2471416BD8732cf0f3944294eE393CcAF5
    And to prove these wallets are indeed ours (and that we haven't been hacked),
    we've signed these on 
    
Which they sent out through their [Twitter account 
FreeCodeCamp offers a completely [free/libre online programming course](  Like Khan academy but focused on [coding and completely libre](

Thanks, good point!
17-18M gives estimates that are in range.
For others that are curious, here's a [short term projected Bitcoin supply char](  It looks like it won't hit 18M until 2020 or so.

Please consider these organizations:
* [Harvard Personal Genome Project]( - providing an open science platform for people to donate their health and genomic data to the public (and science).  They also sequence participants when funds are available.
* [Open Humans]( - providing an open science platform for people to share their health and genomic data and connect participants to scientific researchers
* [OpenSNP]( - providing an open science platform for people to share their  genotyping information (e.g. 23andMe, Ancestry.com, etc. data) as well as providing questionnaires for participants.
All of these provide an invaluable service to the scientific community in providing free/libre and often unencumbered (as in CC0) data to the public at large, instead of a select few researchers.  They're almost always chronically underfunded and could definitely use the funds.
For some context, whole genome sequencing is about $1000. $10M could theoretically sequence 10k people.  Imagine what kind of machine learning, scientific insight and data analysis could be done on 10,000 whole genomes that's made available to the public.
The Pineapple Fund sounds pretty amazing!  Thanks for giving back!

I'm a little confused.  He says that his conservative estimate is 2% of a $200T market, but then he says he imagines a $300k-$400k / BTC valuation.
Doing some back of the envelope math:
    $200T * 0.02 / (21M BTC) ~= $190,476.19 / BTC
Where the 21M comes from the upper bound on total bitcoins able to be mined.
Maybe you can get a factor of 2 from lost, stolen, or corrupted bitcoins, meaning that maybe there's only 10M in existence, which would get you in the $400k / BTC range.
Of course, any other estimate that estimates Bitcoin used for more than 2% of of the total global wealth inflates this number even more...

Plot twist: This is actually one of the better explanations of Bitcoin out there.

TLDR; Take the world GDP (\~$80T) and divide by the total BTC (\~21M) to get in the ballpark of $3.8M/BTC
If Bitcoin is going to really take over as the dominant currency ("going to the moon") then it means that a significant portion of the worlds economy will be in Bitcoin. The currently estimated world [GDP as of 2017 is about $80T]( The upper bound on the number of Bitcoin is [about 21M](
So as a 'back of the envelope' calculation, take the world GDP, which presumably would be stored and transacted upon by Bitcoin, by the total number of Bitcoin to get the price per Bitcoin. Consider that emerging economies will increase world GDP in the coming years (leading to an increase in the numerator) and also take into account some Bitcoin are lost (decreasing the denominator) and you can see that $5M/BTC is not completely unrealistic.

Just my opinion:  BTC, ETH and LTC are very easily converted to each other, so there is no impediment to transferring from one to the other (like there is converting to BTC from USD, say).  Since they're so liquid between each other, any differential in valuation, delay in correlation or other obvious pattern creates an arbitrage opportunity.  Any arbitrage opportunity noticed can get quickly exploited due to the ease of transfer between them which tightens the correlation between them.
TL;DR arbitrage

There's everyone around the vegan commenting about them vegan.
Alternate punchline: Someone makes a "how can you tell someone's vegan?" joke.

Ha, this is great.  Here's my bid:
