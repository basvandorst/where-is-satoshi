If I recall correctly, he did some speculating (along with many others) that Nick Szabo was a likely candidate, and may have done some stylimetrics analysis on his website. Could be remembering incorrectly though. Don't think he has ever made a firm claim though.

He checked out as 'cash'. Check the website. You can pay locally in China. Nothing gets validated, or requires payment when placing. The order was presumably never paid for, and never shipped.

This hacker: 1) is trying to extort people and doxx Satoshi, 2) told Wired his name was "Jeffrey", 3) hacked the SourceForge page so that the word "bitcoin" read "buttcoin", and 4) threatened someone by saying "send me some coins before I hitman you".
You honestly don't think that profile is overwhelming likely to be a teenage male? This isn't "girls can't be computer scientists", this is "this piece of shit moron is almost certainly a male teenager". I apologize for any misogynistic or bro-y episodes you have had to endure, but I don't think this is one of them.

No,that's not how mining works. If I were you though, I'd find the drive and double check you never actually mined any.
