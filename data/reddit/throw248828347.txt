This is mostly a theoretical value, which derives from BTC price and the amount of transactions (which are capped by bs limit). Not the "true" cost.

Because there is nothing in between:
A: Can run on a raspberrypi on slow dsl
B: Needs multiprocessor xeon with 256gb ram on 1gbps connection
Why not modest increase that still works over tor, imho this is not a binary issue :(
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:21:51


Based on what. This recent presentation shows average node bandwidth has grown pretty nicely:  (slide 33)
Even tor nodes seem to average ~6 Mbit/s.

There is some kind of testnet, you can run it with option -chain_nol ... 
cla ss ic also has a testnet with fle.xtrans, option --testnet-ft=1

2 cent is very low, not sure if it will confirm :/
I never did it myself but I think child pays for parent works like this: if you have a up to date version of electrum you need to click wallet-&gt;coins, then in the new tab "coins" search the unconfirmed transaction right click "spend", then send it to another address of you with a high fee (the fee needs to be higher as normal as it needs to cover both transactions). On older electrum just search the address under addresses tab and right click send from. 
Then miner that wants the transaction fee will include the new transaction and the unconfirmed "parent". Hope that is not wrong, but afaik it works like this.

Does not matter it is still opensource, if they would do something that is not accepted, fork button, also if "it" would get lots of support core is always free to include E.B/A.D settings. If you mean this "[grant]( I think that has not payed out anything yet, but whatever.

Instead of calling me a retard you could have explained what is not correct about it. If you click the link in the post you can see under "Serialisation costs":


















I am not denying that segwit seems to have some positive effect for hardware wallets and stuff, but I still stand by that claim in my post above. In the best case segwit tx are -1%, all other cases add overhead.
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:25:15


Hmm it offers that to me imho, which other client is there that I could run (for increased non-witness space)? C lass ic also has the same setting now (minus AD). Maybe X T is still bip109?


Everyone can already recompile and change this value, it just makes it easier for the end user. Imho letting it run into the 1MB limit with high fee s also changes its game theory :/


But the default AD is 12 now, that means those miners need to create 12 blocks in a row to override nodes EB setting. I think this is very unlikely, if colluding miners are big enough to do this then we have bigger problems anyway and need to change PoW asap imho. 
Maybe AD setting has to go, or it needs different default values, not sure. But I think the idea of letting nodes and miners decide the blocksi ze is very reasonable.


This change makes it incredibly easy for a small cartel of miners to change the rules to their benefit or as an attack on their competitors.
They are still hard to override. Colluding miners need to be big enough to create &gt;12 blocks in a row to override, there is also economic incentiative to not do it. (because blocks need to be sized to be handled by as many nodes as possible, as decentralization is one of Bitcoin's key values -&gt; they want to mine something that still has as much value as possible.)

You are one of the very vocal guys here, but this post shows you did not do your homework. There is no activation threshold in B U, it could fork at any time (that is why bitcoin . com pool could fuckup with a bigger block). It relies on common sense of miners to judge when the network is ready.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:52:31
Okay, thanks for taking the time to write a more reasonable answer :)
I know about Schnorr and MAST, but this is still some time away and experimental afaik. No idea what SA stands for (signature aggregation maybe?). Somehow it still seems to me longterm it also needs a blocks ize increase (even if only a small one with all the other things combined), and I don't think it will get easier to do this in a few years or so. That is why I don't get the core position: they have a bs increase in the roadmap (flexcap, or something like it) but no rough date, nothing, just far in the future when it is safe(tm), but maybe it will never be safe enough for them lol. I wish I could just run core with an "-yesplzbiggerblocks-2-4-8-MB-allfinewithme" option :)
The problem is that Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum, there are hundreds of alts just waiting to leech value from us, and they will if low value transaction demand shifts to them. As a bitcoin only holder I want to prevent this as much as possible... :)
Sure it enables more than 2MB it was just for comparison, and the overhead is very tiny, maybe you are right and it will be totally worth it later. Whatever, it is up to the miners to activate it or not at this point, if they do I would upgrade my node to be compatible in one or the other way.
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:27:05
"it" is not going to fork without majority support of nodes, miners are not suicidal. And if it ever forks *with* majority support it will become BTC, minority is then the altcoin (example ETC). 
@_date: 2017-02-21 08:54:38
Um no, even with 2MB segwit would be different, a 2MB non-witness blocksize can hold more transactions than a 2MB segwit block. Because sw adds some additional data, also sw blocks are slower to process: 
I am only a user not a dev, but in my case I run B U not because I hate the core devs, but because I think that a non-witness increase is very needed for bitcoins longterm sustainability. As there is no optional way provided by core devs to support bigger non-witness space, I am sadly forced to go somewhere else :( If a option for this would be provided by core, then BU would not exist, it was created by inaction and not listen to (at least some part) of the userbase.

R.I.P. looks like he is banned now lol. Was it the doxing in rbtc or that he was a bought/hacked fake account (did not post for 8 years then very active only in bitcoin subreddits) - we will never know.
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:23:49
Hmm, imho bitcoin day2day activity is part of financial sovereignity (i.e. unbanked, others hate paypal).
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:54:10
Edit: I wrote something here which was not correct. Sorry about that, apparently it seems I am an uninformed person. Also luke-jr seems like some cool dude :)
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:27:39
Yeah great, I did not say they are idiots. But you don't have to be an 1337 c++ coder to understand segwit.
Earlier I've seen you asking [how blocks propagate]( what makes you qualified to comment on this?
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:12:22
Maybe a little bit less stuff like point 1 would help your position...
Even if roger and bitcoincom would get swallowed by the earth tomorrow and are non existent it would not change anything about activating segwit or not.
Also point 3. It should be obvious for everyone with logical thinking that miners business model is to include transactions and bundle them into blocks. With shrinking reward (/and more demand for tx) it is just natural that they want the blocksize increased. This is also a very important fact to keep the network secure in the future. (and segwit alone doesn't do enough in this direction imho)
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:59:14
Hmm what did he do to you, I can read your posts over there just fine. Eragmus posted the B.U thing there earlier, so he does not seem to be ba nned.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:35:46
Citation needed. Also it is not about overriding anything, it is about giving options to the user.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:30:30
Yeah it is ironic, without the increase segwit would probably not be controversial at all (but who knows, my guess is miners do not like the segwit discount and adding another fixed limit).
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:26:04
You guys all sound like a broken record lol. The compromise was the HK Agreement, segwit AND a minimum 2MB non-witness space. Almost everyone would have been okay with that.
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:21:50
I am a BU user (my node creates around ~hundred tx/day from my users), and this would be the minimum compromise to get me switching back to core.
I am not hating core, not at all, I even still maintain a buildscript for my linux distribution. I used it for years myself, but I think increasing this stupid limit is very important. My thinking is like what the user deathandtaxes wrote 2 years ago on bitcointalk. That was prior to XT, Classic, Segwit etc and all that drama:  
But at the same time I have not much hope, that (everything is fine), (let's decrease the limit first) and ([let's keep bitcoin free]( will allow any increase to this limit :(
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:53:54
Hmm, I am like 95% sure he was that account, but maybe the person I noticed had a similar account name, in that case I am very sorry :(
(sorry if I confused you with someone else here)
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:06:38
Already long ago when I watched it but IIRC his assumption that there is a fee market without blocksize limit only works as long as there is inflation (which exists still for a long time, until block reward runs out). Does not mean anyone plans to change the 21 million cap. Users would not agree so it is pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:16:15


General does not mean everyone has to agree. So of course a majority supporting something is consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:34:22
Hmm, after the H.K. agre.ement? Somehow I really do not remember this, got a link maybe? If this is correct I am going to apologize to you and edit the parent post.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:07:49
Not so sure, seems someone has also spawned a few hundred extra c.ore nodes. Just look at this:  most of this does not look like real users to me... 
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:42:54
Yes I know about those things and I think they are awesome and good. But if onchain is still limited by the 1MB limit, it will passive aggressive force people into lightning channels (because onchain fees will get very expensive) and imho this is not acceptable.
Onchain needs to be able to compete as much as possible (obv. the blockchain can't handle as many transactions anyway, technically not possible. So lightning would in any case have a lot of use, even if only for nano, micro tx. A limit needs to be decided by supply (node bandwidth,cpu,storage) and demand (users), segwit alone does not seem to be the solution to this.
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:38:37
Hmm ok. I thought this would only exist as BIP :)
I guess technically this means you have honored the agr.eement.
Apologies for writing something wrong above... I did not know about this PR. But it seems to be the one that decreases first, but it grows over time so it indeed fullfills the requirements imho.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:24:48
Not a dev only user, I wanted to write something but Cbergmann beat me to it lol.
Many reasons, imho main ones, segwit includes a discount that is not much liked and another fixed limit (blockweight).
Also another reason is that BU is based on core 0.12 codebase, it is not so easy to merge this with the 0.13 codebase (I tried myself but gave up after an hour of fixing merge conflicts).
Core could also merge BU's blocksize setting, maybe with a very sane default value EB1/AD999999, but probably not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:35:10
You may not want to hear this, but imho there are many "f.ake" cor.e no.des at the moment, just look at those ~400 that came up in the last days on some russian hosting provider.. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:16:13
1) If mempool can be so easily manipulated that f.ees rise for everyone than that is a design flaw, needs to be fixed. Not sure what best solution would be, but in an adversarial system you can't rely on people being nice.
2) Yeah lol if cash can do that, points to an incentive misalignment. That this is worth 500 EUR each should also tell something about market and what it demands. 
3) Meh, maybe not nice but protocol allows it, honest miner should earn more in the longterm.
4) Proof that those people are shills or is it only your feeling, maybe there is more support for 2.x than it seems sometimes here..
