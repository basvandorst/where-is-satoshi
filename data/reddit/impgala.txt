buy some on a btc atm, then use them as security deposit for trading on bisq.
kraken is ok, tough.

transactions would be very hard (not impossible), yes. but hodlers can try to get out of the shit, without loosing their savings. this does not work with fiat (.. or gold actually), if its frozen, its gone.

buuut..  we need to tell stories, not facts.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:19:51
you can send a low free transaction anytime, it will just need more time to confirm. people are actually already using the lightning network, bitrefill for example. and about the store of value: depends on the timeframe you are looking at.

1. no debt
2. 3x - 6x your monthly earnings as cash savings
then you can think about DCA with a small percentage of your monthly income. therefore i think bitcoin investment doesn't fit your current financial situation. just don't.

so you dismiss (or at don't care about) the revolutionary social potential of bitcoin. why do you buy it? do you invest or use it? what do you expect from this new money?

i'm here (at least initially) to get over visa. credit cards are not made for the internet. my card data got already stolen 2 times, and after i bought my first steam game with bitcoin i knew this is the solution. paypal can do that too, but then again, where i live i would not need a credit card at all, i just have it to buy things from the web.

it was the hacker know as 4chan, right?
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:09:33
that was a cool response on the second question though
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:21:13
and then bitcoin was created ;)

what happend in the 2008 subprime crisis again? 
@_date: 2019-05-22 09:14:13
it's not about bitcoin, it's about basic moral sense. also, there are laws, depending on the country though. you guys are arguing from a very limited technical view.

what a shitty argument. he made a mistake. this is real life, not an algorithm. as long as he can prove the receiver-address belongs to this company, they have to send him the money back.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:49:53
is this a problem? 
i'm askin because we want the whole world to sell and buy in bitcoin. isn't the network capable for this? the only thing i see is downloading the transaction database will take longer.

i think there may be a problem in the translation. even if i dont speak english very well i try to write down what is happening on the political level in switzerland.
actually there is no "vote" in the near future about bitcoin and there is no "proposal". (those are terms which maybe just have a diffrent meaning in our political system)
at the moment there are two postulate open and one already answerd.
a postulate in switzerland means a letter to the govement (executive) with the ask to check if a specific case needs a law, regulation or some kind of action from the goverment.
here are the links (german, french, italian, no english):
* 
* 
* 
the main topic in the first two are "money laundring" and "fear from a pyramid scheme" and overall "legal security". 
because the swiss banks have this bad reputation about money laundring, the goverment is highly concerned to "dont let this happen again".
the new and last postulate in the list is the one linked above. these was written by a group of authors. (the first two were written by single members of the parlamet). they bassicly say that it would resolve the main issues if bitcoin would be acceptet as foreign currency. because then (and only then) bitcoin would be but in a existing regulatory law-framework.
now im really not sure what the next steps would be if the "bundesrat" is going to say "yes, lets declare bitcoin as a foreign currency". maybe the article is right and the parlament has to discuss about this, and after that there is maybe a vote in the parlament and then maybe someone will make a "referendum" and finally there will maybe a vote about this.
democracy takes time, a lot of time. so dont expect anything strong from switzerland in the next year.
