I'm curious, what photos/writeup did you use to get matches? Your own or a tailored one?

It seems like if you have 2 factor auth and such, you should be okay. However, I just moved away from them because I'm tired of getting a heart attack every time they're posted on r/bitcoin because of a screw-up..

Without responding to OPs claim about knocking sense, one's astronomic net worth doesn't equal infallibility.

Nobody ever lost coins on MtGox until one day they did. As they say, "Past performance is not indicative of future results"
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:04:03
But they pay in other ways, no?
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:54:55
Downvoted for yelling 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:59:58
Everyone's coins were still on MtGox, until one day they just werent
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:59:07
I believe they've been removed now

Traded for the first time in my life today. Sent 0.4btc to BTC-E this morning, currently sitting on 0.85btc.. so, just over doubled my amount.. I doubt I could have done that without such volatility

5 year olds don't invest in bitcoin..

conversely, from his wife's point of view, someone who fucks up your life savings may not be worth staying with..
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:07:24
Would it be possible for anything to be adopted as a currency before first experiencing a few years of high volatility?


Because these are growing pains of a currency that's still blowing people's minds, and will take the long-term to stabilize and begin being seen on its own merits, rather than as a transfer medium..

Have you tried asking Michael Reiter?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:14:02
Not avoidable though, especially with something still in its infancy..
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:05:22
The companies have to have confidence in bitcoin first, no?

Is this going to be the only option for Canadians to deposit funds via Interac Transfer, or do others currently exist?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:28:23
Don't say how or anything..
