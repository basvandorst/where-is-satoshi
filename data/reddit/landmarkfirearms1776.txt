Yes, from what I hear the other exchanges are a little bit more complicated but have lower fees.

Thanks for the link. That's good info. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:21:46
Haha. Nah, I hate those guys. I have worked with them in the past on their SANs and they are so incompetent.

My family used to own two of them before prices got out hand. Miss those subs.

No worries. I'm not saying oh how much you have just trying to compare and see how far behind I am.

I'll be the first to toss in some coinage for the ad. 
I started buying bitcoin for the money, now I am interested in the tech and spreading the word. Let's become a part of history.

Thanks for the heads up! I am a day behind on shows normally. I download them off the app so I can skip shitty interviews and the commercials.

That's how I started and then dumped a few more here and there. When it jumped up past 8 I sold and rebought when it dipped some and did that a few times. I won't anymore cause the market is to crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:42:58
No worries man. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:02
Correct. Thanks!

I own a Disabled Veteran Small Gun Business. This was at the Harrisburg Gun Show this past weekend.
I didn't make any sales via Bitcoin, hardly made any sales at all for a fact. But was able to help educate a lot of people on Bitcoins and was even able to get two people to download Coinbase to get started.

Good place to start is download coinbase from app store and hook your bank account to it  for deposites. You can use your credit card but fees are higher with them.
