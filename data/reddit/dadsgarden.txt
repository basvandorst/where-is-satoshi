Don't use that rubbish or the software recommend in this article, learn to use the cli on an [airgapped machine]( Seriously, basic use requires you to learn how to encrypt, decrypt and clearsign. You don't need some elaborate software on an internet connected machine or web based implementation which defeats the purpose of using gpg to begin with.

He made it pretty clear in the early episodes of Let's Talk Bitcoin that he is not a libertarian (his own words), an anarchist or capitalist but more of a socialist/marxist SJW type. He is basically hot air in an echo chamber with zero influence.

People acting on the behalf of Hearn and Gavin are sock puppeting with the fabricated demand for XT constantly.. Go look at xtnodes, the number has not shifted since the site went live. There is no demand for xt, no-one is using this shit except Hearn.

This user is zhoutong so makes sense he would swee..steal it.
@_date: 2015-08-02 06:17:18
Is this the same Mike Hearn whos only contributions to date have been bugs which forked the network and sock puppets on so hard yet there are next to no fucking xt nodes to be found (and continue to reduce by the day) ??

Why would you create a redesign for a domain you don't own, won't ever own and to which is none of your business how it is operated. Ver owns the domain name, it isn't a community asset. I wish he would redirect it to some altcoin just to troll you socialists.
Try perhaps?
@_date: 2015-08-10 09:54:48
Meanwhile the number of xtnodes has not shifted at all which makes it clear this demand for XT is one big charade.

It's not just about someone gaining access to my encrypted emails/data but my identity. If someone else can sign using my identity, it can be used to do all manner of things in my name, resulting in an identity and reputation that will sooner or later become worthless. Claiming I didn't sign something when it has my name on it is quite difficult and revoking it after the fact doesn't help.
Even should I create a new key, I have no means of proving I am the same person/identity. If someone else in my web of trust has their private key compromised and creates a new one, I have no means of verifying they really are who they say they are even if I am pretty sure they are telling the truth, therefore their reputation with me is lost. For that reason, I treat my gpg private key in the same manner as a valued Bitcoin private key, arguably treated more serious because while I can always buy more bitcoin should someone else gain my private key, I cannot buy my way back in to the web of trust I previously enjoyed with my gpg identity (not for long anyway, will vary from person to person obviously).
If I import my gpg private key into keybase, I've just given them carte blanche to sign anything in my name. If I allow them to create the private keys for me, again, they can at any point in the future sign as me (perhaps they weaken the entropy used in generating the keys). Maybe the company gets sold, hacked, who fucking knows eh? Even if their service is 100% safe to use, I am not technically minded and cannot check their code so I must assume it will at some point compromise the security of my key. It could be tomorrow, years or never, but why risk it for something which can be done quite easily using an offline laptop.
Any email, document etc etc that I need to encrypt or clearsign is created using the offline laptop. To decrypt, I just ferry a device from the online machine to the offline. It is not perfect but still reduces the ways in which someone could attack me (and I don't believe I am a target but it is habit forming to act as if.)
Every day people come here complaining they lost their bitcoin because they used some web wallet or a machine connected to the internet yet for some reason they think using something like keybase won't put them at risk. If an identity there is perceived to have some value, don't be surprised if people attempt and at some point are succesful in taking that from you.
Now none of this guards against someone knocking on the door and pointing a shot gun at my face but that is a different set of problems.

You guys do know that when they write Bitcoin CEO or Bitcoin Chief, they phrase it in the same sense one uses Bank CEO, right? They are not actually implying Karpeles is the CEO of Bitcoin itself.

Andreas is a socialist and thus lives in the world where one can want for anything because someone else is paying for it.
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:00:21
No idea, but I don't imagine I'd use it. Devices like the Trezor are built for a specific purpose and for that reason seem a bad idea which is to say, if I'm buying it, you have a pretty good idea what I'll be doing with it. General purpose laptop on the otherhand - you don't know if I'll be using it to "hack teh planet" or play Facebook games.

No, you're just stupid. They're using Bitcoin CEO in the same manner one uses Banking CEO, Technology CEO etc etc, it's just a reference to the industry. Anyway, if Bitcoin is so fragile that a poorly written headline by the BBC shakes its confidence (or yours as it would seem), it deserves to burn and die.

What if somebody did this or that doesn't have anything to do with what Roger Ver chooses to do with a domain that he owns. I don't even like the guy but it is laughable that just because it is a prominent name that somehow that means the community gets to call the shots - it doesn't. That is some communist thinking you've got going on there, son.

It's opinionated people like yourself who ride on the backs of others all the while having no real clue as to the cost.
[Past 6 months.. topping 100Gb upload each month]( with qt running 24/7. God only knows how much it'd be with an 8MB or 20MB block size cap.. I'm already considering turning it off as it is.
But yeah, you keep running around parroting whatever it is CIA Hearn told you to say.

In all honesty, this is just a bullshit excuse to encourage people not to use or learn how to use it. It is usable and accessible to anyone who cares to learn how and you don't need to have a thorough understanding of computers either to do so - I am proof of that.
You can find it in use every day by the people who congregate in the bitcoin-assets community for use in public statements, private messages, stock trades, [gpg contracts]( and the time stamping of [deeds](
Use of it actually serves as a barrier to entry within the  community as it helps to keep a good % of the riff raff out.

Here's a [guide]( to airgapping.  0.9 BTC isn't a lot but if it was all the money you had, it wouldn't hurt to learn how to protect it instead of using windows and rush wallet.

When only the big boys can run a node because they don't actually pay for it by means of just printing more money, they can dictate which transactions will and won't be relayed.
