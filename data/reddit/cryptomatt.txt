This is a very uninformed bunch of words.  Why would you say there’s “no way you’ll ever pay it back”. That’s the whole thing.  It’s a set period of payback.  Mortgages get paid off in full every day. This whole banks suck so I can just make up stuff about how they work is getting old.  
You’re thinking more of too much credit card debt which can turn into a hole you can’t get out of.

Making less coins wouldn't be a negative to preexisting rules.  It would just make current coins more valuable.  Making unlimited coins would make all previous coins less valuable and would grandfather in an inflationary currency to all users instead of what they planned on, deflationary.

So you don't have any data and you're going off your intuition, gotcha.  Guarantee you haven't  been to the "majority" of strip clubs in the country and discovered their ownership.   I think you need to look up anecdotal evidence... You could end up being right, who knows but you still haven't shown me anything.  I've met a few owners in Chicago, Seattle and some rural areas and none of them have a gang or criminal connections.  That's doesn't mean I can speak for the majority.

Ya, a little more context.  I sent it with like a $.29 fee so it would get confirmed quickly.  You could send it for wayyyy less. It just might take a little longer to get picked up depending on traffic.  But for a drink like this, it would be acceptable for 0 confs.

I've been into mining for quite a while now and I have no idea what their hashlets even are.  Their description is so vague and "amazing" sounding, I just can't believe their real.

Is your question why is the Bitcoin ATM so complicated or why are regulations so complicated?  Because the real question is the latter.  That's why the ATM requires ID.

@_date: 2014-03-24 19:49:55
I'm sure that's true to an extent but if I go to my Chase ATM and pull out $300 there is a camera that shows me taking out the cash.  If I claim I only got, say $100 then I call up and complain.  They can check the ATM cash balance and see if it matches up right.  Just like if you tell the Walmart cashier that they shorted you $20.  They pull out the drawer and see if they're +20.  With BTC, the credit/debit card companies have no way to know/understand if the customer got defrauded or not.
@_date: 2014-10-27 03:20:56
Totally agree that a day of reckoning is coming but "Night terrors" is a bit excessive.  If your day to day life is ruined by fiat money...then you should probably take a vacation and relax.  Life is short, try to prepare for the worst but don't obsess over it.  Cheers!
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:11:31
This is very anecdotal.  "Well I've never had to do chargebacks so it's not necessary."  I agree that with most transactions there is little risk but it's definitely useful sometimes.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:04:33
As one of these "pissy scared investors", I can assure you that the government does force you to identify your customer.  You should try looking into money transmitter laws....
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:09:58
Because, you can't use your debit/credit card for a digital currency transaction.  The chargeback issue is huge.  I sell you $800 in BTC and you call your bank and claim fraud.  Not to mention the card fees

@_date: 2014-03-24 19:15:43
The biggest issue is chargebacks by the card company.  Your buying limit would be much smaller because they wouldn't want to put themselves at risk for a $1000 chargeback by Visa.  
@_date: 2014-11-01 02:06:31

Recessions are a healthy and normal process in an economy.  They obviously suck but the market needs to reset over periods.  It doesn't mean that bitcoin is dying.  It's finding its fair market value after a huge bubble.  Give it time.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:49:07
Hope you like throwing up!  Jk, welcome.  I wonder how many more people were on the sidelines and are jumping in the game?  Obviously not enough so far since the price is still finding a bottom but there's gotta be some.
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:07:55
While it's true that you can create unlimited futures contracts, that's only for a period.  Each contract has to be either canceled out (buy back your short, vice versa) or you take physical delivery before expiration.

at least bitmain has been a reputable player in the space.  I've purchased tons of stuff from them and they always delivered on time or even early.  Mining is definitely not a profitable venture at the moment though.

Ya, I've been listening to uber libertarians try to say that he can't be prosecuted for other people selling drugs on his site.  I'm not sure that really holds water.  You may not agree that online drug sales should be illegal but the fact is, it is illegal now so you can't do it.  If eBay was doing it, they would be shut down also.

I cannot believe this needs to be explained.  
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:16:12
I'm not "new" to this.  I have a masters degree in quant finance.  I'm simply telling you that if you buy property on an ocean or lake in your example, you are not guaranteed to make money on it.  
Let's say you buy ocean front property for $1 million and the community you bought in loses their major employers in the area and the local economy tanks, property value will go down and the area may never recover along with your investment because there simply isn't the demand there once was. The sea level could very well rise over the next 30 yrs also and suddenly your property is under water, literally. 
Gold peaked at $1900 6-7 yrs ago now it's $1200.  If you bought then, there's no guarantee it will ever get back there.  I happen to think it will and has long term value but who really knows.  Bitcoin may never get back to 20k. 
All I'm saying is I agree with you that generally speaking the things you listed are a good bet for the future but I feel you're greatly underestimating risk.  You can't blindly buy these things and know 100% you'll make money.
@_date: 2018-10-01 00:37:29

Investments are not synonymous with appreciating lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:50:22
There is no 100% guarantee your investment in anything will appreciate.  Not land, not gold, not anything.  You really think it’s that simple?
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:56:11
Also, you don't even start with the full 500k. The lotto discounts it for a full lump sum payment instead of installments.  After taxes and discount would be lucky to get 300 total.  Still a nice amount
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:26:16
Sure, that looks like it makes total sense ��
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:04:47
Lol what?
@_date: 2018-10-14 22:59:07
If you bought bitcoin for $1 and you bought a car when it was at $20,000 you have to pay tax on the $19,999 you gained on it.  That’s an extreme case to show the problem with your thinking

I would be pretty skeptical that any profit would be possible.  These alone will spike the difficulty. Not to mention other companies dumping more hashing power on the network.

I agree that it was bubble speculation but to say people will never touch it again is pretty bold.  Last crash went from 1100 to like 160 and then did nothing...until it went to $20k.  Once the bandwagon effect starts again, everyone will gladly get on board the hype train again lol.

I don’t know what they’re talking about lol.  Math and predicting the future are not the same thing.  I’m assuming they’re making some kind of “it’s inevitable” argument based on the past trends and slowing creation rate

Easy, it goes up because people want IN more than they want OUT.  Right now, it's the opposite
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:21:09
This is exactly what I came to say.  I think down to 3k is ok.  Below that you could do real longer term confidence damage.  If we were to go down below the old high around $1100, all bets are off.  (Disclaimer: comments are from a trading/investment perspective, not the technology.  It will be fine w/e the price does.)

It’s defacto TEMPORARY money printing.  If the institution sees they they will not meet the cash requirement anytime soon, they will just sell the assets they’re repo’ing and get permanent cash.

You calculation is very skewed. You're acting like they work only on these murals 40 hrs a week for 2 yrs.  They put in work, once for let's say a few weeks.  That's an initial investment that can continue to bring in money and they can also work on other things.

@_date: 2019-09-18 18:00:22
I'm saying it's a repo, it not a permanent money printing endeavor as is being implied by the title and many commenters.  The event that caused a spike in rates is not ordiny, no.  There is a reason the fed was forced to intervene and we should look at that. However, it's not some new QE program, or nefarious move by the fed.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:16:45
This is a repo, it’s temporary.  They’re addressing the overnight borrow rate that spiked. The question is just what caused a spike.  It’s not QE though
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:20:58
Looks like you're minting coins

Hello? What up, Parns? Yo, Samberg, what’s crackin'?
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:14:44
It’s a repo, it’s a temporary rebalancing of money at banks.  This is overhyped.  The only real question is why the overnight rate spiked causing the fed to step in
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:32:01
Well you're on Reddit, alive, having a conversation.  Seems like you want to exist at least a little or you wouldn't be here.  Sorry for your situation, stay strong.

You are assuming you are ready for them which you likely won't be.  You'll be asleep, shitting, or jerking off.  All of which do not leave you in a Navy seal readiness state.  They don't announce they're coming
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:17:58
They can if they need to. However, if they see an ongoing need for cash reserves to meet requirements, they can just sell the investments they’re repo’ing against.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:50:13
Ya man...T-shirt’s are totally the reason why a US financial services company wouldn’t want to be associated with wikileaks ��
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:46:12
Dude cmon, their “shop” isn’t illegal, that’s not what the argument is, it’s what the money from the shop is funding.  A US based money service business isn’t going to risk dealing with an organization widely thought to be interconnected with Russian interests.  If you want to find them, send your btc from coinbase to your own wallet and then send to them.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:07:38
I mean, it's a mainstream, easy way to get Bitcoin.  It operates in the US under our financial laws though.  I wish people would stop bashing them.  What exactly do people expect them to do?  Not follow laws and get shut down?  They've added so many people to the Bitcoin space.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:09:44
Dude the overwhelming majority of people don't have the skill, knowledge or time to manage private keys.  Even seasoned professionals get hacked all the time.  Look at all the exchanges and wallets that get compromised.  It only takes one error to get your address empied.

@_date: 2018-12-19 01:40:44
The point is that the average person won't be interested in it anymore.  Your potential market just shrank a ton.  Sure you could still buy btc somewhere and it's not going to die but all the people on this sub wanting to go to the moon and get a lambo go away.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:35:53
Only...so you have $1k now? Or you bought lower 
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:36:08
If the US was at the point of "banning" it, it's very likely other industrialized nations would have already done it or follow quickly.  China bans things like the weather changes and the EU is regulation central.  Plus major banks are all international.  The US could say, Oh this money came from crypto overseas, here are some fines.

I wrote an angry post about coinbase yesterday but Bitstamp is f'ed up too so it's not just them.  Really annoying though when you want to buy and can't.  
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:08:59
The grammar in the title is killing me lol.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:45:43
Yes, they will eventually allow you to set your own transaction cost and what you set it at will change how fast your transaction gets picked up by miners.  For example, a higher transaction cost would be picked up very quickly but setting it to 0 will take longer to find a miner willing to take free transactions.  It would go through at some point though.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:33:04
The "high risk" part might be coming from your bank.  Remember that coinbase uses ACH transfers for each buy and sell order.  Your bank might flag many numerous transactions coming from the same source back and forth.  If your bank flags it, then coinbase will not be able to perform the funds transfer and therefore they will flag your account.  
So, what I'm saying is you might want to contact your bank also and see if they have noted anything about these transactions because this would be a large transfer and might look fishy to a bank.  They're very sensitive to possible laundering and what not.
