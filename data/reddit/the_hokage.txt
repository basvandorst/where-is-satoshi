Crypto is considered capital in the US. Meaning, technically there's no income unless you sell.
*Edit wrong
If you exchange crypto for crypto, that's a asset swap, like bartering. Meaning, no tax.
*Edit this is not correct 
So the question I have, is do I need to pay tax if I trade my coins for a lambo? Or is that also bartering?
*Edit yes you have to pay taxes
I believe asset swaps can only be done with assets in the same class. Like trading land for other land.

Wow. That does make a lot of sense. Thank you for taking the time to type that out.

Hey OP, thank you for taking the time to make this video. 
You were pretty clear in stating that you're making a lot of assumptions and I respect that. Don't let all these arm chair quarterbacks get you down.

In the last 30 days, a total of 103 btc were donated to his vanity account. In particular, two large donations of 42 and 37 btc. 
At the current price of 16K, this is about 1.6 million USD.

Sounds like you're doing things exactly correct.

They've been saying this for over a decade iirc. Also, with national funds they are ultra conservative, and historically shown that they are willing to accept predictable losses to inflation, than risk in other assets. So I would take this news with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:06:44
Thank you.

How would you change the math? What number do you predict? 
Not trying to be snarky, just curious.

Please explain for me. I like hearing these ideas.

You're right. The IRS is pretty clear about it taxing gains on coin swaps. Bummer.

Why do you say that? Curious. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:24:04
This is also something I want to know more about. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:29:02
Yes. Correct. 
To be clear, wallets don't store the coins. They just store the keys for your bank address. So as long as you know the key, you can use any platform to access your bank account (coins). Much like knowing a website address. You can go to any computer and access the website as long as you know the address. 
Since you have a ledger, I would recommend getting ANOTHER ledger wallet, and practice restoring your wallet using your private keys.

Anyone have experience doing this?

YouTube has some great videos explaining this. 
I've found seeing a visual explanation has helped me understand concepts much faster.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:19:00
Simple multiplication. 
Right now, bitcoin is used by a very tiny fraction of a percent of people. Imagine if that usage swelled to 5% of the population. 
There are only 16m bitcoin in circulation right now. 
There are &gt;320m people in the USA and &gt;1,370m in China. 
There simply isn’t enough for everyone to have 1 btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:36
Exactly :) 
What you just wrote, would be a little different than OWNING 2% of crypto currency.

Insider trading, and pumping a value are very different. 
To answer your question, it depends on what YOUR time frame is like. 
For example, if you want to dollar cost average, and buy over time for the long hold, then you should pray for some scandals to drop the price :)
Alternatively, if you want to get out of the game, then selling into the hype, or sharp increases is in your interest. 
Currently, you can not sell naked short sales on bitcoins. This prevents the price from being artificially suppressed. 
In order to increase the price of bitcoin, someone needs to buy a lot, which in turn, legitimately increases the price. 
I don't believe there is any foul play on the price. These swings are total market sentiments. They are legit. Welcome to the show.

I'm rather new. Why do you feel that way? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:26:48
Okay, then that may take several days. Transferring money between banks has counterparty risk. So sometimes, a value isn't credited to our account, until the funds clear the previous bank. 
On top of that, Coinbase is flooded with new account and activity. Wouldn't surprise me to see their system slow. 
I've been waiting on a response for over a week now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:58:40
Make a Coinbase account anyway. If you end up finding another solution while waiting for your ability to trade, then awesome. 
Getting coins out of Coinbase is rather quick and easy. 
There have been a couple post on here that explain how. Here is [one I found]( It's an easy work around to avoid the withdraw fee Coinbase charges (this is on top of the normal btc transfer fee). 
More on Localbitcoins: You can wire/transfer to people around the world. I think Localbitcoins also uses an escrow service, which holds the money until the bitcoin transfer clears. I haven't tried it though. The website has a good review system for buyers and sellers.

OP implies that wealth swings are a zero sum game. Which I disagree with. To increase wealth, most businesses need to provide a desired service or product, which customers voluntarily exchange for. Their net impact to their employees and customers is positive. 
Sure there are exceptions of crooked organizations, but I believe that's a small minority, primarily concentrated in government and financial entities. The "Federal" Reserve for example.

Whenever btc has reached new heights, especially at this speed, there is always a strong correction. 
My biggest recommendation is dollar cost averaging. 
I personally, am waiting. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:26:26
Let's hope so. 
It would be nice to have another 5 years to invest before btc gets too mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:47:51
Ah, yes. That makes a lot of sense. Convert all BTC to LTC and then convert back again. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:59:03

With your private key, you can restore a wallet. 
Each private key is associated with only one public address. 
Does this answer your questions?

1.) Coinbase use to be the answer, but they are flooded with new users. I recommend localbitcoin instead. You can meet someone in person, have them transfer you btc, and you hand them cash. 
2.) 
3.) Don't stress the price. Bitcoin is still VERY difficult to understand and use. You are still way ahead of the general population. Hopefully by the time you feel comfortable making your first purchase, the price will correct back down to 9k.
