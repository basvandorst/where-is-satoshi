One is a Bitcoin and one is a shitcoin.

I'd be salty too if my hodlings consisted of a paper clip, 72 cents, and a used tampon strong.

Hey man, also a hodler since 2015. Glad to see other people hodling up during this blood bath. I'm the same way, each time I get scared I remember celebrating $3k back in June or so. Hell, I remember celebrating $1k (for the second time) not too long ago. 
HODL strong gentlemen, we're still up for the month too lol.

Get an offline wallet like electrum, or get a ledger nano. No need to provide personal information for wallets like that.
Plenty of places online to purchase BTC without SSN as well. Check sidebar!

I'm in it for both. The US Dollar is a very stable currency as well. So I like to have lots of it. 
I also like to have Bitcoin in my vault too - because it's an important currency in my eyes.

You're damn right that you did, and it's the best decision you've ever made

The only action you can perform with an address is a send.
If you want to receive Bitcoin, someone has to send it to your address. If you want to send someone Bitcoin, you have to send it to their address. That's the only way I can explain this. Don't overthink it, champ.

Panic bought or panic sold?

I came here specifically to check this. Coinbase has been frozen now for over an hour.

Difference between Bitcoin and Trump? 
I can say I support one of them without looking and feeling like a complete fool.

Terrible idea. 0/10 would recommend.

Every payment I have accepted over the past year as a freelance social media influencer has been in BTC. PayPal kept fucking me so I moved to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:35:16
It was an accident. I do online business and only take BTC as payment. Had a couple coins since $700 last year, and just rode the wave.
So my net worth has been made by BTC.

Your electrum fee + what you're trying to send is larger than your actual balance.

Why? It doesn't matter what his intentions are - if the price pumps and the trader makes money then what makes a person dumb for paying attention? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:42:06
There's no luck, it's just a matter of being smart. You buy before the pump and sell before the dump. Your argument would hold up if people were buying in not aware of what the intentions were. If someone actually believed mcafee's call, and held long term then perhaps they'd get burned, but I still don't understand how being one step ahead of a pump is a bad thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:16:37
Right, that leaves .00101933 on a fee, but Electrum's suggested minimum fee exceeds .00101933 BTC so you don't have the funds required to send that much BTC

Just reading this, I feel like you aren't a developer.
