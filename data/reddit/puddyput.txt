What exactly makes us believe what this guy wrote?

I'm pretty sure Tim Berners-Lee created the first web browser. He invented HTML.

Enough to hurt me but not enough to ruin me if I lost them or they lost value

My personal experience:
While people in Germany know bitcoin exists for quite a while now, they treated it as a curiosity so far. In the last three weeks I have been been thoroughly questioned about bitcoin by three different groups of people. One of them messaged me just now asking about online shops that accept btc to enjoy the recent gains in value. I'm optimistic :)

My bank is a Sparkasse as well. I buy bitcoins by directly contacting a guy in the Netherlands, we agree on a rate, I transfer the money (SEPA) and when he received it he sends me the coins. I am doing this since ~1 year. They started blocking the transactions claiming the account I want to send to is flagged as related to fraud. I had to speak to 4 different persons before they let my transfer go through, I told them I want all future transactions to go through as well but I am not sure yet if that helped... Digging their own graves!

There is a German Nethack server which sort of does it. Players can deposit treasures containing btc and others can find it. Nethack is a roguelike game.

Better safe than sorry I guess. I like how much trust there still is in this fast growing community with people helping each other out etc. Surely this is going to change the more people participate. I try to be friendly and cautious at the same time. But yeah, banks blocking transfers, especially cross border, is a thing.
