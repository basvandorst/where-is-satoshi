I'm thinking about selling coins/buying ETF in order to at least partially move my bitcoin exposure into a Roth IRA.  But that's basically net-0 gain for bitcoin price. I'd be curious to see if it brings new users, or more investment from existing holders. 
One thing I would note is that it seems like most analysts attribute the rise in gold backed ETFs to the improved liquidity =&gt; increased volatility. I haven't really seen any analysis relating to tax sheltered investments.

i wonder how much bitcoin is lost in old change tip accounts, probably millions of dollars worth
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:45:47
Yeah, the no-tipping aspect is the best part of the UBER experience. No way am I supporting this. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:49:41
seems to suggest the opposite.

Tips jars at any counter job are just ridiculous. All they did was press 5 buttons! It's basically begging and the owners should feel ashamed that they are paying their employees so little that they have to beg.

Tipping in the US is not really about showing gratitude it's about people bending to the pressure of social expectations. People tip for bad service here just because they feel like that have to.

Yeah that didn't make any sense to me. Just because you're in public doesn't mean you can't be blackmailed. What's to stop the public witness from being corrupted?

Fingerprint verification would be awesome

Let's dispell with this fiction that Marco Rubio knows what bitcoin is.

The hosting/payment was flawless! The video is pretty expensive at 25c and BTW that is total BS that 1 paid view = 50 ad supported views. Youtube ad revenue/view varies depending on a few factors but a rate of $1/200 views is completely unheard of. It's much closer to $1/1000 which, if you're trying to compare apples to apples in terms of 1:50 is 5 cents per bitcoin micropayment.

It seems like for 6/9 those points you could substitute "bitcoin" for LN and be just a few years behind the debate.

 here is the bill:  
regarding the limit and a potential multiple transaction loophole:


from gross income under subsection (a) with
respect to a sale or exchange shall not exceed $600.


this subsection, all sales or exchanges which are part
of the same transaction (or a series of related 
transactions) shall be treated as one sale or exchange. 
and then further down there is a note that it adjusts with cost of living rounded to the nearest $50. It is also retroactive but only to Dec 2017.

I bought near the peak in the last bubble and have held since so if you're in it for the long haul just remember it could be a few years.

I thoguht thet same thing, from the top two google results,


[**Schnorr** (signatures)](
you should really just read this article but my ELI5 is that Schnorr signatures reduce storage and bandwidth by an estimated 25% by allowing users who spend from many addresses to one address to do so using just 1 signature for all of the transactions. In the existing system, if they spend from 20 addresses to one address they pay for 20 transactions. There is an added bonus of a layer of privacy that can be leveraged by using Schnorr signatures.

in the news tomorrow: swedish guy brags about btc wealth, armed robbers subsequently steal coins at gunpoint.   
Either this or friends and family just start begging for money and guilt tripping.

mine would probably be lost. If you think about it, that is a good reason to consider moving out of out of actual coins and into an ETF bitcoin price tracker. That way it's tied to a brokerage account which will pass on.    
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:33:05
they have said they will provide both coins, but the controversy is about which chain they will call BTC

She's so forcefully animated that it's distracting. I'm left wondering if any of that was natural behavior and not her politician's mask.

The total supply is 21 million. a lot of people bought 21 coins back when they were cheap so they could own a millionth of the total BTC.

I'm probably too late, moved into multisig vault though.  I hadn't logged on for a while and I went to buy some coins and it's forcing me to tell them my occupation as well as my employer, wth!? They don't even have anything close to my job on their list so I'm literally unable to answer truthfully and buy coins...

Coinmap is telling the truth, Seattle is woefully underrepresented.  I got coffee at moondrop once, I was the first and probably only person to have ever paid with btc. Fuel sports bar apparently takes it, never been though. Hopefully 2015 brings some new shops onboard.

When you used their recovery tool did it seem immediately responsive?  I can't seem to get passed the public key input phase.  I let it sit for 10 minutes, also double checked my xpub key inputs.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:32:42
aren't they essentially already out though if i have the multisig keys?

they should have defined a specific amount of bitcoin rather than dollars

Same, I've given away to at least 5 people and all lost the keys when they bought new phones.
