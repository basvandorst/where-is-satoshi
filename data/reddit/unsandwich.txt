1. What happened in the past is not a guarantee of the future.
2. Author transformed the data to fit hypothesis.
3. Author sees a pattern when there may not be one.
4. Ignores the possibility of a black swan event that could collapse the system inside or out.

A phone wallet is going to be a higher risk. People break and lose their phones all the time. Thanks for making the mistake for me.

If the U.S. stopped printing money for itself, would that kill the value of it? Not really. Nobody knows how far adoption will be when that happens.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:13:30
More buyers entering the Bitcoin market does not increase the probability of the price going up.
The hype is starting to wear off.

No. I'll just find the cheapest way to hold onto my private keys.

Sell your coins. They aren't real.

Theres a 56% chance of a price decrease tomorrow. 89% chance of a price decrease given there is high volume. Time to wait.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:56:25
People will get bored reading about Btc and the price will go back to 400. Give it a week.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:47:30
No. Don't be a socialist.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:08:04
"Don't invest dollars for pennies" 1000 was already high. If you used a great chunk of your available trading monies, you made TWO mistakes. That said, you might as well wait it out now. Lots of people are going to take advantage of this crash and come out ahead.

If you used patience in the first place, and risk adverse strategy, this is like christmas again. Just wait 4 days, everyone will forget about this and all the smart people will be ever richer.

You will definitely regret that trade.

Your argument is based on multiple assumptions. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:47:50
Open information for as much as possible. Provide more benefits/value to the system than negatives.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:29:39
The price may decrease some more. There is no indication that its going back up in the next ten days. Time to wait some more. If there is high volume the chance of a price drop is much greater atm. Beware. The key to doing well is realizing when there is a major market shift. Usually when you feel it, it looks good on the graph or statistically, and something major happened in the news. its going to be a bumpy ride for it to keep increasing every week. Wait a little and then hold on.

Once you pop, the fun don't stop.

Exactly this. It would have to stay at 400-500 for a month or more before people got really worried.

@_date: 2013-12-09 15:23:38
I believe you could. I think you can on BTC-E. The price will be less though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:24:23
People are making a killing right now by trading the massive daily price changes. Its created an oppurtunity for people with less money to buy more BTC. Definitely not over. You could hold for a week or trade heavily and come out ahead. If you are going to have a negative attitude you will not be able to trade well.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:20:08
This is such a fake story
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:45:06
A full exchange lets you trade for multiple currencies (BTC-E). Other sites may only let you buy or sell for USD (Coinbase).
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:36:06
The fluctuation USD/BTC will cause bitcoin to be unusable as a payment system for normal products. The chaotic trading will begin to affect outside currencies in a negative way. Only those who have knowledge and luck will have an advantage.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:41:29
Also, if you can't find it, there are utilities that can recover deleted files and they work well. That would take a little more effort and searching.

People would stop using Coinbase and trade elsewhere. Bitcoin goes anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:10:37
If you hold bitcoin you really have the same amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:11:43
Bitcoin. The more I researched other coins the more I realized that they are only propped up by Bitcoin adoption. Thats not to say you can't speculate on others, but they are harder to trade and more affected by scheming of small groups.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:46:18
Dump it all. It could only be worth a fraction of that next week.

Pump and dump
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:45:11
I use Cryptocoin charts. Then I compute the probability of a rise or fall by hand using 24 hours of data (candlesticks). Baye's formula can add conditionals, like if there is a high volume spike or if you had a way to compute the number of good news / bad news articles. I'm working on my own system as a guide...but nobody can predict the future. Its better to think of it like a multiplayer game with a lot of hype atm. For the day, it looks like 36% chance of a price increase.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:33:01
Bitcoin is for gambling. So you don't have a logical argument.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:51:38
You are trying to apply a narrative to something nobody has proven yet. Think of all the different technology platforms that died out in that time.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:14:54
The fact that you have to pay $800+ to get one.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:45:02
The estimated value will be very high, 10k to a million dollars, depending on adoption. But that is a guess. Definitely worth it in the long term. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:01:38
I'm going to buy a shitload at $500 but if I don't, I'm still okay. Everything is WIN/WIN.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:38:25
Lots of computer literate people I talked to didn't know what Bitcoin is yet. Its still early. We experienced some media hype and some sell outs. The network is still there and I think the demand is still growing there.
That said, everyone probably should have sold when it hit 1200. Look at what a little bad news can do...
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:54:34
No thanks its my coins, I do what I want.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:05:05
If you use statistics for the past 5 days its obviously slowed down and the sells are getting bigger.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:53:31
I agree, the value is built into the system. The fact that its the most popular is where its at though. I doubt another crypto-currency will find mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:26:32
They don't keep their exchanges in sync. People can see the prices on different sites simultaneously on Cryptocoin charts website to gauge value. The price stays generally the same due to demand. But if something goes wrong with say Mt. Gox, it seems to affect the entire market. And yes you could send money to a different exchange and get a better price potentially, and keep doing that to make money.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:37:44
Bitcoin is what the US government wants. A stable global currency that people use USD with. This will increase democracy and peace all around the globe. It will override smaller governments currency and reverse oppression. Anyway, Police don't have the resources to capture it all. I truly don't believe they have any intention to hurt bitcoin. The banks may not like it, but the real people / government will want it for political stability. it will obviously be outlawed some places, but it won't be destroyed. Its pretty controversial so who knows...

Its a speculation game.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:21:21
People aren't born into understanding that things can change value over time. Writing and computer systems allow us to buy/sell at different times for the best price. Bitcoin is better than a stock because there is no worry that company will have to turn a profit to increase value. It is a bunch of middle men acting in their own interest for the coins or for goods and services. Inherently, Bitcoin is a highly valued, technological monetary system that doesn't rely on a printer, government, or backed standard. The cash is generated when someone pays for it.
