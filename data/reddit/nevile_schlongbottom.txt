Doesn't opening channels to an exchange feel very centralised to you?

I haven't been following this debate too closely so I don't really have a side, but if shuffling coins between addresses is enough to cause problems, doesn't that show a big weakness in the network? Bitcoin should be robust enough to handle "attacks" like that. Bitcoin should be in favour of more transactions, even if the user is just wasting their transaction fees flipping coins between addresses

Thanks guys, I'm glad you agreed with what I was saying. I thought it was promising that most people seemed to open to the idea of bitcoin after you talk for a bit. We'll get to mainstream some day

The day encryption is broken, Bitcoin is broken. Anyone could transfer funds from any address without the private key

Yeah credit cards are fine, but I think it’s important to have an anonymous option as well. If credit cards are the only option for payment in the future, every transaction goes through a private company, and I think that gives way too much power to them and the government. I think having some privacy is important. I agree that that’s probably not a feature that will make typical consumers start using crypto, but I think it is essential to avoiding some crazy 1984 level stuff in the future

The thing is that it seems like society is quickly moving in a cashless direction. Cash is of course ideal for anonymous transactions, but it’s good to have a digital alternative. Especially since bitcoin can be exchanged without meeting in person as well
