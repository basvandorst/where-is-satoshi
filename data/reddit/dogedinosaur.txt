I don't get upset when i'm being tipped less than 1 dollar from 1 million people, i might like even 1 cent from 100 million or less. So whoever does it or in any amount, still counts in my books as generous. The times we are living now which make this functionality possible are amazing! Not everyone lives in US. Great pic op.

Does this mean you don't need to exchange crypto-currency to cash anymore because you can buy legally everything you want with any business that implements cryptocurrency, because now it's legal? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Meaning that you don't need to go through a payment processor, you can pay directly!

Congrats :). Never had gold before.  
**EDIT: Ty so much.**  
Also, to tell you my story, i am actually a complete noob at trading and lost some, up to a K$, but hey, poorly new myself to trading and uninformed decisions with added 90% emotions based on my limited resources , made me thought that this is not for me, but i'm happy for you and other people who made it *right*. Much luck in the future too and even more health.
