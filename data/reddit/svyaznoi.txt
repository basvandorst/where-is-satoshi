Well, I'm Russian (learned about this whole thing by lurking on habrhabr.ru) so my experience is different (Russian corporations are very.... special flowers) but I think they did here is unprecedented.
From the top of my head I can't remember anyone doing this  thing to a broken brand. Probably because usually a broken brand is worthless (megaupload being broken yet not worthless makes this thing special).
This will bite them in the ass if megaupload case holds in court and Kim gets extradited. The similarity will make constructing a similar case against megareload so much easier

Hey Rand, I have a question:
Do you guys de-duplicate (Mega does  ) ? Because searching for duplicates is essentially the same thing as searching for illicit files (you need to upload a file you know to be "non-grata" , and find its duplicates. BAM!), and I don't like that.
I realize that using salts and "straightforward" key management (and thus removing de-dup possibility) would squeeze your datacenter something fierce so it will mean severe limitations / high price, but frankly, if you don't de-dup (and thus can't preemptively scan), then I'm with ya.
One more thing I wanted to ask. Will there be an "uploader incentive" scheme a-la old megaupload ?
I hoped that Mega will have it, but alas, it does not :(

Personally, I think what happened here is not so much trademark infringement as some kind of trademark necromancy.
And necromancy is cool in my book.
