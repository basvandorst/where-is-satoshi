Thanks, that's a pretty good idea. It ties up some BTC for me, but I guess it's about the same as them just sitting around my wallet.

Thanks, I put it in and given the current trend in difficulty it seems impossible to see ROI 
But I think if the difficulty doesn't increase exponentially, that I'll generate about 130% ROI

Even KNC miners (just shipping) won't be profitable in a month at the current rate. I think plenty of people will go offline when their power costs are greater than their earning potential. It's always good to have another opinion though, thanks for the advice. I'm still debating this.

If every american (350 million) had an equal piece of the bitcoin market then that would be about roughly 12million/350million= .0342btc/person. So as this takes off and more people start to buy bitcoin the price will continue to rise because of the limited supply. In a year from now you shouldn't regret not  buying at least a little when it was only $400.

My understanding is that we choose how much to send, right? How can I physically choose to send only .00001 instead of the default? I use multibit, if I used qt could I just change a setting?

If the difficulty is rising exponentially(?) Why is the projected increase only 6% on

Lol, everyone I've told about bitcoin since my excitement over the 120 to 200 jump has been saying this. I don't think banking on a "huge crash" is a wise thing to do.
