[J. Crew has an awesome tall section]( Great quality and style.
[LL Bean]( has a good tall section as well.
[APC jeans are good for tall people]( Of course, there's always [Levis](
If that isn't enough, there's [a whole subreddit dedicated to tall people's clothes](
I doubt any of these retailers accept bitcoin—yet.
Hope this helps!

Nice post.
Hoarders gonna hoard. Nobody's spending them, only speculating. How can people sell things for bitcoins if the price fluctuates so wildly? Who's gonna spend them if they could be worth "*billions*" someday?
A decentralized exchange seems to be the appropriate solution to a decentralized currency. I have no idea what this would look like, or if it's even possible. Maybe being able to exchange within the Bitcoin client? A whole other can of worms, I'm sure…
Thanks for this.
EDIT: Clarity.

When it's no longer cost-effective, people will stop mining and the difficulty will go down.
Isn't this how it's designed?

Yeah, but is there any reason to trust Mt. Gox? Can't they manipulate the prices and we would be none the wiser?

According to whom? Are they trustworthy/transparent?
Not trolling, just asking.
