Well no, if you think bitcoin is going up, in years or not, you still care about price level. This idea that price is irrelevant is ridiculous. If price is irrelevant then would you still hold it in 10 years if it stays depressed at under 1000? Maybe you would but it's not irrelevant. 
If you want to hold it what are you holding it for? What price or market value do you think it will have in 20 years time. If you think it could go to 100,000 let's say, is that when you would sell and take out. Whatever your time period you still care about price. If you really think it's going up, I would want to buy as much as I can at the lowest price level possible, so that when it did reach new heights my holdings are exponentially bigger then if I buy 1 bitcoin for 5000 or 5 bitcoins for 1000

The question is not whether it's a tetracement. For anyone who believes in bitcoin, what's important is what is it retracing too. That chart you showed me, has two lines. One at 4500 and one at 1200. Big difference for buying back. And also time period is key. Typical retracmenta I've seen are 75 per cent but can last up to 120 weeks. With an average of 72 weeks. 
So when do you buyback? And how long do you hold or wait ?

And what do you think it could go to in the future. At what point would you sell ?

Ofcourse no one knows. But you have to attempt to have a go. It's not to say you know 100 per cent with any uncertainty but you look at what you have got and ask, when should I put back in....

What I'm saying is, this idea you just buy and hold is fine if you are buying an index and plan on using it for retirement in 45 years time and don't think the stock market is going away,
But this is completely different so you have to have some idea of what price you would sell at even if it's 20/30 years away.

Ok so would you buy more now ?
