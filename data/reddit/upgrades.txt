Yep!  
I was banned for explaining how their insurance fund, paid for by liquidations barely ever has a day..and I mean this is super rare..where they have to payout more than they take in, and on those few days the amount is very small, and how in the real world real insurance companies would never be allowed to make the killing that bitmex is making from their "insurance" all at the expense and to the detriment of their own clients. The moderator actually said he agreed and seconds later I was banned. I couldn't even see a notice within the chat announcing it - just the pop-up when I tried to write my next message..
These people are really fragile to any criticism it seems..at least some of the chat mods are.

Thanks for this info! I'll take a look right now.

Thank you so much for this guide :) After some research I've figured this out - My difficulties lied in Coinbases still-broken ID verification system that tons of people cannot get to work. People have been complaining for over a year as far as I could find in their forums and are still having problems to this day. I've found local ATM's for bitcoin, but the fees kill, so I'm getting setup with Kraken now. I got the Ledger Nano, which I love. As far as Bitwage goes - I love the concept, but I'd prefer the option to choose a set $$ amount to invest in BTC every paycheck, instead of choosing a set amount of BTC as it fluctuates so greatly and I need to know how much is going out from my check. If you had it setup this way instead, I could have my direct deposit split in two - My normal amount going to my personal bank, and then the other amount for bitcoin going to the other bank for bitwage. I'm not willing to send my full check through another service so I can get a small amount of bitcoin, causing my paycheck to also be delayed.

This is JUST for bitcoin though, right? Or is it a mix of many diff. cryptos? Like the Lawnmower app has a hypothetical cryto currency etf that would be so cool to have.

Wow, 108 to 130 in 10 days time is pretty damned good. Easy 20%. That's impressive. I'll definitely be placing some funds in here.

You can hedge it by using options on Deribit (they have the closest I've seen to a 'real' options exchange that I've seen) or use Bitmex's version of options. 
Both of these exchanges would need to be accessed with a VPN if you're American but neither of them ask for any identification documents and registration is super fast and easy. I highly suggest you check the option strike prices available on Deribit..I think the furthest out strike prices are sometime in March 2019. Continually sell calls on a shorter term basis for continued income or buy some puts for whatever date / strike price suits your needs.

Right! CFT / CMT certifications are only for losers who are dumb enough to pay a bunch of $ to take classes and an industry recognized certification test for a bunch of black magic bullshit. Nobody's ever made a dollar with crap like Fibonacci retracements / extensions, moving averages, and "candlestick patterns"..doji candles are totally useless amirightguys?

Claims like this deserve a better explanation above and beyond the claim itself that it's overvalued...like maybe some explanation as to how you *know* better than the market as a whole what it's value should be / what it is apparently supposed to be based upon in order to explain why price needs to come down. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:13:51
It absolutely does. The attempts at a selloff have all been rather weak and defeated by buyers with relative ease. Not enough incoming buyers to push over that $6800 level lately, so it definitely appears that there is some strong accumulation of positions at this low to mid 6k level before the final push out of this consolidation zone.

Credit expansion is as it sounds...expanding the amount of debt held by businesses and the public through loans, etc. With a gold backed currency you cannot just print more money as needed to aide in the expansion of this credit without simultaneously purchasing more gold to match the newly created additional currency. 
Another thing is that with the US being the world reserve currency, we can't be on the gold standard. To have our money out around the world being held by many other countries we HAVE TO be running a trade deficit. If we were on the gold standard we would have sent away all our gold and our system would have collapsed long ago. others would turn in their USD for gold, and we'd have shipped out all of our gold. Also, gold is priced by international demand levels and we can't have that determining the purchasing power of our dollars as we'd lose control over our economy and our ability to actively adjust the money supply levels which is an essential tool of the Fed to use for trying to maintain a stable economy.

That RSI pattern doesn't point to anything, other than a series of lower highs. This is not a 'triple top' - it's a series of lower highs. If you notice, when price gets lower it is quickly bought into, leaving a longer wick. This is a sign that there's strong buying at these lower levels. 
From my observation over this past month or two, this thing is going to break to the upside. Strong accumulation is taking place in the low 6s as much as possible without buying pressure continuing as heavily in the mid to high 6's..I think one decent catalyst that helps bring in more money from those watching price action very closely with their fingers on the trigger, just waiting on the sidelines for the sign of an uptrend beginning once again will finally send us up and out of this wedge. Market sentiment seems to be thinking the same from my personal  observations of various chat rooms and forums.
If you look at the 'Wall Street Cheat Sheet' chart (easily found with google image search - srry on mobile or I'd link it) which points out market sentiment / the mood and thoughts of the masses during boom and bust price action, it's pretty damn spot on in terms of matching the exact price movement of bitcoin from approx early 2017 to today, and it shows an uptrend beginning here soon if it continues to follow the same pattern as it has been to a remarkable degree so far.

I'm more of a fan of just the wishbone of the chicken for my price direction confirmation test. I'm a scalper, too, on 3 minute charts exclusively. Just bought my first batch of fertilized eggs and built a coup in my back yard - the baked chicken from Vons were getting expensive and I didn't wanna have to keep moving to a 5 minute chart when supplies got low. Gotta pay to play, ya know?

Yes..bitcoin ATM's can be found throughout every big city / metro area in the US. Go to  to locate crypto ATM's along with info on the coins available at which machines and live buy / sell rate details on some of the machines. 
Tip for those who haven't used these much but would like to: it is generally smart to call / contact the ATM company (contact info for the company is listed on site I linked above on each ATM's information page) you're going to and make sure the ATM is in fact still at that location and is currently working. These machines have a lot of problems and often are out of order. 
When selling to an ATM: ALWAYS call ahead of time to make sure the machine you want to go to has enough funds available to process your sell. I have to make a approx. 20 minute drive to my closest sell ATM and it's super irritating to find it doesn't work / doesn't have enough $ when you arrive. 
Fees: For making a purchase, the lowest I've seen is 5%. I also have 7.5%, 9%,  and 10% machines near me. The machines that let you sell usually have a sell rate fee a couple points lower than their buy rate. Either way, pay very close attention because some ATMs have beyond ridiculous % fees.
This is from my experience with multiple ATM manufacturers / service providers at locations throughout the San Fernando Valley in L.A.

How is someone trading gold illegal...what makes a trade okay and what makes a trade an 'illlegal black market trade' - you keep saying this but the problem is none of us understand what that actually means. What's the difference between a legal and an illegal trade..??
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:50:16
Yeah...that would take people actually being stupid enough to just submit their fiat for his coin on a worldwide scale. Never ever happening 
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:38:15
You've completely missed everything I said. The USD clearly cannot be called similar to gold. Re-read to my comment you're responding to explaining why the USD had to be taken off of the gold standard
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:12:29
That's not a lot of gold...tell me, how do you manipulate a country's currency with a couple million dollars of gold?
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:29:48
I literally answered your question in the comment you are replying to...Did you not just read exactly what I posted about why a gold-backed currency does not work for the US? This also means using the gold itself would not work..as the paper is just a gold-equivelant because it's easier and safer to use day to day..
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:07:42
That's not manipulating a market...everyone knows what the value of gold is and what the value of a currency is because we have international trade markets that anyone can see these prices with. Who was hurt by this? A couple million dollars in gold is a drop of water in an ocean 
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:31:03
No different from any other nation's own currency 
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:33:05
What the hell are you talking about??

Not really, because the public needs morphine. Gold is an asset that is traded on an international market and people can buy as much gold as they want. If he was not paying his taxes on his profits, then sure that should be illegal, but cornering a market is not illegal. Read up on the Hunt brothers who tried (and did for a period of time) cornered the silver market and made and then lost huge amounts of money. My point is, commodities markets are meant to be played by traders with the goal of making money. Gold is a commodity and is not needed by the general public to survive like morphine actually is needed. 
It sounds like there's no limit on how much gold a person Is allowed to have..so him having a lot (you keep calling it hoarding, like having a lot of gold is a bad thing) shouldn't be a bad thing either. It sounds like he was smart and made some smart, aggressive investments to me. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:31:18
It's not viable for 99% of people because 99% of people just wants something that works - they don't want to wait 30 minutes+ for buying a cup of coffee, they don't want to accidentally type a wrong digit in an address and lose their $, they don't want their money to wildly fluctuate in value on a day to day basis..You have to have non-zealots willing and able to use it because it just makes sense compared to their other options and it's not even close right now
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:13:08
Sounds like he is a good trader to me. Anywhere else this man would be given a job as a commodities trader with a bank. Outsmarting your competition and making smart investments should not be illegal. You keep saying black market...black market just means an unofficial market (usually for illegal  items such as drugs and guns) but could also be like me trading gold directly with you instead of on a public exchange, but nobody would get in trouble for doing so because gold is not illegal. If he didn't pay any taxes that's a whole different problem..the gold in that case is not a problem, but cheating on your taxes would be.

Ya I'm tired of the obvious manipulation in BTC. Markets don't naturally rise and fall so dramatically, interspersed by periods of general stability. This shit doesn't trend at all. Just flat nothing followed by fomo after the whales make their moves. I'm thinking of only trading actual currencies moving forward that at least have a fucking direction and reasons behind their moves that the public is able to follow. Crypto has way too much non-public info controlling price movement (whales controlling movement on their whims, insider trading at coinbase befor BAT listing, the bcash war..why would ANYONE want a currency that can be fought over / controlled by a handful of individuals or small groups?) 
I continue to believe that without regulation or some type of serious consequences then this space will be doomed to fail as rogue / wealthy / deceitful parties use these markets as their personal play-things.

They do in a roundabout way...no deposits to your bank = no loans made by your bank. Deposits don't just sit in a vault, going completely unused whether that be as collateral or for any other transactions a bank ultimately uses as a means to create loans or to invest in securities (which is basically the same thing as providing a loan.. youre providing someone else financing in hopes of a return)
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:56:46
I guess that's one way to stop a panic sell-off...
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:14:04
Your money being devalued is not because of gold traders unless that one gold trader had enough money to buy a very very large percentage of all the gold available in Iran, which I very highly doubt.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:19:30
So because he traded gold with people without the government knowing about it he is a criminal? You've repeated yourself many times but still have not explained what about his actions was something that was harmful to others or something that would be considered fraudulent or illegal elsewhere in the world

You know the Yuan is basically pegged to the USD itself, right? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:01:12
What the hell are 'exporting stocks'? And you have it backwards - imports and exports follow the dollars value, as US products become more expensive around the world as USD goes up and cheaper as it goes down, so the US exports more when dollar value is low. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:04:33
You realize this is how markets work, right? People sell shit when it's losing value and buy something that holds it's value instead so they can avoid being dirt poor. I guess this guy was a real scumbag for not wanting his money to be completely worthless, right?

Make sure you've got the app updated fully.
