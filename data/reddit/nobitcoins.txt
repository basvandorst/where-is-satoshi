Ron Paul supporting Creationism doesn't affect you personally though. It's not like you own a bunch of evolution stock. And Ron Paul probably wouldn't try to silence evolution or ban the theory.

 If you bought a bitcoin for 30 cents in 2010 as joke and you now just realized that 30 cents is worth 10k by gosh darn golly you worked for every penny!

My favorite part is seeing the pro crypto and pro rump supporters act baffled. Anyone with half a brain that follows politics could have told you this would be his stance years ago. Dude has a selfish dictator personality. You think he cares crypto has many US investors and companies in the space now who stand to lose a lot if sudden unfavorable changes take place? nope.

Give it time. Usually when he tweets about something it means he is ready to push some agenda as we seen with tariffs, healthcare, immigration, farmer bailout, on and on. Practically all of his policy stance tweets are followed up with some news of something being done.

Can I buy 1 bitcoin for 30 cents? for old times' sake?

Nah, they would always choose rump over anything that benefits them. Even if he banned bitcoin and their net worth went to zero they would still get down on both knees.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:11:36
lmao at all the rump supporters who also like bitcoin.

For the past decade 94% of the jobs being created are temporary contract work not stable long lasting jobs with benefits or retirement in mind. Most are low paying no benefit jobs. Gig work.

Why do you think it's hard for big companies and investment firms to offer bitcoin? They don't like liabilities. Uncertainty is a liability. 
Why do you think there are no tax benefits like the traditional 401k or IRA both have?
Until crypto has clear guidelines it will never be mentioned in the same breath as traditional offerings. 
Yang will help push it in the right direction.

Debt disappears. Debt is not bad.
If person A borrows $20 from person B and person A never pays person B back. Person B is shit out of luck but person A probably used that $20 to create economic activity. 
And Most debt doesn't carry over after a person passes away unless it's tied to assets being passed down.
Actually all the debt you speak of wont matter in a few generations.  Almost nobody alive today is paying for debts of their great grandfathers. All that shit was written off by dead people. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:48:30
Wrong.  Person B transferred value to the borrower. That $20 he loaned out was just sitting in his pocket doing nothing.
