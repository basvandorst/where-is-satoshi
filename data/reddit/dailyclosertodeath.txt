Buy the dip
@_date: 2019-07-25 11:06:37
It never fails!
All I have to do is initiate a transfer to my crypto exchange and the price jumps up again.
Buy the dips they said.... It will average out they said.....
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:13:12
Can we get me a feel good meme when I catch the dip before the actual minimum? :P

I went to London recently and I really wished I saw some adoption there.
This sub helped me set up my Coinami wallet and I took some with me. Kept looking out for *any place* that would accept it, even got bold enough to ask a few store owners if they did... Blank faces.
Man it was really amazing though, to have that currency in my wallet, available, ready to spend. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:26:35
You're not kidding!
I mentioned my visit and query about BTC on and I was basically heckled off and told to quit my fantasy world. Brutal!
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:43:22
How about over the past 12 months?
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:28:51
How much did they mine before abandoning?

Bottlecaps FTW!
(If it works in Fallout it can work irl)
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:30:02
Only for a short time.
Then around March 2019, the 12 month should be fine again.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:00:04
Funny now. But this joke will be hackneyed and passé. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:49:04
I love London. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:26:46
The past dozen times I've sent bitcoin the transaction appeared on my Trezor within a minute or two and was confirmed in about an hour.
Is there any reason why it's taking so long today? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:52:33
You already said that. I'm not refuting it. I asked you a question.




@_date: 2018-08-26 14:10:36
So what happens if the cost of mining is more expensive than an actual bitcoin (which I think is what your chart is pointing out)?
Why mine then? Hope?
@_date: 2018-08-10 00:14:02
Not good.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:23:27
That's one kidney, part of a liver, one cornea.... Blood donations.... Bone marrow.... That's it. I'm done. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:20:13
This will become believable to me when BTC price rises but BCH price drops, consistently.

Remind me! 142 days
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:45:34
Guess again. But I doubt with your prejudice you'll come close to the truth.
But if that image helps you sleep better at night, makes you feel better about yourself, you go right on ahead and keep thinking that.
Out with the Drumpf in 2020.
And Mitch McConnell as well as all the other Russian traitors as well.
Good riddance.
Have a nice life.

I'm out of the loop...
What's this hype about a reveal today on the "true identity of SN" all about?
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:05:01
People keep their coins on exchanges?? Like the majority of BTC owners or "some people"?
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:50:52
No, from wf to cb. 
Fiat transfer to purchase crypto.

More germs on paper currency than digital ��
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:57:49
And wire transfer fees for US are minimum $5
So what's the point? You're forced to stay on Coinbase despite the fee raise.
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:52:22
Also started the binance.us ball rolling in case, like you said, kraken pulls the same stunt.
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:58:21
I don't know how you get it that quickly. It takes my transfers from WF 5 business days.
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:47:43
Thank you. I appreciate this and I'm feeling  the same way in my thoughts as well. Been with CB for a while.
I did up my kraken status to intermediate though. They made it easy.
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:47:04
You CAN buy shares in precious metals. But you can actually buy the actual metal as well. I've owned a kilo gold bar. I've held one in my hands and kept  it in my house. 
I also have cryptocurrency. I don't consider it a computer program. It is a ledger system that is open sourced and kept track of by everyone in the system. There is a program that defines the ledger and how any computer can also keep track of that ledger but a single or partial bitcoin in and of itself is not a computer program.
To try and cheat and hack at bitcoin is pretty close to impossible. (Quantum computing not withstanding.) 
I highly suggest [watching this video]( to give you some idea as to the probability of hacking bitcoin.
And if my dumb interpretation of bitcoin can be made more sophisticated, please correct me. I'm NOT anywhere near an expert.
EDIT The video I linked to actually explains cryptocurrencies. 
[This is the video by the same person]( that explains the crazy absurdly astronomically impossible situation of hacking a 256 bit security.
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:39:45
The precedent with stocks though doesn't favor this approach.
According to the current rules they can't tax me on "Company X" stock I bought at 12$ then, that is worth 350$ now. 
Yes its appreciated, but I haven't accessed that appreciation yet, nor have I traded the stocks for something of another value. 
Your analogy doesn't ring true.
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:56:50


Absolutely not. 
Or may be a starting point, but imo you should have researched wallets before buying. 
Either way, you should be keeping your crypto in a hard wallet at home. Something like a Trezor or Ledger. 
It is not wise to keep your crypto with a third party imo.
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:50:06
I saw that, thank you!

I was fortunate. My FIL was a jeweler. Now retired.
Gold was cheaper at the time and he kept insisting I buy. So I did.
I should have held on to it but it came time to buy a house and I needed money for the down payment. It had appreciated quite a bit, so it definitely helped. But I wish I held on to it.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:06:04
It's the EtchASketch that cinched it for me.
Can't argue with that.

When it's such a sudden shoot up like this, is that a whale move?
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:55:16
That is very likely possible. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:49:28
You know of any way I can contact wf and get them to actually reflect that reality?
Is it a wf issue or cb issue?
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:40:08

Coinbase for me, in the US, is unfortunately still the cheapest option :(

If it goes the way you've described, it's foolproof!
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:47:23
Look at how much BTC you received with the 102$ purchase.
Now look in your wallet. You'll notice it's still that same amount of BTC (perhaps minus the  small transaction fee).
The price of BTC may fluctuate but the amount of BTC you hold doesn't change.

A good read considering impeachment hearings are inevitable.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:30:16
Just for my clarification, are digital wallets like Trezor or Ledger considered 3rd parties?
In my comment I was referring to organizations like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, etc.
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:08:31
Cool! Thanks
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:36:06
I think I understand your point.
Your comment is not making it clear though to less experienced users the dangers of leaving your coins in a corporation's care versus having your coins' information on a USB stick you purchased.
So while you may be technically correct, your comment is misleading.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:14:55
The irony in your analogy, when viewed from their perspective, is palpable.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:13:41
Make sure you actually hold the keys yourself and have not stored the coin(s) with a 3rd party!
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:33:20
Shhhhh! If you ignore it, it'll keep going up.....

Oh right. Like that's gonna work. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:15:47
Thank you!
Was this at the end of your meal or before? 
I'm very curious. Thank you for taking the time to respond. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:30:49
That's your prerogative.
Based on that, no amount of what anyone says here will change your mind. 
You've already made it. Too suspicious. 
No worries. No hard feelings. All good. Enjoy 2019! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:08:11
Can you detail the process? Was it as simple as "here's the address, send your BTC here"? 
Did you identify that you were paying in BTC ahead of time? Did they make you pay at the time of ordering? Was the transfer confirmed officially before you left? 
Did they give the price in € and in BTC? Did they have a live conversion/exchange price? Daily set price exchange? 
 
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:17:07
That's *not* the way you're supposed to be using it?
@_date: 2018-07-01 14:22:40
I'm sorry, all I can think of is Homer going to clown college - *It's the double spin fantastique!* (I'm paraphrasing.)
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:41:45
So I initiated the transfer as it was dipping and I was like, This is the perfect way for me to "make it" bounce back up...
Sure enough, by the time my money gets into my account it's back up above 10,5K
Oh well.
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:51:51
Actually, you gave me an idea....
Instead of transferring a large amount when it's dipping, I'm going to set up a small recurring deposit!
Thanks :)

Selling? Who's selling? HODL!!!
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:56:41
What's your point?
Bitcoin is dead? 
Fiat is king? 
We're wasting our time and money? 
What are you accomplishing here besides disparaging bitcoin on a bitcoin sub. 
I personally like hearing naysayers. It keeps me grounded. 
But in terms of what your motivations are, I'm curious.
It takes a lot of empathy and thick skin to keep coming here and telling bitcoin hodlers that bitcoin is useless and doomed. 
So I'm asking you, **What's your point?**
@_date: 2019-09-16 10:35:32
That's not enough of a reason.
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:41:48
They only lost if they sodled. 
Not if they hodled. 
@_date: 2019-09-15 15:07:50
I have the Ledger nano S and CAN'T STAND the way it constantly scrolls the verification code making it almost impossible to verify.
My Trezor used to do it  too but they updated the code and now it displays a static alpha numeric for easy verification.
Hopefully ledger fixes this as well.
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:26:29
Nice!
