I'm exploring the possibility of doing this. I suppose right now, best thing to do is to gauge interest so all questions and criticisms are welcome. 
Hurdlr is certainly an app that could be customized to perform those functions.

Nice. I like this bit of advice. I haven't thought about it from a timing perspective. 
I don't believe anyone is focusing on building an app that can do all of this but truth it, we all need it. Especially if we want to see wider adoption. 
This is going to be a weekend project for me so hopefully I can roll out an MVP soon. Any advice and feedback is appreciated.

close but not this. I'd prefer to keep the document offline in an excel sheet vs. cryptofolio

I'd imagine because your paper wallet code is your Private Key, unless someone were to take it or the QR code physically, there is no way to steal your BTC from your blockchain wallet because it isn't signed. 
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong

THIS. I have been looking for a good excuse to buy a Rasberry Pi.

Can you please elaborate on what exactly happened? What type of security were you using to protect your wallet? 
Two-factor auth on MtGox?
Paper wallet?

Very awesome. Thanks @_date: 2013-10-27 05:46:58
I like it and I think if you allowed export to CSV, it would be a major selling point for me to use it. I clear out history on my browser after every useage.
I wish I had the time to help you on this project. Front end guy here. HTML,CSS,JQuery and junior PHP + RoR skills. Still learning heavily and I come from a startup biz dev background.
I think the most useful feature for anyone using it immediately would be to be able to export csv. 
After that I would maybe allow user accounts. Allow input but only save data if you create an account.

That fucking clown.

If no one responds, we can all collaborate on building one via google docs. Let me know if you're interested.

Phil what additional measures do you take personally beyond paper wallet?

I'm just thinking of a simple excel sheet that would display my purchases, arbitage if I do move them across different exchanges and then finally cash out.
This document would need to calculate my fees associated with any movement in coin as well. Purchasing costs a fee and buying/selling and then finally outgoing to bank has a fee associated with it too. Right now I'm assuming everyone sends out via Coinbase or sells locally but in the future when other exchanges allow conversion to fiat currency, we'll need to take that in to account.

They couldnt have keylogged your password, if two factor auth was on so I'd imagine it got phished. If you dont mind, forward me the email. I'd love to take a look at it to see if I can identify anything of use. Sgh20036
Ill just use one of my testing laptops to check this out.
It seems like they would have had to hijack your existing session and you would have had to have been logged in.
