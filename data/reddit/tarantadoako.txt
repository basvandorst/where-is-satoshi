My transaction has been uncofirmed for 2 days. What should I do?. Cancel and resend?.

So if BTC keeps growing. Lets say the market cap tripled in 2018. How would the transaction fees look like?.

If it still stays the same. How high?.

I am sweating. Is there a chance that the sender scammed me?.

Is there a difference in computing power between a $1000 and a $10 transaction?.

Is there something going on with bitcoin right now?. My transaction has been unconfirmed for 3 days. Longest I have ever waited. It usually took 1-2 hours before.

So this is why people hate Roger Ver. Jesus, what an ahole.

Is there something going on in the past 3 days?. My transaction is still unconfirmed. Longest I waited for was 2 hours.

What I did was buy ETH with BTC and withdraw that. I think the fee was about $2.50. I dont know about the other alt coin. Maybe it will be cheaper. Anyone know how much the fees for the other coins?. I wouldnt withdraw BTC out of coinsquare. I dont think their business model is meant to do that.

It still ends up on centralized exchanges. Not ur key not ur bitcoin.

Coinsquare is definitely not for beginners and their btc  withdrawal fee is insane but I use it because of their flexepin option. Site is glitchy and very confusing. I have been using quad more now that they have flexepin.

Hi trevon

Hasty market. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:53:37
But u still have centralized exchanges. Alot of the bitcoin this guy unloads will end up on these exchanges.
