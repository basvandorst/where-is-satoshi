I feel bad for all the people next run that buy bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin just like all the fools that made ethereum classic go to 25 bucks this time around.

So they can rebuy in.
The idea behind this is they have to pay a lot of people back in btc.
So if it's sitting still 6k and you liquidate and rebuy at 4k you are making money quick and easy.
So idealy if you follow this wallet and watch then dump coins you should be able to spot a nice dip about to happen to buy... Is what's speculated

Maybe the cashier lied about the hundreds but that's amazing that he has said this before! Where did he say that? I'd love to show one of my friends who's been calling my bs on this for a few years.

Eh. There's ways around it. I did high-end investments for 10 years some were kinda scamy but it's very very easy to allow non accredited investors in. All you needed was the right paperwork saying they understood the risks. All would be filed with the sec with form d and I operated under bluesky laws hidden behind  a loophole that I was the officer of the company. So I had no training at all really besides how to sell my ass off.

True store Steve woz buys hundreds by the sheet and has it perforated and keeps it in a book. I've personally seen him open it rip out a hundred to pay for clothing. Thought it was a check but when I went to pay the cashier told me it was actually a bunch of sheets of 100s

Or even inside the US it's not available in all states I read.

Also not true. With some of the startups I was a fundraiser for we didn't give a shit if you had 10 dollars or 10 thousand dollars. All that mattered was you understand that sending 10 dollars is not really going to do jack shit for you.

That's awesome haha thank you!

I like the idea that it's not one person but a group of people.
