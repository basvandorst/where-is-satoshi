are you sure that Putin has denied? do you know what Russian Prime Minister said about Crypto currency? He said Do not bury crypto instead you should support it.

I don’t know what you are trying to prove in here, But Simpsons did predict it will happen.  We all think what if we get this and what if we get that, but telling that it will happen is  definitely a great skill to have. My point is in here that whatever simpsons predicted did happen which is amazing. I don’t have time to argue with kids who are trying to boost their low self esteem by trying to prove that they are clever and their arguments are best.

No one knows about that but sure i could last forever like a Gold. However being to scared or being to greedy can make you lose money so chose your goal take your profit and be happy as an example if the price reaches to $40000 then sell it take your profit and be happy and don’t regret if it goes to 100000 however if you are afford to lose money then take a risk and wait till it get to 1 million

Thanks for the comment. I researched about demand of Bitcoin which shows price could reach all time high this year and  price can start to increase after 26 January 2019, However please do your own research. A survey showed only 40% of Chinese wants to invest in Bitcoin. The Demand has increased significantly around the world.

Yearly Low history still shows Bitcoin price has increased every year. If you would have bought it in 2017 and sell it now with low price still shows you making 5 times more profit. Bitcoin price has steadily increased in last 10 years. It has been crashed  about 9 times and after every crash the price has doubled then previous highest. There was a bigger crash before then Now, which was 89%, The crash has never effected a long term investor.  [Bitcoin Crash History ](
