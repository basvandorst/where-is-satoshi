Or it might just stay a means of exchange and not a store of value.

No, I know what HTML or the different programming paradigms are (and looking at you answers, better than you)
Anyway, do you mean html as a container for javascript? because, wow, there goes functional progamming or security. Do you mean the browser as a sandbox?
Mentioning HTML does not make sense or at least you answer did not help.
The functional thing you are talking about... You have not even tried to explain the advantage it would have or how you would implement it. Seeing how everything is distributed and and based on manipulation of state in transactions, all it would add would be syntax since everything would be wrapped in artifacts to contain sideeffects.
I also kown what turing complete is, and you would probably understand you can implement functional programming on top of a turing complete machine or why turing completeness might be a good thing for future expansion or grow path
Anyway, go back to the other ancap teenagers and go pretend over there you know what you are talking about unless you can give me an actual motivation for your remarks.


This is you speaking, functional languages have been around for ages and people know how they work. It's just now that it seems to grow in popularity and attract and as usual some rockstar* coders need to start giving their opinions on it.

are you just using words? As in, ordering them and pretending that you actually know what you are talking about?
Html or functional inspired. Turing complete. It doesn't even make sense, please clarify what you even mean in this context. 
Also, tell me how ideas feel, because that touchy-feely thing when over my head.
I'm not saying the implementation is perfect, but as far as revolutionary is, I do believe it deserves the moniker "(bitcoin/blockchain) 2.0"

Because the other option would be your knowledgeability. Which you just proved is not on par.

That the cost of not having to be surrounded by god damn illiterate.

Yep, but it's easier to scream "They took ur muney".
But I believe you are correct ... the alternative is lose everything when the bank goes down.
We also don't know if he is from cyprus or just using the isle to avoid taxes.

Isn't the alternative that laika bank goes out of bussiness and you lose everything except the state garanteerd deposit?

You pay apple for an 'IOU' that you can exchange for products in their store. The difference between itunes credits and ripple is lightyears.

now do the premined coin thing....
