Hi all, I am from Marawi City of the Philippines. I currently live in Manila but I was born and raised in Marawi City. I would suggest everyone to donate any amount to Marawi City. Why?
1. Around 6 months ago, a militant group who supports ISIS (Terrorist group) started a war in our city which lasted for 5 months.
2. Around 600,000 people was displaced due to the siege.
3. Death toll reached a thousand
4. Majority of the people in Marawi is poor
5. Due to the siege, people who depends on their small businesses stopped operation so they don't have an income for half a year now.
I believe in cryptocurrency and spread awareness in a small community and I believe we can help my people who are affected in the Marawi Siege.
There are orgs who raised fund raisers to help Marawi but cryptocurrency in the Philippines is just starting so no org is accepting BTC currently (or at least I know of).
I currently work for the Gov't of the Philippines so I have connections who I can trust the donated money/BTC to help Marawi City. If you guys are interested I will manage the BTC and donate it to proper organization.
This is my facebook account:  if you want to verify me.

If you know a non profit org who accepts BTC for Marawi City please let us know so we could direct it to them.
