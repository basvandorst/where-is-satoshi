yes and no. In theory the more bitcoin is in use and businesses accept it the higher the price will rise. However, the way most businesses currently go about accepting bitcoin is that they accept it using bitpay and immediately sell the coins for fiat which negatively impacts price. If we could get companies to start accepting and keeping their BTC then the prise would rise.

what even is this thing? I mean I know it says "magical device that revolutionizes bitcoin storage" but I'm gonna need more than that. I mean I am fairly new to cryptos and that sounds like bullshit advertising for what is essentially a hard drive (or ssd maybe), maybe you could help explain it a bit better to me? because if it is genuinely a worthwhile product it is good to know about

no no no, you are being too logical, see. you have to blindly parrot all the good things about bitcoin and ignore the things that can be improved in hopes that they will just magically resolve themselves... I mean it's not like NASA ever improved on their shuttles, or car manufacturers have ever revised a car to make it safer and faster, that would just be ridiculous.

well to be fair the whole microsoft thing was kind of massive news

to (attempt to) answer your question, I am not really sure. you could try starting a business that accepts bitcoins and holds them, not a full one but an online store of sorts. If you have any sort of skill or service that can be used online that people would be willing to pay for it might be your best bet.
Now for why i really came  here, I had been using BTC jam, I had some issues with scammers that kinda disheartened me... Obviously you are having a better experience (right?) have the scammers decreased or are you just good at finding them?

thanks, that makes a lot more sense

yeah there are plenty of good sites you can buy from, maybe try coin.mx if you must. i hear it's reputable but I haven't ever used it myself.

well I don't know what to say, $35 bucks is way too much to loan to someone I don't know.
