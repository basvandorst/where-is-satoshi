That's just indigestion.

Be great if this became a thing all over Europe. I regularly change Sterling into Euros and it'd be great if I could just cash out some Bitcoin at the destination

Yep. I have an account with a First Direct and it works great
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:39:43
I had that the first couple of times I tried it for First Direct but they (First Direct) had recently changed their BIC codes. I tried it again about a week later and it worked fine
Best of luck with all this!

Coinbase does let you. I’m in the U.K. &amp; have used it to sell BTC recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:25:11
Log in and go to Settings -&gt; Linked Accounts and click on Link New Account. In the pop-up window I selected Bank Account. In the next window, enter the following information:  
Bank Name -&gt; I put in First Direct PLC  
IBAN -&gt; Entered the IBAN number that FD gave me  
BIC Code -&gt; Entered the relevant BIC Code for the account  
Once you do this, they will ask you to do a small (&gt;6Euro) transfer to their account in Europe and will show you the bank details of where to send it to. Obviously, you'll need to do this in tandem with your bank. Once that's done (and the correct ref details included), then Coinbase will validate it. Then, you can then sell BitCoin and have the money transferred directly into you GBP bank account
Hope this helps

MPesa has utterly transformed access to finance in East Africa and bitcoin is just going to ride that wave right across the continent when it takes off

[This episode of This American Life]( is a great insight into "regulatory capture", and how banks are able to control the very people who are supposed to be monitoring them

I'm with you. I fly with them a lot with my young boys and have never had problems.

This has nothing to do with the BTC crypto-currency as such, rather the power of the underlying blockchain methodology that allows bitcoin to function in a reliable and trusted fashion

I just type BTCUSD into the search bar. Is this new?

If I was running Western Union I would be terrified of Bitcoin as well. It completely destroys their business model

Where would you recommend to trade in the UK?

No he's not. He's packed his cabinet and government position with family members, generals and Wall St bankers. The establishment are loving this

As a European who's absolutely been terrified by Trump's commitment to withdrawing from NATO, I guess 0.01 BTC might come in handy for my new life under our Russian overlords

Who the fuck knows?  I think he just panders to whoever is in front of him &amp; says what they want to hear. 
I don't get the Republican Party. They could have shaved a chimp &amp; put it in a suit &amp; it would've beaten Hilary. Yet, they managed to find possibly the most odious man in America &amp; chose him as a candidate. So, America, your choice - Total Douche or Turd Sandwich (thanks South Park)

The way he says “hope we’re doing the right thing” suggest he’s concerned about losing his investment. At his age and clear risk-averse profile, is this really the right thing for him to be doing?

$18- for a mug? With tax &amp; shipping, what’s that, like $23?  
I don’t mind buying a mug - just don’t like feeling like one when I do. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:46:19
Agreed. Who thinks “I have $10k to send back to India. I know - I’ll use this illegal method to send it”

An Exchange Traded Fund. Allows you to buy and sell shares in a basket of products (like shares of other companies or Bitcoin). They are known for having low management overheads so very low costs. The [SPY]( ETF, for example, has an expense  ratio of 0.09%

That may be true but it's not the point. They are the people who decide what is and isn't considered a safe haven
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:06:49
That’s roughly £0.60/apple. I don’t know where you’re buying your apples from now compared to a few years ago, but you’re paying over twice as much as I would pay in London which is one of the most expensive cities in the world (apples are £0.25 each in a pack of 6)
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:11:13
Bitcoin is a “safe haven”? I’m all for bitcoin but there aren’t many people in the world of finance who would subscribe to that view

How did you sell the bitcoin? Was it on an exchange or through something like localbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:25:43
So if the guy had bought a car instead and drove off in it, would they demand that the car dealership return the money? I doubt it somehow
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:15:20
So what Bitcoin related companies can us small people invest in?
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:39:41
How can you say it makes zero sense when I give you a reason how it does make sense for some people? You may not agree but I'd rather deal with a buyer with good feedback and have the money transferred over than meeting some nobody in the local Starbucks trying to give me counterfeit notes.
Downvote away as it seems that's how people deal with contrary opinions in this subreddit

Aside from the fact that the rates for cash are much worse, that obviously brings a whole raft of problems in itself
