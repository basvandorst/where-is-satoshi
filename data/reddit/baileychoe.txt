You’re not calculating what’s more important which is the percentage of the up days vs the down days. You could have 360 up days of less than 1% and one down day of 30%.

No man. You’re just numb from the volatile price swings. It’s called motion sickness

A simple no would have been fine.

Do you believe bitcoin will become as more of a commodity like for instance digital gold rather than currency in the future?

Of course you’re going to rely on your parents if shit hits the fan. Typical millennial. How about leave your parents out of it and take responsibility for your action. That way you will actually make a grown ass man decision.

I’ll tell you what’s really going to happen. You’re going to get your 1 btc before it hits $100k. And you’re going to stick to your brilliant plan and sell. Thinking you’re a genius now but  Bitcoin doesn’t drop back down but instead go straight up to $300k. Maybe to a million. Now you’re kicking yourself in the ass for being a idiot. While others who just held is living out your brilliant early retirement dream. 
Or or or since everyone in the world thinks it’ll automatically go up due to halving the whales will do the opposite and drop it like a rock back down to $10k. Now you just lost 50% of your investment and officially became a bag holder. Just holding on to that dream of yours. One day just one day I’ll retire early.

I screen shot this. You better own it when it hits $16k or you’re a bitch

It’s a good deal to people that has high income that’s looking for annual deductions to minimize their taxes. It’s ok to be debt as long as you know how to manage it and still save.

Not to be a racist but we all know a Asian will never be at the “White House”. Unless.... they rename it a the yellow house.

What goes up that fast and that much drops the same or even more. You want nice steady uptrend with consolidation. It wouldn’t surprise me if bitcoin drops fast between $6k to $7k to kill all stop loss and rise back up to kill the shorts. Happens more than you think.

Jesus are we really that stupid to talk about bitcoin being $100k or $1m. Let’s first get pass $10k.
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:00:01
It’s called consolidation.
