Spread the word, we can kill Bcrash by relegating it to being a token layer as an interim solution until LN.

BTC will have an tokenized equivalent on the BCH chain, which is where the off-chain transactions will occur. The tokens act as a decentralized accounting system that updates the BTC allocations. A user can then sign on both chains to to release their BTC and return their BCH tokens back to the pool.

Users can run their own or point to someone elses, it's immaterial who actually run the nodes.

It'd be transparent to you as a user...
If you're sending the BTC to another BCH token address, tokens on the BCH side move there. If you're sending to a native BTC address, your BTC leaves the middle layer wallet and the associated BCH tokens are released back to the pool.

The fact that it is itself a blockchain which will work with mirrored signatures and addresses makes it an ideal candidate for a payment layer without actual needing a meaningful supply of tokens on that doomed-to-fail chain.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about re: gold. Gold can't be sent through the intertubes and isn't secured by the most powerful network in the world.
Blockstream has 2 devs out of hundreds working on Core, not sure what centralization you're talking about. Go to your pathetic inactive dev mailing list for BCH if you're so concerned.

I'm an IT professional but not a coder which is why this needs viral support. I've thought this concept through and feel it can work every bit as good as lighting while destroying the value of BCH. 
What makes it inferior to lighting is use of the BCH chain which will eventually become worthless, hense it would be a project for an **optional** and temporary payment layer. 
No BTC need ever be risked as it doesn't require the BCH chain in order to leave the multisig core wallet. It is completely decentralized, the middleware is effectively a client node.

the middleware node performs that logic based on the signed transactions coming from the user wallet. Whether that node is independent or the user themselves doesn't matter because it's all signature based.
The benefit is using the faster transactions without currency risk and without centralized exchanges.
It's effectively LN with some tradeoffs.

BTC is the value being exchanged. It's value is derived from it's decentralized and secure network.
The BCash chain can be a second layer that BTC uses, much as fiat uses visa and paypal... and without having to hold any meaningful amount of BCH. 
Just as Visa doesn't make you convert fiat bucks to visa bucks, neither should using bigger blocks require an inferior token.

no one "owns" it perse, but depositors of BCH to the multi-sig wallet would receive reimbursement on the BTC side in the form of fees.
So there would be an incentive to provide liquidity, but only a little is required since tokens only need mere satoshis.

It would be completely decentralized. All the data is retained on the two respective blockchains... the middleware node is effectively just a client.

The blockchains. 
The middle layer is trustless, as the wallet on either chain is multisig and thus can only move coins/tokens in a manner instructed by the user wallet.
When a move is made, it's broadcasted to the blockchains rather than updated internally. Traditional double-spend philosophy then applies.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:30:30
it could be integrated into an existing wallet, but that would be more like running a full wallet than an SPV wallet.
Existing wallet software would only need a small add to communicate with this layer, rather than the full logic engine. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:00:49
It wouldn't need to communicate directly with the BCH chain, it could simply sign the transaction which is then spent on both chains by the middle layer.

If he falls through let me know, I'd be happy to do this for my local shelter. 
If there's one local to you that you really would prefer to help, I donate goods to mine on occasion.. they always need food/cat litter and you may be able to drop ship that with BTC from some etailer.

If you can't articulate your issue with this, then I assume you don't.

That's like saying colleges don't teach anything because the people that go to them want the education.
Fiat punishes saving, Bitcoin rewards it. This necessarily re-trains Bitcoin users saving/spending practices.
