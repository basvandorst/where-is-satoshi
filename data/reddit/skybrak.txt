Thanks, this is really interesting! I think I need to learn more about bitcoin scripting. 
However, I am now starting to think my initial thoughts are impossible to achieve. See [my other reply].(

This kind of services is what I had in mind for the last part, to detect that an address has been touched. It is great that there are several so we don't have a single-point-of-failure. 
However, when the address is touched (emptied, even!), it is already too late. I would want to be alerted when this step happens but the person who made the transaction should not get all my bitcoins in this step. 
Ideally, the transaction would unlock some new secret which would be the next breadcrumb in the treasure hunt. But, as I said, I'm not too hopeful...

Thanks, the vault idea is interesting. Seems like it is still only an idea, though.

Thanks for commenting, nice to hear that someone else has thought about this. 
I am starting to come to the same conclusion, that what I want to achieve is not possible. 
The main reason being that whatever (if anything) can be revealed by an on-chain transaction can also be revealed by a local calculation, without doing something detectable on the blockchain.  
A private deathswitch is always possible but it would be really great to have a decentralized/public mechanism, independent of any private servers being online (except for the monitoring/detection part)

Yes, I am well aware of that :)
I may have failed at explaining the givens. The scenario here was the private key is privately given to someone I trust. In case the private key was leaked, stolen or prematurely used, I want to detect that so I can take steps.

Good point. 
However one possible application for this would be for a "death switch": If I'm still alive and see that the secret has been released I can take steps to stop the process. If I'm dead I would like the process to continue so my family can use the secret for the next step of the treasure hunt :)

Interesting angle. I don't think I understand fully though. For starters the precondition: 




What exactly do you mean by this statement? I think this is the crucial part. 
Also, would your suggestion be doable today? Or are protocol changes needed?

Thanks for commenting, not sure I understand your question though. 
In this scenario, I would want the secret to be good. I want the transaction to go through, but I also want something to happen on the public bitcoin blockchain, so I can detect it and take steps (if necessary)
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:44:24
Thanks. I would really like to stay with the bitcoin blockchain if possible.

The secret could be any random string, and it doesn't matter if it is revealed publicly, because the general public wouldn't know what to do with it. As I described in another reply, the secret could be used as one "breadcrumb" in a larger treasure hunt. 
The important part is that the discovery is detectable (by me), but the public key could be calculated off-chain.
