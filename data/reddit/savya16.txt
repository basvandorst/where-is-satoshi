I am Indian and this post is BS. Thanks for contributing to the FUD. I will buy your cheap BTC.

It's not even up yet. Beware. Does not look that legit.

Personally i haven't made a card transaction yet as I'm yet to be verified lol. But I have heard from a lot of people that you need to try different combinations in the "Name " field while entering card details. Ensure it matches your Bitstamp name, name on credit card etc. Worked differently for different people. Just check it out and let us know if you have any luck.

Exactly, media being the media. I for one am happy the media is doing that. It flushes out the weak hand and people who don't really believe in the technology behind Bitcoin, and in it only for the short gains.
Gives veterans an opportunity to accumulate more, when prices drop due to FUD.

No bank has outright blocked any exchange in India. But they have bottle-necked the fund transfer to and from the exchange accounts to user accounts. Specifically, they've stopped all automated withdrawals from, and deposits to exchanges. This means that each deposit or withdrawal needs to be checked by eye, by the exchange employees. This means that deposits and withdrawals take upto 5 days to show up for any user.
The bigger exchanges such as Zebpay and Koinex have confirmed that this is a temporary measure, and that they have been working with their banking partners to re-enable automated withdrawals and deposits ASAP.

Yes. That's one stage where anonymity is actually lost.
But I'd like to point out that if both buyer and seller are participating in exchange of Bitcoin, it wouldn't make much sense for buyer or seller to disclose trade information with anyone else.
In my book, this is 100x more acceptable when compared to exchanges like coinbase, who need you to submit all legal documents and bank details to verify your identity and what not, just to get a foot in the door to cryptocurrency trading.

That was the most annoying part of the whole ordeal. I am an OSX user, but had trouble there nonetheless.
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:05:03
That's exactly why I did it. Here's what all I learnt:
1. Setting up a Bitcoin node
2. Setting up a lightning node
3. Linux Command line
4. Various Bitcoin and lightning apis
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:44:04
Just connected.
Now what haha. Still figuring out all the options lightning has.

I got a 512 gb MacBook pro and I still have around 200gb left to spare, with the whole blockchain and my other files. I plan to delete the blockchain files and Bitcoin qt now though, as it's already sitting on the hard drive connected to the pi.

Aren't you the same guy who was complaining about getting down voted whenever you spoke about mining being profitable? I had forgotten about you. but I thought before too, about why aren't these things discussed more openly in this subreddit 
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:48:25
New study? Puh lease. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:06:30
You are absolutely right. I have never done money transfers in the US. Most of it has been Venmo.
As you suggested, I went to the Wire Transfer section of Chase instead of the Bank Transfer section, and I was able to add recipient without issues. Thank you so much for clarifying this for me!
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:26:07
didn't work. gimme it. pls
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:01:07
Another question I have is, do wire transfers always cost a minimum of $25? That's alot of cash lost when investing small amounts of money

What if you already are a sexual tyrannosaurus
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:38:05
Have you used it before? Could you explain more on their pricing model?
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:28:34
If you're already in a trade, the prices are locked in until the trade finishes. You can cancel the trade but you lose the same maker fee if you do so.

You really need to brush up on what Decentralization is buddy.
" If you can download it, it's centralized."? Really? Please explain how it is so.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:06:28
Agreed. My fiat volumes are quite low too so I am completely fine with the low volumes on Bisq. Although, there are times I have seen some high volume trades happening on Bisq.

Is there any special steps I'd need to follow to update from 0.16.3 to 0.17.0.1?
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:01:55
I have already followed the guide to set up and run 0.16.3. I'm currently running it. I needed to know how to upgrade it to 0.17.0.1 without hassle. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:57:53
Hehehe. Indian Railways. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:29:10
You have my up vote. This needs to be on top.

Indian here:
Honestly, Yes Bank doesnt even come close to being India's biggest bank.
But well said either way.
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:53:57
Tl;dr invest in coins based on fundamentals, not based on marketcap or price 
@_date: 2018-07-04 03:41:29
We Indians care :(
Jk. All Indian exchanges are pivoting to offer peer to peer exchange services just like LocalBitcoins. We're not going anywhere.
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:52:15
Binance has zero trading fee at the moment. Unsure about the other 2 exchanges mentioned. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:52:35
Living up to the name 
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:13:48
Exodus wallet is a good option. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:03:15
Oh. Well that makes sense too. But lets not be vindictive like bitmain, and be less disruptive like our Core team! 
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:13:18
They handle the second largest volumes of Bitcoins in India. Plus, I've interacted with their customer care a few months ago when my transaction was stuck. And they sorted out the issue immediately. This makes me have a little faith in them. But don't take my word for it. Let's wait and watch. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:14:14
They did make an announcement saying they're migrating their servers. And should be back soon. Don't know whether to trust them though.
