observable as in verifiable fact? do you have some proof to back any of those accusations up? pretty heavy accusations your dishing out.

hmmm...big sellers will sometimes stagger amounts at the same price level or stagger quantities at spread out prices. impossible to say. if it keeps getting added to at the same price my guess would be a single seller mostly.

lol...sorry mate I'm usually a sucker for a good conspiracy theory but that just sounds a trifle retarded...kind of reminds me of the saying that the rich powerful elite secretly running the world are actually lizard people. lol...never a dull moment here on reddit.

I was just thinking the same thing. the amount of energy it must take to mine a bitcoin might meet or exceed that of a similar value of gold. be interesting to see the actual comparison one day.

i used to use armory, my god what an unpleasant experience it was. i commend the devs for trying to offer a first rate form of storage but what a broken mess it was. one of the happiest days of my bitcoin experience was when i finally deleted it. ok sorry for the rant...lots of pent up frustration regarding armory and me. 
to use armory (at least when i used it) you had to have an online version and an offline version (for maximum storage security). the online version required downloading the ENTIRE blockchain in order to verify transactions and to spend coin from an offline wallet. 
sorry i cant get any more technical that that as i gave it up a couple of years ago and don't remember the details.

yes sorry could be that also. hard to say,  don't trade GDAX so didn't see the outcome of the ask. I don't know the mechanics of GDAX order book. is it total # of asks at that price or a single ask? if it gets filled fully or even mostly then definitely not spoofing. bid/ask walls get partial fills (small) but are usually pulled very quickly once they start getting filled.

I would rephrase that personally by saying "they share very different viewpoints about what Bitcoin should be" 
to me it seems the Bitcoin core crowd is happy with the way things are and the way they are going and are hostile to anything that changes this...
the Bitcoin cash crowd is unhappy with the way things are mainly I believe because, they see the current changes as an attack on what bitcoin was, a decentralized currency created specifically to avoid central, corporate control and see the current path of bitcoin headed in this direction via Segwit.
the alternative to supporting this perversion to them is to back bitcoin cash. my opinion anyways...

watch from 6:10 i give him a lot of respect for that little tidbit. i think he's the genuine thing...only time will tell i suppose.
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:14:29
cool thanks for reply. i can respect that. That's what i thought might be happening. think I'm going to buy a little bit more of it. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:06:53
ouch! such nastiness...bi-polar?  /mommy voice on "did you lose some bitcoin today? " /mommy voice off
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:11:47
well i guess time will tell but its been pretty easy to wash coins for the past three or so years. its not like he has 20 million coins and he cant wash em all and needs an alternative. just doesn't add up. sorry mate i think your getting to involved in your conspiracy theory and forgetting the possibility that maybe he wants a free bitcoin un-privatized and corrupted by inept custodians. sorry gotta get up early...been fun. gnight

@_date: 2017-08-11 05:02:58
has it become more profitable to leave this chain already? sorry I'm not an expert at mining...serious question. why are they leaving to mine other chain?
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:54:51
beer and a bitcoin atm. what else do you need in this heat?
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:59:36
that's what I just thought as well. poor s.o.b. I think he was a gonner even before bull put his horn through his spine. survival of the fittest I guess? guess the bull was smarter...
