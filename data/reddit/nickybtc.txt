Can you show us your hardware wallet? Or just trolling?

Took 1 day for me.

You can use that Bitcoin after you bought it. Try to send it to an address you own and find out. From my experience you can move that Bitcoin after you bought it. Cheers

Lol :)) this will never work for your average Joe. Check this website before sending your transaction. Also wait another 2 to 4 hours to get your transaction confirmed. What a joke

Have a node running home. Waiting for the rest of the network to Upgrade

If there is no Bitcoin Transaction when they pay for a taxi ride, how am i wrong? These guys are using Xapo. Not Bitcoin. Xapo may be a Bitcoin company, but there is no Bitcoin Transaction transmitted to the network. There is only a Xapo to Xapo transaction. Where is Bitcoin in this transaction. I don't see it. Please correct me if i did not understand this correctly.

How about you look at the price when the bug was discovered and when the bug was fixed with a HF. Haters gonna hate i guess
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:14:23
So they're not using Bitcoin. They're using Xapo.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:32:47
Guess we'll find out in the next couple of months, won't we?
@_date: 2016-07-28 05:40:51
FUD much?
@_date: 2016-07-15 08:30:12
But you're not the only one man &gt;:D&lt;

Comparing EmptyGOX to Coinbase is wrong and you know it.
