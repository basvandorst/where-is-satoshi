This is exactly the same.

And a different color.

If you can always print money then print now I guess.

Yes you can still use bitcoin even if your country doesn’t have the electricity just have an emergency power bank and it’s all good.

Congrats man! You can buy 2 brand new motorcycles here in our country if you have 1 btc.
@_date: 2019-03-21 03:29:37
Yes and it’s actually a good thing of promoting bitcoin to the public.

Funny thing is almost all of the early adopters forgot or sold their bitcoin for pizza and the likes.

Nike don’t care because imitation is the highest form of flattery for them.

This is likely to happen.

This is a very sad world we live in. Julian Assange is such a good man in terms of exposing all those government and other corporation secrets that they kept hidden from us because of so many reasons. Mark Zuckerberg on the other hand is still free and enjoying his life because he fund government by our personal data and information. I’m actually searching for a good crypto [casino]( game right now when I saw this post and really saddens me.

Oh man that’s too bad but thanks for the heads up. I’m only playing on America’s cardroom and [vegascasino]( because they have a good amount of players and they’re fair with the ones playing the game.

For once I don’t believe that satoshi is just a one person, I believe that satoshi is a big corporation that is running bitcoin from behind. Craig Wright is very wrong to claim that he is satoshi but I think he did it because no one is claiming that he/they are satoshi. I hope that the [exchange ]( Bittreo, will delist the coin of that man too.

Oh man we really hit 5k! I’m really confuse right now if I will but or not.

Yeah man MIUI is good and highly customizable too. I have a xiaomi phone too and I use it to trade and play some best online [games](

This is not new for me at least. Japan is the leading country in Asia in terms of technology and innovation, maybe South Korea is par with them now but still. I hope that more Asian countries will adopt so that it will make the cryptocurrency stronger in the east. I’m playing crypto [games]( here along with my dad who is on 60 plus age and he’s using crypto in his everyday life.
