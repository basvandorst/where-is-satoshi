So we agree then.

No doubt.  Red vs blue is an illusion.   They both want Bitcoin to fail.

Oh they care.    If they didn’t they would report the facts.   And they know most people only read the headlines.

I assure you the banking cartels are very afraid of this.   (But you are right.  Your analysis of me is actually correct. No sarcasm.).    Hodl!! Brother.

I know what it is...   what is the relevance?   
It says nothing about the false report.   Is it supposed to show me he is a good guy?    He probably is.   Like I said in the other comment.   His reporting wasn’t bad.   It’s the spin on the headline that is super messed up and manipulative.

I for real laughed out loud in public when I saw this.   Thank you.

What am I supposed to see here?

People are missing the point.   This isn’t about trump.   This isn’t for or against anyone.    This just shows that the “media”.   All of it.  Wants us to believe this is funny money.   (The noobs).     It just shows how important this is.    Giving the power back to us and away from them.    It’s that simple.   The US dollar is backed by the “Full faith and trust of the US government”.     What about the people?    What happens when the people don’t trust.    What if the people trust in the “Full faith and trust of the people”.     It’s all fiat.   But let us decide what fiat is important.      There are problems with it.  No doubt.  But that’s another convo.  And I’m probably already boring people.

I’m personally loving it.   Asian market sell off.   More for us.      Plus it seems like every time it does this it rallies even harder.   I’m certainly no expert but I have definitely seen this a few times.

Bitcoin plunges near 3-year low, stocks close slightly lower - Fox News
The actual report is much different.   That is some serious spin bullshit.
