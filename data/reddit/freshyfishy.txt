Yeah it's shit enough. Many were burned buying at Ath. They won't be back. 
Check out the Google trends. Nobody gives a toss about cryptocurrency at the moment.

Legendary as in shit and annoying?

Following on from the Op on the buy side if I trying to catch a fall if BTC is 9000 but I think it will drop to 8500. I want to purchase at 8500 so I set my stop at 8500 do I place my limit above the 8500? Example set limit at 8600 or do I set below 8500 at say 8400?
If the coin is dropping. My 8500 limit will activate but I can't get my head around which side of the price my limit should be. 
Thanks in advance

Never before has there been the tether scandal, multiple government talk about banning and regulation and such negative media attention. This is not the standard. We are in a nose dive

Here's a classic line given to potential stock investors which fits here: Past performance is not an indicator of future results.
