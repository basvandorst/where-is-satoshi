People raise a lot of good points here, but I think the one thing that *really* has the power to kill Bitcoin, other than the bad luck of the draw that would underlie the problems everyone is talking about here, is if some economists are right about a deflationary currency having disastrous consequences. I've heard some reasonably compelling arguments that that's total BS, but there are experts who believe it and it would really throw a monkey wrench into our works.

How is "hoarding" a problem?

[Open-Transactions]( It's what Bitcoin craves.
Honestly I think it's the most important possible software project for Bitcoin right now, and I'm going to be devoting as much time as I can to developing for it.
The biggest advantage in the short term though isn't the instant transactions or the scalability; it's allowing separation of currency issuers from exchanges, such that you don't actually have to trust your exchange -- you trust a currency issues of your choice, and then can use that with many different exchanges.

The point of offline storage is that the challenge for hackers becomes getting physical access to the keys, assuming the online storage is not terribly mismanaged.

People who have gold/silver already aren't exposed to the Rial's inflation, so trading that for BTC wouldn't do them much good.

I'm not sure about that. Don't most browsers render &lt;br&gt; as a newline? If you mean a newline in the raw HTML, I can't imagine a use case for that.

[Open-Transactions]( exchanges are the future; once OT is really production-ready, no one's going to want to use a centralized exchange.
As far as software for right now, I don't know much about that.
@_date: 2012-10-12 22:09:20
Yeah, counting on Time Machine for this is a bit like putting in a thumbtack with a chainsaw.
Cold storage is the solution. Just remember to save a new offline wallet every now and then; most clients pre-generate I believe 100 receiving addresses to store in the wallet, so if you have used all of those anything newer would be missing from the backup. Also, a paper wallet will keep longer than a USB stick for long-term storage (so long as the obvious sources of damage to paper are avoided).

But kWh aren't fungible... 1kWh can vary a lot in price from one place to another. They try to solve this by imposing a cap, but effectively the result is if you don't live somewhere where your power costs at least their cap, you're throwing away money by redeeming rather than selling to someone who can redeem for more... Therefore the value isn't related to the cost of energy, it's determined directly by the cap (less the inconvenience of selling it to someone in a place they'd want to redeem it).

What kind of project?
@_date: 2012-10-23 00:18:29
OT solves all the scalability issues; we'll have a federated system of OT servers that settle amongst eachother via Bitcoin. This will also make all transactions instant.
@_date: 2012-10-12 22:14:36
Yeah, this could be done entirely in the blockchain, eliminating risk to all parties; a website would be necessary just to host information about the projects. I think it's also possible to allow funders to vote to cancel the project and return all funds before the goal is reached.

This is a common economic misconception. You can't make money by investing in something, holding out, and using the value increase your investment has caused to cash out. It inherently costs you more value to bring the price down to its original level than you could gain by raising it.
If people are "hoarding" -- that is, buying a lot of BTC and not spending it, to use it as an investment, that's actually good for the Bitcoin economy. It supports the value of BTC, and the people who do it are essentially investing in Bitcoin's success.

The point of using a federated model along the lines of OT is to allow better separation of privileges, and more ability to choose who you trust; I can't imagine its adoption increasing fraud.
Payment processors, like Bitpay, would remain as useful as ever.

For someone whose firm is supposed to invest in BTC soon, he sure makes a lot of glaring errors that suggest he has absolutely no clue what Bitcoin is or how it works...
@_date: 2012-10-13 04:38:21
That makes sense, but to someone who isn't already that familiar with Bitcoin it could also sound like one of the more obvious fraud attempts. I agree with Thor here, that someone who's very familiar with what this sort of company would be worried about could make the case for Bitcoin better than anyone who may know *everything* about Bitcoin and why it makes sense for them, but we need an understanding of both sides to cross the gap.

I think our best bet for adoption in the short term (up til the point where network effects make it more broadly viable) is circumventing economically inefficient restrictions; e.g. Silk Road in economically stable countries and a relatively stable currency in countries like Argentina.

It's volatile because it has a monetary base of about $100M USD. Iran has a GDP of $990B USD. If one thousandth of Iran's GDP were held in BTC, the BTC economy would be about 10x as large.

Colored coins sound like a great idea, and I'll definitely be following that project too.
One thing about OT is that sooner or later we're going to *need* a federated system that offers instant transactions.
It also already implements secure federated markets, and it would be beautiful if we could start displacing centralized exchanges with it. It separates the issuer of an account for, say xUSD pegged to USD, from the exchange itself, so you are no longer trusting an exchange with your balance - you're trusting the xUSD issuer of your choice, which each exchange could support several of (and which would be usable across several exchanges).
It integrates well with Bitcoin, and it would integrate well with colored coins too. I'm picturing it acting as a layer on top of Bitcoin, allowing one wallet to contain, manipulate, and exchange between BTC, any colored BTC, OT native instruments, OT ripple... OT offers a lot of functionality that colored-coins are going to need (markets, software with an interface for issuing things, etc).
Are you still running a futures market BTW?

Not that kind of Bitcoin fork (I agree about those) -- this is a fork of existing software to add support for regular blockchain BTC as a currency.
