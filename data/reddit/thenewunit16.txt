Wait for a new bubble to peak and bust. That'll shut it up.

If you got thousands of dollars to drop on Dota2 items, you can absorb this loss as a life lesson.

As with any rule there are exceptions, ya know.

"Free" electricity. You could just hold your parent's bank balance hostage over the mining. "Pay me 20c per day or I'll use 4$ in electricity every day mining for that 20c"
But you're not even giving them that option.

Wild fluctuations for a currency that has been adopted by most people would mean the economy is fluctuating wildly. So, if the economy is stable, then the currency is stable. There will be no room for speculation like the market has now, in this ideal world where BTC is used as a currency by most people.

Really depends on your net worth.

Yeah no need for anything special here. Just generate an address for yourself but only give your employee the public address. They can have customers send coins to it, and you have the private keys to move the coin around. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:30:06
Well said. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:30:43
If most people used BTC as a currency, there wouldn't be any wild fluctuations.

Why people think it's perfectly safe to light a rock on fire to keep warm is beyond me.

Yeah I don't understand what it has to do with a bitcoin node either.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:26:22
Wow. Keep telling yourself that when its 75*F in the middle of December. Also, by "mainstream media" do you mean the vast majority of fucking scientists?

"Here's a 1TB Flash drive - totally bitcoin related cause the blockchain requires storage!"
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:37:01
What good is a bitcoin node on a portable laptop computer not connected to mains power, and which doesn't have enough storage to actually host the blockchain without storage attached via flimsy external cable?
If this is the device that enables you to run a full node, you must be really fuckin desperate to do so.

I have seen bitcoin rise to 30 and down to 5. Up to 150$ and down to 40. Up to 1200 and down to 120. There is a trend. You get the idea.

This is when the IRS asks how you managed to deposit +1,000,000$ over the span of x amount of years while making 45k at your job.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:23:11
You would have to make enormously more than 45k to justify 1m in positive deposits even over a ten year span. This like this the banks specifically trend for, and report directly to the IRS. It's called structuring.

No shit. Once it reached the amount where if I sell and paid my capital gains tax, that I wouldn't have to work any more, I'd hit that button. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:37:04
Bitcoin miners buying bitcoin to take control of bitcoin. Makes perfect sense?

QUE LAUGH TRACK
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:17:34
Bitcoin is basically a speculative market, so one could argue it's always in a bubble. I'm no expert though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:07
Welcome to the coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:20:59
If I could buy everything I want with bitcoin, I would have no incentive to convert to my countries currency. However that is not currently the case.

Not going to happen *any time soon*. When the 8th decimal point becomes too valuable, it will of course happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:33:04
That's the real joke. You expect it to be one thing and it turns out it's another. This is a common thing in comedy. Where you alter a punchline to catch someone, who thinks they know what happens next, off guard.

Interesting you have a specific email for reddit users requiring support. I can speculate on the many reasons as to why, but I wont. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:18:27
Yup. I'm sure thats the exact reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:12:34
Y tho? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:10:23
Double the blocks would typically mean double the hash power. This is likely just an anomaly though. Combination of luck and possibly some additional hashing power. Certainly not double though.

If you use Coinbase as your trading exchange I feel bad for you son. That's not their company model.
