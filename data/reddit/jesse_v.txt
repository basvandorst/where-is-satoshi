Yes, this is correct. Hidden service exist solely inside Tor and are not accessible from outside the network.

The authority nodes vote on the status of the network, and they can basically reject you if there's something seriously wrong with your node. This is what happened earlier with Heartbleed. Check out the fluctuations in the graphs around April: metrics.torproject.org

I operate two high-speed Tor exit nodes. Hundreds of terabytes of data have passed through my exits over the last six months, and I think I've received about a dozen complaints upstream to my ISP, maybe two or three of them were Botnet C&amp;C reports. That's very few. Based on these observations, and considering that my relays are picked randomly by Tor users, I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of Tor traffic is innocuous.
Botnet operators already have their own networks by which they can communicate with their machines, and some botnets can even form their own communication system.

Tor relay and exit node operator here.
Yes, relay nodes are generally really safe, and assuming your ISP is okay with them, there shouldn't be any problems. I've been able to set up exit nodes, and if you set things up right and follow Tor's recommendation to minimize problems, it should be smooth too. I've moved terabytes of data through my exits over the last six months, and I've had to deal with about a dozen email complaints that my ISP forwarded onto me. Compared to the amount of traffic that went through without complaint, that's hardly anything.

I live in the US, and my exits run in a university setting. 
Assuming your ISP's policies aren't against servers and Tor exits, I don't see why you should have a problem. [18 USC 2707]( explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000/account plus legal fees) in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause, and there are also [safe harbor provisions]( very similar to the ones that protect Internet backbone routers.

You're not the only introduction point. There are several of them, and they can change. The nodes are picked randomly, it's not like the operator decides to host as an introduction point.
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:27:51
I operate six Tor relays and two exits. In the US, Tor exit nodes are protected by US law, and basically fall under the same protection that backbone Internet routers enjoy. Tor exit node operators are not responsible for what comes out of the exit, and as long as they do not mix their own traffic with the exits, cannot be held liable.
Hundreds of terabytes of data have moved through my relays, and I've just had to deal with a dozen or so complaints via email. Not a big deal. It's unlikely that anything serious will happen to you.

Tor developers have to balance security against usability. So many websites use Javascript that permanently blocking it would prevent many sites from functioning at all. Tor devs try to maximize security while keeping reasonable levels of usability.
As another example, one vector of attack against Tor is a timing attack which is possible to perform by a large adversary who can monitor both ends of the three-relay circuit and can isolate communications. Rather than implement Tor relays so that they randomly slow or delay packets and disrupt this timing attack, the devs decided to not slow packets at all. This move made Tor more usable, allowing it to become popular. Now 2.4 million people use Tor and their communication is spread across 5,000 geo-diverse relays and 1,000 exits. An adversary can still try timing attacks, but now there's so much traffic that it's quite hard to isolate a specific circuit and carry out the attack.

Tor relay operator here.
The Tor Project recommends that exit node operators apply a restricted exit policy so that only certain ports can come out. At the minimum, 443 and 80, although of course you'd want to open up more to allow more services out. This really cuts down on torrent traffic, but also affects botnet C&amp;C too to some degree. Of course, if the botnet uses 80 and 443 for communication, then there's not a whole lot that can be done without the risks of false positives.
@_date: 2014-07-29 02:03:57
Yes, generally speaking. There are many Tor devs, and some specialize in some areas of Tor more than others. The community also submits patches and open bug and feature request tickets.

Tor relay operator here.
No, you misunderstand how this works. Tor exits are the last node in the three-relay hop for connections to the regular Internet. When you use Tor, your connection would look like this: computer =&gt; relay =&gt; middle =&gt; exit =&gt; google.com. The exit node does the DNS lookup on Google.com, but it has only been talking to the middle relay so it doesn't know where it came from. The middle relay just passes encrypted information and knows nothing. The entry relay guards your IP but can't see what you're browsing.
Hidden services are quite different, and the protocol is much more technical. With hidden services, both parties are anonymous, so you don't know where the server is, and the server doesn't know where you are, but you two can talk to each other. The .onion address is not like DNS in the traditional sense, the long hexadecimal name is a hash of the service's public key. This way, anyone with the .onion address can verify the identity of the service it's talking to, so in a way the address is like an SSL certificate.
When you connect to a hidden service, the three-relay circuit thing is used, but to give both sides anonymity each party has their own circuit, and they meet at a rendezvous point. So then there's six relays between the two of you.

Tor exit node operator here. I held an AMA earlier.
Actually, it's been pretty smooth. I set up the DNS so that the hostname clearly specified that it was a Tor exit node, configured the Tor configuration according to guidelines, and then monitoring it. It wasn't a big deal. I have had to deal with a dozen or so email complaints upstream that my ISP has handed off to me, but those were easily taken care of and are very little compared to the hundreds of terabytes that have moved through over the last six months without complaint.

Yep. I predict that this whole thing will be a bubble. It can't just keep going up like this, it's going to cycle back down at some point.

That's not updates, you're advertising.

I currently participate in Folding Wikipedia, and Tor, and I've been seriously considering getting involved in Bitcoin. I run Linux, so I went and downloaded the Bitcoin-QT software. Why is that I have to download the entire 11 GB of blockchains? I'm new to Bitcoin, but I'd like to help the network out as I can. It just seems to me that joining a cryptosystem that has that big of footprint is going to be problematic for some people. Why can't I just download the last gigabyte or so? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:40:52
Thanks very much. I too am glad that it worked out. I will be certain to look at the sidebar and that link. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:34:25
Thank you for getting back to me. I understand, and like I said I blame them and not you. You guys had a great form and it was easy to buy BTC, it just got sketchy when I got transferred to the LiqPay site. I haven't had a need to buy BTC recently due to the price increases, but when you guys finish your transition I'd be happy to try again. If you have time, please keep me posted. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:15:22
You are still welcome to build that rig. Projects like Folding could really benefit from more computational power.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:39:30
Ok, thanks for the info. I guess I'll continue to download the entire blockchain and continue to poke around on the website.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:47:13
Thanks! I'm confused though, how can I get bitcoins to my wallet here? Does your tip work as Reddit gold or something? How is my Bitcoin address/key thing tied to my Reddit account?
Once I understand, I think I'll use that bot a bit more myself. :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:42:21
Mine helped me recover from a scam! :)
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:34:10
Is there any way to contribute to the network with a smaller footprint? I'd be happy to contribute network or computational resources and help with verification or whatever, it's just odd to download the entire blockchain when so many of the transactions are from years ago. The graph on that website also shows that the size is growing exponentially.
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:27:26
Np, I learned a lot. Put a few bucks in the wallet, and got an app for my phone. :)
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:22:22
Thanks so much for the help. It's a cool project, and I'm understanding a lot more, thanks to my ability to move your tip around!
In return,

I had canceled all pending transactions with LiqPay in light of this, but today they tried to charge me again. I just happened to check my bank account activity and noticed it. Again, the bank sorted it out, and are sending me a new debit card because I consider the one I used to be now compromised. LiqPay will never again process my business.
I don't like shouting on the Internet, but for this I make an exception: ANYONE INTERESTED IN BUYING BITCOINS SHOULD DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO AVOID USING LIQPAY!

Supply and demand. Right now the demand is pretty high.
