It's only illegal says the U.S. government; kind of a fundamental behind a lot of what's going on with Crypto.
So if i told my neighbor the model car they own is illegal, I obviously have the right to seize it.

The same reason for the stock market crash in the 1920's...  Big money bought low, bumped the value up using media/whatever, sold out, in this case got in kahoots with the exchanges to close of new money (removed buying support), then again used the media to toss out headlines that were disproving to misleading.
Notice tether shut down new accounts yet doesn't have the same business model as like a coinbase/bittrex?

What this article also doesn't point out that typically other alt coins get hit harder when bitcoin's price drops.  This isn't 100% true as on rare occasion bitcoin might drop 3% and maybe eth only drops 2%, or like today VeChain might be the only in the green bucking the trend.  However it seems to want to perhaps mislead the reader to think that altcoins are some kind of safe haven.
We need a Bitcoin / Altcoin Factcheck site calling out what is true, untrue, and misleading in news stories.
What is probably more significant in this article is the sharing of user's trade data slipped in.

Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bittrex, and Tether (probably closely linked to Bitfinex) are in kahoots on suspending new account creation with an exoteric justification of "servers are overwhelmed".
They are creating artificial lack of demand.
Tether had an attack back in November that really was the weak link.  If one can buy Tether from fiat that can be then sent to other exchanges creating demand.  I call nonsense.
It's more difficult for the media to manipulate the markets  this way; most people are in a HOLD/SELL state while keeping out new money from the system.
I have numerous friends that want to buy into BTC (and other crypto) however can't due to the systems to do so for new users.
Yes, bitcoin needs to die for other tech to flourish but it's being done is a shady manner.
There also needs to be a class action lawsuit formed against Bittrex for stealing NEO GAS.  NEO GAS is effectively an intergral split of the NEO coin.  Exchanges like Binance and Kucoin appear to properly award NEO GAS to holders in their wallets.  Bittrex has been doing this since trading NEO.  If they can't support the coin and this feature of it they should not offer it on the exchange as it's theft.  This is where regulations need to be imposed.  Complain to the SEC; there's actually an option that would cover this under "Other fraud" in the complaint process.

Many exchanges have the ability to immediately convert deposits into fiat.  I think coinbase offers that.

I sensed they are however.  A few times i've sent support requests in English they've replied in English which is a shame as i have enjoyed the exchange and response times on service requests.  However typically the emails sent out have headers that are not in English so perhaps get overlooked.  We all get a lot of emails and skim over many.
However, on the last one where i tried verifying my identity and told they don't verify US citizens you'd think they'd tell me i need to close my account. As you see with the SMS issue (i don't receive it) if i ever needed to disable/reenable 2FA i'd never be able to withdraw.

It seems quite a few exchanges this isn't a problem
I'm being told that "preferably" i have to physically come to Bali.  This.... isn't Honorable.  This is the type of thing that creates a social media wildfire.
I opened the account and as of a week or two ago could remove funds even if at a slow pace.  I didn't authorize removal of email 2FA but just the login QR code.  This is an obvious attempt at preventing me from removing funds whatsoever.  
I might need to contact the U.S. embassy and news media at this point.  There's also a consulate of Indonesia office within biking distance.
It's sad as i do think the exchange has been reasonable until this 2FA issue.

Bitcoin.co.id is effectively freezing my account and not verifying u.s. citizens.  I signed up in 2015 and then needed to move my 2FA around and the SMS doesn't go through that also allows me to withdraw.  But i need the SMS to withdraw.  Prior to disabling 2FA all i needed to do was click a link in my email (a form of 2FA).  I didn't agree to change this 2FA method instead of SMS when disabling the google authenticator.
I don't read Indonesian and don't recall getting any form of notice to contact information regarding what countries could and could not use the service.  So i'm kind of getting funds frozen and withheld (hopefully not seized) without notice.  If this was the case, when logging in i should of got a warning i could only withdraw (no trading must close) as Bitfinex does/did with U.S. citizens.  
How can a u.s. citizen close their account properly? I submitted a valid passport/normal verification asks however told "we don't verify U.S. citizens".  However I'm also not getting SMS's to my phone number listed (U.S. area code) so i can't use that as 2FA to withdrawal.
I also cannot change the information on the account to another phone number, email address, address, and so on since i cannot verify the account.
I'm obviously proving my ownership and identify of the funds in the account.

Still no resolution.  This seems rather simple.  It would appear they're blocking SMS to the U.S.  Prior to 2FA being disabled (transferring phones) the way i approved was having email verification on withdrawals.   I have plenty of examples of that working.  I didn't approve this changing.  Having a U.S. phone number doesn't even require being a U.S. citizen.  One can have a google voice number or simply have a +1 cell phone area code by sim or whatever.  Thing is i can't even change that information without now verifying identity (submitted documents but rejected).
This is getting a theft vibe.  I'm pretty sure the Bitcoin community won't approve when hearing about this.  I've done nothing wrong however not acceptable to force someone to travel 2 days to Bali (a $1500-$2000 flight), 2 days back, and be exposed to being robbed, extortion and so on.

I think it was the opposite.  AC current is the one deemed more deadly (like electric chairs).  Edison was trying to induce fear to Tesla's AC current for a while.  
DC current wouldn't require that many wires but rather just one. As you note they're trying to show a cluster F\*ck of overhead wires.

There's some rather obvious Gematria (septenary) that links all three of those characters but too much to detail here.
If you're trying to claim Jesus was a real person you're off your rocker...  Euclid (note wiki) states similar.  
Jesus Christ is linked to the Euclid number:
E6 = 13# + 1 = 30031 = 59 × 509 is the first composite Euclid number, demonstrating that not all Euclid numbers are prime (aka sorta perfect).  
13 = GOD (septenary) 7+2+4 =13... "spark big things...." right
John 1:3  (GOD)
Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
here's that... sparking big things right...?
See the E6 note above...
"thing and nothing"
5*9 = 45
5*0*9 = 0  
45....  This
Jesus 
45 is also the magic square summation of Saturn (god of time) (15x3, 3x3 matrix)
666 - the magic square summation for the sun...  (6x6 matrix)

Well...  Being Satoshi is a fictional character similar to Jesus Christ and Euclid ofAlexandria someone had to do real work to compose the Bitcoin Code.   This is similar to writing the Bible over time (a lot of evidence is out there of teams of writers/translators etc), and the team of writers that composed Euclid's works they probably didn't work for free.  
So in that regard there was probably someone being paid somewhere.  However if using rounding perhaps it was less than $500,000,000 so $0 B is could be correct.

Bitcoin will go to the waist side for anon coins like Monero and Zcash.  
Or... bitcoin will morph to add they're anon features in. 
There's no real need for the current Bitcoin vs. improving those types of coins.
On the "blockchain" side governments don't want to kill crypto.  in fact they want them to thrive as it's more control/invasive.

Coinbase and friends effectively accelerated the crash by preventing people from investing (no buyers avail).  All of them (including the lie tether broadcast "hacked") prevented the market from kind of going sideways rather than dropping like 9/11.  Didn't NIST speak up lately with another opinion?  Kind of symbolic after their 9/11 science-less garbage reports.

The best place to mine would be before a revenue meter at a power plant; no transmission cost and the power is at cost.  It would effectively be a house (slang for on site) load like a pump.  
For example in the U.S. power in like Missouri would be really cheap.  So tap off a plant that is likely barely profitable to run as is undercutting the hash/power cost mining equation.

Satoshi Nakamoto has pretty obvious gematria and story like link to Euclid "ofAlexandria" and Jesus Christ (Septenary Cipher); none of them actually exist but were a team of writers/developers; pure fictional (Jesus is science fiction really).
This article was in October 2017.... same thing in it and notice the numbers called out.  the exact prices that safe limit orders to sell (19600) and buy (5900) should of been placed at.
on the bight side, the last number not to be met yet is 980,000
