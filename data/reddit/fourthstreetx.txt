Yeah, and if another larger whale decides to buy 10,000 BTC during the time the first whale is dumping all his coins.  The price goes up, FOMO and then the first whale panic buys at 1,075$ losing many BTC.  Nobody can time the markets.  There are thousands of whales all playing this game at simultaneously.

Never tell me the odds!
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:17:33
Never wait, always buy now! I have no idea...
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:24:53
Good, I have also been a pretty constant buyer since BTC was $200 (not $2, $200 sadly).  I did however buy into ETH very low and suggest you read up on ETH if you haven't.  I think it is the future (BTC as well - I am 20%BTC 80%ETH)
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:06:57
Now just imagine you had waited until $2 to buy in the first place.  How good would that have been? (Or even sold at $16 and then bought back in at $4).  I would say 4x better at the very least.

It isn't necessarily in direct competition with Bitcoin.  About 100,000,000 will be produced.  The reward schedule is 5 ETH per block right now but that will change later this year.  Vitalik does not control ETH, he simply has a lot of pull because he is a smart person that helped create the vision for ETH &amp; most people agree makes choices that are in the best interest of the network.  If ETH is being used for applications and it is liquid and faster to use than other methods (such as bitcoin 10 mins Vs  12 seconds per transaction) I see no reason people would not be using it as money.  Overstock is about to add it as an additional payment option.

"Scumbag" = Someone who takes other people's tokens against their will and expectations.  
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:24:06
I do get the picture.  Maybe we are looking at different things (or from different distances).  I love BTC don't get me wrong.  I came into the crypto world through it like most people.  I still own a lot of them.  I just don't think it alone will be the end all be all in the space.

Far less at this point.  So many are lost or locked away never to be owned/moved again.
@_date: 2017-01-16 07:45:33
Um, if a 10 comes up you have a set on turn yeah, but you lose to any Q at that point.

So what you are saying is... The Chinese market is super liquid. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 16:04:54
Fiat money in my personal definition includes the fact that you can print more of it seemingly without limit. Try doing that past 21 million with bitcoin :)

Yes, and a Ford Fiesta is basically the same thing as a Tesla 70D.  You get what you pay for my friend.  but go cheap if you want to.    
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:20:12
it is too complex to discuss.  The point is, if they could reverse a large theft at an exchange without effecting (at least not directly) anyone except the thief and his victims to right the wrong doing they would.  ETH did and the rest is history.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:09:30
Yeah, they totally should have just let that scumbag run off with all the crypto he stole =p - I love how people think that undoing that theft was a bad thing.  If bitcoin could have reasonably undid the Mt. Gox incident they would have.  Keep chanting immutability though, like that means anything (especially when ETH at this point is nearly as immutable as BTC).  I won't feel sorry for you when you miss the ETH trian - it will be due to your own ignorance.  
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:00:17
lol, screwing a known scumbag is not a scumbag move.  Ask any non-scumbag 
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:34:53
You are free to make your own assumptions.  The number is not set in stone yet, but it is estimated at around 100,000,000 because within the next 18 months Ethereum is switching to proof of stake (energy efficient mining so we don't - you know... waste billions of dollars destroying the planet to secure our digital tokens).  Ethereum will also scale unlike Bitcoin while also being faster, programmable, and backed by more developers (at least for sure based on the developer to market cap ratio.)
I also don't see lots of major companies like Microsoft backing Bitcoin like they do Ethereum.  Do your homework, keep an open mind and you will do fine in this space.  Blow emerging networks that are supported by Coinbase off at your own peril.  Dogecoin LMFAO a hahahaha yes, a real store of value that will be I am sure!

I sold 75% of my remaining BTC at $906 and am kind of sweating that decision as well.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:22:46
Ever play with ETH? I believe in ETH now even though I started as a Bitcoiner. (I still use BTC but rarely)

You are right, lawyers do round up. Will be $1,000/hour.

Plenty of people know how to spend and accept dollars, the same is just not true with Bitcoin within a random sample of people.  Even those as familiar with it as us on this subreddit would have a hard time spending it in an hour time limit.  Adoption and ease of use are both coming though, each growing adding synergy.  This is part of the reason we see exponential growth.

Now, before you bite my heads off people.  I am a fan of crypto and I understand that gold would have the exact same problem in addition to also being harder to carry physically XD

They literally wouldn't even be able to "give" the money away if they tried.  BTC unfortunately is that young right now.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:58:03
Buzzer sounds!  "Sorry kid you are out of time, you found zero people that accept Bitcoin in the hour and even if you did the confirmation times alone would have exceeded an hour."  - And watching you try to send it would have also been great as well. lol we need to make this easier people!
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:56:47
I'm down to try that out.
