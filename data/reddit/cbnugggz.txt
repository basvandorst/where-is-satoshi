Uh oh. Now it's $1.37.

Because the point is for it's value to increase... that's what happens with finite supplies. Why else would someone buy something (bitcoins) with a real currency to pay for a product or service? Bitcoins aren't going to replace regulated currency. So why spend them if they are built to deflate? 
Trends prove it. People aren't spending them. They're hoarding them. And even at that, it's only an extremely small percentage of people that are doing so. Primarily because it takes wealth to accumulate them.
It's a lottery for the circle jerks of "let's get rich without actually doing anything."
It represent everything that is wrong with economics while trying to sell it as a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

Exactly. Which is nothing like a currency, or one of the "greatest inventions of the last 20 years" like OP claims.
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:01:42
I down voted it because it doesn't make a bit of sense.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:22:53
Because you can't do that with a finite supply like bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:50:37
When someone claims Golf is the greatest "book" of the last twenty years, yes, people will object to it. That's what happens when you claim something that's is absurdly false about it like claiming Bitcoins is the wave of the future and one of the greatest inventions of the last twenty years....
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:40:02
There is nothing wrong with saving. It's simply nothing like what OP claims it to be as "one of the most important inventions of the last 20 years."
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:29:36
My point exactly. It's not revolutionary, it's not a "great invention," and it's not the future.
It's a finite "resource" pretending to be more than it really is.
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:23:04
Again, that doesn't make any sense. 
Simple question: why spend a bitcoin if it continues to increase in value? 
Simple answer: you don't.
End of story. It's not a currency. It's a stock.
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:00:53
Bitcoin is hardly for the people. Unless of course "the people" are those that already have wealth.
It's completely speculative, incredibly volatile, and unregulated. That isn't the future. It's a horror show of pseudo economics parading around as a legit currency.
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:44:46
So it's dependent on numerous things. Primarily tech devices, an existing tech infrastructure, a network that isn't proprietary, etc. 
It's everything that a real currency is not. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:21:09
Yup. It's an attempt to privatize a monetary system.
Except it won't work. It doesn't even stand a chance. Primarily because it has no state. 
This is some Thatcher-esque idea that will most likely just encourage the public to fix our existing monetary system, not abandon it completely for a new one. Especially an unregulated, unpredictable, and anonymous form.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:58:29
Sorry my mobile auto fills text. And that it has nothing to do with the discussion...
I'm here because OP claimed something that is purely false. I see the benefit and value of bitcoin. But that value is highly overstated.
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:00:51
No one ever thought of a finite product to use as exchange? Really? No one?
I think you probably failed history class...
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:54:50
Lol. That's like saying books are an information medium.
It doesn't change the facts behind it. What financial operation is going to risk it's state licenses for the sake of an unregulated, completely volatile, and unproven system?
It's not the wave of the future like OP claims and it certainly is not for the people. It is another attempt in the long history of fiat currencies to curb the system. And it will fail. Primarily because it has nothing to do with the state.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:10:31
Ask yourself what has happened to the majority of wealth in the last thirty years and the reexamine what you just said.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:56:07
Lol, and EVERY economic indicator would say you're wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:47:29
That's what the trend is. Like stocks, not currency.
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:56:09
I agree. And even further, the mere mention of a group not partaking (ie China) sends it's "value" through the floor.
It was dead before it was even alive.
