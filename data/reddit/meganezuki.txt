Is anyone else getting an error 404 when trying to login to the real Kraken? o.o

Thank you, it is working for me again as well. That uncertainty though...

Tell that to the owner of Cryptsy. Stole their users' balances, closed down the exchange and fled to China. I had BTC and alts there since 2013 and it was all gone. Now there is a legal case but the compensation is a tiny portion divided among affected users. Also had money at Crypto-Trade, they didn't steal but they closed down the exchange with a 48 hour warning. No need to mention the Mt. Gox case...
DO NOT leave money in any exchange or online platform, unless you plan on trading in the short term. If you wanna mid-long term hold, you must hold it literally; with a hardware wallet, a piece of paper or whatever method you choose. You should take this stuff very seriously.

I think  is the standard most people use for daily news.

By late 2013, BTC China (largest exchange in the country) stopped taking deposits and shortly after Mt. Gox stopped trading altogether. Back then, Mt. Gox alone represented 70% of the worldwide BTC trading volume.

I have done two deposits with them recently and didn't have any issue. Hope it's solved soon.

You did the right thing. I'm about to do the same.

Yeah except in exactly 1 week CME's futures will begin, which will be much bigger than today's CBOE futures.

They simply open their mouth and all the plankton goes in.

I mean it does work, it just takes a few attempts and it's a bit slow at the moment probably due to the workload. But to be quite honest it's the same across many sites, in a certain exchange I couldn't even log in.
No reason to wait though, just try. I guess the hype will last for a while so just need to have patience with some the websites.

Meanwhile I'm buying Ethereum, gonna be nice when it bounces back.

The other reply you got already explains how to move it to Ledger, but I just wanna second that this is the way to go if you want to keep your btc safe in the long term.
I know you've probably read this many times now, but I must insist. Don't leave your btc in the balance of an exchange if you aren't planning to trade in the short term and just want to hold. I learned this the hard way when I lost 200 euros worth of btc that I had on Cryptsy. That exchange "disappeared" with people's money and the owner flew away to China. It wasn't a major exchange site but still shows what could happen if you are careless like I was.

You still have to pay fees to your bank for sending money to fund your Coinbase account. At least that's how it's like in Europe, I'm not sure how it works between US banks though.

Coinbase is having trouble processing payments today.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:01:29
Unfortunately there is no way to ACH internationally so if you are outside of the US (where Coinbase is based) you will have to pay wire transfer fees which in some cases can be even higher than Coinbase's fees. That's why I stick to Kraken even though it's broken af.

Yeah, they updated the website, seems like they aren't accepting new claims.

Feeling suicidal because of 5 BTC? How about this? 


At today's rate, those pizzas would have been bought for $100.000.000

The intention is good, but to an outsider with no knowledge on the matter, seeing that they need many months of no smoking to buy 1 bitcoin might discourage them, it's like putting a mountain in front of them and saying: Go ahead, climb it. Instead, we should make the first few steps of the journey look as simple as possible. You can literally take a few bucks today and put them into bitcoin to buy a fraction of it, that sounds so much more appealing than "It would take you 10 months, 13 days to buy 1 Bitcoin at $3994.00 if you quit smoking today." which is what the site says. Not to mention that in 10 months God knows what the price will be, so it's not even giving an accurate representation. This assumes that the price will stay the same which couldn't be further from reality.

Too many people in that thread are in desperate need of Andreas Antonopoulos' doses of truth, but they don't know yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:50:45
Thank you for the update. I believe the balance won't matter since the compensation will be a share of the total money that can be redeemed, as you mentioned.
I will contact the team in P.A. too. Good luck mate.
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:25:41
It was indeed a learning experience, but I feel the same way you do. I have only become interested recently because of the lack of news regarding this case, which I thought was a bit suspicious. I read the guy who ran this exchange fled to China after the scandal.

I updated the post with some info, but the deadline to file a claim was in June so it's too late. I can't find info regarding the outcome of the trial and what happens to those who didn't file a claim (it just says we might still be entitled to something) but realistically I wouldn't expect anything. I'll let you know if I find anything.
