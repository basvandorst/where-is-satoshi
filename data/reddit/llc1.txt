That's a good idea!
But how could an entity confirm that e.g. a passport scan really belongs to a wallet holder? A bad actor could use stolen/fake passport scans.

interesting points, thanks for your input!

Please read my OP post. "classic credit card payments are a disclosure in themselves as they require full name and address matching".
That's the difference.. I'm unsure what degree of KYC is required by the average merchant but the CC itself is disclosing a lot.

I understand, but this still doesn't make a difference from the merchants point of view. The merchant would have no way to verify if such recurring instruction is setup. I have yet to see something like this work..
Regarding KYC, it's not about fraud protection, ofc it can't be charged back anyway.
It's about money laundry laws. The merchant might have to be required by law to know his customer.

- at least "BTC IN"
- easy implementation with Coinbase
- Island of Man mentality
I wouldn't add more as too many points might be too confusing for them

Maybe we could convince them to do only "BTC IN" for now.
As I assume "BTC OUT" would cause the biggest headache for their business model.
(in other words, you can send BTC to your neteller account but can only withdraw/send fiat from it).
They could implement "BTC IN" easily with e.g. Coinbase

;) I know how easily things can escalate on reddit so I'm trying to keep it down

Right, that's part of the equation.
I find it incredibly fascinating how balanced bitcoin mining is. Setting all the incentives right while still keeping everything working. At the same time I'm wondering if everything would fail if the equation was even slightly off.
But then, that's life. If earth was only a few degree warmer we wouldn't be alive.
Is it safe to say that Bitcoin works because it still does?

Recurring billing works because it's not rational. Consumerism as a whole isn't rational, but that's a different (and long) story.
Manually sending an amount is very rational though... so it's really not the same.
There might be abuse of such models as you suggested, but traditionally this doesn't work as this leads to complaints and chargebacks which jeopardizes your venture very quickly.

Quoting from Gavin on this issue:
The limiting factor is checking to see if the transaction is valid or not (the CPU cost of ECDSA signature verification).  When the transaction volume gets high enough miners will have to start prioritizing which transactions they check, and they will use transaction fees as a quick initial check to see if they should invest CPU cycles to include transactions in a block.  Yes, miners want to include as many transactions with fees as possible in their blocks, but it won't be economical for any miner or mining pool operator to include an infinite number of them.
And speaking of mining pools... they are a lot more efficient than individual miners because they allow transactions to be verified once instead of requiring that all of the miners in the pool do that work.  Very small miners will be driven to join a mining pool, and the big mining pools will be competing to have the lowest fees and highest payouts (and so will be optimizing their ECDSA verification code and will figure out which transactions are profitable and which aren't).
So:  I don't think bitcoin will have very few miners.  I think it will have lots of miners connected to a smaller number of mining pools, and the whole system will optimize itself to be wonderfully efficient.

Good input, thank you!

Let's use a nicer tone please :)
Regarding "where I have the numbers", I'm in the industry myself. 
Everything that isn't recurring simply won't convert.. Or at least you can't compete.
To give you a clear example, I guarantee that an online dating site without recurring billing would have no chance to compete against an online dating site that uses recurring billing.
The point is, this is an incentive for merchants to accept credit cards over bitcoin.
And what I'm trying to say is, this incentive is much stronger than most think it is. Recurring billing is **the** golden nugget for merchants..
I find your other paragraphs rather provocative and unconstructive so I rather not answer to that.

if this is true, then why is the block 10kb and not 1kb or 1 byte?
