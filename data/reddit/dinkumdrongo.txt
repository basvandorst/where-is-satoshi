Without a doubt there is room for crypto. There's a fucking need for it.
I'll hodl.
Edit: fuck but two seconds later my brain says, but is there a need for Bitcoin? Monero eg

There are three *solutions*.
Sit back as a passive player and hope the day traders churn the price up again.  I have no cash to help push, aside from taking out a loan.
Cash out.  Give up the dream.  Pocket $150K. Maybe save $150K.  Maybe lose $3M.
Hodl with neither of the above.  Virtuously fight on for change. See if the pawn shop accepts used toasters.

Not bad advice. Might cash out 40%
Anymore and it will hurt too much when the rebound hits.
Any less and it will be the floor hurting too much.

I'll give you more than the tip if you're right

Lock in a price

$20K was different, emotionally, to all prior spikes
Okay so $10K came close and we're hovering over it again

Not like this, though, not by a stretch in dollar terms
Also, side note.  I've been a Bitcoin believer for years.  I still believe in crypto.  But I also believe that as long as governments required taxes in USD then Bitcoin would only ever be an alt.  And that was part of the future I believed in.  The ability to dip in and out of regulated finance at your own discretion.  Crypto won't replace fiat until governments stop requiring taxes in fiat; but crypto does replace most of  the banking system.

Not bad

Yeah but that first device was superseded. It was a telephone, not a device that transmitted "voice like sounds", that changed the world.
Sorry but this crash, of them all, has me feeling shit
