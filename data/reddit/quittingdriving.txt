What motivates you?
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:12:20
As your portfolio manager, thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-12 06:06:17
It sounds terrible. I feel sorry for you. You tried to keep the investment small to reduce exposure to risk and it keeps increasing in size to thwart your plans.
@_date: 2014-01-12 05:46:41
Contribute scams?
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:58:37
...much better
Malware could get smart in its wallet hunting methods.especially when dumbasses share their non encrypted methods of hiding files in pain sight.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:46:40
It really doesn't defeat the purpose
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:03:11
It takes seconds to clear a bitcoin transaction. The cost of a double spend attack is astronomical. 8 seconds and a double spend can easily be detected. Reliable enough for merchants to use up to$10k transactions

That guy is the bitcoin president. Can we clone him?

They get free marketing and publicity by accepting bitcoin.

Where does that number come from?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:10:55
Either 999 or 1001

I second the motion. I mean, upvote.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:15:10
Don't give your cash to your very good friend. You encrypted your wallet to prevent theft. I hope you did the same with your friends copy. Put an encrypted version (truecrypt) online out in a different building from your other copies.

what is the solution for increasing block size in bitcoin? If it doesn't happen and transaction fees go up, other coins will look more attractive.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:26:31
Yet, it's terrible how the block reward halves and the value of bitcoin increases by a vast amount more than that. I mined back in 2011 on a cpu. It's much bigger nowadays and run by pools those transaction fees need to be competitive or that's where alt coins will come in.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:55:26
Mine are on the moon

Offline computer with armory. Encrypt everything and have encrypted backups using truecrypt. Online computer should only have a watching wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:19:11
Nervous about a check? They are easy to cancel. I've sent money using a check but not large amounts.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:28:48
That doesn't help for calculating capital gains since most trading is done at exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:50:43
It'll cause panic. Especially the software release to increase the block size
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:37:29
6 donations so far and someone just gave a whole bitcoin. I suspect this post made the one bitcoin donation happen.

I remember the post. Good ending
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:53:48
I'd get behind this
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:21:21
I've been using bitcoin since 2011 and understand private/public keys. Heck, I write security software for embedded software using seed/key challenge mechanisms.
I really don't think you understand the question.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:52:26
Someone will have shorted bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:04:02
I'm not sure what that video has to do with the question I asked. I'm wondering how deep Armory checks addresses in the blockchain using the chain/key when restoring from a backup.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:02:12
Free cookies with bitcoin! Awesome.
Seriously, awesome app.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:35:46
I have both installed. They look good. I'm an armory guy at the moment.

Just keep clicking "receive bitcoins"? It doesnt seem a great solution - but it is a solution.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:30:46
At first I thought it was a wallet, I've got too much installed. Looks like an app I never used.
DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. IT FLAGS AS ADWARE.

2, but they pay rent
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:31:09
What if you lost your history of transactions and the exchanges only have 6 months worth so lost them? How do you calculate capital gains accurately.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:09:43
Not really, I predict a mass sell off of subscribers when it hits 90000
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:35:06
Change in volume at that price

use bitcoinium or litecoin widget (shows many currencies including bitcoin)

More transactions per block means more revenue...unless there is a limit on the block size. If so, maybe increase it?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:35:00
Wtf you smoking?

If only it was called byte coin, then we could start using nibble coin..and then bitcoin.

The case against fiat..
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:14:36
I still think of the key as a way to unlock money (a balance) on the blockchain. An offline wallet is a key that has never been online. If it has a balance, it can be seen online in the transparent safe.
For the masses, ok, call it storage.

What is the orphan rate of 1 second blocks?

What's your opinion on primecoin? It searches for prime chains. People claim they are useful.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:35:34
The private keys are like the combination to the safe. The safe is an address. If the address hasn't been used in the blockchain, it is empty. If the address is on the blockchain, the private key keys you spend the balance as shown in the blockchain. The bitcoin is in the blockchain. If a different blockchain was somehow used than the one I'd been using for my transactions, my private keys would be for empty addresses/safes. To boost the analogy, the safe is transparent, you can see the balance by looking at the public key.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:40:31
I'd say you are correct that you are wrong all the time.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:59:00
Does zerocoin solve this?

I use this math all the time. I get the small pizza and give my wife a quarter and tell her it's infinitely divisible so therefore it is infinite. I don't think it's like throwing bullshit against the wall but my wife throws the pizza against the wall. More for me!
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:33:33
Is it possible to test the code on a test bitcoin network that creates blocks much faster than 10 minutes to allow for increased test coverage over many blocks?
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:23:29
I think people try to hack these websites all the time

he sold 5000 on bitstamp before he wrote that and bought 5000 on coinbase afterwards
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:44:40
Wallets don't store bitcoin, they hold the keys to them. When the explanation for the answer says "store" then you know it isn't an accurate description.

It's great when you add pepperoni on it

Use an offline computer running armory.even more secure.

Jeez, this isn't good for coinbase. Especially if a whale uses it.

That is a much better use of the bitbar name.
Bitbar is also the name of a (shitty) alt coin.
