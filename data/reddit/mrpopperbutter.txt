Implementation is the same, mainnet and testnet run exactly the same code, except they have different blockchains.  Running on mainnet is just changing a setting in the LN wallet.  What you're looking for is a threshold where people trust their real money on mainnet LN, which will not be a black-and-white moment, but rather a gradual process.
P.S. The Lightning developers keep a list of tests they put the software through.  The idea is, when the software passes all the tests, it's ready.  All 3 implementations of LN pass all the tests, so it's basically alpha/beta software at this point.

Switching from testnet to mainnet is usually just a matter of configuration.  The LN devs aren't going to package a 1-click option for you until they think it's ready, but all the clients are open source so have at it.

Loans made on LN could still default, like any loan.  The 0 counterparty risk applies only within the game that is LN, so neither party can run off with more Bitcoin than they're supposed to have.  And the risk is very low but not 0, because you must have, or hire, a machine to watch the blockchain and send out a punishment TX if your counterparty tries to cheat.  If you fail to have a watchdog, they can get away with cheating after a timelock expires.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:04:56
Fees get too high, masses rush to BCH, Fiat, alts, etc.  If those are as decentralized, we've still got the revolution we wanted.  Just bad for traders holding BTC.
If they are more centralized, we're back to where we were before Bitcoin, but with the added option of using Bitcoin again.
If they don't provide scaling solutions, but LN does, we just switch back to Bitcoin.

Well it's a Chaumian CoinJoin, which means the central server that gathers coins has been blinded; it has no idea which coins are whose. Also there's no way for it to take anyone's coins, because the outputs are signed by them first. So pretty bulletproof.
As for counterarguments: to make the coins untraceable, all participants must use the same value. The amount is broken into, say, 0.01BTC chunks.
Any leftover change is still traceable to them. It just has to wait for the next mixing round. It takes many cycles to fully hide coins, and this is expensive in fees.
Coinjoin has more effect with more participation, so current lack thereof would be another downside.
Schnorr allows us to take a signature for a payment (65 bytes) and aggregate it with all the signatures in a transaction. 5 signatures? Now 1 signature. 1000 signatures? Now 1 signature. Just 65 bytes, no matter how many.
The more participants in the transaction, the more they save on fees per person. And while they're at it, they might as well use amounts that make it difficult to trace.
If they do this on every transaction, they can have a wallet where all the coins have a very low probability of connecting to them. Use those coins to fund onion-routed Lightning channels, and you've got really good anonymity.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:51:38
Not directly. Under Schnorr it will be cheaper to coinjoin with others than to not do so. And with LN network today it's significantly more private.

No, they provide more than that. Schnorr incentivizes coinjoining. Currently coinjoin is more expensive than just being traced. Under Schnorr you'll pay less in fees by combining your tx with others. Wallets can provide the mixing server as a built-in service. Samourai are already working on it with Whirlpool.
When the majority of transactions are joined, it will decimate the snoops ability to snoop.
Schnorr also enables point-time-locked-contracts (PTLC rather than HTLC) in Lightning. These will make many routing features, like 
*  Multi-path, so your max payment can be the sum of your channels combined, rather than just your biggest channel.
* Rendezvous onion routing, so the receiver is anonymized too.
* Trampoline routing, so routing works well even when the LN grows 100x in number of nodes.
much easier to develop. If you read the lightning-dev mailing list, it sure seems like all the cool routing features require PTLC, which requires Schnorr.

Like said, there are no ROI guarantees. First, decide what you believe about Bitcoin. I think it stands a good chance of eventually becoming the reserve currency of the solar system. Assuming that happens, then the demand will go from maybe a couple million people today, to billions of people. There are only 21 million BTC total. If demand increases by orders of magnitude, value will as well.

Money is a finite state machine we use to evaluate and exchange value. To spend money is an act of expression; it's to say "I esteem this item to be worth X". This is the only way the value of anything can be ascertained, in a free market where people willingly choose it over other options.
To tax anyone at percentage Y is to say "You are not permitted to value your government at any less than Y/100 of your hours of labor". When they've paid Y, they get no control over what it's actually spent on. Somebody else, a representative, does this. The representative is also a citizen, and supposedly also has the same rights, but they get to decide what Y/100 of everyone else's value goes to. They get to regulate everyone else's expression of value.
So a democracy with taxation amounts to saying: We need to vote on authorities to decide what the value floor of government projects should be. Predictably, unavoidably, that floor constantly rises.
So I'm against 1 because it's a violation of the same principle that underlies the First amendment: it's a regulation of expression.
2 is moot to me because I don't think government should extend corporate immunity, where the individual owners aren't liable for all the company's actions, at all in the first place.
3 As long as they're mandatory, they are regulated expression. That can't be improved, it will always be anti-freedom.
4. Digital cash will make tax evasion as easy as movie piracy, and we'll be better off for it. Institutions should have to earn their value willingly. Any institution that gets to extract revenue coercively cannot be trusted to act other than in its own interest to keep existing and growing.
5 I think you're whole way of describing it is part of a mass lie. There aren't any free things for the public. We are forced to pay for projects that are supposedly so important we must have them "for free". This is insanity.

It's programmable money.  I can write a little script describing how a UTXO can be redeemed, and nothing but the proper execution of my script can move those funds.  Ethereum's script is Turing complete, so you can write any program with it, but there's some added stability in using a more limited script that's just for payments.

The swapper will decide its own exchange rate by whatever means it desires, and your wallet will pick the swapper by whatever rules you/the devs prefer. You could go for the best rate, or the most anonymous node, etc. A wallet could provide you with options, or just use a default.
As far as LTC being dead, I think it's probably the best non-turing-complete crypto after BTC, mainly because they're just faster at adopting new changes, like segwit. LTC makes a good testing ground for new Bitcoin features. And, to be honest, I love how much faster it is at confirming txs.
That said, 90% of my crypto is BTC, with a little ETH on the side.

It can actually just be one big network, with all coins. Soon there will be swapper nodes who automatically exchange coins they receive. You'll be able to visit a merchant who only accepts LTC, even if you only have BTC, and make the payment instantly and seamlessly. This is because your LN wallet will add a swapper to your payment route, so BTC leaves you, but LTC is received by the merchant.
