Thinking about cashing out 500 VEN for a nice date for my wife and I. Then may diversify into TNB and Dogecoin looking for some quick gains before she cashes me out again.

Dumb post. Can't even follow the grading scale, and I disagree strongly with Ethereum getting a lower rating than frickin Cardano? or frickin Z cash, is this a friggin' joke? Come on!

XLM will be an A rating and bitcoin will be a C-. Walter Coin will be the only coin to receive an A+ rating. You heard it here first nerds.

Thanks for the input. Unfortunately, Stewie managed to guess my password and took my BTC and converted it all to NEM. I guess I should have assumed these young folk could crack "Crypto-Grandpa" as my password!
