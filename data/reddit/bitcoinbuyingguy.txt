I’m not sticking it into shitty “hopes and dreams” coins.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:37:05
I’m not going to lose money.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:58:28
So i’d just do a couple of £ above the current price and i’m good?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:56:29
Done the first part. I’m investing what i want to earn back.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:17:43
I can’t lose money if I withdraw before the price goes down
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:48:14
On a real though, look at the prices between 9 and 1 for the past few days this week, 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:57:22
Unless you enter in January 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:01:10
Already have
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:20:23
How much
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:32:34
Well, I do need an advisor to tell me when to buy and when to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:46:25
Well I don’t have 100,000
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:46:16
Might as well send me $5000 if it’s so small to you
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:53:44
If i look at a roulette table, and there’s an exploit, the guy isn’t losing money.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:39:10
Yeah good luck with that
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:45:26
That’s the spirit!
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:41:30
You buy on a growth. The burst happens around 9am-1pm GMT
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:31:24
Which is why i want an advisor 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:23:10
MFW you have to create imaginary scenarios because your argument got fucked.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:36:29
Gdax must have a catch. No way would they offer 0% fees with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:48:19
No thanks
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:23:40
You think i’m gonna sell low. I’m not.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:18:58
I want someone to help as i go along
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:44:14
On the coinbase app there’s alerts for when a price dips, all i gotta do is set one up on my investment. Surely there’s an auto sell feature.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:46:39
Oh god no.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:45:09
But they do know how to invest intelligently
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:18:10
Do they have fees?
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:01:23
Kraken is good?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:31:07
Say I invest at £8k. The price goes up to £8.4k. I can set myself an alert for when it goes below £8.3k to £8.1k and withdraw before it goes any lower.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:33:35
Hi reddit, I’m looking for a bitcoin wallet.
I’ve tried coinbase, I don’t like it. You have to wait a month to invest &gt; £750.00 and the fees are too high.
I would like an alternative.
Ideal qualities: (in no particular order)
1) 0% chance of getting scammed. 
2) NO LIMITS
3) LOW FEES
4) Easy access to buying and selling crypto.
5) alerts for prices.
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:49:26
Or i could buy on the dip
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:41:47
Only if i’m dumb
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:06:01
Hi reddit. 
I’m looking to invest some serious money into bitcoin. I’ve done a bit of research and I believe my best course of action is to hire an advisor, who can take a % cut of my earnings for giving me their advice. 
What would you guys do with this money?, would you stick it all in at once?, do multiple at a time. Let me know.
Thank you in advance.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:00:54
I’m not going to lose 5k
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:36:57
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:25:44
How much is very large?
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:03:48
Tell me more about gdax, what about gemini?, why does coinbase have higher fees?, there is a reason.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:09:43
I’m not gonna lose it though
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:04:53
If £5k isn’t serious you can send me one
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:50:35
I don’t have to prove anything to you
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:24:28
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:11:54
I’m only investing in one coin, they’re all too similar and it’s extra stress.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:16:09
I wanna use an advisor for that. They know more than me.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:19:54
Not interested in alt coins, too much upselling going on.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:38:43
An extra £5k, then use the money to travel in the summer, sticking my original investment back in the bank.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:46:39
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:45:59
What’s a limit order
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:39:30
Where did i say i was gonna sell low?
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:52:02
Money wasn’t available 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:00:18
But in principle, the transaction will be the same as coinbase?, no strings attached fucking around with delays or a certain withdraw limit?
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:09:34
It’s only gambling when you lose money
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:17:23
Saying that i’ll never sell high. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:12:48
How many times do i have to tell you to link a fucking comment as proof?.
Have fun waiting for a reply if your response doesn’t quote the part where I said i’d sell low. 
Edit: Lol i can edit my comments too?, Funny how that works.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:02:09
Ok, what’s a good exchange
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:48:13
Link where i said i’d sell low
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:23:36
Buy low, sell high. Where’s the problem?
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:45:33
By all means, if 5k is peanuts hmu with some
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:39:59
I really don’t want to buy with the chance of getting robbed.
I want something like coinbase. Easy to check the price on my phone, easy to buy and sell, but with no fees.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:31:56
Why would you need a minimum investment?
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:34:09
£5k if you wanna see us have a bitch fight irl
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:49:06
You wouldn’t buy before a dip
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:23:24
Do they have phone apps?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:21:09
My plan is to invest in bitcoin only
