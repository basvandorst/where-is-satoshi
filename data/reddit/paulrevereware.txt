He moved to Texas, a.k.a. The Deadbeat State, where he will likely be able to keep a lot of assets, even with judgements against him. Also, the vast majority of potential lawsuits from his fraud victims has been taken care of via the fake "GAWsuit" led by D. Allen Shinners and Josh Garza's old highschool  pal and BBFL , Adam Matlack, wherein the fraud victim signed a document saying he gives up his right to sue GAW/Garza on his own. And then nothing.....

Does it matter? He has already led 475+ of the fraud victims around in circles for damned near a year, and most of them are still following him. The time to strike while the iron is hot is long gone. This releases a HUGE financial liability from Homero. Probably the biggest financial liability he has from this fraud scheme, really.

What of the theory that Craig Wright = the Mystery whale GAW/Paycoin investor "Craig", who has long been rumored to be Hashtalk member Tankjnr AND he turns out to be Satoshi? 
Better invest in r/Buttcoin if that one pans out, shares will skyrocket on news that Satoshi Nakamoto has been Paycoined!

Went down just as it was revealed that Karsen Klock developed the software used by the latest Paycoin related scam "TNTswap", which is centered around the Paycoin clone scamcoin "TNT".
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:31:33
Indeed, with the addition of Hyperstaking wallets and a 98% premine. TNT looks to be even more of an obvious scamcoin, and is being run by some guy in India who refuses to even identify himself. He is also making a sham "exchange" that turns out to actually be just his Cryptsy address where he wants people to send coins, and then send him an email explaining how many coins they have deposited. He claims this is "unhackable" and 100% secure.

Says 145 today. Right now the limits of block size by spamming are hard to meet, but those limits are growing closer each day, and a lot of the transactions are indeed attempts to create extra blocks. When the 1 MB limit is reached on a regular basis, then the creation of extra blocks will be hard to stop. Right now the return of block spamming is minimal, but that is right on the verge of changing, which is why the block size increase is being discussed. If nothing is done, then you will have major players taking advantage of this exploit in a big way.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:00:39
Examine the numbers. The ideal target for block time is 10 minutes, which equals 144 blocks per day. If there are more transactions than can fit in that 144 blocks per day, then extra blocks are created to handle them. If you have 10% of the network hashrate, you would mine 14 blocks per day on average. If you can increase the number of blocks from 144 to 160 per day you would end up mining 16 blocks per day on average. If you don't think that increasing profits by 10% is worthwhile I do not know where to start with you.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:53:36
It sounds like you do not even understand what I am talking about. Block size increase is not about decreasing the likelyhood of an intentional DDOS attack, it is about decreasing the incentive to create an unintentional spam clog (DDOS) of the network by those who are profiting by creating extra blocks by sending BTC back and forth to themselves. Many say that more than 50% of all transactions are currently these ping pong transactions to create extra blocks, others say it is closer to 90%. If you increase Block size by 20x it will make the per block transaction fees also increase by 20x, which would remove the profit incentive for doing this.
@_date: 2015-05-25 15:31:11
I was under the impression that increasing the block size would make it harder to spam, particularly in the use of spam transactions to create extra blocks by those with a major amount of the Network hashpower. Right now there are about .2 BTC in fees for an average Block .  If you have 10% of the Network hashrate, you could spend .2 to create an extra block in a given period of time than would be created by legitimate transactions,(EVEN paying the fee to make sure they are included) from which (on average) you would collect 2.5 BTC. Pretty good return, and an unkown but sizable amount of current transactions are currently exactly this. If the Blocks were increased by 20x it should cost ~4 BTC to create an extra block, thereby eliminating the incentive to spam transactions to create extra blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:08:53
Wrong. The ideal target is 144 per day. There are usually more.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:30:12
DUH. That is what I said. At 1 MB block size it currently costs on average ~.2 BTC to create a real block, and with 20 MB blocks it would cost 4 BTC , thus stopping the spam block creation by major players. That is the main goal of increasing the block size AFAIK. 
Again: If you have 10% of the network, you will receive on average 2.5 BTC per extra block, and it currently costs ~.2 BTC to create a new high priority block. 12.5x return on investment. If you have 20% of the network the return would be 25x investment. This is currently happening on a massive scale, no one knows exactly how many of the blocks created on any given day are actually just major players ping ponging between wallets to create new blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-25 15:59:02
NO, not "empty blocks". Extra blocks created by sending actual amounts back and forth between wallets. Many wallets are used to get around the time limitations put in place to try to prevent this "Ping Ponging" to create extra blocks. By sending real transactions between different wallets that someone owns, they can create an extra block for a given time period. In the example I gave, if you have 10% of the network hashrate, you can recoup the tx fee transactions at a more than 10x return rate for every extra block created in a given time period. If you had 20% of the network hashpower, the return (again- on average) would be more like 25 times the amount spent on transaction fees for every extra block created.

Is Josh Garza now working for OKcoin? These tactics are 100% from his scam playbook.
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:21:18
I see no logic in your theory as it pertains to this case, but I would like to add that Josh Garza did in fact admit to sending himself death threats and blaming it on "the trolls" to make himself look like a victim. I don't recall the exact date, sometime around April or May I think, Josh came into one of the google video chats with TeamPaycoin using audio only, saying he was "driving". The prevailing theory was that he was still in Dubai at that time.

Homero Garza explains the Remember Hashlets:

LOL! You sir, win the Intertoobz for ™ minutes. Enjoy, my good man!
@_date: 2015-09-24 22:10:25
Interestingly enough, a scumbag involved with Paycoin and Garza who goes by "HellsGremlin" recently showed up in the big GAW/Garza thread on BCT  and posted some screens showing conversations with Josh Garza where he offers to "target those guys" and Garza AGREES and asks him what he needs. "Those guys" means the people posting in that thread who were and still are exposing Garza's fraud schemes.

Please explain "kind of known".  You either know or you do not.
@_date: 2015-09-25 01:06:24
I am sorry for trying to reason with you as that is obviously a wasted effort. Carry on with whatever scatterbrained "thoughts" you were having.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:34:58
Wrong. It is the OPPOSITE of that.  Merchants dump crypto as soon as they get it. This creates DOWNWARD pressure. Buyers create UPWARD pressure. You sound like a typical victim of Paycoin that simply does not understand how crypto currencies work.

How much off does the code Paycoined get?

Of course there is an SEC investigation of Cryptsy. You saying otherwise just makes it perfectly clear that you are ass covering liars.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:54:12
Fascinating tale, old chap! And you tell it so well. Why did you leave out the part about Paul Vernon and Josh Garza discussing in leaked Emails a stock swap to combine GAW and Cryptsy right before the launch of Paycoin? 
Edit to add: He is a link showing some of those Emails:

So you admit that I won it and you guys refused to make good. Nice welch job. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 11:53:01
Cryptsy is definitely involved in shady shit. That is why you are here tossing around obfuscations and outright lies.

As a kid we pulled the ol' wallet on a fishing line/ hide and yank it away when someone tries to grab it prank (lots of yuks), so I can see people assuming this is a prank.

No mention of the downward price pressure created by merchants continuously dumping BTC as they receive it. This is one of the things BTC price is struggling with right now as more large merchants start to accept BTC.  At some point having millions of consumers with wallets containing amounts in excess of what they spend (in essence millions of "micro-holders") will likely counteract this , but where that magic ratio of spend/hold to increase price is has yet to be determined.
