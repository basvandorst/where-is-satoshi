There is a legitimate point, but I think you overemphasize the rationality of most individuals. Many people keep money in banks simply because they haven't considered other options.


He can still save up using liquid investments, no? Is the overhead you mention accounting overhead, risk, or something else? I'd expect the non-optimality suffered by the individual to be rather small, and the positive externalities to be substantial.

He knew he wanted to have blocks every 10 minutes, and to start with 50 BTC rewards. He then decided he wanted the reward halving to occur roughly every 4 years, and 210,000 * 10 minutes = 3.99278 years. Because of the exponential decay in reward size, the total of all rewards in the first 4 years is the same as the the total of all rewards in the remaining years thereafter. Thus we get a total of 2 * 210,000 * 50 BTC = 21,000,000 BTC.
I expect that the size of the largest floating point integer determined the number of digits of precision in bitcoin, rather than the other way around, as suggests.

It is of course inevitable that an increase in investments will include an increase in bad investments, but most traditional investments have historically been profitable over the long term, and I would expect that trend to continue. If so, negative interest rates would still be a beneficial move.

This is because the recovery has been slow, not because a recovery has not happened. Indeed, quantitative easing is expected to [end in October](


No, [the first graph in the analysis I linked]( provides evidence that the E/P ratio is similarly explained by demographic shifts.


Sorry, I should have made my argument more explicit: for most of your metrics, demographic shifts have largely offset the recovery trend. After taking the effect of demographic shifts into account, we've made a substantial recovery toward where we expected to be right now.

But I expect popular support for a heavily restricted state to emerge long before support for any stateless solution. It may be the only viable option for some time.


Suppose though that the state forgoes any monopoly beyond its monopoly on monopoly-breaking. Would it then still be "the biggest, baddest, most dangerous monopoly"? If you believe that malice on the part of the state is inevitable, then I understand, but if it could be successfully limited, wouldn't it be better than a stateless society with unchecked monopolies?

Bonds, for example. I don't expect that there's an investment that's both riskless and liquid, which I imagine is the chief downside. This is also the reason that cash will never be completely replaced, but that is hardly necessary for the policy to have an effect.
A careful accounting of the upsides and downsides is admittedly beyond my qualifications, but I think it's clear that there *are* substantial positive effects. Money that is invested enters the hands of individuals for whom lack of funds is the only deterrent to positive economic activity. As far as I'm aware, it's well accepted that more investment is beneficial for society.

Your bitcoin address is not the public key, but rather a [SHA-256 hash (plus some extra)]( of the public key. Public-key cryptography is thought to be much more easily attacked than most other types of cryptography, whereas a preimage attack against SHA-256 is thought to be virtually impossible, and is what secures the blockchain itself.

I believe this is incorrect. If I'm not mistaken, this situation is equivalent to a [biased random walk]( with p = 0.9, and so if you try to undo even the most recent block, you would have only a (1 - p) / p = 1/9 chance of ever catching up.
However, if you are willing to pick a new block every so often (of the same age as the original block's original age), then yes, you would eventually overtake the chain on one of the attempts.

The cost to join the top 1% is so low for a few reasons:
* The BTC market cap is still quite small.
* A huge fraction of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of the top 0.01% rather than the top 1%. There are at least a couple people who each own about 5% of all bitcoins; compare Bill Gates, who owns only about 1/3000th of the world's wealth.
* The calculation of the 1% is based on the total number of bitcoin users rather than the full world population. If you are a bitcoin user at all, you are already in the top 0.02%.
People are complaining because it is upsetting that the world's wealth and bitcoin in particular are unevenly distributed. If life were fair, everybody would enter the world with exactly the same amount of wealth. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to achieve this. That said, it can be a bit upsetting when a new technological development appears to *worsen* inequality.

I understand that most people have a knee-jerk aversion to having money taken from them, but if you look past that, isn't it clearly beneficial?

I assume he means that if you had a ton of money, you'd want to be sure your computer was secure before handling it. However, I expect that if you had malware on your computer (and the wallet was unencrypted) the bitcoins would have been stolen already, so it's not a huge concern.

But 210000 seems at first to be an equally arbitrary number. It was chosen because 210000 * 10 minutes is very close to four years.
Also, I don't think that they decided on the block reward or halving interval so that the maximum number of satoshis would fit in double-precision floats, but rather they decided on those somewhat arbitrarily and then just allowed for as many digits of precision as would fit. That's why the maximum number of satoshis, roughly 2^(50.9), is only within about a factor of ten of the max precise double-precision float size, 2^(53), rather than closer.

I believe it's widely accepted that the decline in labor force participation rates is [due primarily to demographic factors]( (primarily baby boomers); it's indeed forecast to continue declining. The employment-population ratio is similarly misleading, and I expect that these same demographic factors have [understated the recovery]( [This analysis]( does a particularly good job of illustrating the role demographics play in E/P ratio stagnation.
I had trouble finding where ShadowStats gets its numbers in this case, but I know it has received a lot of criticism in the past. It certainly faces far less oversight than does the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Further, the allegation that the modification was meant to make unemployment look better is dubious: it caused a transparent, essentially constant offset up until the most recent recession. If deception was the intent, the officials certainly displayed considerable foresight in 1994.
The real median household income trend you linked is less hopeful than mine, though I'm not quite sure how to resolve the discrepancy. However, even if we use your data, the decline/stagnation is easily explained by the baby boomers. The trend in household income is very similar to the trend of the labor force participation rate.
Among middle class households, the home is usually one of the largest components of net worth, and given that housing prices underwent what is universally recognized as a [bubble]( I don't think the decline in median household net worth is so surprising or particularly ill-boding. And demographic changes are once again a factor as well, as the elderly do the most [dissaving](
The trend in small business ownership rate is hard to make out from the three data points provided, but while I'm sure the recession played a part in the recent decline, the growth of corporations could easily be the cause of the overall trend. I believe that the rate of small business ownership is least explicitly tied to economic well-being of all the metrics we've thus far discussed.


I had come across different versions of the metrics you discussed which I did not find alarming, and was hence asking whether there were other metrics or different versions that you found alarming. You've now provided them, and I agree that they at first appear disturbing, but I believe that analysis reveals they are much less awful than they seem.


The expectation that quantitative easing will bring hyperinflation is [simplistic and erroneous]( The monetary base has increased 4-5 times, and we have experienced minimal inflation. The sharp growth of the MB money supply is often trumpeted as some harbinger of doom when it is really nothing of the sort.


As you saw above, I dispute this. And even if I did not, it wouldn't mean quantitative easing measures were unsuccessful: they were intended to avert a crisis just as much as to contribute to a recovery.

Negative interest rates aren't intended for a time when there is an apparent bubble, but rather for after a bubble has burst, when prices are falling and most assets are considered "risky" purely because of fear in the market.
Outside of bubbles, most traditional assets are very safe, and the point of requirements to be an [accredited investor]( is to keep the uneducated from getting involved with riskier investments.

However, under normal circumstances, they stop lending out as the lending market's interest rate approaches zero. At that point, there is nothing to be gained from the excess reserves other than decreasing the interest rate paid until the excess reserves are withdrawn.


Sorry, by "matched the amount deposited" I meant "equaled the amount deposited * (1 - reserve ratio)".


Compare most mutual funds to an S&amp;P index fund, and you'll see that it does not take education to outperform supposed financial experts.


Interest rates would never be brought so low that all cash would be pulled from banks. The amount of cash kept in banks would decline slowly as the interest rate grew more negative, because cash still has the benefit of risklessness and liquidity, for which it is sometimes rational to pay a premium.

Negative interest rates would be used primarily when banks have large excess reserves (i.e., extra money that they're not lending out) so that the loss of lending money wouldn't be a problem. You'd simply lower interest rates until the amount being lent out matched the amount deposited, so that money wouldn't be just sitting around going to waste.

It is beneficial because it encourages them to move their assets elsewhere; they would very quickly move most of their wealth to assets safe from theft and more useful to society. They would suffer minimally.


Currency has enormous utility as a medium of exchange, but I don't see how this role would be appreciably undermined by negative interest rates.
Currency's utility as a store of wealth is significant, but it is inferior to traditional investments in this role, and thus *ought* to be undermined to some degree. Negative interest rates could be used to discourage use of currency as a store of wealth to a degree commensurate with its inferiority.


I don't think there's much evidence that the system is falling apart. We went through a scary period, but I think it's largely behind us now.

It's not a loss of wealth; it's a wealth transfer. I don't believe the broken window fallacy applies here. If the individual leaves most of their money in the bank, it is indeed a negative event for him, but it is an event that it is entirely within his power to avoid.
Pollution taxes, for example, are another "negative event" that leaves people on average better off. But even calling it a negative event is misleading; a pollution tax is a threat that sees minimal actualization.

From everything I have read, it appears that virtually no USB drives have either TRIM or idle-time garbage collection. Manufacturers would almost certainly advertise this if they did, and although it is hard to find someone saying that they *don't*, some people who seem to know what they are talking about indicate so [here]( 
As long as a casper-rw image involves no compression, I cannot imagine any reason that large portions would have to be rewritten. I assume that the drive should still be able to operate on the normal block size even within a file. So it still seems that the likelihood of the data still being there is quite high. 
That's a nice catch on the .info file. However, the time stamp of the backup it references is old: this suggests that the private key was (painfully) present well in advance of its use and deletion, and I speculate that this is in fact a *backup* of the .info file for that old wallet. I don't know by what mechanism or on what time frame these backups are produced, but they clearly are, and I don't see where they are securely deleted anywhere in the source code. (This also leaves the question of what happens to the actual wallet backups; they could somehow be securely deleted by [this]( otherwise I'm not quite sure.) The wallet and its backup were then updated ten days later, then securely deleted along with the normal .info file.

Examining lines 0000040 and 0000090, the private keys appear to be stored in the wallet prefixed with the bytes 01082012 and with every other byte reversed. The byte 20 presumably signifies the key length of 32 bytes. You should probably verify these patterns yourself, but searching through the whole .bin for the your WIF's hex key itself and for the hex key with every other byte switched should turn up the appropriate files if they are present. I expect that this will reveal at least one result. It will possibly only reveal the wallet you created on your second try (which according to your account should definitely still be present), which should not have the key of the address with your bitcoins. I would look over the wallet files quite exhaustively, possibly trying all 32-byte strings following near after the header of each wallet file. Developing a fuller understanding of how the wallet is supposed to be formatted (as mentioned in another comment) may reduce this burden somewhat, allowing you to become more easily certain of whether the key is present in the .bin. 
If you do not find the key in the .bin, there is still some hope. Read over [this paper]( when you get a chance; it discusses how files are stored in flash memory and what happens when they are nominally overwritten. My understanding is that flash memory cannot rewrite directly over a block without clearing it first completely, so usually new data is written in a different location, leaving stale copies of the files elsewhere, but where they cannot be revealed through software means. 
The authors of the paper describe a ~$1000 device for searching a flash drive, so examination of the stale data is evidently achievable, if difficult. You could even consider contacting the authors themselves and asking them about it. However, don't sink more money than you can afford into this; if it is what you decide to do, consider selling the 12 bitcoins to finance it, especially since there is still no guarantee that you will be able to retrieve them. Once again, though, the bitcoins will be there as long as the flash drive is kept safe. Anyway, if bitcoins keep going up in value, this sort of thing will become comparatively commonplace, and there is no need for you to be the trailblazer. 
Good luck.

Secure deletion of files has in fact been present since version 0.4.2, as mentioned [here]( so I do not expect the key to be available on the .bin. Fortunately, secure deletes on individual files are quite unreliable for flash memory, since each overwrite likely occurred in a new place on the drive and the original data was simply dereferenced. However, there is still no guarantee that the data is still present, and as far as I am aware, checking for the "stale" data cannot be achieved through software methods. I still encourage you to read the paper I mentioned at the end of my other comment. The paper cites a number of data recovery success rates, and after reading the text, it sounds as if the Gutmann percentage (70%) is likely most applicable. 
Edit: [It appears that the file is only overwritten once]( so the secure delete is considerably weaker than the Gutmann method. Furthermore, the file used in the paper was 1 GB in length, whereas the wallet file was extremely small. The only other chance of actual overwrite would be due to whatever else was written to the persistent storage, including the blockchain download and the web browser cache files and history. The nature of the persistent storage also matters: if the persistent storage includes more than just your home folder, there will also be the log files and caches; there is also the hope that updates to the persistent storage is not written until shutdown. But it is unlikely that more than several megabytes were written in any case, which is much less than the 35 GB of the Gutmann method (which does 35 overwrites) in the paper. The authors of the paper might have used a flash drive larger than yours, but it still looks as if there is a chance well over 90% that the key is still on the flash drive (even in the worst case that the drive was 1 GB).
