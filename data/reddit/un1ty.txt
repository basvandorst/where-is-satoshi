Ahh, you cant say the 'C' word here, mate.
Because censorship is only done in brutal dictatorships or are things of importance, not just general information (at least, thats what reddit apologists argue). Strawman all around!

Dang. That is pretty bad...
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:35:47
But isn't this EXACTLY why the voting system is even there in the first place?
"oh this is a repeatedly posted article - downvoted" = eventually the article loses enough points to not be seen. Why the dodgy 'auto-block' and apparent &lt;re: blatant&gt; removal on a whim attitude?
All it serves to do it feed the fires of 'conspiracy' in that reddit is compromised and every sub has some shitty agenda.

You mean if people were taught to critically think and thus learned to self-govern?
Its fucking reddit. Its LOL!
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:37:21
Yes. It's all censorship! Everything thats removed is CENSOREDEDEDED!
And if it weren't for the glorious mods, this place would be nothing by childporn, doxxing, and posts that would make Violentacrez humble.
Also, fuck you very much for your very dismissing and, well, honestly very Reddit-esque retort. You keep the faith in this site at an all time high!

Trolls, man. Trolls. Bring up a valid point, mention a word that no one likes and BAM! Trolled.
Not only that, but every comment I've made in this thread has at least  a -10 point value. Our little hyperbole filled troll fiend and his brigade are out to ensure that Funny remains "Mod approved funny."
After all, without the glorious Mods, there'd be doxxing and childporn EVERYWHERE, duh!
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:37:41
Well, you and obviously know what needs to be in so you should become mods and start removing posts that you, yourself, do not find funny. I mean, that's the point of the sub right? It rightfully should be called "@_date: 2014-04-15 13:31:54
LOL - thanks! 
I think at this point, its rain drops in the ocean. I think that the previous comment of mine to is my single most downvoted of all time - something to be proud of! :)

Agreed - the whole incident could have been handled better, on both sides, but that doesn't negate the startling lack of apparent security in this chat.
However, we only are seeing what appears to be the end of this chat. Did you ever log in or supply credentials, at all, during the entire session?
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:58:49
Meh, its not your fault. All one has to do is state either an unpopular *opinion* and thats it. I never cared for the points anyway, TBH, so .. whatever. :D

Yes, because PayPal is a bastion of freedom and privacy.
