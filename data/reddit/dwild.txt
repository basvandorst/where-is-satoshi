I'm still noob so excuse me if I'm wrong but can you really afford to lose in that kind of attack? 
It's a pool, people can change to another pool and if we can detect theses kinds of attack, then people will be aware of what GHash.IO is doing and will move to another pool.

They got millions taken by the US government. They lost money there. I don't know more about that story but I guess they probably tried to get it back, which involve costly lawyers... 
This only cover the money part, everyone know that and OP acknowledge it himself that it's fine. However in this situation what's missing is Bitcoin, which is worse because like you said, the exchange shouldn't take from theirs customers. This is what OP was trying to solve here... considering they needed money, anything is possible. Time to get Bitcoins out of the cold storage can be the problem but I think they would do everything they can to do it faster to keep the trust of their customers.

Advertisement and more customers.
Some casino in Las Vegas has some really cheap hotel room, simply because if you sleep there, you will probably play there. 
You mine there, you could also buy some GH/s while you have some Bitcoin there, it's not like you would lose anything from it... you will resell them later, maybe for even more! (that's the minding they hope people follow, in the end, CEX are the winners).

What's wrong with having similar fees to credit card? 
For me Bitcoin was always a way to decentralize the middle men, not a way to reduce or remove the fee.

Bitcoin pool are cheap but hotel room are not, got it?
The cost for them is minimal and if it bring more customer (which it does considering they can reach theses kinds of production) then it will cover the cost easily. It's all about being where the miners go.
We are talking about them right now because they are literally too big. That strategy made them too big for Bitcoin. If their goal was to advertise CEX and try to sell cloud mining to miners (which is not too far from their target market) then they exceeded their expectation.

Good question, I don't know because I don't have anything to mine but I did owned some GH/s and the Bitcoin balance was both on GHash.IO and CEX, so I guess it was the same. You also had altcoin balance on CEX, that you can't actually mine on CEX (but you can on GHash.IO) so I believe it's shared.

I'm not talking about result, I'm talking about the chance to carry it.
If they don't succeed in their attack, we will know it and people will move to another pool, which will lower their hashing power and will give them even less chance of succeeding.

People will use the one the most available, which will be the one with the premium fees.
One of the reasons is that more cash you have, better the service will be. 1 hour to confirm a bitcoin transaction? What about a 1 second transaction through JPMorgan?
Another one is the marketing, how much bad press Bitcoin has? I doubt the alternative from JPMorgan will have that much bad press.
Linux is free, Windows is not.

This one?
The cheapest option was £50 + £10 for 3, which is 33$ each, it's not bad for what it is.

It means that increase in the price of Bitcoin are caused by companies. If they were not there, you wouldn't be able to use your Bitcoin. It's because theses companies decided to invest time and money into Bitcoin that you can now use it that much and it has this value.
Bitcoin can be potentially sold anywhere it's worth enough and it's not everywhere. I can't use it here in Quebec, I can barely get some.
Bitcoin pocket are those of the people adopting it. This is exactly what I said, I thought I was clear enough, sorry. Theses pockets are worth at best 10$ Billion currently. JPMorgan have 2.5$ TRILLION in assets. If they decided to offer an alternative currency to their client, it would be worth 2.5$ trillion, 250 times what Bitcoin worth. This doesn't include how much they are ready to invest in that alternative currency. Even if they only invest a minimum of money, they already have 16 100 ATM worldwide, they have 5 100 physical locations worldwide. 
This is what make the difference, how much time it will take before companies are ready to invest that much into Bitcoin?
All that being said, I have nothing agaisn't Bitcoin, it's an amazing currency, however it still far from being secure in its positions agaisn't a giant like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. All we can hope is that they will be too late... but they are not too late currently.

Which head start? A couple of big web store and a bunch of small indie store?
You know what JPMorgan could have? Paypal, Ebay, or Amazon, etc... 
Now an head start also need users, how much users does Bitcoin have? How much user does JPMorgan have? Yeah..
What about physical distribution? How much ATM does Bitcoin have? How much ATM does JPMorgan have? Yeah...
They also have monetary advantage to Bitcoin, how much commercial investment there's in Bitcoin, not much... 
JPMorgan has a big headstart. You don't need a product to have a big headstart.

So what? Visa, Mastercard, American Express are all American companies...
Bitcoin is worldwide? Seriously? Then BTChina are not responsible for that huge increase in the value of Bitcoin? Weird
Bitcoin is only where a company actually want to sell it, which is not everywhere and not at the same easiness. There's nobody that actually control or help Bitcoin to develop except us and we don't actually put that much on it, in fact, we can't say that we would put more than 10 billions on Bitcoin currently, it's what it worth right now. 
The alternative money from JPMorgan will be available where they will want it to be and if they want to maximize theirs profits (and believe me, they do), it will be everywhere. This is the huge difference. They have deeper pocket than the entire Bitcoin network, this is worth more than you believe.

Where do you buy an OLED of that size for that price?

A 50$ android phone on dx.com and you put your wallet there. A color touch screen with wifi! It's much better than this thing!
I know it much bigger too but I think it show that it's overpriced, a little arm processor cost nearly nothing. Personnaly I think 60$ is more resonable, however I think 1 btc is not too much to have one of the first one.

Really? Where's my bitcoin? How can I get them? Yeah I forgot, I need to have an account with X websiteand then do Y thing to transfer it to my Z wallet...

0 Bitcoin = no Bitcoin
Having the software doesn't give you Bitcoin.

It's more secure because there's less point of failure. It does only one things. If you do only one thing with the android phone (a transaction) it's the same.
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:16:54
I would still trust this device more than an Android phone because it's made for this purpose. However it shouldn't cost that much more.

The alternative coin from JPMorgan would be bundled with most of their bank account too, that's something.
Cash bring capacities... the capacity to be bundled with most computer sold is one of them.

Because now he have 120$ and you still believe him.

Exactly, there's no easy way.
Your solution won't let me mine more... except if you give more Bitcoin per block (which will never happen, for multiple reasons), even if you give 10 block, with 2.5 bitcoins each, at the end of the day, the same number of bitcoin will be mined and the same number of bitcoin will be given to the same number of miner. Even increasing Bitcoin per block would be a temporary solution, more miner will come back and it will balance again to the same difficulty.
