I'm thinking it terms of the content creators. I use adblock but sometimes I feel bad because I only ever turn it off every once in a while to support channels I like. If I could bitcoin tip then I wouldn't have to feel bad about blocking their commercials.

Most servers choose to ignore seat counts. It's more work for no benefit, so the whole tables food is put on one seat lol. Can you imagine bringing out like 7 people's worth of food and putting it all in front of one person lol

I don't get it. Are people putting links to pictures in the fake address, or is the whole picture encoded across many addresses?

Not to necrobump, but what if he required the clients to purchase his product in bitcoin?

Honest question. Even if we could somehow definitively prove that there is foul play, what difference would it make? Even if they publicly confessed, what action would be taken?

And when a woman speaks up about why she doesn't speak up (or advertises that she is a woman when she does post) she is mocked and told she is wrong. 
they've been interacting with women all this time, and their bias makes them assume when not otherwise stated, the person on the other end of the line is a man; she never brings up the fact shes a woman lest she be harassed, and thus perpetuates this perception that women don't like crypto. So...
I am a woman. I like crypto. Hopefully that dispels at least one person's misconceptions.

Because white people also experience hardship, racism against black people does not exist. 


I more or less said the same thing, but it's important to understand that underrepresented people are disproportionately affected by "general assholery"

The question was posed why more women don't like crypto, then a bunch of people chimed in portraying women negatively, either gold digging, slut shaming, or just plain unintelligent. Is the irony lost on you? Perhaps women don't want to engage with communities that don't treat them like actual people. It's not SJW, NPC or group think bullshit, it's just wondering why the world works the way it does, making observations, and following them to their logical conclusions. Now you may say they were jokes and that could very well be true, but the point still stands. Maybe women don't want to engage with a community that makes negative jokes about them, even if they are "just jokes." 
jokes can be used to mask harmful sentiments that are indeed inwardly held by those making them (or those laughing at them); because you have no way to tell if it's all in good fun or if they're just using humor as an excuse to say what they really think, it's easier to just not engage. For the record, I'm not calling out crypto spaces as specifically misogynistic in that it treats women badly. I think it's full of toxicity in general and one way that manifests is that people are disproportionately toxic towards women because it easily stacks with existing stereotypes about women in technology; not to mention, most of the crypto scene exists online, and the internet tends toward treating women poorly.

I wonder if it's the toxic community's rampant misogyny that you can see in this very thread. Surely not...

I’m confused I thought it was a joke? You sent your entire holdings, 8 dollars? And paid 6 dollars in fees?

I'm not saying it must be 50/50. I'm saying the women who are here should be respected, acknowledged, and the women who aren't shouldn't be portrayed as *ahem* "basic bitches"

That's essentially making the same argument that since Obama became president racism is over. It's not about whether one individual that defies the general rule can earn respect, it's about how women in general are portrayed, and treated. Just look up in this thread : implications that women date men so she can steal *his* money. Implications that women aren't smart enough for tech etc. It's not whether or not Elizabeth stark is respected (Although you'll find plenty of examples of disrespect about her and other women in the community), it's the faceless, nameless woman that is considered an idiot or slut until first proven otherwise.

But with increase in economic value (GDP) it's not printing new money for the same amount of stuff (decreasing purchasing power). They've been printing pretty aggressively and they're still having a hard time hitting their inflation targets. The Fed actually wants higher inflation than what they've achieved over the last 10-15 years.

Then youd have to accumulate a crapload of millisatoshis to matter... Basically you could only ever use them to also pay others milli sats

I get how you can subdivide more cause it's just a ledger but How does that settle up when you close a channel?

I really would prefer to actually use bitcoin for it's intrinsic purpose i.e. to buy stuff. I bought some now because I think eventually it will start to catch on and I'll be able to buy a computer or something with it. That being said, I'm not currently satisfied with the option for merchants. Also, if I want to easily convert it back to USD I'd like the option to.

Yeah that's what stinks. I bought my Bitcoin at market value a couple days ago but I don't even have access to it till next Wednesday. So during this crash I've just sat there and been like... there's nothing I can do about it anyway haha.
Edit: If there is a situation where you have to wait a couple days, is it possible for the system to automatically purchase the BTC at market value when the transaction actually occurs?
