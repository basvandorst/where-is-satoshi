It's purely optional. On the exchanges you can generate keys with read-only access access to your portfolio data. We only added support for it based off reddit comments asking for the convenience of not having to copy in investment conditions every time you place a new trade.

If it increases than prob will reach 17k else it could either hover around 16k or drop to 15k again.

Just sell the amount of coin you bought for $300. It doesn't matter which coin is being sold, just make sure that you can out the exact amount. It makes no difference to profits.

At this point theres no point in using Kraken. It's nearly impossible to deposit/withdraw at times and the trading is so buggy that even if it tells you it failed it actually still processes, ending up buying/selling more coins than you wanted.

Bitfinex is really nice. Just send the Ethereum over and exchange it to Iota. Would be better to exchange it to USD first than to Iota if your bothered.

Best to get a hardware wallet if you plan to store them for that long and better as a physical Christmas present. Look for  Ledger Nano S and find a tutorial on how to transfer you coins to it.

Thanks man, really appreciate your feedback. Sync between devices is already provided as you login through your email. Will integrate Google login and other social logins this week. The rest are also planned to be implemented.

I can look into that. Don't exactly have a budget right now but can always airdrop low priced coins and make make sure they have real use cases.

This is a android app that make management and tracking of your cryptocurrency assets stored on exchanges easy and simple. With a planed social platform which strives to solve the lack of trust in the cryptocurrency market by providing a way for users to garner the veracity of other users comments and posts by interlinking their portfolio to their social profile. Not exactly a coin and have no plans for a ICO.

If not, tell me what you liked and disliked. Just the start for the app and have plenty of room to improve.

All prices in the app are converted to USD. Will add an option to allow users to change their default currency and also in case of the track tab will also allow prices in the native trading pair. I believe it will be easier for users to track prices in one currency but while also keeping the accuracy of each trading pair. Hopefully will get your request done soon.
