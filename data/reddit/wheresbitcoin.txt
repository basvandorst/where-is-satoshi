First, it's not a fraction. An example: how much capital did Winklevii put into bitcoin? 1/1000th of the market value of their coins. How much did Satoshi put in? The total entered is no where near $500 Billion. Second thing, I didn't have anything to do with Mt Gox or their willy bot pumping the price but it still walloped my bitcoins when it collapsed.

ANd to those who keep downplaying how big this is, look how intertwined USDT is into so many big exchanges
Top 3 in volume. So many market participants are forced to use it because they can't use real USD. the markets are FUKKKED if this thing blows up. You have to literally have 0 understanding of economics to think this is no big deal.

When bitfinex /Tether go down, which I suspect is coming soon, customers will send their high value coins out of most exchanges and into USD exchanges to cash out. it's going to dry up like 90% of the liquidity at many of the USDT exchanges (which there are a ton of them). When that happens they no longer have an exchange anymore (or at least not a profitable one). Many exchange owners will *cough cough*, "lose", or have lost their clients coins through a hack of some sort and disappear in the night. They would be selling them before Tether/Finex actually go down.

We don't really need an audit when Tether themselves says the token is not backed by real USD.

What people fail to realize is market cap is bogus with cryptos. $2Bil represents a much much larger percentage of actual capital &amp; liquidity in the system. I don't know the exact figure but I would estimate in the $10-$20 Billion range. So it's more like 10-20% 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:50:22
serious question: what if the price drops 20% by the closing, who gets stuck with the loss? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:07:53
Just been around the block a couple of times and understand the extent of the greed in this cryptoworld. I lucked out with Mt Gox but lost some in a couple other exchanges , cryptsy being one of them. This time around is going to be like 10 or 20 mini Mt Goxes at the same time, plus whatever happens with finex 
all my opinion of course
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:38:18
I know 2 facts: it's not anywhere near $500 Billion, and Tether does not have anywhere near $2.25Billion to back up USDT. Sometimes you have to make reasonable estimates -  5-7 million coins in true circulation x average $2500 per coin invested sound fair? = $10-$20 Billion.

$400 or miner breakeven at under $1k price range. Bitcoin will tax sell into EOY &amp; profit taking through Jan. Then will die again at some point in 2018.

That cost to mine can go very low, close to free. I hope people are aware of this. Again, there is nothing rare about this anymore. Gold and precious metals are rare, for sure. That doesn't mean they should be worth what some people think either. Gold is stuck at $1200-$1300 for a reason, as is silver around $16. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:17:00
It can still exist and function and be virtually free to acquire. I mean, it still worked fine when it cost a penny, didn't it?

For what? I am pretty low-key. Don't do anything shady or anything like that. The only thing I could think if not the employment info is someone was trying to access my account from another computer...would that cause it to get blacklisted?
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:20:53
I am not a troll. I lost access to my old reddit account. I have nothing against CB, in fact, I endorse/d them to many people. I enjoyed their service while it was available. And no, I have not done anything illegal with them.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:24:08
No, and no.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:18:45
It's funny that nearly every response is guessing what I must've done wrong..seriously, are there Coinbase employees here?
All I did on CB was trade on their exchange and buy/sell through their brokerage - that's it. I researched them a little more and found some really troubling stories right here on reddit. I would've never taken a closer look if this didn't happen to my account. Also their CS is a total disaster (4 days to receive a canned response, have to follow up, multiple CS reps sending different replies to the same email). Maybe this was a blessing in disguise...

I didn't see any warnings. Researching this a little further I am finding that this is a common issue. Something to do with employment information entered at signup. I don't even recall them asking for this years ago, but if it was something like that why wouldn't they just tell me. I've never seen a company (in any sector) restrict someone without at least some explanation. Seems really strange.

Why does it take so long for the difficulty to adjust? If I understand this correctly, the difficulty determines how much miners are making to mine the coin. So BCH is more profitable right now, miners move there, but when difficulty increases there (when is that?) then they'll jump back into mining BTC? What if we crash below BCH?

Luke Jr's post was dismissed a few replies down. The reasoning it would destroy Bitcoin

This is horrible for Bitcoin, I don't care what anyone says. Look what happened to online poker after the US quasi-banned it. China is too big a player in cryptos to dismiss this. Not dead, but Bitcoin is not going to be the same.

They could sell millions of bitcoins and go back in time and erase all those sales from the blockchain. Rinse &amp; repeat down to $1. You know there will be probably a few hundred billion dollars chasing it all the way down before reality sets in. That's not very likely but it's possible with total control of the miners.

* 1st mover advantage
* liquidity
* network effect
* will most likely be a winner takes all scenario
Think about this for a minute: if you're a business looking to expand into alt coins (or decide to save in and use bitcoin as a consumer), what benefit would you get from using a coin that is inferior in regards to the advantages listed above?  NONE
Would you use an alt coin over bitcoin because you perceive the price of bitcoin to be too high or too risky? The fallacy of this argument is that the exact opposite is true. In reality, the price of the coin being used is irrelevant. The coin that businesses and consumers will gravitate to is the one with the most liquidity, most ubiquitous, and the largest (and safest) network.
This is why bitcoin has never relinquished its huge lead. Basic economics and human psychology.   
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:03:45
definitely speculation, but if they allow you to spend bitcoin at casinos and other gaming, that could be huge.
