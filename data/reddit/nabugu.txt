YOU SEE, EVEN THE DIP IS ABOVE $10,000 NOW
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:29:47
Yes, and it's also optional for people to go out of exchanges that don't give a shit about their customers. If they don't get in Segwit, I get out of them. Optional too.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:51:29
Yes, this is precisely the value : that other people will want what you have in the future for a higher price (same with pieces of art, an apartment in a crowded city, gold, etc...)

I think the best thing is to go to their slack,
 there's a bunch of lightning devs who are getting feedback there,
working on bugs and all that (
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:22
Just zoom out on your mempool chart. The current level is not that exceptional. It may go down like it did in the past (look at the current year variations for example).
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:53:08
Sorry to return to reality, but do you think this will definitely create a dip when the amount is converted ? What do you think ?
5000 bitcoins is not that common to sell, no ?

@_date: 2017-12-23 06:25:35
I think it’s because Bitcoin Core is open source. If you make a “binding” roadmap on day 1, someone totally new may come in day 2 and propose something new, adding or replacing what someone else proposed as the original roadmap. Also, as no one is paid for contributing/rewiewing to Bitcoin Core, it would hardly be really binding to anyone. 
But maybe “smaller” groups of devs like the one working in Blockstream or Lightning Labs could have done their own private roadmap related to the objectives of their company. Just my look into it though.

I mean, you really think all the offshore assets in this world will trust a coin which is controlled by some Chinese miners who have the freaking Chinese communist government behind their back ? Seriously.

I heard about some video on YouTube which is talking about switching a Lightning node into mainnet, I didn’t see it myself so I imagine it could be quite technical.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:31:47
I already started to orientate my relatives towards Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:40:06
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:35:47
It’s because lightning devs are working to make the Network as secure as it can be. These guys are professionals, they won’t release the mainnet until it’s very safe to use.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:26:52
It’s not just about money, it’s about legitimacy and decentralization. All the Btrash guys have literally zero legitimacy. They just copy-pasted years of solid Core Dev code, which has been proven to be strong and now these guys want control over Bitcoin. Moreover their solution will generate node centralization, and with centralization it will fall by itself through state intervention. Core devs are really high skilled guys who know what they’re doing for years now. If you want to go the Visa/MasterCard way, go on, but I won’t because it’s not why I entered this space.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:20:02
It’s actually better, Bitcoin is an accumulator of value.

That's so true omg. Bitcoin is becoming more titanium each crash it goes through.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:09:37
Yes, I think that the last couple of months have proven that Bitcoin is tougher that it may seem to external actors. Everyone now is like "buy the diiiiip it will get higher again". Every crash proves that a 15-25% down price is not that bad lol. It is quite impressive after all.

Do you really think that the Federal Reserve would return to a system that restrained itself from printing more and more money ?
At the times of the Gold Standard, the US government could not print all the money they want because this money could be exchanged for gold that the Fed should have in its safes. This was a very responsible system. 
I doubt the current generation of central banks would return to such a system. Unfortunately, pillaging people's purchasing power by inflation is way too advantageous for them.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:19:32
But maybe an expansive Bitcoin can also generate some sort of admiration and respect because it has become a "big thing".

lol actually yes it is an immutable law of human markets. Trees don’t grow to the sky in one go, even a bull market does need some significant pullbacks.
We’re not there yet, but we’ll see with this one if we can go back to a long term bull market with a higher low.

I went to Plato’s cave, and he fucked me quite hard, so I know some ass shit honey
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:37:01
No that’s not just my opinion. A bull market needs some higher lows to be established and considered a clear trend. We don’t have that now, but we might get it with this drop.

@_date: 2017-05-21 09:30:51
Literally no one can advise you on that at this time scale. Maybe monday some big exchange will have a DDos attack and the price will dip, maybe all will be fine and the price will continue upwards. It's a bet. But in the long term (years), I think you should buy.
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:57:15
I'm sure two years ago you would have said exactly the same.

You all understand that Vitalik Buterin is literally doing more or less the same job right ? I mean, building a platform where some legal and ILLEGAL transactions can happen without censorship.

Think of Bitcoin as a digital gold. People don't use gold any more to pay their beers, but it still has a high value. Spending it is not as crucial as people usually think.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:43:24
We need to never forget that today some computer scientists can retrieve with stats and big data the most probable location and objects of your Bitcoin transactions because the network is so transparent, even with mixing/tumbling.
The IRS agencies all around the world have already begun to investigate in that sort of analysis. If you obtained your coins with a regulated exchange platform you can be even more easily identified if needed.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:44:10
Does the fact that some blocks are not full is related to the fact that they were mined very closely in time to those which precede them ? ��

Eat potatoes instead of ramen. Potatoes have all the nutrients you body needs (when baked but not fried of course). Several people have been living eating only potatoes for months without nutrient deficiencies.
