depends on the provider. Here in Austria, Vienna I have a contract with UPC(liberty global), cable 300/30 Mbit, flatrate.  already several terabytes uploaded just from DGB and BTC nodes  :))

Oh my...First thing I saw,  was a vending  machine (looks like a big fridge...) and I was like "hmmm, what are they selling"  :)    Then I read about the decal and realised it's a PC.. -.-

Interface on mobile devices hopefully gets improved? (android 7.0 here, all I describe below, works PERFECTLY within gdax mobile site, so no, it's not my phone)
as of now, all coin values are shortened with "...". 
instead of a big touchable area in the upper left corner, where the dropdown coins list appears in gdax, you now have to tap on the tiny arrow, not wider than 3-4 mm on my screen (Note 5). The text label, I.e. "ETH/USD" is NOT touchable anymore... 
Limits section does not load anything. 
The height of both sell and buy buttons got reduced.
choose any period in "line" view, wait for the screen to draw the chart, tap again on the period area, it does not do anything anymore. Stuck with i.e. 6 hours view.
The height of the area with the new coinbase pro logo is bigger than on gdax. same goes for the coins selection area, resulting in smaller chart/orderbook visualisation due to less space.
"book": 6 sell and 6 buy entries in CB pro vs. 9 + 9 in gdax
Am I the only one with these problems?
reminds me of the glorious work of our highly skilled offshore developers in our company, who get nothing done properly in time, give a f..k about end to end tests and then have to work double the time to iron out the bugs :))

that´s normal in Vienna. I changed both electricity and gas provider last year, so it should be a little lower now, but still around 0.2 € /kwH. I started mining a few months ago and the kw/h price is independent from how much I draw, no "night" tariff i.e.

wow...20 € cent in Austria o.O. (total gross amount/kwH)
