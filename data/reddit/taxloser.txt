Hm interesting that this article mentions the number of users of Coinbase, which is by far the easiest way for an average user to get into bitcoin in the US.  Benchmarking the potential price of bitcoin against new users is something i've never thought of, but this article peaks my interest. Time for some napkin math. 
If we assume that the addition of 100K coinbase users was a big driver of the recent rally from ~$8,200 to ~8,900.  Lets say 60% of the rally was from "new money" - that means 100k users drove $420 of the price rally, or $0.0042 per new user.  Per the article, Coinbase has a total user base of 13.1 million, or 4% of the US population.  Assuming news and evangelism of crypto continues to increase, it would be reasonable to expect coinbase to be able to double their userbase to 8% of the US population by the end of 2018.  That would be an additional 13.1 million users added.  If each 'new money' user drives $0.0042 in price increase. 13.1M extra users would therefore be an additional $55,020 added to the price of bitcoin.  But lets say these new users onboard at a slower rate and don't drive as much value as this rally.  Lets say each sign up only drives half the value of this rally, at $0.0021 per new user.  That would drive an additional $27,510 to the price of bitcoin by the end of next year for a bitcoin price of ~$36,500.
Wild estimate, and gross assumptions yes.  But definitely fun to think about :)

Fair points.  
On your first point I'd say the first 13.1 didnt do the same thing as they were slowly added over 5 years, so it had the lack of momentum of money coming in at the same time and driving up price. Coinbase's user base is now growing exponentially, and I was assuming they will add 13.1 over 1 year, whcih would mean any rally is magnified by potential 100's K new users per day throwing money into BTC vs 1k.
Second point definitely valid, I don't really have any solid argument against it,  except going back to the 1st point that each new user will have less of an effect, but you will have exponentially more users buying at the same time which can push market cap with momentum.
Obviously the model ignores a million other factors, especially since the US market is only one sliver of the pie.  More of a fun 'what if' thing to think about than an accurate model.

How are you tracking new users?  Tried to find these stats on Coinbase's website but couldnt find anything.
