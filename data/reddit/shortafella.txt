Hi there. This is not a good time to buy 10 bucks worth of bitcoin since it's fluctuating a lot. Tons of transactions and big fees. What you can do though is invest in the second great coin which is Ethereum. Faster and way cheaper transactions straight from dollars to coin. It went up pretty well recently and looks like it has a good future ahead. Hope this helps. Good luck.

Relax. Nothing happened. If it goes below 7k (wishful thinking) - you should get more. Time will tell why.

real men are made of blood bones and flesh and breathe. real men lie, cheat, are fair, are right, are wrong, fail or improve themselves. any woman would not leave any man. being a zombie or a robot (call it what you will) is boring. peace!

Merry Christmas! Bitcoin goes up again as I type. Anyhow, if she left you for this, it can only be for the better. That's not what marriage is all about, man:) Leaving when shit happens? Anyone can do this. The world is yours, dude + you only live once. Open them eyes and enjoy the ride.
