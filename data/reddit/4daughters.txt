I think you need to tell us the difference because neither Merriam, Webster, nor I know what it is in this context.

Right, and that "value" is subjective and based on societal agreements. Not anything physical or intrinsic to the substance itself. 
The point is most of the value of gold is not intrinsic, although it certainly does contain intrinsic value.

Gold isn't any better at being money than paper. Rarely does anyone use gold to purchase goods or services. I wouldn't be surprised if more transactions (either by total value or sheer number) were conducted with bitcoin than gold.
That being said gold *is* good at being valuable, which makes it a good place to store value. But that value isn't based on it being a useful currency. It's more accurate to say its value is based on it being a good money *in the past* than anything it can do right now.

It's a worse conducter than silver or copper but slightly better than aluminum. It's used in electronics often due to the stability of the metal (doesn't corrode). It's also extremely ductile which is probably why it's used in other specialized cases as well. Not sure about why it's used in visors, maybe because it acts as a good radiation shield even in small quantities? 
It's definitely valuable as a material, but it would unquestionably be much cheaper if people didn't historically use it as currency and hoard it.

I thought this is what the free market looked like.

Probably, but no worse than picking someone at random from Wall Street. 
No one knows where this is headed.
