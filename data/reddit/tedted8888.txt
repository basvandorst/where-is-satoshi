Um the gov't killed the liberty dollar. Why is this any diffrent?  Do they not risk the gov't forcefully shutting them down?  How is this legal?  Do they just make round pieces of metal with a custom logo which just happen to be silver or gold?

If their highly leveraged, taxing them will put them out of business and hurt their investers, which could be regular people mind you.  Is your intent to stop highly leveraged entities by taxing to death or do you just feel that rich people should be punished?

What happens when 85% of the bitcoin is mined and cooperations start managing the blockchain?  What happens if quazi-gov't cooperations start hosting for bit coin?  Have you ever read the paper?  This is specifically pointed out that the integrity of bitcoin is that the majority of the servers are independent, like napster back in the day.

Yes, but then they have discriminatory power.  Granted it wont be much, but as I understand, increasing the block size would be very beneficial but it wont happen because the Chinese miners have to much invested in the current system.  If gov't ever controls the blockchain or has &gt;51% of the computing power, Im selling all my coins.

Don't about 7 to 10 Chinese mining operations essentially control the blockchain?  I think she knows exactly what she's doing.  A publicly funded mining operation on order of the nsa would effectively contol the blockchain and destroy the currencies independence it was designed to provide.

Are liberals that better?  Just wait until they learn what a bitcoin is. That is if they ever move past guns and gay super rights.  Bitcoin will be the new currency of the privlaged.

Or like saying we will ban all guns because then bad guys cant get them!
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:25:29
and liberals would do any better?  Sorry I'm a one issue voter, which is gun rights.

The could start charging fees no?  I mean what happens when there are no more bitcoins to mine?  The network will be supported by fee miners.

Paper wallet?  Like print out your private key and store it in a secret place

Regan ran on eliminating the department of education.  Doubt Paul would do much more than Regan (basically all talk).  Think of the USA as the Titanic and the president as the captin. If we change captins does the Titanic still sink after she struck the iceburg? 
However the most important thing the next election will do will be a pointing supreme court judges.  I think 2-3 are in their 80s

How does a bitcoin become tainted?  After its confirmed twice isn't it like 85% legit. After it's confirmed 6 times isn't it 99.95 legit?  Or are u saying the gov't is going to not accept certain transactions which can be linked to certain adresses?  How would the gov't know a transaction came from xyz adress?  Are they really going to search a merchants transactions on the blockchain?

I am new. Is there an faq or something?  I thought the reason the Mt gox  guys never got caught was because they distributed the coins between 10 accounts which then transfered to 10 different accounts etc.  If that can't be tracked how do u expect the gov't to track xyz address on the blockchain?
