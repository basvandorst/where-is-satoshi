Unfortunately it isn't that easy since in the case of fraud i.e. stolen credit card the chargeback can't be reversed. Also I'm pretty sure you can't reverse a chargeback on digital goods (at least Paypal, Amazon and Google payment gateways for merchants don't allow chargeback reversals on digital goods from what I remember).

Ok thanks for the clarification. I still wonder how well you could dispute a chargeback with one of the credit card companies by just providing the transaction history. I have a feeling that they won't be helpful about it.

Just as a follow up I found this blog post about someones experience disputing chargebacks with digital goods. Couple of interesting points.


By tracking number we mean a USPS, UPS, or Fedex tracking number in the US (or other carriers internationally). By proof of delivery we mean “signature required” where the person who ordered the product actually signed for the delivery. Letting UPS leave it on the doorstep without a signature doesn’t count for proof of delivery- “The neighborhood kids must have stolen it! I didn’t get it!” works for a dispute.








Interesting tipbit that you can send a digital good to get around the issue. I wonder if that could work where you post out a paper wallet with the funds to the buyer. That way you are protected somewhat from chargeback fraud and will have proof of delivery. However that would be a bit expensive I imagine.
