Honestly, picking the right people to trade with is very difficult since you have so many using VPNs and lying about their country and ownership. I wish Paxful would make you register a bank account to use for Zelle transactions that way you're vetted before they let you use it. Or use PLAID to make sure you're the owner. There's a million ways to eliminate scammers and they make little attempt to protect the seller.

\ Problem with Paxful is when you try to do a trade and the buyer IGNORES the instructions and trade description and Paxful says, "Oh there's nothing you can do about it once they claim to have paid." Um...yeah there is. When i check and they didn't pay and didn't follow instructions, the Admins should give them a warning or ban them for abusing trades. I wrote the instructions to protect myself and Paxful won't back me? Dude, as a seller, if I don't come here with coin to sell, you have no business to operate. I shouldn't have to wait 10 days for a Moderator who comes in and says, "Oh you can't ask them to cancel when they paid." Um...no. They didn't pay. I have proof. 
\ Problem with Paxful is you can't be a verified user without a certain rating (% of successful trades). Problem is, NO ONE reads Trade Descriptions or Instructions so you get guys that open trades and cancel for no reason, open trades and ask you for a way to pay (zellle email or something) and then they don't send the payment, they cancel the trade. Sooooooo many of these ruining your rating and Paxful does nothing to fix this. If you open a trade and cancel or it times out, YOU should get a negative rating for wasting a vendor's time and resources, YOU locked the coin up and YOU made the mistake. If you're not ready, don't trade. Easy.
