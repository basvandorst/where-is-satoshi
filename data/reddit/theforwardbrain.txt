In a possibility of impending recession, institutions are still investing into btc, quite notably in 2019, what does it say for them and their outlook?
I know no individuals buying btc in 2018-2019, so btc confidence could hv shifted from individuals into institutions.

What you have effectively said was that you prefer to have less freedom because you are worried of that freedom because you cannot make educated decisions and that you cannot bear the consequences of your decision making, so you are willing to relinquish all of that. 
There is a reason why bitcoin exists. People want way more autonomy today, they are better educated, believe in winners/losers so they believe they are in control of their destiny. It is in the totality of a bitcoin transaction that lies the value of bitcoin, it is beautiful, simple, pure, non corrupted. 
What you want is to make better educated decision, focus on that.

Bitcoin is a new asset class that is more closely related with a store of value like gold.
If however, we compare bitcoin to stocks, look at Apple, they are 800-900bil mcap, but their daily volume is below 10mil. Many 10-200bil mcap companies trade below 1mil daily volume. Bitcoin is at 14-15bil daily volume, minus wash trading it is still at around 10bil volume which is astronomically bigger than stocks even though it sits at 150bil mcap.
US total market for gold is maybe around 7-8trillion and daily volume around 200-250bil. Based on those numbers you can tell that bitcoin is traded a lot in comparison to the mcap and ratio of gold trading. Good news for bitcoin basically.
PS: do take note that the true circulating supply of btc is going to be less than the advertised circulating supply as well due to lost btc. The amount lost is quite significant and therefore bitcoin true mcap can be below 100bil. Low mcap with high daily volume are good indicators of high interest in bitcoin.

First time see this argument. A good argument as well. What you are saying is gold and fiat intrinsically cannot scale and in a world without 3rd party, can you imagine carrying a load of cash everywhere and only paying for items in person and never online. To store fiat and gold will mean keeping it at home, a stack of fiat that will burn when your house is on fire. 
Bitcoin intrinsically has properties like a digital asset and better storage criteria.

It is relatively easy for btc to gain over 6% a year and if that is your interest rate on your debt, perhaps it wont be wise to sell off now. You can however sell a bit every month just incase as opposed to cover the debt in full right away. 
Then again, based on the above advice it seems like it will be wise to take out a loan to buy btc. That is terrible idea. Are you working fulltime? If yes, pay off the debt from your salary.

You are in crypto so you should already know mistakes here are costly, you said it yourself and you also mentioned you have a lot of experience receiving and sending funds. You just contradicted yourself. 
If Btc dropped to nothing you will probably not care about the loss. If somehow your lawyers get through, there is a possibility you will only be compensated for the dollar amount of your btc on the day of incident. I dont think your lawyers have any chance especially since it isnt a huge enough amount that you will want to spend tons on best lawyers. 
My advice is work more hours and buy back that 1btc. It sucks, but all those hours you spend on this case could have gone to working and buying btc.

The 15bil vs 1bil equivalents where numbers i had from fake volume vs real volume awhile back. I wont know what numbers it is exactly today in last 24hrs , but i think it wont be far as a point of comparison. I took the real numbers from that exchange website supposedly with real volume, could be openmarkercap, i forgot
@_date: 2019-12-13 04:00:35
I think one great indicator will be volume. Compare btc vs any financial asset at 150b mcap and look at their volume. I am serious, look at the huge difference in volume with maybe Apple stocks vs BTC. What does volume tells us? If anything, it tells us a high number is being exchanged at current price which means good price consolidation. The rest up to you to figure it out.
Apple is at 1.2tril mcap with 34mil volume. BTC much smaller mcap with billions in volume.

Let say 15bil volume only 1bil is real, that is still
a ton of a lot of real volume. Hard to understand unless u do comparison with other financial assets.
For better explanation, many assets around btc mcap goes for around only 1mil or less in volume per 24hrs. Therefore btc is 1000x more in volume than most assets in similar mcap. What u want to make of that is up to u to crunch the meaning.

I read your post and got familiar with the topic. My brief thoughts:  
1) If all the coins must be present to solve the first puzzle, I will imagine that it has to be something about the precise weight of the coins. The coins themselves may have been treated specifically with certain chemicals to make them distinctively at different weight from the original material they were made from.   
2) Either the precise weight of the coin will lead to a specific location or the precise weight will be required to open some latch. This is because anything to do with the art on the coin can be solved just from pictures alone and need not require the actual coin. Of course this also means we take the word of the WoodCollector to be true.   
I think the real fun happens after the OP unlock the first clue and realize there are more clues. Seems like an adventure nonetheless. Do keep us updated but I will also imagine that you may have to inevitably consider your security to be very important. If your treasure hunt will take years, by that time the treasure could be worth billions and let us say that every asshole on the globe will be out to find you. Which will lead to a sequel, the next book, the curse of the coins.

Take note that by having CB hold a large amount of crypto for the average user, it also incentivize hackers to constantly spend more and more time trying to break CB. How much CB holds will impact how much time hackers spend figuring out CB. Allowing CB to hold more while their security level grow slowly will mean you are increasing your risk. It becomes a matter of time. Do take note that CB is run by people, human error happens a lot more often.
Crypto is trying to innovate fast enough to solve this problem, where people want to hold coins on an exchange that is hassle free, yet completely independent from the exchange security flaws. LGO is building such a solution where it operates as a hybrid dex and if you happen to lose your private keys, they have it stored in a physical vault that can only be accessed with your consent. Hackers hacking into LGO do not get access into your funds.

Your life is worth more than 10,000 bitcoins. You have 1 life and there are plenty of bitcoins out there. Within your lifetime you can still make profitable investments.
Look at it this way, there was no real bad luck involved and everything is as intended. You treated a $60 investment as a $60 investment and clearly did not understood the importance/value of DLT technology. The level of information you had was worth for you to make at most an investment that is worth a few meals and because you had little information plus you had better things to do, you treated the investment without a care in the world. Take note that your broken laptop is probably worth more than your investment at the time of breaking since it can be sold for parts or be repaired, yet you did not treat your broken laptop with any sort of responsibility towards your ownership. Your mom throwing crap out is not out of the ordinary, it is like all moms, while you not taking ownership of your own stuff is out of the ordinary.
It seems like you take ownership very lightly. It also seems like you have little self love towards yourself because before bitcoin blew up, you didn't seem to be happy with your life anyways. What you did was a gamble, and what is worse in your gamble was that you did not even care to keep the ticket well. You only have yourself to blame but life goes on.
There are a ton of opportunities out there and you are still doing little to improve on your life. Your attitude is the issue here not the issue of losing bitcoins. You have zero discipline and zero professionalism in your life. Be grateful for what you have and start taking responsibility.  
  
Btw, the tragic is not you losing bitcoins, the real tragedy here is that in 2014 when you found out that bitcoin is being taken seriously, you could have worked hard and started investing into bitcoin. That was your second chance. That was a great time for you to redeem yourself. Now you lost your second chance for 5 years. Right this moment, today, this week, this month, this year 2019, is your third chance because the reality is most people have no clue what is DLT, blockchain or bitcoin. They may have heard about it but they know almost nothing about it. The technology is still young, as young as it will get in 2019.
Right now is all that matters. It is great you took the courage to share your moment on reddit, now we are telling you, you are given a third chance.
TLDR: You are still an early adopter if you start now.

Very wise of you. I agree that if you do not have the ability to save up for investments in the first place, there is a high chance you do not have the ability to pay off the loan for investments. I see so many people trying to get funds for start-ups, getting loans to buy bitcoin etc. Even my cousin is trying to get funding for his start-up and he has been at it for 3 years now just trying to find sponsors. So few of the Internet generation are accountable for themselves yet they pride a lot on 'freedom' when few really have any freedom.

Pls correct me if I am wrong.  
Ross's argument is basically that he is a libertarian and he created Silk Road as a free market place. Bulk of the trading on Silk Road are vices like narcotics. The question is should he be held responsible when he possibly already knew what Silk Road will represent and furthermore he profited from all the vices.   
If Silk Road represented human trafficking, paid rape crimes, pedophilia, child abuse, snuff films etc. Will the same people that support his clemency still stand strong? Narcotics isn't something people are extremely sensitive about and the thought of weed makes people soften up. This isn't the case for child abuse and the rest. 
Therefore the question is, if people will revoke their support when Silk Road is tied to my second representation of rape crimes and child abuse, is there still an argument for the first representation? Whereby clearly he is responsible for a marketplace that dealt in vice and he profited from it nonetheless.   
He is definitely guilty. That is why he is in prison, this should be clear with everyone. The only issue is his sentence is too harsh. However, granting a full pardon just doesn't make sense (referring to asking for presidential pardon).

4) BTC since 2013 let say at $100/btc, has gone over 3700% with today's pricing.
BTC since 2015 let say at $200/btc, has gone over 1800% ROI.
While the OP only made 50% ROI at best. What I am saying is not that he should not invest into crypto, but his strategy has a critical flaw simply by looking at the above numbers. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 11:30:56
Are you saying that there are zero rich people in crypto or are you trying to say that there ought to be more rich people in the game? What point of comparison are we looking at though.
My understanding is that there are rich people that invested in crypto for example Tim Draper and when they do invest they can get quite serious about it. Go to Silicon Valley and there are plenty of people there who are in crypto as well. Another question is, what do you consider as rich? How do we collect the data?
1) Are we going to look at how much a person invest into crypto and use the amount of investment as a point of comparison?
2) Are we going to look at amount of crypto investment over their net worth in percentage?
3) Are we going to look at any dollar value investment so long as the guy is a millionaire? 
4) Are we going to consider all the crypto millionaires and billionaires? How do they fall into the bigger picture.
Another point to consider, how distributed is bitcoin currently? There was an article on Reddit awhile back that talked about how the amount of unmoved bitcoin that is at least 1 year old has just recently reached 50%. Unmoved bitcoin is a representation of holders holding long term so do we take that into consideration? Key points to consider as well is that there are huge bag holders of bitcoin and they are by far very wealthy. Therefore the bulk of crypto wealth isn't necessarily in the hands of the poor, they are mostly either in wealthy people holding big bags or people made wealthy from crypto. Your initial voice sounded like it was 100% poor people holding bitcoin bags and hoping for rich people to buy them out when the reality is it is rich people holding the big bags in crypto and it is other rich people not wanting to be made fool and make the rich even richer lol.
I will say this, there are a huge assortment of people in crypto already. When adoption gets more, naturally more investment will pour in. Right now I think the value of crypto has to catch up with its price. What this means is that the problems that crypto can solve has to be big enough. If bitcoin is at a market cap of 70bil today, it has to be able to solve an actual 70bil problem. The solution must be already in place with a worth that much for example if a blockchain solved a shipping port problem and is already in place and it saves the government 2bil every year in expenses, that is the price of that specific blockchain. The issue is maybe crypto underlying problem solving value hasn't caught up with the price yet. Bitcoin isn't solving any 70bil problem just yet.

All btc addresses without any txid for over a year (represents holders) and this becomes significant when 50% or more of the addresses are holders. This is based on btc history. However, we can come up with a few arguments like many small btc accounts during the ico explosion where ppl perhaps bought a few bucks of btc for kicks from referral programs and just didn't bother about their btc etc. I forgot if the person was able to filter for a minimum of btc in the address. Anyways I tried to look for the article but cannot remember where I read it, sorry about that.

This reminds me of the strategy pickpockets use. They put a sign at the train station "Beware of pickpockets" and people that read the sign will motion for the pocket holding their wallet to double check if their wallet is intact. This is the best signal to the pickpockets because now they know which pocket has the wallet. The hardest thing for a pickpocket is to determine which pocket holds the wallet btw.  
Just pointing this out because the location could be not very secure and it is easy to target tourists since it will be easy to tail a tourist that will highly reside within a close proximity for several days, getting drunk, and bringing newly acquainted ladies home. The best mixture for a grand crypto robbery.

A person with that kind of money to invest in a tech that he doesn't appropriately backs up says only one thing, that he has a lot of extra cash lying around and he clearly didn't think much into it. Such a person that is 'rich' won't be bothered about returning computers to find a more suitable fit, he will just buy a few computers. **A computer cost way less than his investment into crypto, yet he is more diligent with finding a suitable computer than being diligent with his crypto?** Doesn't make sense.

Someone already did something similar to this. The guy made a way to collect the data to show number of BTC addresses that have not made any transactions for X number of years. Therefore, if let say you consider an account with 10 years of zero transaction as a lost account, you can begin with that. The main aim for why he did this was to find out when is BTC bottom. What he found out was that when the number of accounts that have no transactions for at least a year goes to over 50%, that is when the bottom is hit.
Yes, he found out that we are currently near the 50%.

How about this instead. If you took the time to ask reddit, I am guessing this 100k or whatever that is left in crypto is something big enough that you do not want it to go to wasted opportunities.
Take out half of it or some amount of it and still leave some in crypto. Crypto currently has a way higher probability of turning a significant profit in comparison to winning the lottery, property roi, stock roi, and even income/salary roi from promotions. Therefore you will always want some portion of your investment portfolio in risky high return assets but it should not be the bulk of it unless you truly believed in the tech.  
**Take note, you cannot afford to be outside of crypto. The opportunity cost too high.**

Watched the video, I think will be better if there was some visuals rather than chewbaca. 
I think what he said makes sense and I agree, except one thing. I think there are some subjectivity on how to see something as DCA. For example, DCA over a period of many years vs a period of a month. Due to the smaller time frame, the penalty on DCA is reduced and allow for extra benefits that a one time investment won't.
Extra benefit of smaller time frame DCA:
To allow for personal experience to affect decision making. We can research and read all we want but personal experience is very valuable. For example, one may directly learned of new scams or be a victim of a scam and therefore act more decisively. In my first investment into crypto, I was immediately scammed of USD200. The exchange was fake and they had fake review sites to rank the exchange and promote it. I did not have any close friends who knew about crypto nor anyone I trusted to consult in. I am also in a country where there were very few information on exchanges. I took the leap, got scammed. If I had invested one lump sum, I think I will be crying. 
I went on to finally find a reliable way to invest, had to test exchange, learn about wallets, learn about trading crypto, participated in crypto community and with my accumulated experience of over a month, I started to understand a lot more than what is offered online. I understood there were way more manipulation than people know. Therefore with some amount of personal understanding and reflection, I invested a final sum and went on to manage it. 
DCA in smaller timeframe could allow for reservations to test learned knowledge in case of misinformation since misinformation is pretty rampant these days.

If I have 500k worth of crypto (as advised for the premium service), will I be an idiot? No, I am looking for solid information and fast since time is money and those information don't seem to be easily available.
If they cannot get the website presentation right, how the heck can you entrust them with all your crypto. Simple logic. Their website reminds me of every other scam crypto website out there that treats people like idiots using catch phrases.

Do not mean to offend and initially I was thinking your strategy is pretty good. However, based on today's pricing ($3740) that will mean you made 10% if based on $3397.46 and that 10% is over 3years 6 mths. Which works out to be around 2.86% ROI per year. 
If based on avg price $2500 and from 2013, that will be 49.6% ROI in 5 years so about 10% a year. 
Basically, in conclusion your strategy may not be good since most crypto investors coming from as early as 2013-2015 will have made quite a considerable amount.  
Below are my thoughts on why your strategy isn't amazing:
  
1) You mentioned 5% of your paycheck over 3-5 years. If I assume your paycheck only goes up due to promotion (I think most people get a few promotion over that time), that will mean you are investing a bigger portion in USD as time moves forward which is reflected in a higher average due to a bigger portion of your investment will be in the recent years.
  
2) Your portfolio reflect more risk with time and not a constant risk since you are averaging down but in a manner whereby a bigger portion is always in the recent years and therefore losing out on the rewards from your earlier years due to huge risk in later plays. For example, buying at $19,450 when your lowest was $227.20. That is 85 times the value of your initial investment which in a way reflect 85 times more risky than your initial investment plus more since you will be investing a bigger amount in USD value.   
3) If crypto crashes to almost nothing, you will have spend 3-5 years to lose your money as opposed to people who invested 3-5 years ago and had already realized gains or diversified their portfolio outwards from crypto to reduce risk.   
4) Take note as well since your best ROI is 10% a year, while BTC already went way more than 10% a year, that will mean your passive strategy of just holding BTC and not micromanaging it is under-performing the market by a mega huge margin. Anytime your passive portfolio underperforms the market, when you hardly touch it, I think it is very telling that your strategy do not work.  
I double check my own strategy by ensuring that my extra management must translate to over-performing the crypto market.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:28:53
You are looking in terms of percentages which is incorrect. When it comes to money, the common thinking process is to direct into opportunity cost. When I say 1 million, you do not automatically think about how many years of salary that equates to or think in terms of that percentage over your own net worth. You think in terms of the items that 1 mil can buy, like that 500k house that is in a nice neighborhood that your wife notices, or that nice car at the dealership that you were gleaming over during the car showcase. Or that cruise that was talked about in the brochure your parents send you.
Therefore, in terms of money, people look at what it can buy (opportunity cost). A $10 note can buy very few items therefore the opportunity cost is very limited while a $85k is a huge amount of money since the median American isn't even worth that much, median American household don't worth that much either I believe. See what I am getting at now? **When a person thinks of $85k, they think of a whole new lifestyle they can go by since it is more than their entire net worth.**

Some flaws in your argument:
1) Literally crypto can be more applicable to people living on the moon than fiat or other investments.
2) You focused on rich people sitting out on btc because they are rich and are not desperate as the poor. You forgot to realized that there are a lot of poor people not in crypto as well. The world has 8 billion folks, how many of that are poor? A huge amount. How many middle class? Huge amount. 
Middleclass folks can already afford $4k per btc and they are in more abundance than the very wealthy. If we say 10 poor folks equal 1 middleclass, there are definitely more than enough poor people to go around to buy up $4k btc as well. The only explanation is that btc has hardly been adopted and regardless poor, middleclass, or rich, most people are just not yet in it. 
Think about it, the average person gets paid 3k a month, you get like 15mil of them willing to invest 1 month's worth of wage and btc will be priceless already. You do not need the rich to do so lol.

I am not saying you are timing the market. However, you are in investments because you want to make money. Unless we can agree that all investors want to make money, if not it is pointless to continue. Then again, if you are already too rich, I can imagine your self-interest will not be to make more money but to have a public image by doing good or something. 
I also think that you are probably trying to reduce your risk and that is why you started at 5% every mth. You are not impulsive like going all in and you understand diversification plus being cautious. 
What I am simply pointing out is that there is a critical flaw in your strategy whereby your risk is going up, it isn't staying constant, nor is your risk going down. If this is something you accept then it is fine and your strategy.
I am also pointing out that you have made losses, not gains because you have forgone a lot of gains in your strategy. BTC from 2013 made till today made over 3700% while you only made 50% at best. I can understand that if a person did trading and didn't trade well, so over time he lost BTC while BTC gain in USD value, but you did not trade, in fact you did not say you micromanaged the funds. So you made losses simply from your long term strategy of averaging down. 
Maybe there is a better strategy to employ that can put you at a better position. I am not a great investor so I won't know.

In the future there will come a day where we will have the technology to break and retrieve lost BTC. Securing BTC will become a business and so lost BTC with no vested interest into their security could be cracked into. 
Chances are to do so will be costly, let say 1mil to crack an address. Therefore addresses that are lost and worth over 1mil will be cracked and retrieved. The BTC is then rewarded to whoever that cracked it. Like mining lost BTC. 
This is the beauty of moving forward, most things become possible from incentive and innovation.

Nobody knows how much you have, same as when a thief snatches a lady's handbag, he does not know what she has in the bag but he snatches it because it was easily available. Crypto isnt mainstream enough yet so it is likely people will remember you are the dude in the community with crypto. You are like holding crypto for your community. When crypto goes x1000, your community just need to pay you a visit for some plunder good times. Take note that your personal friends knowing is very different from the cashier and his pals knowing.
All it takes is one person deciding to do something about it with a $3.5 wrench. Then again, it is people who make themselves a better target, that makes the rest of us safer.

Think in terms of probability. Those addresses that you know of could very well be a minority. There are also definitely lost addresses that are below 5 years which are unaccounted for and these should very well be more than the minority that you talked about. Therefore, it is highly likely the % is higher not lower.

What we know is that guy is good at making bad financial decisions. Therefore on that basis we can say that there is a good chance he sold at the bottom and is in the negative.
I've had discussion about crypto before with friends and whenever someone said that he will borrow money to buy crypto, I usually end the discussion. I believe that wealth is about sustainability, meaning a person wants to be wealthy throughout his life not just at one point in his life. This means that the habits that are employed plus how a person makes decision are more important than the short term luck he gets himself into. Yes, my friend that said he wanted to borrow money for crypto has been poor and is still poor.

What you say is correct. However, it also adds a lot more volume, more liquidity, and more consolidation at any price point. My personal take is crypto will do fine without ETF. ETF dont benefit true crypto people, it only benefits people who do not know what is crypto.

What if it is just a natural phenomenon that you have described?
Just like sexy girls have more suitors. Is the dating market being monopolized by sexy girls and handsome guys? Kinda yes. 
I am sure you have your strengths/talents and you have used it to your advantage. Natural phenomenon.

Didnt Kraken had an episode where ETH was crashed to nothing and people with extra low price orders bought ETH. I remember after that episode everyone started to have low orders just incase of a manipulated flash crash. Not sure if that is considered a hacked but it was definitely messed with and people profited from it.
Any exchange that require you to have your funds with them is basically an incentive for people to hack. This will always happen with centralized exchange and the exchange is only as good as the humans that operate it. Do you trust fellow humans? The average human is uninspiring btw.
LGO Market was just launched a month ago for institutions and they have onboarded over 70 institutions thus far. LGO operates as a completely transparent, secure, and trustless exchange where you hold your funds, kept secure using a hardware wallet, and you trade over a hybrid exchange that has all their transactions recorded and encrypted on the blockchain to prevent any form of corruption/front-running. If LGO gets hacked, you lose nothing. They also have market makers to ensure volume and liquidity. The retail version, LGO Exchange, will be launching soon in Q3-4, so stay tune. They are also in the midst of obtaining the fiat license to have crypto/fiat trading. Yes, you are correct, this will be the most secure and transparent exchange in the world.
Disclaimer: Ive been in crypto for a few years now and I've invested in LGO simply because I plan to use the exchange when it launches, it meets all my needs and offers no bullshit. Btw all the current crypto exchange probably has a ton load of manipulation and corrupted practices like front-running. Look up front-running if you have no clue what is it.

Passphrase and hardware wallet should both be in separate secure locations and you are set. 
Extra security will be to have an additional cellphone for 2FA that is not connected to the Internet and is never brought out from the house. Basically nothing should be on your everyday cellphone. 
Super extra security, live in a condo rather than a landed property. I think condos are more unlikely to be caught in a full blaze. Landed property do not usually have indoor fire sprinklers or accessible fire extinguishers.

The problem with your prediction is that it is a 50-50 event. It will either be above 7750 or below it. So you basically did a coin toss, win on your call, and boast about it. Good enough for a 50-50 call, now how about something more precise. Do you know why wall street folks and economists love to do price prediction? For that exact reason that they not only have a 50-50 chance to be correct, nobody remembers their error but when they are correct they remind everyone how brilliant they are. For more information on this specific reading, you can read up Steven Levitt 'Think Like a Freak' or the 'Freaknomics' series. I forgot which book had a case on it and how they proved that the wall street economists predict at a percentage that is lower than a 50-50 outcome.  
If you can make an accurate prediction on a 1 out of 100 outcome situation. Then yes, I think you may have some good analysis going for you.

The OP scenario is 1 out of 2 outcomes, so it is a 50-50 chance. The lottery has a ton load of outcomes if you did not already realized that. I think you need a lesson on probability.

Or maybe he is crazy and went for a x100 on Bitmex and got liquidated.

ic so you are very smart. Now how do you propose you can determine the probability of it hitting below 7k or above 7k? Since 7k isnt out of the question when BTC has shown in history that it can actually go less than 80% in a crash, therefore being below 7k isnt that big of a prediction. Being above it either doesnt have enough analysis going for it. I agree, if you say it will go below $100 and since it isnt within historical low %, then that will have a much smaller probability of hitting. However, again I ask you, did the OP state his probability? No, he just stated an outcome. He said it will be below 7k. He didnt say there is 43.43% to be below 7k. Therefore his statement only mentioned an outcome. 
I am amazed at the reasoning of the above 2 ppl, one person called the lottery and another called below $100. Please check yourself.
Btw, if you are going to use technical analysis and tell me the probability of it being above 7k or below 7k, I will laugh. Why? My personal understanding is that TA mostly dont make people rich. All the traders I have known my whole life all tell me exactly same thing, they use TA, none of them made their wealth from TA. Statistics say that 95% of ppl lose money in financial markets, look at the stock/traders forum and you will notice everyone talks about TA, now ask yourself if you think these ppl should be in the 95% or not? When everyone uses TA and when the statistics show that 95% lose money, 4.9% break even and 0.1% make money, I will say that the ones that make money have a strategy that isnt commonly used. Therefore, telling me your probability based off TA/indicators equals nothing to me. I hope you get rich that way.
To further illustrate why crypto TA is even more nonsensical, we already know that crypto is heavily manipulated if you are in crypto space long enough. I personally have caused a specific alt coin to crash over 10% simply from selling my stack. The market cap of the token at that time was 700mil. Imagine if you were a TA guy, will it help you? Same reason why I laugh at all TA people in crypto space.

The money in the bank is compromised when the UK fall. A 85k insurance isn't worth anything if UK falls and GBP goes to nothing.
For Bitcoin to fall, the world must fall.

Many people here talked about the scenario of how fiat dies and Bitcoin explode in value.
When fiat really dies, one Bitcoin is not worth many millions anymore because there is no fiat. If all transactions are in Bitcoin, then people will no longer look at terms in fiat but rather satoshi, now how many satoshi to buy a dozen egg? That is the only thing you have to think about. If a guy is getting paid 0.01BTC per day at work, that will be the perceived average salary without any conversion to fiat and all living expenses probably will be a factor from that amount.
I will say that when fiat dies and BTC becomes the new currency (if this does happen), then it is highly possible that BTC may enter a deflation in comparison to fiat and this is because it is no longer perceived in fiat value. This deflation is in comparison to the btc/fiat value up to the point when fiat is completely useless.
Maybe there will be a short fallout. When the economy returns, I am selling eggs for 0.001BTC per dozen, do you want to buy them? Since eggs could be more valuable then, you will want to buy them. In a fallout, BTC actually becomes less in value since it is not food nor materials for shelter or protection. People may prefer to barter per say. Im just thinking out loud haha.
In the above scenario where fiat dies a slow death, I can 100% with certainty tell you that a chicken farm is worth more than btc. You will want to be collecting chickens lol.
