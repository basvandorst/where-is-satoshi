So you admit that people aren't flocking to Bitcointalk as you initially claimed, but actually that Bitcointalk pageviews have fallen by 27% since April?
Transaction volume denominated in USD has fallen by over 80% since December.

You're right
I will repost a corrected version of this

Overall network transaction volume denominated in USD has fallen by ~80-90% since December.
Source: 
That's transaction volume within the Bitcoin network, not exchange volume, so it includes all transactions whether cash is paid and recorded or not

Because I live in Australia. It makes no difference whether you use the .com.au or .com address, it gives the 'worldwide' trend result.
No significant difference between 'bitcoin' and 'bitcoins' either - search volume has collapsed for both. You're grasping at straws.


Also less visitors to bitcointalk, and less visitors to bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com (lookup the alexa ranks). Do 'trolls' (i.e. people who point out the flaws in Bitcoin) visit bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com regularly too?


[citation needed]
Google trends is showing a massive drop.

Says on that page that pageviews have almost halved since April
Alexa also says the site's rank has fallen greatly
So why do you think those stats support your claim that 'people are flocking to the bitcointalk forum'? Or are you merely lying and hoping no-one will actually check?
Here's the thing: Lying doesn't change the facts. The price reflects the truth.
