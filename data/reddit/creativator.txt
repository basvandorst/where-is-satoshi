Peter actually says that monopolies *are* good because they create markets out of nothing, and the existence of a market is always better than its non-existence.
What is bad is when you deny competition for monopolies, limiting the expansion of the market. It's arguable whether patents are legitimate properties or monopoly protections. It's probably split down the middle.

If the future expected price of bitcoin is 100 000$, 1000$ of variability is not very volatile.

Probably nothing, as it is still an extremely speculative security whose prices are macroeconomically irrelevant.
What will move prices are more awareness of bitcoins and more tests of its security and utility, which can come at any time.
When the big hedge fund guys consider bitcoins to be a useful part of their asset allocation in their portfolio, then it will move with the rest of the markets. It will also be in extremely high demand and the technology will be under ceaseless attack.

The dominant investing strategy is to only sell what has a lot of downside to buy what has a lot of upside, and then wait. Selling something *after* it has lost its value is never going to pay off, despite the terrible pain one feels.

According to that chart, bitcoin rose year-over-year. It was also highly volatile.
What would be interesting is a one-year moving average plot.

The state would not be in control of the currency, just its own IOUs, which would be issued in lieu of payment in euros to pensioners, staff, suppliers, etc. These IOUs ("Euros" owed by Greece) would trade on the open market with Euros issued by the ECB and would be quickly devalued based on traders' expectations of Greece's ability to pay.
It would be, in other words, a devaluation of Greece's public debts while maintaining the Euro currency on the private markets.
