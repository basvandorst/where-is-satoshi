Ok, I'm still a noob with only 0.097BTC. I'm very confused with this Coinbase controversy. Should I transfer my Bitcoin somewhere else? And if so, what wallet should I make an account with?

Thanks for being helpful. :)

Thanks! Another thing I've been considering is investing a little bit of my disposable money into Bitcoin to add to what I already have. Partly because it would be neat if Bitcoin kept going up and I made some money. The other part being that when I transfered my Bitcent from my old Coinbase to my new, the fees made it sub bitcent. (0.00973....) Good idea or bad?

I need a skosh of advice. Ok, so 2/3 years ago I discovered Bitcoin and it interested me as a high school freshman/sophomore. Of course I didn't have any money, so instead I collected from faucets and eventually saved up to a full bitcent. I haven't messed with is since. 
After seeing Bitcoin in the news a few times recently I decided to see how much it was worth, and that was $165. It used to be just $2.50
ANYWAYS, the past few days I've been considering trading it to see if I could get any more out of it to help pay for college soon. I still know general little about Bitcoin compared to those on this subreddit. So, what do I need to know, and what should I do? 
Thanks guys.

Well, I got all my Bitcoin for free from collecting from faucets ~3 years ago. Just keep it in Coinbase still?
