I don't think it's the futures, per se. I think it's a lot of things, including people's perceptions of futures. I don't think the futures' volume is significant in and of itself to effect prices. I could be wrong though...
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:11:42
This is true, sir.
Major General William T. Sherman was particularly incensed by the regular delivery of northern newspapers. Newspaper correspondents,he fumed, “should be treated as spies…and
are worth a hundred thousand men to the enemy.” Yet,
like other commanders on both sides, he planted false
information in newspapers, well knowing that the enemy
would read and perhaps believe the deception.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:02:42
You're referring, of course, to Lincoln's bait and switch:
First he justified the war as saving the Union. Then, in January 1863, he switched: now the war was about the freeing of the slaves. (plagiarized)

The Pacific Railroad was a railroad based in the U.S. state of Missouri. It was a predecessor of both the Missouri Pacific Railroad and St. Louis\-San Francisco Railway.
The Pacific was chartered by Missouri in 1849 to extend "from St. Louis to the western boundary of Missouri and thence to the Pacific Ocean."\[1\] Due to a cholera epidemic in 1849, which was a citywide disaster, and other delays, groundbreaking did not occur until July 4, 1851.
In 1865, it became the first railroad to serve Kansas City, after construction was interrupted by the American Civil War. In 1872, the Pacific Railroad was reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railway by new investors after a railroad debt crisis

Union Maj. Gen. John Pope became convinced that he had trapped Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against him. On August 29, Pope launched a series of assaults against Jackson's position along an unfinished railroad grade. The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. At noon, Longstreet arrived on the field from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson's right flank. On August 30, Pope renewed his attacks, seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field. When massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, Longstreet's wing of 25,000 men in five divisions counterattacked in the largest simultaneous mass assault of the war. The Union left flank was crushed and the army was driven back to Bull Run. Only an effective Union rear guard action prevented a replay of the First Manassas defeat. Pope's retreat to Centreville was nonetheless precipitous.

There is no shortage of gold:
China’s reserves of unmined gold are deep and growing. By the end of 2017, the country had identified gold resources and reserves of 13,195.60 tonnes, a substantial figure in itself and an increase of 8.45% year-on-year.
China is also a world leader in gold production. Having overtaken South Africa in 2007, China has been the largest gold producer in the world for 11 years in succession, producing 426.14 tonnes in 2017, equivalent to just over 13% of the global market.

@_date: 2019-08-13 14:35:51
It appears that we've now entered a phase in BTC economics when there exists a moderate, negative correlation between global politics/economics (US/China) and BTC price. With BTC serving as a hedge against adverse market conditions, good news for the stock markets means a little less need for the hedge. The hedge with BTC, in essence, is being adjusted almost instantaneously:
Trump admin deciding to "delay" tariffs with China led to a sudden surge in equity markets, and a drop in BTC Prices.
This is all conjecture, BTW, but will be interesting to follow over the next few months...

**seen recently on**  r/cryptocurrency**:**
*But Bitcoin is the biggest shitcoin - surviving only because it was first. If it were invented today, it would be laughed out of the space for its lack of scalability, lack of speed, and environmental impact.*
*BTC-LN likewise - for inability to route, for channel funding, for complexity, for cost of opening and closing channels, for complexity.*
*I hope it survives - but only because so far it is the one with mass name recognition, so its price still drives the rest of the market for now.*
I guess it depends upon how one uses the word "shit" in shitcoin. To me BTC "is the shit"...

I was working for a trading company in Chicago that had offices in Singapore and London. We had a lot of GBP @ Barings. The earthquake hit in January '95 and Nick Leeson happened in February '95, and all of the GBP @ Barings got tied up. Fucking chaos, and all of the smart people had no idea what Leeson was doing, and obviously couldn't have predicted that devastating earthquake.

No. Cryptic is an adjective (a cryptic message). A better term for cryptocurrency is the noun "cryptography":
"Cryptography is a method of using advanced mathematical principles in storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those, for whom it is intended for, can read and process it."
Certainly more complex than the example you provided. What price does one put on secrecy/security ? Maybe for some, cryptography is essential at any price.

Despite bitcoin's price falling, some expect this move to be shortlived.
"This type of news is 'universally' negative sentiment, within the crypto space, so we are not surprised to see a dip on all assets today," Fran Strajnar, co-founder and CEO of data and research company Brave New Coin, told CNBC via email.
"We do not see this to be a lasting issue."

If one were to equate the action on the BTC market today in terms of WW2, one could point to the battle of Stalingrad. 
Arguably to mid-November 1942, when the Germans had pushed the Russians back to the west bank of the Volga. 
But from Nov 19th thru that winter, the Russians initiated Operation Uranus. Several other back and forth operations occurred by both the Germans (Operation Winter Storm) and the Russians (Operation Little Saturn), but on Feb 2, General Strecker surrendered to the Russians. 
So expect a bloody mess in BTC thru January 2019, with victory in February.
