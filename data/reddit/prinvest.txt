Depends on what the purpose is, but for fiat/crypto i have mainly used [litebit.eu]( Although if you pay via bancontact (electronic payment system in Belgium for example) they charge a % fee on the buy rather than just a fixed fee on a transaction which actually sucks. Advantage is that you can either store it on the site (in their wallet) or have them transfer it automatically to your own wallet.
Lately I've been using Bitvavo, they also allow fiat/crypto and purchase with electronic payments are at a fixed fee. Bitvavo is an exchange, but they also have a "basic" portal which is very straightforward. Fees seem to be ok, only withdrawal i've already noted they are sometimes a bit higher than you would expect (+ first time i withdrew it was subject to manual check. Don't know if it's always like that, but i dropped them an e-mail and was solved within 5 minutes).+ Bitvavo gives you a refund on your first 1K EUR transactions (on a 7 day window I believe)
Drop me a note if you would like to use a referral :).
edit: both have a KYC process

Just be ready to accept that price drops after you buy, and increases after you have sold.
Not saying it will be the case, but just get ready for it ;-)

It's a broker for the Europeans :). Based in Netherlands.
Easy to work with, though not the cheapest and if you pay with the payment app the fee they charge is a % of the amount instead of just a fixed fee lol. Complained about this before as whether I pay them 1 euro or 10.000 euros it's the same transaction.  
More annoying is that sometimes they stop support to some off the crypto or put it in maintenance (and i think the maintenance is coming on not ideal pricing times ;-) ).

solid advise, don't confuse is with "i invested more than I wanted to lose" (that's the ship i'm on)
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:57:24
if there would be a guide, there would be no speculation. If there would be no speculation price would remain stable. If price would be stable many will lose interest, as many don't care for the product but only want profit (and preferably unrealistic high profits preferably overnight)
I think when prices pick up again, it will be with lots of waves as people will try to dump some of their stack as of the moment they're in the + (unless greed takes over again and they wait and hodl until the next drop ;-) ).   
But thanks for the overview, would be cool if it comes through (then again, predicting crypto price is like the lottery. Maybe you are right/win maybe not, but we still play :p )

Well, i'm guessing that if he never made the mistakes he made he wouldn't have sold illegal stuff and charged btc for it, hence he would be just a regular McDo employee or something :).
But no insights on it, also didn't hear much about it. Only thing i'm thinking about lately is that lots of crypto will eventually be lost/stuck. As practically all is anonymous, and it's not smart to share your keys not many people know how much you own. For me personally, if I die tomorrow: no one has a clue that i have crypto, nor how much i have. Nobody else has access as i never shared my keys. So unlike my bank accounts which go automatically to my wife/kid, this doesn't exist for the crypto part.  
I'm hesitant to disclose the keys, because there's no way to turn back transactions if someone does a silly thing :p. And if it's money related (or in this case crypto) I trust no one
@_date: 2019-11-20 11:50:03
maybe wait to sell until you're 18. Then at least you may have less issues with the fact of being underage.
not sure which countries you are all in, (not relevant for your amount though), but make sure you don't screw over your parents by earning big on crypto and they don't know. (were i'm from if a kid earns above a certain amount it's to be added in the parent's tax return, they lose child support funds etc.) again, your ten bucks will not have an impact, just putting it out there

Which bank do you use? I've never had issues, but I buy through 'Bancontact'. Not sure what country you are in. Maybe the transaction is much higher then what the bank is used for your account? Then the system will automatically flag "fraud". Had this when I was travelling to USA couple of years ago with my credit card. It was automatically flagged as potential fraud as I had never used the card stateside before (but was easily solved).

I don't know German tax law (but I guess it will not differ largely from other countries), but this might be interesting for Belgium:
 [ 
Those are the questions that are asked when going for an advanced agreement with the authorities. They need that information to determine the type of income (3 possibilities). In your case it's probably very obvious that it will be treated as professional income.
In general I can give you the advice (and yes i'm a tax consultant :-) ), if you think you don't/will never have to pay tax... you're wrong.  
Also interesting is that income from criminal (or non-regulated work) is in principle also subject to tax.
\+ As a freelance  don't you need to send your invoices per assignment to the company you did the assignment for? Not sure if such a thing is already possible for accounting law (don't think crypto is accepted as currency for the accounting books). And if it would be possible it can potentially be very annoying at the end of your accounting year if you would need to translate your currency (crypto-eur) and it suddenly had an immense boost. But congrats on getting a crypto job !  
(my non-official advise would be: do this on the side of your regular job and try to avoid declaring it as long as possible)

idd, and better than in Belgium as in Belgium the punishment is much more severe for fraud or tax evasion than committing a murder...

Broker? Your terms and conditions literally state that you are not a broker and should be seen as gambling site... 
*"* ***This site is not an*** *options exchange nor is it an options* ***broker****. The tournaments and games of skill offered by this site are not a financial product but rather are an e-gaming product. "*
Also, "realistic payout" is a bit counter-intuitive as in the same terms is stated you get a 190% return on the investment.  
But oh well, best of luck. I'll keep piling up my reds over here and buying yet another dip

Sheldon, Howard, Rajesh and Leonard claim to have minted btc on their old laptop, but ended up being stored on a usb drive which was lost resulting in them not being rich (except for Raj, who already was)
Spoiler: Stewart found the usb and sold it for 10 usd, not realising it "contained" BTC.

@_date: 2019-12-04 08:15:31
Correct, for the current/future income. The tax bill they received is still payable. Probably should have clarified further in my first comment :-).
@_date: 2019-12-12 07:53:17
it's safe in the hardware wallet to the extend they don't find/have your keys. But I guess that if they would suspect that you have a descent amount on it they will probably threaten you to give up the keys or to unlock so they can transfer your funds out.
Hardware wallets are safe to keep everything on, safe if you would lose the device or if it gets stolen from the house. But remember that knowledgeable robbers/intruders can put pliers on your fingers to give up keys (like they would for your banking card code. So in the latter it's probably only safe to the extend you can uphold and live without a couple of fingers ;-)

Already happened in Belgium. Though I think it's unrealistic to close them overnight, in Belgium they just pulled out all cash and shut them down for a couple of weeks and you had to drive further to find an ATM somewhere indoor. And then they realised they were pushing people to other banks and other payment mechanisms so they put cash in again.
@_date: 2019-12-04 08:13:36
Note that I was referring to the already received tax bill. A loss can perhaps offset the current year income but the tax bill they received remains payable.
But makes me curious how it will be treated, because they lost money indeed. But whos money? They were hacked, but I guess it's the average Joe's funds that were still on the exchange that got taken.
Anyways, 2 things I apply: 1) don't leave it on an exchange and 2) if I would make alot of money with crypto someday I will happily pay (some) taxes
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:21:20
What if they figured out that if they stay away from crypto, they still win on Wall Street and other lose on crypto.
Also not sure if you would want Wall Street boys trading actively on crypto because then prices could swing between 1 and moon and 1 again in a couple of minutes/hours (figure of speak). And yes, at first I also thought they would come in, but not so sure anymore.
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:22:37
Probably depends on the region. But it's still taxable, he does realise a profit by trading so the gain is taxable. It's not the withdrawal of the funds that triggers the realisation.
I think that i general this will be seen as professional income (at least in my region) and taxed at the normal personal income tax rates (which in my region - Belgium - are based on progressive scales, so you'll end up easily in the 50% tax). At least that's the case if you actively trade. We have some potential "escapes" if you can prove you didn't actively trade (but then you'll still have 30%)
Only case you would have in Belgium to avoid taxation is that you can show it was a lucky shot... will be difficult for bitcoin but might be the case if you invested during an ICO and after a couple of years you sell.
disclaimer: i'm not saying you should declare the gains, just saying that in principle it should be taxed ;-)
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:14:46
Maybe additionally some info on how I will do my taxes (if I would have profit):
\- profit from crypto i invested in during IC: would argue this is tax-free as it was an investment in "good faith" and because you believed in the investment (ofcourse don't sell within a year but keep it a couple of years)  
\- profit from buy/sell: various income. It'll be annoyingly expense (let's say 30% tax), but I would think that they should accept it.
And that's how I hope to stay out of jail and still earn some money (although the latter is out of my hands)
Disclaimer: if you buy/sell on a very regular basis (example daytrading) it'll be seen as a professional income.

Correct. Got my Ledger last week and currently moving some of the crypto to the Ledger daily. Started with stuff that was held on smaller exchanges as they might be more subject to problems when everyone pulls their crypto out.
And yes, it was a bad idea to have some of them still on an exchange, but in this market my accounts on exchanges were not worth the hack ;-)

Adoption will remain very difficult, as the only thing an average Joe gets from bitcoin/crypto is: ow, it's fast cash, profit for the lazy (or fast loss). And that's also how it's in the mainstream media. Too many people are unaware of what crypto/blockchain represents, how it works and especially how it would contribute to their lives/world
