Similar situation. I owned 4 L3+'s. Ran 24/7 for something close to a year I believe. Not a single issue on any of them.

I hope this gets to the top and LocalBitcoins makes you whole, must be frustrating.

Correct. They will attempt to pull it from his bank account. If they cant gain access to that, as soon as PayPal realizes you arent going to pay up they send it to a collections agency which you agreed to let them do when you checked "i agree" in the terms when you made your account. Thats where the hiy on your credit comes from. The unpaid debt.

Chargebacks are a bitch right? At first you're like "oh well CLEARLY I am not in the wrong. I sent the product. Ebay has a record of this. They wouldnt let this happen." And then even after hours of phonecalls and transfers they basically tell you "sorry." So now its either dont pay the negative balance and PayPal will try to auto withdraw it from your bank account(Because hey, you agreed to that terms of service when you made your account). Closed your bank account because you think you can get around PayPal stealing your money? Enjoy the 8 phone calls a day from collectors and the credit score hit you take because of the uncollected debt. Or just pay paypal the negative balance. Fucking PayPal. Ive been through it all. I have been -$1,500.00 at one point from chargebacks. It SUCKS. STEER CLEAR OF PAYPAL AND EBAY.

I made the same mistake a while ago with ETH and was able to do some sort of fee replace thing. I assume that's what all the people saying "Replace by fee" are talking about. I would look into that.
