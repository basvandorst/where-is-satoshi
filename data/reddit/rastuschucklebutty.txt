Unpredictable, then. Hope they get better soon!

Looking at social media, I think it's flaws in the way Coinbase systems are programmed. Maybe they've expanded to fast and their systems get overloaded (?) There are A LOT of people complaining about Coinbase losing money; but it's probably a small percentage of people who get unlucky. Like me! I sent the 450 Euros on 9th Feb. They left my UK bank account just fine. As of 24th Feb they're still not in my Coinbase account. Yeah!

Right. Not sure how well people will dig that!

Thanks for advice. May well do this.

Maybe it was just an awareness thing that took time to hit a 'take-off' level of awareness. The more people talked about it, the more people knew about it, the more people got curious, the more people bought it. 
Also, it wasn't that easy to buy crypto pre-2017. Not many places you could buy it. In 2017 it became much easier to buy, as a lot more companies set-up to buy &amp; sell crypto. And they advertised. So the market opened up to a lot more people, the advertising reached a lot more people, and a lot more people bought crypto. As the price started to go up and up, more and more people saw a winner and the price snowballed from there. That's my take on it, anyway. Wish I'd bought earlier!

I don't think this is what's happened because the money left my UK bank account almost immediately. However, sometimes things are not as they appear. So I'll check it out. Interesting take. Thanks.

Update. 
I sent my money to Coinbase on 8th Feb (2018). The money disappeared so I logged an incident with Coinbase and also telephoned them. 
The Coinbase operative on the phone said he had 'not known it to take more than six months' to give people their money back. He would not be drawn further and seemed familiar with the situation. 
So that's the level of 'service' Coinbase offer when they lose your money: sorry, our bad; we'll sort it out for you within six months; meanwhile, tough luck. 
On 20th April I got an e-mail from Coinbase. Basically, they stated that it was my fault that my money went missing (although I've sent them money previously in exactly the same way, and it worked). They added that they'll put the money back in my bank account (not my Coinbase account) within 48 hours.
I checked my bank account next day and they have indeed put my money back in there. 
So they took about ten weeks to sort it. 
Then put the money back in my bank account. 
At least it wasn't six months.
But that's the best I can say for these people.
Will now look elsewhere for my crypto dealings. 
Thanks to those who've already recommended Binance and Bitstamp.
