Could you expand on the idea? Why crappy? I've noticed it is a little buggy on Android, it met the purpose pretty well in iOS... what do you mean by crappy?

Not enough upvotes here. Linux is safer, OP would never have installed dodgy wallet in the first place.

Does bubble really applies in this case. I usually think that a bible happen only in situation where credit is not payed within the limit date, the creditor holds further investments,thus causing stagnation. Could someone explain whether bubble talk really applies in this bitcoin context?

This sounds very BBish, I reckon you'll end up needing a lawyer to solve that. If you have the receipt they should have accepted your claim.
Not related, this bank has recently push out a cryptographic method of logging in that tracks all the users internet history. You would be better off of it.

Could you define bubble? I always tend to think that to be a bubble there is the requirement of some kind of debit. So there is a bubble in a real estate scenario when leasers can't pay anymore,for example.

That is very subjective. Thanks for the answer.
