Nothing has changed. We're still in a nasty bear market. This pump is done by traders who take a quick profit from the delusional kids who think we're going to the moon. The rest of the world still doesn't care and isn't suddenly buying. 
The delusional euphoria here will soon be over again. 
You'll notice it when the first posts appear again talking about how the price doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:34:31
Till something better is created. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:25:32
We already had this post. And nobody cared. 
And a big part of that 150k are bots btw. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:53:21
It's funny how people start buying when the prices go up. At 200 nah not interested. At 250 ooooh shit panic buy!
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:25:05
Because you were buying at lower levels i need to get a grip? Seriously?
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:50:29
Considering we've been going down for a year i assume you lost a shitload of money. I didn't. I kept my money in my bank account and they paid me for that. And sorry, i don't have any questions. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:10:37
You're not gonna make a few 1000 dollars. I can guarantee you that. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:06:13
Uh ok. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:55:59
Yes. That must be it. And not because they can't handle the truth. Because this sub is known for handling the truth so well. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:13:39
See how i got downvoted while i am 100% right. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:00:48
What a surprise. The cultist also turns out to be a conspiracy nut. What are the odds. 
Can you show us your proof that Tor is compromised?
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:54:46
No. Get real. 
And i suggest you stay away from investing. You are clearly very young and have no idea what you are doing. You're the typical panic buyer/panic seller. The kind that always ends up losing their money. Then again i'll be there to buy your coins when you sell at the bottom. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:04:23
Ah now i see what you are doing. You are angry at me for not having a problem with my bank. I should be calling them crooks and say how horrible they are. Gotcha. 
Because i put my money there and hardly lost anything compared to Bitcoin holders i have my head up my ass. Funny how that works. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:24:31
Yes. I'm such a troll for pointing out people most likely don't want to invest in something that lost most of its value over the last year. Such a troll thing to do. Typical troll. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 08:06:22
Only in the Bitcoin sub is the first reply to a scam post spam for another scam. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:12:00
Because people think this will happen so they start buying. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:26:35
Haha you're so full of shit. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:38:08
Cultists like you. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:44:18
You're either 14 years old or autistic. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:06:28
Yes. It's highly recommended that you keep your future money of the internet offline. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:24:56
Delusional. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:42:00
Calm down kiddo. I own more coins than you ever will so stop making yourself look like an idiot. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:32:25
Sure. So how many years will it take to get it implemented?
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:35:20
No. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:06:40
I was! The price went up 5 dollars! And already dropping again. Never been so wrong in my life. 
Other than that it is good news but nothing much will change. Just as i expected. In 3 days from now it's business as usual. A slow bear market and no new people. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:11:49
I wish someone would've given me a Bitcoin for every time someone said this in the last 12 months. But this time it's different, right?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:25:22
It's funny how the "new" page is 90% filled with posts about the price yet you get downvoted. Your post is inconvenient in this thread. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:31:41
Just like the 50 other announcements from companies last year absolutely nothing special will happen. The price won't rise 1 dollar and 3 days from now nobody gives a shit anymore. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:52:28
I'm gonna stop discussing this because every post i make gets downvoted because i'm not 100% positive about Bitcoin. It's insane. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:44:09
Good thing they paid me for it then. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:14:43
It is a known fact. Last year there was a spam attack on this sub and 1000's of new fake users were created. There were a lot of posts about it and mods confirmed. And of course also the usual bot sign ups just like every sub out there gets pretty much daily.  
Sorry to hurt your feelings that such things happen and not every one of those 150k people are die hard Bitcoin cultists. 
Yes, reality is harsh. Especially for Bitcoiners as a lot of them prefer fantasy. 
Oh question for ya. Do you happen to be one of those people who think there are paid shills and downvote bots here run by bankers?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:17:58
You pump then you dump. This market is controlled by traders. Not new users who want to get in. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:23:44
This place is absolutely hilarious!
Look what i posted earlier today. 
Nothing has changed. We're still in a nasty bear market. This pump is done by traders who take a quick profit from the delusional kids who think we're going to the moon. The rest of the world still doesn't care and isn't suddenly buying. The delusional euphoria here will soon be over again.
You'll notice it when the first posts appear again talking about how the price doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-01-27 08:41:02
Others already posted this off topic item trying to start a circle jerk. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:43:03
Can you point me out the part where i said nobody here was buying at lower prices?
Edit: still waiting. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:21:25
Highly doubtful. Outside the extremely small Bitcoin world hardly anybody cares about Bitcoin. The Greek population has no reason to suddenly move to Bitcoin and big investors aren't suddenly gonna move to Bitcoin either. 
So just like Cyprus back in 2013 it seriously doubt it will have any effect on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:22:26
You're not stating it is a fact??
The US Government, the DEA have a heady investment in others not knowing TOR is compromised.
Maybe you need to work on your writing style a bit. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:45:44
I think we're supposed to grab each others cock and chant BITCOIN BITCOIN BITCOIN!
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:24:42
Because you realized how retarded your logic is. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:13:20
Because my account is 1 day old it somehow isn't true? When does it become true exactly? At 10 days? 30? Please explain. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:28:25
Sure sure. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:40:41
No my little cultist. We won't hit 500 or more today. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:12:16
I don't have a main account you fucking retard. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:58:27
Have you got the slightest proof of paid shills?
Nevermind. I already know the answer. 
Do you see the fantasy world you people live in?
Not all 150k sign ups genuine Bitcoin users? Impossible! Not acceptable! They are real!
Paid shills? Why, of course. No proof but they are here for sure! Who needs proof anyway!
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:13:45
Turn off your vpn?
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:26:52
Why do these "the price doesn't matter" posts only appear when we're down? At 1000 the price shouldn't matter either then. But i only see moon posts then. Odd. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:12:20
No? I prefer it if it goes up. Can you explain to me where you get that idea from? It surely can't be just from me pointing out the hypocrisy in this sub. That would be silly. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:00:57
Part savings, part checking and i buy coins only at the bottom. So last year once and this year once so far.  
Ah yes. Downvoted of course. I guess i'm not allowed to post these facts. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:12:05
Just keep living in your little Bitcoin fantasy world. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:04:27
I bet they can't wait to put their money in a currency that lost 80% of its value in the last 12 months. 
Yes. Just downvote everything that's inconvenient and you don't want to hear. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:50:34
Why the fuck would he show some punk kid on the internet proof?
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:08:19
No. But 20 other bad things can. 
C'mon man, posts like this are just silly. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:54:10
Ok. Should've put all my money in Bitcoin instead right? This is where this is going to i assume?
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:21:40
Please don't do that. You'll only annoy people. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:21:58
Is there anything connected to Bitcoin not a scam?
@_date: 2015-01-27 08:29:23
I see you edited your comment. My poor little cultist. Life must be so dissapointing for you. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:28:09
And the first angry posts of dissapointment appear because it turns out to be nothing more than a pump and dump by traders. 
You guys were so euphoric moments ago. Aaaaw.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:48:18
After 6 years hardly anything is done to the Bitcoin core. When exactly do you expect something major like that to be dome? 15 years from now?
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:16:00
I take it you don't use those evil banks yourself?
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:42:26
I have no idea where you got that conclusion from. 
As a Bitcoin owner i would like to see things speed up. It's just frustrating seeing 100's of millions go to companies left and right while the core basically still looks the same as 6 years ago. It's extremely primitive and non user friendly. We want Bitcoin to go mainstream. Well, right now Bitcoin looks like Windows 95 while we are used to Windows 7. And there are no signs of that changing anytime soon. 
I don't understand your answer. I guess it has to do with the fact that anyone who is critical of certain parts of Bitcoin is not welcome here. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:05:03
Absolutely hilarious how you get shitloads of upvotes while we all know better. I never ever seen a place on the internet with such mass delusions as this sub. 
The never ending circle jerk. Without any shame. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:04:18
I can't believe that after all this time and 1000's of people scammed and losing their money that people still fall for this shit. 
I guess this is why scammers are attracted to the Bitcoin world. It's just so easy to scam Bitcoiners. Young kids blinded by greed and the promise of free money. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:32:13
And that has what to do with Bitcoin again?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:17:35
Do you people EVER learn? Like really ever?
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:00:48
What exactly is happening?
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:38:39
No. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:09:25
But you assume they are here without even the slightest proof. Because you want to believe it. See what i mean? When it fits your views proof is not important. If it's something you don't want to hear you demand proof. 
Maybe it's time to become a bit more critical. You know, you can love bitcoin and be critical at the same time. Really. It's possible. You should try it once. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:45:54
How exactly is anybody here supposed to know that? What goes on in your head when you ask such questions? And yes it's irritating indeed because it gets asked EVERY SINGLE DAY and the question is always the same: we don't know. We can't see the future. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:06:39
So why don't you tell us what the message is here so i can stop guessing. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:10:24
We'll soon see "the price isn't important" posts again. 
The faster the the downvotes come in the more right you know you are. Because if they hate 1 thing here it's facts and reality. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:59:28
Look, there are a 1000 other things where they can put their money that is safer. Why the hell would they move to Bitcoin? You cultists always act as if it's the only option left besides their own currency. Well, it isn't. If they take their money out of the bank it is because they want their money to be safe and secure and not lose value. 
Bitcoin is the least attractive option in that case. A 12 year old understands this yet the cultists here don't. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:43:49
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:30:52
I explained it here yesterday. Which of course got downvoted. 
The wales saw the kids here go nuts and posting moon pictures all over the place so they pumped the price so those same kids would buy at high prises. Once they bought enough the whales started dumping at 300 and took fat profits. 
This simple fact will be rejected by the cultists here because they refuse to believe this is happening. And they will fall for it over and over again. 
Edit: how cute. The post was removed. This is what i wrote. Including my price prediction. 
You're fooling yourself if you think this is anything else than a few whales pumping and dumping the market to take advantage of the sheep who think we're going to the moon.
You idiots will never ever learn. Blinded by greed you live in your little retarded fantasy world where you're gonna be rich with half a coin.
Below 250 again by tomorrow.
The same sheep are downvoting me because they can't handle these facts. They hate facts! Just make it go away like it never happened and go back to your fantasy land.
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:01:52
Should've used Bitcoin where such scams never happen! 
Or wait, what exactly should we circle jerk about? I'm confused. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:52:00
Oooooh right. That must be the reason and not something else. 
Still, kinda odd how we don't see those posts today or any other day when we go up. Really odd. 
Yes, just downvote it and it will all go away. Like it never happened. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:48:28
And yet still plenty of suckers will fall for this. Greed and the promise of free money makes people completely irrational. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:26:29
I take it you don't use those evil banks yourself?
Edit: odd how he stopped replying once i asked this question. I really wonder why. Anybody any idea?
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:15:07
We already had this post about 5 times. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:40:29
Normal people don't load an Uber account with a few 100 dollars. 
The OP is right. There is no reason why they should use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:50:47
Haha downvoted to hell for being inconvenient.
