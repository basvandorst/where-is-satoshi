Since... last month?
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:42:30
[Looking at the mempool]( it should actually go through very soon. We're heading into the 50-70 sat band now.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:58:07
There's 100 years until the reward is fully removed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:50:56
Problem is, BCash will come across the same issues. In fact won't all coins so far? At least there's work on layer 2 solutions on going for bitcoin.
Of course a block size increase could seriously help congestion at this time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:52:02
Fuck sake, that thread doesn't bode well. There are coin rewards for 100 years that will provide security for the network. We'll be living on multiple planets by then and if the block size is never increased how the ever living fuck do they expect it to be functional?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:23
Problem is a hard fork is required each block size increase. I say 4MB to bring that mempool down in a reasonable amount of time. But I've pulled that size out of my behind.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:21:00
I really think a block size increase needs to be pushed ASAP. How many objections would there be when the mempool is in the state it's currently in?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:40:46
Why would they?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:21:00
Put a piece of paper in the bowl first and you'll never sell again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:36
So what you're saying is: the price has gone up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:55:43
Agree 100% with you here, this is looking far too far in the future and ignoring the issues currently faced. I appreciate work towards more efficient block space usage but that will not bring about low fees anywhere near fast enough.
Now I find myself hoping for a reasonable S2X or equivalent fork.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:33:28
A more huge increase than +100% in a month?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:13:33
I chortled but yeah, not cool.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:39
Total pending transaction value is way smaller than the last time there were this many unconfirmed in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:20:39
They all work as Japanese seed words.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:59:14
The value of crypto is in network size.

Tell her BCash is Bitcoin and you'll get some headroom.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:42
BCash isn't working on off chain solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:22:55
I don't like the rejection of off chain scaling, I don't like the figure heads of BCH. Those are my personal concerns about bcash.
I'm less concerned about centralisation of the lightning network when it's designed to be trustless.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:43:04
At [the rate]( fees are dropping the mempool should be empty not long after boxing day. Anyone who wants to transfer small funds should probably do so around then.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:20:21
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:15:14
I couldn't get the seed right, tried forwards and backwards but no bueno.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:05:50
It's called a channel.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:23:07
Seems to me the devs are worried about setting a precedent. It also seems to me that right now setting such a precedent could be considered reasonable when fees are escalating so quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:02:26
Well going through their twitters it looks like they all say Bitcoin is fine even with the fees. I certainly find that a little concerning.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:22
Chanukah ended on Wednesday dear.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:37:47
Well the plan is for tuesday at about 3pm GMT but we may be delayed a few minutes if the teleconference hardware misbehaves again.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:17:51
Actually it was 0.5% most of that time. It was only dropped to 0.25% post brexit.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:45:20
You may do better asking I've seen mention there of people paying miners to re-mine a specific block in order to recover it. How that works I have no flipping idea.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:29:31
It's not very clear who is dear.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:32:36
With the price rising so fast, you may well come off better putting it through on a debit card and sucking up the higher fees. I only had to receive a verification code on my phone when I did that with blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:39:54
I wonder if any renewable farms are offloading excess power into mining when power demand drops below their production levels. Seems a pretty good synergy there.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:28:13
It's pretty hard to read to be honest. Even harder to interpret.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:53:19
To add to this, if a block isn't full surely it won't take up the full 1MB limit? And if that's the case this boils down to limiting the maximum number of transactions allowed in a given amount of time.
Assuming the amount of transactions is fixed over a long period of time your total bandwidth use would be the same with either 1MB or 2MB with faster clearing times for users. However in busy times you would get spikes of high bandwidth which I can see could cause issues for some nodes. Monthly caps though? They wouldn't be affected.
Edit: Of course I have seen mention that miners will often add spam to the blocks in order to artificially limit the available space for genuine transactions and push up the fee amount. If they do that then they would just increase their spam and waste all the node's bandwidth in the 2MB case.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:56:34


@_date: 2017-11-03 08:45:36
Ah no sorry, I assumed you'd done your previous purchase with the bank transfer option which requires more verification. I don't know why they'd put you on a block after only spending £50 on a credit card... Can you do a £450 purchase? Do they require more verification for larger amounts put through on a card?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:20:57
How about one good thing?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:25:48
The high fees people complain about happen when the block is full. Surely larger blocks would help with this? Ignoring centralisation issues of course.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:47:06
You can't test for issues and quirks you don't know about unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:31:17
And that's why BCash is dropping harder.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:14:06
Speak to an accountant. Full stop.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:16:42
But she's... I mean it's a red hot market.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:31:12
Google translate does an exceptional job at translating it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:59:07
Alright alright, I assumed it would be obvious that I didn't mean 0 and -1 are the same number.
treats the break even point where expenditure = income as the number zero which probably looks better on a graph.
I was expressing total income as a fraction of total expenditure. So 0 is no income and 1 is the break even point.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:47:55
So create each user who requests it a new wallet, then ask them to transfer into it, then keep watching it until funds appear then move them into my wallet and remove adverts? I'm not sure about that, it doesn't seem very simple from anyone's point of view and user's could always make themselves a new blockchain.info wallet to do exactly that if they wanted.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:28:25
Yeah I completely agree, I'll be going with 's suggestion I think, it's definitely not as complex as I originally thought.
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:07:43
Do I get a bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:48:39
Shouldn't return on investment be 0.000000000000005%?
 Edit: Ohhh there's a negative upfront to imply the same thing!
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:35:32
Will it work if I clean it out of the $5 I currently have do you reckon?
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:55:12
It's not very integrated is the problem, it's asking the user to essentially leave my app to make a payment...to my app with no easy route back and no immediate confirmation. I'm sure there must be a better solution and if not there's a big opening for it.
Edit: didn't think about not giving the user the password to the account, makes it a lot harder for them to get confused.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:20:12
Yes, the difference is that the request at the moment gives me an answer as it's response. With this method I'd have to have intermittent checks to see whether it has transferred. But as you said it would be almost instantaneous from when they deposit into the wallet.
It's definitely a far better solution than what I'm doing at the moment so I shall probably go this route. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:12:02
Yes and that's exactly what I would be doing but currently I'm staring down the barrel of an empty house in negative equity that won't sell so the amount available to invest is in the negatives...
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:42:46
Sorry, how am I meant to make use of that? I don't see an api for integration. Also 1BTC for $497.77? Bit under priced isn't it?
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:53:30
With an auto calculation for current time to 1BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:32:02
Teehee I'm about -50% of my total income in the red each month at the moment. Joys of having an empty house in negative equity that won't sell!
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:34:19
Another option I've seen is the user sending a payment that tags on a callback url on payment completion to contact the seller. Problem with that is it would require me to have a central server.
Option number 3 would be to forward the user to a bitcoin payment app that returns my app confirmation but I'm not sure if that exists yet.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:25:39
This is the thing, when your money is doubling in value each week you're more than happy to share the love! I for one am rather jealous of these folk who could afford the risk and buy in last month or earlier (or now even).
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:08:54
I'm very confused how I missed the last line of this. That library is exactly what I wanted! I'll combine it with just offering up a wallet address and then I'll have all my bases covered.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:48:38
Yep, I'm at the beginning a fairly good career track now and am trying to develop some android apps on the side while I'm at it so hopefully at some point in the future things will come true, especially when the damn house is gone.
Still though, I am a little jealous at not being in a position to join in with bitcoin opportunity.
