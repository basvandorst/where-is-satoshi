If you guys are going to complain about him doing this. How about you get a huge mining rig and use it in a non ghash pool.

The only people just call the sport violent are conservative nimrods. The sport is among the most beautiful.

Sellers have to be exposed to the btc swing since everyone else does. No need to make it tougher on buyers to move sellers in.

You're an idiot. The guy they're are discussing sponsoring is far or intelligent than you and so much more accomplished.  It's a sport. It is filled with guys with degrees who many times are accomplished on some level. You need to step back because there is really nothing as pure as mma. There's no greater test.

Ufc commercials very rarely advertise blood everywhere. The commercial they use on Fox a b day most TV has 0 blood. Their other commercials have robots ..
I know a lot of people here are ignorant and in the world.  The thing is you could very well get lots of the mma market in board much easier than you think. 
I want bit coin associated with greatness.

Yup. Some grade a dungeon turds ruining for the lot. Tools of great people in here a few bad apples but it's alright.

Nah. I'm good with us going full blown into mma.

Joe lauzon ? he's a common redditor. Talk to him about his bone head hobby if you're so inclined. We're you the kid who was always picked last in kickball? I get that vibe.

You insulted a sport to which you are totally ignorant to. Go back to your dungeon monster of cheeto puffs and Rom coms.

The technique to complete that move is graceful and beautiful. I'll put it like this. 
No one loses a fight and says 'oh yeah I could beat you in basketball' or ' I drive a porche' but people lose sports games and will challenge each other to a fight because it's pure. If you think mma has an issue with brain damage check out football rugby and boxing. All are much worse for your head. 
The technique you see in even the most brutal moves is a thing of beauty. It took that fighter years of time to perfect that technique. It's something I understand and admire as one myself.

You have to realize Joe Lauzon has a lot of pool. He's a tech guy with a large Internet following. For example we could have a stipulation where he adds bitcoin as way to pay at his gym. Etc. You will have a lot more pull than you think. other fighters will be interested. Fighters Are More So intellectuals than anyone wants to admit. Dumb people don't win fights at the highest level

This needs to be noted. Joe rogan is relatively new to the scene but is a huge supporter. He's had bit coin people in his podcast (one of the most popular in the world) a few times and likes it

If you simply think mma and the ufc is about violence I feel bad for you. There really aren't baby many things as beautiful, graceful,  and as colorful as mma.

If you knew anything about mma you'd know that grappling is the dominant skill in fights. Just because punching included does not mean it is the only way to win and it's besides the point.  I am absolutely sure Joe lauzon is more intelligent than you. I didn't bring up his redditing as a mark of intelligence o stated it as a mark of accessibility. Also I'm not a teen ager. I run a successful business in 3 hours away from a degree. You are so close minded and elitist.there are several people with phds with in the sport. Masters are not uncommon. This is not a mark of intelligence as much as it is a mark of education but when some of those phds are in biology and electrical engineering it makes a statement.  
You have never competed or partaken in a sport like these? Have you heard of brazilian jiu jitsu?  The martial art that founded the ufc? You don't fucking hit people in it. You are uneducated ignorant and elitist.

No one advertises their dollar because that's not normal a currency is usually forced . Crypto currency is in a unique position.
