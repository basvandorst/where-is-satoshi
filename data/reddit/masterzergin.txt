100% this I do exactly the same and it works flawlessly every single time. 
With this method and the fact GDAX has no fees of limit trades or withdrawals I can use GBP trade BTC, LTC, ETH and send it to a wallet and not pay a single penny in fees.
(You lose a little on revolut GBP &gt; EUR conversion but that's nothing) 
My first ever purchase was £100 of BTC on coinbase to buy then to transfer to a wallet was like £20 of fees! With the above it's £0 winner winner chicken dinner.

Ah... the youth of today will never understand the struggles of the pre social media generation.
The days of MSN messenger.

Maybe bitfinex invested the $ they should have been holding for tether into US stocks... they just got fucked.

Don't laugh at new people entering the market.
What's pathetic about it? He just dipping his toe in the water, if he buys $100 every month it will soon add up.
I don't get why, because of his small investment you are advising him to buy ETH instead, this is stupid advice. 
If you think ETH is a better investment that's fine but that means it's still the better choice even if he but thousands in.
The amount of a coin you own is irrelevant 1/3 vs 1/1000th. The value is what matters, 
You're an idiot.

I suppose you are right, however your point is a bit irrelevant and pedantic. 
For your point to make sense creating a new blockchain would need to be comparable to mining gold on the moon.... it's not new cryptos are made every day. We can't make more gold but we can just make a new blockchain new ones are made all the time. If everyone adopts a new blockchain Bitcoin could plummet. Look what nearly happened in the flippening.
Bitcoin only has worth because people say it has worth (same as gold) but Bitcoin worries me, it's only the top coin because it was first on the scene there are better more advanced coins they just don't have the Bitcoin brand. Gold is gold, it has industrial uses and jewellery etc. 
I'm worried but I'm still buying..

I'm bullish on BTC. I get it. My only concern is it can't be digital gold because it's not a finite supply.
Someone can just go and make Bitcoin 2.0 with exactly the same tech..or better. 
You can't create more gold.

I understand it perfectly well... Yes that's exactly what I want.
I want someone to try and convince me that crypto is a Terrible idea... I counter their arguments in my head.
it's possible a dedicated bearish channel / website exists and if it does I'd like to frequent it.
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:39:58
30% of my current portfolio and all of remaining fiat that I will invest right now.
It's all relative, it's a stack to me.
I will say I'm still sub 1btc.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:42:18
just bought a stack at 5500 Euro... seconds later it just pumped.. Never have I had such luck!

Just download the revolut app. It's amazing for getting into the crypto markets. Every GDAX deposit I have made has been a SEPA through this app. It's amazing. I also have a hard bank card for it too so when I take profits I just spend them straight from revolut in any country or currency I like.
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:50:25
Thanks! I'll have a watch of them later. A dedicated channel would be ideal so they can put a but of realism on the latest bullish news...
Maybe because a dedicated bearish channel doesn't exist it's a sign there aren't many people who genuinely think it's all going to zero. Or a gap in the market for a YouTube channel!

Ask yourself, are you trying to make a few % more fiat trading BTC or are you wanting to have skin in the game just incase McAfee has to eat his dick.
Then trade accordingly.
There's nothing wrong with taking small profit if that's your goal. If you want to hold your wealth mainly in fiat.
You can buy back in at 8500 sell at 9000 and make another little profit. That is still good trading if that's what your plan is.
Myself however I want to ride the bull run to the dick eating days, so I have learned not to try and short sell - the FOMO will kill you.
HODL that shit.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:01:17
Strange that I buy with absolutely no hesitation or worry but when it pumps and I'm well in the green I'm scared to death to sell.... I fomo real bad. 
I'm hodling til McAfee eats his dick.

What would you prefer me to compare BTC holdings to if not fiat?
Gold? Silver? Black market organs?
I have increased my BTC position by 
1. Buying on the way down and 
2. Trading alts against BTC to gain more BTC. Like a 20% Neo position at 0.0068.
I bought my first BTC at 16k and if I sold everything to fiat now I'd be break even. I am happy with my position.
I wish I understood your critique.
Unfortunately I need to think in fiat as that's what my mortgage company, childcare provider, utility provider ect accept as means of payment.
Where abouts do you live that only accepts crypto as means of payment?

Exactly have a look at the buy and sell prices on revolut. It's not an open market. The buy price is substantially higher than the sell price. Revolut takes a cut.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:19:38
I am very bullish on BTC... I'm concerned though that's I'm too bullish. I need to keep researching into the negative aspects to keep me grounded. 
I need counter arguments to all the great benefits.
