Honestly this is what I am aiming for too. Retiring would be great, but I would just as easily love for an extra $10k in my emergency fund.

My company donates to the United Way each year and is willing to match employee donation. I usually put in $50 but anything extra makes a difference. Below is my wallet if you are interested in that cause: 1A2v7txmQPgTZzR2Ua1iB8qt6m5wMn1kNJ
Here is some proof of how are campaign is doing so far (my company matches 100% of the donation): 
Note sure why I got down voted - this is a great cause that helps entire communities... OP is welcome to donate to them directly, buy we can double the donated amount if done through my employers charitable match program.

I'll make someone a profile picture for 0.35 BTC - that's how much I need to get my kitec plumbing replaced :(

What was your grand parents/parents interest rate? They were so high they doubled the cost of the house. While we pay more now, it's like 2x more not 10. 
Crypto won't succeed anytime soon because even if places accept payment people will be too afraid to spend their speculative investment. It's nice to see all these stores posted here accepting BTC, but at the end of the day its just a sign at a place where people spend fiat.

Is this a adoption?

You are kidding yourself if you think the majority of the people bought into it for the right reasons. We live in a social media world where everyone is lazy and desperate to get rich quick - that is the only reason for the last massive pump.

The biggest challenge is getting people to spend crypto. Everyone is viewing it as an investment and that is the road to failure.
My bags are so small that I dont really care.

Of course not, its crypto - you control your money right?

These guys are so desperate to make it seem like a big deal.
