if you're canadian you can use 
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:05:43
you should never keep large amount of coin on an exchange anyway. it's not a wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:15:51
it does solve it but you can't force an employee to accept bitcoin instead of fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:14:43
this will actually help bitcoin to raise again now that we can move on past this.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:52:02
try coinpayments.net
I use them for my fundraiser: 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:58:54
1) it is mainly targeting businesses so they can clearly fill their taxes.
2) when you bank account suddenly gets a big chunk of money, they'll know LOL
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:05:37
and your assumption is that there's no other search engine in the world LOL... focusing on Google's practicing is missing the point. 
My point was to do your research before investing. If you have a bone to pick with Google that's not my problem
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:30:23
nothign stopping them, but it would be a large scale operation and totally illegal. it would be a clear act of thievery they would ruin them
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:53:48
yes having your books reflect proper employment is a separate issue from your question and yes you need to keep it legal otherwise you'll be in trouble with your local goverment
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:33:08
so you realise the amount of transaction made daily at gox?? going back 2 years would involve months of research and hundreds of people... who would pay them for all that work? its not a realistic option
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:48:38
how much you looking to buy??
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:18:06
I start the bidding war at 1 Satoshi
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:23:52
not brilliant, desperate to be relevant and fail at reporting accuracy. The Satoshi account on P2P Foundation known to be the real person/group already mane a post, firs tin 3 years stating they have the wrong guy lol

bitcoin for dummies and beginner's guide 101, don't keep large amount of coin on exchange, keep it on a local wallet when you have control of what happens to it.
this has barely no impact on bitcoin it's like saying email will stop working because hotmail shuts down.
for months everybody knew to stay away from mtgox because it's impossible to get fiat out. it's a small bump in the road and will force all other exchanges to bulk up their security and have better public ledgers.
No one's allowed to complain about lost in a high risk unregulated market. It's like spending $800 on the death of superman in the 90s and complaining they brought him back 3 months later lol
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:13:28
I never say no to a free lunch... why not!
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:53:21
until we know what the whole story is, we should hold on judging him. Don't be like all the bitcoin hate in the government and financial market
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:25:27
You can is you buy CryptoScratchCards from 
You register as a reseller, bulk order redeemable cards that you can sell on ebay or your own site. people can pay with paypal and since you're selling an actual physical products, you have full protection against scammy chargebacks!
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:59:36
again, they have to implement the features (which no one in the community will) and them release a new client (which no one will use) and they will be stuck in their own fork
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:16:34
that what I'm saying too! he guy has a 190IQ... so if this was him plan, he'll have an exit plan too! he wouldn't stick around try to fix things, file for bankruptcy and do a press conference
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:01:45
ok, one side note.... they guy a a 190 IQ, if we just wanted to steal the coins he would have done it better than this
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:08:43
I'm Gman and a cold hearted SOB, I understand the risk of playing in a high risk unregulated market for profit. I understand that I shouldn't invest more that I'm willing to lose and I understand that an exchange is not a wallet. Why keep to much in the exchange if you ain'T gonna buy or sell?
I do understand how much hate mail I'll be receiving.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:37:49
the American tax thing? sucks to be in that country
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:54:43
You can use Interac, I know it's not a CC but at least no direct bank transfer nor verification
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:49:27
how did you see it? the site is down :P
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:50:36
people fianlly moved on the Gox fiasco and BTC is getting back to normal
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:21:47
Touching the blockchain will make bitcoin useless and kill it.
Also, this will open the door to even more scam knowing they can just reverse it.
People need to stop whining like babies, this is high risk financial trading, if you don't have the backbones to play in this world, stay home!
it's like going to vegas with $1M and complaining the games favor the house... people knew what they were getting into and if they didn't they are idiots for not researchign it properly.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:08:06
No they wont. Unless they hack you computer/phone to get your wallet address, then you can track the content of the address but it's easy to create a new address and stop using the old one.
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:21:01
Anybody investing in bitcoin have the skill to Google search a wiki page, someone investing blindly is just a stupid person. there's no need to promote everything that went wrong with it when it's publicly archived and documented.
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:09:52
Colored coin was a great concept to help people categorized investments, gifts, purchase etc... Congress want to use it to track "bad ones"
at the end of the day congress can't do shit. If they make their own fork, no one will join in LOL
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:48:15
have fun suing someone in a different country specially after filing for bankruptcy :P
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:55:42
Yeah because he's the sole employee of the company controlling every aspect of it! Wall Street and Citi Bank does worst everyday and no one complains and no one target 1 specific individual, how is this different?
@_date: 2014-07-29 02:56:56
Forget about any hardcore bitcoin fan comments and see it as it's most simplistic core: there's no money for them in it. If they can't control it, they can't profit. They don't want you to have an easy, convenient and cheap way to do banking, as simple as that :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:34:58
ha! I know but there,s a difference between shady ops and black ops and the setup of a branch of government for the sole purpose of stealing from the worlds
