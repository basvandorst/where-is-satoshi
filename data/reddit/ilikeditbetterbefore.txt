I have the Asian Markets on separate clocks on my computer because it's like... yeah... a pattern.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:27:46
I was under the impression that most people had a good bit more than that invested... otherwise, yeah, why care...
If your exposure isn't even .5btc, then... uhh... who cares. Set your stops at the �� for sell, and retain 33% for "Stars"... then stops for buy in the dips, and the dips within dips... and if you really want to be busy, then yeah, try to it trade actively to gain... but, good luck. Time in a B&amp;H and added via DCA would have done me more good than trading in most cases. Don't sell to buy... just buy... that's what I got from historical.

Let's see... first, you called me a "n*gger"... because I joked about the value tanking, and then the next day it did... then you try to use big words like "denigrating" in a phrase that literally makes no fucking sense at all...
...so why are you talking to me?
Seems like you should be sicking my duck... nagger.

Hold 0.1 of anything over $1000, and put $100 into anything under $1... get at least 1000 of anything in the .00001-3  range, and 250-500 of everything above that up to the .0003... buy into &gt; 30% dips, and then, set super low pre-spring stop buys, and, (~33% holdings /partial ) "completely insane" profit Stop sells... wait... log off, come back in 2 years... and see how it went.
Whatever you do... do NOT have Stop Loss... just consider the money gone... stop loss is the best way to miss the boat in the long run...

We've been awake for at least since our alarms sounded the fall of the mighty... and, we have stop buys in place for just this sort of thing. :)

Could open up an E*Trade account and short the hell out of the futures... always good to hedge your bets... but then if you think Crypto is difficult to learn, try Options trading. ��

Your face is an embarrassment.
Also, normal healthy adults don't really give a shit what other people do, think, or say... about them, or, really anything else... especially on the internet.
Go cry somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:10:30
...I didn't. 
Because it was $1,600-1,700 each on Coinbase, sometime around, IDK, August... and pre-fork I got the FUD about shifting from ETH to BTC, so I didn't. Seemed like it was still expensive from when I started trading, and I wanted to wait until it was under $1.25K...
So I sat on 12.5 ETH, and 15 LTC, and 2750 XEM... which, I sold December 5th... instead of 3 days later. :|
...and now I regret everything... Didn't consolidate into BTC, sold everything else too soon... missed the �� by a few miles... now I'm FOMOing at the mouth for some big dips, but the BTC I did end up with from XEM has done ok...
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:27:22
I went through all that back in May... pissed me off then also... but I got in before the insane rush... now is like "just when I feel like I've seen it all..."
The lesson is "Buy the dips, when they're actually dips..." the 20% down after a 1000% gain in a week, that's not a dip... 50+% down, that's a dip... but... if you don't have money on both sides of the volatility, then you're gonna have a bad time. 
"Stops" are either your best friend, or your worst enemy... you need to have money to buy in lower, yet the long holdings to keep set "insanely high" sells... because that's why you're here, right... 
So selling right when the rocket is 1000' off the platform will leave you saying... "Well, that was stupid."
Ask me how I know.

My phone sounded the death knell and I watched it dip from 14,000 to 10,500, and back up again... now what... 12.8-13K
...but really I let my stops handle GDAX. Because I was too busy on Polo making moves with the ALTs... need to gobble up some cheap alts while I can... set the stops up and down, executed more trades today than I had all week... it... was... awesome.
Let's go again! That was fun!
Volatility is like, when you're driving, and you hit that dip that makes you "lose your stomach". So fun... some people hate that feeling I guess... but I love it.

Wow, I'm guessing you're not in America... which is why you're still alive and not the cover of another "SWATTED: Police shoot unarmed autistic man with multiple fake bombs chained to his body... after over 9,000 calls from frantic middle-aged white women pour into the County 911 Dispatcher." headline news story.
I mean, it's a real subtle thing... and I don't think the masses are ready for it... but then we're all in for the risk and volatility, and obviously it doesn't always end in a bloodbath... maybe we'll see some green yet.

Remember when O was hodling ETH and LTC, and BTC was trading down to $1600 and I thought.., "You know,,, I could sell everything I have and get like, 3-4 BTC,,,"
Instead, I took a minor profit, and sat on cash waiting for a dip I wanted to buy into... It never came.... Then, I see a buy op coming up, but it was my son's birthday... Dec 7th, so I wasn't paying attention... 
Oops... ������

For another example, unrelated, but you seem like you'd know where to point me...if you were working with multiple free-form text fields per record, over millions of records, against a dynamically categorized index of thousands of dimensions combined in various ways, that then looks for patterns it determined can exist, in the unknown records... which is then used to categorize these records based on hits of one thing vs another adding up to one category more than another... what is this process called? 
I'm looking into organizing a new MDM and DFD and ERD to (document) streamline this process into something nice and clean, and most importantly, automated...
I should probably mention... a 2GB Query Limit, and a 32-bit program version.

The wave went parabolic for my first ride... and it did it rather unexpectedly as I was standing there with a wad of cash in my hand, attempting to get on, and then it rose up... and up... and up... until it blocked the sun... and I heard screams from the top... *MOOOOOOOONN!!!*
...so I paddled over to the tide-polls, and threw pebbles into the anemones...
From a distance I watched it crash down in slow motion, with lots of people saying they knew why, and where the ground was... but they'd all been staring at the sun too long thinking it was the moon... and their waxen wings dripped down their backs, into the frothy seas below... some had started jumping... then more... and more... and they dragged themselves over to the pools... "OMFG, did you see that shit?! It was so high... but I'm gonna wait for the dip, so I can ride back up to where I bought in..."

I see this debacle as sort of... IDK, arguments over how to enhance technology / code from 11 years ago... essentially.
It's like, right or wrong on one point or another, not touching it is a terrible idea, but so is bad touch...
It's like when Apple removed the headphones Jack, and the notch... and the insane prices, with FOXXCONNNN is in the background with nets around high buildings...
Scams? Well...
I mean, can a technology that doesn't maintain value, because it never improves, or too slowly, or in a myopic way be viewed as a scam? Or is it just bad for business...
Competition is healthy... losing value sucks, but your iPhobe 3GS also lost value, but it wasn't a "SCAM".
I think you do have to totally separate the value props for the Techs, the Specs, and the... IDK, necks...

Wait, why does Blockstream determine what happens with BTC, and the Tech applications of a Peer-to-Peer, DECENTRALIZED... Electronic Currency, and get to leverage their pride and spite against historically competing ideas, just because they were historically competing ideas, and not their precious LN?
Every Tech eventually fails, so will LN.
...but seems to me that at some point if there is a need to do something other than LN, that decision should be made by the individuals using it, and the solution won't need debate. It will just be obviously needed, and they can just update the tech and not fork at all... just make it better over time, as needed, as demand dictates... except, not via any one central authority. Which... IDK, sounds like if Blockstream makes Success or Failure of the Currency, then they are the Fed, and the currency is not decentralized.

Technically it did go up, and stay up. 
It just didn't stay as high as some would have liked, but if someone were looking to buy back in, it's not cheaper than it was before the boom... but it's a lot cheaper than the ATH.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:41:11
...to all the people talking about the BTC "Crash" as if it's the only thing crashing right now... you do pay attention to other, IDK, arguably "Global" Markets... right...
Like, for example... IDK... that guy Dow Jones... what a moron. 
Biggest crash in history yesterday... now, IDK about you, but I'd guess that some of the crash of the magic internet money might have had to do with people shifting to buy the dip to hodl some of Mr. Jones coins... because he obviously shit the bed... and when he keeps blowing it out, they'll keep buying... but when that bottom comes... Grandma will finally realize the jig is up, and then she will want to put her 401k somewhere...
...buy Alts, cause you don't even know... Crypto has to make me money over 3-5 years... not 3-5 days.

It's gonna be next gen coins that aren't related to the "rising tide" and that gains based on the use-case of shifting power away from the tiresome amd contrived collapses of the global economy... 
When we all sign up, business and industry will follow the money, and the power flips... back to the mob. Which is either really great, or incredibly terrifying... 
We should probably stop being "Consumers" and be more intelligent about what purchasing power gives, and how we can "put our money where our mouths are" to change the dynamics of 'value of things' to represent something meaningful rather than chasing fleeting trends that rapidly lose value, or break, but certainly clog landfills and basements...
Think Heirloom materials and craftsmanship that is locally sourced, and for anything you need that won't work that way, buy it used... like with tech, hobby items, cars, clothing... but always trade for items that are timeless, high quality, and reject the Mall culture... let it die.
Then when Amazon rules the world with its Prime fist, Jeff will accept our Crypto and around the world we'll hear the worker's shout "Pay me XEM or pay me nothing because I quit!"
...also, we take down the IRS with civil disobedience once all the workers unite to demand no further withholding under a tyrannical government...

Yeah, they could just post a meme and create infighting to tank the price and generate a couple forks, and then malign both sides as shills, while slowly selling off at 2500% profit from their original arrest of the guy who made it big first... oh, and I am Tokidoki... and this is my vision.
