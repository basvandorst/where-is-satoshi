Right. This is rough calculation and shows only that there are theoretical limits that can not be passed. Also current full blocks are not exactly 1MB, so it will take longer to reach the 1TB.
The point is that if we have bigger block size limit, it will be reached sooner than you think. People are using the blockchain for storing all kinds of data, and if it's cheap and immutable and will be there forever, its makes sense to fill it all no matter if it's 2, 8 or 20 MB per block.

* The network produces on average 144 blocks for 1 day and each block is maximum 1 MB in size, so we have 144MB or 0.144GB each day.
* The blockchain is currently about 93G in size, so we have 907GB to fill.
907/0.144 = ~6300 days from now = [March 2, 2034](
The same calculation for 2 MB blocks:
907/0.288 = ~3150 days from now = [July 17, 2025](

Also electricity costs depends on location (ambient temperature) and price per KW/h. 
S9 has power consumption of ~1400W, so total consumption of 171,583 machines will be 171,583 * 1400 W = 240,216,200 W or ~240,216 KW. 
Cheapest electricity price i found is 0.03 $/KWh, so 240,216 KW * 24 hours * $0.03 = **$173K per day** to run the miners.
Electricity price in my country is 0.12 $/KWh, so it will cost me about $692K to run all the miners for a day :)

If now we have 92,262 MB of blockchain data in 441587 blocks, that means the average block size is 92262 / 441587 = ~0.209 MB per block.
 If all blocks since the [genesis]( were 100% full (1MB each) we would have 441587 MB (441.58GB) of data.
The doubling you are talking about is a result of newer blocks getting full and it looks like an exponential growth, but in fact it's capped by 1MB block size limit and can only grow linear.

What about the number of inputs/outputs? I think a lot of businesses need compact transactions with many outputs.

You CAN create smart contracts (programs) on Bitcoin! Yeah, much more simpler, but much, much more secure.

Can SegWit be implemented without the discount for witness data? If yes, then the discount itself is the compromise.
SegWit is a very smart solution for a very complex problem.

Is Bitcoin ready? We have a long way ahead and LN is a step forward.
