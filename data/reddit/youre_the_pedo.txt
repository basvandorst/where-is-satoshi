How can you claim bitcoin has been a successful experiment? You obviously haven't been paying attention.
The history of bitcoin is basically a non-stop string of scams, failures, and general despair. The only way you could consider it to be a success is that some people still haven't sold.
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:37:54
I actually thought this was satire.
Congrats on becoming a parody of yourselves.
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:34:30
The code is mediocre. The protocol even more so.

Everyone has heard of bitcoin by now, if they aren't using it they're not interested. 
Please stop harassing people.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:45:42
Nah.  
@_date: 2014-10-27 07:20:38
Look Daddy! I'm a real trader! 
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:14:55
That's a very creative use of the word 'major'.
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:28:14
Definitely worth it!
@_date: 2014-05-01 00:44:45
It's normal for the price to fluctuate wildly. Bitcoin's value is derived pretty much from speculation alone, so it is very sensitive to bad news. Also, as more and more people get bored or burnt by how user-unfriendly it is and sell, the price drops.
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:56:20
Never. This is a design feature in the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:27:09
This is a great way to lose friends.  
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:59:25
My advice depends on how much you enjoy being scammed. 
 Considering you're a bitcoiner, I'm guessing a lot?
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:51:47
American libertarians hate being told this.
@_date: 2014-12-23 13:46:19
Microsoft don't touch bitcoins. 
Besides, every bitcoin transaction is public, and researchers have been able to link addresses with ip addresses, they wouldn't need Microsoft to do this.  
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:18:51


Can you explain how you believe addresses with zero transactions fit in the bitcoin protocol?
@_date: 2014-04-29 01:03:34
Governments love it when people attempt to exploit loopholes!
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:19:57
You're absolutely right, it's suspicious that an intelligent girl would be interested in bitcoin.

Your siblings unborn child resents you already.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:45:42
Actual comparisons between the early internet and bitcoin are few and far between. Pretty much everything about the early internet bitcoiners claim is revisionist propaganda to encourage people to buy more.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:22:21
What do you think? 0.25 bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:15:21
Jealously mostly.
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:38:40
Fewer and fewer people buying and selling is good for bitcoin because...

Are you citing any foundational work on whether Beanie Babies are currency or not?
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:46:29
I'm here for the same reason everyone else is: to discuss bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:22:32
If your coins are stolen, can't you just ask the bank for a chargeback?

@_date: 2014-05-14 02:23:08

You'll get a small fraction back and you'll like it. Caveat emptor!

Once they know I got rich quick they're bound to respect me!
@_date: 2014-04-29 06:09:37
Don't worry, they'll all be worthless soon and then it will be like you haven't lost anything at all!
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:21:08
Why don't you do it? 
@_date: 2014-06-09 07:23:49
Screw them and the useful service they provide!
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:08:18
Dude. You are in a cult. I know you don't realise it, but look at what you are doing.
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:53:36
Great idea! How can I send you one cent? Is it possible to tip less? 
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:02:04
I'll just sell before that point and make a tidy profit.
@_date: 2014-05-30 08:57:57
Consumers don't like using bitcoin for online purchases because they have no protection and no recourse if the seller rips them off.
@_date: 2014-07-06 11:08:04
I don't see what the argument is about. NewEgg don't accept bitcoin, they accept dollars from an intermediary.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:17:30
Pretty sure startups want money, not bitcoins.

What made you choose to have. the symbol for Thai baht tattooed on your arm?

Oh wait, bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:30:43
Run as far from r/bitcoin as you can if you want sane, unbiased, rational advice.
This place resembles a cult more and more every day. Everything is good news and it is never a bad time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:09:34
Are you suggesting Satoshi made a mistake?
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:35:37
That's because bitcoiners are greedy.
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:58:25
Why do your t-shirts have the Thai baht logo on them?
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:02:01
What a colossal waste of our planet's finite resources. Simply indefensible.
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:55:41
People know what bitcoin is these days, that excuse no longer flies. 
Bitcoin is still a poorly implemented protocol. It's interesting, sure, but it has very limited application in the real world.
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:09:02
Volume is the lowest it's ever been.
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:16:47
It's still proceed in USD everywhere though?
@_date: 2014-12-31 08:06:33
Will you buy a bitcoin off me for $500 then? Since that's what they're worth according to you.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:33:01
Not really. The problem is that all bitcoin discussion forums are full of bitcoiners, who are, by definition, not very intelligent and incredibly gullible.
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:53:37
Unique address used is a meaningless number and incredibly easy to manipulate, and if you knew anything about bitcoin you would know that. 
If a address was as hard to open as a bank account you would have a point, instead you have an embarrassing lack of understanding.
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:15:42
Just to be clear, you're advocating charitable donations to profitable enterprises in the hope they decide to not screw you over?

"Bad news = good news"
Is this a two-dimensional chess analogy?
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:44:31
It's to be expected in r/bitcoin when your opinion is anything but 'to the moon'.
@_date: 2014-05-18 06:30:31
Actually bitcoin is mostly a older crowd, they just seem like children.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:45:57
It's because the price exists only in the minds of true-believers.
@_date: 2014-10-27 06:04:11
What makes you think there isn't ten such bots keeping the price above $10?
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:41:01
I can't see how it's fair to force them to acquiesce to others.  It's their product, they can do what they want.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:07:56
Literally everyone who doesn't buy bitcoins is me.
@_date: 2014-12-26 12:15:46
Wow, source? 
@_date: 2014-12-21 07:28:56
Kinda makes you feel euphoric right? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:50:05
Just do a chargeback?
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:34:52
Many many people trying to sell bitcoins asap.
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:10:31
That's because anyone who doesn't join the circlejerk is banned or shadowbanned now. This is a place for pumping only!
@_date: 2014-04-30 07:01:32
Currently bitcoin is orders of magnitude harder to acquire and use than fiat money. it seems difficult to see that it will ever take off without a massive improvement.
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:36:22
Welcome to the PUMP ZONE.
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:44:36
This seems like the most plausible explanation.
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:59:28
Hardly an ATM.  It's more like a vending machine with opening hours.  Cute though.  
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:43:38
What about a service that converts bitcoin to real money ASAP? 
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:32:35
Bitcoin solves a problem the vast majority of people don't have and will never have.
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:02:37
Great job! 
Anyone contributing to the falling price should be banned so they don't infect potential investers. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:52:49
Do you ever wonder why people call bitcoin a pump and dump scam?
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:28:52
The amazing thing is that this isn't even the dumbest thing I've read on r/bitcoin this week.  
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:02:21
Do you realise this planet only has finite resources? Everything you've suggested is a colossal waste of energy.
@_date: 2014-12-26 13:00:26
Is this the college game played on a baseball field? Pretty sure anyone who watches this kind of niche event already knows when it's on so the fact they screwed up like this is inconsequential.

Most people find this insulting actually.  
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:49:19
Because they'll control the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-04 15:13:40
Can't I just send it to someone else like email? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:14:02
Literally a referral scam.
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:19:48
Do you guys even just sit there and think 'we're going to be so rich'? Sometimes it kinda floors me just how wealthy some of us will be soon.
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:42:53
GHash will still have the advantage of controlling the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-09 10:36:10
My tea leaves concur with your analysis.
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:46:45
Pools can lie about their identity though, so putting any restriction is useless.
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:22:03
You have to be incredibly gullible to use these machines though.  Huge fees and massive invasion of privacy.  
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:27:11
It's still an insane amount of energy for not much gain.
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:31:22
This will never be not funny.
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:52:48
It's actually good for bitcoin when you do this as it demonstrates one of the best features of bitcoin.  You can just leave money sitting there for a specific person to collect and you can easily get the money back of they don't take it or you change your mind.

@_date: 2014-05-26 23:37:12
Definitely. Just keep trying to pump it up, we need more people to buy and keep buying. 
Don't take no for an answer from your friends and family either, if everyone plays their part and buys buys buys we'll all be very wealthy by the end of the year!
