But people keep bitcoins on an exchange because they are trading... having them in a wallet is something different, it is a different usage of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:58:54
But people keep their BTC on an exchange because they are trading them... this is a solution for a different problem, when you just want to store your BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:45:51
But you can't do trading from it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:34:01
Maybe not, I don't know. I just wanted to point out, that the PSA applies only to those who do not trade, and just want to store bitcoin. For traders it is nearly useless.
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:30:39
How do you do trading when the BTC is in your own wallet? (But I agree that it is not wise to use exchange just for storing your BTC.)
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:04:30
But BTC exchanges are used for TRADING bitcoin, not STORING them. Paper wallet is not solving this use case.
Also, maybe I did something wrong, but in the past I did have paper wallets, and I wasn't at peace that much... now and then I also worried if someone will not simultaneously steal that physical thing, whether the password will still work, etc. Mostly irrational fears, I know, but I honestly doubt this a good solution for most people. It felt like having a piece of physical gold hidden somewhere in the house... some people are comfortable with that, others are not.
I believe the correct way is that bitcoins will be stored online, but with insurance.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:43:52
The BitGo URL already works!
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:10:00
Maybe not, although I think some things can be predicted to a much large degree of probability compared to the risk. Anyway, I still think that the advice "invest only what you can comfortably loose" applies only to middle/higher class people who have such money. By that logic, other people couldn't enter, even if they are convinced that crypto will go up.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:03:54
This is a bit unfair. You are technically right, but there are a lot of people, who doesn't have that much (or no) money which they can "comfortably losing"... those people would then be left out of this unprecedented opportunity. My friend also took a loan and bought 20 BTC when they were $450... he didn't feel much comfortable about it, but took the risk, which paid off. 
tl;dr: This is easy to say if you have enough money which you can comfortably loose.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:17:50
Irrelevant for you, but clear and non-confusing branding is actually very important for adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:41:44
Yes, I believe it is still worth to invest in bitcoin.
Honestly, I think your feeling of regret is totally futile. Why? You did not invest in BTC back then, since you didn't believe it will go up. Now you are basically in the same situation, you are not sure if it will go up, so it feels like a risk to invest. Don't blame yourself, even if you had invested back then, maybe you would constantly worry whether you will not loose your money, or you could even buy high and sell low. It is not that easy to hold bitcoin in such a state of mind.
I would suggest to learn more about crypto, and then invest into those you really believe will keep or increase it's value. For example, I hold some BTC and ETH, and looking at a few other coins.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:03:09
Yes, but a lot of people consider BTC something like a gold...as a long-term investment and a store of value. Also, what I watched in the past was that when the price of BTC skyrocketed, people traded their alts back to BTC to some degree (although this effect might be less strong in the future).
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:26:59
He only said that he wants to explore blockchain technologies... And which Winklevii ideas do you mean? Their only BTC idea is that BTC is like gold, and it is good to buy it and hodl. It's a good idea, I also followed it, but there is nothing to steal, though.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:16:28
Why it didnt add anything? If someone stoles your password, he still cant login, since 2FA will block him...
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:15:28
I only guess here, but if they periodically cashed out to fiat for example, then it is considered a business activity and should be registered. But hard to say.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:25:55
Be fair. This happened to him once, otherwise it was rather good and candid interview.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:10:11
Thanks for explanation, but as other commenter pointed out - doesnt this remove fungibility? And without fungibility, isnt it then just a token, not currency?
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:55:32
It means exactly what the sentence says. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:27:51
He borrowed from a bank, it was a normal loan.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:25:19
Yes buy you can create a wallet out of it, or what is brain wallet then?
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:13:50
There is similar thread on You entered 2FA on the phishing site, and you didnt' have 2FA on your email account. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:27:44
One small positive about this Roger attack is that Lightning development appears to move much faster than before. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:14:55
He had, but entered the code into the phishing site.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:37:06
I do not endorse it, I even challenged him whether he is sure to do that, but I still think it is not gambling, if you are convinced based on facts, that the adoption (and this value) will go up.
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:18:23
After reading about those robs at Binance, I would also add:
1) You are not entering your email password when logging to an exchange.
2) 2FA code is not asked for twice in a row.
3) You must have 2FA also on your email account, not only on exchange: that way even if someone logins to your exchange account, he shouldn't be able to withdraw, since he will not be able to confirm the withdraw.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:17:05
And didn't have 2FA on his gmail, otherwise the attacker still couldn't login there.
But let's not blame the OP, the community needs to do more to educate people.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:26:52
Ok. I just wanted to say, that Mark's words are hyped up here... he didn't say he backs cryptocurrency as the title says.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:23:43
Mark could get richer instantly by creating FacebookCoin. He even doesn't need blockchain, he could just maintain the ledger on his server, and integrate his coin into his websites and apps. People would buy it anyway. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:36:49
But what you mean by "again".
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:23:57
Yes, I see that as well, but the question remains if this will continue long-term or not.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:05:40
Nothing that good, but if fiat value of your holding will grow more in btc than in ltc, and you dont do that many transactions, then you dont mind those feeds that much. Basically, fees are only one property of the coin.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:35:17
Aren't bid/ask prices set by traders? I don't know about Robinhood, but other crypto exchanges certainly do not work like when you exchange one fiat to another in a bank.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:35:39
In my understanding, brain wallet is secure when you do something like this: take some wordlist, for example bip-39 which is 2000 words, and then use dice to randomly choose 24 words from that list. But in a practical sense, I still see it nothing more as an exercise, you just buy HW wallet instead.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:41:17


If you enter the 2FA code to the phishing site first, then yes... :-D
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:51:49
It is ok. Received mine today.

I still own some fiat for such things. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:04:52
But if you don't want to "stream" money, that there will never be billion of transactions per second. If there will be 1 billion BTC users, average could be like hundreds of transactions per month?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:29:40
But miners would not agree and they could just not deploy it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:05:07
Thank you, but I do know how mining works, I spent about 1 month to actually study the bitcoin source code, a few years back. Also, my parent comment was correct, despite being downvoted.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:41:12
On Binance for example, you can buy all their altcoins with ETH.

It is easy to say, but what if the kidnappers just don't release you?

I don't know Bittrex, but OP didn't show any evidence, basically.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:35:42
The problem is elsewhere - that he wants BCash to be called Bitcoin, and undermine the BTC. Nobody would say anything, if he named his coin BCash, or anything else not containing the word "Bitcoin". Nobody says they are not innovating.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:01


People taking up loans are basically small investors, they will not move the price that much. And those big investors probably knows what they are doing. Anyway, aren't you jealous a bit? My former colleague also took loan, and bought 20 BTC for $450. What's so wrong about it? If the price will stay lower for a long time, he would have to repay the loan with his salary. But somehow that didn't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:37:46
It is perfectly fine to fork... but that second thing should be renamed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:21
Why Bitcoin "Core"? It is Bitcoin, always was. If Roger doesnt like when people rename Bitcoin Cash to Bcash (I am actually not one of them), why he tries to rename Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core? It is just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:58:31
I still think if you fork yourself from a SomeCoin, you should not be allowed to call it SomeCoin Cash and promote it as SomeCoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:04:57


The problem is elsewhere - why the exchange doesn't say this to him then. The problem is that they don't communicate, not that it takes longer time.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:36:52
Depends what you mean by "fails". 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:38:12
Better analogy would be that BCash is larger truck, which can carry more transactions. It doesn't claim it is faster, but can load more goods at once.
(I don't support Bcash and I also think their solution is only temporary, but still OP's analogy doesn't work IMHO).
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:48:50
With recent influx of new users to each exchange, it is also very well possible that they just cant handle the demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:16:59
IMHO this is not a fair question, since cryptocurrencies are used by only a small fraction of people.
I think we can just admit that the PoW algorithm is wasteful regarding the computing resources. It is a necessity since it works exactly that way, but obscuring this fact is useless.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:39:53
I think his point was, that a lot of very rich people - majority I would say - still work, even they don't need to.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:29:36
Around 2013, I spent about one month to study bitcoin code, I still remember how it took me like a half of Saturday until I finally understood the PoW algo. Then I realized, that to built something on top of bitcoin technology isn't that trivial.
Then I also mined DOGE for fun, posted memes and ultimately sold it to BTC with some profit.
Fastforward a few years, I just hodl some btc and eth in hardware wallet, and as people on 4chan use to say, "feel comfy af".
TL;DR: What else is there to do with the coins, anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:17


But that is only because miners are competing, it is not that more transactions require more energy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:29:40
But why does he calls Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core"? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:25:34
So there are about 24 blocks with 25.xx bitcoins, in a ~58 hours range. What makes you to believe it is ghash, apart from the fact that the estimated hashrate is quite high (around 7%)?
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:25:33
Maybe they do, but does that mean they should work for free on btc and slowly use up that stash for a living?
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:07:45
It is only your opinion that we dont need turing complete language inside transactions. I believe somebody should try it so we will all see if it works and what are the possibilities. I think it is not possible to assess whether the idea is viable until we see the working system. 
Tldr: doesnt look like a scam to me, the main idea is valid. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:27:15
You did answer, but it is questionable that this can be called a mixing. It is safe only if you suppose authorities will not get logs from those exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:45:02
I don't know Oleg, but this is a very sensible answer. 


Exactly this. Ghash said in January, that 45% of their hashing power is made of their own hardware, and since they have around 40% of the global hashrate, it means that they own up to 20% of the total working mining hardware. If one company can buy 20% over a few years, why someone else can't buy 51%? Of course, the answer is it can, Oleg is precisely right on this. So ghash doesn't matter longterm, since we have to wait until the hashrate will be so high it will be more unfeasible for one party to get a majority.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:50:27
So if other pools have been cooperating and sharing knowledge for so long, how it is possible ghash is the best?
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:43:28
Yes, but only if you do it on a computer not connected to the internet, which from that point on will never be connected to an internet. Otherwise, there could be potentially some malware, which stored those 12 words and then will send them to the adversary.
Or, at least that my definition of "cold" - that private part will never be on a computer connected to the internet.
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:21:50
Which are those?
@_date: 2014-07-21 05:49:55
I don't agree with your second sentence. They do, at least from the marketing and raising awareness perspective. I believe I didn't miss the point, I just happen to disagree with it.

Shorter block time. I am an impatient person, and being able to transfer my funds in 6 minutes instead of 60 feels so much better. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:41:39
No. For example if there is a speculative bubble in gold, it is something different, since gold will always have certain value, because it has an utility in and of itself. Bitcoin only has an utility if it will not fail as a currency, which the author probably don't believe it will, and then can come to such an conclusion.
For example, I am observing that certain dying altcoins are indeed something like the author describes. Some of the early adopters got rich since they sold when the price was high, and then the price goes down and down towards zero, so those later adopters who can't sell lost money. It is not Ponzi scheme by definition, but something similar (although the name "naturally occurring" Ponzi is confusing imho).
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:50:28
1) other methods are also more or less risky
2) if you want to play those games whales play, you need to have big amounts in your account for daytrading. 
3) lazyness
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:26:57
I do not agree: Proper doc should be a part of the bitcoin software, so it should be done by the development team; especially in a critical project like a bitcoin. Doc should be an integral part of the package, especially for a platform other devs are using. Larry Page already knew that in 1987, when he created Perl.
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:27:38
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:33:39
I agree, this was the only weak line in the video... altcoins prices are so much coupled with BTC that no one from those communities wants troubles for bitcoin (nobody who has a clue what is going on).
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:21:51
Maybe, in this BTC-e context, he meant that it is futile to ask them anything, since they will not bother to answer anyway; they know that their customers will not leave them because of that.
@_date: 2014-06-17 09:55:36
Yes, I did. And the article also mentions double-spend.
But I don't say 51% is not a problem, but in general I mostly agree with what Andreas said on youtube, that those attacks are mostly theoretical - meaning, that they would be successful, if the network would do nothing. But in practice that will not happen, since that attempts are easily spotted. So if we really want to analyse what will happen at 51%, the analysis should also contain some guesses regarding how quickly such attack will be spotted, and what the rest of the network (and also miners in that pool) will likely do - not just suppose, that all other entities would continue to act as if nothing is happening.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:56:43
MCXNow - Yes, they actually have far less coins...and then volume. I checked just now, and their LTC trading volume is only 65 BTC for 24 hours... so this is basically usable only for occasional single trade.
@_date: 2014-06-13 10:15:30
Look at the Bitcoin Wiki here: 
"block" messages: 13. Reject if timestamp is the median time of the last 11 blocks or before
If they would, for example, mine 24*6=144 private blocks, they can't replace it, even if it is longer, since this rule will prevent that and other nodes will not accept. You can replace maximum of 6 blocks, on average. It is also explained in this article:
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:16:40


Hmm, but if they will be mining empty block (for example), which they will mine with 51% probability, wouldn't those transactions be kept in the transactions pool, and then mined with 49% probability in the next block by the other pools? It looks to me like delaying them, not censoring.


Yes, but any pool can try to do that, and their hashrate will dictate the probability of their success. That's why accepting transactions with very low (or zero) confirmations is not recommended.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:53:42
Why 9 in 10 chance?
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:47:40


Yes, you can, but how did you conclude that it never went over 51%?
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:35:20
But the issue is, that staying with ghash.io even if they reach &gt;50% is only theoretically "acting in a suicidal fashion". You might think it is, I might think it is, another 100 redditors might as well, but it was not proven yet it is suicidal.
@_date: 2014-07-20 09:00:00


I don't agree with the last sentence. When I want to pay with Bitcoin, it doesn't mean that I "don't want it". I want it to be adopted, and I later re-buy the spent Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:03:09


In which way, exactly?
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:41:36
I think he meant PoS or something similar.
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:07:37
But the point is why blame ghash.io for it - by the same logic, this happened because BTCGuild has only 8% and Eligius has only 4%, etc...
@_date: 2014-08-19 12:12:29
Yes yes, I know. The question remains, though, if this difference is something fundamental, or only something which will make this process longer.
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:13:12
But this same logic can be applied to ghash.io, can't be? They would also not gain out of it. My point is, why do you fear ghash.io, when some other company can do the same thing (acquire 51%).
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:36:20
How do you prevent achieving 51%, when you already reached 49%? Should they stop mining for a few hours? Because the chart at blockchain doesn't actually shows the hashrate, but only a number of mined blocks in the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:58:26


But aren't there still the bitcoin transaction fees? That was one of his points, if I pay with cash or credit card, there is no fee for me, I only pay the actual sum.
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:58:02
Maybe they did. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:45:42
From mining, or you will get doges by tips, when you write nice things or would say you are a newbie on @_date: 2014-02-18 09:52:15

Depends of the definition of "die".
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:41:07
Yes, this is what I think will happen to Bitcoin, it will be like Linux; technically superior to other alternatives, but mostly used as an infrastructure or privately by geeks. Then other coins will come up which will be like Windows or OSX - more mainstream and with better PR.  If this is what we want, thats fine. I agree with OP. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:51:32
Drive out competition, especially small startups. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:32:58
Maybe it is considered bad by some people due to the fact, that someone else lost the money. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:11:46
I totally disagree with you. Without PR, bitcoin will never become mainstream. It will end up like Linux - superior technology which some companies and geeks use and are fans of, but mainstream people use other products, those which were marketed to them. 
It actually pains my heart when I see majority of people see it this way. But of course this is also a chance for other altcoins which could take bitcoin technology and put better marketing and pr to it. Then we will see which PR approach is better. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:25:44
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:08:07
Yes, but on the other side, this incident was blown out of proportion. Gox had the withdraw implemented wrongly and some people were stealing their btcs. So they stopped withdrawals and then worked on the fix. In the meanwhile, lot of people were angry at them. Why should this kill them?
@_date: 2014-06-07 10:03:14
Hm but what if most ppl will not come across this scenario themselves?
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:24:31
This is actually a question of who has more authority. If devs would declare a new version an "official one", and majority of users, exchanges, merchants etc. will switch to it, then it doesn't matter what miners would think, and even if those "rebel" miners will own 95% of hashrate, if the other users will consider their fork as the "bad" one, those miners are out of luck. Their blockchain doesn't have value, if all others will say it doesn't.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:26:25
We certainly believe your bad experience, but btce is a big and legitimate exchange... Your experience is not typical. There are huge trading goes on, and their profit on fees is insane; I dont think they have a motivation to kill it. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 07:08:28
Are there some estimates regarding how much of those are dumped to fiat?
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:39:40
Yes, but parent is right. OP shouldnt use coinbase, since his country is not listed and why should he lie? Wikipedia should provide direct btc address for such people. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:54:50
Yes I understand. But it is also understandable to me why they did not choose to do such PR. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:56:25


Because it works? The individuals with knowledge can make money after each mini-dump following the news, and they can "tire" the BTC supporters into giving up on bitcoin. IMHO they are very clear what they are doing.
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:13:14
I use 2010 in my daily work, and evaluated 2013 only shortly at home, so its hard to compare for me. The C++ compiler is always improving, and will be likely more C++11 compliant in VS2013, then there is a better support for creating metro apps, and also 2013 has the new metro look itself (similar to Office 2013, flat icons, etc). Anyway, I think you'll be fine with 2010.

Question: For how long should it control the majority, so the "entire value proposition is lost"? And what is value proposition? I am not saying you are wrong, but there were instances that a pool had 51%, and bitcoin is still keeping its value.

Maybe I am an extreme minority here, but I invested quite a lot (relative to my overall wealth) to both Bitcoin and Dogecoin, I want both to succeed, and I am serious about all "that staff" you are mentioning, even if I own quite a few doges.
Although of course the crypto technology was provided by Bitcoiners, and Dogecoin could show more gratitude for that, basically the core invention was created by the Satoshi himself, and all coins have it...bitcoin isn't technologically superior to other coins, and it is even not possible in the open-source environment.
So, what distinguishes one coin from another then? I would argue that it's 90% marketing... how do you build your community and how do you market yourself is what makes the coin success or failure. And this is why I only invested in Bitcoin and Dogecoin so far - they are basically only coins which take marketing seriously, and between those, I even feel Dogecoin has the best and more professional marketing than all other crypto. Yes - you may feel I am joking - but I really think Dogecoin has the most professional marketing, it just takes somewhat another form Bitcoin uses.
And here I feel that certain Bitcoin people (maybe a minority) seems to be a little bit nervous - that they can be theoretically out-marketed by other coins, because apart from marketing, there also isn't anything intrinsically different in Bitcoin. For example, some guy wrote in another thread how Bitcoin will help Philippians workers located overseas to send their salaries home with lower fees than banks - fine, great, that's why we are working hard to make crypto a success. But honestly, if Dogecoiners will not lose steam, those workers can also send the salaries in Doges in the same manner in the future.
Therefore I think what Bitcoin should do is to learn thing or two from Dogecoin, like for example how to improve attitude towards newbies, how to better encourage spending, etc.

Maybe just that SecondMarket guy was right after all? (Wall Street money flowing to btc)
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:30:28
For now, superior protocol, for most prople, is fiat money and banks. What I want to say is, that without centralized marketing, bitcoin will stay as it is, it will be used by several companies and geeks.  
What I hope is that people serious about marketing will take bitcoin source code and launch a new coin (with the same protocol), and then market it to mainstream society. So technologically it will be Satoshi-like crypto, but with different, mainstream-compatible culture. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:24:02
No. My friend sent them money in thrusday and bought cheap btc today. People just continue using their service. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 10:31:59
It will also stop a lot of ordinary people, who would otherwise try it, but will not bother after they learn it is not legal. So it will slow down mainstream adoption, as one downvoted comment already said. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:02:03


Other miners and other pools. Other pools can increase their hashrate (in absolute numbers, for example by buying additional hardware), and that will limit other pools, including ghash.io.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:24:43
Why government? Why not the community?
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:41:57
Yes, that's true. If you do not show a good enough understanding of the technology in the bitcoin-development mailing list, you can get scolded in no time. I am subscribed there and am I studying the code privately, but so far I don't dare to enter yet; the bar to join is set quite high. (I am not complaining about that, just stating my subjective feeling about that group).
@_date: 2014-06-19 08:56:16

Is there some proposed solution for this?
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:36:13
Yes. But I am not sure it is possible with bitcoin - the community just doesnt want that.  It is probably more realistic to do it with a bitcoin clone. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:01:24
But will not the bitcoin transaction fees add up over time? If you will not use the 3rd service which does off-the-blockchain transactions, you will have to pay a fee for each payment you do. While with fiat, either cash or credit card, there is no fee. (ok, there is a fee in certain financial transactions, but most people do those only rarely, while in normal buying, there is none.).
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:51:12

But suggesting like btce is on a brink of collapse is childish. Yes, they are rude, and they are known to be as such, but that's all to it. Many people still trade there and dont care about btce being anonymous. Actually, most of btc exchanges are. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:08:45
But that would breach the contract with the miners, who suppose the pool is functional. Anyway, wouldn't this be just hiding the fact, that they own 51%? This will not decrease the likelihood of the attack scenario, when at the critical time, they would not launch this blocker-script, but instead proceed with the attack. It really achieves nothing.
What I think we need are better competing pools.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:08:34
I think OP used Satoshi's words in an ironic way - what Satoshi said is a problem for conventional currency (trust), is also a problem for bitcoin.

You are right, but what if they are hacked or physically seized? They are entities who would benefit from the non-existence of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:19:30
I remember there was a thread here on reddit, where many people admitted that despite all the technical measures (paper wallet, etc), in the back of their minds there is still some worry about whether the bitcoins arent stolen... This is imho a feature, some people call it a weakness, that once your btc is stolen, you basically cant do anything. 
So there is a need for a service, which acts like a bank, but maintains bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 13:27:23
I agree with you. One little positive thing coming from this incident is that more people will realize, that the current technology is not able to completely protect such digital creations from theft, especially when they aren't properly encrypted. Maybe some people are producing them, not knowing this? Then it is good that they will learn that, and kept safe from potential damage to their lives. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:35:58
I just dont understand, why the large part of bitcoin community is so hostile towards non-bitcoin people or people who just started studying the whole stuff and needs to ask question. 
I supposed it should be just the opposite - bitcoin holders should be happy when someone new wants to enter, since that will increase the overall bitcoin value. 
But this more welcoming mentality  has no chance to taking roots here when even devs doesnt understand this point (and, no need to defend them, I am subscribed to bitcoin-dev mailing list). 
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:50:42

It was a joke, the creators explicitly said that repeatedly. But quite a lot of people wanted the joke to live and went on with it. Despite everything, I still don't think doge will die - surprisingly for many, it is still one of the most established alts. We will see what the future will bring.
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:03:28
You are partially right, but I believe you can't ignore the difficulty adjustment, and especially when it happens.
If really "a ton of miners" suddenly stopped mining, and the hashrate would for example decrease 10x comparing to pre-strike, it would take 10x more time to mine a single block, until the next readjustment, and this can further decimate the trust in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:29:08
But the fact the txid is inconsistent is not intuitively obvious. My friend is also coding an exchange and he admited that he handled the withdrawal the exact same way as gox - he wasnt aware of that one paragraph in the wiki page with the obscure name.

@_date: 2014-05-24 12:16:58
In a figurative sense - in the last weeks, stagnating low price caused some people to lost interest, low buying volume, etc. Now the price increase invigorated the market and interest, and that can be described as a comeback, although the term of course isn't precise in this situation.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:45:52
You are getting downvoted, but I for one agree with you. 
My advice is, look for other coins which understand this point. In Bitcoin it seems centralized PR is unwelcome, the strategy is to not have it.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:33:33
Community can drop ghash.io, but they also own a lot of hardware themselves (cex.io). 
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:50:58
This should be upvoted more. It is exactly as you say - mining is very short-term oriented, since you need to earn as much money as soon as possible, to be able to buy new hardware and thus keep up with the increased difficulty.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:56:08
No, thats not how bitcoin ecosystem works. Whoever wants to use them and at the same time feels that he needs such proof, should seek it. I am not their PR department. I am just their former user, and hadnt had any problems. Now i dont use them any more, but only because I dont trade ltc anymore. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 10:43:48
OP: Might I ask: how do you see the (de)centralization issue regarding the bitcoin development itself? I had been watching the bitcoin-dev mailing list, and my impression was that there is about 15-20 key people, mostly core devs and big pool owners, who basically decide what to implement and how. Does that worry you?
@_date: 2014-04-16 10:56:37
How do you buy (or get) bitcoins, then?
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:14:43
Sorry but I dont think this is possible. You can buy hashes at cex.io and they are bringing you mining profit continuously until you sell. So ghash would need to steal the profit from external miners - but that being the case, those miners would quickly realize they can profit more in other pools. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:26:49
I don't think I understand you. So you speculate that the difficulty will go down? Because if you now operate at a small loss or break-even, and the difficulty will not go down, you can just buy the bitcoins, can't you? I just don't understand how can it "pay off big later" (comparing to just buy and hold bitcoins).
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:33:30
No, you are correct. Bitcoin.de is like a more legalized localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2014-08-19 09:56:24
I don't agree. Currency is used for both.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:58:57
And why exactly do you love to pay with bitcoin? Are those reasons universal enough for more people? 
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:19:28
Buy his main point is correct. It is economically achievable to amass 51% of network hashrate, it is just a moderately difficult task, it seems. So today bitcoin is safe only because no one has the motivation to build 20 farms like this one. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:15:01
Because they want to re-buy at $540.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:22:36
Yes, it isn't easy, but what most people suggest is not an ultimate solution. What if in the future, there will be some completely new player with a lot of hashrate (for example, he invents a new generation of asics and will also manufacture them in a big quantity), who just wouldn't listen to those self-policing requests? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:34:52
Why? Isn't only a number of confirmations and the global network hashrate what matters?
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:40:10


There is NO such knowledge. This never happened. There have been price decreases in the last months, but seems to be unrelated to the ghash's hashrate share.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:31:38
It was not proved yet that mtgox is sinking. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:56:25
There isn't a chance there is that much ASICs for sale. They would have to build the whole ASIC factory and then out-compete the competition and build more hashing power.
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:33:42
No, I think you are not right, since you can't replace arbitrary long blockchain with your private fork, only approximately last 6 blocks.
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:01:17
The problem is, I saw that mainly in the altcoins, that a crypto newbie will make bad investment and lose money, which will go to some more skilled speculator, and that newbie will then leave a crypto-scene for a long time, since he will feel burned. And that's the problem - instead of having more people use crypto, some speculator got rich. It's good for him, but bad for everyone else.

@_date: 2014-02-10 15:51:41
Yes they do have issues, but cryptsy has far larger orders volume comparing to other alt-exchanges. Vircurex and BTER are more quick... if you just need to make a single trade now and then, you can switch, but the trading volume is much lower, just sign up and see for yourself. For daily trading you need cryptsy, IMHO.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:16:12


Yes, but is it such a huge advantage in practice? Bank can't normally steal your money, or at least bank stealing your money is lower probability than someone steals your bitcoins. But the problem is that if you want to own bitcoin, you have to buy it somewhere, and that requires trusting someone. So in practice, currently, buying and owning bitcoin requires more trust than fiat.
@_date: 2014-06-19 08:20:17
No, he is right. His point is, that it doesn't matter that much that ghash has 45%, what matters more is that half of it is their own hardware - which means that one company bought 20% of the whole network hardware; and if one company can own 20%, then 51% is also doable, which makes the network inherently insecure. The security will increase not by ghash's self-restraint, but by the global hashrate becoming much higher than today.
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:13:26
OP says:
*If mining were more distributed, say still CPU mined, then I could tell my sister to install a program and it would generate her a few dollars a month in bitcoin and if it did so reliably, millions of people would sign up.*
I think this approach was already tried with dogecoin. You could mine a few doges on your cpu and a good amount with GPU. And quite a few people indeed tried it, but after a few months, it somehow reached the saturation, and not many new people entered this game. Basically, it worked for some time only, not long-term.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:05:26
Imho, honestly, I don't see much benefit in bitcoin as a consumer. For me, I see the main point as a store of value, which is emmited independenly of governments and financial industry. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:13:31
But it is risky - bot can steal it quicker. Maybe this is the first address they check.
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:26:06
Why do you ask? Do you feel they already did enough to reassure their clients, or such an assurance is not necessary, or do you prefer other, better exchange and would avoid those two?

@_date: 2014-06-20 15:02:14
What did those attack actually do? Had they tried double-spend, or just blocked transactions or the mining process?
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:25:53
We will see. I myself find it strange, that it is not possible to de-anonymize the whole company, which deals with a lot of fiat transfers. I don't know which country's law enforcement do you refer to, but they seems to be either not very competent, or not really getting after them. But who knows, maybe it is really not that easy to find them(?)
@_date: 2014-03-31 08:04:27


Yes, but they will stay cheap for a long time this way... ;-)
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:53:51
I was thinking the same, but doesn't their strategy work due to the fact that they own a lot of mining hardware, which they lease at overpriced amounts through cex.io? Other pools might not have that much capital to copy this strategy, and it can take a lot of time to catch up.
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:00:10
Yes. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:51:45

Wait... do we know how much fiat did they possess, or should have? $5M looks like a big sum, but how much percentage of their total fiat supply was it really?
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:20:24


Why do you think so?
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:34:12


Why not? I think just the opposite is true.


Yes, but if bitcoin will take off, it is expected that there will be a lot of transactions, and also the value of one btc will be higher, so it could be profitable to mine for fees. (at least that's the theory).


Probably not.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:30:10
How can you prevent someone from creating a private btc exchange?
@_date: 2014-09-05 08:05:41
I don't. As I understand how mining economy works, over time only large farms and farms made directly by asic manufacturers will remain profitable. So I don't plan to enter this business.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:04:50


Why if he will just repeatedly deny that it is him? The evidence is only circumstantial. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:31:39
Hm, interesting. Thinking about it further, wouldn't it be best for bitcoin, if more asic manufacturers would create their own pools (like KNCMiner) and just fight each other? It looks the small "amateur" miners will not be profitable anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:17:46
Yes, that's right. But do you know why did I suggest this?
I remember when on January ghash.io reached about 40%, they published a press release, where they admitted that 55% of the pool is their own hardware. That means, that they basically owned 20% of the total network hardware (!). Think about it, if some small obscure company can amass 20% of total mining hardware, then can't some other player gather 50%? I think it can, and I conclude from this, that the total bitcoin network hashrate is not yet high enough to consider bitcoin truly secure. We need much higher global hashrate, and therefore I believe restricting anyone is not a solution. We need to increase non-ghash hashrate, that's the correct way. 
(Or, of course, it would be great if technological solution against 51% would be found.)
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:35:41
But bitfinex add it, for example.
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:12:18
That wouldnt make it less avkward. What value would bitcoin have without commercial adoption?
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:13:15
But would you be able to react this way if you had thousands of btcs there and you wouldnt know if you will ever see them anymore? For some strange reason, people like to store large amounts of money there. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:27:16
That is fine, if it is clearly marked as an advertisement. What is not ok is to write text ad in the form of article (or even let the sponsor write it), and then publish it as if it would be a normal article.
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:30:26
Thats the point. Personal info is required when you want to deposit fiat, since you are able to scam the exchange (send money, then cancel). No non-fiat exchange requires identification. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:29:18
I agree then we will see who is faster! :-)
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:36:13
Sorry, I don't get what you are trying to say. If a robber steals money from a bank, it has nothing to do with me, even if I am a client of it. The bank is insured and I will still get the money. With bitcoin, if someone steals it from me, I don't have it anymore. That's what I was asking.
@_date: 2014-04-30 08:02:48
Sadly, you are right. On a more general level, bitcoin itself is not very good at marketing, but nobody seems to be able to do something about it.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:27:36
I dont like your answer or accusing OP. Bitcoin people heavily promote using and investing into btc, and if something bad happen, it is always that person mistake. I highly doubt mainstream society will be willing to put up with such an attitude. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 10:49:57
Innocent question: Why do you think bitcoin would fulfill that green letters promise?
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:28:35


You mean they would double-spend exchange deposit? They can try that, by withdrawing large amount of fiat will trigger a manual check and will likely to be delayed at least for a several hours, and then the double-spend attempt will be discovered. So, this attack is possible, but rather difficult to actually execute.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:18:10


Or there is another possibility - you are a large wealthy entity (coalition of states, coalition of banks), who would benefit from the NON-existence of bitcoin (or whose profits are threatened by bitcoin). Simply, they would want to 51%-attack bitcoin to destroy trust in it, not to profit from that attack directly.
And the Oleg's point - which I agree with - is that instead of trying to restraint ghash.io, we should instead urging their competitors to also build large private mining farms, so the hashrate will be much higher than today, which will make more and more expensive for any party to obtain significant share. And that will be actual security increase.
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:39:26

It is certainly possible something like this might happen, I just don't see why would that be the case due to the funny name. For example, there is a domain registrator called godaddy.com, which also has a funny name, but the business is going just fine, because they are able to register domains just the same as any other registrator with serious name.

Still, being able to implement CoreBitcoin requires quite a detailed knowledge of the bitcoin technology.
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:57:50
This is good for bitcoin. The more the difficulty rises, the harder for any one entity to amass 51% of all mining hardware.
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:55:49
Did you actually tried it? I tried it with another coin and usually the biggest pools gave more profit, since those were the most reliable ones.

Hi, welcome in ;-)
Actually, you are partially right about cryptsy, your experience is not an isolated case, but we kind of used to live with that... yes, cryptsy is sometimes slow, and it sucks in some ways, but still they have the biggest volume of all alt-exchanges, which is very important for day traders, and they also got a good selection of coins.
Also, to be fair, ALL alt-exchanges do have issues, not just cryptsy.
My suggestion would be to just find one or two which you consider most suitable and let it be...
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:10:18

@_date: 2014-06-30 23:16:56
Several things, one big issue I noticed that most of the prominent members of the community left after a row with one particular business owner, including one of the co-creators. So basically almost no one remained from the original leaders and it kind of went downhill since then. But of course that's just my subjective perception of the situation.
@_date: 2014-07-21 05:50:44


But it is also a publicity for the bitcoin itself, which helps with adoption. I'd call it win-win solution.

But this is impractical if you are trading...


Great advice! I am also following this for a few weeks already. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 08:47:17
Sorry, but the analogy doesn't hold.
Look what is happening in China. If they will really succeed in banning all banks and 3rd party processors from dealing with exchanges, that is, in practical terms, similar to having the bitcoin banned in that country. Not in the technological sense, but in economic one - it will prevent bitcoin from being a relevant economic factor.
If something like that happens, the better analogy would be that the fence is all around the lawn, and there are just a few smaller gaps, through which only a few people are willing to crawl.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:28:36
But the question is: why others could not? Are they not that good like ghash? And if not, can't they improve? There isn't some kind of a cap - if other will keep increasing their hashrate quicker than ghash, their piece of the pie will grow, while ghash's will shrink. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:06:52
Isn't this inevitable? Even if a pool has for example 25 or 30%, it can statistically reach 42% of mined block some day.

At cex.io you can at least trade, so you might not lose at the end when you sell it back when the price is high.

Thank you and thank you. I already thought I am alone on this. They should not restrict anything, since the overall network hashrate isn't high enough yet to consider bitcoin safe. It just takes several hundreds millions of dollars to secretly amass 51% of hardware.
What should be done instead is that other pools should step up their game and increase their own hashrate.
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:34:52
Which government made you think so?

OP: If after your posts, some newbies will move their funds from btc-e to some other exchange, and that other exchange will screw them, while btc-e will continue their operation just like now, will you reinburse those newbies then?
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:49:44
But if none of the pools has 51%, then the majority of the network is owned by 2 or 3 pools. That is much better than one, of course, but still, can it be called decentralization?
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:46:56
FYI: Not sure if this isn't against reddit rules.
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:39:57
You sounds like you have some ulterior motives by attacking other coins, similarly to "fiat people" attacking bitcoin, but if you are really interested, why you don't study the coin? They are also other features implemented or planned, like X11 mining or masternodes. (Disclaimer: I don't own any DRK, but just don't like this attacking attitude).
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:10:23
I see, but as we remember, in January, when ghash reached 42%, they published a press release, claiming that they own 45% of pool's hardware, which at that time meant around 19% of the total hashrate (0.42*0.45). So if for a single company acquiring 19% is doable, then 51% is probably also possible. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:28:51
No problem, I'll wait until wikipedia introduces true bitcoin donation. This is in essence the same thing as if donating with fiat, only the coinbase does the conversion. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:10:42


It was like this in the past, but in recent weeks I don't see such a correlation here.
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:15:05
OP: I think the important factor is, that there is a free market, where people can buy virtually any amount of BTC they are interested in (if they have enough fiat, of course, but many people do). So there isn't any lockin, which would prevent the distribution to change.
I tend to think that such a distribution is actually normal. For example, in dogecoin, there are various mechanisms which entice people to redistribute the coin to as much people as possible, but still, the distribution is similar to bitcoin's.

No no, burden of proof is on the parent, why shouldn't they?
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:00:04
Or to be more precise, they mined 51% of blocks over the 24-hour period. If they had 51% of hashing power, they would statistically mine much more than 51% of blocks at some "lucky" days. It is not possible to measure the hashing power of the pool, that value is only self-reported by the pool.

I noticed this on many subreddits, there are some general opinions on a subreddit, and if you will go against it, you will get downvoted. Some innocent example: in they have high regard for human chess, but consider computer chess somewhat inferior. So if you will come with the idea that also two computers can play a cool chess game of value, you will likely be rejected.
For cryptos, it is more so since people are invested in a coin. Go to other coin's subreddits, it's the same.

Ok fair point. I am just not sure if the general public will be willing to put up with an attitude that the btc is promoted as something positive for the society, but when someone screws up, the reaction is just: "meh, you are just loser/gambler/ignorant, your problem dude." Not sure if such an technology has a chance in a big scale. I thought that yes but I am not sure anymore.

@_date: 2014-06-04 15:52:45
By the same logic, why other people who also sit on a lot of coins and do nothing, why dont they donate to the devs? That would also increase the value of those people coins. It doesnt matter who has how many coins, you would just like other people to donate their free time to it, or thats my impression. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:30:30
The problem is, that there is a big economic dis-incentive to split the blockchain, that the big miners will not do that. The development probably will stay centralized. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:24:49
Maybe not, but then it is strange that other businesses didn't have much problem with the community leadership. Anyway, I was just stating that those departures contributed greatly to the current dogecoin decline. But surely there are more factors. IMHO it would be better if businesses weren't part of the community, since there are sometimes conflicts of interests (between their business and the coin).
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:53:25
Hm...but should the developer necessarily know, that the issue he is coding has an edge condition, which is described in a wiki under some non-guessable name? (malleability?!) I think devs or whoever should create a proper protocol doc, not just reference some wiki page with an obscure name.

@_date: 2014-09-18 16:46:53
Others will gain more, but only if the price of btc will not go further down - larger departure of miners can be followed by dumping their coins and decreasing the trust in btc. In that case price can ho further down, making the remaining miners not earning more than before. 
I am writing about this scenario since I watched it in some altcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:40:18
Having shorter confirmation time is practical in certain cases, so that's one reason.
But I am not defending litecoin; as I understand it, litecoin philosophy was that it supposed to be more decentralized as bitcoin, since back in 2011 people believed that scrypt cannot be mined by GPU, yet alone ASICs, while the bitcoin mining already started to centralize in big GPU farms and later ASICs.
Now the situation appears developing in a direction that bitcoin mining will be profitable only for a few big ASICs manufacturers. Interestingly, this didn't prove to be such a big problem for most people, as GPU owners and people from litecoin, vertcoin and other communities wanted us to believe. But I think it is unfair to call it BS - it became apparent only recently that their mining decentralization attempts doesn't matter much to the coin success.
@_date: 2014-05-12 08:54:52


Yes, that's true. IMHO, bitcoin's PR is exceptionally bad.
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:31:10


I am following the alt scene, and, regrettably, I must say that you are not correct with this. Just a few have grown, and those who were, certainly did not grow significantly. There are just a few left who fights for survival, and many became abandoned by the original creators, and their value at exchanges is going slowly down. Also, you can go to cryptmarketcap.com and look at the market cap graphs...for most coins it is just going slowly down. 
But I am not writing this as a pro-bitcoin argument, this is just a reminder to watch the situation objectively. I would very much like for at least some alts to succeed, but the situation is currently not that great.

How can us gov put him in prison? You mean in Japan?
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:14:50
Yes, but the good thing is, that it is continuously more expensive to increase the global hashrate. We need to reach a level, when it will be economically unfeasible to amass 51% of hardware for any one party. Until that the bitcoin is not secure, since a new (or old) entity can invest a few ten million dollars into mining hardware and "secretly" accumulate 51% and then connect the whole thing to bitcoin network and do damage.
Regarding the profitability of mining, IMHO over time only asic manufacturers will be able to do that. (that I don't say is a good thing, albeit probably inevitable).

I read somewhere that some hardware is preconfigured to connect to ghash. 
Funny  story: my friend was selling a scrypt  mining rig, the seller visited him personally, and after a small chat, it turned out the guys dont have the slightest clue how mining works. He just read somewhere that it can be a good investment; I guess he will pay some student to configure it for him. So, dont assume every miner knows what is a pool or what is ghash.io.
Also lets not forget ghash owns ~45% of the hardware mining in their pool. At least they claimed that in the pressrelease

You was downvoted here, but I think you are correct - GHash can mine empty blocks, but that would only mean that 51% of blocks are empty, while the transactions will be mined in those other 49% of blocks. (Not saying people will be fine with that, but it will not completely halt the transactions, imho).
@_date: 2014-09-17 10:56:20
Yes, but if the new hashrate will be much lower than before, it will take proportionally longer average time to mine a block until the next difficulty adjustment.

It is not "supposed" to fail, but there is a possibility that bitcoin can follow a path some altcoins took (although it will take more time). Namely, the user adoption will not keep up with the new and dumped bitcoins going to the market, that will push the price down, and if that would happen for a prolonged time period, those who did believe in the bitcoin will stop believing in it and will eventually also sell. That way, the outcome is that the "hard believers" could still hold their coins, but it will not become a relevant economic factor.
I do not predict this will happen, but I already consider this as one possible scenario.
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:50:37
But they can buy them from a legitimate pool, can't they?
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:32:38

I don't think the inflation was a cause - the inflation is actually quite small (5% first year and lesser the next years), it even doesn't replace the lost coins. What is a bigger problem is that almost all the original leaders of the community stepped back or left.

@_date: 2014-06-17 08:02:25
I think that there are indeed a few key players who are deciding the future of bitcoin - the core devs, and the owners of the largest pools. So bitcoin de facto is centralized, since only a few people are deciding where it will go. Ghash only proposed that those key players will meet and talk, that's not making bitcoin more centralized.
@_date: 2014-08-08 10:14:58
OP: I personally see two big advantage of bitcoin, which he doesn't mention:
1) for now, I mostly use bitcoin as a store of value, which is issued predictably and independently of any government or other entity with selfish interests. 
2) I agree with him that currently paying for goods with btc is not that advantageous. But I see a big advantage to pay with BTC for prepaid services, which are also maintaining the btc account for me. For example, let's say it is a webhosting, and I send them some BTC, which will be used up slowly as I use their service. The great thing is, that when I no longer need their service, I can just move the remaining funds to another btc address, thus cancelling the service, and I get the unused money back. While with Paypal or credit card this is usually not possible or complicated.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:19:41
But what if that is their strategy? Maybe they want the price of btc on their exchange to stay low for a time being.

No, that is not possible, since there are additional checks in the protocol forbidding this. Six confirmations should be safe, since replacing larger private block will very probably not succeed. This article explain it in more detail: 
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:16:33
Thank you for answering my comment.
1) If you say we shouldn't worry about this, they why to worry about ghash.io? My point is, that any rich entity can put money and effort into bitcoin mining and can repeat what ghash.io done. If 20% is doable for a small company, 50% is also doable for someone else (ok, difficulty increased since January, but anyway...)
2) Let's not forget, there are many powerful entities (banks, maybe govs), which would profit from the non-existence of bitcoin. Those might try to attack it not for double-spend, but to destroy trust in crypto and halt transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:09:20
I agree... discouraging the most naive beginner questions is a mistake and slows down the community grow. Those questions should be encouraged, and maybe there will be volunteers who would like to answer them in bitcoin/new.
I don't know if I am correct, but in Bitcoin I often see what I call a "linux mentality": that to enter the game, you should first RTFM (Read the f.... manual), and only after you have shown some effort, you "deserve" to be helped. Unfortunatelly, most people, especially no-geeks, doesn't operate in this way. They wants to start by asking some real human some most basic question, and then proceed from there. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:04:57
But wouldn't it be even better if other pools were more proactive and amassed more miners or their own hardware, so their share will be higher?
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:57:53
I agree that python is a good starting language, but I wouldn't write off C++.
If the OP uses Windows, he can use excellent Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition, which is a free development environment, and he can use build-in GUI tools to easily create standalone application, if he wants to.
Part of C++ is also a Standard Template Library, which contains easy to use string implementation, and various other templates greatly decreases the need of using pointers.
Regarding C I would recommend that as well, it is a decent language with great support, but the disadvantage is, that it is basically Windows-only. If OP wants to contribute to bitcoin-related projects, those are mostly written in C++, as is the bitcoin source code itself.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:24:10

@_date: 2014-07-20 09:39:19

That would severely slow down the bitcoin adoption. I am happy that not everyone thinks this way.
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:07:18


Yes, but only if the price will recover. For example, this didn't happen in quite a few altcoins, and this strategy would lead to almost complete loss of capital. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:43:40
Maybe some got bored, but one big reason is that almost all main leaders left or step back, due to some conflicts (which can be searched in their sub). Then it somehow lost direction and started to fall. But it is still far from death imho, and the OP just panic sold.

They can re-sell the hardware.

Yes, but this is exactly the problem - miners are not mining for long-term profits, since their hardware will get obsolete before that. OP claims, that he even wants to mine as much as possible until the next difficulty adjustment, which is once every two weeks... so the race is to mine as much as possible now, that matters most to them.

But isn't it fundamentally vulnerable, that you need to protect the seed from theft? For example, in the greenaddress, you need to login with your seed, so you will probably copy+paste it from your password manager... aren't you then constantly worrying, that your seed can be stolen?

@_date: 2014-06-08 21:51:28
He didn't say he is happy.
But I tend to agree, bitcoin is definitely not decentralized - it is controlled by a few people, core developers with write access to the source code, and the operators of the biggest pools. But I am not sure that "16%" is a solution, theoretically pools can split themselves if they want, as seems to be the case with litecoin (coinotron+f2pool).
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:33:53
He didnt say it is a good thing. It is a feature, you pay for using the service. 
Longterm,  I think such transactions should be done off the blockchain, by some prepaid cards, etc. Paying with every drink with normal bitcoin transaction is not scalable, imho. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:39:42
OP: I believe this is a part of bitcoin culture; when you would suggest Bitcoin itself needs PR, you will get downvoted here. So they are just acting in line with how things in bitcoin are done. Maybe they know most people in bitcoin community would not appreciate it anyway. So i'd say you are right, and it is how things are done here - unpolished and PR-less. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:30:07
Imho, with the current state of the bitcoin ecosystem, you should go through the hassle of properly creating paper wallet. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 06:57:24


The trick I think they rely on is, that this will NOT happen. What about the litecoin scenario? A few weeks ago, Coinotron pool gained &gt; 50%, people went apeshit, and then some days later, the hashrate of Coinotron dropped by about 20 Ghs (which is about 20% of its hashrate, sizable amount) overnight, and suddenly, out of nowhere, a new pool called F2Pool appeared, with the similar hashrate Coinotron dropped. Currently, those two pools control together about 58% (
Of course, there isn't a proof those two are one entity, and I also don't claim that (maybe some litecoiner has more precise info). But the suspicion is there, but anyway, it didn't spawn a fatal distrust in the currency. I think the human mentality gravitates towards getting used to the issue, and this will probably happen to bitcoin as well. Most people will get used to ghash.io's 50%, or they will secretly split. This will also raise suspicion, only to be slowly forgotten as time goes by.
As I see it, many people would like to see this solved, but given how the PoW works, it would require some breakthrough innovation to solve 51%, and it just wasn't invented yet. So for those people angry at ghash.io (I don't mean OP or parent commenter): If you are so agitated and truly want to help, study the algorithm and try to invent the solution...
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:56:47
People are using it. Also, lets not forget ghash.io owns 45% of hardware in their pool (they said that), which are they renting through cex.io. So thats also one reason why they are biggest. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:51:13


And he wrote that it also cost money to pay with bitcoin (transaction fee). And that I think is true.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:04:05
I dont think you are right, but i would ponder it more. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:48:31
But for example according to this press-release ( they themselves own 45% of the hardware in their pool. Also, some miners don't know what is ghash.io or even what is a pool. They bought the hardware, and it was preconfigured to connect to the ghash.io.
It is maybe hardly believable, but as I mentioned already in other thread, once my friend was selling a scrypt mining rig, and the guy who was buying it knew literally nothing about mining, he just heard that it is a good investment. ;) So he will find someone to configure it for him, and he really don't know that he is "backing" some pool. So yes, some miners will leave, but I am really not sure how many.

He is not dumb. Apple really didn't give (to this day) any rational reason why they blocked those apps, and for example with the Blockchain app, they awkwardly removed and then again included it several times to the store, and also excluded it from the search results for the word "Bitcoin". They really did several childish things related to bitcoin apps, whose cringeworthiness easily matches those people smashing their iDevices. Your defending Apple in this case is unsubstantiated.

Yes, but:
1) OP made a mistake not to protect it with bip38, or splitting the private key to two physical locations
2) it is not clear whether the robbers managed to open the safe. (I don't know how hard is that, but isn't their whole point to not be easily openable? Otherwise, you could use shoe box instead).
@_date: 2014-03-26 11:41:34
You are being downvoted like crazy, but I think your comment has a merit. Let me react to this:


I come from an European country where there is no official bitcoin organization, nobody is poking government about bitcoin, and they indeed are leaving crypto alone. But regrettably, this didn't foster much of anything, since many businesses are waiting for the bitcoin legal status become more clear (I talked with some of them about it). Of course, this unclear legal status didn't stop banks from haunting local exchanges with AML. As a results, not many entrepreneurs wants to enter bitcoin.

I doubt, probably not. But I am not sure if they can't order exchanges to reveal the withdraws transactions and their associated real names. Then they will know how much BTC you've got, and also can track where they moved later on.

Maybe I am going to burn a few karma points now, but I do not agree with the PSA. My experience is, that keeping BTC on an exchange is a reasonable compromise between security and convenience. 
If one wants to manipulate with the money, the only safest way is to use Armory on an offline computer. Other than that, keeping money on the REPUTABLE exchange is one of the better alternatives, IMHO. If you yourself take care of the wallet.dat file, it still can be stolen, or the backup is stolen, or its get corrupted...
The key is that you have to use reputable exchange, and if there are suspicious signs, go elsewhere immediately.
TL;DR: I don't agree. Keeping BTC on a reputable exchange is a reasonably safe place comparing to other alternatives.

I think the author meant, that if you send that 1 BTC through coinbase, you will also pay a fee to them. (I don't know if it is 1% of the sum, or how he came to the number 101). So if you send 1 btc, it is probably 1.01, not 1. You need to add fee.

I agree. But do you believe such people doesn't exist, or will not exist in the future? Because this "only" reason is actually a big one, imho. Actually, there are a lot of wealthy people who will benefit from non-existence of cryptos.
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:17:14
Yes, if a service owns a private key for your deposit, there is always a risk, and if you want to completely eliminate this risk, then of course run from btc-e, and also run from any other exchange. 
But the suggestion to run specifically out of btc-e is wrong for the following reason: lot of people will avoid btc-e due to these advices, and will choose other exchanges, where the risk of being screwed is even higher, despite their owners not being anonymous. People already lost sizable assets on mtgox, bitcash, vircurex, cryptorush... and they wouldn't lost it, had they deposited their money to btc-e instead.

I see your point. I did subscribe to the bitcoin-dev mailing list a few weeks ago, and then I noticed that some of the big pools operators are also there. From one perspective that's good, since they cooperate with the bitcoin protocol developement, but it also occured to me back then, that bitcoin just isn't decentralized - there are a few core dev and a big pool owners, together maybe 10 or 15 people, and they are deciding how bitcoin will develop. What's decentralized about it?
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:01:45
My observation is that it is all quite complex, but what I wanted to point out is, that OP claims that "ghash.io still doesn't get it", but he himself uses an untrue statement to back up his claim.

I agree, other exchanges just don't have the usable volume.
But cryptsy does have its issues, like withdraw/deposit delays, sometimes more than 24 hours, and the site is also unresponsive quite often. I also witnessed once that when some coin was pumped, for example, the order list became messed up...like showing buy price lower than sell price. ;-) (but to be fair, I saw this on other exchange as well).

Yes, but that only means that that trader is more unsuccessful than you, not that you have some good strategy.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:57:33
I did read the article, but remain unconvinced. The author thinks, that:


It is not clear, whether such dominance itself wouldn't cause the fatal loss of confidence. I think it would.
Also, if some technical problem would happen to this monopoly farm and it would be unable to mine (at least for some time), the next block would have to be mined by those remaining miners, which would take an enormous time then. (For example, if the monopoly would have 90% of hash power and then stops mining, it will take not 10, but 100 minutes on average to mine the next block).
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:52:33
I believe they have a paper backup in some safe bank deposit. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:02:13
My point was mainly this: what should ghash.io do? If they reach certain amount of mined blocks in a given day, they then intentionally should not mine another block that day, so they will not appear to nearing 51%?
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:05:01
But the parent is more precise - if those buyers only want to buy small amounts, while the sellers want to sell large amount, that will not move the price up, even if there are more buyers. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:39:20


As I understand it, they are excluding transactions to have their block smaller in size, so under a condition when two competing miners will mine their block at roughly the same time, the smaller block should propagate quicker accros the network, which can help them to win the "PoW battle" (more miners will get the smaller block first, making them abandon the competing one). So it might be rational for miners to do this. (But I didn't read those studies you mention, though).
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:19:19
But look at the last paragraph: "We will offer customers the ability to convert their fiat money to cryptocurrency on our website"... so they will still accept dollars, they will just immediately convert it to crypto.

I don't understand, why nobody needs to be trusted? How will you buy bitcoin without trusting the seller, or trade bitcoin without trusting the exchange?
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:02:49
Sorry, but basically all crypto-currencies, and also more other projects related to crypto are written in C++. C++ is a great general purpose, multi-platform language, with huge support in both Windows and Linux. Also, there are very high-level constructs in C++, so it is not (only) super-low-level language.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:47:50
Why? His description of the possible double-spend scenario by 51% hashing power is correct. People are spreading FUD related to "with 51% you can do double-spend", but usually fail to mention that it is mostly a theoretical attack, since in practice it is very risky and easily observable. Please try to understand why parent says - if you do, I don't think you could call it useless or irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:37:59
It is when a lot of people put sell order on an exchange at the price $650. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:19:33
... and in case of ghash.io, he is also wrong because:
(3) the pool can also mine on their own hardware (cex.io GH/s renting)
(4) some miners doesn't even know what is a pool or what is ghash.io, they just bought hardware preconfigured to mine at that pool.

I am not defending gox here, but this is just the nature of decentralized currency.  People smashing their iphones, people being dicks to newbies, people running illegal business with bitcoins and then get caught - all of this costs us money (if you mean that the price of btc could be much higher if people didnt make negative pr). 
So I agree with you but gox is just one instance of negative pr.

@_date: 2014-07-01 11:31:29
I agree, and I am also full bitcoin for now.


But this is possible only in certain cases. For example regarding the PoS, maybe it will be further improved in the coming years, and might prove to be better than PoW [that's not true currently, but could be later on]. But this change will likely not be adopted to Bitcoin, since no sha-256 miner would agree to switch and lose their mining equipment investment.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:51:11
But there are some additional timestamp checks, you cant completely replace more than six already mined blocks. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:04:59
First of all, ghash.io also owns their own hardware, which they rent through cex.io. So basically they are also mining, and I remember they released some press release a few months ago, where they claimed the cex.io hardware makes 45 or 55% (don't remember).
Also, this I only read somewhere, that some hardware is preconfigured to mine at ghash.io..so someone buys it, plug it in and it mines. Those people might even not known what is a pool...
Third reason could be that just the profit is good...like good uptime, low fees etc. You would be surprised about how much miners do not care about crypto at all... really. They dump to fiat and that's about it.
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:41:47
I agree with your last sentence. I also watched a few alts in the past, and it is always the same - the coin is always controlled by a few main developers and the owners of the biggest pools. So the crypto-currency as designed by Satoshi is definitely not decentralized.

There are NOT other alternatives for Cryptsy, really... I wish there were some, but currently, they are not. Yes, deposits are not always instantaneous. I can't talk for them, but I am guessing this has to do with the issue, that the deposit address you are given from them, is a cold storage address, so if the pool of those is used up, they have to perform some physical action to generate new addresses, and that might take time. This can possibly happen when suddenly a lot of people want a deposit address for some specific coin. But i am only guessing, don't know what else is happening there.

It is of course ok to create second layer on top of bitcoin blockchain, which in this case serves as something like a cache for transactions. Anyway, I am still unsure if this is better as what Vitalik proposes for ETH - blockchain sharding, which is also supposed to solve the scaling problem, but with keeping the blockchain-level security.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:54:39
This is probably true, I even upvoted your comment, but I still see a deeper problem here, i.e. that the Bitcoin community is split... one group thinks that everything should be on mainchain and we need to increase block size, another group thinks that second layer should be introduced to cache transactions, there is also a group who says that BTC should have to implement similar VM for smart contract as ETH has, etc.
What is even worse is that the decision process about which path to take is mostly non-transparent... unlike with ETH, where Vitalik just shows the direction and people then follow him.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:19:39
I agree with your worldview and upvoted your comment, but from another perspective, even bitcoiners themselves advise people to invest only the money you are willing to loose, even when in this way crypto can't replace banks, because where you then store your money you are not willing to loose?
It's like a few days ago, there was a thread where one guy wrongly sent 21 BCH to a BTC address on Kraken, and after several months, Kraken didn't still return his money, and now he needs to delay his life-changing surgery. Of course, it was solely his mistake, but there are many ways one can make such a mistake and loose the money... of course, not being able to reverse the mistake can be called a "feature" instead of weakness, the question is if general public will adopt crypto even in these conditions.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:42:03
Yes they have been saying that, but the majority went with ETH, since apparently not everyone agrees with what ETC is saying. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:53:29
And what about Vitalik's blockchain sharding proposal for ETH? It's like a second layer, but that second layer will also offer blockchain-level security. If it will work, it looks to me that is at least as good as Lightning solution. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:50:22
OP, taking your points, only the  worries me. Yes, it is very non-intuitive that even a clearly fraudulent transaction cannot be reversed. I do know that "this is a feature, not a bug", but I wonder how many common people will accept this paradigm. It goes against how the world normally operates, where the crime is punished and stolen property is returned to the owner, whenever possible.

I don't own any BCH and don't plan to, but why would it be a turd? Having just one big blockchain with big blocks and without second layer is pretty normal crypto approach... I myself am even curious how it will scale later on. Trying to rename BTC to Bitcoin Core is another thing, it's malicious and unfair practice. But it looks like it is not legally possible to forbid him to do that.

It was not proven that it is not sustainable. What is clear is that running a full node will cost more over time.

Yes. And of course electricity doesnt have some fixed price within a country. I know some people who are in GPU mining, and they secure special deals with some small electricity producers to buy their spare unused electricity. Without that, the mining just wouldnt be profitable.

Isn't it distracting?

But how do you solve the problem, that someone steals the money and the crime is not punished, as if nothing bad happened. Common people will not agree to this anyway.

But what if the biggest miners will not agree on the change, because it will go against their interests?

Yes, actually OP doesn't imply it is a bug, but I think he is right that this will hinder adoption or make the blockchain technologies to not take off. This feature goes against how people in this world normally operate.

I dont, but it already happened that miners were blocking some change, which would be good for bitcoin, but not for them.


This is questionable. One core reason why investors trust bitcoin (much more than other coins) is that the protocol is immutable, that the rules doesnt change. If I put a lot of my money into crypto coin, I actually like than a lot of people has stake in it as well, that miners invested millions in the equipment. The last thing I would want is someone looking for some pandora boxes to open.
If ETH will go that route, thats great, at least crypto community will explore this path... if it turns out good then OK, I am hodling some ETH as well. But I just think BTC should stay as a "trusted daddy" without such innovations.

Because why specifically now? This is a very bad time to sell.
OP, can I have a counter-question? Why did you buy, if you don't believe it will go back up higher than the price you bought?

Bitcoin actually do not "require" that much electricity. It's just it is very profitable to mine, so miners are competing against each other and increase hashrate.

I agree with this, but on top of that:
1) He constantly FUDs that other group, BTC, thus effectively undermining the trust in crypto in general.
2) He tries to rename the "Bitcoin" coin (BTC) as "Bitcoin Core", while that coin is called just Bitcoin (that one word) for more than 8 years already. He does that intentionally to spread confusion.

But this is only true for you and people like you, who value immutability over everything else. I and some other people agree with Vitalik tweet.
But does Vitalik really has such power? I think he only suggested the fork, and it was still up to the community to decide. Those people who didn't agree ran with Ethereum Classic. I hold some ETH and it does have value for me.

I think I understand this point, what I wanted to say is, that I consider the stance "immutability is above all else" as purely personal opinion. You probably value it as some absolute goodness, some other people might not, even if you compare mutability with centralized banks.

Or Nick Szabo could be it. There are several indices why yes, and no definitive proof that he isn't. I agree with you that this is just a hoax.
@_date: 2016-05-04 07:12:34
IMHO, only two people are likely candidates to be Satoshi - Nick Szabo and Hal Finney.
