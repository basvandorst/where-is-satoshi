You'd have to have access to OTC market data - Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini... They all deal with institutional clients, but the amounts are never revealed to the public. As a retail market participant you can only observe and draw conclusions. I like to listen to Richard Heart comments from time to time - last time he pointed out that the massive pump we recently experienced wasn't coordinated with futures price movement (it stayed pretty much spot all the way up). That tells you something - who could be inclined to pass on such opportunity?

Make everyone around you think you've earned it with your work like everyone else, otherwise some people become very resentful and treat you differently. Never brag.

To be honest, there is nothing to do for the average Joe at the moment. It's time for mainstream institutions to introduce grandma-friendly solutions for bitcoin transactions. Tech savvy audience are already in on crypto and don't need a third party to hold their hand. The untapped market is people that are enthusiastic about bitcoin but are not comfortable with their tech abilities or afraid of the unregulated market to get involved. They need recognised institutions like Goldman Sachs to tell them it's ok to invest. I don't think it's a bad thing GS is getting involved. They have no power to control bitcoin anyway.

OP, get a Trezor -it displays the real destination address on the device screen before you send it. It's impossible to swap or mask the address on a hardware wallet (yes, if you were double checking it on your computer screen, a more sophisticated malware could actually change what you see even after you "paste"). Same with generating receiving addresses-Trezor will allow you to display the address and verify before you share it with anyone. Having said that, if I were you I would get super careful now and even consider using an air-gaped computer for my transactions going forward. Someone knows you have bitcoin and is targeting you.

You're right that it may not be easy to exchange for bitcoin, but same as libra, it might be a good way to familiarize more people with the mechanics of crypto (wallets, keys, security etc). It'll be a smaller leap than from fiat to bitcoin, and good incentive to make this leap considering the chinacoin will be likely inflationary and just another surveillance tool. They can ban bitcoin exchanges regardless, but some P2P will always exist.

?? You don't need Trezor if you already have two ledgers. I guess ledger could be better for some niche altcoin investors. If you're only using bitcoin and major alts, all you really need is Trezor One, but if you live in Australia you have to compare the shipping costs (Trezor is shipped from EU). It's good to have two devices though, for the peace of mind.

You'd think it'd be priced in, but it doesn't seem to be the case historically. I guess most bitcoin trading volume comes from investors who disregard supply stream of newly mined coins as a price factor, which is strange, because it's a very predictable constant.

The best way I found for myself to manage my FOMO buying/selling/swapping desires is the dollar cost averaging. I simply plan ahead how much I want to set aside every week for the next year, and stick to it. Let's say: I buy $100 worth of bitcoin every Monday, no matter what. The price will swing back an forth regardless, so I stopped beating myself for not being a psychic. It works like a charm, I'm much less stressed and my hodlings are doing great.

I thought a full nodes is a node that sends and receives. Otherwise it's not really full, it's not securing the network and it only benefits the wallet holder (i.e. holder can verify that transactions meet consensus rules).
99% of home networks have 8333 blocked by default (not on purpose, they're just not configured to forward traffic to relevant machine which is hosting the bitcoin client - obviously most people don't know how to do this, and there is no "universal" step by step guide due to the variety of routers people use).

Not for me, but for the bitcoin network it does - you are sharing results of validation done by your computer, you allow other users to download blocks faster, you also increase the speed of block propagation. (Not that it matters much, 9k is more than enough for BTC. Some altcoins successfully operate on less than 100.)
I've checked the wiki and you're right - what I'm thinking of is called "Archival Node" there. Full node is just fully validating.

I'm not too worried. So called "paper bitcoin" means getting your foot into regulatory door which bitcoin so desperately needs at this stage. Once we're there, physical bitcoin will gain in popularity because with the utility of the actual thing there is no other way around it.

I used it once to pay with LN, flawless payment, but it didn't work for my provider, and they returned my coins immediately via mainnet, free of fee. This can be easily abused in high fee environment for LN coin settlement, unless they do have some ways to protect against it that I am not aware.

Once you go online, it's up to the consensus rules of the software you're using to verify its validity. It's as secure as downloading it from the scratch. Of course, you should never use an offline chain - to I don't know, verify balances? - it wouldn't make any sense.

This is why Bitmain went bankrupt in less than 6 months. Companies like Tesla don't even receive bitcoin. They are using external companies to immediately hedge the payment into USD. You can't be a listed car company and still have bitcoin on your books. Speculation is not their business, and holding bitcoin is more risky than holding units of a hedge fund. They would get sued by their investors and probably lose.

For anyone in Europe, keep some cash on a Revolut card to avoid getting fucked ("financially excluded") like OP did (your bank might be the next one).

1. Don't invest more in Bitcoin than you can afford to lose. 3% net worth is sensible, don't exceed 10%.   
2. Stay away from bitcoin alternatives. Alternative cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with bitcoin price and much more volatile. Buying multiple cryptocurrencies is leveraging your risk - you DO NOT diversify your risk that way.  
3. Never keep your bitcoin or any money on an exchange for longer than absolutely necessary. In fact, buy a hardware wallet (I recommend Trezor one) and set it up ahead of time to have a secure address where you can withdraw your coins from the exchange.   
4. If you want to use a wallet app, remember that it is not safe. Always assume that you can lose bitcoin that you keep in a hot wallet app - only keep a small amount in it and keep most of your funds on a Trezor.
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:49:57

Liquidity means there are a lot of buy and sell orders (lots of people trading) and you always get the best market price. By KYC/AML (know your client/anti money laundering) I mean standard procedures that all regulated exchanges have in place to verify your identity. It usually requires a scan of your ID or a utility bill on your name, depending on where you live. It's a regulatory requirement to minimise the risk of facilitating some illegal activity like terrorism.

884 was how I've learned about the Joe Rogan podcast. I was a fan ever since.

His demographics is like 99% consistent with bitcoin demographics (educated 20-40 males with libertarian leaning), and so is his YouTube friends' like Joe Rogan, Bret Weinstein, Sam Harris and many, many more.
In short, you want this guy on board, spreading the word of censorship resistant money. So donate to make him see there are actual people behind the magic internet money.

Peterson's audience demographics = bitcoin demographics. Donate to make him spread the word for ultimate synergy.

Ugh... The guy did more for the mtgox rehabilitation process than anyone. At this point I doubt any sensible creditor would want to see him locked up.

Bitstamp is probably number one in Europe. Long history, very good liquidity and security. Kraken is also very good and secure, they are very transparent (audits etc.), very good reputation. Keep in mind that you'll need to go through some level of KYC/AML procedures. Do as much as you can before you start trading, so you can withdraw your funds faster and don't get stuck with some withdrawal limits. Also, use two factor authentication, most exchanges support it.

Kraken and Bitstamp are the only good options in EU. I opt for Kraken because of their superior transparency. I had a bad experience with Bitstamp during KYC - they won't accept watermarked ID scan, so you expose yourself to identity theft.

As much as you keep a blind eye on the alternative cost of mining instead of just keeping the money in bitcoin, it works out just fine.

Hey guys! I have a GREAT idea. Let's invest in a second degree fork which lost value with every transition so far, that can easily be forked for the third time because of the kind of responsible "community leaders" it attracts.

Duh, I withdrawn from lntip to eclair with no problem. Once routed through satoshi place channel, the other time to my direct channel which I opened with the lntip bot (see their instructions page). Bitcoin fees, it's not like you're spending a fortune, and you get a chance to test the technology at its infancy. Pretty neat experience you can bore your future children with.

Do you mean 25 word seed? I think 24 used to be the standard for Trezor, but they moved to 12 by default at some point. The passphrase (on top of the seed) is a second layer for hardware wallets - I doubt they can uncover it even with the physical access to the device. They can probably brute force it given enough time, so the longer the passphrase the better.

Ah, I was wondering why they were ranked so high on 1ML. Thanks, I will definitely try setting more channels out there!
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:47:21
So what is your best chance to actually make some money on running full LN node? Do you need more or bigger channels opened?

Missed the ??? step, which is the most difficult for most investors.
