most likely a scam, either it wants your information or you have to send x amount and you'll receive like 100x what you send, should be common sense, nothing is really free.

I just started trading recently but I've known about bitcoin since it was $200, I also lost $1100 in bitcoin to some stupid trading decisions. Maybe I should just stick to hodling. At the moment just buying low and selling at high points
