Ahhh, their payout keys - they point to different users. That makes sense.  Then yeah, their nonces are independent.  
So, by many miners vs one Bitcoin daemon - do you mean a mining pool, or an entire singular blockchain?  Either way, yeah - it just assigns each miner a different chunk of nonces, and each individual just scans by incrementing. Makes sense.  
Ah okay. So final summary: 2 miners not in a pool are scanning for nonces and it doesn't matter if their nonces match due to different payout keys.  Thus in effect they're just scanning different 2^32 chunks of nonces from a hugely larger set. If somehow their block headers were the same though - e.g. by having the same payout keys - then they would be mining the same nonces and we'd have a problem, but that shouldn't happen.  Anyone "mining for charity", passing on block winnings to some common source might trigger something weird like this though.

Yeah, I figured with such huge numbers it doesn't really matter either way - but are the chances strictly independent for different miners, and there's really no chance of overlap?  I'm not sure why, supposing they've all received the same transactions, point to the same previous block, use the same timestamp, etc. Shouldn't the nonce be the only different thing and thus they might be overlapping if they pick the same one?  
I guess it's a related (and worse) problem too that these nonces being tried may not be picked with perfect randomness.  They may be overlapping on some random seeds or even iterating the same sections.  This, I assume, is handled by the mining pool / mining software though.  I'm just curious since these aren't addressed in the theory papers I've read.

True enough.

A good point - thanks
