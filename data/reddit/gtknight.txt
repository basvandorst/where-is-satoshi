It's already heading back up as soon as you posted this. Probably the last drop we are going to see for now.

So from what I've read it's understandable to avoid keeping coins in third party systems due to it could disappear at any time. I've created an account at coinbase but haven't bought any coins just yet, do you think I should avoid it??

It's already heading back to leveling itself out lol.

I can't wait for the crash imo, gives me an opportunity to buy more then watch the value raise up even higher.

You do make a good point. I was thinking of just trying to earn a little BTC and go from there. I still think at it's current rate would be a good investment but of course there is always that risk.

It's going to go back up, I'm still sticking in for the long run. Probably take advantage of this and buy some more.

I probably need the money to gain access first! I'm so confused!!!

Yea didn't think about that... will definitely take it into consideration, thanks.
