By framework do you mean this?

Would've been better if it was in Orlando but unfortunately the teams in the bowl couldn't be predicted. At least Orlando is only an hour away so it's not too bad of a drive for most fans.

"...some banks, including Bank of America, Citizens Bank and Santander, won’t make corrections until Monday, the next business day." 
I hope that none of those 1300 people affected were relying on the money this weekend.
@_date: 2014-12-26 12:35:41
...probably because college bowl games mean nothing to anyone outside of the two teams playing. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:45:10
Yeah, it's crazy to think that it's even possible that this could actually happen. I don't know how there isn't a security measure in place to make sure it can't happen... as simple as an extra dialogue box that says "You are attempting to WITHDRAW money OUT of these accounts instead of deposit. Are you sure? Yes or No? (I'm not sure how their system even works, I'm assuming someone is doing it manually on a computer). Why would they have the ability to take money out anyway? It's very weird.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:40:46
If something happened over the weekend where an employee needed the money but did not have access to it because of the mistake I could see a case... this is America we're talking about here. You can sue for anything. I'm not saying the person would win but you never know.

Lots of football games are played in baseball parks... even the NFL uses them sometimes. For example, the Miami Dolphins NFL team and Florida Marlins MLB team shared Sun Life Stadium for years before the Marlins got their own place in 2012.
@_date: 2014-12-26 13:06:52
Yea, the only people I've known to semi-care about these types of games outside of being associated with the teams are indeed gamblers. I don't mind, I think gambling is fine. I just think that most of the bowl games except for the Rose Bowl don't really matter. I mean, when's the last time anyone has heard someone talk about North Carolina State or University of Central Florida?

Last I checked Gox was never used by employers to pay employees via direct deposit...

Alcohol is the craziest drug I've ever done and I bought it at the store... and I've tried many, many drugs.  It's asinine.  If alcohol is legal, all drugs should be legal.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:39:13
2 is not a valid excuse. Relying on Google Translate and not having someone who reads/writes english for a legal document worth hundreds of thousands of dollars is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  If they truly did this, then it sounds like they weren't concerned about the total value of the contract which means they should just pay the amount they're asking which is much cheaper for okcoin.  If they could truly afford it without worrying, they would have paid it off without making a big stink.
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:51:16
What's the story with the lawyer in the email thread that disappeared when asked about credentials?  Actually forget it, I don't care either.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:10:08
As they say, silence speaks louder than words.  That lawyer definitely never existed. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:10:51
hopefully you're not trusting them with any funds at this point. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:06:55
What a bunch of losers at OKCoin.  If anyone ever acted like this toward me when I had a contract with them, regardless of how crazy they think the terms are, I'd do the same thing as Ver.  They signed it.  Fuck everyone at OKCoin.  I hope they never recover.

Interesting, thank you.  Do you happen to know if the latest bitcoin core software is needed?  I ask because I opened Armory in Ubuntu for the first time in a long time and it says an update to bitcoin core is available but I'd have to manually install (armory update was automatic).  I'm not a linux expert so I'm not sure how to update after downloading it.  Thanks again.

The douchebag troll that wrote it, Brad Bailey, is a nobody whose claim to fame is his blog called techgenmag (I never heard of it either).  His  goal in life is to attend an Apple keynote... what more needs to be said? 
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:10:44
There would be no demand for "krokodil" if all drugs were legal because safer and better quality, unadulterated drugs would be available for cheap. Again, if alcohol is legal, one of the most dangerous drugs known to man, then all drugs should be legal.
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:49:14
A lot of people have heard of it but don't know anything beyond that.  People are lazy.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:14:04
If I was Roger I'd be asking for the same or more now. They owe him but they decided to drag their feet and do this like a bunch of stubborn children.  Okcoin asked for this my opinion.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:17:37
Their culture may permit lying but it doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

Since I know that you read everything, I recommend getting off of the computer once in a while in search of physical interaction with a person of the opposite sex at least once before your life comes to an abrupt end. It might help you. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:09:52
Your assumptions make you look/sound like a sore loser, someone who just got beat up that is still saying "come on, i'm right here, come fight me!",  or you're a professional troll. Sad.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:44:12
haha, doesn't make it harder at all, just makes it more entertaining to see what professional trolls like yourself will come up with on daily basis to help drive more bitcoiners away from core and this sub to other areas. This is coming from someone that got involved with bitcoin before you based on your "It's been 5 years and counting" statement. As I've already said, you're doing a good job in harming bitcoin. Way to go!
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:24:05
Is this what the majority of your type want? People that question others about their stupid assumptions to leave bitcoin altogether? You're a perfect example of why people are stopping their support of "Core" and this sub. If your goal is to harm bitcoin, you're doing a good job.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:17:34
this is the exact type of response i expected from an immature troll like yourself. thanks for clarifying. sad!

"I'll just ignore when people question my dumb, public assumptions, then I'll be happy when everyone's gone and I'm here by myself." Sounds like a winning plan! Not.

I thought the same thing when I heard him say that. ["While most exit relays are honest and run by well-meaning volunteers, there are exceptions: In the past, some exit relays were documented to have sniffed and tampered with relayed traffic. The exposed attacks included mostly HTTPS man-in-the-middle (MitM) and SSL stripping."](

I've had the opposite experience when I used them last year. The price was a little higher on cheapair than destinia. Maybe things have changed? I have used both cheapair and destinia with success though. With Destinia I had a slight problem with my btc payment so I called them and fixed it very fast. I'd recommend both websites based on my experiences.

An encrypted wallet might not be enough in this situation if they can somehow find the password. The best solution is multi-sig wallets where some of the private keys are stored elsewhere, hopefully far away from the same place. If everyone had multi-sig wallets, it'd be almost impossible for the greedy assholes to steal any more coins.

Fiat money is a very successful fad even with all of its downfalls. If the better version of money, bitcoin, has only some of the success that fiat has had then we're all in for a wild ride. If we trade globally, which we do and will continue to do, a global form of money is inevitable.

Mobility is restricted, especially in the southwest where there are many border patrol checkpoints along roads that are very far away from the Mexican border. The government also has access to communications to attempt to figure out where you're going.
We already have secret police that are instructed to blend in with the rest of us as well as secret courts where we have no idea what goes on. Ring ring, the NDAA allows for people to disappear overnight never to be seen again, without charges no less.
Modern American society is most definitely a police state, just not as harsh as some of the others you're thinking of.

there have always been communities online where people have traded goods, regardless of their legal status... [one of the first known deals done online was between Standford and MIT for a bag of weed.]( "Technology and drugs have always existed in an easy symbiosis: the first thing ever bought and sold across the Internet was a bag of marijuana. In 1971 or 1972, students at Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory used ARPANET—the earliest iteration of the Internet—to arrange a marijuana deal with their counterparts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

Thanks for the information. I know very little about the area but I find it fascinating. I wonder what it would take for something like bitcoin to take off there... to me it seems like it'd be very useful if it was popular there... I guess like anywhere else.

Using bitcoin for services like prostitution is a perfect match. Accepting it is as simple as downloading a software wallet onto your mobile device and having the client send the funds to your new wallet when he wants to pay. Converting bitcoins back into fiat can be a bit more challenging but it's still quite easy if you have to do it.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:27:12
Some sources claim this. It's hard to find a lot of current, accurate information about this place in English though. All I know is that [some of the recent news coming out of Transnistria says that their dependence on the Russia due to rouble value collapse / Ukraine tensions is hurting them](

If that's the case then it's exactly like physical fiat currency notes.  When I'm in USA I hear, "Is your money green? Yes? Then I'll take it." Bitcoin should be no different (obviously not colored physical notes but all digital tokens should be treated equal regardless of their history).

I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually make people start logging into every account that exists on the drive. Until then, this seems okay if you have Android Lollipop.

You should add a line at the bottom that says, "Send $900+:
