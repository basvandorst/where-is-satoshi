I tried making this transaction 4 days ago.
I used electrum to generate the transaction, 
transaction has not been verified by someone it's continuing to broadcast the transaction, so founds are not free up.
any idea how to solve this issue?

Just a latest question, could make sense to perform such transaction in order to remove all these transaction increasing the fee?

And why you are asking receipt? Are in some way useful for you or just to let’s use do some activity?

Yes I verify the raw transaction and it was fine.
Other services says that fees where too low 33 satoshi to transfer 9000 satoshi.
I would like just to test this for learning, I read that coinb.in was able to send transaction also with 0 fees.

this is undoubtedly a commendable thing.
but I still do not understand how you can afford to give money for free.
looking at the address transaction in blockchain they are not also so few money...

how can I saw you with an empty address?

There isn't any transaction fee on deposit.
I just want to be sure they do not close as crispy
