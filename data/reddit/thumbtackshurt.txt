How would this affect someone who applied, but was denied? Was the info they gained access to only verified members, or all documents that were submitted?

I've been buying with Bitcoin for a while now. Mostly through Snapcard on Amazon and eBay. I have been very happy with Snapcard, BTW. Made several larger purchases (&gt;50 USD) including a Kindle without a hitch.
I usually turn around and buy more off Coinbase when I'm done to replenish. 
I'm thinking about using the [Coinbase Trader]( app to put in trailing orders, which means when successful, I would effectively be saving money when it's all said and done.

BOA seems to have a history of abusing its customers.

I'm really glad I bought in at 53081.

While I can see things like being able to discover all assets during something like a lawsuit or taxes at the end of the year, explain to me how a bank *should* get red flags when bitcoin is being used to purchase illegal items, and explain to me how that matches the current fiat. How hard would it then be to flag questionable items, and then simply frowned upon items, and then... 
If I use cold hard cash USD to pay for hookers and blow, I would be more anonymous than if I used bitcoin if I understand the article correctly. At this point, it sounds like something more restrictive than the current system, just to coddle the government, which is antithetical to a large portion of legitimate adopters in a rapidly changing global economy. A lot of people don't feel like waiting around for a creaking monolithic entity to finally catch up 10 years later, or be dumbed down to their level, or have any decision power concentrated to a few gatekeepers. Especially in the wake and ongoing battle for simple net neutrality, the relevatioin that a secret organization like the NSA furiously tracking pretty much anything, or fiat wealth hyper-concentrating to a select few.

Damn. Thank you for your hard work on this. I would tip you a good $10, but I'm fresh out right now.

My understanding is that it counted toward the purchase at the time it was submitted not when it's received, so you should be good. Go to the purchase screen and look at your daily limit.

Kind of spotty at best, and with about the same amount of accountability as a slush fund.

As someone who has submitted a similar post, let me ask you: 
1) Where can you expect to go exchange problems with other fellow Coinbase users, which incidentally would reduce the load on Coinbase's staff?
2) Considering how popular Coinbase is to begin with, isn't that something of note to people interested in bitcoin? Especially the new people...
3) Considering many of the posts in bitcoin, and understanding the ins and outs of it, isn't this also relevant? Especially when it is leaving your holdings exposed because of a choice you made without full knowledge? Is that also not of interest to bitcoiners?
My issue is that I was trying to export to wallet (not exporting a report, mind you) and mid-print my browser and therefore my computer crashed. I could only reboot, without ever having confirmed the export. If I had only managed to find somebody knowledegable (again, doesn't have to be Coinbase staff- they have a huge load on them right now as they haven't even been able to support a problem I submitted a ticket for on Monday which I haven't brought up on BTW). I was in the potential of losing what is for me a big chunk, that may still have been sitting in the printer spool and thus saveable, but people were more interested in whatever. I thought we were a pretty tight-knit group. Now I'm not so sure.

Confirmed for .001 here as well. Sweet.

What's the minimum there?

Hopefully not a relevant username this time around...

When was this? I'd like to think it's going to be here any day now.

I just tried to do a reoccuring payment for less than .1 BTC and it was rejected. Is that because I am at verification level 1?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:12:37
I just set up my first autopurchase Friday at the absolute minimum. I'm hoping it only validates against the first purchase, then auto-renews regardless of amount. I'll find out if it works in a month.
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:49:29
Get used to it.
Edit to add: I meant hitting new all-time highs.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:26:55
I think this is *the* watershed moment. With the feds expected to give the bitcoin some legitimacy vs. doubts like how quickly it's going up, then stretching the asks too thin, people are bouncing back and forth between a tulip bubble and a new disruptive technology.
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:16:06
That is perfect. I don't have to worry about fluctuation, and instead it's a budget-able, fixed amount. Great advice.

Because of bitcoin's distributed nature, too much regulation would be a missed opportunity for the US, and a gained opportunity for the countries which embrace it. China already is a big player, and I am sure they are looking to value their currency on something other than the USD. 
Also, all wallet ledgers are publicly visible, making laundering extremely difficult.

I like the idea. I'm going to try it in gallium because I like to live dangerously.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:44:22
That's awesome to hear. I know it's not much, and a little late for turkey day but here goes. Also, first time using bitcointip.

Either you're a troll, or you don't understand what the blocks are in relation to the value of bitcoin, but claim to be an expert.
Hint: It's unrelated.

From Coinbase: 
When we’ve reached our daily limits, for purchases there is an option to execute it at a “future market price”—with this option, you will receive your bitcoin at the price that exists at payout, approximately four business days from clicking Buy. If you’re unsure which purchase you made, you can look up the transaction on the Buy/Sell page under the History tab—you will see either a concrete number of bitcoin, meaning that is the fixed amount you will receive, or the message "You purchased bitcoin at the market rate," meaning the amount you receive will vary based on the market rate that exists at the moment of payout.

The problem is (in the US at least) you would need an intermediary to convert BTC to fiat, then transmit it (which would require a license). That's what's going on with Mt. Gox right now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:10:13
Well, there we go. Thank you kind stranger. I did not realize that. I just set up a reoccurring purchase. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:49:12
I am far from qualified in giving advice. I'm still new to this, and am just learning. It ended up bouncing off the 450 mark the next day as part of a second dip. 
Aslo, as a friendly reminder- it's never good to base your investments off of a place like reddit. It does give a relatively good idea though.
With that said, I do like how it's been performing when on a log chart (which assumes exponentiation [growth]), as a friend only, I strongly recommend it, but not more than you can stand to lose. There has been a dip in the last hour, so it may very well be the perfect time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:29
A LOT of people seem to have set their sell point at $900. Purely psychological. Considering the way the market is, it will recover in a little while as others try to buy in while they can. Relax and enjoy.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:14:34
Well, it seems to be fortifying around the 650-750 mark, which is good. Slower rising for the next bit would be my guess. Probably going to be another panic at 1000, 1100, etc...
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:07:32
localbitcoins is the only place I've seen somebody accept it. I can't remember who it was, but you had to have a verified Paypal account, SMS authentication, and probably some other things as well. 
Nobody really wants to touch Paypal because of the seller's risk of chargeback.

Try saying the first 6 words of the title 5 times really fast.
Nice story, BTW.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:32:46
It extends beyond the 900 bit, though. Not saying the rest isn't, but rather it's more than just that alone.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:32
It's based on more than a single selling point. It's more about the desire to control one's finances, rebelling at a time when fiat is hyperconcentrating to an elite 1%, and a willingness to barter than it is in something called "900".
