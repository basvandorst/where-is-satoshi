Can anyone verify this with a second source?

Ah yes there is potential for an insured wallet service (like [this one](
But the main model normal banks have, which I hope never happens to Bitcoin, is that they *take control* of your money, give you some sort of *receipt* for it, and then go and use it to make their own money, and pay you interest. Thus far that doesn't exist for bitcoin, and I hope it never does.

It's not at all true that 0.01XBT is worth the same to a newbie as the $5 they can sell it for. They have a significant learning curve, and to actually profit from the XBT they have to either spent it in very specific places (so it's like a gift voucher for humblebundle.com) or they have to succeed in selling it and then cashing out from an exchange. That can be a massive ball-ache.
The difference between that and the $5 cash that they can just go and spend at the nearest shop is huge. And for most people, all of that ^ effort is just not worth $5.
I love bitcoin. I hope it becomes a staple currency, that more people come to understand how it works, that more shops support bitcoin payments etc. But you can't pretend that using it right now always makes sense for everybody. It's not necessarily about them being uneducated.

I didn't recognise the genius of this satire at first... until I read the comments on reddit. Perfect article.

Bitcoin doesn't need a bank. That's one of the awesome things about it. A bitcoin wallet *is* a bank. All you need is somewhere to keep the wallet - e.g. blockchain.info. So blockchain (or something like it) is the only "bank" you need.
With regard to only allowing transactions between trusted individuals, the existing exchanges already do this. To create an account you need to give them personal information and ID etc.
This "bank for crypto-currency" really misses the point of crypto-currency, which is to make traditional banking redundant.

Doesn't inequality tend to rise in an unregulated free market?

So what you really should have done is buy bitcoin in Jan 2013, but then sell it in November to buy Twitter stock.
