I would guess that all the nodes that can't be precisely located are placed in the middle of the country.

If SEPA is coming very soon (like, in the next couple of days) they could well benefit from Mt. Gox' agony and everyone searching to jump ship. Otherwise (european) people will stick with Mt. Gox.

I'm in Europe and I don't know any other exchange where I can **easily add funds**, **free of charge** (other than a [SEPA]( transfer which are actually free for me under 50.000 €). I don't mind the (reasonable) fees on the actual BTC transactions.

[Not really.]( But I thought so too!

Where can one access these figures? bitcoincharts.com is currently down (502 error).

They use a french bank where you can deposit money via a SEPA transfer. For me it took 3-4 open days and cost me zero.

Or to not use a qwerty keyboard.

[Sierra Chart]( I don't know how to set it up like he did but [this tutorial]( cover the basics.
Does anyone know what are the settings he used (particularly the real-time update of the graph instead of the "intraday bar periods")?

Be smart and do as the president of Madagascar would do in this situation: **SHUT. DOWN. EVERYTHING.**
My address (yes I should've used a throwaway...) was among the leaked and someone tried to access my Gmail account unsuccessfuly (fortunately I had created a *somewhat* different password). I assume they already cracked most of the hashed (?) passwords. Mine was around  (with a total of 61020 accounts leaked) but they could be trying randomly.
PS: security newbie here, could someone explain the meaning of (and difference between) "hashed" and "salted"?

I'll try it, hoping the market will grow... Thanks!

Thanks for the info!

For Mt. Gox to be finished, something must replace it very soon. I'm in Europe and I don't know any other exchange where I can **easily add funds**, **free of charge** (other than a [SEPA]( transfer which are actually free for me under 50.000 €).
What do you suggest?

*REALLY?* They did this? Are you sure? If so then that's the awesomest thing Gmail has ever done to me, personally (sort of). :D Thank you Google employee, you saved a lot of people's asses!
PS: I did indeed receive the "suspicious activity" notification.
