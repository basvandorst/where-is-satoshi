satoshi is a group of financial programmers.
i did some research on the code and found references to a handful of programmers/fin experts all referencing digital currencies. this is a few years back mind you.

maybe because i did the research a few years back.. now google is full of it probably

programmers always use certain variables or function names. you have to start of course with the first version

Better.. Install Bitcoin atm and do regular cash. Btc now is too slow. Or go with lightning, Ripple or nano

saying "spiritual guru" doesnt make one automatically a spiritual guru. there is much more to it than babbling about world events and letting the ego run full steam. sexual attraction creates popularity. its really a simple phenomenon. there is nothing else to it..

I am running  and accept bitcoin.
reason simple:
* no friendly fraud (charge backs)
* no 15-20% transaction fees
* mobile transaction fees are sometimes 60-70%
* Bitcoin like 1-2%
if 90% of my customers were using crypto i would be super happy. right now its 10%

you are wrong and there is a simple reason why:
even countries compete against each other.
japan fully supporting crypto will force others to do the same... over the longterm because otherwise there will be major drainage of capital. imagine switzerland creating all kinds of neat crypto innovations improving ICOs etc. all the capital would go there.
since everyone is greedy everyone will support it.
same with gambling.. why isnt all gambling by the state?

unless there is major development it will take over a year. next bubble will only come with mainstream adoption. everyone else is already in it. so unless your grandma can access bitcoin without being aware she is using it there wont be any more big bubbles
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:32:36
in short its a question of volume.
if you do 1 million in transactions monthly 2% or 1% or 5% fees is a lot of money

coinbase closed 2 of my accounts... bitpay and coinbase represent whats wrong... i think they are just preparing themselves to be sold off to larger entities like paypal. thats their whole spiel. its like they dont care about individual customers anymore
