So you have no problem with your idea of bitcoin being worthless and having no security because the market decided they didn't want it? As long as it's got the right features according to you, who cares what the market thinks right?
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:11:42
Wait, so, you *don't* think the market should decide? In fact you think the idea is ridiculous, given that you mocked the committee idea above and now saying letting the market decide is "just as" bad.
Serious question, why do you think the market's idea of what should happen to Bitcoin is so wrong?

Whether he meant that part sarcastically or not, I think it's hilarious that you are taking such umbrage to this point, and missed the main idea which is to "let the market decide" which by the sounds of it you agree with, as opposed to what is currently happening (letting developers who happened to get involved years ago decide).

Yes, and then if they subsequently rise further to say $500, and you sell them at that point that's a further capital gain of $100 on top of the taxable income of $400. Or if you sell them immediately then it's only income, no capital gains.

I think a bitcoin gain refers to the price increase in USD of bitcoin you're holding. If you are paid in bitcoin, that's not the same, you would have regular income tax on the based on its value in USD at the time you can received it, and then any subsequent change in value of that bitcoin you're now holding would be subject to to further capital gains or losses.

Well, as the price of bitcoin increases, the amount of money going into mining it on a daily basis will tend to increase in tandem. That can be a hefty environmental issue. Now, I'm on the side of those who believe it's worth it, but it's not exactly a non-issue.

How would this work? It would presumably need some sort of centralized service, otherwise how would you guarantee that once wallet A receives the coins from wallet B, that wallet A doesn't go rogue and refuse to send the equivalent amount back to B?
Also, no one is going to want their coins randomly tied up at inopportune times. So presumably they would only turn this on at certain times want they feel the need for a bit of mixing and know they won't need their coins right away. Of course then it makes it that much harder to find someone else in the area willing to trade if everyone's doing that.

Really? I didn't think it was that negative on bitcoin.

Wouldn't this require a randomisation? If not wouldn't it be possible for pool A to figure out which range of nonces pool B is trying, and if they have marginally higher hash rate, beat them to the punch thereby rendering pool B ineffective? I know the solution depends on the choice of transactions to include, but if there is some standard algorithm maybe that can be figured out too?

OK, situation: The exchange rate is $460/BTC. A new TV costs $460. Are you asking if the same store will take less than 1 BTC for it? Maybe a little because they save on credit card fees, or otherwise want to promote bitcoin. But not a significant amount, because then no one would pay in USD if they knew they could get the better deal by paying in BTC.
Or are you considering the hypothetical situation where there is only the deflationary currency? If so, what does it mean that people would "pay less"? Pay less compared to what? If you only have the one currency, there's no other one to compare it to and say you're paying less.
Basically, I don't see how your question makes sense.
Edit: I guess fundamentally it boils down to this: If people are so sure that the "deflationary currency" is going up in value while the "inflationary currency" is going down, then people will sell that inflationary currency to buy the deflationary one, until such point as the one currency fails or the inflationary/deflationary aspects are priced in and no one expects the exchange rate to move in one direction for certain anymore.

That's already true, so what?


All bitcoin has do is double in price on average once every 4 years for the mining reward to stay as relevant as it is today. Historically the price has been rising a lot faster than that. Conservatively, maybe 5 times per year, or 500 times in 4 years. It's not even close.

Yes, but if so many people are so sure that the one currency is undervalued compared to the other then they will keep buying up the undervalued currency until the price moves to such an extent that on average people no longer consider it undervalued. Because at that point and only at that point supply equals demand and the price stops moving.

When westerners think about large numbers, they think about how many times they need to divide it by 1000 to get to a number less than 1000, and then express the number xyz 000 000 000 ... as X hundred and Y-ty -Z thousand-thousand-thousand ... etc. (where a thousand thousand is a million, a thousand thousand thousand is a billion, etc. The common pattern is we think and express numbers in terms of 10s, 100s and 1000s as the basic building blocks. Japanese do the same but they go one level higher up to 10000s. The names are Ichi (1), Juu (10), Hyaku (100), Sen (1000), and Man (10000). So they would express 21000000 as 2100,0000, ie.

I looked at the charts and the maximum overnight change in the the USD/CAD ratio, which was about 2%. Now, you probably don't have all your assets in USD, so the amount your wealth - measured in CAD - went up because of this currency is probably quite a bit less than that. Less than 2% is not what I would call "significant". Maybe it is for you. But it not even close to the same scale of what bitcoin has been doing on a regular basis over the last month.


That's not what I said though. Why did I even bother addressing your first point when this qualification you added to the debate completely changes the subject we are talking about?

That's the target but actual rate of blocks being found depends on hash rate and difficulty. Before the difficulty adjustment the rate is faster than the target (it was around 1 block per 8 min). Immediately after the rate is back to the target of 1 block per 10 min or so in theory, but starts increasing again as hash rate continues to rise.
In conclusion, yes the difficulty adjustment does cause a temporary reduction in the number of blocks being found per day.

Look, I get it that you're a libertarian, and I basically am too, but you are purposely changing the question. So I'm going to ignore that part of your answer because it has absolutely nothing to do with this discussion. I am talking about very specific laws that I quoted, not "the law" in general.
You are indeed in the minority in stating that accessory to murder is not immoral. By "accessory" I mean you were aware that it was likely to happen, and despite that, you chose actions which you knew would enable it. Is that a clear enough definition for you?
Civil discourse requires defending a claim which goes against the majority opinion. Otherwise you have no credibility.
Ross Ulbricht has nothing to do with this discussion. I responded to your claim that providing someone with cyanide so that they could poison someone else was not immoral. That's not something that Ross did, and neither of us claimed it. I also responded to your claim that supplying someone with whisky when you knew they were likely to drive drunk was not immoral. Ross didn't do that either. So why are you bringing him into this discussion?

You're missing the point. The exchange knows which account they went to. It's the same account that deposited them. Otherwise how did that account acquire those coins to withdraw them?
Email or registration has nothing to do with it. The exchange knows that bitcoin address X deposited coins to exchange account Y, and then exchange account Y withdrew coins to bitcoin address Z. Therefore address X and address Z are owned by the same person. They don't have to know anything identifying about that person, email or otherwise.

It doesn't matter what the PoW algorithm is. In an efficient market, energy cost of mining will rise to meet the value of the coins mined. The only reason litecoin is using less energy is because the value of coins produced per day is lower.
If the price of BTC rises, it means that the value of the coins mined previously is now worth more than the cost of the energy used to produce them. This is a point in bitcoin's favour from the energy-cost point of view.
Non-renewable energy will be consumed one way or another. If anything, using some of it to go towards mining bitcoin will mean energy prices will rise to compensate for the lower supply, and consequently less energy will be used for other things. It comes down to what kind of world do you want to live in: one where the growth economy sustained by fiat is destroying our planet due to over consumption, or one where a stable-supply currency keeps growth in check?
If you are worried about environmental costs of energy use, you should be advocating for a price on carbon or something. The idea of altruistically decreasing energy consumption when it goes *against* our individual economic interests is very strange.
Edit: Also bitcoin mining is more likely to use more renewable and less environmentally damaging energy production types, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, etc. because there is no need to transport the energy, you can use it at the location where it is being produced. Of course, this is a problem for centralization, but that is a separate issue.

Off the top of my head, to make the expected time of the next difficulty adjustment jump from 2 weeks to a year (52 weeks), you'd have to decrease the hash rate by a factor of 26, bringing it to roughly 4% of its original value, i.e. you'd have to knock out 96% of the hash rate. I'm pretty sure that's more than just the "top miners".
Not to mention this only works if you're at the beginning of the difficulty adjustment cycle.

There are already ideas, maybe even plans, to put a full node in an orbiting satellite that could relay transactions, thereby keeping the blockchain connected. Failing that, some other communication medium (radio, telephone) that could get around the "split in the internet" would be exploited.
Any blocks that don't get seen by the majority of nodes are pretty well useless, and will likely be orphaned when the internet gets reconnected.

So.. what's the problem? Bitcoin is adding $24,000 of net wealth to the world economy per hour. Why is that a bad thing? If the cost of mining was more than the value produced by said mining, I would see it as a problem, but as is, things seem to be working perfectly.
Edit: Consider the similar situation with gold mining. World produced 2,770 metric tons of gold in 2013. That's 9.7709e+7 ounces. At an average price of around $1400/ounce, that's around $135 billion. So, let's say the cost to produce that gold was $65 billion. Would you say "Oh no! Cost of gold mining is a significant fraction of it's value! Better stop!" Who would listen to you? On the contrary, people would think, "Wow, what a lucrative industry. Roughly 100% profits on cost of production. I should get into this!"

Ha! I'm 100% bitcoin (I've never bought any altcoins), if you need to know. For two reasons: I absolutely agree the other altcoins have practically no chance (less than 1%), and the additional bother of diversifying into said altcoins is not actually worth the effort.
But OP said an investor needs to pick his favorite altcoin and go 100% all in, and my original statement was refuting that, talking about a hypothetical situation where an investor believes another altcoin does have a significant chance, and he can't decide which one will win, even if he agrees there will be one winner. So if you're going to criticize, please understand the hypothetical situation I proposed, instead of saying that said situation is impossible, which it may or may not be but that's not the point.

For that scenario to make sense with LIFO you would have to have just bought the same amount of BTC that you then sold a minute later. I don't see why the IRS would have a problem with that. You could imagine that you sold the original BTC you bought a year ago, while pretending to the IRS that you sold the BTC that you just bought. It's not going to help you screw over the IRS though, because you might as well have just not bought and resold a minute later and you'd be just as well off.

Small technical inaccuracy (at 3:52), which I'm not sure whether you glossed over on purpose for the sake of brevity (if you did I don't particularly blame you because it's not easy to explain this briefly):
The "correct" chain is not necessarily the longest one in terms of number of blocks, but rather the one with the most collective difficulty. This is important because otherwise there could be an attack where a separate chain has a really low difficulty and so it would be simple for a small amount of attacking hashrate (i.e. way less than 50%) to generate a lot of blocks really fast and thereby generate the longest valid chain (but it wouldn't be the one with the longest collective difficulty).

I see your point, however I think "top miners" is still misleading, because it suggests to me a few of the biggest mining farms, not all of them, which I guess is what it would take to wipe out 96% of the hash rate.
Anyway, to address your point, I really hope mining doesn't ever get this centralized. Maybe the threat of being attacked like this will keep the mining farms to a reasonable size? Also, I think the effect of this type of attack would be more limited if difficulty adjusted constantly (every block, but based on the previous x where x could still be 2016), instead of once every 2016 blocks.

Good point. My example referred to the case where a restaurant might not even know what the tip is, so even if BitPay did steal that tip, there would be no way for the restaurant to notice. However, BitPay would probably have no way of knowing the tip either, so I guess my example doesn't really hold up.

Careful - your numbers are wrong. 387.88 - 128.47 = 259.41
259.41/128.47 = about 201%
So there was a 201% increase from this time last year, not 301%. 
For example, if the price went from $100 to $110, you call that a 10% increase, not a 110% increase.

Don't worry, everyone knows you're a troll, so I'm not worried about your personal insults. Anyway, all of what you said regarding the question at hand is obvious and at the same time unhelpful, because it hasn't answered OP's question, why is the price dropping? You are no better than the people who say "because supply &gt; demand". It's a tautology. If you want to be helpful, you need to explain why supply is currently greater than demand. And as I point out, supply was known in advance, so the question boils down to why demand has dropped since the time when the price was skyrcketing. And you haven't answered that, so your answer is once again, completely useless.

Two points:
1. Bitcoin's Money stock (M1) is much bigger than that of  many of the smaller countries. (  So some of them could buy up as many bitcoins as they need to run their country, and the affect on the supply and thus price of bitcoin would be negligible.
2. Of course they'd be making their preexisting currency worthless in the process, so the question is what are they buying the bitcoin with?? Well, if they used say 1% of their money stock to buy bitcoin, no one would really notice their currency dropping in value that much. And then if bitcoin went up in value by a factor of 100 as it did in 2013, then they're set. So yeah, they'd have to get kind of lucky, or it would have to take kind of a long time.

Further comments: When you talk about "what's backing it", and then go on to explain "nothing is, just everyone's faith", and then no one can spend anyone else's money", I would suggest adding: "no one can tamper with the ledger to create their own money from nowhere, just by hacking it".. or summarize that to "Further, the ledger is essentially tamper-proof because there are so many copies of it around the world that everyone agrees on".

Why would people fear 1% of all the bitcoin suddenly "coming back fom the dead"? The fed increases the supply of dollars on a regular basis by that much (maybe not instantaneously, but certainly over a short period of time) and it doesn't mean people panic and get rid of their dollars. And with bitcoin, you know it can only happen so many times before all the hoarders are cashed out.

The minimum fee is basically a "suggestion" in various wallet implementations, not hardcoded into the protocol itself. It can change in the future. Sometimes transactions with no fee go through.
Edit: Furthermore, the fee is meant to help offset the cost of mining, so if the BTC/USD ratio goes up, and the cost of mining stays relatively the same, then the transaction fee can go down accordingly.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:23:29


Engineering is not my area of expertise. However I do know this about negative feedback: it basically means stability - when there is a perturbation, (a small change in some variable due to outside forces), the negative feedback would give the effect of sending the value back towards the value it had before the perturbation, as opposed to positive feedback, which would make it go even farther from that starting point.

Yeah but if they continued with plan A, they might soon find the "next block" that follows the one they're withholding and publish both the withheld one and the newly found one and then those together would orphan the block the other miner found!
Edit: After thinking about it for a bit, it seems this would work if they could expect to find their next block before the other miners together could find two in a row. And it seems that (probabilisitically speaking) would require only 1/3 of the hash power.

Yeah, I have to agree on your first point, but this only applies to the riot scenario, of the four.

A currency (or anything else) gains value by having a limited supply and increasing demand. Demand is tricky because a big part of it is speculation on the value, so there's a complex feedback mechanism involved. At the base of it though, there has to be some fundamental reason for the demand.
Bitcoin has limited supply because it's programmed in. It has demand because it's a useful way of transacting and storing value, and it's arguably the most efficient and cheapest such method (in theory at least, i.e. if/when it becomes widely used), and has a bunch of other advantages that national currencies don't have (global, decentralized, sort of anonymous, invisble, etc.).
National currencies have a sort-of limited supply, but the supply is typically increasing slowly and unpredictably when money keeps getting printed. You might not notice it on the year-to-year basis but over about 10-20 years it adds up. 
Demand for national currencies occurs because the citizens have to pay their taxes in national currency or else they go to jail, and also to a lesser extent their status as legal tender.

I was thinking that in this scenario, it would be possible for everyone to agree to a fork where the Satoshi bitcoins are no longer considered valid.  I mean, we would do this if we had some way of knowing that this is what Satoshi wanted. However, the problem with this is just that: If 
Satoshi doesn't have access to his keys because he burned them, how do we verify that he is really Satoshi, and this his wishes are really to do this fork? It's a catch-22.

Anyway, my theory's pretty simple, but you disagree. Let's explore your theory a bit more, because it's not comopletely clear to me. What if you think one currency has a 50.000001% chance, and the other has a 49.999999% chance. Do you still go 100%/0%? If not, what's the percentage chance that one currency would have to have (in your opinion), for you to decide it's worth going all in?

Currently, I think price is leading hashrate down, and hashrate going down is causing price to stop dropping. In other words, a negative feedback loop, which should cause stabilization in both price and hashrate.
In other words, a bottom. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 05:02:51
Whoa! You got your whole point backwards, so your conclusion is the opposite of what it should be. 
Hoarding increases the price, yes, which decreases, not increases volatility. Just think, if the price went down to $.10 per bitcoin, that would mean a market cap of $1.3 million. Anybody could sneeze and the market would go up or down by a factor of 2. Instead, as it is, it takes millions of $ to make the market move a few percent. If the price went up to $100000, all the biggest holders would have cashed out for the most part by then and there would be way less power to move the market.

I'd like to see it set up so that anytime you upvote someone, it automatically pays them x bitcoins, where x can be set to anything. Default would be 0; minimum 1 satoshi = roughly $.00000361 at the time of writing. First people to use it would be the people that are currently changetipping (and these people would presumably set their default to something like $.01, something they could afford but would at least be nontrivial..), people that get upvoted with bitcoin would get a onetime message telling them about it, and then maybe everytime their account balance hits a significant milestone... 10, 100, 1000, 10000 satoshis etc. Eventually people would just start spreading the tips around organically without thinking about it.

First you need two concepts, derivative and resultant.
The derivative of a function f(x) is a new function f'(x) that gives the slope of the graph of y=f(x) at any point x. The derivative of the of the function x^3 +ax+b with respect to x is 3x^2 +a. In other words the slope of the graph of y=x^3 +ax+b at the point x=7 is 3(7)^2 +a.
The **resultant** of two polynomials (in x) is basically achieved by solving for x in one of the polynomials and plugging that value into the other. (There is a more technical definition, but this one is sufficient for now.) It's important because if the resultant of two polynomials is 0, then those two polynomials must have a common factor x-t (or equivalently, a common root, a value of x which makes the polynomial =0). 
The **discriminant** of a polynomial is simply the resultant of the polynomial with its derivative. In our case, the discriminant is the resultant of x^3 +ax+b with its derivative 3x^2 +a. To calculate this, we solve for x in the second, and get x = (-a/3)^(1/2), and plugging that into x^3 +ax+b we get (-a/3)^(3/2) +a(-a/3)^(1/2) +b, which can be written as (-a/3)^(3/2) -3(-a/3)(-a/3)^(1/2) +b, or -2(-a/3)^(3/2) +b. Now, if this is 0, then b=2(-a/3)^(3/2) , and squaring both sides we get b^2 = 4(-a/3)^3 =-4/27 a^3 . Equivalently 27b^2 =-4a^3 .

Wikipedia: Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law.
Investopedia: Currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity.
Dictionary.com: paper currency made legal tender by a fiat of the government, but not based on or convertible into coin.
ft.com: Paper money or coins of little or no intrinsic value in themselves and not convertible into gold or silver, but made legal tender by fiat (order) of the government. 
Bitcoin doesn't fit any of those definitions, because intrinsic to all of them is the idea that the declaration that fiat money has value comes from the government. That is what fiat literally means.

Wrong. 99% of the miners can do whatever they want, but if they do something really stupid, the rest of us will just ignore them, and poof! the coins on that new fork are instantly worthless.
The decision as to whether to accept a new fork rests with all the people that collectively give bitcoin value, and that includes miners, speculators, traders, hodlers, merchants, remitters, journaists, experts, developers, etc. etc. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:49:39
Sorry no. The context here is a guy who was recovering from a stroke not understanding the question. You could have the same interview with a thousand random strangers and at least 10% of them would say something at least as "incriminating". Had she done this, following the same logic would result in naming each of those 100 other guys as being Satoshi. In other words, this so called "evidence" is nothing more than weakly circumstantial, and she based her whole case on it. That is blatant and reckless disregard for the truth. You want to know what a proper journalist would have done when she thought some random dude with no obvious connection to bitcoin just kind of sounded like he was admitting to being Satoshi? Start by assuming he misheard or misspoke, and then ask him again to say it on record. She did not do that, or maybe she did and he denied it, and then she just didn't tell us about that part.
Anyway, I'm not the first to say this, so I don't know why I'm bothering. Read the other 3 independent articles (linked from newsweeklied.com) all calling out the sloppy journalism, and then get back to me with why they're all wrong.

If the price were ten times higher tomorrow, and miners thought it wasn't overpriced, they would still only be selling enough to recoup costs, i.e. the same $ value that they are selling now.
Of course, the mining industry would do its best to catch up (ramp up the hashrate), but it wouldn't be instantaneous.
Edit: well some of it would be instantaneous (whatever miners are sitting idle now). But I am quite sure we could not increase hashrate by a factor of 10 overnight.

Another thing to note: There was a big run from $5 to $12 in the 6 months prior to the halving. Then after the halving it went from $12 to $260 over the next 4.5 months, and then up to around $1150 in the 7.5 months after that.

A hacker who wanted to steal your money would not wait to steal it.
However, it's also possible that no hacker has thought of the right hack yet, but some hacker will think of the right hack very soon. Your bitcoins are not safe. *Edit: You seem to be only worried about the case where the hacker had already compromised your system while you generated the address. I agree that in that case, the more time that goes by the less likely it is that your coins are unsafe.

Thank you. Whether bitcoin is "desirable and competitive" is decided by *the users, the people that give it value*, not the miners.
Not to mention that for your scenario to become applicable (block reward + transaction fee no longer providing economic incentive sufficient to maintain mining security), bitcoin would have to have already failed as a currency. At that point, relaxing the 21 million limit will only make things worse.

That number is 52 or 53, depending on your interpretation of this statement:


The second thing is, even if the precision matched, the biggest number of millions less than 2^51 / 10^8 = 2251799813685248/10^8 = 22,517,998 is 22, not 21.
So, once again, can you explain your theory in more detail, or did I just prove that you have no idea what you're talking about?

This would keep confirmation times extra high, yes. But it wouldn't kill the network entirely. Meanwhile, there would be a huge economic incentive for miners to defect. I'd guess it would only work if there was some massive conspiracy, which is hard to fathom actually happening.

All the naysayers: OP is saying that the increased publicity from all those changetips will bring in more new users (i.e. demand) that will send the price up. It's a completely plausible argument, though you may disagree with it.
My argument against this would be that the price is going to go up eventually anyway, but it might take longer. So you don't actually need to give away half your riches as long as you're willing to wait it out.

Miners act as individuals, not as a collective. There is an economic incentive for them to not change the 21 million limit (if they did, the value of bitcoin would evaporate, and their whole enterprise would go bust). Put those two facts together, and you will realize that any miner that forks in that way is simply shooting himself in the foot because the new fork's coins will be worthless.

I'm kind of lost as to what your point is, and what it has to do with my point. Maybe I'm just tired. Are you arguing that there's no way to know which crypto-currency will win, and so it's like a random lottery, and as such inherently unfair? Are you taking into account the network effect?

@_date: 2015-01-09 00:10:54
OK, that's better, but it's still not how the markets work, mathematically speaking. It would be better to do a weighted average of people's "can't resist" price, weighted by their "buying power". For example, if I think a bitcoin is worth a billion kajillion dollars, but I only have 1 penny to invest, then my opinion has no effect on the price. Whereas a whale that thinks it is only worth $5 more than its current exchange rate, but has 5 million dollars to invest, well that whale will actually change the price all by him or herself.
Anyway, a weighted average as described above would be better still, but it still wouldn't capture the idea exactly. Basically, it's just markets. You can't really define it any other way.
Edit: I'm not really trying to take away from your main point, which is entirely valid. I am just pointing out that technically, your explanation for where the floor is is not exactly accurate.

What if the lottery was weighted by the size of your transaction fee? i.e. the higher the fee you paid to the miners, the bigger your chance of getting the reward. This would certainly inhibit spam. 
Of course it would have to be a hybrid with the current setup, because miners still need to be paid, and not just with fees.

That's not really how it works. The average is probably somewhere close to $.01 if you take into account everyone in the world including people who have never heard of Bitcoin. But if even one person thinks it's worth $1, and has enough money to buy up all the bitcons at that price, then it's definitely worth more than $1. And I can guarantee that at least one person in the world would do that.

Two things:
1. In bitcoin, this "problem" is much less than in other cryptos. I don't think I need to explain why, even taking into account Satoshi's stash.
2. Why is this a problem? Do these people not deserve some financial reward for their risk? What else will they do with all their crypto-stash? Dump it on the market? If they do, it's no longer a problem, so problem solved. Or, are you worried they will be too powerful and somehow control the world Dr. Evil-style? Really? If they did, do you think the rest of us would keep using that coin?
Edit: my response was a bit exaggerated maybe, but I guess I am asking you to spell out your worst fears because I think you may be overthinking things. 
Edit 2: Note that, in limited-supply crypto, the coin distribution tends to even out over time, so whatever unfair distribution there is to begin with eventually dies down (maybe gradually).

If it's a full-time job and you're fairly good at it, you can make money trading. For example, some exchanges are slower to react than others. If you choose such a one, and react faster than everyone else on that exchange to what the other exchanges are doing, you can reliably expect to beat the other traders/investors on that exchange. And profit. But you basically have to be better at it than everyone else. It's very risky. And as some have pointed out, a negative-sum game, so  by definition, you can only win a bit less than what the others playing the same game are losing.

The deed is a legal document that is owned by someone, say person X, in real life. The colored coins may represent a claim by person Y to that deed as part of a contract person Y signed with person X. If the colored coins are gone, that claim is gone, and the contract is void. The actual owner of the deed, person X, remains the owner of the property, in the absence of any other contract stating otherwise.
In other words, colored coins are not replacements for deeds, they are amendments to them.

That's not how percentages work.
The price one year ago was 614.09/216.09 = 2.8418 = 284.18% higher than it is now.
The price now is 614.09/883.1 = 0.695 = 69.5% lower than it was 1 year ago.
It's a different number depending on which direction you go.

"In a currency war each round of escalation is the process of making your currency worth less. And in this war, Canada is a full participant. 
As economists repeatedly tell us, the falling loonie is bad for Canadians who want to travel abroad. It also makes life more expensive for people who want to buy foreign goods, from European cars to South Korean washing machines.
Boost to exports
China Rising Yuan
Central banks around the world, including China, have been cutting interest rates, pushing down the value of their currencies. (Associated Press)
But on the bright side, they tell us, it will be good for the Canadian economy.
Our products will become cheaper in foreign markets, boosting our industrial economy as we export more to the thriving U.S. economy.
And while working to encourage Canadians to holiday at home and shop at home, it will make people with higher currencies want to shop and travel in Canada.
Weak loonie will sway snowbirds, cross-border shopping
**Of course that only works if everyone else's currency stays high. And in currency wars that's not what happens.**
The ruble is down by half. The euro has hit 11-year lows after countries using it began printing money. Japan has been printing money, too. Denmark has cut interest rates to keep the krone from surging against the falling euro.
India and China have cut. Yesterday, Singapore joined the pack, saying it was worried about deflation. "

Thanks. I agree with you on both points, for what it's worth, though I'm not an expert bitcoiner. There will be some distribution in efficiency of miners, hence they will turn back on at different times (or some will be paying closer attention than others to their prospective transaction fees).

@_date: 2016-01-22 23:28:47
Sorry I've had a hell of a day today, haven't had time to reply. But what it boils down to, as the top three comments here say, is that the cost of each block is mostly governed by the coinbase reward (currently 25 BTC), not the measly &lt;1 BTC fee currently being collected. So calculating the cost per transaction is meaningless. The transactions have *almost* nothing to do with the cost. No I won't do the search for all the other threads on this topic for you. At least not today. I haven't had breakfast yet, and it's now dinner time.
Edit: Also, note that the money spent is not being consumed for the service of securing the transaction. It still exists - in the form of bitcoin. So a miner buying electricity with USD to mine bitcoin achieves the same thing economically as a trader on the exchange buying bitcoin directly with his USD.
It's equivalent if you think in terms of energy. Say a guy with solar panels has energy to sell back to the grid. He can either sell it, or mine bitcoins with it.
Situation A: If he chooses to mine bitcoins, was that energy wasted?
Situation B: What if he sells it back to the grid for USD and then goes on an exchange and buys bitcoins with his USD? Was the energy wasted?
I'm sure in situation B you would say the energy was not wasted, it was used. But the two situations achieve the exact same effect. In fact Situation A is *more efficient*, because there is no middle man. So the energy was not wasted there either.

In other words, 27b^2 =-4a^3 is the condition for the function x^3 +ax+b to have a common factor with its derivative. And this is equivalent to the condition that x^3 +ax+b has a repeated root, (or repeated factor, same thing). Why? Because if you have a polynomial of the form f(x)=(x-t)^2 g(x) and you take the derivative with respect to x, the x-t factor will show up in both terms of the product rule for derivatives. But if it's of the form f(x)=(x-t) g(x) and x-t is not a factor of g(x), then x-t will only be a factor of one of the terms of the product rule, so overall it won't be a factor of the derivative.
Now, consider what happens if we really have 27b^2 =-4a^3. We can rewrite a=-3c^2 . Then b = 2c^3, so that the above equation reads 108c^6 =108c^6 . Then x^3 +ax+b becomes x^3 -3c^2 x +2c^3. And this factors as (x-c)^2 (x+2c). If you now graph the curve y=x^3 + ax+b = (x-c)^2 (x+2c) you see it will only cross the x-axis in two places (x=c and x=-2c) instead of the usual three places. So the curve looks qualitatively different in this case.

You've started to give vaguely plausible reasons, but have provided no precise data to back it up, and have given no reason as to why the price stopped going up and started going down when it did. Here's a clue: the price crashed last April because Gox failed. Then it went up because of massive publicity and spiked because Gox disallowed fiat withdrawals before they disallowed BTC withdrawal, so everyone on Gox was buying BTC to cash out. Then it crashed again when Gox disallowed BTC withdrawals. There, an evidence-based theory. I don't know how correct it is, but it's a hell of a lot better than your mindless "BTC's a scam and always has been" idiocy, because that is clearly disproven by the facts on the ground, and does nothing to answer OP's question.

This is not a guess, it is a calculation based on known facts. The 3 facts are: 
* that the bitcoin code sets difficulty so that blocks are mined on average once per 10 minutes, 
* the bitcoin code set the initial reward at 50 BTC,
* the bitcoin code specifies that the reward per block drops by 50% every 4 years.
These are facts. I didn't make them up. And if you do the calculation, the result is that there are 21 million total bitcoins when they are all mined. That is math, based on facts. No guessing involved. How can you not understand this?

I kind of see what you're saying.. But I don't believe it applies to this situation. I'm talking about a long term stable situation. The average hash rate per block would stay relatively constant over the two week cycle, so the difficulty would not be way off the target needed to achieve 10 min blocks. The variance in hash rate would come within the ten minute (or so) block finding period, but stay stable over the longer term 2week difficulty adjustment period.

The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of Challenger, saying that it was seriously flawed:


— Rogers Commission Report Chapter V[14]
Richard Feynman[edit]
One of the commission's best-known members was theoretical physicist Richard Feynman. ... In the appendix, he argued that the **estimates of reliability offered by NASA management were wildly unrealistic, differing as much as a thousandfold from the estimates of working engineers. "For a successful technology," he concluded, "reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."**

No. If you're measuring those price increases in BTC/USD, the effect of a depreciating USD on the ratio BTC/USD is direct and immediate, by definition.

Increasing the *average* block size by a certain amount, when the average is already near the maximum, is by definition more of a drastic change than increasing the *maximum* blocksize by the same amount. The former has in practice actually increased node infrastructure requirements while the latter would not necessarily do so.
*Unless* you are suggesting that 1MB is some magic threshold above which bitcoin node requirements obey different laws, in which case you should provide the calculation that results in this magic number.

is claiming that's the inflation rate, i.e. if a loaf of bread costs $1 today it'll be $1.456 this time next year.
You're talking about a "decay in the value of the currency" rate, which is not standard. If the inflation rate is inf, then your "decay rate" is equal to dec = 1-(1/(1+inf)).
Now, did not account for compounding (his comment simple extrapolation, not APR). That is:
inf = 365.25 x .00125 = .456 = 45.6%.
The correct calculation including compounding is:
inf = 1.00125^365.25 - 1 = .578 = 57.8% inflation.
And what you calculated, the decay rate, is as follows:
dec = 1-1/(1+inf) = 1-1/(1.578) = .366 = 36.6%.
In other words this is even farther than historical inflation, and that much less likely.

The theory is that a big reason for the wealth inequality today is that whenever money is printed the vast majority of it goes more or less directly into the pockets of the already rich. With Bitcoin that is basically a non issue. Anyone is free to mine, it is not free money (i.e. you have to take a risk buying expensive miners etc.), and the growth of the Bitcoin money supply is limited, and will eventually stop.

Judging by your answer, I'd say you are vastly overestimating the importance of this psychological effect, and understimating people's intelligence. No one from other countries with lower valued currencies (China, Japan, etc. ) has trouble understanding the USD. And your terrorist example? If people are not turning in terrorists, it's for other reasons, not because they don't understand whether  million dollars would be a good thing or not.
Edit: Also, this psychological effect, small as it is, is also easy to overcome. Just change to a different denomination. For a while during late 2013 everyone on this sub was like "Hey! Let's switch everything to mBTC because an mBTC is kind of like a dollar." It sort of caught on for a while. Then the price dropped and that idea kind of fell by the wayside.

You seem to be under the impression that there is some inherent economic reason why a unit of one currency should have a similar value to a unit of another currency. There's not. There may be a psychological reason why it might be useful, but that would never be enough to overcome the more important factors that affect the value, like supply annd demand.

Well, the post has been removed, so I can't verify the $0 vs. $0.01 debate. I was pretty sure you wrote $0 - if you had written $0.01 I don't think I would have replied, but whatever, it's a moot point now.

For every mined block, the miner is rewarded with 25 brand spanking new bitcoins. Every 4 years, this reward goes down by half, and the next such "halvening" is scheduled for about July 27 next year. See  for the most up to date prediction. So in around a year, the reward will drop to 12.5 bitcoins per block. A lot of people speculate that the reduced supply will cause an increase in price around that time. Something like that happened around the time of the last halvening.

This only makes sense as an incentive to decntralize mining if the fee is removed and replaced by an equal miner-specific output. Otherwise, you're just making a donation to a specific miner, which is costing you more and thus not viable as a long term solution.
Given that, you now have the other problem that you're now waiting extra long for that first confirmation, because only the miner that you're paying with the direct miner output has an incentive to mine it.
Finally how can you ever know that a "smaller miner" is not just a bigger miner in sheep's clothing?

Well, when I first loaded it, the 0 satsperbyte category predicted 1-2 blocks, 1-10 spb was 0-1 block and the rest were 0 blocks. By the time I finished typing my comment and checked again, all categories were predicting 0-1 blocks at least. Even now while I'm typing things are different again. I'd call it consistent if the predictions change maybe on the hourly scale, rather than every couple minutes or so.

But, the spammer could be sending himself the coin, so the actual amount of BTC going to the destination address does not count as part of his cost, only the fees do. (In this case, he is sending some to voat, for whatever reason, but he doesn't have to.)
Edit: You're right that this would cut down on certain types of spam, namely, those where the recipients are receiving worthless coin i.e. that costs more to use than it's worth. In that sense, it's a good idea. However, my point is it would not not cut down on spamming the blockchain with transactions that go between two addresses owned by the spammer. Presumably most spam is of the former variety though.

Yes, but it takes a while for that to happen, since basically more miners have to be manufactured (the ones that are offline and can be turned back on are typically old ones which are not very efficient compared to the newer models, so they will have a smaller effect).

This would work if there was some way to specify that the output could go to any miner that wasnt on a given list. I am pretty sure the protocol doesn't currently allow for this, but I don't see why it couldn't. You'd still have to wait somewhat longer for confirmation because the miners you left out would be effectively removed from the hash rate, but you might not care so much about that.
@_date: 2015-07-12 04:01:17
Bitcoin mining involves finding new blocks (of transactions) every 10 min. or so. To do this, a miner has to make a guess at a certain number called a *nonce*, do some computation called a *hash*  (this process is called *hashing*) that depends on that number and the bitcoin transactions the miner wants to include in the block, and see if the result is less than some other number (which is inversely proportional to the difficulty, more on that below). If it is less, the block is valid, and the miner publishes the block and wins the reward (currently 25 BTC). Of course, the higher the difficulty, the harder it is to find such a nonce that has the right property.
The hash rate represents how many hashes the collective of all the bitcoin miners can perform in a given amount of time. So, like 100 petahashes/second (or whatever the number currently is). If more people start mining, or they start using better miners, that number goes up.
Difficulty is a number (an integer in fact) that represents how difficult it is to mine a new block. The higher the number, the harder it is to mine. This difficulty is periodically adjusted automatically by the bitcoin algorithm (approximately once every 2 weeks, or to be more precise, once every 2016 blocks). The idea behind the readjustment is that if the collective miners out there get better at their job (increase their hash rate), they will start mining blocks faster. Satoshi wanted a relatively steady rate of coin production, so to compensate for changes in the hash rate, the difficulty is periodically adjusted so that it is roughly proportional to the hash rate. With the net result being that blocks are found on average once per 10 minutes.

Why do you think this is such a big deal? The biggest problem with people losing bitcoins historically is having them stolen due to lax security, and or forgetting about them and losing the keys. I have never heard of people losing bitcoins due to typos. Not to mention, it's actually pretty hard to send bitcoin to a wrong address.

The transactions would have to be all double spends of each other, because if they all get picked up (by even the miners that didn't mine the block), then you're paying more than you can afford, and its not sustainable.

This is equivalent to mining the full amount and then send half the mined coins to a burn address. It's absurd. No one would voluntarily do that.
In fact, you can burn half your coins and you don't even have to be a miner. Good luck with that.
The fault in your logic is that the halvening is not voluntary, so it ushers in an era with a different economic model than the old one.

Exponential growth is natural, not linear growth, because math. Typically in the short term, the amount that something grows per year is proportional to the amount that currently exists, based on the network effect. The mathematical equation for this is 
rate of growth per year = k × amount already existing,
where k is the proportionality constant. Or, using symbols,
 dy/dt = k × y
The solution of this equation is
y = y0 × e^k×t ,
amount existing = initial amount × e^k×number_of_years .
Of course, if the proportionality constant is small enough, it may look like linear growth, but when there is a noticeable difference, it's exponential growth that's natural.

The shot where they show someone transacting with paypal on their phone is still in the "new money" section. It should be in the old money section, and the "new money" section should show someone paying with bitcoin. And it should mention that "old money" (such as paypal) requires a central third party, whereas bitcoin doesn't.

~~As far as I understand you don't have to wait before resending with a higher fee. When the higher-fee transaction is accepted, the original one will be considered invalid and dropped.~~ This was apparently wrong. Nodes reject such transactions as attempted double-spends.
That being said, I agree that such a policy may inhibit spam. But there is a downside as well: it will prevent low-fee transactions where you don't care how long they take. Currently such transactions tend to get picked up in times of low activity.

A couple comments: Why do you say


The estimate for how long until the next block is 10 minutes, a little less if the hash rate has increased since last difficulty change so then maybe 8 or 9. For it to get as low as 5 the hash rate would have to have doubled since the last difficulty change. If you're accounting for random chance, then your upper limit shouldn't be 10. Something like 5-15 min. Sorry if this seems pedantic but I feel your estimate is misleading.
Second point: The data seems to change quite quickly. Would it be possible to do an average over a longer time scale to get a more consistent estimate?

Bad news in the media causes everyone to pull their buy orders above $1 / bitcoin. Me and 10 of my friends (who orchestrated the false bad news) send $12 million to the exchanges and buy up $12 million worth of bitcoin for less than $2 a piece. No one else has bought or sold any bitcoin, so technically, exactly $12 million worth has been "injected into the market". We then announce that the news was false (anonymously of course), and the price rebounds to $6500 simply through people adjusting their buy and sell orders.
It's an extreme example but it illustrates the point. The price is not directly related to "money inserted into the system". A far larger influence is people's expectation of the price and how that affects the order books.

The difference is your two $10 bills do not constitute an IOU. They are already money - there is no need to transfer them back to get your original $20 back. If in your scenario you replace the phrase "two $10 bills" with "A written note saying &lt;fiat_sux4 owes dskloet $20&gt;" then we have a fundamentally different situation, because in your scenario you couldn't give a shit if I lost my $20 in a fire because you already have your **money**, namely those two $10 bills, whereas in the written note-IOU scenario all of a sudden you are worried that you may not get your **money** back, because all you currently have is a note saying I owe it to you, and you just learned that my means of repayment have been compromised (I no longer have the $20 myself).

The idea being that there is now a legitimate concern whether you will ever get your **money** back. (Implying  of course that the IOU that you actual hold in place of that money, is not actually **money**).
You keep going back to semantics, what banks define money as. I don't really care about that, because I believe my argument proves that their definition is not very useful in this context. Anyway, if that's all you have to go on, then I guess we should agree to disagree because I think arguing about semantics is pointless.
Edit: "banks to semantics" -&gt; "back to semantics".

On average it would be. To be exact, the new difficulty curve would be exactly the green curve in this chart:
So basically this change would just change the current difficulty curve (the red one) into the smoother green curve. Notice that every time the current difficulty is adjusted, the green curve coincides with the actual difficulty (as currently defined).

You're not actually "messing with the difficulty". This would be a really minor change. *On average*, the difficulty would be **exactly the same** - it would just be a smoother function. Why do you think that would be a bad thing, or that Bitcoin should be trusted less after such a change? On the surface it seems it would just make Bitcoin better.

There may have been a really low risk, but by some fluke the money was still lost (I am considering loss in a fire to be a fluke).


Yes there is a difference. At the practical level, the difference is small, but it's still there. My bank deposits are not actually money because there are fees associated with retrieving them, and the govt. may just decide to come and steal some of them (see Cyprus), etc. etc. Or if everyone decides to withdraw at the same time, the money all of a sudden doesn't exist anymore.


I see what you're getting at. It increases spending for sure. It probably contributes to price inflation *but not*, in my opinion, *monetary inflation*. I wouldn't call it "bringing money into circulation", because it's not money.


Well, I would disagree.


What constitutes money changes over time, of course. I guess I'd say something is money currently if it's an official currency of some nation. Something like bitcoin is getting there, but not quite there yet, because the man on the street doesn't recognize it as money. In certain contexts, say if you restrict yourself to a Bitcoin conference or Bitcoin street in Berlin, then maybe yeah it's money. Bank deposits are not money - they certainly are not fungible (I cannot use your bank deposit, only you can).
Overall I don't think we disagree on the economics, just on the definitions. I'm saying bank deposits/IOUs are not money because they are *not literally money*. At the microeconomic level, they are practically similar to money, but if you ask how much money exists in the world, I personally would not count them. I was under the impression that the original discussion (by OP, not you or me) was about whether banks, by making loans with money they don't have, are creating money with the implication being that if they are, then whatever money they create adds to monetary inflation thus decreasing the value of the existing money. And I would contend that this is not the case. They may add to price inflation however, but if the amount of fractional reserve that banks are allowed to do is kept at a certain level, then the effect of this practice on price inflation can be controlled, as far as I understand it.

Oh man. How did I not notice that? Anyway, the point stands.


I don't buy that for a second. If I give my friend $1000 and then he loses it in a fire (let's say with no insurance), the IOU still exists but the money doesn't. They are different things.


Agreed, but if that's the only determining factor in an otherwise semantic issue then it's relevant.


Agreed, but it doesn't mean the money exists. They will see this if they ever try to withdraw all at the same time. All of a sudden they will understand how fleeting the idea of "ownership" can be. In other words, you changed the topic from money creation/existence to money ownership.

Thought experiment:
* There's one falsePocketcoin (FPC) in the world.

* Person 2 bought 1 FPC at $1, sells it to Person 3 at $2, makes $1 in profit.
* Person 3 bought 1 FPC at $2, sells it to Person 4 at $3, makes $1 in profit.
* ...
* Person N bought 1 FPC at $(N-1), sells it to Person N+1 at $N, makes $1 in profit.
All Persons make $1 in profit. This is possible as long as the price keeps going up. In fact, the price doesn't even have to keep going forever for everyone to make a profit. It's just that your profit will be smaller if the rate at which the price is going up is a bit slower.

If this is real, and that's a big if (blockchain.info notoriously unreliable with these things, also they are guessing based on frequency of mined blocks and that correlates positively with hash rate but it's not the same thing), it seems strange that the hashrate would jump right after a difficulty increase.

No. There are not three different guys at the bank. There is only the bitcoin trader and the scammer. If a third guy shows up you tell him to fuck off. I already said that. So the guy depositing the money has to be the scammer, because otherwise the scammer doesn't get the bitcoin. So the guy depositing the money is the scammer. That means your statement


is wrong. And no, I already told you,

Edit: one issue is that it's only a temporary fix, as it reduces the bandwidth requirement by a constant factor, so it would mean we could increase the blocksize by that same factor to compensate, but at that point we'd still be stuck. Nevertheless, as a temporary fix it seems like a good one.

I agree it's idiotic, but I think I know where it comes from. I believe they mean to use "Blockchain" as the name of the discipline/technology. So for the same reason we don't put an article in front of Science, Computing, Cryptography, Cryptocurrency, Banking, Fintech, P2P, etc., they have simply shortened "Blockchain Technology", to just "Blockchain".
@_date: 2015-10-16 01:18:20
Interesting idea but you have it backwards. When you make the miner travel at close to the speed of light, time slows down for it which means not as much time passes in its reference frame as it does in ours. In other words, if you have a mining problem that takes ten minutes (finding the next bitcoin block), you send those miners (actually you need all of them if you plan to only spend ten minutes from the spaceship's perspective) on the spaceship travelling close to the speed of light and it will only spend ten minutes from its perspective, but 100 years from our perspective. So it arrives back on Earth 100 years later with the next block, which is of course not what you intended.

03/09/2015 02:33:07	$50.00CAD	0.47010100XBT	$23.50CAD
03/09/2015 02:33:07	$337.78CAD	0.47010100XBT	$158.79CAD
03/09/2015 02:32:56	$343.75CAD	2.89427000XBT	$994.90CAD
There are only two orders at that time 02:33:07 (GMT, I guess), both with the exact same amount of BTC exchanged, namely 0.470101. The order book was not cleared. I'd say it's definitely a glitch.

Right, but then you (the original owner of the bitcoin) would obviously refuse that kind of a deal because you can see there's two people there, and that's the sign that it's a scam.

I think it's better to roll one at a time. You can change up which die it is (in case some of them are unbalanced or whatever). But if you roll a bunch all together, you may unconsciously decide the order in which you read them based on their values, which would reduce the randomness. As an extreme example, if there are letters which form a word, you might read the dice in the order in which the word is formed, rather than in some other order in which no word is formed. Yes, I am being ultra paranoid.

Well before that we will have forked so that difficulty adjusts after every block, not after every 2 weeks. Furthermore, the new difficulty value will be determined based on the last roughly 2 weeks of blocks, not the last 2016 blocks as it currently is.  The users (merchants, full nodes, etc.) never agree to be blackmailed like this, so don't adopt the new fork. The estimated inter-block duration would under your scenario take roughly 1 week to get back to being 20 min long, except that all the older retired miners get turned back on immediately when they see their revenue take a 5x jump almost overnight, so it really only takes 2 or 3 days to get back to a reasonable difficulty. Of course, this is only what would happen if the mining cabal actually followed through with their plans. What they actually do, however, is cheat on each other because they know their plan is doomed to failure, and about half of them actually don't adopt the new fork, and so the actual problem is only half as bad, and the network is only really slow for about a day.
Meanwhile all the evil miners went bankrupt. Crisis averted.

Let's say there are two currencies left after all is said and done. Inflatecoin and bitcoin. By this time, bitcoin is basically *the standard* currency. Only problem is it's "deflationary", i.e. it gets more valuable over time as the economy grows. Simple solution: Inflatecoin is pegged to the bitcoin, except that it is artifically inflated with respect to bitcoin at 3% per year. There, you can have your inflationary currency. It has all the properties that bitcoin has. The only difference is, it loses value against bitcoin at 3% per year. Guess which of the two currencies people are going to use for their long term storage. And now think about what that means for their respective viability.

@_date: 2015-02-01 20:31:28
Check your post history, check my post history. Nope, it's you that's the beginner. Also, the fact that you're not making any sense.
Here, I'll spell it out for you: If the rate that bitcoins are being produced were half of what it actually is, then the price would be double, to make the market cap exactly the same, because the market cap reflects people's expectations of Bitcoin's present and future value. in other words, it's absolutely meaningless to say the production rate is too high.
Here's an analogy. I claim that the number of reddit karma is too high. Instead of getting one karma point per upvote, we should only get 1/10th of a karma point per upvote. See? It doesn't make any sense, because karma points have no meaning outside of reddit, so their value is defined by how many you get per upvote, and you can't say that their value is too low or too high. It's just an arbitrary definition.
Edit: here's another analogy: I claim that the game monopoly is no fun because I only get $200 in fake monopoly money for passing go, and I think I deserve more like $2000 in fake monopoly money every time I pass go, and all the other prices, penalties, cost, rewards and revenues in the game should be multiplied by ten as well. That would make the game more fun for me. But in actual fact, it would make the game exactly the same, because monopoly money is a meaningless made up thing, so multiplying the actual numbers by 10 would actually has no effect on how the game is played. I mean, the British version of monopoly works with fake British monopoly pounds, but the American one works with fake American monopoly dollars, but the actual numbers are exactly the same. How do you explain that????

No. If your computer has been on the internet and may be compromised, then whatever open source option you subsequently use on that computer may be compromised, in theory. Even if you can read and understand the source (and that's a big if), it may be lying to you. The compiler that compiles it could be compromised. Yes, these are theoretical worries, but that's what OP was questioning. Not to mention that most users would just use that open source software, without verifying it by reading and understanding it.

During hyperinflation, the outstanding supply of the inflating currency can double in a really short time frame: days, weeks, months. As of the first halving in Nov 2012, the doubling time for Bitcoin's supply reached infinity. Not only will Bitcoin's supply never double again, there will never be more than 33% more Bitcoin than there are now. We are now at 75% of the final Bitcoin supply. As far as we know we are at 0% of the final supply for every fiat currency. Big difference.

I bought the die. The part I'm worried about is doing the calculation to make the public and private keys from the raw data. It's not easy doing that without a computer I don't think.

(1) Agreed, still inflationary.
(2) Also true, although these days increasing hash rate/difficulty is typically less than 5%, and 9.5% is a 5% discrepancy from 10%.
You may have just remembered the 10% + number from when it was true (not too long ago).
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:42:55
I see your point, and agree that you could be right, but it's going to be a very small difference, not enough to invalidate the argument.

The amount of land that's not covered in ice is pretty small. There's also land under all those lakes in Canada you know :) So really, the only difference is that in Antarctica that water is usually frozen, whereas in Canada it is only frozen for half of the year.

If everyone does this, it can be annoying, but overall I think it leads to a more liquid exchange, which is good. Alternatively, exchanges could implement minimal fees for cancelling orders, but I don't think that's necessary.

It's not that it's more important. It's just confusing and misleading.

If you generate your address (and corresponding private key) on this computer, you have to consider the possibility however remote, that the software that generates them has been compromised, and either the address &amp; private key will be invalid, or someone else will know about it.

Actually these are all way more complicated with fiat currency. People trust fiat over crypto for two reasons:
1. Fiat has a longer history.
2. Governments claim to back fiat (although in practice when push comes to shove sometimes they don't, See: Cyprus 2013, and by printing more money they are implicitly violating that backing).
The idea that fiat is easier to understand is simply not true.

Just saying, when I was trading, I would always try to get my order to be first in line. Usually wouldn't put it just one cent higher though (unless the other guy was doing it to me first and last I got pissed), more like round up to the next dollar. Of course, I was on a low liquidity exchange, so it was a bit easier to do manually.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:06:18
Buy the first half off-market, then put up a buy wall at your desired price on-market. You won't have any slippage, you may not get all your desired coins, but only if the price skyrockets, at  which point you can then sell and profit. It's a win-win.
(I have no expertise in this type of thing.)

Get your facts straight. Only the "Land mass garbage" bitocins can be considered disappeared bitcoins (even wih these, there is no guarantee that they won't be found someday). The others were stolen, or if you like, legally confiscated. They still exist. As for the bitcoins that are lost, it's a small percentage, and rather than making the remaining ones go down in value, it makes them go up, due to supply and demand.

Note, that's the total amount of inflation, not the annual rate. I'm sure what was meant was that no more inflation has materialized than was expected (within reasonable bounds), which seems entirely plausible.

You realize that the avg. Bitcoin transaction value depends on the avg. fee right? So when the fees go up, the avg. value will go up too because the lower value transactions are being priced out of the market. Yes, you said that, of course you realize it. Then how do you expect the fees will ever hit resistance from avg. transaction value users if the avg. transaction keeps getting more expensive due to lower value transactions being priced out? By definition it won't. The fees are only in conflict with low value transactions, not avg. value transactions.
