It's been almost a month since your last post!!
I'm actually kind of getting worried lol...

@_date: 2017-12-28 18:46:14
Back then even alot of hodlers were skeptical of bitcoin's longevity. I don't think it will be the same this time. The bear market will be short lived if any.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:21:22
The best way forward here is get the government out of the way. Bitcoin in and of itself is already anti government. Do not count on the gov even if they may say they want to help. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:32:00
Do not trust anyone from these liberal/socialist Ivy-League universities bought and paid for by liberal media/gov.

Your right sir. Just because someone has lots of bitcoin, doesn't mean they would always be for "bitcoin".
just like how some US citizens in this country do not wanna see US to succeed. You judge them by their action not by what they say.  
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:25:26
very good point sir. :D

Bye Bye BU!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:29:41
Don't worry man. Come to think of it. This is actually good for bitcoin in the long run. It will become more mature and resilient through thick and thin. I don't believe in any stocks, bonds or printed fiat currency. Only trust bitcoin and gold/silver as a store of value.     
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:52:50
another Amen!!
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:59:15
Nope, bitcoin will always be bitcoin. You are seeing surge in euthreum and dash only because those who oppose bitcoin has failed to affect bitcoin with SEC rejection. They are buying up altcoins just to divert people's attention. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:09:22
I do have a feeling some are trying to sabotage bitcoin after learning that SEC rejection has failed to bring down bitcoin. They don't want these shitty altcoins. They just dont want bitcoin to succeed. I almost guarantee you all these altcoins will fall back to their usual baseline pretty soon. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:54:32
So ridiculous...
We are to trust and protect the privacy of Government, banks and they can keep us out of their loop whatever transactions they do, deals they make, and derivatives they sign up to steal from their customers. 
In the meanwhile, they must see all the transactions we make, what we buy and sell in every possible footstep. 
This is totally one way scam. if they want to sensor us, we should sensor them as well. Would they agree? hell no. :D 
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:06:51
I will certainly miss those days of dreading nonsense BU hardfork argument. Bye Bye BU....

that's alot! 
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:24:34
Just to be clear, 
what about those shift card transactions? Does this mean they are going to make us pay the miner's fees for each transaction from now?
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:08:13
Don't bother. He is indeed a BU supporter. He's just pretending he's not yet is trying to convince others they should for hard-fork. There are so many here doing just that since SEC has failed to destroy bitcoin.
Typical BU-llshit. :D   
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:12:49
Thanks a bunch!! finally running full nodes completely :D
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:09:13
I actually want ether to keep going up to the point where they just collapse all at once because of that one person who's pumping it right now will dump it like there's no tmr.

Most miners are in China. 
Would you really wanna ask them why they don't want it?
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:00:38
My theory is simple as this. Most miners are in China. That means ultimately Chinese government controls mining and they indirectly orders them(Jihan Wu) to do whatever they can to undermine the success of bitcoin. In the meanwhile, they see that Segwit will lead to the ultimate solution of the bitcoin scalability, which again isn't in their best interest.

@_date: 2017-03-16 04:14:07
on the order books, 
there are numerous orders to buy in many different amounts. Whenever it trends up, there's always one single order to sell with large amount of bitcoins to suppress the price back to 1250. Is it just me or do you guys agree with my observation? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:28:03
Nope. we are good where we are. Hopefully we will initiate UASF soon.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:51:07

@_date: 2017-03-11 01:19:24

We need to actively participate in bitcoin by running the full node for the core in support of segwit. 
Let's make sure that we keep the integrity and principle of bitcoin intact for the time being.

As core devs say it's not that urgent. For sure, UASF's not as horrendous as BU, but it will still cause disruption among the miners and is not something we need urgently. Let's just wait till the core dev comes up with something more stable. it can wait. Dont rush it.

If those companies can't handle the fees then so be it. Bitcoin doesn't have to do anything and it will still be around just like it has been. Let people come to bitcoin for what it is today and tmr and in the future. We will still be around whether you like it or not.

tbh, I'm getting a bit anxious about what's happening tmr. Altho my mind is already set on HODLing till the death of me Largely in thanks to your wake-up posts in the earlier days. 
u know what? Nothing matters to me more than freedom anyway.
LET'S DO THIS! IT'S BITCOIN OR BUST!!!

Bitderberg don't care whether you are a paid troll or a volunteer for your troll association.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:09:51
Do you want to get rich steadily but surely? then Bitcoin.

That was sick!! He's got some balls of steel:D
@_date: 2017-07-03 07:52:55
He's not wasting his time. He's helping the community (especially the Big Noooobs) learn to figure out who's really telling the truth. Everyone wants to be a hero and save the world but not if their reputation is at stake.

I second this. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:16:34
There is no fucking place for banks in Bitcoin. Period!

Can't believe all these people who had bought into the ideas&amp;fundamentals of bitcoin somehow think that Government is entitled to their bitcoin holdings...

Bitderberg can smell a fraud from a mile away. :D
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:24:24
HAHA... yeah there's really no way to identify the Bitcoin address owner.

yep, just look up his past history and see how consistently he has been calling out these trolls and shills with FACTS. I don't think he will ever get the credit he deserves from people here but unfortunately that's how the system works in this corrupt environment. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:55:39
HAHA. he seems pretty darn mad for missing that train.  
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:57:21
Bitcoin is not a gamble. Fiat is. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:01:14
Learn harder. Stop shitposting.

One suggestion: 
There are so many North Koreans starving to death right now. 
You can volunteer to help them grow crops or something. :D
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:32:00
BYE BYE!!!

Constitutional conservatives like Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul are examples of my long term support. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:58:59
Just listen to Bitderberg. You won't regret it for life. :D
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:31:01
Jesus... Awesome work bitderberg. They don't really seem to mind going so far out to spread their lies and FUD. Your insight is always appreciated. I've learned alot. :D

Didn't "BilderbergGroup" create the Euro?????? :D
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:04:53
Awesome! Any "contentious" softfork with the possibility of "split chains" must not be considered by any measure.  Please just leave our honey badger alone. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:23:39
just got some HODLCORN TOO! :D

If you are really honest, you shouldn't have any problems with his attitude.
