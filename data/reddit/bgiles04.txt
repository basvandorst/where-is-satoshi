Wow...Not saying it's over, but that $8700 test price that almost EVERY analyst stated was a solid estimate for a bottom just hit and rebounded back over 9k in less than 15 minutes. 
It could still tank again but seems like that price by so many analysts triggered the bulls threshold for auto buy.

1 month in crypto is 6 months in typical investing.

Don't be sorry...you are 1/2 correct. It takes several days because of the banking system. The additional time is Coinbase taking advantage of the market they create. They have your committed buy at a certain price. If the price goes up it is profitable for them. If there is any dip in the additional 3-5 days it takes to deposit your coins then extra profit.

Because after being on a rocket to the moon over this past year the thought of going back to "the grind" of investing in stocks with "big" 5-10% gains daily/weekly gains puts me to sleep. Crypto as it was before is dead because I can no longer day trade due to the tax implications here in the U.S. So I'm waiting on a serious recovery to sell off 60-80% of my speculative shitcoins. Then I'll keep 20-40% until it moons or goes into the abyss whichever comes first.
