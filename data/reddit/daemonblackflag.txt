you’re a troll that wants to get rich quick and you surround yourself with other folks of similar nature. roger ver is only liked by you due to his millions of dollars he accumulated and invested back into bitcoin which he’s trying to destroy for the purpose of financial gain. he treats bitcoin cash as a company not a world changing technology.
i personally believe that bitcoin, not bcash, will implement a more decentralized way of scaling than simply bigger blocks.
and when it does - bcash will be truly irrelevant. youll cry - and ill be fine because i’m in fiat right now while the idiots fight back and forth over which currency is better.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:32
r/btc is owned by roger ver who is for whatever reason attempting to take over bitcoin by claiming bitcoin is under attack by blockstream and that the current version of bitcoin doesn’t follow satoshi nakamotos white paper, even though if you ask me the current version of bitcoin is doing just fine according to the white paper.
bcash is trash pump and dump alt coin. most alts are pointless. roger ver is most likely a sociopath who has a lot of money. money isn’t everything - it will make your life easier and more enjoyable but it’s just money. it doesn’t mean you are better than someone else. roger is one of those people who feels he is better than someone else due to his current monetary holdings. 
lol, i like watching videos of him, he’s definitely not someone i’d befriend if i saw him on the street. strip the man down to nothing, and he’s annoying as fuck. 
long story short, fuck roger. the only people who like roger have made money on his behalf. seriously, look at the company he keeps - his only friends have one thing in common, money. 
the only reason people pay attention to him is because he invested in bitcoin and has a lot of bitcoin. and now he’s trying to claim bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin. 
roger is harmful to bitcoin, wolf in sheeps clothing. years ago people praised him. lol.
end rant.

you “don’t even have a dog in this fight” but you still go around attacking bitcoin? guessing one of your jobs is being paid by roger. lol.

lol you’re such a savior.
no i don’t care about that i’m a wealthy entrepreneur. bitcoin only helps me offset the down times of that roller coaster ride.
i like bitcoin because i can send money to someone without having to give them a way to steal money from me (credit cards). 
i also like being able to move a huge amount of money for a few bucks or less (depending on the flooded mempool.)
you do realize i feel roger ver and bcash is the MLM bs right? i tell all of my newbie friends not to touch things like BitConnect and random other obvious scams, but they don’t listen and they make money - haha.
i’m in fiat right now after that coinbase BS. but you’re confusing me with a bcash lover. lol. 
i got into bitcoin back in 2012, owned a KnC Miner, owner litecoin mining rigs, ethereum mining rigs, etc. i do this stuff as a hobby. find someone else to attack. lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:10:27
negative. i see how bitcoin can literally change the world. it’s about being able to do things you couldn’t normally do prior to it’s existence. the price rise is a side effect of this which helps reshape the landscape during the process.
bcash is far more centralized and that goes against everything that bitcoin is supposed to be.
i would have ZERO ISSUES with bcash if they stopped trying to ride on the coattails of bitcoins brand. roger is purposely confusing people for his own financial gain.
and then of course people ride on rogers coattails and try to profit because that’s all some people care about.
humans are shitty.

The current generation of miners (people who pre-ordered KnC) have profited since 2013. This means that in 2014 all coins mined are pure profit no matter what they sell at, and a good share of these people are not necessarily holding.
Another thing to keep in mind, the majority of people selling are most likely traders - they don't care what the price is, they care about making money on the ups and downs. (And since the trader sold, they will eventually buy back in, and then sell, and buy, etc... there will ALWAYS be people selling - ALWAYS, even when bitcoin hits new heights, people will sell, it will crash, etc. People will then buy in, sell, buy in, sell.. Why are you surprised people are trading? I don't understand why people think it's stupid to buy or sell... there's trading 24/7, there's ALWAYS TRADING, the trading never stops, no matter what the price. Rant, rant, rant.
I'm still holding in cold storage, I'm not going to bother with trading until I see ~3000/coin - which will happen before the end of 2014. I'm a speculator of course. :)

Posting a chat log that dates back to March 29, 2013 - between myself and my business partner.
MARCH 29, 2013:
i keep monitoring bitcoin value
1 year ago it was worth $16.6244 per BTC
2 days ago $87.6967
7 days ago $76.2467
30 days ago $54.9333
6m ago $27.0048
APRIL 03, 2013:
also, im regretting not buying some bitcoins @ ~$90 USD... right this moment it's at $130 USD and hit $146 i believe, i was actually waiting for the price to go down to $60 USD, but for some reason they shot up again, so strange, but at least the small amount of bitcoins i have - they were worth $17, now are $25, haha
APRIL 04, 2013:
btw, im very tempted to put a lot of money into Bitcoins, i am just afraid of the risks... but some people believe it will multiple 1000 fold again, others say it will have a few market bubbles occur before 2015
some guy has written an article about bitcoin hyperdeflation, but it’s complete BS if you ask me
says that no one will spend bitcoin because its value keeps going up
thats like saying no one will buy a computer because in 6 months something better will be available to buy
APRIL 08, 2013:
as i predicted, bitcoin keeps going up, $189.1 now
i put an order in @ $145 but if they fill it later at the current market price im getting it at whatever it will be (coinbase)
APRIL 09, 2013:
its already over 200
i have a feeling
this will go to $1000+
there will be times it drops $100
goes up $200
but i have a feeling it will remain consistent at a high rate
(btw, bitcoin = 218.4) lol
Bought @ $260 (right about to crash)
APRIL 10, 2013:
Bought more @ 130$ (balanced out the 260$)
Holding coins since then, couldn't be happier. BTW this isn't 100% accurate, i was copying/pasting from an old skype chat log between myself and my business partner. Good times.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:52:07
Exactly. No one with a real business would touch this logo with a 10ft pole. Most businesses accept credit cards still too, so they are risking losing all credit card acceptance by using this logo.
This should not be a "real logo", this should be posted in or something, this should just be a gentle laugh for a few moments - and gone.
Also fuck litecoin. Yeah, I said it.
(I do not care for alt coins that do not bring anything new to the table. Altcoins are not faster, they just take more confirmations to truly be confirmed. They are not unASICable, they just take longer for people to care about creating ASICs for.)

I pre-ordered a KnC Jupiter back in the day.
Sold it on eBay after a few months of mining to maximize profit.
I thought about pre-ordering neptune or titan so many times, and never pulled the trigger.
My worst decision ever was paying for the miner in BTC, which was around 50 at the time - I regret this. I should have paid in USD and kept my BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:37:30
He has a point though. Who didn't know that the NSA was spying? I've been telling people for years that every single skype call you get into, every single e-mail you send, every single chat message you read and respond with... it's all seen by the government. Unless you have some form of end to end encryption, it's public to hackers and of course the NSA.
For example, the video game Splinter Cell - did people think that was 100% sci-fi futuristic fantasy bs? It was a game about the NSA being able to tap into networks and such. I think the game even said little tips during loading screens like "The NSA on average intercepts 4 billion transmissions per day." or something similar. And again, people thought this was BS?
I take everything with a grain of salt. I don't have a dog in the snowden hero/traitor debate. In all honesty I think this is just another way to divide and conquer the american people. It's no different than Republicans vs Democrats.

@_date: 2014-03-30 23:55:51
The people who are mining right now are still making a slight profit. I'm mainly talking about KnCMiner people - as that is the majority of the hashrate, and KnCMiner people have had their hardware since August-November of 2013, which I know from experience (I received my hardware in October), they all have profited long ago. Heck, I even sold my miner for 12k USD after I was done with it - and reinvested most of that back into BTC.
They have profited long ago, and any extra coin (even if it's worth $100) is worth profit to them to sell, which helps the price go down.
As soon as the next generation of KnC arrives, the Neptunes, those miners are 100% NOT PROFITABLE at the current going rate of $463.86 (BTC-e), and won't even be profitable at $1,200. I personally feel the price of bitcoin will have to go to $2,XXX.XX for the KnC miner owners to be content. There is no way in hell on average they are going to sit there selling their bitcoin for USD at a loss.
There are many other factors that go into this, but the trend that I have seen is as follows...
1) Miners spend money on hardware
2) Miners mine for 1-2 months
3) Miners break even
4) Miners sell at any price because they already broke even.
~~~TREND RESET~~~
5) New hardware comes out - miners buy new hardware
6) Miners mine for 1-2 months
7) Miners break even
8) Miners sell at any price because they already broke even.
And of course this means that the price of bitcoin has to go up so they break even, and then goes down slowly as everyone is profiting and can afford to sell at any rate.
You could argue that the miners don't make enough bitcoin to actually justify this being a proper theory. But a lot of these miners have been mining since 2011, and have been reinvesting money, as the average person does not want to risk $10,000 on a new miner - but a person who made $50,000+ from GPU mining is perfectly fine understanding how this concept works.
At this point I'm just rambling, but I truly believe that before the end of August 2014 we will see $2,000+ again, and it most definitely might be sooner.

I got burned by PayPal as a merchant in the past. I was accepting it for one of my virtual currency businesses. I was getting a lot of fraudulent transactions from China out of nowhere. They didn't even warn me and give me time to implement better anti-fraud measures, they simply froze my account and asked me to keep ~$100k in my account at all times, because I was so "risky".
I said no, I cannot afford to do this and operate on my current margins - and they shut me down entirely. I had to wait 180 days for them to release the remaining funds on my account (they claimed there might be more chargebacks and that's why they needed to wait 180 days just to be sure - even though there were NO more chargebacks, not a single one).
I was also told I cannot use PayPal for business ever again. Apparently they don't trust me to create a new business? That sort of mentality just roadblocked me from using their service. I was forced to get creative and use places like Second Life and the iPhone Developer Program to earn income - and guess what? I made businesses even MORE successful than the ones I used with PayPal. And then I took a good chunk of that and threw it into Bitcoin just over a year ago.
Anyway - this is why I love bitcoin. If Bitcoin was as popular as PayPal a few years ago, my business wouldn't have had to shut down and I'd still be making 6 figures a year from that business. (Granted, I might have gotten lazy and not wanted to keep reinventing myself, branching out, etc.)
I do see why you want to keep using PayPal though, if you don't you're turning down a lot of funding. I just hope that you don't have to rely on PayPal. I too would love to use PayPal for business reasons again, but their reliability for me is next to none.

There is no "default", if multiple apps use the same custom uri scheme, iOS will pop up a notification letting you select which app to open... There is no way to "register a unique custom uri scheme", literally every single app in the app store could use bitcoin:// - it's just not advised.
Apps can also use multiple custom uri schemes, for example it would be wise for bitstore to use bitstore:// as well as bitcoin:// for their app's functionality.
Most people will not have 10 different wallets, unless of course they are scared the wallets will disappear from the app store, so most people will only have bitcoin:// on ONE app. If you aren't using 10 wallets, why keep them around? Back them up on your computer's iTunes or something, i think that's possible.
Hope this was informative.
Edit: just a heads up, I have a few wallet apps - but apparently only Blockchain is using bitcoin:// as a custom uri scheme... strange? It opens Blockchain every time (which I'm glad, as that's the one I want to be using on iOS.)

I guess what I'm saying is... it's trial and error until the QR Code Reader picks it up... one would only have to try flipping around until the code is read.
NOW, if you came up with a method that is READABLE by QR Code Readers from even more than 1 alignment - I would give this credibility. Someone would scan it, see that they got a private key, and steal funds from it, possibly not even bothering with continuing to see if other possibilities exist, satisfied with ~$20 of free bitcoin, the rest hidden away in another configuration - most likely an encrypted configuration... but if you make every other possibility somehow show a fake qr code, the likeliness of them even finding your real one is slim, as they'd be likely to give up right away.
Also, is it not easy to realize what side the "printing" is on, which makes this much easier to realize that you should not be bothering with the unprinted side?
Again, just making commentary, the idea is neat none-the-less, just not something I personally want to bother with, I'm happy with my encrypted private key wallet stored at multiple locations.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:11:55
I can see your view. It's a QR Code App for iOS devices. One might think it belongs under an iOS Apps Sub-Reddit, or maybe a QR Code Sub-Reddit, etc.
It is also an app I made solely for the use of scanning Bitcoin QR Codes.
EDIT: I move funds between paper and digital wallets every so often, and optimized it to work efficiently for my own bitcoin QR usage, now I want to see if anyone else has feedback that makes it more efficient for them.

The part about "but only one in eight ways of superposing reveals the code"...
It doesn't take much research to realize that QR Codes require the 3 "position" squares at the top left, top right and bottom left. 
Basically - it's easy as hell to figure out how it should be aligned, and once you start to "form the QR Code" you'll realize you have it right. You're basically hoping that people know nothing about QR Codes which are plastered everywhere now-a-days.

The Apple App Store just approved the app. You probably can't search for it yet, but you can visit qrscans.org from your mobile device and tap "Download Now" to get it. (It links to the app store listing)
I made this app because people got me worried about "what do QR Code Apps do with the images after you've scanned?", so I made sure to make the most simple, lightweight, banner-free app I could come up with - and also make it free. It doesn't cost me anything to keep this app around since it doesn't do any networking. And since it doesn't do any networking, there's less risk of a vulnerability in the app.
The only "Catch" is the fact I request Push Notifications to be on, so I can notify users of QR Scans of new, banner-free apps I make in the future. :)
EDIT: I would like to know to add to the app. When it detects a Bitcoin Public Address - should it do anything special? (Open Blockchain.info in Mobile Safari?)
My whole idea was to keep this lightweight and not touching networking, so I'd want to stay away from dealing with direct APIs to show anything in the app.
Feedback welcomed.

I ordered 1oz gold liberty coin on January 20th of this year. It was shipped out on February 05th of this year. I received it a few days after that. That being said, don't give up hope if you've already placed an order with Coinabul, keep trying over and over again to obtain it. Don't give up. To all future purchasers, use AMAGIMETALS.com - i just placed an order yesterday for a silver 2oz coin (it's basically an illuminati debt and death coin, i thought it looked awesome) and they shipped it today already. I paid in BTC of course.
I don't know why this guy says AMAGIMETALS stopped accepting bitcoin, that's simply not true. I just paid today. As soon as Bitcoin is out of this $4XX range and back toward $7XX I will probably buy a 1oz gold coin from AMAGIMETALS, but not again from Coinabul.
No offense to Coinabul, but they are slow - they DID deliver though. I ordered before the GOX Crash - and they WERE publicly touting around they were gox approved... awkwarrrrrrd.

Just bought a $50 steam wallet code.
Took about 15-20 minutes to get the code to my e-mail, and that was that.
All I had to do was give them my e-mail address (so they can send the code) and tell them my first name (so they can address me properly, but the default name was "Anonymous", so it's not like you needed to give personal details.
Great experience. It seems they pre-stock the codes in some sort of database so it's automated. If they are out of stock of codes they will tell you. It said "20 codes in stock" when I ordered, now it says "19" the moment I checked after I received my code.

They want you to think it's $10,000. They also want you to think it's $9,500 ... $8,500 ... etc.
They want you to think it's something much higher than it really is, so when you try to be "sneaky" and transact "a lower amount" - you are actually still being tracked.
Since a few people are talking "$3,000" - i bet it's anything over $2,000 and as I'm typing this they are probably saying "shit, we need to lower it again" to $1,750 ... and of course now it's $1,500 because of that, now $1,000 ... $500... $250... ah fuck, I think every $1 is now being traced - start doing transactions in cents - fffff-i should really keep my mouth shut.

I was in the red with bitcoin only for a few months after i bought in at ~$226/ea. I'm currently looking at a 276% ROI.
The only thing I regret is buying a miner with my coins when the price was ~$100/ea. If I had just held my coins I would have kept my true buy-in at ~$120 and be at a 521% ROI.
No matter what I'm still happy, can't wait until I see bitcoin back in the 4 figures. I estimate by the end of july if not june we'll see such a thing. Granted, it will definitely crash back down many more times on its way up, but I've never been one to care about day trading. I'm in this for the long haul.
My Personal Lesson: Don't Mine and Hold Coins!
(I keep a small amount of bitcoin hot at all times, just enough to buy things here and there, usually precious metals.)

Friend told me about this while they were playing the game, I didn't believe them so I had them send me a screenshot from their device.

You'd not have to bother with passing a credit card/cash back and forth, waiting for a receipt, etc. Just push a button and it's done, receipt on your mobile.

I like that he seems to be pro-bitcoin, but I wouldn't touch him with a 10-foot-pole.
Granted, I wouldn't touch Hillary with a 200-foot-pole, but that doesn't mean anything! Leave me alone!
If Rand allows a lot of Ron's ideals to shine through, I guess I'd touch him with a 1-foot-pole, but that's as close as I'm getting to agreeing with this "democratic system".
Good day.

Use google and research his pros and cons, I'm not here to debate politically, I just dislike our "US Democracy", which I feel is completely rigged from the get go, and whoever wins is going to bend over and do someone else's bidding no matter what. 
I, by researching, like Rand more than I like Hillary for instance, but I think the system for electing these ridiculously rich people is stupid as hell. We need people who have a balanced intelligence, and are middle class or lower who understand the true problems running the show.

I have ordered from Bit-Card twice now. The first product they sent me was good - but the QR Codes were far too small.
The second time I ordered they upgraded the way they print and they are perfect. I used BIP0038 passphrase of course.
I use these for cold storage all of the time, and I made sure there is not one single point of failure.
I even opted for the little key chain they have, the weusecoins orange one, haha.

Just because you can google "rand paul net worth", or any other person followed by "net worth", does not mean it is true.
I have a feeling the average politician has many more valuable assets than just their public net worth. 
Either way, if you have millions of dollars - you're too rich to be president in my book. Most people don't have millions of dollars, so how can a millionaire represent most people?

I have purchased from Coinabul.com and had VERY SLOW success. They kept me waiting far too long, many weeks.
I have purchased from AmagiMetals.com and had great success. Order showed up within a few days after ordering.
I have SOLD to AgoraCommodities.com and had great success. Paid me BTC within a few days after selling gold.
I more-or-less fully trust Amagi and Agora. I barely trust Coinabul, but they DID pull through, I've just heard so many negative stories about them.

if any one individual can control bitcoin, then it's failed ages ago and we all have just have been ignorant of this very fact.

i used to have the plate BTC in my state. i got rid of it. it screams "i have money" to some people. and you don't want to say that to the wrong person. lol.
i still have the old plates, one hanging on my wall, but i don't dare drive around advertising i have wealth in the form of bitcoin.

regarding opinion - i believe it matters also how much perceived power you have in a community.
Louis C.K. was able to consistently get people to want to watch him beat off.
The average joe cannot get into this situation.
if i ran around screaming “Bitcoin Copper is the real bitcoin” no ones going to do anything differently.

this is a repost i saw somewhere else recently.
most people in here don’t have lambos. op definitely doesn’t which is why they posted someone else’s video.
it’s very difficult not to sell when you see your money increase 10x then crash down so it’s only a 2x total increase, etc. 
i believe that the majority of bitcoin lambo owners bought in ages ago when it was pennies per coin and forgot about it and were reminded about it later on. most likely extra coins from buying something online ages ago.

In my opinion, it's a lot better than IRC chat. I can scale this up/down very inexpensively. IRC requires a lengthy connection sequence and publicly displays your IP to everyone in the channel.
It's setup very similarly - I do admit.

thats not necessarily true, regarding "everyone who held pre-fork and is now holding bch and btc... is fine no matter what happens."
if i want to buy bitcoin right now to add to my equal BTC/BCH holdings, you are saying i should look at the price of BTC and BCH and divide up my $100 buy order between both currencies. 
at the current rate i'd have to spend $25 on BCH and $75 on BTC (based on the $5734 per BTC, and $1917 per BCH rates)
...so are you telling me that's how i'm supposed to buy bitcoin from now on?
...what if everyone sells BCH and puts it into ethereum and litecoin?! I should also buy equal shares of those as well just to be safe.
...what if someone cashes out??? can i invest in USD in case it goes up as well!?!?

I'm trying to find uses for my bitcoin "New gTLD" domains - if enough people stick around i'll keep it up for good. Just testing the waters. :)
Oh, and you CAN put something bogus for e-mail, it's only used for account recovery.

I was and am still a fan of Ron Paul, but Rand Paul does not seem to be anything like Ron at all. They share the same last name, and that's about it.
To those of you who are going to mindlessly donate to him so you can say "I was one of the first people to use Bitcoin to fund a presidential candidate!", I don't like you.
One of the main reasons Ron didn't become president in the first place was because of how he didn't bend over and go through all of the motions. He doesn't bow to Israel, he doesn't want the Federal Reserve, etc. RAND on the other hand made sure to leave out the whole "Audit the Fed" message that Ron preaches upon, and he's been known to follow all of the motions, which makes him look obedient not dominate by any means (AKA, he's not going to be a good leader, he's just a puppet).
1-2 years ago I would mindlessly use Bitcoin every single time a new opportunity showed up. Sometimes I didn't even really care about the product I just thought it was cool I could be a part of something big. But this is where I personally draw the line.
Edit: lol @ downvotes.

$850 could easily be a low we see before it starts to rise again.
i say this because i know a lot of folks got scared of jihans BU-llshit and wanted to preserve wealth as quickly as possible during the downward trend that happened. watching it drop a few hundred dollars is terrifying when the ATH was 1200ish.
so i have a feeling a lot of people are on the sidelines in FIAT wanting to get back in at a lower price point because owning 10 bitcoin is better than 5 bitcoin long term.
