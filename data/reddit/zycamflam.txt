I actually offer this service.  And I do it for a nominal fee. I provide a DIY kit. You simply take a picture of the total amount of Money, a picture of yourself with the money counted out, a picture of Roger Ver, and a feminine vaginal cleaner(called a “douche”) . Then, based off of how much cash you have to burn, I will give you a certain amount of bitcoin. If you accept the trade, you make a video with you burning the money, picture of Roger Ver, and the douche bag you were sent with the kit, while chanting BCASH BCASH BCASH, once this is complete and confirmed by the community here, I will transfer said bitcoin. In fact if you make the wallet address public I’m pretty damn sure you will get some donations by this community for doing all of this.

You should go fork those 10 BTC from the paper wallet and get your free BCASH. Keep your BTC. Sell off said BCASH and get them a new set of Mormon Underwear and tell them you bought them these with your proceeds from BCASH BCASH BCASH. Then take a pic of them smiling and tweet Roger Ver. Lastly, you will get your own planet for being insightful enough to remind Roger Ver what a douche he is.

Wow that was really relevant. Good job.

Are there Hover Boards in 2038?

I wonder why the policy change?
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:36:16
For them to be down for long, then it could be the merchant processors that have instituted a new policy, or even banking regulation change? Not sure, I’m in the states, but my wife and I are moving back to Van in a couple of months. Hopefully it’s something simple like the most popular merchant process is having temporary issues technical wise. We shall see.

Actually totally agree. If you don’t know how to do this you can even get an app called head space that walks you through mindfulness with guided meditation. Their 10 minute free daily exercise really helped me get a more calm mind to make more decisive decisions. But hey, this may be for a different sub. 
Don’t sweat it. Focus on what you can do now, learn from the past. The price right now is irrelevant. Each time you sold you probably thought those were high prices at the time because you were in a way price conditioned. Do the same now. Make your buys. And HODL. It has historically proven thus far to be the way to build your wealth.

Sorry to hear this. I had a briefcase and laptop stolen from my backseat years ago and I was in a rental (and didn’t pay for the extra insurance coverage lol). They broke the back window in the parking lot of a mall in a very safe area. Had to replace the window myself and the laptop. None of which were covered. But thankfully this was before bitcoin days. Since then I never leave anything in the cabin of the car. Always lock things of value in the trunk. Was a good lesson. But I digress. What kind of laptop were you running? Mac? Windows pc? Linux by any chance? There are very low odds but you may have a tiny chance. If the timing is right.

Yup. Definitely localbitcoins.

Well, Do you have anything that runs in the background that either is used to connect to it, like gotomypc or teamviewer or the likes? Or maybe something that connects to gmail, or another google service? These types of online accounts like google based ones log IP addresses and you can typically display location information based in the security sections. If that machine went online for example and connected to the purps wifi, it would show the IP address of the perp and you could use ip location online (just google Ip geolocation) to see around where the perp is, and sometimes depending on where you look, you can get really close. I don't know in windows, but I believe windows 10 has something like Mac does, called find my device, as long as you were logged in to your Microsoft account.

They batch out their transactions in groups and during high volume it can take hours for them to batch your transaction. It did be fine. If they haven't sent it within 8 hours, well, wait longer. Unfortunately, their customer service sucks balls. I'm waiting on a tester as we speak as well from GDAX. I'm sure it will happen.... Good luck.

I sent mine out at 3:43pm PST. Which is almost exactly 2 hours ago and its complete now and confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:18:07
This. Wire the money. If you are in USA and wire before 1pm PST, it will be there by 4pm.

While I can't disagree with your statement, the reality is, we are all speculating. I simply wrote what I would, and have done with those sums of money and then some, and have continued to do since 2012. BTC has always been the best investment I ever made. With the halvings we've seen over the years it just has proven more and more difficult to see a worthwhile ROI in buying a mining rig even if electricity wasn't the main constraint. But hey, we could both be right or wrong in any given moment.

Buy coin baby. You aren’t gonna get a close ROI any time soon.

If this is a wire transfer and not an ACH as mentioned above, then it is absolutely not normal. Whenever I wire to gdax in the past it was always same day as long as I did it before 2 p.m. Pacific time
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:05:02
Good luck. Instead what I suggest is contact metropolitan bank and speak to their wiring department. Tell them you contacted the CFPB and were advised that if they don’t return the wire or apply it immediately that they will open an inquiry themselves. I got my wire back once after 3 weeks of run around, in less that an hour.

I had no problem sending from coinbase to my Nano Ledger S Segwit address. Not a problem at all. And the transaction was fast, with low fees.
