This implies nothing, but it's becoming apparent that you're not a very lucid kind of guy, so I'll give it a pass.

I didn't think it was possible, but you've topped your previous post.

Mate, you are the signal.  Do not let the noise get you down.

God your comment is dense, but OK, I'll wade in briefly and fix it for you.

Nope.  LinuxDA was released in 2001.


Nope.  That shit was going on for over a decade before you became aware of it.


Nope.  You can do that on windows phone and blackberry as well.  And I'm pretty sure firefox OS soon (if not already).


 
I don't have an iphone, I just hate stupid when I see it.

I don't actually own an iphone, but it does a huge disservice to not give credit to apple where it's due, and worse to give credit to google where it doesn't deserve it.  I'm old enough to remember when microsoft was a truly destructive force stalling innovation on the web and desktop, but at the same time want to see a resurgent microsoft.  We kind of need them now.
 
Google owning such a huge portion of the mobile space is dangerous.  They're an advertising company, after all, and the only reason they give anything away for free is so that they can build a better profile of you.  Apple, blackberry, and microsoft, meanwhile, at least let you be the customer, instead of the product.
However, A lot of people are OK with being google's product, and that's fine.  They are free to do that.  Google has done some great stuff, and I freely admit it, but when fanboys engage in selective editing of history, I just find it gross.  
 
I guess in the end, when it comes to swatting fanboys, be they pro-google, pro-apple, whatever... I'm willing to be a jerk about it.

There you go, shitting all over the board.
