That's a good point.  I actually have a Visa debit card.  
I walked into my bank and got it within 20 minutes of filling out the form and making my first deposit.  They gave me one that said VALUED CUSTOMER instead of my name, but I could use it just fine.  The real one, stamped with my name, came in the mail a few days later.
HOWEVER, I did have to furnish a ton of personal info to open the account and get that card.  SSN, proof of address, etc.  And I had to sign stuff in person.
I also opened as Simple bank account online a while back.  There was less friction there, but I still had to provide my SSN.
I guess my surprise comes from the way my Visa debit card is leveraged everywhere else online to prove my financial identity and make instant purchases.  I'm just used to it working that way.
And I wasn't trying to "open an account" as much as "buy bitcoins."  So that was the mindset I had going in.  I'll just use my Visa card and buy some.

You mean a country where I have to pick my baby's name from a government-approved list, like half of Europe?  Or where I have a bloodline monarch, again like half of Europe?
Freedoms vary from place to place, and its easy to take the ones that you're used to for granted.
In the US, the freedoms even vary dramatically from state to state.

Yeah, didn't know what this was, so I was trying to do it in the most "direct" way possible (through an exchange).
So this is essentially the Craigslist of BTC, right?
Turns out there's someone in my tow selling, so that's cool.
Though... meeting someone in person and exchanging cash might make the scary factor of BTC even greater...
I mean as an adoption issue for BTC for the wider public.

For my $100 deposit on CEX.io, the fee was 3.5% plus .39 cents, I think.  The total charge was $103.89.
Then when I bought Bitcoin, CEX split it into two separate transactions:
Bought 0.04000000 BTC at 1188.0597 USD  ($3.33 fee)
Bought 0.03865450 BTC at 1188.2186 USD ($3.22 fee)
So... yikes, over to $10 in fees so far!  That's kinda crazy.  Ten percent.
Then for withdrawal (sending Bitcoin out to my Blockchain wallet), there's a flat 0.00050000 BTC fee.  Only $0.59 at the current exchange rate.  Not bad, I guess.

It wasn't mentioned here, that I saw:
Under "Get Bitcoins," it just tells you about finding an exchange.  That's what I did.  I also did research on this sub, where I found mention of CEX.io.
Even the sidebar of this sub, with all the getting started stuff, doesn't mention Localbitcoins OR ATMs, that I can find.  Maybe it's buried somewhere, but on the surface, it's all about various online exchanges.

Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  There isn't one in my town, though.

How are you going to deal with the potential for fraud and chargebacks?
And what about he KYC AML laws?

Can you unpack that a bit, or link me to the best article about how and why banking regs apply to BTC exchanges?
The "money service business" ID regs, as I understand them, are meant to thwart money laundering.  But once I have BTC in my possession, all tracking goes out the window, right?  So how does it help that they know I bought them in the first place, if they don't know where I'm spending them?
Well, I guess it's the same with cash, currently, in the US.  When you deposit or withdraw a large sum of cash, they make you fill out extra paperwork.  While they don't know where you're spending it, they'll notice a pattern if you're moving around large sums of cash repeatedly...
Also, I didn't mean to be "complaining," exactly.  More documenting my experience as a tech-savvy, first-time BTC user 9 years into BTC's existence.
