Morgan and the crew spent a day with us at our mine working for some bitcoin. We had a great time and everyone was into understanding it and how the whole system works. Looking forward to seeing the end result of the show.

We took down 150TH of gear and have replaced with about 550TH. You can see us on the Feb 19 episode of Inside Man, Morgan Spurlock came to the mine and worked for a day. We shot the episode in July and were just finishing the build of the Bitfury gear. Now here we are 6 months later replacing all of that with much more effiecient S5's.

It's not cloud mining, they provide hosted solutions -

And from the looks of it Morgan is still holding bitcoin!

The search increase is relevant, it coincides with the CNN show on Feb 19.

Nice work on the show tonight, stop by the mine sometime and lets talk bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:38:03
 - We paid Morgan bitcoin for working at our mine, he is still holding. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:56:39
I did, him and the crew all had a serious interest in bitcoin and spent alot of time understanding our roll as miners. I had no dought they would do a solid job in this episode and keep the view very balanced. Really happy to see how this episode turned out.
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:03:29
You have been able to do that for over a year now at  - they take bitcoin for all almost all major MMO games currency and power leveling services.

He came and worked with us in our mine ( a few shots from in the promo) and the entire crew was very positive about bitcoin. I do not forsee a negative spin on this at all. His approach was very open minded and eager to learn.

The filmed with us in July of 2014
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:38:53
Yep, I had them film the transaction and the blockchain to capture it. Glad it made the edit floor!

Sure. Morgan was very easy to talk to and asked great questions. The day was spent walking through the facility, building miners, racks, discussing bitcoin, mining, the blockchain and the exciting concepts happening around it. The crew and Morgan all had a real interest in absorbing information and seeing the potential of bitcoin.
The mine was a comfortable mid 80s that day, not bad for mid July. It was great seeing how it all came together, I am a fan of the animations they created to simplify the hours of discussion we had! I also like how we captured the payment to him and the transaction popping up on the blockchain. That was a perfect way to wrap up the day and show them everything we had been discussing.. the blockchain in action!

Yep that was us! We just swapped out the bitfury for antminer s5s, added another 500TH -  heres a timelapse of the swap.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:11:44
Upgraded from 150th to just over 500th.

Those are prices for people to host their miners - so they send hardware in or purchase hardware and have it sent. Those prices reflect the cost per kwh on a persons owned hardware. That is not cloud mining. Cloud miners you do not own hardware - you buy contracts. At GigaWatt people own the hardware.
