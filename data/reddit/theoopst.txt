Game.com just joined up with TRON (TRX). Wonder if Steam and Microsoft are looking into other cryptocurrencies, or just dropping it entirely.

Jealous, my first buy was at 18, then 17. Luckily it ain't much. So it's still fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:39
Ha, I don't even know what that is!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:18
I first bought at 18 then at 17. Don't feel bad, don't play with enough that will.

E-panhanding? I'm not above that! Let me Google wtf that is and how to do it. Edit:

Me too my dude.

Thanks! I haven't seen anything come through, but everything coinbase is slow, so maybe it's that. I'll post what I get if it doesn't get taken in fees haha.

I bought in at 18k, I'll HODL. Also take donations. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:04
I doubt it'll go less then 14. Edit: never proven wrong so fast lol

U rite. Me rong. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:02:20
Same here, luckily I saved 20% of my limits just for something like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:01:15
Psh, real morons like me bought in at 18k!

But isn't RFID becoming the standard? That paired with a relational database can do everything a barcode can at potentially 100x the rate. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 02:18:28
At that scale though, your ROI could easily offset that. The more you scale, the more the cost "concern" is lessened due to the value of features. But again, it would depend on the project.
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:00:10
And a printed barcode will never be as useful as RFID. Cost isn't always of concern. All depends on the use case.
Edit: down votes because? Poor human sad that readable text is inefficient?!
@_date: 2019-02-19 01:02:20
I think we disagree on what "of concern" means. The goals of RFID and barcodes can be vastly different. I'd say if cost is ever "of concern", a barcode will meet that need. The RFID projects I'm on, cost is low priority. That also deals with tracking, which barcodes can't handle in our environment.
