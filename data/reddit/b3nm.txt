A casual user might go for a low fee thinking 'no problem I can wait a few hours' not realising that 'slow confirmation' actually means weeks at this point.

There was a thread on here recently where some guy had money stuck on GDAX... thread was full of non-crypto types bashing the OP, coinbase and CC in general, telling him he deserves to lose the money, laughing about it etc.

To be fair, the market didn't seem to care when he was calling it a fraud either... in fact the price was booming. Now that Jamie is on board I'm expecting a sharp correction.

Do you get paid in bitcoin? Do you have to pay bills in bitcoin? Would you be happy to put up with fluctuating fees for doing so?
Right now I get paid in dollars, it's easy to pay my bills in dollars and my debit card is instant and free.
Bitcoin has the potential to be disruptive but I think we still have a way to go. I feel that the parabolic rise in value is anticipating future utility rather than occuring as a result of it.

This comment reeks of insecurity. Believe it or not, some people care about other things.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:55:08
This isn't what you think it is. The transaction hasn't been mined in 100,000 blocks or anything.  That number is basically just a counter showing the number of valid blocks since the the one that included the transaction. It's called a confirmation because each mined block essentially revalidates the entire chain behind it.

@_date: 2017-12-04 03:27:07
Sure, anything is possible.
One of bitcoin's strengths is that if miners act in their own best interests, security is maintained. A 51% attack could happen tomorrow, but it's unlikely to as the perps would be screwing themselves along with everyone else.

Netflix and Amazon were disruptive because people used their services over other 'traditional' services. Most of us buy some bitcoin and then just sit on it, waiting for the moon.
For bitcoin to disrupt banking it needs to be used transactionally, and the only way that will ever happen (scaling aside) is if that graph flattens out and simply hodling makes no more sense than transacting with it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:42:37

@_date: 2017-12-18 08:51:58
It's not a beta. The software works as it was intended. Demand is outpacing network performance. Satoshi himself cautioned about growing too quickly but people are people so we all pile on when there's money to be made... and here we are with a Tx backlog.

Consider the mining farms with 1000s of ASICs running in parallel 24/7. Consider how much more powerful those setups are compared to your your lone 1070 (many orders of magnitude). Consider the miniscule percentage of global hashpower you represent, then decide if you want to take a punt!

It'd be cool if it were Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:27:25
Yes but the price graphs of the first 2 follow that trajectory because they provided a better more convenient option than their competition. 
Right  now it's still much more convenient to use my credit/debit card to buy stuff, so bitcoin isn't (yet) beating the competition in the same way as amazon or netflix is.

Thanks I didn't know that. Mine went from $250 to $2000 based on transactions. It's only been a couple of months though so maybe it will rise again? I don't use it much either anymore.

1. Make sure all of your info is present and correct.
2. Make a few transactions and they will raise your limit.

The fact that he hates talking about it makes me think it was BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-24 21:55:00
They're saying it because that's what it was intended to be. 'Store of value' is a convenient excuse for the fact that bitcoin hasn't scaled fast enough to keep up with demand.

These people always talk about the price of 'a bitcoin' and ask why it should be worth [insert current price] but in reality 'a bitcoin' is an almost arbitrary unit.
1 satoshi is worth around 0.8cents. That sounds pretty reasonable to me.
Their version is akin to asking "how can $1 possibly be worth 22,000 vietnamese dong??"They're just using larger or smaller units to quantify an value.

I guess if you buy now you will have coins on both chains and this will remove the uncertainty about choosing the 'wrong' coin after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:17:41
It doesn't have to 'race' to 18000, it could also do it gradually, or in a series of peaks and troughs...
...and you'd still be doubling your money.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:06:08
This is true and I guess it's inevitable to a degree. There is however a subset of bitcoiners that seem to regard it as an electronic store of value rather than an actual transactional currency.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:53:08
I'm going to buy the dip at $7999...
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:32:04
The thing is, if and when there is a 'clear winner' after the fork, all the money will be piling on. Understand you support 1x but you wouldn't want to pick it up cheap because the market is surging over to 2x. 
Not knowing how it's going to play out, I'm planning on taking some gains into alts just before the fork then ride my remaining btc and see what comes out in the wash.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:37:54

I'm sure such big purchases would happen off the exchanges anyway so as not to push the price up (until they're bought in of course).

True enough but saying 'improvements are in the works' is not the same as saying 'bitcoin is a store of value, not a currency'. 
The store of value view can only stand in the way of progress.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:21:07
