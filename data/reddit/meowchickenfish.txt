Ends up on the front page anyways.  Bitcoin memes don't stop for your nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:28:19
You need patience while daytrading.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:12:56
You're not leaving Reddit so hello. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:14:52
What will happen in 2030?
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:54:29
Hes from Doge
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:38:07
Wow, the ledger resets its self...that's scary. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:51:21
I see it on the front page, is this bot broken?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:15:19
Whats happening in 2020?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:31:16
I mean did you do your research? Nah you didn't
Coinbase caused this drop by adding bcash
I'm not complaining but everyone is an "expert" on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:22:14
Yes. Find a better place to use or start your own.  Oh wait, you won't.

I recently joined a premium signals trading group on Telegram, to the moon we go! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:00:23
Its like when video games come out and on the first day there is tons of lag because the traffic is high.  Same thing is happening here. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:02:55
What platform is your coins on?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:07:22


Can you sell immediately too?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:07
Should have waited
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:20:53
My USD pretends to be currency all the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:08:07
It really doesn't matter since the traffic is high when something new comes out. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:57:58
Why not gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:03:16
It's open on binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:10
define mempool? Memepool?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:40:06
How much is your tax?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:55:13
Yes.  Each subreddit has a general opinion and will downvote if you don't believe what they believe. It happens when you have subreddits that used to be filled with hate and now are canned. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:31:28
What's the difference between Bank and Wire transfers? The time limit?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:25:26
You can do this to any human. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:56
oooo no binance :(
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:48:50
It's the validity of the person, which are using alts to drive his/her point. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:32:47
HE THOUGHT BITCOIN WAS GOING TO $0 lolololololol
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:44:06
Why is it dumb?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:29:07
It's good cash, 1,400,000...

Who calls Bitcoin a cult? If anything, reddit is a cult. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:10
Binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:10:20
What's the state tax for NY?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:50:25
Leave then :D
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:59:41
Feelsbad.jpg I recently moved all my bittrex to binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:20:38
Thats not smart
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:27:58
The people freaking out are the ones who bought it when it was 19k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:30:05
It could be a shill or multiple of them.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:04
I gained it all at $0.  Hence why I am HODLing.  I got .05 bitcoin in 2015 from reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:57:31
Why 50% in taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:29:33
Sucks that you cant convert the alts fully to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:47:49
The future is fresh
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:02:55
Onion shops?

Bitcoin Cash*
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:36:03
You are correct
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:34:49
Can you transfer from my wallet to cash app to sell btc?
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:40:08

@_date: 2018-12-26 05:54:31
I love a good tipping bot!
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:16:23
Giving out BTC out like candy lol!
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:03:31
but it's provocative. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:02:25
Russians live in 2019 before us. The Russian bots make sense. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:00:01
It's the best way to increase people's usage of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:59:18
Can we enable this bot into discord? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:55:48
I remember those days from 200 to 20k
