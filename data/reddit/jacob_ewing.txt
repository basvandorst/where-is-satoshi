[A quick and interesting video about Brazil's economy](
Not related to Bitcoin, but it gives a good perspective on why BTC would be taking off.

:) It already hit 25,000 CAD today.  Feels good.

That's good to know, thanks!  I'm more concerned about logging onto blockchain.info to transfer the coins.  Especially since I'd like to try a tiny transfer first to make sure I know what the hell I'm doing :)

I'm a bit late on the answer here, but can personally vouch for canadianbitcoins.com.
Full disclosure:  I used to work extremely closely with/for them, having been employed by a sister company in the same office.
It's a small company in Ottawa, run by a guy who was into bitcoins back when they were worth fractional pennies.  Honest people, very careful with the money and won't set you wrong.
I'd say the only drawback is that - being a brokerage - the price spread is always wider than what you'd get buying/selling directly on a trading site.

Were there any other hard splits aside from "bitcoin cash" that I should be able to access as splits of my existing bitcoins?

Could someone give me an idea whether or not the "Newton" exchange I'm seeing ads for on this subreddit is legit?  "No-fee cryptocurrency trading for Canadians. Buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Litecoin instantly." sounds great and too good to be true.  Anyone familiar with it?
(edit - I assume the free trade prices are just there to build up a customer base.  It's written into the agreement that they can add/remove/alter fees without notice)

*cries*  I had about 70 of them and sold them all off at a good profit when they were around $150 each.
Retirement would've been nice.

So I try going through setting up a a bank account and they're asking for the account number and password?  This is getting my back up even more...

I have a hard time believing that will be consistent, but it does seem to follow that growth pattern.
\- In 2011 it was under a dollar, then did a spike up to $30, dropped back down to about two or three dollars, then started a long steady growth
\- in early 2013 it did a spike to $200, then dropped to about $100, then started a long steady growth
\- in late 2013 it spiked up over $1000, then dropped as low as $400, then started a long steady growth
\- in late 2017, it spiked up to almost $20,000 then dropped to around $3500, and is now growing...
Hopefully that pattern will continue for some time yet, but maybe I'm just seeing what I want to see.

I did, but it really sounds scammy and bullshit.  Take for example:


That means pretty much nothing to me, what little I can glean from it sounds like a pyramid scheme.

Does anyone know what the heck "HEX" is?  I get that it's a new crypto, and gather that it incorporates interest..
I saw (on the pirate bay) that it's free for bitcoin holders, but I really don't understand what it is or if I should even give it any attention.  Is it another branch off the bitcoin chain?
Anyone care to fill me in on this?

Interesting.  In an online game I was just talking to a 16-year-old from Sweden who told me he had gotten his first credit card.  This rather shocked me (being from Canada myself), but this seems to explain why teenagers would get credit cards there.

Confirmed - it was indeed a communication error.  Much less interesting.
