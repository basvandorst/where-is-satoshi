What about someone who bought in and has been trading between coins and making gains but hasn't withdrawn anything to bank accounts?  
Do I have to report that now?  Can I just report when I withdraw/sell for USD?

Me too, lost my big brother to drugs when we were teenagers.  Total mindfuck heart ripping disaster.  15 years later he's still my big bro.  Much love guys

Just don't overextend your investment to the point where you feel the need to panic sell at a loss.  Patience and profit later.

You can trade instantly when using a credit card for the purchase.

The single most beautiful rebuttal to old men arguing to me that "crypto funds terrorism."

Most of us can relate.  Coinbase probably prevented me from a couple terrible decisions by freezing my Bitcoin for 7 days after purchase lol just go with it *high five*

YES!  I'm just a few months in and lost my mind during the bcash frenzy!  Lost money too.  Then I started seeing posts about buying the dip and comedy memes and started feeling the light at the end of a dark living room couch.  Sold off my bcash and got my first pair of balls.  Oh, did I mention I'll be eating one of them if BTC hits–

Just made my first purchase using BTC: Ledger wallet lol

Then the undead dragon (Bitcoin) raped and pillaged all sorts of kingdoms and lands and shit.

Tried but Coinbase frozen... *shakes fist in the air *

"I'm encouraging people not to go head first now because of greed."
How is investing now more risky than any other time Bitcoin had grown exponentially?  I would argue that it's safer now because of market cap growth and more adoption.  You're either an idiot or completely full of shit.  Good luck with your predictions but everyone holding disagrees, otherwise, we'd sell (and not because a stranger said so on reddit).

Ya man, yesterday was smooth sailing.

Unless you:  Pay with credit card.  Instant transfer to GDAX.  Exchange for Litecoin or Ethereum for faster transfer to exchanges.  Buy a bunch of shitcoins.  Watch them bleed as BTC moons. &lt;-----me+you
