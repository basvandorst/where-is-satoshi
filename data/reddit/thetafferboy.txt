It's not smart to ask people how many bitcoin they have or for them to say how many bitcoin they have, as this can make them a target for hackers.

Found the new guy.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:38:08
What is a 'Traders family'?
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:29:40
Well.. A 1% reward.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:48:45
I guy I know got crowdfunding to make exactly this 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:20:35
I think you've misunderstood what he is saying.
He is trying to undermine the logic that growth from $100 to $4000 denies a bubble because he demonstrating people buying tulips before the crash could have used the same argument.

By your same logic, dogshit is real but it's not the real anyone is paying for... Which was point. The gold doesn't have innate value because it's "real".
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:47:11
I’ve definitely spent more time gaming than reading about Bitcoin, yeah.

It's almost like you're just making up statistics to back up your own point.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:58:43
Nice try, tax man!

Been in Bitcoin since 2013 and long-time Steam gamer, I didn't know this.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:04:49
You know your point is lost when you start a sentence with




What property does gold have that can't be replaced? People like it as jewellery, it's easy to work with. There aren't many tasks where something can't be substituted for gold.


What, if there were loads of it... Like say... [Diamonds]( Because they're cheap.. Right??

[Cryptograffiti.info is a web service that allows people to encode hidden messages into Bitcoin’s blockchain using a special online interface. It has recently added a new and possibly revolutionary functionality — JPG image writing to the blockchain.](
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:15:00
You can encode images on the bitcoin blockchain.

*uninstalls BOINC*
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:56:25
Then it can be removed. You can't remove it from the blockchain, that is the whole point of this thread.
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:55:39
I think the guy's point was more it can't be deleted, so it's forever there for the victim.
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:40:06
I think his point was more that it can never be removed for be victim.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:13:44






This definitely sounds like the correct stranger from the internet to be taking financial advice from.
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:57:41
and it can be removed... So it's not following the same logic at all.

Hi, sorry for noob question. Wut segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:52:38
I used to run a full BTC wallet and moved to Electrum for speed. What is BIP39?

Because there is more value in having a brief answer from a community member with context that I could follow up with specific questions, maybe learn something outside of what I originally searched for?
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:51:36
I feel you. I was just on default Electrum dynamic... *I may be here a while*

Saw the same advice in January when I was told "Oh, it's a $1,000, you should sell now as it will crash as lots of people sell".
Oh hai, $2,700.
