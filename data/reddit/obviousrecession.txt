Because you missed completely missed played the greatest bull run in history
In the greatest stock period in history YOU HELD GOLD
If you bought Leaps the day trump announced the tax cuts you would have gotten like 10 to 1 returns based on strike price
If you couldn't figure out that corporate tax cuts increase corporate stock price your a fucking retard
There was a dude who bouht back to back leaps from the day trump was elected and turned a $100,000 into $2,000,000

What do you think the drug cartels/prior millitary/prior police officers/prior violent offenders are going to do in the scenario the government dissolves and there is no longer law and order?
If you truly believe USD wont survive the collapse of the government you must be smart enough to realize you wont survive either
  
Bitcoin will become literally worthless in the collapse of the US government
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:44:15
First of all i'm talking about since the day Trump announced the corporate tax not the 2008 recession.


If the annual growth of stocks is GREATER THAN THE INTEREST RATE ON YOUR LOAN WHY WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING BUT BUY STOCKS? If interest rates are near 0% and the annual return of the SPY is 10% why the fuck wouldnt you take out as big a loan as possible and just buy up stock? You have to be fucking disabled to not understand this
This is so PAINFULLY OBVIOUS
BTW I've doubled my money on EA calls twice this week. Hows holding bitcoin going?
Most importantly in the scenario my stocks go to worthless and the US government collapses your bitcoin is literally useless because I will be kicking down your door and taking everything you own because the government will no longer exist to maintain law and order
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:00:52
why the fuck did you hold gold during the longest bull run in history
You are the worst investor I have ever seen in my life. It would be more financially responsible to literally just burn 5% of you income a year and throw the rest in an ally savings account
Why the fuck when Trump announced tax cuts did you not buy LEAPS on SPY? What the fuck
Holy fuck
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:24:58

In the Philippines presidential candidates for the previous election had their buses hijacked and the police  who escorted them were killed and then the entire campaign staff was executed and thrown in a mass grave
But you believe that you are better at defending your self then the presidential candidates of a third world nation? In mexico hundreds of campaigning elected officials were executed in the last election. Hell in Afghanistan an insider threat attempted to assassinate a US general and got close but was only able to kill the Afghani general. But you believe that you will be able to survive in this environment?
But you literally believe that you who will be extremely wealthy in this time period because of owning bitcoin that you will be able to outlast all of those who will be targeting you for your wealth?

If you bought a leap within 6 months of the start of every single recession in the stock market history it would have came profitable 
2008, 2000, great depression it doesn't matter leaps within 6 months of the official start of a recession have always been profitable. LITERALLY ALWAYS
You cannot find a single point in time in which this play has been unprofitable unless you choose a retard strike price 
Your too dumb to understand actual investing so you gamble away on fucking bitcoin LOL
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:16:11
The market has always advanced for the entirety of its existence
A LEAP(year out call) has been profitable HISTORICALLY in 100% of recessions if taken 6 months after the start
IT would have been profitable after the great depression although derivatives didn't exist at the time. It was profitable after the dotcom crash, it was profitable after the 2008 recession
Assuming that the average period between recessions is 10 years and you buy leaps for 10 years then you will lose 100% of your money in one of those years and the losses will be carried by the gains from every other year. This is how investing works you retard
I dont know why your making the assumption someone would put 100% of their portfolio in spy leaps? No one invests like that. Losing 100% of a LEAP doesnt matter because the next 90% of them will be profitible
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:40:13

I'm fucking Korean and I live in Korea number 1
Number 2 this has nothing to do with if bitcoins usefulness or the block chains usefulness it has to do with people who know absolutely nothing about the financial markets and literally didn't own any type of investment until bitcoin came around and they started wildly gambling while giving out their shitty advise thinking they have some deep understanding of what will happen. There is literally nothing in the world I hate more than retards in the financial markets.  I cashed out when BTC hit a $1000 and I bought back in after retards who HODL when ross was arrested should be gassed. HODL isnt a fucking strategy

If you bought yearly leapcalls from 2008 till 2018 years youd have a higher return rate than buying into bitcoin at $100 and selling at 20k

Yea but the return rate on you investment has been pretty bad for the year
it has all the risk of options but less reward for the majority of "investors"
If you want to buy high risk high reward investments just buy EA  weeklies lol 2% daily swings up and down its nuts.  I trippled my money last night lost  90% of it got it all back 
All inned Friday FD ea drops 2% now its only down 1% I dont break even for another 1% rip

The entire premise is based on BTC displacing USD
If the legitimacy of the government is threatened there is literally nothing off the table
Do you actually believe if the governments authority was threatened they would care about "wasting money" or someones investments? In china they throw people in concentration camps and kill protesters, do you actually believe they care about either morality or wasting money? In china they build world record setting bridges....just to do it

What im saying is if people want to put blind faith in something and all in its far more rational to all in yearly Spy calls than fucking bitcoin
You win in like 90% of years and your gains will cover your losses for the 10% that do fail
There is no rational reason on the face of the earth to buy bitcoin as an investment anymore. If you actually do the fucking math bitcoin doesnt come close in total return rate unless you got in sub $100. Its a horrible investment for 99% of people who bought into it when they could have just bought LEAPS but thats what actual investors do not retards
There was a dude who bought LEAPS at $100k in 2016 when Trump announced the corporate tax cuts and sold them at a $1 million in 2017. He could have done that every fucking year since 2008 but was a big pussy
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:01:31

@_date: 2018-12-05 22:50:39
Because people take low risk investment's in recessions
If they wanted to take high risk investments theyd sell calls over bitcoin 
The return to risk of bitcoin is irrational, you would have done far better selling puts for the past 2 years than holding bitcoin for a less risk
The greatest yearly bitcoin rise is the same as buying leap calls on the spy
If you wana gamble why not quit being a pussy and just buy puts if you believe the market will tank, youl make far more money
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:19:06
Do you believe the majority of bitcoin users will continue to use it when its constantly under attack by the worlds governments?

Once the price drops bitcoin becomes worthless as a currency and their goal is achieved as people will continue to use FIAT instead of crypto

If you only look at whats around you then yea Myspace will stay forever it has no real competition.
The difference between owning stocks and owning BTC is diversity, some companies fail while others succeed, owning bitcoin is going all in on 1 company. Its inherently riskier and inherently more rewarding. Theres no guarantee itl stick around in 50 years and I personally don't believe it will as technology marches onward
In fact all of the market incentive in the world is in creating a better coin. You will make infinitely more money by creating a new competing coin than improving existing ones because you can mine far more. There is no real market incentive to improve bitcoin. Ex  Ethereum

The premise is based on the idea that that USD and therefore the government can be dethroned by bitcoin
If the government LEGITIMATELY believed that their currency was going to be displaced by bitcoin it becomes the largest national security threat since WW2

Return rate 2016-2017 all in rolled 100 to 1
There was a university professor in the news because he turned 100k into 2m  2016-2017 on conservative leaps
If you rolled leaps for the last decade you would have won every time btw but not nearly at the rate of 2016 and 2017 but you would have doubled your money  most years depending on sell point although there have been some times youd have been mostly wiped out and if you held out you would have gotten it back

War is actually becoming substantially cheaper if you dont care avout civilian casualties so if we must fight wars but cant take out debt to do so we will just trade morality for cost efficiency
If you remove the financial abilities to fund large scale more morslly concious wars the alternative is cost effective wars. Whats more cost effective than a targeted missle? Cluster bombing,  whats even more effective? Chemical weapons

Literally 6 months after the start of any recession a leap call has been profitable if you take it within 5%. Literally 100% of the time leap calls have been profitable from this stage and will have a multitudes higher return rate than fucking bitcoin going to 20k
You could buy leaps for the exact same amount of risk for a substantially higher reward

im a pretty hard bitcoin skeptic and legitimately believe its not worth holding long term but if it hits the thousand mark id prolly buy calls on it

You love tbis movie but are making retarded financial decisons
Did you not learn anything from the movie. All bull runs come to a hard crash and those who ride till the end go bankrupt

They were happy to sell the position becuase they had a win win situation. If they fail the government bails them out.
Trying to time the exact moment of a movement is often retarded its why options are generally only used to hedge. The difference between a  call this week and next is the difference between 400% profit and 100% losses
Being early is the same thing as being wrong
I can tell you with absolute certainty EA will hit 100 a share eventually. But picking the timing on this is impossible
Also link your portfolio you know absolutely nothing about the market

Link your portfolio
I had 4to1 returns on my EA FDs last friday. It moved like 2% that day on a spike
Broke ass

If the stock market crashes hard before then im all in on spy leap calls with everything I own fuck Ill take out loans if it hits down 40% for the year. I dont see bitcoin rising in a global recession 
If the market rebounds and bitcoin is still under 2\~2.5k ill buy in a decent amount

How will loans be handled?
How will margin work?

bitmain holds nearly 51% as is 
If you think the government is against killing people to sustain it self you are retarded.

Investing is not always at a loss
If rhe day trump announced corporate tax cuts you bought leaps and rolled them youd have 10 to 1 returns on the safest bet in the world
Gambling on crypto is where you lose money

Literly dozens of funds werr taking short positions since 2006
Peter shciff made 8 to 1 returns off the housing collapse
It was far more common than the movie makes it seem. That isnt even counting general short positions against the market as a whole not just housing 
You arnt an investor your a low risk gambler

Dude your so fucking deep into despair you are coming up with the most abnormal situations possible in which bitcoin catches on
I dont even worry about options calls going to $0 as much as you people panic over bitcoin. Although I assume most of you have 0 diversification and are all in

Because combat training made the soviets effective against the mujahideen
Just being able to afford "combat training" doesn't make it an effective fighting force
