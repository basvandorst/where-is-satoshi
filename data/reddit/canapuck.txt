Broke through, had to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:27:00
I bought in at 8500, the charts look slightly trending upward though, definitely not doing the same as it was before it hit 6000.

For the olympic flame!
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:11:46
Not too hard to guess a general direction based on recent trends...
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:31:32
I studied technical analysis and came up with support at 1337, it seemed to be more than just a number.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:50:23
Very clear head and shoulders, hasnt broke through yet though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:07:11
Needs to break 9500 to confirm breakout from bear trend, still long way to go.
Its fun to bet on the bull though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:01:53
its pretty obvious the amount of btc dumped at the same time when around 6600, now it was dumped in heavily to bring back down at 7200...
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:48:43
Yet you are the one who is wrong? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:01:11
just bought in today, not a negative outlook.  I'm a one day reddit expert...

Just bought in a 8500, preparing to hodl long term....

whales selling off...
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:43:42
I just bought some more at 8175...
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:28:54
You can wait until it goes lower and still believe in crypto!

I have been watching the market for the past week or so, while it may currently be a bull trap, there are some signs this thing is turning around.
Then again, it may plummet much much lower, but I put my money on it going up.
Edit: I have been eyeing bitcoin since August, but didnt buy in then, and also clearly didnt buy in on the massive upswing as I thought it was a bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:46:57
It's blasting off hard! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:22:21
The volume is only $40000 looks like someone is intentionally pumping it up to make a point?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:35:34
Hodl the line! Stay with me! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:40:09
I personally used an extrapolative ruler linear analysis and concluded that the straight line was converging on itself in a downward trend.
My pencil came to the end of the ruler and concluded that that must be bottom, it was at negative $300, likely increasing the spring of the bounce back by 3x and it should be at 75k by weeks end. /s
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:00:31
luckily i only put in 20% of intended buy in
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:18:54
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:23:27
Opinions: have we hit a bottom or are we going to drop back down to 6k and lower?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:07
Whales puttin cash in...
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:45:55
If it breaks through 8500, you could be getting a very big breakfast :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:46:31
Bitcoin won't be resurrected till Easter at this rate.. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:29
Capitulation 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:12
10x more media exposure for one.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:42:40
Seems to be strong resistance at 8100
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:34:07
What we do in life, echoes in cryptocurrency... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:46:40
Hmm, yea I don't think it can turn around this quickly, likely another downturn, but who knows maybe it gets some support again and it levels off, time will tell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:28:17
Think it is closer to the denial stage
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:39:58

Here is my techincal Analysis
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:34:21
Hi guys, just been observing for a while, plan on getting in to the crypto soon.  From my non invested outlook, I think this thing is dropping down to the 2-3000 range for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:10:00
Pretty sure I have yet to see a technical analysis be correct.
