My coworker is in for 2000 to Butterfly labs.  He is never gonna see that hardware.  I guarantee it.

It could just be a clerical issue.

I bought a few at $20? Maybe $50 a few years back. Man I wish I still had them.

No.  Does it sound like I do?  Is that a compliment or an insult?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:49:31
I dunno, if the Senate hearings go well, probably close to 1000, if not, close to 200.

I like this mining calculator a lot more than the basic ones.  It tends to temper my enthusiasm for acquiring mining hardware at all cost.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:56:54
I snagged a couple of BTC while it was up.  Been hesitating on the "Buy" button for two weeks.  First at $300, then at $500.  Fuck I wish I had bought some at $300.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:10:41
This is cool to look at for sure, and last year at this time would have reprsented a virtual gold mine.
My guess is OP bought the eruptors with bitcoins he had already mined, so it didn't really cost him any USD unless you count the opportunity cost of converting those BTC to USD and deposting them.
For sure, they're more novelty at the 1.99 BTC price than investments.  Still cool to see all of them, though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:20
It will need to have a cap in the trillions to go mainstream.  Think about that, it needs to be about 100x it's current market cap to be reliable.

*probably not, at least with the USB miners.
@_date: 2013-06-02 02:33:23
The only way conventional hardware bought now will be profitable is if the value of BTC doubles up every six months or so AND the difficulty goes up at the same rate it does now...which are two things that don't happen together.  If the value goes up, the hash rate is going to go up exponentionally.  In fact, just since I started looking at Bitcoin about five weeks ago, the hashrate has gone up by 50%. (80 Th/s --&gt; 120 Th/s).
Also, I said "Enthusiasm."  Thus far, all I've acquired is a 7970 and a new case, both of which have alternate value outside of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:53:23
Odd, because I just went o eBay and searched "Bitcoin" under computer components and parts and there's at least a half dozen Block Eruptor auctions going on.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:02:38
You can pay for one of these miners, but it might never show up or it might show up so late that you won't be able to recoup your investment.
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:01:27
I'm jealous. Apparently BFL states they will start shipping all products soon since they just got the long boards in.  I'm hoping so, since I bought a little single (25 Gh/s) and would like that box to show up at my door. Enjoy!
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:42:16
It is anonymous if you only use BTC.  If you convert it to dollars, then not so much.
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:35:44
I notice the OP hasn't said anything about acquisition costs.  Not even anything to dispell any rumors that he got a sweetheart deal or anything like that.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:03:14
Hey, thanks for the confidence!  You're really building it up!  These ASICs will still be in short-ish supply because there will be a physical limit to how many can be built in that time period.  25 Gh/s won't be as big a number then, I'm sure, but it will still probably turn enough money to cover its costs and make a tidy profit.  Hey, let's look on the bright side: if the difficulty keeps going up, some people will drop out because it won't make cents.  (or BTC, if you're that kind of person.)
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:20:08
I'd settle for about 3.50
@_date: 2013-05-07 07:54:05
Power usage is of little concern compared to the opportunity-cost of not having these machines now.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:05:39
They were overpriced at 10Mil difficulty, and now it's at almost 20Mil.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:42:56
I think banks have to notify the IRS of large deposits or something like that.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:20:58
Well, I guess it's for the best right now, since the price I bought at was around $100 more than the current price.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:39:01
Remember when average users could profitably mine with video cards?  Pepperidge Farms remembers.

Running through their forums and twitter account, reading snippets here and there.
@_date: 2013-05-29 03:27:03
500,000 chips!  That's 141Th/s at their rated 280 Mh/s!
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:04:28
Aren't there close to a million Avalon chips on order.  If that's the case, at 300Mh/s/chip, you're looking at 300 Th/s just on order from Avalon, or tripling the current Th/s rate once they're all online.  And that's just Avalon. It might fluctuate a bit as a whole bunch of GPU miners drop off, but it's just going to keep going up.
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:16:13
At first I was jelly, then I realized he paid &gt;72BTC, then I was like "well, I guess he had the BTC."  I do not have that kind of BTC.

Nice watches!  I don't wear watches, but if I did, I would definitely consider one of yours.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:14:25
Avalon's not the only player in the game, though.  BFL seems to be finally shipping, and they might add another 100,000 - 500,000 chips, with each chip capable of 4Gh/s.  I predict in a year, maybe two at the most, network strength will be 1000 Th/s.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:13
Is it crashing now?
edit: ...and it's back.
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:48:29
Le sigh.  I am trying to remain optimistic about BFL, since I am on order for the 25 Gh/s unit, but I, too, am afraid that it will be little more than a novelty by the time they actually ship.
I have noted, optimistically, I guess, that global hash rate has actually fallen somewhat since the last increase in difficulty, which might help keep difficulty down.
I knew the BFL was a gamble, but we'll see.  Apparently they ARE shipping some jalapeno's.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:57:08
All I have to say to this is...fuck.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:59:21
I ordered just the other day.  I think I saw somewhere that orders placed now(ish) would ship in 2-3 months.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:16:16
I can only assume you mean buying something with Bitcoin was awesome, not the sandwich itself.
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:40:10
Interesting.  I might play around with that a bit, I mean, heck, they're only like $35.  However, I'm thinking the quickest and easiest way to go is get a low-power laptop and configure it to just stay on all the time.

@_date: 2013-05-02 16:00:27
Other than the ASIC, the other hardware will be remarkably unchanged in a few months.  Besides, planning ahead doesn't hurt, even if those plans are subject to change :)

Thanks for the SubReddit link!  Did not know it existed.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:01:21
This is not the same.  If you cash out one bitcoin, you will owe capital gains taxes, which is a percentage of what you cashed out.  The stock options scenario you described is different.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:21:01
Well, obviously, this is a much higher performance/watt/$ proposition.  Running general purpose hardware would take at least 5 computers and 20+ GPU's.  I mean, my numbers might be a bit off, you can prove that one computer can run 7 video cards.  But those cards are $400 - $500 each.
You can think of it like the government does.  They invest in all sorts of stuff that never pans out because they don't know what will be a winner and what won't.  Yeah, I might have just thrown $1200 away, but it's no worse than buying $1200 worth of lottery tickets, only I think there's a better chance of Butterfly Labs shipping than winning the lottery jackpot with $1200 worth of tickets.  If it works out, it will pay for itself.  If not, I guess you'll be able to find me on the street corner.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:12:54
Western Union, credit cards, gold, silver, foreign currencies, *Tide* laundry detergent, precious metals...anything that represents a fungible value that can be traded for goods and services...can be used by terrorists.
Some terrorists don't even try to hide it anymore, they just go up to HSBC and open a banking account and deposit their terrorist money.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:00:01
How many eruptors is that?
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:49:37
Like I said, I'll look into it.  It'll probably be a few months till I have to worry about it anyways.
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:48:57
It's still rocking more power than the 178 Mh/s I'm getting from my current computer.  
In case you're wondering, I literally just started mining today, but I've been reading about it for a few days.  So, why would I go with the ASIC out of the box?  I figure, I can go big(ish) or go home.  I figure this will be the first step to making a small fortune, or I just burned $1200 to the ground.  But, hey, I've spent more than $1200 on less-productive endeavors before.

Kind like being in the itty-bitty-titty club?  I had three bitcoin and mined 1/2 bitcoin before mining became ridiculous.  But I foolishly spent 2.5 BTC on upgrading a BFL order.  Dumbest thing ever.  I now have &lt; 1 BTC, something like .97.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:38:20
Bitcoin is not a stock, it is illogical to assume it would behave like a stock.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:17:31
I'm just trying to make the point that for general mercantile usage, there will need to be enough value in circulation for a large population to use it.  Right now, at what, 10 billion or so, it probably could not even cover one day's worth of transactions in, say, NYC.
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:55:26
They would still have held it, and charged you a convience fee, too.
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:50:00
Yes, I meant 6 Th/s.  It's good to know that it fluctuates like that.
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:32:25
I understand they have been experiencing engineering issues until recently.  Hey, who else is actually shipping Bitcoin hardware?
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:56:28
I don't understand how they get away with doing this.  I mean, if freaking Walmart can electronically check your account funds in like ten seconds, you'd think a bank could do it even faster and more reliably.
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:34:22
Most of the non IC parts are probably less than a dollar if manufactured in China and assembled in China.  Speaking of which, assembly probably takes about 5 minutes, so the typical worker could put together 20 of these an hour.  Add in a few minutes for QC.  The most expensive part, aside from the AM chip, is probably the aluminum heatspreader, which might have cost around $1 USD.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:16:24
**T**here, **F**ixed **T**hat **F**or **Y**ou (TFTFY).
Yeah, you can use escrow and get your money back, but in reality what you want is an ASIC miner as soon as possible, so it's a little like getting health insurance revoked and getting your premium refunded instead of them paying for that heart transplant you really need.  You'd rather pay the premium and get what you need instead of getting your money back.
@_date: 2013-06-17 00:01:20
No one knows what the future difficulty will be, since we can't predict how much Th/s is being added.  That being said, the last two increases have been around 25% each, so it's already 50% more difficult in one month.
@_date: 2013-06-23 18:52:06
