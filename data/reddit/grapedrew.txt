I sold my bitcoin.... to buy on margin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:27:30
I sold at 13k because I thought something bad was going to happen :( fuck you FUD 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:34
Why is everyone using GDAX value? On bitfinex it didn't even go past 16k, as far as I'm concerned it never went over 16k. That 19k was just excessive demand and everyone got arbitraged to fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:25:35
Bro bitcoin didn't even reach that value on my exchange..
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:06:37
Very risky as btc has the potential for serious manipulation and isn't backed very well. Personally I wouldn't invest what I'm not happy to lose.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:07:53
Also could easily be replaced by another crypto currency 
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:34:06
I see what you mean, free from regulations! It's almost like it's a precious ore like gold. Thanks for the explanations, you've given me more faith in btc! I'll probably buy more when the time is right:).
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:37:11
Thanks for explaining. 
Manipulation - I guess you are correct with the long term manipulation not being possible, this makes me feel a bit safer. Just short term is possible which I'm not worried about. I'll hodl on and enjoy the ride! 
Backing/ replaceability - surely there are alt crypto currencies that could surpass btc in popularity if backed by a country or large organisation? With the correct advertisement and propaganda. 
 
Muchos Gracias

Thanks for stating your opinion, want to provide some support for it?

The dip isn't over boys
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:35:58
£100 isn't going to do much but do £50 now then £50 when you start regretting you spent the original £50
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:24
Bitfinex is fine :D
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:39:18
Wait wtf, has btc skyrocketed in the last 10 mins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:26:18
I recommend either using coinfloor, coinbase or bitfinex. Will be approx £20 fee for SEPA transfer. I don't see why you should transfer to a wallet unless there is a fork so I'd just keep it held by the exchange. 
I'm 20 (from the UK) and started with an approx investment of £1.2k which is now $4.5k (not sure what that is GDP). Get in there bro.

Panic 
Chill out and wait for it to recover 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:49:33
6-11 now bro
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:14:30
Jesus, chill that's OP's sister 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:10:51
Spend half now, spend half in a few days when the climb has slowed down or when it dips
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:18
Bitfinex is still live ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:22:46
Agreed, for a $100 investment I don't think it's even worth including bitcoin now 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:07:25
Perhaps something needs to be stickied for the average lay person then.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:53:45
Bloomberg livestream will cause a bit of a dip I think 
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:12:18
Loool me too, bitcoin has helped me budget as I transfer everything into bitcoin instead of impulse buying something 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:54:56
Wai doe
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:57:41
It was clearly a joke bru, no-one is going to take a suggestion  to invest your life savings into btc seriously. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:07:21
I can't find an answer to this anywhere... Have you found one yet?!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:00:47
Okay so how do I access the other currency that is split and am I missing out at all by not accessing the other chain? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:08:12
Can someone put it in a readable format, my phone doesn't like this MP4 malarky :( 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:54:13
No.. it's risky as fuck but everyone likes to gamble 
Edit: not quite risky as fuck but it makes me nervous 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:25:33
Buy bitcoin followed by cryo freezing my body to stop me from selling, the ultimate HODL. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:31:06
No loss 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:42:36
Been waiting for a crash before I buy more.. I feel like it's never going to come..
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:13:59
"I hope for the meltdown of all major banks" 
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:41:53
The price reflects what people think, the increase means people are buying uppppp. But will they stop soon? Who knows.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:36:56
It's probably too late to profitably mine bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:48:46
Have you seen any of these before? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:05:10
In the UK 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:54:47
Dogecoin is an example of e-coin, I know that it's a meme and has no chance of being backed. I'm just refering to other currencies which are more viable
Edit: I know it probably wasn't the best thing to put as an example though..
