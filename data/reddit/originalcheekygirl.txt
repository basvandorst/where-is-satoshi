The are more women in this sector than you think. We just let guys do the fighting while we profit from the trades :)

Naughty naughty! Meh... this doesn't really bother the people who actually believe in Bitcoin.  We are all aware this can happen quite often now that Bitcoin is open to the 'big guys' but the more the so called 'officials' do such things, the more people will understand the government manipulation.  Here's to all the revolutionary hodlers!
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:42:41
who cares man, just be like '0 fucks given'
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:46:04
Good choice not hodling on to him! You go girl!

1. Always best to go with your gut instinct after a ton of research.
2. Ofcourse weigh the risk and be ok with it.
3. If you are in it for a short term profit, put a take profit limit and sit back and chill.
If you are in it forever, no point worrying and checking it hundred times a day, just chill.
PS. I must admit even my heart skips a beat sometimes with these FUD and I have got a wee heart. So I don't check the news in the morning but I'm in it foreeeeevvvvvveeeeeerrrrrrrrr

I think everyone loves money more than they care to admit, but Jewish people are smart about it, like adopting new technologies when they see the potential in it :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:40:44

Sorry for your loss.  I hope you and your family get through this rough time.  My thoughts are with you.
Advice for anyone with regrets: Don't poison your mind with 'could've, should've, would've'.  Try and focus your mind to the bright future you want and make that your goal.  Train your brain to think that even if you miss out on something there will be thousands more opportunities coming your way anyway.  Lots of Love.

All the hype and the mess for nothing at the end. Well atleast they realised they were gonna die before they even launched.

Bitcoin Cash happened the first week of August if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:01:37
We broke $6000 mate, now at $7660. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:32:04
I am now a bit confused.  Will we get the same number of coins like bch or naw? urgh fuck segwit 2x man
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:04:50
I was only excited for segwit2x for the free bitcoin I could have potentially made.  Bye for now 2x
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:11:05
You wouldn't have gotten bitcoin cash unless you had bitcoins before the bitcoin cash fork happened. 
And no, we wont be getting free segwit 2x coins cos the fork ain't happening.
Not sure about bitcoin gold though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:39:22
Never bet against bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:07:08
In this case I'd be a guy too then.

...And here I was thinking the Mt Gox Saga was over 
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:36:57
That's the opposite for me, ever time I cash out the price goes down :/ but I'd rather it go up
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:29:48
I don't get the point of marriage. You pay to be with the person and then you pay to get rid of them. What's that about!?

I hope this comes into the attention of people still following him. Maybe it wasn't his intention, but he literally profited from other peoples misery. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:33:46
I agree, he is just another Lord Voldemort in my eyes. The one we shall ignore.
