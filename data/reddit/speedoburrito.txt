Is that the metric? Oh, I guess I should adjust for affluence influence in my objective perspective.

Why is nobody asking how they got a cat to wear a hat? Have any if you tried this? That f*in cat hodls like a boss. I see the rear view shot as a bit metaphorical as well.

I really feel like he's a gov/bank spook, out to trash crypto credibility as a whole. They couldn't get to Bitcoin so they had to make a clone, steal the name and website, load up the bus, and drive it off a cliff. Tinfoil hat perhaps but tell me you don't think the banks play dirty?

Yep. I owed about 32% cap gains last year. It depends on your bracket. If you don't pay and get caught it will cost you a lot more.

1 plant ~ 2-2.5kwh/day... 994kwh/day ~ 400-500 tomato plants. $.25/kwh * 994 = $250/day. 1 plant = 4-6oz tomatoes. Growth cycle ~ 3 months. $250*90 = $22,500. 5oz * 450 = 140lb. $22,500 / 140lb = $160/lb.

What happens when you go to sell the Bitcoin for Fiat and pay the taker fee? You lose 3mil. Or you could always post an order for it all and hope the price doesn't drop significantly before you get the money out, losing tens of millions.

Lots of reasons. Capital gains could be one for those that sold/traded last year (I fit in here sorta, but it hasn't been me selling in 2018 at all, as I'm holding usd so far at least until taxes are square). I believe it's because Bitcoin hasn't proven it's worth these prices yet. Would you rather have 1btc or usd 20k? 15? 10? 5? 2? 1? 0? Time will tell where the consensus lies. I got out at 18.6 and haven't bought back yet as I would rather have the money to buy real estate. Though if it bottoms out and shows stability at a reasonable price I'd go 50% in.

On the contrary. I gained a shitload by selling near the top. I'd be losing my mind stressing out now if I had held.
