uhh lets see you you buy 250,000 bit connect tokens Jan 1 2017 and hold them until today (300$) and you have over $70,000,000 yes thats million. They aren't paying old money with new money entering.. they are paying old money with profits they made off the appreciation of BCC token and not too mention Bitcoin.

Bitconnect is not a Ponzi by any means. I suggest you do some more research. First off the reason the LTD is going to dissolve is because they did not file through the UK companies House but actually filed in July as a Consortia of the Regional Promoters and that license is Valid through November 2019. Also any active users of Bitconnect that loaned out their Bitcoin to Bitconnect actually would have made a greater ROI if they would have just held Bitcoin instead. Also Bitconnect has its own blockchain.. $10,000 into the token on Jan 1st would net you over 70 million today 11 months later. Whereas if you did loans on the platform you're only at $100,000 if that. Very sustainable

Bitconnect token has been one of the top gainers in all of crypto in 2017. On January 1st 2017 if you bought 10,000 BCC tokens and held them till today (300$) those 10,000 tokens would be now worth $3,000,000. These are facts whether you hate Bitconnect or not.. you cannot deny that if this is premined token they hold a majority of the tokens still in their possession. How is 1% daily not sustainable? Even though Bitconnect does NOT promise 1% daily.. their software has averaged .067% over the last 6 months. You would make more money just holding Bitcoin rather than lending to Bitconnect.

Im aware Bitcoin doesn't provide interest?? What I said was anyone who loaned their Bitcoin to Bitconnect would have been better off just holding their own Bitcoin instead because how much the price is appreciating in this free market system. Bitconnect having a blockchain and a working product means a little more than nothing especially when you realize 90% of these cryptos have no real product or use case yet their just speculative ideas.

Please research Bitcoin thoroughly before throwing your money away like that.
