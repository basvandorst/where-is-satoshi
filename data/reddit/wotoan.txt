At certain points it doesn't matter. 
A doctor can't prescribe something that he knows is extremely high risk with little benefit to a patient. An architect can't get the client to assume liability for a beautiful but potentially unsafe design. Finance is a regulated profession, and you can't just offload liability however you wish.

But it doesn't make sense to lock up monthly discretionary spending. It makes sense to use someone else's cash for monthly discretionary spending, then instantaneously settle out of an account that has a yield once a month. That's the intelligent thing to do.
If your system requires extended zero-interest loans to work properly... there are major issues here.

It's free money for a month.
Credit cards and bitcoin are both for respectable people with a steady job and a house in a Western country where police and courts are on stand by to enforce the law. Bitcoin users are certainly not poor, homeless, and in the third world.

Ask VISA. I pay zero interest, and all I have to do is pay in full monthly. That's literally the only condition you have to satisfy.

@_date: 2016-04-15 01:49:07
No, you don't. Other people do. It is literally free money.
Bitcoin isn't boring, it has distinct financial disadvantages when you attempt to use it as money.


If you don't have a bank account or credit card you literally have to purchase bitcoin from a random stranger like a drug deal.
@_date: 2016-04-14 14:34:11
And you see people moving away from that and locking up less and less money every day.
People don't carry lots of cash anymore. A credit card doesn't lock up cash. Paypay is linked to a credit card and doesn't lock up cash.
The only thing that locks up cash are debit and chequing accounts, and smart people minimize the amount of cash that are in those accounts because of the fees and opportunity cost.
@_date: 2016-04-13 23:39:44


And smart people lock up the bare minimum of their wealth in assets that don't yield interest or grow as an investment. In fact, smart people use other people's money for payment purposes, and lock up none of theirs - ie pay with a credit card, and pay it off completely before the payment date.
If you are "locking up" your wealth without being paid for it, you're an idiot. In fact, this is literally what banking is based on - lending your money ("locking it up") to someone else, and being paid for it, via interest or growth.
@_date: 2016-04-14 11:51:33


No they don't. They use other people's cash. That's my entire point. It's an incredibly poor financial decision to lock up cash like this.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:38:21
A credit card doesn't lock up any cash at all. You are using other people's cash, not your own.


Actually, some have the reverse - you get the money before you have to pay it. That's what smart people do.

The idea that people stopped running full nodes solely because of the advice of bitcoin.org is ridiculous.
People stopped using bitcoin-qt because it was slow, less user friendly, consumed vast amounts of hard drive space and network bandwidth, and took literally hours if not days to start up for many people.
People switched over precisely because running a full node was becoming too burdensome. Experienced users stopped. The advice of bitcoin.org followed this trend - it didn't lead it. The market made the choice.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:33:57

Original comment in this chain said:

It's the "make millions of dollars part" that will likely get you into trouble. And even without that, consider something like Bitmain (who are near IPO for what, multiple billions?) claiming that you acted with deliberate malice to interfere with them going public? Or if they can persuade a judge this is the same as someone hacking into a bank and not taking any money (hint: still in legal trouble)?
The issue now is that there is big money (and great lawyers with big retainers) on the line, it's not just "code is law" hacker honor running the show.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:09:29
It became a common belief because bitcoin-qt was a unwieldy resource hungry monster. The belief didn't come from nowhere.
The fact is there is zero economic incentive to run a full node, and as the resources required to run a node go up, the number of people who are willing to do so go down.
Don't blame recommendations or belief, there are structural economic issues which have caused the decline in node numbers. The market has spoken.
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:22:45

All of the quantifiable data points toward climate change being true.
But there's still huge amounts of debate. Why? Because the debate isn't about quantifiable data. It's about manipulation, about emotion, about belief.
People can continue to live the delusion because there are no consequences - they are not "invested" in a sense. And you can't force people to invest. People who don't think global warming is real aren't going to invest in prediction markets, they're just going to think it's more nonsense and keep on believing what they want to believe.

Central banks have nothing to do with verifying money transfers like you're discussing. It's irrelevant if the banks operate in countries with the same central bank or not.
The German to Japanese transfer you're discussing falls under the section "Correspondent Banking" in that article.

Let's go slow: what are things that have all these qualities?
1. You need them to live or be comfortable.
2. They are only attainable by bitcoin.
3. They are not attainable by USD/fiat.
This would indicate that there are inelastic goods out there that would create bitcoin liquidity due to consumer demand, and cause bitcoin to behave as a currency, not as an illiquid commodity.
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:32:29
Bitcoin is useful because it allows monetary transfer without the consent of central authority - that's it.
This is why it will never break into the mainstream - because mainstream activity, by definition, already has the consent of central authority. And there are cheaper, quicker, and easier payment methods to use for activities that are approved by central authorities.
But activity on the fringes - gambling, drugs, blacklisted charities like WikiLeaks - that is the killer app of bitcoin whether many want to admit it or not. And we're seeing it here. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:54:03
For an attack of that size, there are very few organizations with the means (lots of hashing hardware) and the motivation (anti-BCH). There are only so many suspects and a lot of money on the line.

Use value (utility) is not quantified.
You're just repeating thing without understanding them. I want you to think.

Because your definition of "value" is a high school level copy and pasted internet definition. Let's move toward value as we would typically define it in undergraduate economics.

Of course the US dollar relies on the continued operation of it's banks and exchanges, as well as all the companies that accept US dollars around the world.

The entire point of monetary policy is to mitigate volatility of currency - otherwise it's unusable. This is accomplished by varying the rate of money printing, aiming for a small band of inflation that is not negative (very important) and not so high that speculation takes precedence over investment.
This is the entire point - and it makes the USD a great thing to be paid in, not a scary thing to be paid in.
It's kind of funny how you can see the problem with bitcoin, but not realize that monetary policy solves that precise problem.

Can you describe how you'd short sell bitcoin? You can't naked short it. You'd need to find someone who would let you borrow a bunch of bitcoins that you'd then sell on the open market, you attack bitcoin and crash the price, and then you buy the bitcoin back and return it to the person you borrowed from.
Basically not only do you need to hit a successful 51% attack, you need to find a big enough sucker that he's willing to lend you such gigantic amounts of bitcoin that this would be profitable.

Transaction fees aren't the problem. On a dollar debit purchase you're looking at 5% max, and you're selling coffee that cost you ten cents to make.
The issue is speed of turnover. The faster they move people through the line, the more they make.
In fact, they would prefer a system with higher transaction costs that was quicker - remember the shitty MasterCard SpeedPay system they tried to implement before debit came in?
Eliminating transaction costs on a fraction of their purchases saves them effectively nothing. Speeding up the entire line so you can serve 400 people instead of 300 in the morning rush? Massive increase in revenue.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:39:09
But all fiat money is debt. Every cent of it. There's no point where you aren't in debt, and then you spend too much, and then are in debt. It's all debt.

The point is that there are very few barriers to entry. In terms of actual function (ie transactions processed per second) the amount of hashing power required is quite low.

Yes, but there's only one niche for bitcoin miners to exploit - SHA256 hashes as fast as possible for the least amount of power cost. There are no other niches or boutique demands for smaller players to fill.
No matter how cheap hardware gets, it will always be cheaper for large players to buy in bulk versus small players buying in small volumes. Power is always cheaper in volume, and large players can relocate to places with the cheapest power. I can easily see a future where bitcoin mining is only profitable if you have free power or super-low industrial power rates. And why would hardware manufacturers ever sell to small players if a large company says "we'd like to buy everything please" and comes in with a good deal?

The IRS provided guidance that Bitcoin should be treated as property for tax purposes, and not as a foreign currency. That's fucking it. They didn't say "hurr durr we now declare this not to be money".
You do not need to use a monetary instrument in order to be charged with money laundering. In fact, much money laundering involves moving through non-monetary instruments to hide the origin of the funds.

Intrinsic value is a useful descriptive concept in economics that can be clearly defined.
Economics, at its most base, is the study of resource allocation. These resources have value, or else no one would care about their allocation. Their value is tied to human needs - from the most basic such as food or water, to the more abstract once we've satisfied those base needs, such as self-confidence or love.
Now, we can say that there are certain goods which meet these needs. These goods have value because they meet a need, and if they have substitutes. Food, as a concept, is very valuable as it meets a base need and cannot be substituted for. Wheat is also valuable, but less so than the overall concept of food as there are other things that can also slake our hunger.
So to review, there are resources in this world which directly satisfy a need. The value of this item varies widely based on the type of need, the consumer, and the ability to substitute. These resources can be said to have intrinsic value (which again varies widely, but is a property).
There are a second set of resources, which aid in the optimal allocation of the first set. This would include the concept of "money". It only exists to improve the ability for actors to optimally allocate these resources which have intrinsic value. They only have value as mechanisms in a specific economic solution - their value is not intrinsic as it does not satisfy a need. It is a specifically, socially generated solution. It has no intrinsic value.
TL;DR You can't eat bitcoin.

The only time people use irreversible payment methods for small vendors is in trustless situations (you're in front of me, the product is in between us, I pick it up and look at it, give you cash, we're both happy).

I think you've already realized where I'm going and are pouting.
So fiat money is in demand because it can be exchanged for other goods. It is a useful good solely because it can be exchanged for other useful goods - over time and space, and with stability.
This is distinct from goods like food, which directly satisfy some need.
How does this relate to our model of exchange value?

You do realize that this was the exact argument made regarding housing pre-2006ish, correct? That the price would always go up.

Debit is slower. You could serve two cash customers in the time it takes to serve one debit customer. Turnover, turnover, turnover. Twenty people in line behind you, more coming to the door deciding if the line is too long or not.
Hand cash, get change. Five seconds or less for a trained cashier. That's what you've gotta beat in terms of time.
Again - the decrease in transaction costs is too low to offset the increase in transaction times. And it requires completely new equipment, infrastructure, and training, all to serve an incredibly tiny market that if they want a coffee they'll pay with cash or debit anyways.

No, it is not quantifiable. It is not a number - it is a property.
Estimating it based on price inputs is an attempt to assign a price (a number) to a value (a property). The label is not the object.


Without scarcity, the assigned price is so low in relation to other numbers assigned to scarce objects we ignore it. Price is a combination of value and scarcity. There are scarce objects with no value.

But if it's bitcoin, then it's not an option at all. You're just fucked.
And it doesn't cost money to dispute or reverse a charge for me.
I like having the ability to chargeback - it's not about being careless, it's about the ability to not have to rigorously vet every single vendor I come across. And most of the time it's not about malice - sometimes it's about simple errors or bureaucracy. The simple fact that chargebacks exist keeps vendors honest and encourages them to resolve these issues quickly and on their own.

I know. And then we ran the math, showing one of two things:
1. Miners make no money, but transaction fees are reasonable.
2. Transaction fees are prohibitively high (on the order of $10+ per transaction), but miners stay in business.
The point is that block halving will destroy the profitability of miners, and transaction fees don't keep up. Unless of course, as in your scenario, billionaires literally donate their money to miners.

It allows donations to be tied to real, verified identities. These donations are then reported by the individual on their taxes.
The concern is not if it's falsifiable - the concern is if it's verifiable.
If a large percentage of a non-profits incoming funds are not able to be verified in this manner, the IRS doesn't just say "oh dear, not sure how to deal with this", they audit the fuck out of you. And if you can't say where the money came from, then get ready to get fucked.

Again, that's because public opinion polls don't mean shit and are irrelevant. What is relevant is the actions people take in our democratic structure over time. What is relevant is public opinion and discourse over the period of decades, not a small sample at a single point of time that a poll shows. What is relevant is the people who decide to run for public office, of all sizes from school boards to governor. What is relevant is the laws that are passed.

The problem is you are asking questions that have a discrete outcome (truth or falsehood) with no actual event that collapses it and allows resolution.
You can certainly get a prediction market to provide a probability distribution of "is climate change real". It's basically an opinion poll weighted by money. But what is your event that decides yes or no? There is no event, and there is no collapse. It's useless. It's a bad question that cannot be answered by this market in any real sense.
Contrast this with a question more suited to a prediction market - "Will sea levels rise 2cm in the next 10 years?". 
Prediction markets work well when they provide monetary incentive to accurately research a (somewhat) predictable and quantifiable problem. They are not a cure all.

It doesn't matter because the biggest factor to their profitability is number of customers, not transaction fees. 5 percent, ten percent, it doesn't matter if you can increase your customers by 30%. And the best way to increase number of customers is to speed up turnover time.
Bitcoin is irrelevant because the increase in transaction time kills their ability to move large numbers of customers during their rush times (mornings) which is when they make the bulk of their money.
They save 5% in transaction fees, but have a 500% increase in waiting time (10 seconds for cash, 1 min for bitcoin). They could have served five more customers in that time, making money on each of them. Instead they saved 5% on one customer. 
It loses them money. Bitcoin needs transaction time increases on par with their decrease in transaction fees. (ie 5% slower than cash) to be competitive. It's not even close.

There are a million ways to launder money, and it's even easier online with bitcoin. Tumblers are the most obvious option - but I could do things like set up a bunch of accounts on Cryptsy, buy up some shitty altcoin, offer to sell it at a ridiculous price - and then stolen money comes in and buys up these offers and now they're holding the coins. Scatter it everywhere, lather rinse repeat...
Look at Mt. Gox. Not a fucking peep about who actually stole the money. Hilarious really, and shows you that it isn't hard at all and the idea of a "self-regulating" community is nonsense when we don't even have the first clue about who pulled off the biggest theft in history.

It's actually math that makes banks secure as well - bitcoin does not have a monopoly on cutting edge cryptography.

Miners. Right now they're barely breaking even. As difficulty increases and the halving date approaches... it's not looking good.
Bitcoin right now is funded off miners getting new coins. Transaction costs won't even come close to filling the gap - so they're either going to make a lot less money, or there will be a lot less mining power out there.

And the lesson learned from those mistakes is: don't keep your money at centralized locations. Fine, except that keeping money at centralized locations significantly boosts the ability to spend and hence money velocity. You've then just moved the problem to personal security - which somehow is going to be more secure than a central location? It's like if I had $200,000 in cash - the real lesson is there's no secure place to store it.
What we've learned is: people steal money from everywhere. Insuring a certain level of cash for retail savers builds confidence in the economy.

Nope, not liable. This is why credit cards are great - they are essentially a contract between you and the bank for each purchase you make. You are only liable for contracts you complete, obviously.
If (and this is a big if) you wait long enough with fraudulent charges this could be considered acceptance, but seriously, if someone is stealing statements out of your mailbox then that's a clear mitigating factor.
Your link is irrelevant - identity theft encompasses a wide range of crimes. I'm talking about fraudulent charges on a credit card - which you are not liable for, period. If a bank bullies you into accepting them that's one thing, but the beauty of a credit card contract structure is that you clearly are not.
This is why I will only purchase online with an instrument like a credit card - because it isn't money! It's a contract which I later settle with money.

Someone got their bitcoins stolen? Well, they're clearly a fucking moron (which I'm not of course) and that's why it happened. It's not a problem with bitcoin, with users, with exchages, or whatever - because I'm part of that, and that would mean I'm at risk.
Empathy, in short, means admitting that it might happen to you. And a whole lot of bitcoiners really, really don't want to admit that. They haven't been stolen from because they're smart and perfect - not because they're a small target or lucky. That's too hard to think about.

You could then refer the IRS to your previous tax returns in which you declared the coins at market value as mining income or refer to the records at the exchange to determine an initial cost basis for the coins, then carry forward that loss as appropriate. If for some reason you thought it was appropriate to not keep records, you might be in a tough spot.

Why? Because fiat withdrawals are being limited, so people are buying up BTC in the hope that they can send it out, driving up the price.

Mined coins, for instance, can likely be written off as the cost of power and depreciation of equipment used to generate them.
Purchased coins can be written off at the cost basis of purchase (ie at whatever price you bought them at, max loss to be the amount of fiat transferred in).

Again - you need someone with enough volume to actual make real money. If you own 51% of the hash rate, you have an absurd amount of bitcoins in your possession that you need to offset. Then you need to borrow even more. You're crashing the entire bitcoin economy to make what, $10,000 in Bitfenix shorts? While destroying your own bitcoin portfolio?
Bitfenix short selling is for small fry. You'd need a gigantic sucker to let you borrow huge amounts of bitcoin (literally a significant fraction of all outstanding bitcoin).


If you can do this, you have stolen the bitcoins. Why go to all the trouble of an elaborate short-selling scam when you can just sell them on an exchange for cash or keep them?

It came from everyone. It's insurance. As a group, people have decided that they would rather pay a fraction of a percent (in the case of deposit insurance, probably a fraction of a tenth of a percent) in order to be able to reimburse people in the case of fraud or theft.

That's precisely what we're getting to.
Again - value is determined by demand. But there isn't one thing called "demand" - there are many different motivations for it. I demand food because I need to eat. Perhaps I may demand a tool such as a plow, as it will allow me to produce more food. The demand for art is driven by aesthetic appeal, and perhaps a desire for a store of value or investment potential.
So why do we demand money? Hint: think of the difference between societies that do not use money, and those that do.

Just distributed hashing power is needed. That's a function of the structure of the algorithm and the network, not the magnitude of the hashrate.

You are contributing nothing in terms of securing the network from a 51% attack unless you find a block. Even then, not much, and only at that time.

The monetary base is being expanded by payments to those who process transactions. That's a reward for service - an implied fee.
It's ironic that bitcoiners will call fiat inflation theft from all savers, but monetary base inflation in bitcoin is somehow completely different.

Exchange value, as you stated, is related to both scarcity and use value.
Fiat is scarce, with scarcity enforced by authority. The input cost of actually printing my own money is very cheap compared to what I could get for it, but if I try, I will be forcefully prevented from doing so. Fiat is also useful, as I can use it to purchase goods from other people that also use fiat money that I personally desire to satisfy my needs or wants.
Food is scarce, with this scarcity enforced by resource inputs (other useful goods like soil, or water). It has a use value that is conditional on it being able to slake your hunger.
Both are scarce good, but are scarce for very different reasons. Both are useful goods, but are useful for very different reasons.
But there is a parallel! What is it?

And you still don't see the problem with this?
Around 2034 it'll be 0.78125000 reward per block. In order for transaction fees to be comparable or greater than this reward, they need to be a minimum of 0.000186BTC (assuming 4200 transactions in a block).
At your valuation, this means each bitcoin transaction costs a little over $9.30 in 2034 dollars, or roughly $6.50-$7 in current dollars assuming similar inflation trends. And this is best case. It gets really ugly if you start assuming fewer transactions, or if you think miners should be making much more in transaction fees than the block reward in 2034.
The problem is simple: people make waaaaaaayyy too much right now mining. Transaction fees will not even come close to covering it in the future. And what cannot continue forever will stop.

For you to pay with BTC if you only have USD, you need to pay the spread.
For instance on Bitstamp, bid is $445.84 and ask is $447.88.
1. Suppose I want to pay the merchant $50. 
2. Working backwards, they would get that $50 by selling bitcoin at the bid price of $445.84 each (0.11214785 BTC). 
3. If I sent them that 0.11214785 BTC, I had to buy it at the ask of $447.88. 
4. 0.11214785 BTC therefore cost me $50.22.
So my cost from the bid/ask spread is about 0.44%. If I am working on a less liquid exchange, it will be more. If there is also a transaction charge for each trade (say 0.5%), my total costs are now at (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.44) = 1.44%. This is also assuming that you are not going through a payment processor who will also take a cut.

There's an economic incentive for miners to always ensure blocks are full so fee inflation begins. It isn't about other people willing to pay. Blocks will always be nearly full.
Imagine two mining pools who each control 50% of the hashrate. They can create a bunch of transactions with a fee "floor" to ensure that blocks are nearly full and fees spiral up. This doesn't actually cost the miners anything, since they're both equally likely to get all the fees back as part of the mined block.

Did you read the rest of the paragraph? That's precisely what I said - miners need congestion, so whatever the block limit is, we will hit it. They will make sure of that. It's not about "real" transaction volume, whatever that is.


No, that's the current ideology. It's software, not a holy decree carved in stone.
The important thing to realize is that miners have over-invested in hardware, block rewards are going down, and a crisis must be generated to increase fee revenue or else the whole thing goes to hell. We will always have full blocks because otherwise there's no incentive to attach a fee to your transaction, and any attempt to change this will be prevented by the miners because it's economically sensible.
The uncomfortable  solution is inflation in bitcoin, and I expect this to become a topic of conversation in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:51:31
No, it's the perfect definition of artificially expensive. We're running right against the 1MB block limit - a 2MB block would eliminate these congestion issues entirely, and unfortunately crater fee income as well. Hell, a 1.25MB block would do the same, and result in zero actual impact to network load. But very soon that won't be enough either - why?
The real problem is that mining hardware has been (over) built up on, surprise, block rewards which are going away slowly over time. And the miners are panicking, since they've invested an absurd amount of hardware into something that will disappear. There's also no incentive to actually pay a mining fee unless the network is broken (ie the current block is full), so the miners must push it to that state always.
There are two options: perpetual bitcoin inflation (ie no more halving) which is the most sustainable approach from a functional perspective but is ideologically unacceptable, or the hilariously insane approach we're getting now of always having full blocks to generate fees.
Run the  numbers: miners will not make the money they were making before the halving a few years from now without a ridiculous increase in fees per transaction, or a ridiculous increase in transactions assuming fees remain the same - which isn't happening. So here we are.
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:55:28
The problem is that the wallets are vulnerable to sophisticated statistical attacks. What people think is secure - what you think is secure - is often very vulnerable.
It isn't about having a unique password at all. It's about having a password that doesn't match the typical statistical parameters that people generating unique phrases often match up with - which is a very difficult task.
Again - you're calling people idiots to persuade yourself you're secure. Easy to pretend your passwords are perfect and everyone else is an idiot when the problem is something else entirely.

And if you make it artificially expensive, people stop riding the bus.

We can slice and dice the concept of trust down to whatever tiny portion you feel applies perfectly to bitcoin, but the fact is that large players can (and do) have their financial transactions observed in near-real time by unknown and untrusted third parties. Smaller parties are literally only secure by obscurity.
This makes many uncomfortable, as it is in general contrast to the underlying libertarian philosophies of bitcoin. Tell a libertarian "if you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide" and see how far that argument gets you. Similarly, tell them that a currency broadcasts their financial movements worldwide - and then ask them if that's a plus or a minus in their books.

No, it's bad for the economy in general since it prevent economic activity from happening that would have gone ahead otherwise. You're just thinking of idiots building second homes with gold plated toilets. It also stops things like new hospitals and roads being built. It causes people with useful skills that could be working to be unemployed since there's no money for them to be paid with.
You're suggesting that bitcoins have some "natural" value that would limit their usefulness as currency and make them unable to scale to large economies. They either scale to any value whatsoever, or they're useless.

Which would be economically sensible... miners pay enough to start fee inflation, they end up trading these fees among themselves so there's no real expense, and then reap the rewards from clients who need to pay inflated fees to get into the blocks.
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:13:27
An operator of a large mining pool commented on this - at current difficulty increases, it is sensible and rational from a his profitability perspective to go with the largest pool to decrease his variance.
So yes, block variability is high enough in relation to hashrate difficulty increase that it does matter what size pool you go with and you should go with the biggest one.

I'm not making any assumptions who's paying them, just that they exist. Someone is going to have to bite them though.
Merchants should always want to accept BTC if they can go BTC-&gt;USD at rates comparable to other payment methods and (very important) cost of implementation is cheap (ie can be amortized over the transactions to create an effective fee less than or comparable to other payment methods).
The problem is there's no incentive for consumers at all unless they already have lots of bitcoin. It's harder to use, costs more, and lacks consumer protection and third-party security. This feeds back to merchants, as the cost of implementation is therefore amortized over too few transactions and the effective fees are too high in the short term.

So you're arguing that a trustless payment model (bitcoin) needs to be used at trusted vendors in order to make sense?
Consumers love the ability to chargeback purchases and the lack of liability that come with a credit card for good reason. A single event of fraud, theft, or error in sending address with bitcoin can wipe out years of whatever 3% discount a vendor is offering.
It offloads payment risk from the vendor to the consumer. That's why vendors love it, and that's why consumers won't adopt it other than people who already have a bunch of bitcoin.

The point again is that if China decides to move to a gold-backed currency and peg it's currency to the price of gold, other countries control equivalent or larger amounts of gold.
And you're right, they couldn't buy national assets under sovereign control. So what can they do? Sell gold. And the Chinese are forced to buy it at the insanely inflated rates it takes to have gold back a modern economy. Since everyone else has so much of it, they couldn't just wait it out and outspend them - they'd have to unpeg the yuan. Gold would then rise against the yuan... sound familiar? This is what happened in the 70s to the US.
It's easy to destroy a countries economy if they have a gold backed currency because - once again - their modern economy as measured in loaves of bread, houses, factories, and barrels of oil exceeds the current market cap of gold by such a grotesque margin that the price of gold would need to be astronomical to reflect it.
And if it's astronomical - everyone else can just sell gold and take advantage of it, crashing your economy to shit since you're the only idiot forcing himself to buy at that astronomical level. Once that's done, you won't have much of a government to stop people from walking in and running the oil wells or whatever you were worried about before.

Bitcoin runs off hash rate. The people that control the hash rate have the most influence, because they provide 1) security to the network and by extension 2) can attack any other fork running off SHA256.

If the US government sets the price of gold to the arbitrary level required to backstop it's economic output, these private parties and international players can then sell gold at this arbitrary and very, very high level.
As such, the US government then gets to subsidize these private parties and international players to the tune of trillions of dollars until they manage to completely buy up all the gold - because after all, they can't set the price until they control the market.

Gold is already doing exactly what you're saying. It is priced at what the market values it as a monetary instrument - which is to say, a non-governmental monetary instrument. It's for private people to play around with, because the amount of money they have is so small in relation to the market cap of gold.
Again, it doesn't have the market cap to be a government monetary instrument. The value will not go up significantly because there would be a massive redistribution of wealth from existing government to gold producing countries - that's the problem. Governments are not going to spend trillions of dollars to throw the geopolitical balance of the world around with zero benefit to themselves.
It's like people saying "bitcoin will go to $1,000,000"! No it won't, because then Satoshi would be the wealthiest man in the world. And the only people who can make bitcoin go to $1,000,000 are the wealthiest people in the world, so why the fuck would they demote themselves in the power structure?

Interesting things happened with gold ten years ago, you're late to the party.
Look at what happened with oil - the price shoots up, alternate producers are now profitable after a few years of investment (fracking in the US), supply increases, existing producers (Saudis) freak and realize they've fucked themselves with high prices, so they willingly watch the price crash down so these alternate supply lines go offline.

I spike your hashrate for 2 weeks straight, I get the vast majority of the mining rewards, then leave. Your hashrate goes down by 75%. Confirmation times quadruple. The network becomes effectively unusable. I dump my coins, love that volatility. I do this every month until consensus is that it's better to be with the big boys than a shitcoin that is running off a bunch of hot air and no hardware.
Coins have died in exactly this way.
This is what bitcoin is about. It is fundamentally about hash power consensus. Everything else is just blather.

No, I don't. Because it's one of the largest bitcoin companies out there.
If it is literally the stupidest thing you could do, why is this company even running? Why is it so successful? Isn't it basically fraud at that point if it's so dumb?
It's like buying a car from a reputable dealership with high volume and ads on the radio, then having it blow up. Afterwards everyone says "oh yeah you shouldn't have bought that model, it blows up". Seriously? There's a reasonable expectation that a popular bitcoin company would be secure.

You don't need everyone to do this - look at OPEC. They don't produce all the oil in the world. A suitably large portion of miners can significantly influence the fee market by creating a fee floor.
It's a real issue because the cost to fill up blocks is relatively small compared to the resulting fee income that is bid up by so-called "smart" clients, plus you get back the percentage of all those fees based on how much of the market your cartel controls (75% with you, 75% rebate).
It's the only economically intelligent option for miners, which is why it's happening.

Again, you cannot prefer decentralization directly as a consumer preference.
It's why indie bands "sell out", and you have to go find new bands if you want to be super cool. You can't select a band directly, you always need to keep changing bands.
Your preference for decentralization cannot directly select a single actor, it instead must create constant change and crisis.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:03:24


Exactly, the only way to keep things "decentralized" is to constantly tear the system down and have it in a continual state of rebuilding. 
So you can have one of two things - stability, or decentralization.
A stable market will move toward centralization due to economies of scale - and precisely because of consumer preferences. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:17:45
No, the actors that actually do work decide. Exchanges, vendors, miners, and the people who use bitcoin regularly - just like any other economy. Running a node means effectively nothing.
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:05:33
But yet the market keeps giving them money, so they must be doing things right.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:28:44
Yeah, kind of like copper. Not exactly a currency.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:44:40
Of course it does. Again, the actual incremental cost of including these transactions is very small.
What you're discussing is increasing fees to encourage certain users and use cases, and limit others, that's it. It's not about cost at all.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:49:25
So pool our resources for a centralized solution?
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:12:28
Again, consumer preferences about decentralization don't matter.
The reason it doesn't matter is that capitalism will centralize a market over time due to economies of scale. Selecting an inefficient provider only delays the inevitable.
Like you said, the only way to change this is near-total disruption, and the cycle starts again. Good luck implementing disruptive change in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-31 18:50:00
Exactly. It's something like what, 40% of all internet traffic? And it makes zero money. It's a great service, but a shitty business.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:42:37


This is false.
Miners are making a profit - this means that bitcoin transactions are already priced above cost. If they weren't, miners would be losing money.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:38:27


Of course they can't have it, unless everyone starts implementing their consumer preferences at random every time.
Implementing your consumer preferences, having successful players grow, reaping the benefits of economy of scale... ooops we're centralized again.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:03:31
Consumers can prefer decentralization, but again, consumer preferences don't matter. Economy of scale matters - that's what drives markets monopolies. 
Can you show me markets which have remained decentralized? Where economy of scale does not apply?
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:11:27


Again, it's impossible to have a consumer preference for decentralization in capitalism. It's a result, not a quality to be selected for.


Nope, someone would just figure out how to exploit the new POW at scale eventually, and centralization begins anew. Then you have to POW change as a community if that's your consumer preference. Again, you can't select directly for it, it's a result.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:37:29
Preference in the market doesn't matter, or else we wouldn't be having this discussion. Bitcoin would be decentralized since there's clear consumer preference for it.
As markets mature they become centralized due to economies of scale. You can prefer a decentralized market, but the only way to obtain that is periodic crisis and reinvention, not simple preference.
You've realized that the only choice is reinvention - a POW change. Interesting to see how it shakes out. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:31:21
The issue isn't that mangos cause cancer, the issue is that you hate mango centralization and want to buy mangos from the little guy like you used to.
I mean you can try that, you could go to farmers markets, buy from kids on the side of the road, all that stuff. But if mangos are truly a fungible commodity, then you're just paying more for the same thing. You're being inefficient. And you know it. So you're protesting by wasting money, great - this would be retail scale SHA256 mining in the case of bitcoin.
The problem here is that it's the same mango. It doesn't cause cancer. You just don't like the fact that the mango producer is large and centralized. It's a result of the market, not a preference to be selected for. If you really don't like it, stop eating mangos, and pick another fruit - another POW in this case. 
But you can't say you're still eating mangos. You can bring along all your buddies, you can even call everyone the mango club like you used it, who cares. But change is the only way you can decentralize.

Monopoly is a natural result of economy of scale. It requires no government enforcement.

Done and done.

I'm simply stating that it's not reflective of any actual real input costs of running the network. It's artificial scarcity, it's regulation, it's fees and tariffs, it's rent-seeking.

@_date: 2017-03-30 21:18:52
Again, you can't have a consumer preference for decentralization.
You can say fuck Jihan, but who/what are you going to pick instead? Whatever you pick, it's likely that a bunch of other people who think like you are going to do the same thing... and it grows... and capitalism allocates resources to the most efficient... and they become the new monopoly. 
Centralization is a result of consumer preferences! You can't prefer decentralization because that's choosing everyone, and you have to choose someone.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:51:45


There you go, that's what I'm saying. There's no way to decentralize bitcoin other than periodic crisis and reinvention - you can't have a consistent technical solution, because as time progresses economies of scale will always drive it toward centralization.

USB 3.0 - maximum of 900 mA from a port @ 5VDC = 4.5W
High efficiency miner (ie Antminer S9 = 0.1J/GH)
watt = joule*second
Insanely optimistic best case, a USB 3.0 miner at this idealized efficiency pulling full power:
(4.5 J/S)/(0.1 J/GH) = 45GH/s is our fantasy USB miner
Current hash rate = 4,000,000 TH/s
Our miner = 0.00000113% of total current hash rate
We must sell 59,259,260, or slightly under sixty million, of these non-existent idealized USB miners to hit 50% hashrate.

Again, consumer preferences don't matter for fungible commodities - which Bitcoin is. I can't sell you a locally mined small batch artisan bitcoin. 
You need to explicitly violate fungibility - like conflict free diamonds and their intensive chain of custody documentation requirements.  


For fungible commodities yes, you're just pissing away money. Go buy some small scale mining equipment if you think otherwise. You would need to fork bitcoin to successfully do this, and fork it again when centralization occurs once more, and so on, and so on.

There are long lasting monopolies in unregulated markets as a function of economies of scale. That's capitalism for you.
Can you compete with large scale gold mining? Will large gold  mining companies have to sell their equipment to you to remain profitable? 
The only way to compete with these large players is to have enough money to buy as much, or more, sophisticated equipment and the labor to run it. This is economy of scale in capitalism.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:25:55
Yeah, by the people who use it and run it. Spinning up random nodes that aren't actually involved in the bitcoin economy means nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:19:31
Just purchase any miner, it's a space heater that also produces BTC. You don't need anything special.
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:59:58
But that's my precise point - you have to tear it down periodically to get decentralization. And tearing down bitcoin at this point will have interesting consequences.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:31:49
The problem is that centralization and monopoly is what happens in a successful unregulated market. 
Welcome to capitalism, this is the end game. You can't beat this with changing the POW - that's a technical "solution" to the real social and political problem which is that monopoly is a long-term consequence of the economic system Bitcoin operates under.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:47:47
It doesn't matter what that consumer thinks in unregulated capitalism. It ends up in monopoly or with a few major semi-identical players. That's the most efficient economic result, so that's what's going to happen.
This isn't a problem with bitcoin. It's a problem with capitalism. You can't fix it by arguing or by technical solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:43:36
The problem is that no one who is actually doing useful things with bitcoin cares - so it's ignored. You can spin up as many nodes as you want with crazy rules, what matters is what the people actually using it and doing useful things with it are running.
Everyone in my neighborhood can put up a sign on their front lawn saying "VISA NOT ACCEPTED" and no one gives a shit because no one wants to buy anything from them with VISA anyways. But if Walmart stops accepting VISA - then people pay attention.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:04:36
That's just an altcoin at this point. Changing POW would be catastrophic to bitcoin and it's hilarious that it's even being considered.
The entire point of Litecoin was ASIC resistance... look at how well that worked out. Any coin that becomes sufficiently popular will become centralized. Welcome to capitalism.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:11:08
There's no "going against" anything. There is no voting. The only nodes that matter are the ones where transactions flow through.
It's like you putting a sign in your front yard "VISA NOT ACCEPTED". No one cares because no one wants to buy something from you with VISA anyways.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:13:15


Sure, and as markets matured each became steadily less decentralized. This is my point - you can have a technology disrupt a market, but as it matures, economies of scale will always drive it toward monopoly. This is capitalism.
It will never remain decentralized. That's the point, that's capitalism, that's economy of scale. These new markets will not be one million tiny one-man companies - it'll be ten 100,000 people companies because that's more efficient. You can't avoid centralization in capitalism.

In a collapse scenario no one is going to pay anyone with gold. You're going to barter with useful goods.
And when society re-emerges, it's not like people are going to forget about fiat. Gold is for when the financial system panics. It relies on it still being there.

Then either everyone will die, or there will be enough for society to re-emerge in a strange vision of what everyone remembers before.
There will not be a magic period of 30 years or so where we all run around with swords and live in castles and use gold and save princesses. We will not relive our own history. We will use the knowledge we had before to build a new future, and it will look nothing like the past.
@_date: 2016-06-03 02:57:39

It's very unclear what you're bringing to the table.
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:30:24
Let me get this straight - a completely new algorithm, able to be implemented by anyone on consumer hardware, is more secure than existing SHA256 hardware?
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:43:06
Sure, but don't be upset when there's no one to actually do the work on your new project.
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:41:58
Everyone can be replaced, the point is what resources you bring to the table. Massive SHA256 hash power will be put to work.
A random proposal for a new algo... great. Bitcoin has nearly a decade of dedicated hardware development toward securing the network. You're suggesting going back to CPU/GPU and opening yourself up to getting dominated by a botnet?
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:56:38
The only insecurity here is the people attempting to fork. The network itself is quite sturdy.

Money in the future is worth less than money right now.
If I have money right now, I can choose to do anything with it - including just holding on to it and doing nothing. Or I could invest it. Or I could buy that tasty coffee I've been craving. Point is, I have choices and can pick the best one for me. 
If you give me this ridiculous locked up money, you're making that choice for me. So I would demand a premium for this inconvenience, in the form of a return on my investment. This return would depend on the risk of the investment and the duration of the lockup.
Only a moron would accept one bitcoin locked up for 20 years over one unlocked bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:56:15
And again, being paid in bitcoin that is locked up for a number of years is worse than being paid in regular bitcoin.
This is literally the fundamental basis of investment in our economy - if you choose to exchange a liquid currency for a less liquid investment, you should be compensated with a premium, or else you're just throwing money away.
No sensible person would select this option unless there was a premium paid, and who is chipping in this premium?
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:05:04

Which pays a significant premium, about 6% a year after inflation.
For a 20 year contract assuming 6% return and inflation at 2%, you would need to pay me ~4.7 times a regular fare in order to be worthwhile.
The entire point of putting your money somewhere where it cannot be accessed is that you demand a corresponding return in the future for this lack of liquidity.

This is just cheap hardware not bothering to implement proper software solutions that already exist and have no additional hardware cost associated with them.

Now? Of course, they're useless. Toy numbers to push around.
But in 2013? There was a very real thought that this was an idea that could kill it. Distribute subsidized hardware, use client power, share the mining profits. Only problem was that hashpower took off and low power mining, even with a huge userbase, didn't scale.
So now they've got a useless mining chip attached to a bunch of fringe business cases in an attempt to get a product, any product out the door.

21 Inc relies on &lt;100W power profiles (and &lt;10W ideally) generating meaningful amounts of bitcoin across it's user base. These days are gone, and it's only going to get worse. The difference here is that hardware progression is working against 21 Inc's business model, not for it.


Raspberry Pi loaded with 21 Inc software, preloaded with purchased bitcoin. You will get more bitcoin buying it versus the cost of manufacturing a low power mining chip. 
Hell, if you really wanted the "income stream" model, just send out dust to each subscriber like the bitcoin faucets of old. Still cheaper than mining chips.

The dangerous part about this is that it is basically implementing government seizure of assets in the Bitcoin community. An elite governing group (in this case Bitcoin developers) decides that certain assets are "unsafe" and as such must be destroyed for the greater good.
It's pure bitcoin socialism and goes precisely against the libertarian ideals it was founded upon. Many libertarians would say if you want to knowingly store millions of dollars in an insecure location or in an insecure way, it's your own problem when it gets stolen.

It was made to mine profitably. That was the entire point. It took them too long to deploy the hardware, and now they need to make up random use cases for it now that the primary design role has become obsolete.
The entire premise of 21 and co was distributed mining, subsidized hardware, client pays power, split revenue. Except it took them way too long to deploy, hashpower went through the roof, and now they've got outdated hardware and no business model.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:40:28

Literally everything they're doing can be done better in software and existing hardware. The only reason to include a mining chip is to create useful amounts of bitcoin, and it would have made money if they launched on schedule. But they didn't.
Go back and re-read every single bit of 21 and co promotional material through the lens of the mining chip actually making money. It's a great idea. The problem is that hashpower has spiked and you can't make appreciable amount of bitcoin from the power they were planning on siphoning anymore.

Demurrage is an incentive to spend, that's a completely distinct concept.

He could just use blockchain records or any other documentation, and if he really couldn't account for where it came from, he should be prepared to have a really tough time cashing out regardless (plus the hell that tax time is going to be). That scenario also doesn't line up with millions of dollars in transactions and hundreds of thousands cashed out in the last three years.

Because the logical approach if you have a deflationary currency is to sell everything you own, purchase this currency, then hide somewhere spending as little as possible and wait for the currency to appreciate, and re-emerge when deflation wanes where you can buy back everything you sold for less money.
It encourages investment in the currency instead of in the actual economy.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:56:04
So millions in transactions and hundreds of thousands withdrawn as an "investment"? Are you a day trader? A miner? A sexy cam girl? A dark net coke dealer? That guy who delivered the 10,000 BTC pizza back in the day?
Saying its an "investment" is pretty damn vague, particularly given that it looks like your account is being shut down due to the transfers being flagged as suspicious by Kraken's bank.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:38:10
It's directly related to why his account was shut down or locked. Kraken must comply with criminal investigations and money laundering regulations. As a client you can choose to assist them in that process with full and honest disclosure assuming that you're on the up and up, or clam up and get a lawyer if you'd prefer to limit the information you give them - in which case you can't complain if they choose to cease doing business with you.
Frankly he's lucky that they're giving him an out to withdraw in bitcoin, versus just locking his account while the bank AML specialists go over his transactions for the last few years with a fine toothed comb.

If everyone switches over to mining, it's still a less efficient use of resources. It's much worse for the economy overall as useful, economic natural gas would go unused.
That's the entire point - mining is designed to be wasteful.

The government of the United States of America, assuming you are talking about US dollars.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:04:26
The difference is that US dollars represent a debt owed by the US government (ie ultimately backed by the ability to pay US taxes)- bitcoin represents nothing. (ie backed only by market consensus value). 
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:51:44
No, it represents an owed debt (ie credit) for everyone. Whether you choose to redeem it with the issuer or trade with a third party is up to you.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:05:03
For example:


This is called a "wash trade" and is illegal in regular stock trading. Bitcoin is open to manipulation tactics that have been outlawed in the US stock markets since the Great Depression.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:56:18
All debt has conditions. Doesn't mean it isn't debt.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:36:12
For one it allows them to cast off old obligations like those pesky non-voting shareholders who they screwed over.






@_date: 2015-04-16 16:57:26
Accepting US dollars, despite being legally unable to redeem them (which is what they represent) is your choice.
They do not represent a redeemable debt for you, but that does not change the fact that they are a redeemable note for a US citizen - hence the reference to money representing debt.
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:21:48
Fiat is backed by debt - effectively, fiat is debt. Cash notes represent a certain amount of debt - ie liability.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:13:28
The debt is issued by the US government, and they are the ones who place conditions on it. They say "redeemable for tax credit with us", in a basic sense. 
If you buy a gift certificate at a store, this is a debt owed to you by the store in a sense. If you want unicorns from the store, and the store doesn't have unicorns - it's still a debt. The only thing you can redeem that gift certificate for are items in the store. The only thing you can redeem US dollars for with the US government is tax credit (in a general sense).
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:58:20
So you can't redeem this cash note (which represents debt owed by the US government) with the US government yourself. 
This doesn't change the fact that the cash note represents a debt owed by the US government. You're ineligible to actually collect on this debt. Doesn't change the fact that's it's debt. 
Seems foolish to actually accept these dollars in trade then, except for the fact that other people want them so they're still useful.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:24:06
You're mixing up the direction of liability here.
The US government is in debt to you, and will only settle with you via tax credit. That's what your cash represents.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:47:32
You chose to accept US dollars in trade with a third party presumably.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:13:27
Roughly 50% of Bitcoin Cash, where enough hash power could break off to attack BTC while allowing sufficient defense to remain.
You only need to be half as strong as your best opponent - that's the beautiful thing. But instead we waste energy for nothing.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:22:52
So again, US dollars are useless to you unless you can trade someone else for them. Same way that if you had a gift certificate for a store you hate, it's useless to you unless you can trade it to someone else who wants it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:42:41
The point is that miners are a finite resource that can be estimated and projected. It is only necessary to have 50% of the projected near term hash power of your strongest competitor. Instead, Bitcoin wastes power for nothing.
I can throw ten billion dollars at this, but there is only so much mining hardware in inventory and so much in the pipeline.
Just buy half as much hardware via long term contracts as your best competitor - you're protected. There are only so many people making SHA256 chips at economic fab scale.
This is a mature technology at this point. The market is known. If a crazy attacker tried to buy out the market they'd be easily noticed, it's like someone trying to corner ball bearings or some other commodity.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:19:31
They're exactly the same thing.
The US government must give you tax credit for them. US citizens must legally accept them as settlement for financial obligations. Cash represents debt to the US government, and there are legal structures surrounding this.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:33:28
The US government promises to give tax credit in exchange for dollars. It's a debt.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:30:31
People pay their power bill in fiat, and everyone's centralizing to roughly the same amount of GH/$.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:59:19
You're holding notes that allow a US citizen to redeem them for tax credit. You chose to accept them - they're still debt. The conditions of the debt exclude you from claiming it.


They're a debt you can't claim. That doesn't change the fact that they are notes issued as conditional debt owed by the US government.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:26:21
They are a debt.
This is literally the definition of fiat money.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:28:15
Again, the US government is in debt to you, and will only settle via tax credit.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:29:22
A large amount of miners at the same cost margin is a huge problem. They all go offline at the same time, confirmation times go up, difficulty resets, they all jump back on, lather rinse repeat. The resulting variance in block confirmation times is a huge pain in the ass if you're actually using the network.
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:51:11
500 largest corporations and governments produce 50 different proposals of which 20 actually get off the ground and then consolidate into 2-3 popular blockchains.

They are obligated to accept them as settlement for any financial debt. That's the definition of legal tender.
@_date: 2015-04-16 14:55:12
Then US dollars are useless to you, unless you can find another person who wants them.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:10:01
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:17:18
You can't redeem the debt based on legal conditions placed on the debt at time of issue. You chose to accept this note despite that. It still represents debt owed by the US government.
If you can't redeem a Wal-Mart gift card because there's no Wal-Marts near you, that doesn't change the fact that a Wal-Mart gift card represents a debt owed, given certain conditions on the manner of settlement, to the bearer of that card. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:43:18
The point is if you're willing to trust, a third party single ledger is an obviously superior system from every angle.
This means that the entire point of a blockchain is moot - all you care about is the deflationary characteristics. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:33:35
The problem is when a large amount of miners exist at the same cost margin. It only works with a smooth distribution of marginal costs.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:17:15
I don't care about the network. I either care about sending or receiving money and 51% attacks are irrelevant in that case. It either works or it doesn't. Maybe I join in the 51% attack. Maybe I don't.
The point is, you trust nothing by design.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:13:02
Which is a major weakness and goes against the entire point of the protocol, which is relying on cryptographic proof and not trust.
We can't have it both ways - when coins are stolen from a poorly secured or malicious wallet, it's never Bitcoin's fault, it's the wallet devs, or the user's actions, or whatever. An exchange is hacked, never should have stored coins on there.
But now you're telling me that trust in a wallet is a fundamental part of Bitcoin? Why shouldn't I just trust an exchange in the same way?
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:27:00
I trust you.
@_date: 2016-10-28 23:57:31
Well, except for the fact that the network failed at moving coins quickly and cheaply for a day or so. Of course the entire system didn't collapse, but it's certainly not ideal performance.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:00:34


Well maybe you owe taxes to the US. Would be useful then. If you don't, maybe you can trade it to someone who does.
It's still debt owed by the US government.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:59:38
Ask the people who had their coins stolen from malicious wallets if they'll trust software blindly again.
And no, you don't trust the miners. The only thing that matters is the consensus they generate as a group.
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:28:51


Again, all the people who lost coins to malicious wallets realise now that trusting code blindly is a mistake and not something bitcoin fundamentally relies on - in the same way trusting an exchange to hold your coins is a mistake.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:21:15
Sending or receiving money successfully without trust obviously. Again, a 51% attack is irrelevant and it's just network consensus cheerleading. You're missing the point of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:59:38
No, the debt has clear legal conditions attached to it. US citizens may redeem it with the US government for tax credit.
It's up to you as a foreign national if you want to accept these notes in trade. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:15:22
Precisely, and that's why Bitcoin has become internet beanie babies instead of an actual payment system. Designed to be trustless, and is significantly less efficient than a trusted system as a result. Unfortunately, it can't actually work as a product without trust. If it didn't go up in value it would have no use case.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:28:52
Credit and debit card fraud, this does not apply to bank transfers/etc. Steal CC info, buy bitcoin, non-reversible with no paper trail and now the bank/account owner bites the losses with no ability to recover.
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:58:14
If transaction volume remains consistently above block capacity then transaction fees will bid upward without limit as there is no price equilibrium to guarentee entry into a block.
How do you fit 11 people in 10 spots? You don't, no matter how much the 11th person bids.
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:14:08
There's only so much space in a block. Not everyone can get in. It's not a "pay this amount and move your coins" situation. If transaction volume continues to increase, then transaction fees can spiral upwards and you still won't be guaranteed a spot.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:41:37
Bitcoin is a trustless system. By definition, by design. If you want a trusted ledger, go to a bank.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:35:55
The entire point is that it isn't trustable, that it doesn't rely on trust. If you want a trustable financial system, lend money to Ned Flanders with a promise to pay it back or something.
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:27:53
They'll attempt recovery from the merchant and/or the client depending on the liability they determine. 
Regardless, it's a giant pain in the ass (in terms of both time and money) particularly if it ends up that the client leaked their CC details or isn't being entirely honest about how the crypto charges got on to their card.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:08:29
Bitcoin has a beautifully executed distributed ledger that doesn't rely on trust, but on cryptographic proof.
Its monetary policy however is still set by the majority of hash power and the users that follow. This is trust in its purest form unfortunately - that those who agree with you now will continue to agree with you in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:57:16
The point is if you trust anything you're not following the model.
You can write your own client from scratch off the white paper, trust no one, and actively try to fuck over others. You can hope that they trust you, but that's irrelevant. Trust doesn't matter. Your transactions will be forwarded if they are deemed cryptographically valid by others, not if they trust you.
Trust actively gets you into trouble - see people who download wallets without auditing them, people who leave their coins on exchanges, etc.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:41:13


You're trusting a central authority to maintain and issue code, and issue trustworthy wallets as you previously stated. Not so much a revolution as a new boss.


That's not true at all. A blockchain based currency can set the pace/algorithm of how coins are issued to whatever it wants, and be deflationary or inflationary as a result. Totally decoupled from the fact that it's a crypto based third party ledger.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:35:01
Last bear run was 2-3 years long - takes a long time for retail to get beaten up, forget about it, then jump back in. 
I'd say a few months prior to the 2020 halving would be a good time to start averaging back in, when miners start to pump the price up or fail miserably due to lack of income.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:27:00
Sure, but that's the difference between a product and a protocol, and highlights the major weakness in a supposedly secure system.
Literally the entire Bitcoin protocol is built upon lack of trust, and is incredibly inefficient versus a trusted approach (ie a single third party trusted ledger). Then, in order to actually have mass use... you need to trust a single third party wallet. Bit of cognitive dissonance.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:25:28
No, you can implement code based on the whitepaper/existing spec and create your own transactions.


The moderators of this sub don't trust the majority of miners, and yet here we are.
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:18:31
The only reason it wasn't a problem is because volume went back down. If volume stayed high, a bidding spiral would erupt.

RFC 2549 would be a good start depending on your climate.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:18:10
The bank is responsible for the transfer in that case. A fraud investigation is much, much easier. All documentation is already there, and it is of high quality and first hand. The wire transfer is also generally non-reversible, and is not immediately refunded unlike a credit card which is explicitly protected against fraud due to its contractual structure (you aren't buying things on a credit card, you're signing a contract each time promising to pay the bank who's buying things - a third party can't enter into contracts for you).
If a third party account using a bank CC is compromised/transaction reported as fraudulent, it is much more difficult to determine if an actual crime has occurred or if someone is just trying to do a chargeback because the value of their bitcoins dropped by over half in a few months. The fact that a CC is reversible adds a huge layer of complexity, legal and otherwise.
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:21:29
So you're saying it will exceed a floor of approximately $100, the previous low prior to the last bubble? A strong endorsement.

Increased power consumption via increased hash power does not produce additional benefit to the end user - it's not faster, it's not cheaper. It is a contest to see who can waste the most.

The conditions on collecting the debt are explicit, you must be a US citizen. You must also accept only tax credit.
The problem is that you are unable to meet those conditions. But that is your problem, not the US government's as no one forced you to accept US dollars. 
You accepted a note that you are unable to collect on, and the only usefulness you have for it is for trade.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:48:55
Bitcoin is a trustless distributed ledger. It requires no trust. It actively assumes people will not trust each other.
@_date: 2016-10-29 19:49:14
What I'm saying is that with further transaction growth a point will be hit where wallets who auto-set fees will cause a bidding war to erupt. There is no equilibrium other than some transactions being left out.
Like I said, if a bus leaves every hour and holds 10 people, and 11 people show up every hour - everyone can bid rationally, but if everyone wants to get on the bus, there is no equilibrium.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:08:17
It filters a list of addresses reused by an individual or organization.
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:13:59
They are not acting to implement these systems in trusted private networks.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:17:28


This is what banks already do. They run private ledgers only accessible to partners. The entire point of a blockchain is that it is untrusted and public - if you're trusted and private, just use a ledger.
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:30:45
No, I am not. The only way for an equilibrium to be reached is for desired transaction volume to equal actual transaction volume or less over time. This is trivial.
If 11 people want to occupy 10 spaces in a bus, they can bid for access. One person is left behind. If the next bus has ten spaces and 11 people show up again, 12 people bid for access and two are left behind. Repeat with a steadily growing queue of people left behind unless new people stop showing up.
The only way everyone gets on the bus is if passenger volume goes down, or people give up and choose another mode of transportation.
@_date: 2015-03-14 14:47:13
Transaction sizes and frequencies as a distribution would be distinctive between the three.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:52:24
The blockchain is an inefficient and expensive way of verifying this.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:57:09


Literally every bubble has had a corresponding crash where price has gone down 80%+ percent.
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:28:58
I'm not saying it's wrong or right, I'm stating the consequences. If transaction volume consistently remains above capacity, a bidding spiral will erupt. The only way to reach equilibrium is for transactions to give up and leave the system.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:44:16


Again, they're trusted and private. A blockchain adds complexity, costs, and is slower. The only reason to use it is if you don't trust everyone, and it's public.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:05:51
I use the definition of trust in the whitepaper. I "trust" that over the dictionary.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:12:25
What quantifiable characteristic of the transaction makes it spam? Like you said, the source or destination is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:42:56


No they don't. They are the middle men, they run the ledgers.
A blockchain is only useful in situations where people don't trust each other and anyone can add transactions. In every other situation a simple database or ledger is cheaper, faster, and better in every way.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:48:49


And simultaneously bitcoin is the currency of the future that anyone can use if they try to learn a bit about it, right?
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:32:43
"Shouldn't"? What are you basing that on? They do. An exchange has a distinct profile of transactions. A miner has a distinct profile of transactions. A customer of say, Circle, has a distinct profile of transactions.
I profile the transactions, I profile the user.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:21:55
Filtering transaction types can certainly target individuals or organizations. The end result is the same, despite differences in implementation.
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:36:18
It wouldn't track arbitrarily closely, it would be this crazy weird mix of 1 year duration futures that are constantly expiring and being re-bought. To be honest I'm not sure how it would look, but it wouldn't be spot price because there would be a bunch of contracts in there with significant time value left (and this average duration would likely be constantly changing).
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:50:26
Certain individuals or organizations can have consistent transaction characteristics. Filter those characteristics, filter the organizations and individuals.
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:53:53
Your list is a list of individuals or organizations. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:57:13

@_date: 2015-03-13 19:39:21
So we should be able to filter transactions by ignoring the identity of the source/destination then, and simply analyzing the properties of the transaction in isolation, correct?
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:41:06
Yeah, and ripple is really taking off, isn't it?
@_date: 2016-05-28 19:07:24
You said cheerio, story checks out.
@_date: 2015-10-02 01:03:32
... and this period is still much more volatile than major currencies.
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:39:43
We do not see stability on par with major currencies. BTC moved in about a 3% range last week and that's a "stable" week. That would be a huge move for any real currency.
@_date: 2015-10-01 22:22:41
Yeah, if you say the last nine months, and remove the major peaks and troughs, and smooth the rest out a bit, then kind of squint a bit, it looks great.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:34:31
But that's a filter based on a re-used address you have correlated with an individual or person who you view to be engaging in spam, not a characteristic of the transaction itself.
Again, are you able to quantifiably determine if a transaction is spam without reference to source or destination address? Could I give you a list of transactions with censored sources and destinations, and can you classify them as spam/not-spam?
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:40:36
Any time period where average transaction demand over the long term exceeds block capacity. The only way the status quo works is if transaction volume doesn't continue to grow.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:19:40
That's just restating your definition of spam. What quantifiable characteristic of the transaction enables you to determine "purpose"?
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:16:16
Care to tell me how I get my bitcoins out then?
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:21:06
No one has successful got their cash/coins out yet. No emails have gone out to clients. No plan is in place to return these assets other than a "trust me we're solvent, update your BTC addresses and we'll return it sometime".
The only facts right now are that trading and withdrawals are frozen and no one knows what is really going on with their assets. Everything is very much still up in the air.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:11:53
Cashed out via what method? And after the announcement went up (ie 1PM EST or so yesterday)? And you actually have cash in hand or money in account, and haven't just started the process?
Bitcoin withdrawals are locked. The trading spread sucks, I have zero desire to automatically lose money and then start a cash withdrawal process that has no known clearing time or established success rate.

Bitcoin is proven to be efficient and effective in transferring value between actors who do not trust each other.
If you trust each other (ie different offices of the same company) you can use simple internal ledgers to "transfer" value much quicker, cheaper, and easier.
This is why Western Union/Walmart/etc money transfer business is more efficient than bitcoin - because they trust each endpoint and they're all on the same accounting system. The costs come from regulatory compliance and having employees and real offices, not any actual cost of moving money.
