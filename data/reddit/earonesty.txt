Yeah, but all the exchange has to do is route the order, and verify the transactions.   Since the funds are locked there's no risk of the buyer "changing their mind" ... the exchange would never sign something that back out of a transaction.   The counterparty is holding on to a transaction that allows them to settle (obtain ownership of the USDT/BTC or whatever) at any time up until the locktime expires.

It is not rediculous.   Add up ALL the "hacks" of exchanges.   
Now compare that to ALL the bank deposit failures over the last 10 years - more than 8% of all deposits ....
Have more than 8% of all bitcoins been stolen?  No f'ing way.
And that doesn't count all of the *uninsured* losses people have to deal with in the finance industry, which is about 2% *per year*.
The reason you *see* more Bitcoin hacks is because the news REPORTS them more not because there ARE more.   Did you know there was $10 mil stolen from SWIFT this *week* ... no because it's a fucking footnote in an NYT article that got NO PRESS.
Now the numbers might be close.   You might want to claim that Gox was "hacked".   And it wasn't unpreventable fraud.  Whatever.
Or you can compare to credit cards ... that's it you've completely lost.  Because credit card fraud, even divided by total credit card balances... completely kills bitcoins losses.   Hundreds of billions lost.   All those fees merchants pay... 0.5% is paid out by visa in losses, and another 2% on top is lost by merchants on average.   That's over 2.5% of total transactions ... in fraud.   Ever read a news article on it?  You won't.   
Just because hundreds of billions are lost globally to credit and bank related identity theft each year... doesn't make it news.
Bitcoin is news.  Everything else is goatshit.

There is no legal difference between Bitfinex losing bitcoin and some gold stock losing it's gold in a vault heist.    (That seems to happen to all of them).
But, Berni Madoff robbed 18 billion dollars from investors, and no one noticed for years.   Bitfinex screwed up and *people at reddit seemingly knew what happened before Bitfinex did* because of the p2sh monitoring.   
So, Bitcoin wins.  It's better at transparency and better at dealing with these situations.   
Bitfinex spreading losses on shared holdings has the best legal precedent.   Which is why they did it.   There clearly was no true segregation of accounts.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:28:27
Downside is that the exchange will *have* to shut down and reopen channels every time period.  Resulting in losses due to fees.    It could get expensive.   Even if you set the channel to be locked for 24 hours, that would mean say, 15 cents a day per trading account.   Not sure if people would want to pay $60/year in fees just to trade.   But I guess the exchange could eat the costs in exchange for it's clearance fees.   Smaller accounts would probably not be viable like they are today.  I could see this being the de-facto standard for larger and more active accounts though.

they only need to sign off at the time of the trade for the maximum loss (total value of trade or more if it's margin/optioned).   if you're sitting on coin... not in the middle of a trade... you don't need to sign anything.      you can do this with a microchannel... where the coin is time locked, that way you can settle every 24 hours or as otherwise needed.   the farther out you settle, the more risk there is... but still ... i'll bet you anything that 90% of that 95mil was just sitting there.... not actively trading on the exchange (indeed bitfinex volume is high... but not that high, and much of the volume generated by few accounts).     and exchange should NEVER have access to "resting" coin.   And they should ONLY have a channel open with you for actively traded coins, with the width of the channel fixed to the maximum size of the trade.   Any exchange that does otherwise (read... all of them), is complete crap.

@_date: 2016-08-03 16:02:53
No: That doesn't require *both* private keys on a multisig.  That only requires ONE key... to prevent the user from moving their reserves out of the account until settlement.   Bitfinex just f'ed up.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:10:50
1 &amp; 2: I think you can make it so they don't have to be online.   When the trade goes in you pre-sign a send to "whoever".  The exhange doesn't actually give it out until the find the cross.
3.  90% of the users could give a crap about microseconds versus milliseconds.  The handful that do can expose themselves to risk and let the exchange hold funds.  Yay for them.
4.  Nah.   Shorts are trivial, they are just lends/sales, you lock up the lend the same way.  Margins are the same way... just require less locked up funds ( and the both the exchange and the user have to takes on more risk ).
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:41:10
Yeah, I would rather have someone poke a hole in the concept, or find a flaw in it... rather than click a button.   I think I could get a working exchange online, using channels, in a few months of work... and then I'd have hell promoting it... and dealing with garden-variety hackers, etc.   
I'd rather just have Shapeshift do it.

Payment channels can be used in exchanges instead: 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:58:56
If someone is buying and someone else is selling, I can tell the seller to send the buyer a locked transaction into the buyers channel, and vice versa.   IE: As an exchange operator, I can route orders so they flow directly into and out of the channels.   The exchange doesn't need to "put up funds" outside of the payment channels.   Assuming 100% of my orders cross, I have no need to maintain any "hot wallets", or steal-able funds.   All I do is route transactions... and secure the channels.   Customers are essentially trading with each other, with me as the middleman.   
Indeed, you can probably distribute the middleman via a P2P broadcast/routing scheme.    Actually, now that you've made me think about it, I see no reason not do distribute the hub except for speed/efficiency issues.   Anyone can run a hub (collect broadcast transactions, reply with best-match orders).   The market could then find the best hub operators.   Large players could use multiple hubs, etc.

Traders using exchanges have to deposit funds first.   They deposit to the channel, instead of to the exchange directly.   The channel requires *two* keys for trades to happen.   Traders have to sign transactions... every single one.   This is a variant on lightning network.

 - the DAO was not hacked and has nothing to do with bitcoin.   
 - any decentralized exchange can have errors/hacks etc.   but, because it must be transparent... it's less *likely* to be hacked/stolen from.    
 - you can't stop everything - you can make it less likely.   
 - centralized exchanges operate like this:  here company take my 600 million dollars, and try to feed yourself on the $500k per year i generate in fees.   im trusting you not to steal from the 600 mil.

The attacker would need the customer and exchange keys to hack a channel.  With only 1 key, funds cannot be moved - only protocol can be obeyed.   It's possible to trick a customer into thinking that their orders are not going through when they actually are... and other such tricks.   Probably you can do a "drain" attack on a customer, but it would be challenging at best.   I can't imagine how you'd pull it off, and it would be one customer at a time.   And it would require the attacker to maintain an agent on the exchanges network for the duration of the attack.     Definitely an order of magnitude more difficult.

Keeping the cost down and making it secure are actually the same goal... the little machine can't do more than SPV and doesn't have a lot of interfaces to hack.  im pretty close.   keeping LND nodes cheap is important.

The orphan rate thing has been tested or testnets repeatedly, and in many altcoins, and it's mostly a non-issue.  Reducing the block reward a bit and rewarding uncles a bit can prevent resulting localization problems.  Overall a 2 minute time with a smaller reward and some uncle rewards would be a fine hard fork that no one would ever agree on.   But it would probably work.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:31:28
Actually, you'd need to wait about 16 blocks to get the same security for 6.   There's an exponential factor involved because of the repeated chaining, so reducing the block times actually does have a net improvement in security over time.

That's not disingenuous.   The fraction is based on the game theory needed to secure the ledger... not the us dollar equivalent.  Increasing the size of the block weakens the security of the system.   If I had millions of dollars tied up in a blockchain account, I'd be trying to keep the ledger small, the fees high, and the incentives to secure my money firmly in place. 
Accordingly, 0.1BTC tx should happen on the lightning network.   Not the main chain.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:49:26
It costs nothing to set up a node if you have a laptop lying around.   I've done it.   Free download, I paid $2 in fees because I didn't care how long it took to clear, but yes, the more money you stick in a hub, the more useful it is.   
This is also true of bitcoin mining.   There is no difference here in centralization.
And yes, I do expect that the more highly regulated networks will be cheaper.   But this is the same for Bitcoin mining which can also be used for "weak censorship-at-a-cost".   Again, lightning is no different.   
People who pretend it is just haven't thought it through.   The network topology will also be similar (a few big miners, a few big hubs, lots of small miners, lots of small hubs)

Open ledgers render stellar useless for serious high volume tx.

@_date: 2018-01-05 14:26:12
All transactions are signed in old Bitcoin blocks.   The signatures are mixed with the tx without segwit in the scripts.   Now the sigs can optionally be in a separate segment.   P2WPKH is used to specify how the sigs are verified by the redeemer.
Also, in both legacy and segwit tx, you've got inputs and outputs as well in the main block, not just tx hashes.

Nope, it's even worse when throughput isn't an issue.   Because then the attack causes actual outages.   Look at what happens to ETH during a throughput attack.

You cannot really have a secure PoS without PoW.   Hybrid PoW/PoS is the best system.   PoS has security (nothing at stake) and offline (node offline for a long time) issues.   The slasher protocol and weekly PoW checkpoints solve these issues.   PoS vastly improves energy efficiency (less  work needed), it also improves protocol distribution (more staking nodes), scarcity (hiding money in staking nodes) and investment (more people involved in the protocol).

All I'm saying is that I've lived through Bitcoin going down on legitimately bad news (major exchanges hacked, China shutting down exchanges), and going down on "not news".   In my limited experience the "not news" stuff tends to be big flash sells followed by a a few days of recovery, whereas the "real news" stuff lasts longer.
Bitcoin took 2 years to recover from the Mt.Gox hack.   That would be roughly equivalent to Coinbase and Kraken and Geminii all getting hacked at the same time.
There simply isn't any news that's analogous.   So I'm expecting a swift recovery from whatever this is.

It's just a mistake, I'm sure they'll fix it. These NIST folks aren't completely idiots. It's a big, 57 page paper, and they probably just called a BCH fanatic to verify that section, rather than doing a little research. BCH was obviously a hard fork, since it wasn't backward compatible. I actually watched my node get kicked off the BCH network during the fork. It had quite a few BCH peers at the time.
And BTC is obviously a soft, backward compatible fork because 80% of the transactions on the network still use the old system, and even very old nodes and old hardware all still work flawlessly with the original Bitcoin.

Just looking at the bugs, we're pretty close to going from alpha to beta at this point.

Lots of people who were short did obtain spot positions in order to make that market.   However since its cash settled, there's no reason for them to sell and cover since the price largely went down.   At this point they can continue to make short markets safely.    
It's very hard to arbitrage long Bitcoin futures.   To do that you would have to short Bitcoin.    But that's hard to do safely and affordably.     So the futures market is extremely skewed.

Current core implementation works very well.  But it's true that the block chain is so big, it's hard for the P2P network to work in a decentralized manner.   It can take a week to sync a new core installation on a cable modem and a fairly modern machine.   And worse, the bandwidth on a listening node is now unacceptable for most consumers.
If we can get fraud proofs to work, a much larger block chain would be supportable, and if lightning is deployed Bitcoin can be more private and more P2P.

It's possible to make a very secure batch in ETH.   The real issue is that the gas for some of the accounting is too expensive to make it worthwhile.   So you wind up losing money (trivial to prove it's impossible to save money actually).   ETH subsidizes simple transfers (smart move).   Right now, even a pretty simple smart contract can cost $20 or more to execute though, while simple transfers are $0.60.   And those rates are extremely subsidized right now, with several hard forks to force prices down.   
Truth is, without a DAG-like system to break up the linear chain (Lightning, ByteBall, RAIDEN, etc.), none of these networks scale well.    And all of these projects have plans to switch to DAG-like commitments.
Personally, I think a hybrid PoW/DAG with a linear hard checkpoint like LND+Bitcoin, or RAIDEN+ETH, is the best way to go.   I just don't trust DAGs and PoS systems enough for big transfers, and I don't think chains work for small transfers.  Casper worries the hell out of me.   Looks great on paper, but I'd never want to move millions with it.

They will definitely do batching.   They don't charge fees and have to run a tight ship.   Also, ACH jobs batch.   So why change the code path?

For fee denomination.   Per-tx fees should be probably no smaller than 0.0001 though, or there are game-theory problems with double-spends.    So you really need a lightning network to make BTC work as a currency as the value grows.  
In other words, if we somehow manage to shrink tx size again, after segwit, we should also lower the blocksize to keep the fee levels correct.   Indeed, segwit itself should probably have come with a block size lowering to some extent.

There's not a lot of firms trading Bitcoin on long-term stat analysis.  If there was, this trend would be severely muted as those firms sold in advance of the trend, and bought in advance of the upticks.

OMG this is not news.   This has been reported on a million times.    It started in 2016, and this is just a continuation of existing policy to centralize payment processing via new Microsoft payments API.  
It has nothing to do with fees (which are paid by the sender, and can be reduced to near zero if the sender doesn't mind waiting a few hours to play their game).   It has nothing to do with anonymity or kyc, because there are no kyc laws for video games.   
Microsoft simply will not use a bleeding-edge payment system.   Expect Square to support Lightning network payments in 2018 first.   Then Microsoft Pay to follow some time in 2019.

@_date: 2018-01-09 19:19:30
Let me back up.
 - Anyone can create millions of zero or low fee transactions per second at basically no cost... and fill up mempools globally.   In fact Bitcoin has been under a sustained attack of this nature for over a year.  ETH also has sporadic attacks.   (Other alts are basically not under attack and so get to strut around proclaiming superiority until they too witness what happens when a well-funded attacker goes after then,)
 - So please assume that, at all times, the system is being flooded with low value TX and that the system is always "full".   There is no 1500/2000 situation.   Instead, popular cryptos are *always* at capacity with low-value Tx flooding the system.
 - With ETH.  All nodes on the system must "keep up" with the state machine.  If an attacker creates enough cheap tx that are slower to execute on some nodes and not others, the whole system starts locking up.   
 - ETH fixes this by hard-forking the entire system enforcing a global minimum rates charged for various operations.   This works. 
 It fixes the problem, keeps spammers out, but can cause things to get artificially expensive if ETH's value goes up (right now some simple smart contracts can cost over $200 to execute).   And it doesn't actually prevent someone from killing ETH, it just makes it more expensive.
 - BTC's response to excessive TPS is to cap the blocks, keeping the VPS about the same, and causing increased fees when under attack.   BTC itself never locks up or crashes no matter how aggressive the attack.   Fortunately, fees also drive up security and mining investment.   So they aren't paid "for nothing".   Indeed, the high fees we pay now are deepening ASIC investment, mining development, etc.
 - If Bitcoin weakens the security of the system to accommodate smaller tx, we actually reduce the security of those million dollar transfers that drive-up our VPS.   And we make it less likely that people doing big transfers will trust Bitcoin if there's no way for them to pay for priority.  Sure, we gain TPS.   But a loss in security is not acceptable.
 - The average BTC tx is estimated at $84K.   So from a VPS throughput standpoint, BTC is the king... beating all other cryptos.
 - The problem might be your definition of throughput.   
 - It's obviously (to me) "value per second" (VPS) that we need to optimize for, not tx/sec (TPS).     TPS is nice, but can never come at the expense of security of VPS.    
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:53:32
The cost to mine an ETH block, is about $4000.   How can that secure a million dollar transfer against a double spend attack?
Nobody on the ETH network runs full nodes anymore.   Attempting to start one takes weeks to get online.
ETH, with its 10% inflation rate, is like a race car heading towards a cliff.  
Get out before the cliff.

Really?   So 2 years ago when the liquidity was so poor you would lose 1% to slippage when you tried to cash out on a $10K money transfer was better?
Bitcoin's utility function has *changed*.   But it can move more money per hour securely than any other crypto.   It's far, far better than it was 2 years ago for people who need to move $1000 or more.   It's almost useless for people who want to move less than $5 quickly.
Whatever.   I'd rather capture the big money, and build out a layer 2 system for the small stuff.   Just makes more sense.
How anyone thinks you can secure a $1m transfer with the same fees as a $1 transfer is beyond me.   Nobody will use alts for big money moves.

@_date: 2018-01-26 20:44:54
Yep that's what that's about.   
And the reason why DNSSEC is nice is that you can verify that there's no MITM tricking you into sending BTC somewhere else.   (Like with SSL, for example).
And you don't have to be "online" to verify these requests.
The downside is that anyone can verify the receipient... so there's 100% loss of privacy on any tx to these addresses.   IE: everyone can know that the payment was to amazon.com and the govt can subpoena amazon for the address that the stuff was shipped to on that tx.
But a lot of users actually don't care about that.   And the loss of privacy is not something that's shared... ie: my loss of privacy doesn't cause other people to lose privacy.
So that's why it's not available in any BTC tools.

estimatefee uses a normal distribution instead of poisson so the fees are very high.   earn.com has better estimates.   Right now,  $4 for simple segwit gets you in very quickly.

Nope, miners have to enforce segwit rules or their blocks will get invalidated by enforcing nodes.  There are 100 or so test-cases that prove this in the source code.   This was the main thing that almost prevented segwit from being approved... so it's a huge deal.

- Gemini will need to ditch the idea of using a single auction for price discovery in order to comply with manipulation rules
- And so forth.

All exchanges should be assumed fractional unless audits prove otherwise.   Coinbase has refused to respond appropriately to audit requests.   
They said they would issue BCH to everyone, but then in a last-second turnaround, they launched simultaneous trading pairs on all of their exchanges.

Even if they seem less reactive, I suspect block-based estimates that use regression for prediction will dominate eventually.   Ignoring the mempool is important in a fee estimator!  Large miners can stuff the mempool with tx that they will never mine...inflating mempool size and estimates.  But actual block fees cannot be gamed.

Bitcoin price has gotten a bit ahead of the scaling roadmap.   Segwit adoption is increasing and is lowering fees slowly.   Lightning networks should be live in a few months.   These should hold BTC up for the next 3x in price.   But we need schnorr sigs just to survive now, not as some sort of cool optimization.    And wallets are super far behind.   Electrum is the only mobile wallet with full segwit support.   And exchanges are killing fees by jacking prices instead of upgrading tech.
BitPay isn't even trying to get lightning working.
My guess is that a new generation of wallet providers, merchants, and exchanges will crop up using this new tech to draw in customers sick of high fees.

This is the introduction of institutional trading.  It's just the beginning.   Once there's a robust futures market...which could take a year... ETFs will likely be approved (maybe a year from now?).   Etc. Etc.    This a stepping stone to global institutional use of Bitcoin as a financial lever.  
More likely: the futures simmer slowly, and the results are mixed for a long time.  
It's very hard to make a robust futures market in something that is prone to theft ... in ways that hard assets cannot be.   AFAICT this will be the first digital asset futures market.

You do him a favor (protecting him from an even shittier execution), and pick up a few bucks in exchange.

No it's against the concealment of the source of funds *from* a financial institution.   Coinbase *is* a financial institution.   So if you send Bitcoin to Coinbase... and they ask where you got it, and you don't tell them, you can go to jail for 10 years.

Bitcoin is amazingly scalable now because it can do chained commits now.   Because of the way tx refer to prior tx, BTC can scale far better than others where this is not possible.
Now you have do define "scaling" .   I define it as the ability to move a lot of money.   If you tried to move $10mil on the ripple market, you'd lose 20pct to liquidity slippage.   On the bitcoin network, you can do this at 2pct or less.
Bitcoin scales because the security later is expensive enough to secure large transfers.   And it scales because the signature layer allows commitment chains.
Anyone who complains about scaling that doesn't know what liquidity is isn't worth talking to.   And that's the problem with most people who complain.   They don't believe lightning works... even though it will be released in 2018.   They don't understand finance and why Bitcoin already scales well. 
And then, knowing nothing, they demand attention.

Right now Bitcoin grew too fast.   The plan was to have lightning ready before Bitcoin "mooned" and made tx too expensive.  But it's only just started tests on mainnet for the first time last week.   And the mobile wallet can only spend - not receive.   So it's just not ready for prime time.
That being said, most heavy users ... ie exchanges and the arbitrageurs driven by exchange support, are simply not using segwit... and this is causing fees to be at least double (actually more than double because of the hockeystick pattern).
Apparently most people using bitcoin simply don't care about the fee.   If they did, they would switch.

It counts because you have put forth the theory that "high fees matter and a block size increase is sensible".   This theory should be based on user feedback.

Because you don't have to refer to your prior transaction, ethereum has a state-machine issue... all of the transactions have to be ordered in a certain way and cannot be chained offline.   
So ETH cannot scale in a layer 2 network the way Bitcoin can.   I can, with Bitcoin, have tx1-&gt;tx2-&gt;tx3 all offline, and I can be sure that as long as tx1 clears, tx2 and tx3 MUST be capable of clearing.   But with ETH, tx1 can clear, and then some txZ can get *injected* .... killing the chain.
ETH has had major backlogs and outages because of this.   Bitcoin cannot have these problems.   It simply is better architected for future growth.

Close.   
If you have a standing buy 3 devs below, and it returns to 1 dev below... you sell it.   Because you don't want the market moving against you and your algo is just to capture stupid executions that occasionally happen.  3 devs is huge and rare (depending on your time window, it can happen like once a month).
Obviously, if you're bullish, you can tweak it to 2 devs below and sell at the mean.   Or whatever you feel like.   But I can't tell you how many times people put in HUGE market sells on Coinbase and drive the price down so much that there's basically no chance of losing money on a quick buy and sell the bounce.

It is so incredibly trivial for an exchange to prove its assets, and even it's liabilities.   Open source code is available to produce a neat JSON file that can be verified.
Here's one example:

Nope.   Value investing is based on expected future dividends ... the "value" of the underlying.    
In Bitcoin land that would be investing based on projected global money supply increases vs some measure of volatility.   
That day is many years away, but today's futures launch is a step in that direction.

The idea of these two living side by side is flawed.   I see two scenarios: 1) The first smart contract killer apps that come out are on Ethereum's network.   High utility will drive adoption (you need Ether to play), the network effects will slaughter bitcoin, which has a horribly low utility ratio now (utility/market cap ratio).   Bitcoin falls down over time, losing market share to the higher utility coin.    or 2) The first smart contract killer apps that come out are on Bitcoin's network - and Ethereum completely disappears overnight.
I cannot imagine them living side-by-side.   This is "the best app wins".

Right.   You have to broadcast all parties public keys to begin with.  Otherwise you cant compute L and L2.
I guess that's what you meant by interactive.
Musig has the same requirement of course.  The set of all public keys must be known before signing begins.
Likewise, if you want to create an output, you need all 3 pubkeys.... if only to verify that they work together.   Technically you only need 2.  But there would be no guarantee that the 3rd is valid.   Interpolation "in the exponent" of the 2... knowing 3 are needed... would be sufficient though.
When signing you only need 2 of course
I tried to use your variable names as much as possible.

That is absolutely incorrect.  This entire chart is plus or minus a huge %.  We could be at the bottom of the current cycle right now.

Absurd.   A white paper is simply not detailed enough to be a standard.   The core reference implementation is the closest we have to a standard.

Right.  You have to start with m of m.  Only when your want to add participants does there need to be a subshare step.
Until then it's equivalent to musig.
P1 and P2 roll random shares on the line.   
Then, yes, a verifiable subshare redistribution must be used to give P3 a consistent share.  That's an easy to implement step though.
There has to be a way to public key encrypt stuff for P3 and ship it out, etc.   If somebody tricks m of m participants into giving them a share they can obtain a valid share.  
That's the interactive part.
But why not stick with a protocol that's compatible with redistribution and recovery to beign with. 
Sticking the participants on a consistent line doesn't change the provable properties of the m of m scheme.  Only when you add a participant is there an issue.
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:00:52
Running "secret sharing on a MuSig combined key" means that you need the combined key at some point - basically breaks the whole idea of secure threshold sharing.
I'll try to write it up exactly how you wrote up the MuSig bip, with the same level of detail.   It's not very different from MuSig... in the base case of M vs M.... just using a polynomial instead of adding things up straight.   Then I'll add a secon on how to securely add participants without ever needed a combined key.

yes, very similar format for assets (singing string, etc.)  
- should publish as a BIP with a standard location to download from an  url, and with the URL (like the old favicon)
- the message to sign should probably not be choice/nonce, it should be domain name &lt;SPACE&gt; time.
- linking the assets to a domain is important, i think, and possibly adding an x.509 sig on an assets block (list of concatenated addresses is sufficient), would help add legal weight to the asset claim

Just like a credit card, one should consider bitcoin transactions as "unconfirmed" until settlement.   IE:   You can acknowledge the transaction immediately, but don't ship until, say, 30 minutes has passed.  This is pretty reasonable for physical shipping of products.   
But for faster, in-person transactions, you will need an online collaborator that provides guarantees, and instant confirms... taking the double-spend risk for a fee, like a credit card processor.   Of course, at a bar, you can usually just hand them a pint at scan time, and wait for 6 more confirms later, just like keeping a "tab".   Bars take much more risk day-to-day with chargebacks anyway.

I'm trying to develop a solution for this problem.  The concept is to enhance "signing" with SSL cert chain + blockchain + content verification.  In this way someone can create secure, independently verified content that can be traced back to a merchant (or, well at least to an SSL cert).   Merchants can supply a URI with, say, an invoice, and this content can be stored and verified by the consumer.  That way there can be recourse if a transaction is not fulfilled.   Likewise, a seller could verify tracking content at, say, USPS, and so forth.   A very lightweight change to existing clients could make this a reality pretty quickly.  More details:

Proof of liquidity is actually 4 proofs:
- crypto reserves (level 1)
- level 1 + crypto liabilities (level 2)
- level 2 + fiat reserves + (level 3)
- level 3 + fiat liabilities (level 4)
Oliver lalonde implemeted level 1  and level 2:
His implementation is just about right. 
We need a BIP published that encapsulates this, with "favicon-like" standard locations linked to domains and x.509 signing added so that a downloaded asset proof can be referred to.
The excuse exchanges have now is that there's no BIP for it, and it's a valid one. Once a standard is announced, there will be no excuses. My bet.... nearly every exchange dries up and dies in the face of transparency.
After Level 1 and Level 2 standards are published, then we can move on to standards up to level 4, which would, likely, include certified auditing firms, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:27:27
The ratio of moving average daily volume to audited liability balances should be fairly stable.   And if you saw more than 50% of the reserves... for a bank or an exchange, disappear... you'd have every right to be worried... unless you saw a corresponding drop in the average volumes.  You could have a published liability sheet as well, where you have customer signed liability balances.  Customers could then confirm that their liability matches what they expect.   Then when 30k disappears, btc-e can publish the corresponding liability adjustments..... and who is going to go out and verify that their published liability matches the published liability?  You'd need to add a feature to the Bitcoin-qt client that allows users to verify published liability totals.   And after all is said and done... you *still* need to publish reserves.   And a reserve standard can happen today... not after a patch to a client is shipped.   They need to be separate standards.

That "example" was Paypal.   Not FDIC insured, SEC not involved.  No regulation for years and years.   In 2005 they hit "bitcoin size" in capitalization, but they were processing far, far more transactions... an order of magnitude more.   And they weren't regulated at all.  Today, paypal is still "not a bank", and not subject to any of the rules of banks.    Paypal was required to register as a "money transmitter" in some states, but, even today, at over 60 billion ... they are not a bank.

Miners don't have to follow the discount rules, that's a convention - not baked in to the protocol.   And lots of core devs are fine backing that out.
Right now, It can takes weeks for a desktop user with a cable modem to install a full node, during which their hard drive, CPU and network is unusable while they download and verify the chain.   
"Grabbing an image" is a security fail.   I'm not going to trust your image.   But yeah, it would be nice if the full blockchain was downloaded at least as fast as bittorrent movies.  For me it's usually about 1/3rd the speed it should be.   If that's improved a lot, then arguments against block size increases dry up.
But if you blow up the block chain too much, the basic premise of Bitcoin can be easily broken.   A new user cannot simply download the main chain to verify balances and transfers - if it takes him a year to do so.   So new users will have to trust wallet vendors and SPV vendors, etc.   Which basically kills the whole point of Bitcoin.

BU created controversy out of thin air.... saying that Blockstream was trying to co-opt Bitcoin and claiming that lightning network will destroy Bitcoin.   If there's only one source base ... then you just upgrade.   If there's two... and there's people shouting in your ear saying that they are dangerous.... you wait until you see what other miners do.
So now 60% of the network is waiting.   And they will wait and wait forever, while a minority of miners signals for for a series of fragmenting proposals (BU/8MB/Segwit/Classic).
The longer they wait... the more the proposals will fragment.   How about "Bitcoin 2.0"  a nice new hardfork that allows easy, infinite scaling, but at the cost of a logarithmic slowdown for transactions coming from old addresses.   Sure... let's hard fork and get some pool on board.... 
I see it only getting worse, not better.    Which means we're stuck with "Bitcoin as is"

Actually, that's not how Bitcoin works at all. If you don't have a client that sees what other clients you intend to transact with - then you don't have something that's useful. It doesn't matter what you call it or what sort of dogma you subscribe to.   Blockchain is defined by what's relayed to miners. If miners don't see a transaction, then it doesn't exist. Full nodes define what exists.

publishing this protocol/standard will allow the creation of new and important services for users.
things i would add to the protocol:
- require standard paths to obtain liabilities and assets from a domain name... ie: btc-e.com/dcx/asset.json - akin to the old "favicon"
- instead of an arbitrary signing string, make it a standard (IE: &lt;domainname&gt;&lt;SPACE&gt;&lt;UTC TIME&gt;
- add a UTC TIME field to both the asset.json and liability.json 
- add x.509 signing files:  dcx/asset.sig, dcx/liability.sig making it possible to a) archive a statement and b) prove it was published by the domain in question in case that is in doubt
- require SSL

Yeah, miners promoting BU can simply and effectively game the system.  Most of the current "mempool" is crap.   Can't prove it, but my instinct is that it's not real stuff.   Also, Ethereum spikes *every* time someone bitches about segwit failing or the mempool growing.   This is, by and large, an altcoin war.   Thing is, if someone wanted to code an ethereum spam attack ... it would be trivial to overload the current eth network...   and it would cost a lot less.   And you could pre-load a smart contract to do it for you.   Someone will eventually get pissed off enough to do it.

Yeah, people don't get that mining power is really, really not important.   
Bitcoin can easily switch to an alternative PoW (using where difficulty for existing algo spikes and difficulty for new algo gradualy replaces it, for example)  and it would remain secure.
Nice thing about doing that is that existing miners, if they are behaving as bad actors would lose their investment.   Presumably new miners would understand that users and full nodes matter.

If they were signaling 8mb, and Segwit at the same time I would believe that they had the best interest of the network at heart, and not just political maneuvering.  8mb + segwit is quite reasonable.    Segwit now.  8mb with a 95pct threshold.

You wouldn't lose money. It would just take a lot more time to validate a transfer. It could take a day or more. But I think that's okay. I don't think it's reasonable for blockchains to grow too many terabytes and utxo is to grow to hundreds of gigabytes I think it is reasonable for old money to require some recycling or else it gets slower. Remember the core protocol hasn't changed a bit. The only thing that's changed so there's a lot more weakly validating nodes.

Wrong, and wrong again.   Bitcoin works as a series of checks and balances.   Any miner can mine a bullshit invalid block, but if fully validating nodes don't see it as valid it will be ignored.   And if other miners decide mine on top of it, they are mining a fork.   And even if that fork is reallllly long, it is useless - as long as it's invalid.   
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:19:57
In this case it's abundantly clear that nodes have been upgraded...there is no big influx of new nodes.  The only way to "fake it" would be to spin up thousands of nodes, and then simultneously knock other nodes off the network at the same rate.   Which didn't happen.
While "proof of work" is needed to prevent sibyl attacks - that's the *only* think it's needed for.   We do not need proof of work to do network upgrades, software overhauls, whatever.   If miners don't do their job and upgrade the code in concordance with the nodes... then they are behaving as bad actors and should be excluded.
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:57:19
Segwit allows something called cross-blockchain atomic swaps because you can chain unconfirmed transactions (a sent tx1 to b, b sends tx2 to a... but guaranteed to be contingent on tx1!).
This will allow someone to build an exchange where users buy btc for usd ... but there's no middleman.    The "onramp" for fiat can function, instead, like USDT (   These onramps can be safely insured, and run profitably, at little/no risk of theft. 
Then, once your fiat is encoded in a tethered token, you can trade directly with anyone... or use an order-matching service... but with no risk and no funds held by the matching services.
All of the trades can be routed quickly over order-matching networks, and with fierce competition for execution speed, liquidity and low fees.
Once users never have to keep bitcoin at exchanges... the bitcoin space will be a *lot* more stable.

I don't want to try to "convince you", because it's actually hard to understand it all, but BU looks to me like an attempt to allow a majority of colluding miners to steal Bitcoins.
And BU peeps don't even try to address it in their code.   nullc spends a lot of time explaining, and all people do is shit all over him in this subreddit.   r/btc is really horrible.
Think about it... small miners drop off, power gets consolidated in China, a few phone calls are made, and Satoshi's billions are moved ...  BU is an attack on the protocol itself.   And they don't need that many people to buy into it... they already have the hashpower.... all they need is plausible deniability.

Without publishing holdings, *any exchange* is essentially a scam waiting to happen.  We need a standard (many have be been proposed) for publishing a simple JSON file with a list of addresses and signatures, linked to a domain name.   Then another standard for liabilities.   Both have reference implementation already... but no BIP was drafted.   It's not that hard.   Once it's published and generally accepted as a standard, exchanges that *don't* publish ...  will perish.

Essentially people will be forced to do fewer, larger transactions.   You may buy bitcoin now $20/day.   But as fees grow you will change your buy to $140/week.   Then as they grow more, you change to $600/month - just to avoid fees.    At $5/transaction (which is a bitcoin price of about $6000), people with small savings accounts will stop using Bitcoin for a store of value.   But at that point, large institutions will be doing most of the trading.   Which is fine.

Hard forks are, at this point, too dangerous to the integrity of the Bitcoin network.    Thousands of nodes would drop offline if Bitcoin hard forked.    It already has a decentralization problem... even though you can spin up core and run it on an old laptop easily at home.

Clearly you haven't read r/btc or read anything posted by the "developers" of BU.   If you search for "segwit", it is uniformly denounced as a "complicated hack that will break bitcoin".   IT "departs from satoshi's vision".  It will turn Bitcoin into a "settlement network".   All couched in negative terms.   In addition, Roger Ver has specifically announced that he will pay people to mine BU and NOT to mine segwit.   Finally, none of the miners signallig for BU are also signalling for segwit, even thought they are not incompatible at all.  
BU is designed to fuck with bitcoin.   It's a 51% fork, with no 75% consensus safeguard (they removed it... even though they say they will do it in the FAQ... it's not in the code).   Without the BU spammers, segwit would have long since had the momentum it needs to succeed.

They are really not the heart of the system.   The heart of the system are the users, full node operators, exchanges, wallets and decentralized ledger.   Miners are a side-effect of wanting these things to work reliably.   If they choose to prevent regular maintenance upgrades... whether because they don't know how to upgrade to c++11 or because they are holding out for a hard-fork, then they can get the hard-fork they are asking for.   But it will not go in their favor.

Lightning networks could result in 90% going to nodes or more.   It actually scales tremendously.   In a future where lightning is successful, only large value transfers would happen on-chain, and even with fees of $50 or more, at $60 mil per day, this would still represent a small fraction of the overall fee space.

Correct. Most people couldn't afford it, and even if they could nobody would really want to. So now you've got Bitcoin nodes only run by Massive institutions. And I guess that's okay but then we've got to trust these massive institutions.  I thought the whole point was that anyone could run a full validating node, and validate the blockchain. So big institutions can't steal from us, like they did when the financial crisis happened.

Wrong: People who do not upgrade will be on the old network.   There are now two networks.   
The removal, entirely, of max block size from the rules - entirely - would work better than BU's proposal.   At least it wouldn't have convergence problems!   Of course, the reality is that most node would start dropping off the network, and small mining pools would follow...leaving Bitcoin valueless...  since it would be over centralized.   And the max # of TPS would never get past 50 or so because of network congestion anyway.   
The "old bitcoin" ...the one with limits, and probably segwit, would, on the other hand, remain trusted and decentralized.   It would, however suffer from 2 months of slow transactions ... after which it would recover fully.   
Exchanges will support both, of course, and it's likely the "old bitcoin" will remain bitcoin, and the new BU will be called "BUC" ... or something.  
It would kill Bitcoin's price.... but in the end you would have the answer to the question:  just how much do unlimited blocks kill decentralization?   My guess?

Bitcoin unlimited doesn't provide configurability. It provides a series of micro forks and the network will probably never Converge on a reliable basis. You're talking 40-minute confirmation times and other crazy crap if  unlimited goes down. I think "no block size limit" would be better than Bitcoin unlimited. At least with no block size, all nodes would validate what miners were mining. Massive blocks that couldn't be propagated on the network would just get ignored and that's fine.

The all-caps was an example of the kind of crap that is typically moderated away. Noticed that my comment would not be moderated because it was merely *illustrating* an example of a something that should be.
Your resorting to attacking grammar and out if context caps is evidence that you actually have no real argument.  Have you seen the stuff that's been moderated away?  
It's not just some people saying hey let's consider a block size increase, I have some really cool ways of doing that. I posted a proposal about  using fees to guide block increases so that it would converge better. 
Or, "hey look at this pull request"  That stuff has never been moderated. And you can find dozens of proposals and working drafts on block size increases for Bitcoin.
Open source works when everybody contributes. When people go off and do their own thing, that's a fork. If you can't achieve some sort of professionalism in the face of the rejection of your ideas, it seems like the only alternative around here is to begin attacking people.

BU pushes all of the power over bitcoin to a handful of large miners.  Large miners and large governments like BU.   Making the blockchain massive, killing scalable solutions.... this is what BU proponents are pushing for.   And their clever trick is to co-opt every argument against them:
They propose a complex solution, but the call segwit, a protocol simplification by any measure (ask Trezor why), complex.
They propose quite precisely to push more power over the protocol into the hands of a few large miners.  But they call segwit a "centralized solution"?   Really... something that makes it easy for anyone to spin up a raspberry pi lightning node and run their own fee gathering hub ..... *not centralized*.
And they propose to fork the network and to cause full nodes to drop off the network.   ....   then they call segwit "controversial" ... but the only controversy is generated by a few shills paid by Roger et al, and then the masses of uninformed people deciding there *must* be two sides to every fact.

4MB max block size is very big.   I'm running a full node, and it can consume quite a lot of bandwidth.   I had to upgrade my hardware to deal with it.

@_date: 2017-02-28 17:16:35
At 95% the likelihood of miners rolling back to an earlier version is extremely unlikely.   Safety is always some sort of a likelihood estimation.  A hard fork with a 95% activation and sufficient time for nodes to upgrade would be equally safe... which is why it's a bit disingenuous that core says hard forks are less safe..... that depends on how they are activated and coded.
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:59:31

Current version seems to work fine.  But there are other techs, like tumblebit, and side chains that are proven and also allow scale.    Growing the blockchain itself by much more than 2-4mb is probably a terrible idea though.  We've already seen how bad miners consolidate and collude today.
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:03:20
We have a tested solution to scaling Bitcoin in the short term - which opens up a lot of opportunity for growth - and miners aren't mining it because of FUD.   Most of that FUD is spread by BU.  So yeah, I'm pissed at them.   2MB is big enough for now. Bigger blocks break Bitcoin in so many ways.   Please try to install a full node on your desktop and then explain to me why.
@_date: 2017-02-12 02:24:46
Clearly Erik Vorhees has never tried to install a full node on a desktop machine.   If he had, he'd know that at 1MB, bitcoin can kill a home network.   And if you can't run it at home, then you have to trust someone else.   And if you have to trust someone else, then Bitcoin sucks.   Good think core is trying to make it so Bitcoin doesn't suck.
I think I have a solution where Bitcoin can hard fork, and we can go to 32 MB, but new nodes can come online in 24 hours with minimal bandwidth.   The idea is to have nodes download the blockchain history in reverse.   They will know the minimum (but not maximum) possible UTXO set and can verify new blocks as long as they refer to things internally consistent with what they know.  In other words a node becomes partially functional within 24 hours, and functional at 99% within a week... but it may take (forever whatever) to hit 100%.   And some nodes may choose not to (they could never validate satoshi block moves, for example, and that's OK).
Does it matter what the genesis block is?   Ultimately... no.   The end game is... if money sits untouched for long enough, it becomes harder to relay.   These new nodes will simply not relay them, and really.. that's a nodes perogative - it won't get kicked for it - even today.   So sweep your paper wallet every 4 years, or you might have a hard time getting it relayed.

0-conf is 99.9% probability of clearance with an adequate fee, no RBF and 20 second wait.   visa has no mediation process... they just take the money back if you say so.   if you think otherwise you've never been a merchant.  you cannnot reverse full-fee bitcoin transactions after 20 seconds... its extremely unlikely.   even the best double-spend implementations allow at most a 5 second wait to get 25% likelihood of success.

Sybil attack is not trivial in Vanillacoin, and the only thing an attacker could do would be to delay instant confirmations - indefinitely but at an increasing cost.

@_date: 2017-02-13 14:56:45
It could, theoretically.   But I'm not overly concerned with that.   This is a protocol that would allow Bitcoin to scale on-chain, *and* that would satisfy the critical requirement that validating nodes still be easily usable by end users.   I think the loss of long-standing permanence might be acceptable.   If you have to wait a month for some miner to validate 20-year old untouched funds.... I'm not too worried about that.   And it's easy enough to sweep old funds to a new wallet every few years to ensure this never happens.
I don't think this violates Bitcoin's core precept as a trustless distributed store of value.   If you allow addresses to get slower with age, you can scale on-chain 10x ... and have no "node" onboarding issues.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:16:48

Well, it's charity on one hand.   But if you do business in bitcoin, do you really want to trust some other node to tell you what a valid transaction is and how much money you have?  Who do you trust?   
I would never run a merchant business off an SPV wallet.   Right now, you need 200MB of RAM, 60GB HDD, and about 30% of a desktop CPU just to run a node.    
If that doubles, I'm cool.  But if it grows to 10x ... I think it will kill the protocol in many ways.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:34:20

If segwit is implemented, it becomes trivial to use instruments like USDT to perform atomic swaps for bitcoin.   At that point, there is no purpose in keeping money within an exchange, since you can combine these swaps with chained, unconfirmed transactions to produce high speed order flow without needing to commit to the blockchain until you collapse the swap channel.   Effectively, it becomes possible to build a high quality, high speed exchange platform ...where the traders do not need to keep their funds within the exchange... and instead keep them in "channels" which can be collapsed to the blockchain at any time.   
So you still pay a fee during a withdrawal (channel close fee).   But not for each trade.

Mining is the most important thing you can do for the network.   Everyone who says to "run a full node" doesn't get that that doesn't help very much.   It helps a little, don't get me wrong.   But the biggest problem with bitcoin is that miners are concentrated.
If 200k bitcoin users went out and bought mining machines instead of just buying Bitcoins:
 -  
 -  (this indirectly support's jihan)
And pointed them at pools that supported core development... this process would be over tomorrow.
 - 
 -  (be sure to select "core" in the dropdown for support)
.... others?

At that level Bitcoin will have $1 fees for transactions sometimes $3.   This makes it useless as a daily transaction system. And it will only be useful as a store of value.   Like those giant stones that were once used as currency. People issued IOUs and avoided the very expensive and very slow "moving of the stone".
Essentially people will be forced to do fewer, larger transactions.   You may buy bitcoin now $20/day.   But as fees grow you will change your buy to $140/week.   Then as they grow more, you change to $600/month - just to avoid fees.    At $5/transaction (which is a bitcoin price of about $6000), people with small savings accounts will stop using Bitcoin for a store of value.   But at that point, large institutions will be doing most of the trading.   Which is fine.

So some time in December Bitcoin might be able to compete with today's Ethereum on smart contracts... which, in the meantime, will be busy eating Bitcoin's lunch with its 10 second blocks, 30 TPS.   By December, ETH will be on PoS with parallel execution at 1000TPS or more, and the smart contracts won't be beta... they will be live with a nice GUI.   By December ETH will be on btc-e, and maybe itbit/gemini, there will be commercial paper contracts running on ETH, and it will be at a 3 billion market cap... well on the way to displacing bitcoin. 
Too little, too late.    We need a much more aggressive roadmap.   Segwit should be launched in march not april.   Lightning network needs to be integrated into wallets now, not later - or green address should replace the central trust with a web-of-trust to get real instant confirms working now.

No proposal to let peer consensus interfere with blockchain consensus.   This is merely a 0conf affirmation system - allowing 0conf low-value transactions with high certainty.

@_date: 2017-03-14 02:56:48
Well, there are different techniques.   
I have a theory that using UTXO checkpoints, you can create a sub-chain that never needs to fully clear to the main chain.   Instead, a merge-mined subchain has a main-chain UTXO block mined every X subchain blocks, where X is a function of the security of the subchain.   
The subchain can take bitcoin in and can send bitcoin out at any time.  Peers only need to download and maintain a short history of 2X blocks, because UTXO's can be trivially validated.
You get the some of the security of the main chain from those miners who validate UTXO's, mine all of the blocks of cross-chain transactions (and get all the rewards from that), and also receive all fees from the subchain.   
You can run a subchain with 60 second block times, and 2MB blocks... basically 20 times faster than Bitcoin, and not really worry about orphans, because you don't really care if the network becomes segreated or used only in a certain region of the world.   In fact, regional subchains would be the best way to organize them.   And of course the size of the subchain is meaningless, since it's frequently and repeatedly checkpointed with the main chain as a reference.
This allows miners to fully participate in massive, sharded scaling.   But to work it would help to have segwit, so you can chain unconfirmed main chain transactions on the subchain... until they are moved back to the main chain.   
Basically all layer 2 solutions benefit from segwit... it vastly improves Bitcoin.

at 2 cents/kwh which is about what most us miners in washington state pay, even if you assume equipment and internet fees are sunk costs, miners will be out of business in 88-240 days (0 profit due to difficulty increases and halving) (10%-20% difficulty increases)
at 1.5 cent/kwh which is the what the cheapest chinese miners pay, the time until profits end is about 120 days.
at that point, lots of miners will drop off, causing difficulty to decrease, and stabilize at some very low level.   the result of that die off will be consolidation in one region of china, and maybe some in iceland and maybe some in washington state (maybe).   that will be it.  difficulty will then stabilize and profits will large come from collusion and breakthroughs in ASICs (meaning mining becomes limited to a handful of chip manufacturers).
unless bitcoin switches to POS or POB or something like that, miners will only be located in a few scattered places in the world, and there will be even more consolidation into fewer pools.   which is why bitcoin is doomed, and things like ethereum - which have a roadmap that escapes POW (proof of electicity), are not.
i do believe, however, that bitcoin has a very real chance of switching to proof of burn.   it's very similar to proof of work (something at stake!), and would serve to stabilize industry.

Someone pointed out to me that my math didn't include leveraged shorts.   So you could make even more with less money.   Some places have 5x leverage on shorts.   So you really need about $200k invested to sustain a fee-based attack that remains profitable.   The only way to prevent this is to scale the hell out of Bitcoin.   Like 10x.

Very few in core actually want smaller blocks. What they want are the benefits of smaller blocks. 
They are pushing nevertheless to roughly double the current size.  Unfortunately this may temporarily reduce fee income...which is probaby why miners are fighting back. 
If the benefits of smaller blocks can be achieved without making blocks smaller, that would be ideal.  UTXO commitments, MimbleWimble exenstion blocks, fraud proofs can all get us there.

You would need to own 40% of the nodes to pull off vote rigging, which is not impossible, just not trivial:     Remember, this is to accelerate low-value transactions.   And nodes accumulate weight over time.   So you can't spin up new nodes to attack.   You have to leave them running for a while.... which is expensive enough that you can 0conf clear stuff less than 500USD very safely.

Miners want Bitcoin's price to stay the same or slightly increase.   That maximizes their revenue over time.   The don't want block sizes to "double" all at once.   They might go to 1.2MB or something.   Doubling is huge and pools see segwit as too big of an increase.

not really.   i mean, no one can find you by a port scan, but ultimately you can broadcast the port you listen on via the p2p network itself.   probably it makes more sense to use another port, and have a long list of seed peers... rather than a short list of seed peers and a default port

Algorithm that decentralizes things a bit: enforce p2ool as the only way to pool-mine, easy enough to prove it was used... just check the outputs against the p2pool or refuse the block.   Existing miners and mining pools get to keep doing what they are doing... but anyone who wants to leave their mining pool, at any time, can install p2pool to do so and be equal or better.  Gradual de-escalation over time.   Only problem is:  mining pools would never install this.  Oh, and they control everything.

@_date: 2017-03-23 08:40:49
I agree it may not be effective.   "Possible" is a loaded word.   You can do this in a soft fork:  send a half-fee tx, but with output set to an address with script that is pay-to-any in old system, but in the new system is only payable to some prior miners (X blocks ago?... thinking about it).  Old miners won't mine it at all.   
New miners can mine it for the anticipated future fees.  
Problem is there's less to prevent miners from mining 0 byte blocks to steal pooled fees.   Hard to tell how miners would respond to it.   
It can be a purely opt-in soft fork (choose whether your tx is pooled-fee or not).   Maybe it would induce better behavior?

Exactly.   So now miners are paralyzed... on one hand, they want to scale.   On the other hand they have groups of developers *on both sides* telling them that both BU and Segwit are horrific and broken.
To be fair.   BU - without at least a 75% activation threshold - is broken.   I guess the idea is that nobody will change their max block size until some later unspecified time?   But this idea is flawed, because everyone I talked to who runs BU has a wild set of divergent sizes 2MB, 8MB and 16MB configured.

Bitcoin on the other hand won't drop by more than another 15% at absolute worst, or back at 11 hundred tomorrow. So if you actually care about the long-term value of your money but Bitcoin. If you care about gambling, buy alt coins, they're super fun and super volatile.

The most illustrative comment is simple:   LN will make it so entities can collect user tx fees without mining.   
Essentially, LN appears to make it so that miners are slightly less relevant.   Since LN commitments aren't, directly, POW mined.    
Miners want *more mining*  ... so they will vote via hashpower to active proposals that foster more mining.   
Instead of promoting LN, we should promote fast, two way pegged and mined side-chains.   They will still allow a nice Layer 2... while Bitcoin remains unencumbered by spam.   As long as you keep mentioning LN, miners will shy away from segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:35:33


Yeah, that's pretty close.   I was proposing that the *entire utxo* gets vetted - on top of the provided SPV security.   That way a side chain's full nodes can use very little disk space while still providing a fast, full featured blockchain.
Drivechain alone would be sufficient to get started.   UTXO proofs are just ways to keep a fast/massive side chain from getting too big.  Still, all of these proposals benefit from segwit, and suffer without them.   Even drivechain alone.

BU nodes are, by default,  configured to accept whatever miners agree on after some block depth.  Essentially, the only effect of changing the defaults would be to have problems using the software.
Miners vote for block sizes in BU, not users.
The real issue is that there's a block size doubling via segwit ...

Ethereum transaction size is a fixed size, like 1MB, but multiplied by  the exponential moving average of the number of bytes per transaction - essentially growing block size slightly in response to increased sig use and adopion/utxo complexity.   Ethereum starts with a number more like 50MB though.   So it's initial configuration is much higher.   As a result, it has had to hard fork to deal with block chain and UTXO bloat.  In response, Ethereum has added fixed minimum transaction fees (gas limits whatever) to prevent attacks from being very inexpensive.
If Bitcoin were to adopt a 20 sat/byte fixed minimum fee + 8MB blocks, + scaling factor based on the number of bytes/tx - that would be roughly equivalent in Bitcoin land.

r/btc is a handful of users by comparison.   node counts *before* BU existed are impossible to falsify.   Then all you have to do is look at the set of ip's at that time, and then look to see if they upgraded... or if the current nodes running segwit are new.    They are not.   Everyone just upgraded.   
No major exchanges run BU.  No major wallet vendors run BU.   Basically the only people promoting it are big miners who buy Jihan's ASIC's.

You can create a 4MB extension soft block fork and a new address space, and boom... larger blocks that phase-in gracefully as more users use them and more wallets support them.   No reason to screw over hundreds of thousands of hardware and software developers with a backward incompatible protocol upgrade.  Contentious hard forks are very very bad for the network.   The definition of "contentious" is very clear in Bitcoin's core group:  if any experienced developer objects... it's contentious.   Segwit passed this very high bar.   Core is an incredibly diverse group.   Blockstream might employ about 20% of the devs, but there are plenty of others who would have shut down segwit if it wasn't a solid improvement.
BU is preventing a block size increase.   Do you seriously think that miners would raise the block size if BU took off?   They are all signalling EB=1 right now.   The primary reason BU is mined is to prevent segwit:  this keeps fees high for the mining pools.
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:37:36

@_date: 2017-03-30 02:26:20
No.  Segwit is backward compatibile.   BU supporters can signal segwit "ready" without actually installing the code if they don't trust it, and segwit will do no harm.  Also sewit tx wI'll be slow, b/c they will not be mined as frequently.  That would be a rational protest.
All miners of BU are currently signaling EB=1, blocks. They are not pushin for larger blocks in any way.
The simple fact is, BU is boosting pool income by keeping fees high.

@_date: 2017-03-25 16:21:37
$0.50 is way too much to send a million dollars overseas. The reason why this is dropping is because fees are too high. If blocks were bigger than fees would be free and if free fees is what Bitcoin is all about. Everybody know that free sells better. Look at how often people love free hamburgers. Free is the thing that made Bitcoin great.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:24:10
BU's purpose is to *remove control* over blocksize from users.   
Currently, many pools want smaller blocks so they can milk fees - so BU is popular with them.   
Later, they may want larger blocks to bring in more users.   The problem is that the mechanism BU uses to do this will result in constant network instability.   
Someone can have a wallet , and they will think money hasn't arrived because you sent them money from a wallet with a different EB or AD setting.   It's possible for a BU network to *never* converge, depending on how users and miners are currently wrangling.   They even admit it on their home page.  (There is "no solution" to this problem)
I'm a fan of bigger blocks.   I would like to see max block size set to the median*1.05 of the last 1000 blocks.  
BU is the worst block size proposal to date... and the reason it has so much support on some pools is because it is preventing a blocksize increase today.   XT and Classic never got close.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:24:32
I thin there is nothing that can be done.   If miners of a non-consensus protocol hit 75%, they can successfully and profitably render the minority chain completely useless, while propping up their own chain's value with arbitrage.   
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:35:36
There are no capacity problems.     Bitcoin has a fee market created by a capacity limit.  This is a feature that protects the long -term security of the chain.  Core has proposed an upgrade that will allow Bitcoin to scale without altering the fee market for large value transactions significantly.
Indeed, Bitcoin would be much better off if fees were higher for large value tx. You can figure out why trivially. 
But fees, because they affect the poorest members the most, are a populist issue.  A group of miners is trying to use this populist issue to take over control of the source code and the protocol.
This same group has said they might also change the monetary policy.
There is no future for Bitcoin under the auspices of this group.

Exactly: There is absolutely no functional difference between a 0 conf and and RBF transaction, except that the software you use to calculate likelihood of confirmation will have to maintain *two likelihoods*.   One for RBF transactions, and one for regular ones.   I'll bet that RBFs will be 10% slower.   And I'll also bet that people don't use them as much.

@_date: 2017-03-25 16:50:59
That is a fun idea. Basing a proof of work off some sort of prediction market.  You would need a median-oracle to feed the actual results into the system. And it would have to be trivial for the oracles to get it right, and pay to play. 
And... the oracles would also need to be rewarded for helping to secure the chain. But that still doesn't protect against sybil attacks.  
In fact, sybil attack protection is *all* a protocol really needs.  Very hard to get that right without resorting to some sort of centralized solution.
That's why you need Bitcoin. It can be a source of protection to guard any number of oracle side chains.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:50:56
Even a minority of miners can mine with lower fees and full blocks.  A few large pools can not trivially collude to keep fees high.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:36:22
Yep.   And there's a reason why antpool will mine a 0 transaction block.   There are significant incentives to "not having to validate" transactions.   Any time your algorithm decides to not validate a transaction, it can stuff a transaction in that pays high fees.    Since those transactions can be validated in advance, it costs you nothing in time... which is why antpool does it.   Indeed "churning" the blockchain in this way will probably make you money, since many algorithms use average fees to predict the fees required to mine a transaction.
Segwit fixes this, by the way, because the quadratic hashing problem is largely resolved - and this is the main reason some transactions get dropped.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:34:03
Segwit vastly increases mining fees for miners.   But they don't understand that.   And it has never been explained properly to them.   But yes, this is the primary reason they are voting for BU... to control fees.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:11:55
Under segwit fees might drop to 10 cents because of bigger blocks.  Miners don't want that.  Fortunately,  bitcoin, will scale.  And LN will allow millions of users enough fees to spike without affecting users directly.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:04:25

@_date: 2017-02-03 16:54:21
Yep, but they will have competition.   Which they don't really have today.   And they see BU as a way to keep it that way.
@_date: 2016-03-22 18:56:40
Exactly, that's precisely how it should be designed.   And it should be packaged promoted by core - enforced by default.   A full node could include a wallet address for 0conf consensus fees to be delivered to.   This is a "weak network" operating by consensus, prone to Sybil confusion (not theft).   All transactions are mined normally on-chain.   It's just a way of having full nodes certify that double-spends are "very, very unlikely" for small, fast transactions.   And it can be designed in a way that incentivizes full nodes - solving another well known Bitcoin issue.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:14:50
It's a node that validates blocks and that underpins an active wallet used for transferring value.   The most significant are those run by exchanges &amp; SPV wallets.   Many, however, are just users that have a machine somewhere with a large amount of bitcoin on them.    It doesn't really matter what miners do... if those users don't upgrade their software to listen... then those miners are wasting their hashpower mining blocks that will be ignored.

Well, I do think that Bitcoin's core distro should come with a better fee estimate system, like Electrum or Airbitz.
Maybe there should be a 0.1% fee minimum in the GUI - so that very large value transactions have a very high priority, and miners get rewarded?  
Miners can, of course, choose to ignore large value TX that have shitty fees just to get things going in the right direction... I mean really, moving $10 mil for $1 is robbery.

The market cannot possibly be used to create a wire-protocol, defy physics and substitute for engineering and research.  If the market wasn't "stupid" it wouldn't have thrown money at "Dash".  
Segwit increases usability.   Miners are stopping it?   Because they are afraid of losing revenue.   Even if it means the ability to onboard millions of new users.   Miners are signalling for support for an untested, shoddy piece of code as an alternative... run by their own pet developers.
Not a single meaningful user has installed the code.   So there's no way it can possibly work.   But yet... they still signal.  Clearly miners don't understand how Bitcoin works... and we're supposed to trust them to make protocol changes?
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:15:31
Absolutely!  But who's going to do the simulation that critically demonstrates how scaling bitcoin primarily via layer 2 networks and secondarily via block size increases will onboard more users and raise fees faster than scaling other ways.   Cute memes with pies in them aren't enough.   Maybe someone should just raise a few K on reddid ... and post a freelance gig to do this proof?   Seems like a good community investment.   I would be happy to run it, but I would rather see someone from the core camp with a better understanding of the specs to do it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:03:36
Wow, he just basically lies on so many levels.   Why?
1) Core is an *open community* in which anyone can participate - quite the opposite of a dictatorship.   It's actually too open, IMO, because any jerk (namely me) with an idea can make a BIP or post crap in the dev forums and it's rarely filtered.
2) A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade.   This has never occurred.
3) 60% of users, nodes, exchanges and wallets have signaled support.   It's abundantly clear this is not some sort of sibyl support... it's real community support.   
So on all 3 points, the facts run precisely counter to his arguments.   Effectively, he is just saying the opposite of what is happening and hoping people will believe him because .... he manufactures ASIC's?   How is biting the hand that feeds you good for business?  I really have a hard time understanding his motivations, unless someone has a gun to his head....

A handful of pools in China want the block sizes to stay small.   They control most of the mining, and they are OK with keeping the protocol limited in the current way.   If they think a failure to extend the network jeopardizes the whole network, they might respond well to a small increase.   But that's about it.

In addition, since LN does not work unless # of users is very large.   In other words, it is a prerequisite for LN to function that the network be full and crowded with users that want cheap, lower-security, high-speed transactions.   Without critical mass, LN is fairly useless, as no routes will be found.   
In other words:  LN does not represent a threat... until it represents a viable solution.

In general, mining alternative utxo's on-chain should be sufficient to scale Bitcoin for massive numbers of small-value transactions.  I don't think it's necessary to do compression.   If a side chain is checkpointed using a utxo hash to the main chain, then some portions of prior transactions on that side chain can be safely discarded.   "Settlement to the main chain" might not even ever be needed.   
Bitcoin may have worked better from the beginning if a utxo hash was mined (and verified) in each block anyway.   Who cares what the history is... if you have a series of utxo hashes, and you have the last 10000 transaction blocks....you can be sure that in order to fool you some miner would have had to have 51% for a year.  So ... done and done.  
Right now Bitcoin ships with a hard coded UTXO (ZERO) and checkpoint (Genesis).   If the UTXO was mined into the chain... then any new node that spins up could just download a UTXO, and verify that it's part of the main chain.   Indeed, the main chain need *only* consist of mined UTXO blocks... and the extension chain can be kept around for a few thousand blocks to protect against double spends.
This unfortunately allows a near infinite-number of transactions per block.... making lightning networks useless. :(

Miners can include un-broadcast 200 sat/byte tx all day long to fool fee estimators for no cost except for some dust they choose not to include in order to prop up fees.   
This behavior is rewarded with the higher fees users pay, and only punished with less adoption of Bitcoin.   
Large and colluding miners can also pump thousands of tx into the system with low sat/byte knowing a) they won't mine it and b) their friends won't mine it - losing only small $$ to other miners.
It's trivial for miners to game the fee market with spam.   It's very hard to track spam and prevent spam.
Maybe pooled fees (average of last X block fees) might help?

Really, it's more like 31 to 37 I think, because of variance.    But 30% is just running an old version of core...  So that' 61% core. I think we'll get segwit from with about 55% of the network forcing the change via USAF, unless some miners switch from BU.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:10:41
Core already tested the effect of larger block with and without segwit.   They ran a 4MB "blocks full" test on testnet and concluded it worked fine.   The point of a lightweight fork is to allow core to do all the work, and just make minor, non-contentious and trivially reviewed changes to the code to allow larger sized blocks... and a simple switch to enforce that segwit is now required on all tx outs after the activation height.  
If you maintain it as a persistent and mergeable pull request, maybe some day core will merge it.   And if they don't at least you have something fairly non-contentious that big blockers can run without causing market panic.

I agree we can handle more.   But please try to install a full node on a desktop machine first before handing full control over mining size to a handful of Chinese pools that can raise it to 8MB  (current est size from BU) - forcing thousands of existing nodes off network - and preventing layer 2 solutions by blocking segwit.   Indeed, blocking segwit even prevents distributed exchanges and other layer 2 solutions from ever existing.   Meaning big exchanges and big miners win.   
Users need to still have a say in Bitcoin!   Scaling bitcoin is even less important to BU proponents than blocking segwit and preventing a fixed monetary supply:

I am an ordinary user that runs a full verifying node.   And to be honest, if this ceases to be the case, the Bitcoin experiment is over.   Collusion between full node operators will be sufficient to invent new Bitcoins out of thin air.   A sybil attack or hack of a handful of full node operators can break the protocol overnight.   
Lightning is not the ideal layer 2.   Pegged sidechains are my favorite.   But without segwit and block size restrictions - they don't work either.   Indeed, without segwit and block size restrictions - there will be no layer 2.
If you like unlimited block chains, just buy Ethereum - it's already unlimited.   And it does everything you say.   There are lots of altcoins that are unlimited.
Layer 2 solutions, especially checkpoint side chains, allow people to participate and even build savings in Bitcoin without significant fees.   Sidechains are trivial compared to lightning, so can be rolled out more quickly.

Segwit is a protocol rule change, and it's a *soft* protocol change.   As long as miners either a) do nothing or b) upgrade... they are OK.   But if they choose to c) do something weird like mine an invalid block according to segwit rules... then they *will* get forked off the network - even if they have most of the hashpower.   Which means they are mining a chain that's valueless.
Personally, I would never use a UASF segwit transaction unless 51% of the miners were signalling.   But we could UASF now... and segwit will be "safeish for small transactions"  ...

The only thing BU miners could do is cause fees to rise about 20% on the BTC chain by mining 0 byte blocks.  Not even worth defending against.

You have to understand how BU works.   There is no way, under BU, for users that want to run full nodes to stop the blocks from growing to hundreds of megabytes.  Even at 100TPS, the number of transactions broadcast under BU will prevent average users from running Bitcoin nodes.
Once you have 100TPS the chain will grow to TB's in a few months.   and and several PB over the years.  Nobody can run/validate this "BU coin" except large Chinese pools and a few big exchanges.   
It will cost so much to run the nodes that either fees will legitimately have to rise - or the monetary supply will have to change.     BU devs have already had serious discussions about monetary supply changes.   A "0.5%" fixed rate was discussed as viable... allowing the miners to profit, and fees to remain near zero forever.   
So we're done... Bitcoin gets to have an inflation rate, and a handful of groups control it...   It's bullshit coin.
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:00:36

It's incredibly difficult to understand what's wrong with BU at the core without understanding fully all the mechanisms that make Bitcoin work.  I think the most important points are that 
 - it has diverged from core by 50k lines of code .... of that segwit is only 5k.   
 -  it has not been tested on a test network
 - it has no 75% signalling mechanism for activation
Those 3 points say to enough me that they are not being responsible developers.   45K LOC is a massive change.  Arguing the merits of their code without testing or an activation threshold is like writing a letter with a banana.  Certainly not impossible, but...
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:13:24
I did this twice before.  Once with about 30k of partner money and 5k of my own, and once I was a partner of someone elses network.   Both times I made money at the end  - even not counting bitcoin price increases.  But it's a lot of work, and I don't have a ton of time anymore.
 - research colocation facilities again to get the best prices
 - research asics again
 - place a big order
 - fly out to colo, or hire a local developer (i've done both... i did't bill the partners for my time though)
 - install, set up, configure equipment and firewall 
 - tear down, warehouse and sell off components after profitability declines (usually 6 months later)
It's not hard.  I probably wouldn't do it unless it was like $30-$80k of my own and $300k-$1m for partners.   Because then it might actually make a difference.
Also, both times, a large portion of the profits involved selling unprofitable equipment to hobbyists on ebay - not a really fun part of the business.

There are no capacity problems. Bitcoin has a fee market created by a capacity limit. This is a feature that protects the long -term security of the chain. Core has proposed an upgrade that will allow Bitcoin to scale without altering the fee market for large value transactions significantly.
Indeed, Bitcoin would be much better off if fees were higher for large value tx. You can figure out why trivially.
But fees, because they affect the poorest members the most, are a populist issue. A group of miners is trying to use this populist issue to take over control of the source code and the protocol.
This same group has said they might also change the monetary policy.
There is no future for Bitcoin under the auspices of this group.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:25:17
BU is not a block size increase.   It could even be a decrease.   BU says that miners *have* to collude, out of band, to control block size.   Indeed, it encouraged collusion in the protocol specification.   It is the worst possible solution to scaling.   Extension blocks ... where people send to addresses that support larger blocks, and old nodes/miners don't enforce those blocks or addresses - but allow them, are trivial... scale instantly and can be done as a soft fork (not backward breaking).

UTXO hashes that are validated by all nodes and for sufficient depth are as nearly reliable as a genesis block.   And a side chain can run by pruning to a one month old UTXO.   A new node can come online with a one month old UTXO, validate the chain since then.   It's far better than SPV.   After all, the genesis block is nothing more than an "assumed-true" UTXO of zero.
I'm not sure this is the same as a UTXO commitment.

It relys on users choosing to run it.   As long as all the major exchanges and wallets run it, then it's as good as done.   Miners can't stop the economic majority of users from upgrading their software.   For example, if I run a full node that supports a UASF, then I can immediately begin to send segwit transactions.   Older (un-upgraded) nodes would not be able to spend my outputs, because segwit protects against this with an invalid script.    New nodes could, however.   Old miners can mine old blocks on top, and not break a thing.   New miners will actually do validation.    It's possible for the chain to fork (it will fork), but as long as the economic majority of nodes are running the UASF - it's safe.   
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:03:21
You'll have to import your private key, but you might be able to use this script:    Even without RBF implemented, you can double-spend and get the later, higher-fee transaction confirmed instead.   The longer your conf time, the easier to implement a double-spend.

The question is whether you want to *invalidate* old behavior or not.   If the new feature is *useful* it should be in a soft fork.   Larger blocks?   Soft fork.   Flex-trans?   Soft fork.

Miners cannot, now, trivially collude to lower block sizes and inflate fees without attacking the network and orphaning dissenting miner blocks.   
Miners in China can, and do, mine very large blocks - knowing they are physically close to 51% of the hash power.   By mining 0 byte blocks for speed (they do this), and mining a very large block to collude...(more likely to orphan a western miners) ... they can maximize revenue.    
Larger blocks increase this problem.   Any algo that uses fees to decide on block sizes is also subject to gaming.

Lightning - with and without malleability - allows you outsource in a way that does not require any trust in the other party (either the channel or the recipient).   
Segwit doesn't change this a bit... it just makes the code less complicated and more likely to have an Android version sooner than later.
The worst a channel can do to a partner is a premature close (you lose fees).   
In fact, Segwit allows something called "chained atomic swaps" to be executed in real time... what that means is that you can have a full-0on bitcoin exchange... and you own the keys the whole time... only pay when you close the channel.
That basically ends the MtGox/Bitfinex problem.

The way bitcoin works, each user has some coins protected by a node.   So you can spin up lots of "malicious nodes", but unless these nodes obey the protocol, they will exist on their own, separate, network.   
The only way to stop bitcoin is to convince users install your malicious software.
UASF is interesting because if users install it, they will be, effectively, installing "their own malicious software".  If the economic majority installs UASF, then miners will not be able to sell their coins on exchanges who won't recognize the block rewards.
If successful, on Nov 15, core users who did not install UASF, but do have "normal segwit" will get "sucked in" and will start agreeing with the UASF.   If it's a failure, it will be clear right away that mining UASF blocks is a losing proposition.
No question it will be a chain split.   And some exchanges might choose to list UASF coin and Bitcoin separately.   But if 90% of the exchanges *don't* do this (it's very very hard to do right!), and choose to list the UASF coins as the correct coin... then you've got 2 bitcoin chains to mine against as a miner.

The 2MB HF will come 3 months after segwit is released.   And not sooner.   Core is 100% on board with doing what they said they would do.   LukeJr can be reigned in on his smaller-is-better agenda.   New version of core sync's 40% faster, so that removes a large part of the objection.   Compact blocks clean up a lot of objection too.   
Segwit followed by 2MB non-witness is the plan.   Show me segwit.... get your hard fork in core.

A one-time chain split is preferable to a protocol that can fail to converge all the time, effectively prevents the block size from increasing, and prevents off-chain swaps, scaling and layer 2 solutions that will grow Bitcoin into a household name.

That's false.   Those miners are attempting to coopt the code base, and the protocol.   They are effectively preventing a block size increase.   Nothing in BU guarantees a block size increase.   
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:19:30
Miners can decide what transactions go in a block.   The "attack" is mining a longer chain, withholding it and then releasing it... forcing other miners to reorg on the new chain... which has 0tx and rolls back all tx that were previously confirmed.   If you can make 1-conf and 2-conf unreliable, that really makes the other chain harder to use.   
As a miner you can profit from doing this attack - selling the block rewards on the market.   And other miners will lose out on their rewards/waste hashpower.   
If one chain has 75%, it can afford to spend 25% of it's hashpower attacking the minority chain, and causing massive reorgs, orphans to miners.    The 25% chain will swiftly become useless, expensive to mine and no longer viable.  
So a POW change is needed in the event of a miner attack on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-28 18:18:43
They make more money that way.   Miner incentives are not aligned with users properly in Bitcoin.   Ideally, miners can keep slowly raising fees, and taking more for themselves.   Any drop in price is offset with the extra fees.    Fees right now are 12% of miner revenue.   If the politics are this bad over 12%... imagine how they will be when fees are 100%?   Miners will do everything they can to prevent a block size increase.... forever.   
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:03:53
You didn't answer the question.   Segwit is a well tested block upgrade, and UASF is a mechanism for activating it without needing miners involved.   Indeed, miners have *no say* over the protocol.   They never have and they never will.  Miners *only* get paid to order transactions and prevent double-spends.   That's it.
Some pool operators  are trying to stop the block size from increasing so they can collect more fees.   Segwit allows super-cheap off-chain transactions, and doubles the amount of on-chain transactions.   Segwit also encourages slower utxo growth... which is really important.
The thing is, pool operators have a lot of influence.   Miners listen to them.  So they can keep raking in the cash as long as segwit doesn't activate.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:05:13

As you said, a populist argument is one that *seeks* to represent ordinary people.   They rarely, if ever, do.   In this case, populism will result in a Bitcoin ledger that cannot be validated by an ordinary person, and a money supply that will have to inflate to reward miners because of their multi-PB full node server farms, and the average user having to trust some full node provider ... because nobody except rich companies can run a blockchain.
The idea of having to record every $2 transaction on the planet in an infinitely growing immutable ledger is so outlandishly laughable, I have a hard time understanding why anyone takes BU seriously.   
Layer 2 solutions are the only proper way to scale bitcoin.   Even a simple trustless side chain checkpointed to the main chain with a UTXO hash could handle 1000tps with no blockchain bloat and Bitcoin remaining a trustless protocol.
Most users seem to understand that a 4MB/2.1MB segwit chain is the best possible move now... because you can see most full nodes have upgraded in-place to support segwit.   Which is a good thing.   Eventually those users will fork Chinacoin into a separate chain... which is also totally fine.   I'm sure both will have value over time.
The best way to scale Bitcoin, IMO, would be to break it up into multiple chains... where smaller faster chains are cheaper to mine, and larger, slower chains are more expensive... with the smallest chains check-pointed to their parents, etc.    
That way the more money you move, the more fees you pay, and the more security you get from higher hash power.   That actually makes sense.   BU makes no sense at all.

Users, exchanges and wallet holders *are* the only ones that give actual value to those bitcoins you mine.   You can sell them and pay for electricity because of that value.    Bitcoin protocol has always been decided by the users... not the miners.   Miners have never been able to tell full nodes what to validate.   BU changes this... and gives miners protocol-changing power *over* full nodes.  
Bitcoin is a delicate balance of power.   BU breaks that, and node operators aren't so foolish as to install it.   There is a reason that no major exchange has installed BU.   Even if 75% of miners mine BU, you will never be able to sell your BU coin, and my full node will reject the BU transactions.

Any algorithm that uses the fees in transactions and the fees in blocks and the "fullness" of blocks is trivially game-able by miners.    Mempool stats are better, but only if the mempool is "mostly full".   Bitcoin functions best at 80-95% full blocks.   
At &gt;100% all day long, fees hockey-stick and Bitcoin is broken. If segwit was live now, it would be working perfectly.

0 conf transactions are the exact same as rbf transactions.   they provide likelihood of security, based on prior confirmation measurements.   once my regression predicted risk is below, say, 1%, then i can move forward.  rbf doesn't break this, it just might make the curve a bit steeper.  if you send an rbf, the likelihood of confirmation might be lower, and your 0 conf code will need to calculate two curves.   rbf doesn't break a damn thing, and doesnt allow double-spends --- unless you count double spending 0 confirms - which was always allowed.   think about it.

+1 I agree:
1.  BU is crappy, complex and experimental code and everyone "signalling" for it is just running core 0.12 with the version string changed.  (It belongs on a testnet, and if it works super awesomely and simulations show it doesn't damage the network, we can do a safe, scheduled, user-activated version of EC as a pull req to core.)

My point is:   the only reason miners *cant* steal bitcoin is because nodes ... user nodes *validate* the blocks.   So if my node sees a transaction that *steals* ... my personal node *ignores* it because it's *invalid*.   
Miners do not need to validate blocks... that is not a service they provide.   Indeed, validating transactions is just a waste of miner time... except that if a single transaction is valid... the *nodes* will reject it.  They do it because they have to under threat of rejection.
That's how Bitcoin works.   Miners have very little power... user nodes have all the power.   Bitcoin Unlimited wants to undermine that to some extent - removing the power of block size validation from users and placing it in the hands of miners who can then grow blocks to arbitrarily larger sizes... or prevent users from allowing larger blocks forever... at their own whims.
If enough miners collude to grow block sizes to 100MB, then most users will no longer be able to validate at all.   They will have to simply trust that miners aren't lying.   At that point, what the hell does Bitcoin even mean?

No one is trying to sneak them in or tack them on.   But if you *wanted* larger blocks, my point was that voting for the well reviewed 8MB version - a 75% controlled fork - is *far* more responsible than mining 51% attack on the main chain, which is essentially what BU proposes.   Bu has *no* activation threshold.
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:31:19
95% switch is definitely successful .   51% switch is definely fail.   Everything in between is grey

Miners, ideally, want to squeeze us for fees for as long as they can.   I don't see them raising block sizes until absolutely necessary.   And who's to say what's necessary?  Certainly not users: BU takes investors, users out of the equation.   BU also blocks segwit, the most imnportant network upgrade Bitcoin has seen in many years.   Did you see what Trezor said about it?
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:55:37
Yep.    The whitepaper clearly makes the distinction between "honest nodes" and "dishonest nodes".   And the protocol blackholes nodes that are dishonest.   BU is a dishonest fork... attempting to prevent a *bug fix* and lying about wanting a block size increase.   I hope the whitepaper is right, and honest nodes will prevail.

When segwit was first announced, Bitcoin Classic was the leading hardfork proposal.   They moved the goalposts right after that.   They will keep moving the goalposts until they control both the software *and* the the mining.

1. No because Clams are a set of nodes that have little/no value
2. Not if that network has little/no value
If you created a network that had significant competitive value, then yes.   
If Bitcoin Unlimited achieved 51% of mining power: there would be two directly competing forked networks... with significant losses of perceived value of the combined whole.
If UASF is activated, and only 45% of mining power follows: there would be two directly competing forked networks... with significant losses of perceived value of the combined whole.
The Winklevoss twins and Roger Ver and a number of others have come down strongly in favor of mining power vs core, so there would be significant financial backing for the majority hash-power network - even if that network doesn't have the majority of nodes.  
The resulting network split could sunder the value proposition of Bitcoin both as a store of value and as a currency.
I'd send you my "Ver coins" in exchange for your "Core coins" though.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:32:11
Every analysis shows that fees "hockeystick" when blocks get full.  At 95% full, the fee market is strong and stable, but at 100% full, they grow exponentially.    Even a very, very small block size increase today... like 25% would probably drop fees down to 25 cents.   Miners know this.
Segwit forces miners to accept a block size increase today.   They will lose a ton of cash... in a low margin business it could be as much as 50% of their profits to miners willing to mine lower fee tx.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:16:31
I think he was probably wrong about not needing a second layer.  There's a reason why all existing financial systems use layered settlement.  Even databases have settlement layers.  And even microchips do.   
Bitcoin  without layers is bad technology.
DASH has layer 2 baked in to the protocol.  
Bitcoin's solution is smarter.  Keep the core protocol clean, and allow layer 2 solutions to compete.

The code isn't that messy.   It's 90% tests and comments.   It's really not that bad.  People just use random arguments against it, because they a) don't want a malleability fix or b) don't want a block size increase.   Fees are now 10-12% of a miners income.   That's big.   And segwit might hurt that by lowering fees.   BU prevents a block size increase until miners "agree" on it.... which is totally B.S.   
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:23:55
BU is an attack on segwit.   It is not about block size.  If you think it is, you're an idiot.  All the BU miners are mining 1 MB, signalling 1MB., and running core.... without segwit.

This was the agreement miners agreed to.   2MB non witness + segwit.   BU is clearly a poison pill.   Core 0.13.2 is 1MB non-witness and a violation of the agreement.

So you like exchange hacks?   Mt Gox?   Bitfinex?   How many of those have to happen before we need a real layer 2 solution?   If I could choose between lower fees and fixing exchange hacks, I would choose the latter every time.  Fortunately, segwit gets us both.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:32:49
Clearly you don't understand how mining works. The more Bitcoins price goes up the more people become Miners and the more the reward is divided. This is not true for pool fees, pool tx fees are an incredible source of R

4.2gb/month isn't very much.   i got a 300gb vps for $5/month, and i run core, testnet, and a side chain on it with no speed issues.  my hd at home on my shitty laptop has 1 TB.   no way talking about the size of the blockchain will scare anyone.   the only issue is the time to start up a new node... that's a killer as the blockchain grows.   If core shipped with a UTXO set and a new "genesis" every year or so, the chain would never grow large.    It could even be an "opt-in" thing.
This, of course, would allow a malicious actor within core to ship a version that changes balances, etc... but that's a problem already today.  Gitian doesn't get you /that/ much.

Miners can kill the UASF by simply killing segwit transactions.   Cost them nothing.   UASF won't work if miners actively fight against it.   The main chain will just grow without segiwt transactions at all.   If miners want to stop segwit... they can.

Chain need not split.   Old un-upgraded miners will still be mining the main chain... just not validating.   It's 100% backward compat.    No risk unless a miner chooses to *actively* attack the main chain.    Very few miners would choose to stab themselves like this.   It would require rewriting the code to specifically attack the fork and lose money (fees, not reward) on purpose.   A pool operator attacking the new features this way would be instantly villified, and miners would leave quickly.   UASF does not force anyone to upgrade, and does not force anyone to even use it!

B.S.   people talk about BU all the time.    I posted recently about a simple proposal that would make BU acceptable to core.   Theymos agreed with it and replied.   r/btc is NOT necessary.    
BU peeps seem uninterested in constructive conversation with core... so they fork their own sub, build a poison pill version of bitcoin that will never be run on any major exchanges, and foment conspiracy theory about "blockchain core".
If BU devs *weren't* poison pill creators, they would simply a) modify default AD to -1 (never), b) modify default AB/EB to 1 and 2 (in accordance with HK agreement) and c) submit a f'ing pull request to core.
Then *users* could decide to hard fork ANY TIME THEY WANTED TO.   And they could do so safely, and with miner support.

The years when there was hardly anyone using it, yeah.   Now that Bitcoin is popular, we have to code to the real limits of p2p networks, and a potentially infinite blockchain.   If BTC were to handle visa-level transactions, for only 2 years, the blockchain would be 32TB, and it would take a new fully validating node over a year to come online.
As it is, it took me a week to come online with a full node.   Did you ever try installing one... it's quite sobering.   It's really easy to do.
And how much would that popularity help bitcoin, as a whole?   Price would go up a bit... but maybe even not that much... how many users are really turned off by 50 cent fees?    Fees right now are artificially inflated by Bitcoin Unlimited anyway.
I'd bet we'd go down to 0.10 per tx if BU disappeared today.   Which is, of course, why BU exists... to keep BU pools rolling in extra cash.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:14:14
Of course it will.   Do you seriously think any protocol can handle the world's micro-transactions on an infinitely growing immutable ledger?
Fees will go to $25 when bitcoin hits $50K.  Bitcoin will, at that point, be a distributed settlement framework/clearing house for moving large-value transactions.   Layer 2 chains and networks that are equally distributed and trustless will handle transactions less than $5000.   That is a natural evolution.
If you decide, instead to grow the blockchain to handle a $50K bitcoin, then you wind up with a 1TB/week blockchain that can only be run in large data warehouses by wealthy companies.   Also, since the fee markets must remain low for liquidity, an inflation rate will have to be imposed.   
Meaning the average person will have to trust big banks and corporations not to cheat, double-spend, and control the monetary rates.   
Nice thing is that Layer 2 solutions... even a simple side-chain, can handle an infinitely growing number of transactions.   Which is super cool, remains trustless and fragmented so that no single entity can stop Bitcoin.

I think r/btc, in general, has had more vitriol and less substance than r/bitcoin.   
I frequently post the same articles on both, just to see how people respond.   Recently, I posted a user-configurable block size scaling proposal that used a 95% consensus signalling mechanism and 1 year release schedule.   Essentially, much like BU, but without any of the things that make BU incredibly dangerous.   
On r/bitcoin, this was 65% upvoted.   On r/btc it was quietly (few comments) downvoted to 30%.
Also, in the bitcoin dev forum I got feedback that allowed me to add detail to the proposal.  
Essentially, I have proven, to myself at least, that r/btc is *entirely* an echo chamber, and r/bitcoin is *substantially less so*.   
Indeed, it appears ( to me ), that r/btc is a front for an attack on Bitcoin's source base seemingly designed to put control over the source code in the hands of some mining pools.   The hostility over at r/bitcoin seems to stem, largely, from this perceived attack.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:51:47
If EC ever happens we will need 12 confirms, instead of 6.   Which sucks.   
A minor adjustment to EC can make it stable:  
Size adjustments are timed after signalling period using the 5th percentile largest increase (or smallest in the case of downward adjustments).   And size adjustments have a 2 month lock in (or longer whatever... just need to agree on a lock-in time... oh no need to agree on something in the code, and not have miners vote on it... nevermind).
So you never have the 50/50 case, or even the 75% case.  You have 95% consensus every time, and nobody ever gets forked off the network, unless they 1. have a crazy EB/AD that's incredibly out of line. and 2. they ignore the network change for 2 months.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:27:06
Yep, because they aren't thinking about what segwit means in the long run.   Segwit : doubles fee income with a block size increase, incentivises bitcoin as a settlement network... and allows bitcoin to grow more popular than bitcoin without segwit.   This, in turn will cause a massive increase in mining fees.

It actually completely solves the problem.     You have to think about it a little longer.   
What happens if fees go to $3?   Remember, with full blocks, all of the fee increases come because of price increases.  At $3 fees, bitcoin prices will be $5000!   
Then people don't use Bitcoin for $10 transactions anymore.   They use it more like an ATM ... replacing a bank account.   
So, layer 2 solutions will be needed for coffee purchases at this point.  Side chains can replace cheap-fast transactions.   And side chains are less secure but that's OK, because they are fast and cheap.
Bitcoin has a problem where high-value transactions pay the *same fee* as low value transactions.
But with side-chains, this problem goes away.  Now people can transact on the network with the appropriate speed and security features.   And each side network is checkpointed back to the main chain... so we can trust it.   And they are merge-mined, so miners get all the fees.
This allows the main chain fees to go to $10, and the price to $10,000.   
But everyone can own "side chain bitcoin "... which are commitments, and fractions of bitcoins security, but are at least checkpointed coins that work well enough.   People with more than $20k or so will probable move their side coins to the main chain... if they want the additional security.  I would do it!
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:30:14
Miners can kill the UASF by simply killing segwit transactions.   Cost them nothing.   UASF won't work if miners actively fight against it.   The main chain will just grow without segiwt transactions at all.   If miners want to stop segwit... they can.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:41:51
Seriously?  You want to wreck an entire ecosystem using 50k lines of untested code.... so dirt farmers in africa won't have to submit transactions using a lightning node?  You want people to believe that?     
Segwit lets *anyone* own and transact bitcoin commitments for pennies.   And it moves all those pennies to miners... so miners get to make a LOT more money with segwit than they do with a broken massive petabyte ledger.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:40:50
But *I* can run an LN.   And I can benefit from it.   Mining is hard now.   It's like saying by preventing buses we can increase the tolls on roads.   If people can't afford the fee... they won't use Bitcoin.   Segwit allows fees to no longer be a bottleneck.   Obviously we cannot grow on-chain transactions to handle commerce.   Bitcoin has a 30 minutes to wait for enough confirms.   It's not even remotely useful for point to point transactions, and was never intended to be.

nVersion is in the thing that you mined, so yeah, that miners block would be lost.    anyone running an *old* node might thing it was real though, so the network would fork at that point... where some nodes and miners that were not upgraded would be on one network and some would be on another.   
as long as all the exchanges and wallets and around half the miners have that code... then everything will work fine.   if exchanges and wallets verbally support, install and maintain that code... then we're done, the network will upgrade smoothly.
i think a fork would be good for bitcoin.   we need to move the "big block" group off onto its own chain.   i think it will be great to own both too.  Owning ETH and ETC worked out for me.   BTC/BTU will too.

If you get knocked offline for a long time, channel partners can steal funds by broadcasting an old version of the channel, and waiting for the timeout.  
Also, you have to secure the nonces very well, but these are being constantly loaded into RAM by your software.... so there's no hardware signature layer you can build, like Trezor.
For large-value transactions, LN is not appropriate.   If I got $100k in an LN transaction I would close the channel and wait for clearance before accepting it.
LN is layer-2 in every sense of the word.   Lower security in exchange for lower fees.

3. Also, I think even a 4% change to the status quo could steer things.   Once major pools see miners switching away from them (i no longer use eligius, because it is not signalling!), pool operators will hustle to upgrade.

What fantasy are you living in that hashpower is more important than following the rules?
Even if all the miners in the world colluded they cannot steal my bitcoins.   That's how bitcoin works.   The only thing miners do is decide which transactions get into blocks.   They can't steal, or print more coins or do anything else.
If we change the rules to allow them to collude on block size and fix the fee market... what else can they collude on.

The conclusion of the article is that you need government to regulate money.  And this is probably true.  But, there is no "magic" to "government" beyond the consensus of its participants.  
Yes, you cannot engineer past government.   
But, bitcoin *is* a government - the code is its constitution, programmers are it's representatives, and when you install a version of Bitcoin you are casting your vote.
Governments often don't survive transitions of power.  When (if?) Bitcoin survives its first hard fork, its first election, it will have been proven to be as strong as any democracy.

"If a majority of (hash) power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains"
There's the distinction.  How can a group of people seeking, primarily, to persist a malleability bug be seen as "honest nodes"?   They are not.
"If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more (hash) power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.
Again... the idea is that miner will eventually come around to being honest... rather than trying to steal from users... whcih is basically the proposal set forth by BU.   
BU's proposal is this:  "At all costs, we want to control how you move funds.   Malleability prevents you from using other mechanisms, so we well prevent you from fixing that.   In addition we want to control the source code so that we can prevent you from moving funds without using our mining equipment."
And the worst part is... this will *decrease* mining revenue.   They only think they are acting in their own interests.      But they are shooting themselves in the foot.

99.9 percent of tx occur off chain in unsecured IOU's on exchanges.  
Breeze wallet allows off -chain tx via Tumblebit.
Payment channel fees aggregate and must be eventually cleared on chain.
Soft forks can be used to create extension block addresses and grow blockchain to an arbitrary size. Fully backward compatibile.
Segwit allows exchanges to give users control over their Bitcoin. So now you won't have those hacks anymore.

Unfortunately there's no way that a blockchain can store enough information to handle microtransactions. But fortunately some very clever people have invented a way for microtransactions to leverage Bitcoins system. Payment channels are brilliant.

Hard forks break old nodes, old hardware, hardware wallets, older versions of things everywhere in the system.   Hard forks invalidate old scripts stealing people's money.

If block sizes were based on median + 1.05% then fees would be less volatile, but still very strong.... and block sizes could organically shrink if lightning network works out.

Yeah, but it's not in the best interests of network quality because the interests of the miners are *not* always in the best interests of the network.   So the idea that we can trust them to safeguard anything besides double spends is *fundamentally flawed*.  We cannot.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:04:14
which is why bitcoin, as a protocol, needs full blocks... every block.   Which is why a pre-negotiated guaranteed fee, rather than a race-condition based fee might work better.   
Just like difficulty adjusts every two weeks, minimum fees could adjust to 10th percentiles every week... allowing blocks to be more predictable, and preventing spam from being broadcast at all.   It would free up the network a lot  - and present a much better user experience.   With such a system, only if a miner controlled 90% of the network could the fees be artificially raised.
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:46:54
After verifying a sufficient number of blocks any node can be reasonably certain that the expense of forging the blocks is greater than any a calculated amount of damage.   
Indeed, you can calculate the maximum possible damage, and the total reward forgone and ensure that one is an order of magnitude greater.   
IE:  If someone would have earned 10 times more mining the main chain than the maximum possible forgery, you can be reasonably assured that they did not forge your chain.
This is an idea/work in progress, so any criticism is welcome!   I really like the idea of calculating the "forgone reward cost" to evaluate whether a sequence of PoW verified blocks is a correct sequence.
One of the challenges is to compute the *minimum* PoW acceptable in an unrooted chain which can be done with a peak-regression analysis.   
The only way such a node could be fooled is if the main chain difficulty spikes far beyond 
your regression estimate, and someone uses their spare ASIC cycles.   But still 5 months of blocks would be an incredible chain to forge for a typical small-value block.
Indeed, such a partially-validating node would not be capable of relaying blocks, or confirming transactions that contain value transfers greater than a very conservative (order of magnitude) reward*depth estimates.   
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:30:49
3) If all of the exchanges and users are on the minority chain, miners will have to scramble to start mining that chain... or they will be mining worthless blocks that don't validate.    Minority miners will ignore those blocks too...never building on that split chain.   So miners get screwed... and have to jump ship fast.   I expect this is what will happen.

There is absolutely no functional difference between a 0 conf and and RBF transaction, except that the software you use to calculate likelihood of confirmation will have to maintain two likelihoods.   My guess is that the biggest use case will be "change a fee" and possibly "cancel a bad transaction".   Therefore the 0-conf time on an RBF will be longer, because the likelihood curve will be steeper.   But probably not more than say, a few seconds longer.   But it might be long enough that people with walking wallets won't want to use them.    Whatever, so your wallet lets you choose between "fast" mode and "advanced" mode.

If everyone is signalling EB1, then no larger blocks will be mined, since someone would have to mine larger blocks 6 blocks in a row... with potential orphans, in order for the larger blocks to be accepted.   That's a $100k gamble nobody will take.
Some miners are resisting *any* block size increase... BU just takes away users ability to coerce them into accepting a larger size or get priced out by miners that do.
If BU passes 50%, I fully expect that block sizes will stay the same for a very long time.   XT and Classic were real block size increases.  BU is just a weird thing with unpredictable behavior.

Almost all layer 2 solutions benefit from segwit.   A high quality side chains - an on-chain solution in many senses - would also work better and be more secure with segwit because of the way it solves tx  malleability.   I would hope that Bitcoin does not scale too much on chain, eventually has fees like $25, and is unbelievable secure and almost entirely used to drive Layer 2 commitments.   
It makes no sense to provide the same security for a $1Bil money move as a $1 money move.
At that point, most people will only own Layer 2 Bitcoin commitments... not actual Bitcoins.   Which is fine.

 - Yes, if fees are acceptable to the economic majority - no one will change the defaults.   Personally, I don't care if fees go to $1.   But if I notice a lot of people I personally know are switching to a 2MB accept rate, then I'd move my full nodes too, and leave my miners at 1MB for a long time.
 
 - Node "counting" has *nothing* to do with this proposal.  I'ts more about personal decisions and network effects.  I should not have used the word 90%
 - It will never be worse than a hard fork, and not even worse than a failed soft fork (which is worse, IMO for perception).   And will be very, very infrequent... maybe once every few years as fee pressure builds.   
Thing is, it will move the *politics* of block size away from core and out to nodes and miners.   Which is VERY important, IMO.   Political fragmentation will happen over and over unless something is done.
It's also an uncontroversial move.   I mean, who can possibly object to letting nodes *and* miners decide block size... they already do anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:29:04
If blocks are large enough, fees drop incredibly. Miners with better connectivity and with proximity to each other in physical space have larger and larger advantages. They have every incentive to make blocks extremely large, broadcast them to each other, and collude.
Average users will not be able to store even a 50tps chain.  And bootstrapping a new node now takes a week.  At 50tps, it could take months for.a new user to get online.  So they will have to trust someone else.   And ..... now you've broken the whole purpose of bitcoin.
Now imagine a 2 layer solution.  Average users can still store the chain, and they can run they're own channel nodes.  No trust 8s required to ensure the network....it can all be verified by a typical user.  Indeed, a typical user can be a part of a 100ktps system.  The system has fewer connections, so the bandwidth requirements are lower, and because the network is organically sharded, you have no scaling issues.
This is the the correct path.  Satoshi just didn't see this far ahead.

Core builds it into a soft fork, and he says ... no I will vote instead on BU... a proposal that allows me to choose whatever the fuck size I want and changes the Bitcoin protocol completely... removing nodes from the equation of validation.   
Nodes under BU are designed to *accept* blocks whatever the fuck they contain under BU, as long as they pass an "Accept Depth"  conveniently expressed as an obscure number that no one will touch.   BU is a poison pill and a deliberate attack on the protocol making miners the kings of bitcoin, instead of the partners of users, exchanges and wallets.  No major exchange has installed BU.

As a blocksize increase, BU, which doesn't change the size at all, is even less satisfying.
BU developers are naive in thinking that their code is popular among miners because it's a block size increase.
XT/Classic failed because big pools would lose money if they happened.   
BU allows big pools to prevent a block size increase forever.  So it's the perfect storm:  A bunch of clueless developers thinking their code is popular because it's going to lower fees.  
A bunch of pools probably running core but signalling for BU - because it keeps fees high.
I don't think this is a double-fake.   I think BU developers sincerely think they are building a larger block version of Bitcoin.   
I think pool operators latched onto this as a way of preventing segwit activation.
All the evidence I needed was when the BU bug happened and not a single pool has a blip in the block production.

You can't.   Economic majoirty ... while real, cannot be measured.   And even more important is the amount of fiat an investor is planning to spend over the next year... behind a node.   And that is impossible to measure.
But what you can do is look at strong commitments from major exchanges and businesses.   If 90% of them are "on the side" of something... then it doesn't matter what the hashpower says.
Remember, it would be trivial to make a coin that allows miners to change balances.   And they could probably trick/convince people to support it ("a new blockchain, much smaller and faster, and hashpower to secure it!").   
But would this be bitcoin?

No, I meant signing the (usually the hash of) public key with the private key corresponding to the public.  This is a non-interactive proof of knowledge of secret key.   Pretty standard.   Yes it makes keys bigger.   But its challenging to produce a protocol without KOSK sigs that is robust, in all situations, to a rogue key attack *and* supports M of N public keys.

Even a casual analysis shows that the network has been constantly and regularly spammed since March 2016.   As fees rise, it's cheaper to spam... since you can be sure your tx won't clear, and will expire from mempool.

On capacity: as the need to send larger amounts grows, the need to use lightning diminishes.   $1000 can be sent with BTC, even with high fees of $10, that's fine.    Hopefully, lightning capacity will grow faster than BTC fees.   IT seems to be growing rapidly so far, with better connectivity.  [  
On cold storage:  this is really related to the "production ready" part.    While I don't doubt a malware or 0 day attack on hardware could grab a hot wallet, remote exploits inside the lightning protocol itself are my primary concern.   Once these are resolved, a multisig lightning wallet should be far safer than a banking app.
On routing:   As both capacity and protocol improve, routing has also improved, and there's no reason to think this won't continue.    Here's a great overview of "the routing issue":  [ .   Lightning's protocol, as is, should scale to millions of users, and the topology seems to be growing rapidly ahead of this goal.
   
Short list of improvements that are slated for 2019 or early 2020:
 
**Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP)**: This will improve the UX around payment routing along with liquidity in the [Lightning Network](
**Splicing**: Increasing the capacity of a channel or taking money on-chain is a time consuming process and requires closing a channel. By cutting the middleman, splicing will allow users to coordinate an on-chain transaction to add or remove funds from a channel.
**Wumbology**: Currently, the channel size limit of LN is 0.16 BTC and 0.04 BTC payment limit. This proposal will bring [greater liquidity]( to the network as channel capacities increase which represents a big step in the network’s maturity.
**Sphinx-send**: Sphinx constructed routes will allow the identity of a seller to be obscure and will further allow Lightning to work without having recipients requesting invoices
**Watchtowers**: Watchtowers, that will be run and operated by third parties will provide an additional guarantee that users aren’t being cheated by their counterparties.

1. if i can send coin, securely, to btc for a service... that makes a big difference.  We need a "venmo" or "paypal" for bitcoin.   I need to be able to send coin to someone *that doesn't havbe a wallet". It's pretty critical.
2. A DNSSEC lookup on an email address can give me the pubkey for verifying a signed pubseed to send payments.

I like to wait for first conf before shipping stuff.... at 20 minutes, I can miss fedex cutoff times for last minute orders.   It's still better than Visa though... where my fraud rates were 10% or more!  With BTC I have 0 fraud after 1 conf.   I have gotten a double-spend attempt.

I don't think their analysis of a) the expense of blockchain, or b) the true cost of bitcoin transfers is inaccurate.  Indeed, Bitcoin's core value may merely be as a digital gold surrogate.   Blockchain is a secure, but comparatively very expensive way to move money.
This is why the people who give a crap about the 2MB hard fork are completely clueless.
They are trying to turn blockchain into something it isn't: a payments system.
That being said... lightning network will end them.
It's a bulk settlement system and a store of value akin to gold.   And for this, it seems to work so far.   And it works well as a layer... but not as the final solution, in the remittances game.

When transactions are near capacity, Bitcoin's utility is vulnerable to large hashrate decreases.   Any decrease results in a throughput problem until then next retarget.   When txns are *not* near capacity, this is a non-issue.

Segwit seems like it will be in 0.13.1, which could release in Aug, with with activation in Nov.   But it's a big change, so it might take some time.   It will effectively 1.8x the limit, which will keep fees about where they are until the next limit improvement -  which may not be a block size increase.   There are lots of things that can be done to avoid a block size increase while increasing throughput.   A hard fork is OK... but they are tricky to manage.   What's the time limit?   What percent?   Etc.   Everyone thinks its super easy... just change the limit.  But it's not really.

Um, yes I am.  I built my own boxes back when GPU mining was a thing.   These days I usually sell to the highest bidder with tools like Nicehash... letting the network with the highest value dictate where my hashpower goes.   Most professional miners do stuff like this.   Very little consideration... ever... is given to what transactions you're including, or even really how the software works.
It was only until after I'd accumulated wealth that I started worrying about the protcol.   How to secure my keys.
As I miner I was just trying to cover the cost of the box and not feel screwed over by the supplier.  I wind up making money when I sell them on ebay ... so I did better than break-even.

How much can on-chain scale realistically?   All tx are sent to all nodes!   IF you multiple tx by 10 nodes cant even validate them fast enough, and network issues cause orphans like crazy.
Lightning scales to 10Ktps easily.   Even if you share some fees with L nodes, that's massive fee improvements.   Massive.   There is simply no comparison.
Miners are looking at the short term... thinkings OMG, hubs take fees!.   But those hubs *have to settle on the main chain*.   And settlements are bigger, and can handle higher fees.   Fees can go to $25, and $50k per bitcoin and all sorts of shit with LN.

I don't think it's being ignored.   I think the Bitcoin community doesn't really understand what a fork is, and why centralization happens, etc.   Bitcoin could fork right now ... into two version, and everyone would own twice as many coins ... each worth less, each mined on another fork.   
What matters is what nodes do the exchanges list?   If I were an exchange operator, I'd list both... and let the market decide which fork is more valuable.      I could see exchanges in china siding with the chinese miners.  I could even see 2 coins emerge... one US coin and one Chinese.

If 20% of the miners leave, bitcoin will slow down (blocks/sec) by about 20% for average 8.4 days (7 day avg diff retarget * 1.2 slowdown).   This slowdown will exaggerate the backlog, mempool issues for those 8.4 days (which is already pretty high).   Then it will go back to normal.   I would only consider it a catastrophe if 50% or more of the miners shut down.... leaving difficulty incredibly high, blocks incredibly slow, and the system failing for weeks.

Signing a public-key is sufficient to prevent a rogue key attack.    Verification of signature is it's not a complex thing, and what is harmful is your continued an unsubstantiated claims that those things are difficult.
A 2 of 3 key, with one in a vault is far simpler than degrading wallet schemes.


There are so many threshold Schnorr sigs out there, it's hard to count.   And someone already implemented a nice M of N protocol: 
It's just that making a protocol super complex in order to protect from rogue key attacks... rather than simply having each party sign his public key is confusing to me.   I guess I don't see why it's so hard to verify knowledge of the private.

And that number doesn't include ETFs or coporate holdings.   There's another 10 trillion in government bonds held by coporations *specifically as a deflation or currency hedge*.   
None of this money has even poked a stick at Bitcoin yet.   If one fund so much as breathes in Bitcoin's direction, it's going to $10k in a weekend.   Bitcoin is so incredibly small right now.   The market cap is inflated by coins that aren't actively managed.

segwit does increase block size.   but "big blockers" want a HF and flex block sizes.   i suspect that to get everyone on board and 90% miner uptake, you'll need an HF with segwit + 2MB/3MB or some sort of flex cap.   basically you can't alienate *anyone* on this.   if you can get the top 3 devs on BU to switch over to core on a pull req that everyone agrees on, and core to accept that... you'll get a capacity increase.   otherwise, i'll bet that lightning network will work on litecoin years before bitcoin.

When you have a peg, you say, the ruble is worth XXX bitcoins, and then someone can walk into a bank and get bitcoins with it.   You then operate a fractional reserve.  This props up the value of the local currency.   Even a weak peg (90% below market rate) and a 5% fractional reserve (no run on banks) can vastly prop up the currency for many many years.   The problem is that when the peg exceeds the value of Bitcoin, there's a run on the banks.   So you have to re-issue new currency, with a different peg every once in a while.   It's mostly a shit show, because the country will have to re-peg all the time, and people holding old bills will drain Bitcoin reserves... but ultimately, this is not a bad thing.   
A government like Russia with a very strong currency could leverage it quite a bit....never letting the peg get above 50% and continuing to horde Bitcoin.   This reserve would grow in value so much that they could reduce or eliminate taxes, and attract foreign business.

Core devs would "go for it" if the developers of the fork participated in the IRC meetings, responded to feedback with code, incorporated changes that the rest of the developer community agrees are best practices, etc.   
There is nothing that Bitcoin core devs are opposed to more than coercion led by moneyed interests.   Look at the "bitcoin classic" pull request to core.   There were lots of objections and even ridicule.   But the amazing thing was: *none of them were insurmoutnable*.
Flextrans was only derided as *poorly coded*.   The concept was *too difficult to implement safely without a lot of time and effort*.
But was that a no?   Of course not.   It would be wonderful to have a flexible transaction format.   But implementing it correctly with extraordinarily defensive code is very hard and costly.
No core dev has ever objected to raising the block size "ever".   The objection has always been "do it gradually", and "incorporate other important changes in the fork" and "do it in a way that guarantees the inevitible minority chain dies off" and "do it in a way that ensures nlocktime tx still work", and all the *normal engineering objections* ... that are not addressed by btc1.

Miners can include un-broadcast 200 sat/byte tx all day long to fool fee estimators for no cost except for some dust they choose not to include in order to prop up fees.   This behavior is rewarded with the higher fees users pay, and only punished with less adoption of Bitcoin.

On chain scaling is not really feasable for the long term, so it makes sense to focus on other strategies.   Blockchain, as an overall technology, is monotonic, linear and scales badly.   Major changes (multi-chain tech, etc), will be needed for bitcoin to scale properly.   Fortunately segwit makes these changes easier: it makes side chains, webs, and other scaling techs much easier to implement.

Not a solution at all.   You will wind up with two coins.   Bitcoin price will split and plummet to 50% it's current value (like what happened to Ethereum).  Hard forks are intrinsically more dangerous to the immutability and stored value of the ledger.   Plus no one is supporting a 2MB hard fork now.   "BU" is the leading fork... which will hand more power to the miners, and take it away from the users.   No wonder miners are voting for it.

I helped credit card integration for about 6 porn sites.  It's actually pretty hard for these sites to retain merchant accounts and get good service.   Also their customers would prefer not to leak identity using CC's.   Every single site, however, needed subscription services, and there is no good way to do this with bitcoin, unless you use Coinbase - which is prohibited.    A simple BIP which allows a "subscription" to be set up that a customer links to a wallet would change things.   Basically the customer's wallet would have a list of subscriptions, and automatically send payments every X to a BIP47 address.   Subscriptions can be denominated in any currency and conversions are handled by the client.   Transactions are sent directly to the merchant... not published online.   Transactions are checked for correctness, and whether they are still valid.   Subscriptions can be terminated by either the merchant or the client at any time.

No, it's really less complex.   90% of the code is tests.   The only thing that's complicated is the notion of a soft fork itself.   Which has been done many times... and each time it was always complicated.   But the segwit release includes "versionbits" which makes releases less complicated in the future.   If we ever do hard fork, all the annoying stuff can be shuttled aside... supporting old tx's but only "simpler ones" in the future.   This can be done any time to clean up old soft forks like BIP68 and segwit.

That's why I promote "Approval Voting" every chance I get.   Approval voting is the simply best way to run an election.   It's a robust measure of support in the way that nonparametric stats are more robust.
Unfortunately, it is hotly opposed by those in power, because it actually gives power to the people - instead of allowing them to be trivially manipulated by plurality.
Basically it's a very simple concept... use checkboxes on voting slips and let people check off as many as they want.   That way the person you elect will be the one most people checked off.v   This prevents vote splitting and allows many candidates to run.   It's the death of two party systems.
But I'm a "libertarian green"  - someone who is opposed to big government in all forms except when protecting shared resources.   So my politics are basically anathema to just about everyone.

segwit is an incredibly simple change (don't include witness in txid).   it is made more complex because of discounts and block size increases.   getting rid of those would make it an excellent fix that works well to fix mtgox style malleability bugs.   those discounts and changes were included to pacify the "bitcoin classic" movement... effectively producing a 2mb increase (now 2.1 and growing).   but apparently that was a shifting bar... now classic devs have moved on to 32MB max blocks.

Sure it does... but it's generally a lot cheaper to do business that way.   Even if you get burned one day 20% and bumped the next by 20%, on average he's found you wind up saving so much that it's worth it.    Bitcoin is not a big part of his business yet, so it doesn't really matter.  As more people use it, the "market price" (what fiat it translates to)  becomes less important than the commodity value (what you can buy with it).   
Ultimately fiat is only useful for people who deal in fiat for the majority of their transactions.  Once that ceases to be the case your perspective radically changes - and you start pricing things in bitcoin first... fiat second.   
I will admit there are probable no more than a few hundred people on the planet for whom Bitcoin is a true reference currency.  
But for people "in the space" ... ie: asic manufacturers, it is probably more meaningful to price things in a fixed amount of coin.
I'm sure you can see that selling ASIC's for dollars is rediculous... you will have to change the price every day to keep up.   Instead you should sell it for a fixed bitcoin amount that gets adjusted as the difficulty changes.
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:26:09
See, BTC doesn't scale at all the way it is, it cannot possibly scale to being a transactional currency unless you have 1GB blocks, and all nodes have hundreds of TB of space, and are running on 1GE internet connections.  You cannot have every transaction for everyone everywhere broadcast to every node on the planet.   At some point you have to have side chains or something.   Segwit gets us to building the real solutions right away, and patches things for a year while those are developed.   
If those solutions don't ease pressure within a year, then we will have to hard fork.
I really hope that doesn't happen - because I think the network will fragment.   And that will kill Bitcoin.
When I hope is that segwit works well enough, and layer 2 weak side-chains develop immediately that allow fast, less secure, but unlimited bitcoin transactions - while checkpointing to the main chain for security.
Basically you have to choose between:
 - security
 - distribution
 - transactions speed
You can pick 2, but you can't have all 3.

Attributed in some pull request comments, yes.   Attributed in the metadata, no.   Which makes code that builds attribution - graphs like the above - harder to write.   I do no think BU peeps are deliberately misattributing.   But the prospect of maintaining a fork of something as complex as Bitcoin - with a smaller dev group - is daunting at best.   It's not surprising they take shortcuts like dumping a patch.  
Arguably, if they were a little better versed in git nuances, the commits could survive, even with metadata (merge remote, cherry-pick, etc.)
Ultimately, they are shooting themselves in the foot - because git will do an increasingly crappier job of merging as they diverge.   Properly merging in commits directly helps a lot in fork maintenance.
Personally, I think there are some very good devs in BU, and bitcoin will probably want a flexible block size in the future.  Certainly any block size increase, when it is done, should be flexible in /some/ way.   I wish those devs were submitting more pull reqs to core... setting up for the day when that's needed.

1. Propose a fork that uses a new POW, and uses node count miner difficulty as a threshold for the switch.  
2. Convince 95% of the nodes, exchanges and wallets - enough hashpower  - to support the fork.   
You could call this an altcoin, sure, and you've effectively doubled the supply (old + new coins) - but it's 100% compatible with all existing software, and if most people prefer it, the old chain will get traded down to nothing.   This is what happened with Ethereum and Ethereum classic.   And it did not "kill" the value of Ethereum - indeed, it didn't seem to harm the combined value at all.   The DAO hack killed ethereum.
But forks do work.

And then a new layer will emerge that solves the problem and some people will kick and fight and say "this isn't Bitcoin".  I fully expect this to happen with the lightning network ... like it did with Bitcoin, and I expect it to take 4-5 years instead of 8 years.

This sub is has a lot of people on it who oppose government and corporate control, and see cryptocurrency as a tool in their arsenal.   The other sub is more concerned with unmitigated growth, and would willingly sacrifice features like decentralization, fungibility and censorship resistance to achieve that goal.   The argument is that if Bitcoin gets enough adoption, then governments cannot easily oppose it.   This is true.   The counterargument is that if Bitcoin is no longer decentralized, there is no reason for the government to oppose it - it becomes another mechanism that governments can use to control people.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:47:07
*Unfortunately*, yes.    I wish it wasn't the case!
2MB ... without any code to prevent the competing chain from continuing and without any protections or other features that are needed during a fork.... makes Bitcoin vulnerable and less secure for no reason other than catering to political demands.   A 2MB fork in November is, from an engineering perspective, completely useless and hugely disruptive.   
There have been excellent and well-reviewed fork proposals in bitcoin-dev ... but I don't see 2x people working on them.   Why not *start* with spoonet and BIP103?   COOP proposal had *zero* objections... which is tacit approval in open source land.   Sw2x can be interpreted as either a takeover attempt or an attack and seemingly has little to do with improving Bitcoin.   
"Big blockers" are often associated with altcoin promoters and ICO scam promoters - because destabilizing Bitcoin is the primary result of their crusade. A 2x fork *as currently proposed* is 100% consistent with the "big blocker" movement.

Segwit: Increasing the size of your house using an extension... not a shed, a nice on-chain block extension - with a master bedroom, walk in closet and a bath.   Hardfork: building a larger house, that doesn't have any nice new features, and coordinating a move.  
The downside of segwit is that the roof doesn't match, and your grandmother (old nodes) can't walk up the stairs.   
But there's a leak in the HF house (convergence issues), but mostly that should be OK.   And the HF house has some financing issues (decentralization) that may or may not be a problem.   
The segwit house does have a doggy door too.   And you don't have a dog yet.   Maybe you should get one?

Cheap fees for bitcoin transactions.  You top up a lightning wallet for $2 to $4 or so, and can route hundreds of small-value transactions through the network for pennies.

Because old miners that mine invalid transactions under the new rules will wind up mining orphan blocks too frequently - causing micro-forks and other inconsistencies.   Technically I guess you could do it with 51%.   Longest chain wins!  But really, if you don't have enough to quickly orphan invalid blocks, there's a real issue.  I think 85% is about the limit.

Segwit is a block size increase.   It increases the max block size on the Block chain to 4mb.  Effectively, it's only 2.1mb.  But technically it is a block size increase.  There is no meaningfull definition of block size increase that would exclude segwit.    BU is far more complicated code.

It may not be bitcoin, but it woudl magically have value.  If exchanges support it, I would bet that it would shake out so that BU would have 85% of the value.   When Ethereum forked into 2 coins, value and hashpower were very closely linked.   Bitcoin would be no different.

Gdax volumes are about the same as usual.   Most traders I talk to don't seems to care about BCH.   Not suprising to me.   
 - move off an exchange, split BCH, transfer back, and maybe lose 1% along the way - for an off-chance that BCH will really be worth anything at all.   meanwhile your BTC are tied up during possible price action.
 - ship all your BTC to a chinese exchange, sell off the futures value of the BCH, and hope they let you transfer it back.
 - stay on the exchange, let your market making and trading application continue making money and hope coinbase credits you if BCH is worth something

Either that or wait for the mem pool to fill up a bit.   Ant pool mines zero transaction blocks today... even if the mem pool is full, because the speed increase leads to them getting a block out first.   That kind of gaming sucks *worse* than minimum tx would.   Min tx of 1/4th or even 1/10th would prevent some of this.   I'd bet that miners would find it's a lot faster to mine what's in the mem pool , rather than generating fake transactions.  So minimums would prevent that behavior.

Get a cheap laptop, install LND, load it with some bitcoins, open some channels with a couple other public hubs, publish the public key of the hub on reddit somewhere for anyone to connect to.
Now you're a "hub operator"... and you can make some crappy passive income in exchange for providing a service and maybe exposing yourself to theft if that laptop is compromised.
Basically every lnd node is a major target.   Because you *know* they have cash sitting in them.   And not a small amount.

This is the markets estimation of the price of bitcoin at some time in the future when a "real" tracking ETF can be purchased, in which case the prices should come down to parity.   The only other bitcoin tracker halted trading recently:   leaving GBTC the only vehicle for exposure.  That also could have shifted institutions towards GBTC.   Given the rate of growth of BTC, and the regulatory hurdles involved in a tracking ETF, the time horizon is probably over a year.

really?   like what exactly.  the best way to stop centralization is to encourage new miners.   how do you encourage miners?  1. work toward mass user adoption, 2. stuff like getblocktemplate, 3. fork to an asic resistant hash.  none of which core devs have even touched.  in fact, i've see quite the opposite.   keep number of transactions low, prevent mass adoptions by resisting stuff like BIP75, and never once talk about changing the hash.

Micropayment channels work now.   You can set up a channel for micro-payments between two devices, for example, like two router.  And you can do zero fee micropayments between the devices.   For example, you can set a fee for watching a movie and pay by the minute.

That's probably because because a) you've drunk the kool aid or b) you never actually worked at a bank that borrows from the fed.   When the fed issues 0% interest loans, that's essentially "printing money".   And the "friends" are big banks.   When the fed buys stocks in the open market... that's a different set of friends.   But it's all just handing money out to rich people.   If you're close to the nexus of where the cash-printing people reside, you can really see the effects.

Sharding is like "automatic sidechains" or a "merkle tree" instead of a "merkle chain".   Sharding basically intentionally weakens double-spend protection for "small" transactions.   Which ultimately makes sense.   No one needs the same level of security for a $5 transaction as a $5 million dollar transaction.   But that's Bitcoin today... same level of security for both.   Asharded chain would allow crypto to scale, fees to be select-able based on level of security needed, etc.

Bitcoin is not a company.  It's a ledger protocol.   And just like TCP/IP, there is no "competition" worth talking about.   
Yes there are competitors to tcp/ip, but do you know anyone who actually uses IPX/SPX, BIC TCP, CUBIC TCP, P-TCP, S-TCP, HS-TCP ,YeAH-TCP, Africa TCP, or HSTCP-LP?   They are all clones of TCP/IP with slight modifications and niche usage.   Sound familiar?   Altcoins are no different here.   
Open source is *extraordinarily powerful* because any meaningful features from alt-coins will be added to Bitcoin.   The fact that they haven't has nothing to do with Bitcoin being "deadlocked" in some way.   It is because these features *aren't meaningful*.
Bitcoin is not for trading or speculating.   It's *instead of* a bank account and it will upend *all fiat* ... precicely as McAffee said.

BCash inventors are paying to support nearly double the inflation rate of bitcoin and the net result of that have been erratic fee estimations in Bitcoin.   Before the last EDA oscillation, the mempool emptied and fees in Bitcoin were pennies for a 15 minute confirm.   At bcash's peak oscillation, the BTC fees were $7 per tx.   Those wild swings can be construed as an attack.   (Bcash always has no fees because there is nobody using it... so there's nothing to lose.)
Still, the attack looks like its winding down.   BCash miners are now mining at a slight loss just to keep it afloat.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:44:05
The price is still artificially high.   I suspect it will remain high for a very long time, because there are few blocks being mined, and most people don't know how to claim it.   In fact, I know many people who lost all their BCH just moving coins around normally (out of and into cold storage wallets, for example), because they no longer have access to a wallet from before the fork.   I have been helping people claim them, but it is not easy!

It actually has no effect on the cost of spamming the network to drive up fees, but does double the costs of every other part of the network.   Fees are a hockey-stick chart.   They are near zero until blocks are full and then hockey stick up.   No reason why larger blocks change much about the cost of spam.   Just keep your spam just below the hockey stick ... at 4 hour confirms, and people with real transactions that need 15 minutes to an hour will pay to pass you.   
That being said, the spammers will not attack the 2x chain.   So yes, the 2x chain will be faster.   Just like they are not attacking the BCH chain (it barely gets 100 tx per hour).   
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:15:33

The only way I can think of is to conditionally remove the EDA.   The code should look like this:
"If the last 6 blocks took less than 20 minutes EACH, then the EDA code is permanently disabled"
Deactivating the EDA after it is no longer necessary is the one way to stop the whiplash effect BCH is having on the space.
Another way is to do a geometric scale back:
"If the last 6 blocks took less than 20 minutes EACH, then the EDA threshold doubles"
This also drives the EDA to zero eventually without turning it off all at once... making each exploit exponentially harder to perform.

I like the idea of comparing them, but you really need to attribute each commit more carefully - checking to see which branch it was done in first.

A way of creating a two-way pegged token that has similar security characteristics of Bitcoin, but that can be transacted more quickly.   Basically you can use drivechain tokens instead of Bitcoin for lower-value transactions and lower-value storage.   Then when you have enough drivechain tokens you can convert them to Bitcoin 1 to 1.   The actual value of drivechain tokens in the market could be less than bitcoin, but that would be based on increased centralization risks and should be a very small fraction.... maybe 1 to .99 or something.    Pretty good tech though.   Vastly increases the throughput of the network.

Here's an argument:  
Block size limit doesn't actually matter than much.  You could, technically have "no limit", and let miners just include as many transactions as the want.   Most miners would then just set their own limits, based on the cost of validation.   Even today, some miners choose to mine a zero-transaction block... because the speed of mining is just enough more to offset the loss in fees.   Large pools might choose to mine larger blocks... which would be slow to propagate, but xthin blocks mitigate that problem to a great degree.   Enough so that the advantage afforded to large blocks mined by large pools would be offset by the disadvantage of slower validation times.   Eventually the average block sizes would settle down to the largest number that keeps orphans from being an issue.   Massive blocks will never be economical, until fees are pushed up to justify them.

The inflation rate looks to be 2.8x higher than bitcoin's over the longer term (data from 
This was predicted 3 days ago: 
The only solution, in my opinion, is for Bitcoin users to stop ignoring the split (more than 90% have not sold).  
Many users and some exchanges (I'm looking at you Coinbase) have chosen to ignore BCH.   As a result, their tokens are locked up, and the real supply for BCH is  less than a million split tokens (and the real market cap is less than a billion dollars).
By ignoring this threat to the network you are essentially complicit in the attack.   Fortunately, any user can sell off BCH tokens and dampen the attack at any time.   Right now they are worth $600 each.   For a little effort, you can help push down the price, and therefore the hash oscillations of the current attack.

Miners all switch away from bch to BTC. This triggers the eda, drives up BCH inflation, and attacks Bitcoins hashrate while temporarily raising fees.   They can do this every 3 days.   
As long as Bitcoin holders aren't selling their BCH this oscillator will continue.   Nobody cares if the bch network sucks with 12 hour block times some days and 30 second block times others.... because nobody uses it.

It has zero hashpower until Nov15th... then wwe'll see what it has.   Until then, it's all fake.   Segwit had 30% hashpower and yet... it activated at the last minute.   UASF has no effect, until.... it was honored 100%.    It's very hard to predict where things will go in this space.
Coinbase hasn't yet started running 2x nodes.   If they do, I will remove my coins and business from Coinbase, and so will the majority of traders and holders that I personally know.... and this includes people with 100k coins and more.   I will instead, move them to an exchange that supports 1MB non-witness blocks, which are more secure because they turn attacks into fees, more money for miners and greater hashpower to secure my money.
And they will get sued, hard, for fraudulently selling "Bitcoins" to people when "Bitcoin" is no longer a clearly defined product.   I would expect the price to crash to $500 level if Coinbase really tries to push this hard.   They are under immense pressure to back out now.   But I cannot predict their moves.

It's not nonsense.  As the incentives drop the hashpower drops.   And the peak effect on Bitcoin drops.   This last oscillation was 20% less of an effect than the previous.   It will continue to be less and less until it's meaningless.   But unless people split and sell, the effect will remain strong for months.   Right now the mempool is draining out, fees are dropping because it's at the bottom of the oscillation.   So the shitposts and FUD are drying up too.   But every few days it will start up again.  I don't want this dragging out until November.   There are some big cold storage holders than can *end this today*.   But they are too chicken or lazy or don't even know they can do it.

Well, the proposal BIP103 was to scale the blocks in accordance with technological growth.   Extrapolated out, that would get us to 8MB blocks in 12 years.   Sounds OK to me.   Personally I like this formula:
    P=17%
    Pn = P*0.95
    X = 1
    Xn = X * (1+P)
That converges on, but *never reaches* 32 MB.   So it lasts forever, with a decreasing percentage increase.

Bitcoin is still working fine, but most fee estimators use longer moving averages and cannot detect patterns.   So even if I know that fees will drop to 10 cents on Bitcoin in a few hours because the EDA is over and BCash hashrate will soon be zero, the fee estimators won't say "10 cents in 2 hours" they will say $7 for "2 hours".
Of course, anything that "attacks" Bitcoin can be trivially done to BCash too.     Someone *could* spam it right now, drive up latency and deepen miner centralization, etc.   But it would cost about $10K per day to do it.   The same attack on Bitcoin costs $200-$500K per day or more.   Someone is footing the bill.   Question is who.

QE causes inflation precisely at the rate of increase of money supply created.   We *do* see a high real inflation from 5 to 10%.   Why woudl QE cause "hyperinflation" beyond the increase in money supply?  It cannot.
UK cost of living:
Since 1993: house prices have risen from an average of £62,333 to £247,000
In 1993, the RPI was 62.944 – in 2012 it was 108.560
In 1993, the average UK wage 20 years ago was £19,774 – rising to an all time high in 2008 of £24,683 – and last year settling at £22,524 (Source: Rate Inflation)
So although you are blessed with a salary that tracks inflation.   Most people are not.   And your savings, certainly, has suffered as well.
The fact is that most people have zero or negative savings.  the wealthiest 8 people in the world control more money than the poorest 50%.   So for the vast majority of people... inflation doesn't matter so much... as long as their salary goes up with it.    But for people who actually are trying to save money ... they are getting screwed.   The system is rigged to ensure most people cannot "get ahead", and have to just work hard every day - enriching someone else with their labor - until they die.

No, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash.  This was an underhanded move and it could have been made explicit: "we support the btc1 implementation of segwit2x... please move to that version".   That would have been fine.
Not "We support segwit, please move to this forked coin that supports segwit" ... and also secretly supports a future hard fork that we're not mentioning on purpose.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:20:36
It is simply true.
There is no way to deposit because the exchanges have an ERROR message on the deposit box.   
Blocks ARE being mined slowly, and my transaction send of BCH to ViaBTC for sell is mined.   But they require 20 confirms.   So maybe in 5 days people can sell?  Who knows.
If I could get an address to deposit to at an exchange I would do it.
Kraken does not allow BCH deposits.   Bittrex does not allow as well.
EDIT: I just checked bittrex, kraken bitfinex exchanges.  Nobody supports deposits or withdrawals yet.   They are all just trading their own stack internally.
EDIT: I tripled my money twice today on this shit.  I had very little sitting on exchanges but since volatility was high I figured "why not put a lowball bid in", and "why not put a high sell in" ... crazy.   People are getting *screwed* over this and if this was more than a couple grand I would feel guilty right now.   
Hint:  Your .00001 bid will get executed in 2 days (or whenever deposits work) when the whales start dumping.    That will be a way to multiply by 10x again if you get in/out at the right time.

That image was false on so many levels.   Back then you couldn't send a million dollars with Bitcoin without getting killed on execution on both ends to the tune of $100K. or more   
Now you can send the same million and you'll get hit for $10K in execution losses.
In a few years, you'll be able to send the same million for $1K or less.  And then Bitcoin will be fine.

You can only get BCH by selling BTC.   You cannot sell BCH mined, you cannot sell BCH split.  The blockchain itself isnt' really functional, takes 5 hours to confirm a transaction, and maybe 3 days to confirm a deposit at an exchange.

It was *always* possible to double spend a zero conf, but the question *remains* "is it worth it".   Now that Bitcoin is worth more, and is used for larger transactions, the answer is, increasingly, *yes*.   So discouraging zero-conf use, except in a scenario with some recourse, is advisable.

I think the core issue is that you actually believe the CPI/RPI reports your government is spewing out to make you trust their printed currency.  
Once you've been alive long enough to watch as your salary has to double every 10-20 years just to keep up with inflation... you'll see that it's a lot higher than the govt likes to claim.  I literally can't believe how much I'm making and how little it goes.
If you're not getting at least a 5% raise, you're losing the game.  I've never been below 5%, and I'm still pretty sure that I'm falling behind compared to others who own larger businesses.

@_date: 2017-08-23 10:31:42
Utxo commitment in each block.    New nodes get a 1 year old utxo and chain from there.   Instead of verifing the checksum manually you verify the difficulty manually to be sure you have the correct utxo and chain.
That + flexible block size will allow Bitcoin to scale for the long term.

2.) Wrong.   Ether difficulty has nothing to do with Bitcoin's.   It is on its own schedule, and there is currently a 14% inflation rate.  In other words, the difficulty is adjusted up or down as needed to keep 14% new ETH.   By comparison, bitcoin is adjusted to maintain around 2-3%.    Eth will go down, but never to zero....   Bitcoin is scheduled to go to zero.
3.)  Precisely.   The whole idea behind dapps may be fundamentally flawed.   In which case, ETH is just a less secure and more centralized version of Bitcoin.
4.) Any BTC you spend is converted to ICO tokens... on the ETH chain and denominated in ETH.   
5.) Yes, there are unfortunately no developers qualified to write or review these contracts.  And it may be proven nearly *impossible* to do so securely.   If the original inventors can't do it.... how can anyone else be expected to?

No, they will have to pay less per tx to be at that point below the curve.   But they will have to do twice as many transactions.   Block size increase does not change the cost for a miner engaging in a fee manipulation attack - unfortunately.   I wish it did.

If bigger blocks were so awesome, then someone would submit a pull request to core following the proposals that have community support like spoonet.  "Core" is not an exclusive organization.   Anyone can start contributing any time.
They won't though, because these are not serious recommendations, with any amount of support.   If big blocks had support, they would be developed correctly.   But nobody wants to do this.

LN hubs don't need to have fixed addresses.   They have a different address per channel.   And forcing a channel close isn't the "death" of a hub.   And even if it was, the incentives for killing off hubs simply do not reward miners sufficiently... because it hurts the value of the very coin they are mining.

I think the general consensus on the expected block reward every 10 minutes is probably the most important rule in Bitcoin.   Changing that sucks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:39:25
A spam attack is ineffective because it creates higher fees, rendering it expensive and therefore inefficient.  If it didn't then the bandwidth and block size would grow even more quickly than it does today. 
For example, if blocks were "arbitrarily large" based on the fees of the previous set of blocks, for example, then spam attacks would continually push up the block size until the network started suffering from latency, node dropoffs, etc.
ETH solves this by centralizing gas prices, which is roughly equivalent (in bitcoin land) to having a fixed minimum fee.   They only change when everyone agrees to change them.
I would not be opposed to a fixed minimum fee in order to push block size up more safely.

Nobody is spamming it because it will cost about $10K per day to keep it full, and nobody wants to finance that, and besides latency isn't really a concern on BCH.  Bitcoin costs $200K/day (more?) to keep the mempool full, and there are many people that benefit from attacking it.

No, I agree, it was not 100% wash trades, definitely there was more liquidity.   But not *that* much more.   And, to be honest, leaving your money on an exchange forever just to avoid the transfer fee is really bad practice.   I'd rather see exchanges that let users move money in and out for fixed mining fees (15-20 cents) only - but that charge normal make/take fees for trades.   This will lead to better cross-exchange arbitrage,  better *global* liquidity and much higher security in the long term.   The last thing the market needs is another bitfinex or gox theft.

@_date: 2017-08-22 14:10:45
Even one major exchange moving to segwit tx would drop traffic by 10% and fees by 50%.   Once they all move fees could go dangerously low.   Remember, Bitcoin's security is linked to its fees.   When fees are too low, Bitcoin gets weaker.

DOS attacks on the network are made far more expensive with higher fees.   And yes, it is obvious someone is paying to drive up fees on the network and is also DOS'ing nodes, etc.   Bitcoin is always under attack.   The sooner people get that the sooner they understand Bitcoin.

I seriously analysed it myself and with a scale free network, the most likely topology, the lightning network allows cheap transactions without growing the block chain and 90 percent off all fees paid to miners.   It only gets us to 100 million users though.
We will probably need a block size increase at that point.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:09:42
$7 if you weren't using segwit/too lazy to upgrade you mean.   If you demand that your vendors support it, they will.   and when they do (trezor was a big one), you will find fees going down under $1 even on busy days.    At least until we hit the 2mb limit.
You can see only 1% of the users seem to care enough about fees to switch wallets, or do what they have to to get their costs down: 
This gives a rough idea of exactly how much of the fee fear mongering was "shills" and "spam".   99%.   
OK, for the benefit of the doubt, and assuming some sort of Poisson error, I'd go to 98%.   I mean there's a chance that half the people who care are just too lazy to upgrade or don't feel like installing a core client, or only keep their coins on exchanges that don't support it... etc.   But there's equally a chance that the 1% who do use it are fanboys and also don't care about fees.   So 98% bullshit is generous.
So all that crap over at r/btc is, empirically, at least 98% bullshit.

Absolutely not.   Because BCH difficulty adjust faster *only downward*.   If it had a corresponding rule to adjust difficulty upward when it's too easy, it would have a proper 10 minute mean.   But it doesn't.   Right now block times are 2 minutes.   So this exploit is happening live.      Every time the EDA kicks in ... that's inflation in the BCH money supply.

block time of 10 minutes, difficulty adjustment every 2 weeks, halving every 4 years.
bitcoin is nothing *but* a bunch of hard coded parameters.   the idea that you should remove them and make them "flexible" is fundamentally flawed.
i would agree to a block size based equal to the sum of block fees.... based on fixed heights and changing every 2 weeks, like the diff adjustment.
a "max size adjustment" parameter like this would allow bitocin to scale properly, without convergence issues.

Of course, it's not actually true that the majority of trading is done in China. That basically means that the SEC is taking at face value the volume numbers as reported by zero-fee exchanges as "real". Why woudl the SEC trust BTCC's volumes?
The idea that "China" trades bitcoin more than anyone else was first made mainstream by the WSJ, and has been repeated ad-nausem. An earlier correlation analysis done by coindeck - which showed that much of that volume is fake - was fundamentally flawed - because it assumed that ratios of local to exchange trading have remained constant. Which, according to Bloomberg, it hasn't. Indeed, programmed trading on zero-fee Chinese trading has skyrocketed. If you have the same entity on both sides of a book making "trades" ... that's not volume.
It's far more likely that the majority of trading is actually done in the U.S. and Europe.

"Wallets" are 1/10th of the transactions right now.   Most of the transactions are exchange related.   And exchanges don't seem to care enough to install an upgrade that has been tested for 2 years, and has been production ready for a year.   Because they don't care.   And if they don't care, that means their users aren't bitching at them enough to care.
Bitcoin's primary use case, right now, is to store and move large amounts of money in an uncensorable manner.     It would be cool if we could get "cheap transactions" on the list... but until users actually care enough to move along level 2 solutions, I would be reluctant to grow the block size.
Right now high fees are a good incentive to upgrade.   Once everyone upgrades... if we still have high fees, we can deploy schnorr sigs (25% block size increase).   Once everyone moves to schnorr, lightning should be live enough to matter.   Once lightning works ... or if it flops... then we will need to increase the block size.
And when we increase it, it should be done in a way that only has to be done once.   I think 17% per year growth up to 32 MB would be sufficient for about 20 years.   Enough to keep people from bitching about block size for a very long time.
But at 32MB, we will hit some issues too, where the code will have to change a lot to deal with it.   So sometime around 2029, we will have to start thinking about the next hard fork above 32MB.
The problem is it's very hard to scale for technological growth.   You need basically to scale with bandwidth availability.  17% per year is pretty good.

I largely support the current development roadmap, but it is right to be wary of Blockstream's motivations.   They have hired a bunch of the best Bitcoin developers and are building a product (LIQUID) whose revenue is tied to some aspects of Bitcoin functioning poorly or slowly.  
That being said, I don't think Blockstream has enough influence to push poor changes on the rest of the community, and I don't think they are "stifling" Bitcoin.   1MB is already too big, and it's already hard enough to run nodes in a decentralized manner.   Until this is addressed (checkpoints? utxo commitments? node incentives?), scaling on-chain is a poor first choice.
Plus, unless Blockstream are a bunch of idiots, they've probably made more money just holding Bitcoin than any investor expected them to make ever.   As long as Bitcoin is doing well, they should be off the hook for revenue goals for the next few years.   "Just keep improving Bitcoin" seems to be their first order of business.

If you manage to get deposit in on one of these exchanges, you will make a killing because there *is very little value* to BCH. I can't say "I know for sure" what happens.   
But I can say with 100% certainty that a coin with few miners, no sellers, no places to spend, and IMO a poor development team *cannot possibly have meaningful value to me*.
I tried very hard to sell ... I deposited some coins at 4 exchanges, wanting to be first, I installed and synced bitcoinabc from source, and split my keys myself.   I have an ABC wallet with lots of coins.
I have tried to issue deposits to all of the major exchanges.   I tried to transfer a BCH coins to ViaBTC... they allow deposits!   But they want 20 confirmations, and block times right now are hours!
I will post again if any deposits go through.   Anywhere.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:05:48
It's on line 69 of the pow code:
Median Time Past of the current block and the Median Time Past of 6 blocks before has to be greater than 12 hours.    If so, it gets 20% easier to create proof of work. In other words, miners can find blocks 20% easier.
If miners double hashpower during "easy blocks" they will have double the reward (5 minute blocks) during that time, and difficulty will adjust after a week.
If they halve the power during "hard blocks", as is their incentive, they will get slow (20 minute blocks) for 3 weeks - which should average out.   No problem.
But the reality is *far far worse*.   Because that assumes only a doubling.   
Now lets change that to 10x.   If we get a 10x hashpower speedup, that's &gt; 1 block per minute.  2 weeks of blocks are now mined in a couple days.   Then when blocks get hard, you go to near zero.   Now block times are &gt; 120 minutes.  In 12 hours, the EDA kicks in over and over until diff is low enough.  I can play with this in excel and see how it plots.   Pretty sure a 2.5 minute block time average over 2 week period is the lower bound assuming no miners are "charitable" and are trying to defend the BCH network from this exploit.
*The EDA code should have been removed after the first "natural" difficulty adjustment.*   
*This is a pretty big bug, and will require a hard fork to fix.*
Of course some miners will refuse to do this, which makes it harder to exploit.   A miner with 10% of the *combined Bitcoin and BCH hashpower* that refuses to exploit this could defend it... because he can prevent the EDA from ever kicking in again.   But any miner that simply *follows the most profitable chain* will cause the exploit to kick in.

This is a trivial exploit that effectively increases the # of blocks per day and block reward offered to miners mined by 20-100%.   This means the inflation rate is far higher on BCH.   It also causes block times to "remain erratic" for as long as BCH still exists.

The whiplashing is built in to the protocol.   As the difficulty drops down, more miners come on board until the coin is mopre profitable that bitcoin.   When that happens Bitcoin's massive mining power begins to shift, mining blocks with 1.3 minute block times.   Then, when the difficulty adjusts upward, profitability goes to 1/5th of Bitcoin's.   So all the rational miners shift away.   Then it takes 3-4 days for the EDA to kick in again.   Then it gets super cheap and more profitable.... 
 Any miner that mines the most profitable coin is on board.  
The EDA essentially causes mass inflation.

Fees in bitcoin land generally go up with the price.   And this *has* to be the case, because fees pay for mining security.   Until we have layer 2 solutions, Bitcoin simply won't work well as a payment mechanism for timely small value transfers.   This was well known many years ago.

This is the worst possible advice.   
Now take someone who is worth $100 mil and doesn't have a job, but lives off the interest.    Their labor is worth very little compared to their net worth.   So they shouldn't invest more than, say, 5% or "whatever they can afford to lose".    
But, if you're not a millionaire now, and you're looking at 40 years of labor exploitation as your guaranteed future, that $50K you can extract from your house for 10 bitcoins is a loss of *nothing* if Bitcoin goes to zero.  You'll still have to work hard every day for the rest of your life.   Maybe with a smaller TV.   Who gives a shit.
A professional in the U.S. labor is probably worth $100k/year now and $200k in 10 years.   Your labor is your biggest asset.  Not your stupid house.   
So mortgaging everything you own now is a very small fraction of the millions your future labor is worth.   And if you lose it all because Bitcoin turns out to be broken, then you can always declare bankruptcy.     Which is a big financial hit.   
But whatever.   It's not going to change your life much as long as you can get a job.   The inverse... Bitcoin isn't broken, well you'll be one of the richest people in the world with 10 Bitcoins.   
Because there are more than 21 millionaires now.   And none of them are you.  Yet.

Yep.   But behind the scenes, groups like Circle Financial do billions in OTC trades - and are probably even more important.  You have to remember, most of the very big buyers of Bitcoin are people that *don't want you to know who they are*.   They buy direct from massive miners who don't want to dump on exchanges and get shitty execution.  Or they buy from OTC sellers.  Bitcoin is not traded as publicly as people think.   Order books account for only part of the liquidity.

Yeah, Airbitz has a smart fee estimator, I like it.  I've never waited more than 20 minutes, and I've never paid an rate higher than I would expect from the current traffic.

If you look at the followup discussion, the consensus was that the 2MB would be the base block size.   I was part of that discussion on the bitcoin-dev list and I can assure you, this was a serious block size increase.   
I agree, however, I do not think it would be accepted by most people unless a variant BIP 103 was used for the increase portion.   Indeed, I would argue against any proposal that doubled the base block size in a short time frame.   A graduated scaling like BIP103 makes more sense, although I think 20%/year is acceptable given current data on bandwidth growth globally.

This debate is and always has been about fucking with the price.   Bitcoin's capacity is clearly able to handle 100% of the traffic with modest fees.   Even at the height of the spam attacks $2 would move your coins.   And if it wasn't for the spam prevention in place, those attacks would have been cheap and the network would have been crippled.

Very few alts have a comparable amount of development, lines of code checked in, debate and review ETH is close, with 100 developers, 33 maintainers and about 10 or so very active ones... similar to Bitcoin's 400 devs, 14 maintainers and 20 or so very active.   Both have a similar amount of debate per pull request, and a similar number per day.

It is possible.   You can hard fork again to peg a unidirectional burn between two chains at a fixed rate, effectively forcing a merger.  
The advantages of a merger should be the combination of features of two chains where there is a high consensus +95pct at least) to effect the merger.
I always though Bitcoin could absorb an altcoins dev team, community and features this way.   But it would probably be hard for *everyone* to agree on it.

Silver has far more utility than gold in industry.   95-99% of the value in gold and silver has to do with their use as currency and a store-of-value.  My point is: one does not dilute the other *for this use case*.    Silver and gold are both fairly heavy, soft, rare metals.  
As far as fundamentals, litecoin and bitcoin differ in the hash used, the block rates, and the development teams.   They are not interchangeable... any more than silver and gold are.   
Why has gold maintained its advantage over silver?  It has less use in industry and there is far more above ground supply!  Because the larger the value stored in gold, the more useful gold is to move value.   Therefore the utility as a currency grows over time.  Bitcoin is similar.

Assuming a very small 600MW reactor, and 10 GH/S/W (0.1 GH/Joule), that would be 6 EH/S.  Currently we're around 6 EH/S for all hashpower combined, so about 50%.  Of course nuclear reactors can go up to gigawatts - so it could be as much as 70% or more - but also a lot of power will be needed for "other things" besides mining (KTLO), there's quite a bit of overhead.   So I think 6 EH is still a reasonable back-of-the-envelope estimate for a single reactor of moderate size.
Interesting to know that Bitcoin currently consumes the electricity of a single small nuclear reactor though.

Lightning allow main chain fees to be high, but fees for small transactions, like paying for coffee, to be low.   It does this by accumulating small transactions and turning them into one big transaction.
Essentially, this reduces UTXO size, blockchain size and expense.  It allows fees on the main chain to remain high for larger transfers of slower but more secure transactions.   And it allows fees to be low for smaller value transactions.  
Having two kind of transactions, one for smaller amounts and one for larger is important now.

It works in a similar way.   ETH is infinite and is at a fixed, non-decreasing rate.   So the 14% will go down, percentage wise, but a lot slower than bitcoin's scheduled rate decrease.   This is a pretty big consideration in the long term.   Because it means that ETH won't be a true hedge against inflation until 2025.   Whereas Bitcoin *already is*, and in 2020, will be better than most government bonds.

Full nodes are another intermediary.   There is no good solution here, only two bad ones.   One is a bad one for sure (smaller network with miners running full nodes), and the other is a bad one maybe (fragmented lightning network).
One of them is a mistake you can undo (if lightning doesn't work... don't use it), the other you can't (once the blockchain is 10TB, it always will be).
I'll take lightning first, and then if it sucks, we can play around with block sizes.

It is misleading to buy a coin with a fixed inflation rate when the rate is actually much higher.   I think it's hard to squeeze that fact into a title.   
The exploitation of the EDA appears to have already started.   We will only know if this is the case in a couple days when the difficulty adjusts.   
This is an "economic exploit", yes.   But it can happen if a miner is merely configured to mine the most profitable chain.

You really need to run a node, and see how hard it is just to keep the block height at the full height.   
It's hard, slow and not fun to maintain.   Peers drop off like crazy, new ones come online with weird fake chains.   You get DDOSed if you listen, if you run BU, if you don't run BU.
I got into a weird situation on a non-listening node where all my 8 outbound connected peers weren't relaying transactions.   Ever.   Had to restart it.
Basically it's already hard enough to run a node.   Quadrupling my bandwidth and latency is *not* ok right now.
Let's see how segwit goes.   If it works out, then maybe we can play around with block sizes.

Can 300 satoshis per byte and competition for 1 million bytes per 10 minutes provide enough incentive to secure a network that has 2.1 quintillion satoshis at stake? 
Once you start thinking about the protocol and caring about the security of that protocol, the number of dollars is not the primary concern.
Bitcoin needs to work at this protocol level first.   Getting it to work at the "real" level is super cool, and people are working on stuff like lightning and mimblewimble to handle that.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:41:02
The maximum block size is now 2 MB.   If people aren't using it, maybe that's because they don't really care enough about the fee to use the extra space.

Why does the hub know anything about you?   If i ran a hub, I wouldn't give a crap who anyone was.  Indeed, I have been experimenting with building and locking down a lightning hub for that very purpose.  And if I opened a channel with a hub, it would be contingent on providing no other information other than my transaction.
You don't have to worry too much about cheating with lightning.   The cool thing is that the hub operator can't steal your funds.   All they can do is prematurely collapse your channel.   Which will result in angry reddit posts, and that operator becoming quickly extinct.

Bitcoin has been under attack for a while now.   The block size is a *defense* against these attacks.   Higher fees make hashpower attacks less likely, higher fees also make transfers more secure and smaller blocks keeps Bitcoin highly distributed.
Indeed, the future of Bitcoin *must* be very high fees and a layer 2 network for regular transactions or Bitcoin may fail.   I don't think most core devs want to paint the picture so negatively, but it really is bad.
Try running a full node at home, please, and turn on listening.

Segwit is the easiest, quickest way to relieve pressure.   It's also a lot safer.  It's been extensively tested and contains support for faster block propagation, etc.   The "alternatives" being promoted right now are forking the entire coin into two coins ... the way Ethereum forked.

1. ETH was premined.   What that means is that the foundation retained many of the coins.   So much of the value in ETH is you trusting that they won't sell.
2. ETH has a 14% inflation rate and an unlimited supply.   Yes, this inflation rate goes down, but this monetary policy may be unattractive in the long term.   This has a side effect of inflating the ETH blockchain, which right now is so large that nobody even knows how long it takes to download.
3. ETH was never intended to be a store of value, the tokens were intended to be used as gas for smart contracts.   Indeed, one of the first ETH contracts was a Bitcoin tracker, allowing you to exchange Bitcoins using the Ethereum platform.   But people seem to have forgotten about that, and just pretend ETH *is* money.   
3. ICO offerings have pumped ETH's price from $15 to $300 in less than a year.   But many of these ICO's have turned out to be fraud (see above).   Fraud is only a sustainable way to grow value for so long.   There are no ICO projects that have been successful by any reasonable measure of utility.
4.  The Ethereum smart contract language is too complex to use by non-experts.   One of the latest smart contract bugs that resulted in a $30 million dollar loss - was a template written by reference code developer.
5. The market no longer responds to theft negatively.   This is a *very* bad sign.   There have been 3 major thefts in the last two months... the multisig wallet hack, coindash and veritaseum... but nobody seems to care.   The price has barely taken a hit - hovering around $300.  This implies, to me, that the money in the market is *completely irrational*.

It actually, really goes to rich people.   It lowers their costs of doing business while not obligating them to do more business at all.   A good example is that bank loans to small businesses remained at the 5-9% level (and even went up) as the overnight rate dropped from 1.5% to 0%.   The idea that there are a bunch of people out there responding to QE with more investment is fundamentally flawed.   
At very low levels of interest (below 2%) there is almost no tangible net improvement in lending rates, amounts or risks that banks take.   
And the worst offender isn't the fed.   The U.S. lends itself money (really), printed in order to prop up overspending.
Real inflation has been from 5-8% a year, while reported inflation is 2% or less.   If you're over 35, you have to know that in the last 15 years, the cost of living has at least doubled - while salaries have tracked the CPI.  
Read this:
That's a *very* conservative 4.9% inflation rate - not counting resource availability, cost of trade, labor changes and government spending hikes.
Bitcoin is about having a place to put your money that isn't subject to this wild devaluation.   It's about the "well connected" not getting "arbitrarily and bizarrely richer" in response to government policy.
Look at the baseline of bitcoin's long term $USD graph.   When it flattens out to 4.9%, you know that Bitcoin has achieved success.

Right now you can send segwit transactions with a 50%-75% fee discount.   This is very little effort.   Only Trezor has announced beta support for it.   Clearly the demand for cheap fees isn't as high as people think.   Maybe, just maybe, the whole fee thing is a bit out of proportion.   And LN is *not* years away.   It's, at most, a few months away... but that's a few months of *users giving crap*.   Which, right now, they apparently don't.
So, basically we have 2 solutions on the table to high fees.   One is live, deployed and tested.   The other is a few months of development away.   Eclair wallet could hit mainnet next week, and BitPay could support it with a few weeks of effort.   The fact that they *aren't* doing this implies that there simply *isn't* demand for it.
Indeed, if BitPay was the *only* channel partner in the world, and Eclair was the only mobile wallet in the world, that would be a sufficient solution for cheap, centralized, but still pseudononymous transactions that are no more censorable than they are today.    
BitPay had 6 months to develop this.   Why haven't they?   Where is their beta?

Indeed, it is happening as expected.   BCH is dropping *as hashpower increases*.    Because those miners will need to sell.   In 2 days BCH will be worth less, and hashpower will be very low, but the EDA will kick in.... so the difficulty will drop again.   But this time miners and investors will both be wise to the gold rush.   At around 5% of Bitcoin's value it's not worth a miner's time to play games with hash pumping, so it should stabilize.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:45:09
The fee is even lower on DOGE coin.   Why use BCH, which has 1 hour block times right now?  DOGE confirms in a minute for less.   If all you care about are fees - DOGE winz.

Do you know anyone with a M.S. in Comp Sci?   Ask them to read the whitepaper, and compare it to the state of the art in crypto.   From a game theory perspective Tezos is a complete failure.   Any user can come along, buy a bunch, and vote in new code that favors them over everyone else in subtle way.   Or, if they can't and the "Tezos foundation" has some sort of veto power, then it's not decentralized.
In other words, it's either entirely bullshit or, possibly, a scam.

I think the ability to short Bitcoin makes it more affordable to attack than most people think.   This may be a fundamental failure of Bitcoin conceptually.

I doubt, very much, that fees will go to $100 in the future.   But, if they do, we can safely assume that Bitcoin is worth at least $1 mil per coin.   Because this fee level assumes that schnorr sigs, mimblewimble, and other enhancements have failed to keep fees down... so even though there are now room for hundreds of channel opens and closes per second.... the fees are still high.
At that fee level there must be millions of places to spend my coins, and opening a mimblewimble layered lightning channel is something that most people now do.
So I open a channel every month with my salary check in it.  It costs me $100, but I can then spend that $10K for instant and near-zero fees on my rent, utilities, and groceries every day.  If I manage to accumulate any significant savings, I might close out a channel to move money into long-term savings.  And hey ... $100 still isn't much to move $50k in savings.   I pay a lot more today dealing with large amounts of dollars.   
Therefore, at the $100 fee level, nobody would need to "urgently" open a channel ... because nearly everyone would have them open for salary, etc.

It is absolutely true.   I am pro-segwit, but it definitely helps spammers more than normal users.   Spammers can artificially create massive transactions, whereas normal users will not.   It make it cost less for someone to *bloat the blockchain and consume bandwidth*.   But other than that, it doesn't have any negative effect.    *It doesn't make it cheaper for someone to exclude normal users from the chain... which is the real spam issue.*

 - There has been no serious attempt.   That is completely false.    The last "try" was a Bitcoin Classic pull request, and when people started requesting changes and protections (as mentioned), and basically ridiculed his flextrans proposal, the dev involved "ragequit" Bitcoin.   Nobody since then has tried.
 - To be fair, the open source community is generally fairly abrasive and rude.   But this is true of just about every open source project I have ever worked on, so that's not surprising.  If you simply implement all the things that all the devs need to get your stuff into core... then it gets in.
 - Segwit2x is an exclusive group with a single agenda.   They have not submitted a pull request to core for the 2x fork.   There were lots of changes requested to be made to their BIP proposal that was posted in bitcoin-dev, by myself and others, but these changes were either ignored or ridiculed.

There are many simultaneous attacks on Bitcoin going on:
 - Social network attacks - this post has more upvotes than the number of users that typically vote on all posts in a day... clearly manipulated.
 - Promotion of BCH And SW2X and other forks - these are coins with little/no real-world use dominating new releases, press and attention.   (BCH is literally slower and more expensive to use than DOGE coin.)
 - Mempool stuffing and fee attacks - any casual glance at mempool sizes and fee charts will reveal that the recent spike from $1 to $5 fees was not "organic growth".   This is an attack.   The fees are the cost that users pay to defend against it.  
I would fully expect these to culminate at the next BCH difficulty adjustment with an even more aggressive narrative, maybe an exchange hack (exit scam) or something to spice things up.
Bitcoin is clearly doing something right, to garner this level of sophisticated assault.   
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:11:49
Market cap numbers in crypto are absurd.   Even Bitcoin's number is inflated by at least 3 to 1.   But BCH is probably like 100 to 1.  The amount of value stored is the amount you can extract from it.   Right now, you can try to extract 3 billion from bitcoin over the course of a a month ... and watch the price collapse by 20% when you do so.   So did you really have $3 billion?   And is the current market really $60 billion?

And there is a ratio of fees to total value in the chain that must be high enough to prevent incentives for a collusion attack.

I got 0.2 on my initial sell, and then 0.11 on my next sell.   Right now, it's back to 0.10.  But still hasn't passed the high of 0.20.    Talking about BCH in terms of dollars is pointless.

Fees should be about $0.50 avg right now, but fees are how Bitcoin defends itself from attacks, so when attacks hit hard, fees go way up.   This causes attackers to have to spend more money on their attack.   Hopefully they will run out of money and go away.

Sorry, I should have said "hold" not "use".
I use U.S. dollars all the time, everyone does, because it's accepted everywhere.   Indeed, when I want to spend Bitcoins, the first thing I do is go to a Bitcoin ATM and withdraw U.S. dollars.   
But I don't *hold* U.S. dollars, because that's stupid in so many ways I can't count them.   Bitcoin is a powerful fixed-inflation rate *ledger* with a built in crappy payment system that works OK.   It is not a replacement for other payment systems and it is not a replacement for fiat.
The idea that Bitcoin will be "accepted everywhere" is nonsense and has little to do with Bitcoin's value as a powerful deflationary asset.   
Some acceptance is needed, of course.   And there remain many things for which Bitcoin is the best possible means of payment - better than any other.
But the more important thing is that Bitcoin is a *platform*.   You can build smart contracts, lightning networks, federated lending networks, and other systems on top of Bitcoin in ways that fiat simply cannot compete with.

I want to be clear that this is the "effective reward per day".   Not the actual reward per block.   The effective increase happens because by driving down hashpower until the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment kicks in, you can get more than 144 blocks per day ... on average.   
Bitcoin Cash yearly inflation rate and mining rewards are effectively increased until/unless EDA is removed from the code.
Block times must remain erratic as long as miners continue to behave rationally and increase their profits by using this exploit.
A miner does not have to be specially configured.   All he has to do is mine the most profitable chain and this will occur.

Exchanges generate floods of transactions every day as users move money in and out.   ETF's don't.   
Also, an ETF is a much safer vehicle than an exchange, since it's not redeemable - none of the vaulted coins are actually "hot".   I'd much rather leave my coin in my nano than in an exchange or an ETF,  but I'd rather leave it in an ETF than an exchange.   Quality ETFs should vastly improve off-chain storage and trading.

Yes, you have to have a segwit node now to get all the data in a block.   Likewise you have to have a p2sh node in order to get the p2sh info.    Also, spv nodes only get the header, not the body.  
Basically, if you run old code, you see a truncated view of things.   As Bitcoin grows in capability, this will be more and more the case over time.  Fortunately 90% of the nodes out there receive the new format, and if you are worried about it, just install a new node and you get the full block (which can be up to 4MB).

Yep.   Blockchain doesn't scale to "everyday" use without layer 2 solutions.   Of course, it's possible for Bitcoin to build-in it's own bitcoin-specific "layer 2".   For example, there can be 8 subchains, indexed by a few bits in a user address, that are mined separately, but automatically checkpointed and swept to the main chain after N blocks.   Incentive will be to use the chain that provides the most security for the fee you're willing to pay.   New chains activate when the sum total fees of the last 20 blocks exceed the block reward of that chain.  Max block size for each new chain is 4x the previous chain.   In this way bitcoin can scale 1000's of times with no change to the central chain.

No.   The issue with spam is when an attacker consumes bitcoin "TPS" bandwidth - preventing normal transactions from being picked up by miners.

And this could be a new, but imo unlikely, attack vector under segwit.

Whatever you consider a transaction.   It's an opinion poll...  the important thing is "what do people consider a transaction".   Is trading BTC for USD on an exchange a "bitcoin transaction".   Or isn't it?   Is lightning a bitcoin transaction... or not?
I posted this poll over at r/btc as well.   And it's shaping up to be as predicted.   r/bitcoin people think some transactions already happen off-chain.   Payment channels are "off chain" for example.  r/btc people don't... they are solidly in the 100% camp.  Payment channels are just some "broken weird thing".

Centralization pressure also includes the cost of validation.   *Running a node, IMO, is the least of the problems.* There is little doubt that larger blocks provide centralization pressure.   BU makes this an order of magnitude worse.  This would allow larger miners to game the system even more than they already do.   F'ing with relay times and validation times to get more blocks per day.
To understand how bad this is you have to full understand why some pools deliberately mine zero transaction blocks today.

1. why would anyone pay/fund via segwit before the 95% activation? 2. apparently segwit has additional security ... it's not really "anyone can pay".   segwit scripts will be recognized by older software as "unable to pay" because of some deliberate script sequence errors that are only valid for people who've upgraded.   this was done as a double-protection in case of a reversion, and to allow single-confs to remain high confidence, etc.  after this version is activated, future soft forks will have this "nobody can spend" feature baked in.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:13:28
There is no major security or other issue, unless you count "making zero-conf transactions even more insecure" - which is like taking zero, dividing by a thousand and saying it's smaller.

Flexcaps are great.   For reference, BU is not a real flexcap implementation.     
Also your graph is missing the maximum size of TCP packets.   Which is 64k, and has been for a very long time.   Probably always will be.   
Bitcoin blockchain can't grow to meet "pay for coffee" demand.   It simply won't happen.   Use an altcoin or lightning or a "disposable sidechain" if you need to pay for coffee.   Use bitcoin if you want to move a lot of money around, or store it for a long time.   
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:10:45
There is no way to reasonably scale a single, linear block chain ledger to handle "everyday transactions".   Better to feel the pain now and figure out the alternatives, than to seek it later.   Personally I think a "forked chain" is going to work out better than a lightning network.  
It's possible to build a  sidechain with bitcoin checkpoints, so that an existing bitcoin miner can trivially validate a side chain transaction - without needing to load an entire chain.
For example: using a bitcoin address, you send via a side chain.   Miner's choosing to mine the side chain only need the last checkpoint + the longest chain to validate the transaction.   
Mining can be PoS+forfeit or some other "weak but fast" variant, but full Bitcoin transaction block with settlement amounts is required, on the Bitcoin blockchain every (24 hours worth of) N blocks.   In this way the side chain need only be secure for double-spends within 24 hours.   So a 24 hour Bitcoin PoS would be sufficient to prevent an attack.  This is, essentially a "T+1" chain.   
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:48:23

A pin locked phone has its memory encrypted. As long as you don't enter the pin, it really cannot be compromised. Or at least it's fairly challenging. Unfortunately the moment you enter your PIN to use the phone it is now subject to zero day, drive by attacks. For this reason it's always better to use a hardware wallet. At least for significant amounts of money. Zero-day vectors are traded for up to a million dollars to criminals and spooks, and most won't waste them on somebody's hundred-thousand-dollar wallet. If you're storing 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin in a phone that's a really bad idea no matter what precautions you take.

internet worked fine during the NYC blackout 14 years ago, if you had a backup charger.   indeed nothing else worked well except land lines (which have federal regulations around their reliability).   and since i had a generator and a fat battery, i was the hub of my building for 3 days.   and bitcoin worked have fine too, even though ATM's did not at the time.  i have no doubt that the pizza guy that supplied food to basically all of soho at the time (he also had backup power... few others did)  would have been fine with bitcoin.  
decentralized electronic money is probably not as good as dollar bills or gold during a *major* collapse.. but you should bear in mind that the internet was designed originally to withstand a nuclear war.

Generally no, it's easy to create "backlogs" in the bitcoin protocol by spamming with transactions that have insufficient fees.   This sort of attack started in June and basically never let up.   It is oft-quoted by news media and people who don't understand how Bitcoin's open protocol works.   Normal fee-bearing transactions are not backlogged.   They won't be until mid-2017 - well after segwit activates, unless it is continually blocked.

is who he's referring to.   
I personally only supported segwit2x because I thought it would get segwit enabled.   The 2x part is rushed and not coded correctly, and I was fairly public about that.   Personally I think we *will* need 2x some day, but we can wait until after schnorr sigs and some other optimizations clean up traffic.    Schnorr sigs actually make stuff like tumblebit and mimblewimble so easy that I don't see why we will even need to raise the 1MB.   With MW, we can pack thousands of TX into a single "hash transaction".
Indeed, the contributor who added most of the lines of code to btc1 repo, james hillard, has publicly stated he only worked on that part to get segwit enabled.  How many "signatories" feel the same way?   
We'll find out soon.

1. It is actually influencing miners who believe that there are "two groups" - instead of one piece of software.
 a. Bitcoin Core is a software implementation.   IMO: It is managed by an inclusive group that invites everyone, even dissenting opinions, to submit pull requests.   They are critical, but encouraging.  
 b. BU is another implementation of a similar coin.   IMO: The managers of their group censor *any* dissenting opinions.  They seem also to discourage logical reasoning.
2. There are many groups within the developers of Bitcoin core that disagree - just search for KYC in the bitcoin dev forums!    But for political reasons, these groups have been lumped into one "core".
3. Miners who choose to mine some other coin are voting for forking Bitcoin into 2 currencies - the way Ethereum was forked.
4. 2MB fork will probably happen in core if fees go up to the point where it's causing adoption issues.   Since that isn't the case now, and shows no signs of being a problem in the near future, it's not really a priority.

While it's abundantly clear that there are no "catastrophic" bugs that will allow anyone to take anything, there could be bugs that allow someone to memory-attack a node, or logic errors that cause transactions that don't pass validation to slip through.  I doubt it, but it's always possible that the tests and reviewers missed something.   At that point it comes down to : do you have confidence that the authors, each of which probably has thousands of bitcoins to lose, are sufficiently motivated and trustworthy?
Fortunately, segwit is a simple change compared to some other soft forks.   There are a lot of code changes, but most of that is massive unit testing.   This is the most extensively tested code change in bitcoin's history.

Segwit doubles the number of transactions, and allows for easy side chains and lightning networks and any number of other scaling solutions that *actually* scale forever.   And we can still move on to a hard fork later if we need it.   Why block a solution now and switch to a less-tested solution that might cause wild price fluctuation.   BU activates at 75%.... that's horrible consensus.   that's basically saying we split bitcoin into BUCoins and BClassic  coins.

They don't do it all the time.   But yes, it is clear that Bitcoin actually has more capacity, but the current protocol is skewed a bit towards mining empty blocks, unless they are very full and rich with fees.   Which means that increasing block size rapidly could kill the market.   The fact that 10% of the network is currently signalling BU .... pushing for larger blocks with lower fees will make it even more glaring.   
There is a nice incentive for large miners game the system, massively increase block size - all the while mining empty blocks - or mining these new massive full blocks. 
If BU is released, I would expect big miners to increase max block size to 16MB - and then result in a more glarinb pattern of "empty/overfull" blocks.   Smaller pools running standard software will suffer and fail, and overall network health will also fall apart.
That's why Core is so crazy about preventing centralization - it's very, very important.   Block size should never be in the hands of miners - who have a financial interest in gaming the system.

Absolutely security vulnerabilities must be patched! 
However because this is a ledger there's an interesting corollary to the soft fork rule.  Anything more restrictive must necessarily be required to repair a security vulnerability. Therefore any security vulnerability can be repaired with a soft fork.     Super cool right? 
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:08:42
Spread on Glidera has always been better than others (maybe less than 0.25%?).   Only the delay is worse... and that's because Glidera is probably lending the float for shorts.   (Which is totally fine - small risk, small reward).   
I bet Glidera used Kraken for the lend in the first place, which makes this a great acquisition for Kraken - access to a growing pool of lendable, profitable Bitcoin.
Anything that makes the challenging fraud-riddled "retail Bitcoin" space more profitable at a sustainable low risk is better for the industry.   And since Glidera doesn't hold customer funds aside from a 4 day risk reduction period, it reduces Bitcoin's overall exposure to another exchange hack.
Kraken:  Please don't break Glidera.  It's working fine!

That's correct.   But this assumes that Segwit doesn't have the forward compatible safety protocol built-in.   Which it does.   "Any spend" segwit transactions are actually "nobody can spend".   Which is far less dangerous.

When a government pays people 2.5% interest on a fiat denominated bond... that barely beats inflation.   But people hold it because it's "safe".

@_date: 2016-11-28 15:00:23
i'm not making an assumption.   segwit doesn't activate until 95% of miners are running segwit.   which means "theft" segwit transactions will not be mined/confirmed by 95% of the miners.   this is the primary reason the soft fork works.   apparently the segwit code contains additional security. old miners will not mine "theft" transactions because segwit transactions are specially marked "nobody can spend" for old miners.... 
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:51:18
I would agree with you if all the current proposals (BU/Classiic) merged in cores' segwit changes as well.   But they don't.   Yuo can have a version that signals BU or Classic for a hard fork AND signals Segwit for a soft.   That would be an example of a "compromise".   But no nodes do that, and no software does that.

"online storage" isn't growing as quickly as offline storage though.   the price of keeping a large amount of storage online includes a lot of costs that have not scaled or have gotten more expensive, like real estate, and salaries.    so this "storage is getting cheaper" argument needs to be toned down a lot.  240GB of dedicated online storage is about $29/month today.   it was about $59 3 years ago.   and 9 years ago, it was about $89/month.   it's getting cheaper.   but it's not going to drop below $19/month or so.   the idea that these prices are "plummeting" is entirely fallacious.

"Anyone can pay" is an issue which can cause a wallet to validate a payment that would never get confirmed/mined.   *This is only a problem if you are using a zero-confirmation payment.*   
Zero-confirmation payments are typically used in *small value* transactions and typically factor in some sort of *premium* to insure the receiver against double-spend loss, and conversion loss.
This premium may have to go up.   Bitpay says, however, that they think it won't have to go up.   People who know how and are willing to exploit a double-spend attack against a zero-conf merchant system may now find their job a *little* easier.   But it was *easy to begin with*.

When I rain mail servers for a half-million domains, I gave a crap when my servers were blocked and tried to fix it.   I don't have access to coinbases's SMTP server logs and bounceback messages.   They do.
But the problem is that Coinbase relys on email as the only way to log in....

"Old nodes will consider transactions spending segwit outputs as non-standard, due to apparent violation of BIP62 CLEANSTACK rules, and thus won’t be included in old nodes’ mempools."

Yep, this will probably happen.   Segwit is more useful as a malleability fix, and less useful as a capacity increase.   The capacity increase was really just "tacked on" in an attempt to appease people.

@_date: 2016-12-08 20:34:09
Yep.  And 2.5 minutes probably won't have much of an orphan problem.   Litecoin gets away with it.  But you'd need to change a LOT of code to look for 12 confirms instead of 6, for example.   And you'd need to quarter the block reward.   And there's really no advantage to doing that.... because off-chain stuff *needs* to be the way we get fast transactions done anyway.   2.5 minutes isn't fast enough for anyone to care about the speed increase, and the blockchain will grow 4x faster, so peopel who worry about that will still be worried.  
A the end of the day you'd need 95% of the miners to upgrade, and a really long activation delay so 95% of the nodes can upgrade too.   
It's a no go.   Neither is a 2MB fork, or Butcoin Unlimited.   Flexcaps are a good compromise.

if you calculate the total value of Bitcoin transactions and then you take the fees from those transactions, and then you add in the 72 hour volume.... thats roughly the intrinsic value as a financial network.
I like to choose 72 hours because that is a traditional settlement time.   And it speaks to bitcoin's value over the existing Network.  Obviously the selection of that window of time is the most important factor in whether Bitcoin has intrinsic value at all.    I think 72 hours is a conservative number.   
Another way of looking at it is... if Bitcoin traded a trillion dollars a day there would be no doubt in anyone's mind that its intrinsic value was more than a trillion dollars.
By this metric bitcoin's intrinsic value is currently about 100 times less than its market cap.
if Technologies like the lightning Network and mimblewimble, etc become more widely used in e: Bitcoin is more broadly used ... we would see the intrinsic value ratio go up.
This is intuitive.

Wow.   It's now been 5 days.  They did finally respond and say they were working on it... but my funds are still locked up because of the listing as sorbs.net.   They need to move them all to another account, because they have no way of getting someone to log in if they do not have email access.    Indeed, if your email goes out, for whatever reason, the only resolution is to wait a week or so while they set up a new account.... no backup contact methods are allowed.
No other exchange has this limitation:   I've used Airbitz/Glidera, Gemini and Circle.   I've stuck with Coinbase because they've always been reliable - even in the face of other redditors posting.   My assumption was "they're probably doing something wrong" or "they just don't know how to use authy".  But really, Coinbase seems to have some issues that lie at the core of how they do security.   I don't think they are insecure.   But the "email only" thing is weird.   I mean.... email isn't even secure to begin with.

Core is not a "single party", that's BU FUD.   Please keep your arguments to reality.   BU promotes xthin blocks to mitigate propagation problems.  It's not an entirely unreasonable proposal in that sense.   
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:32:43
BU has already said they will not be pulling in segwit.   So any pool running BU is also, implicitly, blocking segwit.   Also BU gives more power to miners... so there's a big incentive for miners to push for it.   I wouldn't be surprised if BU wins in the end, if only because it gives more power to miners.   What I wonder is if Bitcoin survives after that...
Bitcoin's miners are behaving irresponsibly - signaling crappy "power-grab" versions that move more control to them.  Gaming the system with empty blocks.   Basically screwing with the protocol.   
Maybe Bitcoin's premise: that you can use game theory to get a distributed group of people to behave responsibly - is falling apart.

It really could go to $1 mil though.   But the difference between 1-2 tril mcap and 17-20 tril mcap is huge.   Because "passing gold for real" is a milestone that will involve a lot of old money displacement.

If everyone held, new users would enter the market and be forced to buy the Bitcoins that the miners have to sell to pay for electricity.   
These Bitcoins would be worth $1mil each or something.
This, by the way... is the future of Bitcoin.   Eventually all mined Bitcoins will be held by people who don't really want to sell them, and only sell them under some sort of financial duress.
Sure, many are held now by people who sell.   But for every day trader there's a holder.   And that holder causes the Bitcoin he has to be "locked up" for years

if miners attack the main chain, or refuse to mine the chain buyers are willing to pay for, they will lose massive amounts of money.   there is not a shred of evidence that buyers are willing to pay for "whatever the miners mine".   indeed, there's a lot of evidence from the prior fork that the opposite is true... that miners will mine "whatever is profitable".
but even if miners choose to mine a chain that nobody is buying on ... then a simple POW change would fix the problem.   the code has already been written, tested and is ready to go.
when coinbase lists "b2x" ... will anyone buy them?   will the price go up or down?   seriously.   I can make a simple prediction:  the value of B2X coins may start high, but will swiftly drop to be about the same as the value of the BCH coins - roughly 10%.   
And my prediction is based on the simple fact that it has *happened before*.   Which is more than you can say about the theory that users will buy "whatever the miners mine".

A $1mil Bitcoin would be a 17-19 tril market cap.   It will only happen if it "bank accounts" are dead or dying.   And they could be... but that is a huge uphill battle.   Not saying it's impossible, but there will be serious pushback from banks and other entrenched financial institutions if ordinary people start pulling out of fiat in droves.
A 1-2 tril mcap is doable though.   Bitcoin is certainly worth that level, if only because it's at least as good as gold... which is worth $8 tril now.   $350 now hitting $10K is a more realistic level for the next 5-6 years.

The network does fight back... with increased fees.   The attacker bears the brunt of this more than the users, because the attacker must continue to lose money during the attack.

The median income in many neghborhoods in NY is $400k, but cost of living is so high ($40k to send your kid to preschool, $5500 for rent, don't even talk about owning a car, etc.), that many families earning that level (usually it's two earners at $200k each) have comparatively little in savings.   Many I know are heavily in debt ... because they bought expensive condos that may not go up in value.   
With that level of debt, many people earning $400k would thus qualify as "zero" or negative wealth by some measures.... and would be in the bottom percentile of wealth.
I know it seems crazy that a family earning $400K would be in the bottom percentile of *wealth*, but it's a fact.   They are risking bankruptcy daily with unsustainable levels of debt propped up by our government.   It's probably a good move... but it could be a catastrophe for many.

Lightning channels are so much more private.   Even if they're equivalently decentralized as a large block Network would be.   I can't imagine they would be worse.   So the worst case is you get better privacy and s***** decentralisation.  But you still get decentralisation on the main Network even if it's expensive.   So now you have a usable payment layer that's more centralized.   And a still usable but expensive main layer that's more decentralized.   I'm okay with that.  Just about everybody who studied the problem is okay with that.

It's pretty obvious if you just look at the traffic.   There's simply not enough people using Bitcoins to buy stuff and account for erratic traffic swings.    How is it possible for the number of people that want to spend Bitcoins drops by 90% in a week.   These traffic swings seem to be conveniently timed around hype for various altcoins.  
Anyone can spend money to spam the mempool.   That's how Bitcoin works it's permissionless.

It's trivial to fork and attach an 8bm limit.   Larger transactions, of course, would only be confirmed by those with the larger limit, and you could code in that 90% of peers have to report compat with new ver for the larger tx to get forwarded.  That way an incompatible fork becomes very unlikely.  IE: it's a hard fork.   But with a soft deadline.

I'm hoping they don't, because the incentives would then be fully proven to work.   A failing POW will only lead to another POW that will, in turn, fail, leading to a cycle of intermittent failure.   Functional, but not nearly as cool as a "never failing" POW.   That's way cooler.

*its almost impossible for bitcoin to continue to retain value this way*
Nearly everything that "retains" your so-called "real value" is valued this precisely this way.   Gold, government bonds, oil paintings.   Basically everything.   And unlike all that crap... Bitcoin has the *can* scale.   Lightning or drivechain *will* work.
Now, if you're talking *real* value... like land, food and guns... guess what... they don't retain value very well.   Hence Bitcoin.

What's the market cap of the dollar..   Good luck finding it.   There's a zillion notions of "money supply" and nobody has them all in one place.    Broad money is about 80 trillion, but that doesn't include things like government debt -- basically "dollars" with interest that's less than money supply growth.   Effectively... negative interest.   Tack that 63 trillion on and you're up to a  whopping 143 trillion.   Can bitcoin hit a 20 trillion?   Easy.   Why?   Because government debt is shitty and everyone knows it.
Once Bitcoin hits the 10 trillion range it won't be possible for it to have major volatility.   So now you're talking about an instrument that beats govt bonds for interest... forever.   Nobody will care that it isn't going to the moon.   Because everyone holding it will care that it is destroying bonds for interest. 
That's how Bitcoin creeps up to a million while wrecking the debt economy and starting some economic paradigm.   Not necessarily better.   But definitely new.

I guess since fees fell down so much (average segwit fee for 1 hour confirm is around $1.25), people aren't as motivated as they should be.

No, unless *all* miners set soft limits, then *some* miners can make extra money mining the transactions that you prevented... and they will make more profit than you.  That leakage will kill the competitive advantage.
You need a lot of collusion to fix fees this way.   There is a proposal called "Emergent Consensus" that formalizes miner collusion to fix fees.   If you're interested you can check it out.
But yes, miners can collude offline to keep blocks smaller.   Indeed, if they were better coordinated today, they would probably fix them at around $2 per tx... because that seems to be what the market will bear.

1. There's no lag.   That idea is absurd.   Difficulty automatically adjust to the available hardware... whatever it is.  GPUs already exist.
2. Any POW change would not be some stupid sudden cutover.   Nobody is saying that nobody ever talked about that.   Everyone seems to jump to the conclusion that a POW change would be a) sudden and b) catastrophic.   Both of those ideas are just wacky.   No one would engineer a sudden cutover.   And mining would just slowly switch over to the new algo.   An FPU optimized algo would be trivial to implement and the hardware optimization is already in place.
3. Your personal thoughts don't change the indisputable fact that manufacturers of mining chips are the actual miners.   They don't need to sell chips to miners.   When they choose to do so, it's for an illusion of distribution that does not exist.   
4. You need distribution for the coin to be secure.   ASIC manufacturing kills bitcoins security.  Plain and simple.

Exactly.   ASIC manufacturing is a problem that needs to be solved with a better POW.   I have been brainstorming a number of systems.   There are certain problems that can *only* be solved by a generalized computing system and cannot be meaningfully be accelerated by a fixed computing system.   FPGA's will be able to kill with these problems - but that's OK, since FPGA's are accessible to everyone.   We need to get back onto generalized computing platforms.... GPU/CPU/FPGA.

Why would miners vote away profits?  Better off backing fake code like BU, and keeping real, tested scaling solutions from happening.

Yes, I 100% agree.  I just wanted to be clear that hashpower does not "secure your coins" the way most people think.   
It secures against double spends - and that's it.
Anyone who thinks it does more that that - doesn't understand how Bitcoin works well enough to understand the ramifications of a POW change.
A gradual POW change is a great idea for *any* crypto experiencing mining centralization pressure.   
It certainly will not "put miners out of business".   Indeed it will allow miners who today are required to buy ASIC's from 2 manufacturers to buy GPUs instead.   Which most miners would *revel* in.
I mined with GPUs for years.   If the POW changes to GPU again, I would immediately begin mining.   I have a 3 cent KWH provider, and I have all the relationships in place.   And I'm in the U.S. 
The only think stopping me from mining at profit today... is the ASIC cartels.

That works.   If 9 out of 10 algos are cold, ASICs are definitely 10x more expensive than necessary ... and a generalized compute system, like a CPU/GPU, would be ideal.
That's pretty cool.  I like that you don't need to "secure" the other algorithms too well...the point in them is to have a large, diverse code base that is not even running most of the time.... forcing ASICs to be expensive.
But this could also mean far more difficulty retargets.  Since you have no idea what the cold algo's difficulty is.

This algorithm is designed so that any hardware design built will also be saleable to consumers and businesses.   Solving graph theoretic problems is something Google spends millions on every day.   Choosing not to sell your new hardware to them would be foolish, and eventually the Google's of the world will just outpace you.   The point of the algorithm is that it is an np-complete problem the hardware-solution to which is generally applicable to a broad range of real world algorithms.

Yeah, but nobody actually uses other cryptos.   If I want to buy medical marijuana, or if I own a dispensary and the bank won't issue me an account, there's no f'ing way I will use anything but Bitcoin.   Other cryptos just aren't there yet.   Litecoin, which has the largest installed base among merchants, is useless.   Ethereum, which has a big uptake among banks.... is, well, run by a bunch of banks.
Miners want to keep tx fees *as high&amp; as possible, so they are blocking segwit.   Some of them are afraid segwit will keep fees very low for a very long time.

Hard fork, but easy on miners, and prevents exposure to low-difficulty periods: 
Keep the old POW, but the difficulty adjustment changes, so block times go up by XX% every week (gets harder). New POW is optional, and the block times are set to make up for the longer block times (go down by XX%) in the old one... (starting off very hard... adjusted to easier as variance settles down).   Combined block time is always 10 minutes.
When the block times get to a few hours for SHA256 and 10 minutes for the new one, the old POW expires.   This can be scheduled to give people 2 years to get off the old POW and onto the new one.
All of this can be coded up in advance and tested end-to-end on testnet with a single variable that controls the schedule.
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:57:55
Absolutely agree.   But I think it needs to be on the table.   UASF is an OK solution to a shitty problem brought about by a weak POW and a protocol problem incentivising miners to mine fake transactions and small blocks.   0.14.2 will fix covert ASICBOOST ... but then overt will happen, and a POW change might actually be needed to prevent UASF chain attacks.

If u tweeted this, I wouldn't have downvoted
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:48:58
There are many options to improving throughput that do not involve a backward-breaking change.    One example would be a mimblewimble extension block.... allowing a large # of small transactions that accumulate and settle on the "legacy chain".    This could scale Bitcoin's payment channel compatible on-chain capacity 100x or more.   Some day, legacy chain tx could be relegated to large &gt; $100k settlement moves only, with $100 fees.    Typical users would then use MimbleWimble extension blocks and/or Lightning Networks to transact.    
This would allow the "legacy chain" to stay 1MB *forever* - while retaining its relevance, and keep mining rewards high.   Which would be a massive advantage to keeping Bitcoin *uncensorable* forever too.  
@_date: 2017-04-22 18:55:20

See above: my comment was in reference to "fake nodes".   Fake nodes don't mean anything.   I was not talking about substituting the coin.   But exchanges do have to "pick one" if there's a chain split because there's no replay protection.   Some exchanges claim they will support both, but in practice this will fail - because anyone can pick up a broadcast soft-forked tx and steal it on the other chain.   And they will.   So basically, there will be one coin with real balances and a real ledger, and one with a bunch of stolen crap.  You guess which will have value in the end.
If a chain split comes up, I'm moving my coins out of exchanges, and waiting out the rollercoaster.
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:12:36
Yep, as I said - same or maybe less because the actual change is backward compatible (old tx still work, and old miners and nodes wont make segwit invalid tx).   EC is like "fork whenever we don't give a shit" version of forking... no activation, no lock in... just random people getting booted off the network.

Clearly dealing with an irrational miner that controls most of the mining for bitcoin.   
They key problem is centralization.   ASICs are prone to centralization.   And ASIC manufacturers have little incentive to actually sell their equipment.    The history of hardware manufacturing has always been "two major players" emerge.
For bitcoin mining this would be a catastrophic failure.
I'm working on a floating-point-coprocessor optimized POW that could eliminate the need for centralized manufacturing, without using memory-bound operations that would leave Bitcoin's POW vulnerable to botnets.
I suspect Bitcoin will need to move POW in order to scale.   Gradually moving to a new POW over the course of a year can be done as safely or even safer than a UASF.    Because it's a MASF... secured the whole time.
@_date: 2017-04-22 18:54:11

Core devs will not comment on it, endorse it or release it unless major exchanges endorse it first.   Installing it, or even faking it like this doesn't really matter too much.    Calling exchanges and asking them to run it.... that counts more.
If Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit, Kraken, Poloniex, btc-e, etc... all run UASF.... then it will happen whether or not Core endorses it ever.   Core will be forced to merge it in and can claim, rightly, that they had no choice.
Any other move discredits core and ends this discussion.
@_date: 2017-04-18 21:17:25
- Channel open/close should be after accumulating enough that the mining fee is cheap.   I think in real life, it will be a week's worth of tx for most people.
- Have you tried installing a full node from scratch recently on a desktop machine:   the experience *already sucks*.  It took me more than a week to get it working.    Segwit will make this *twice as bad forever* ... while lowering segwit fees to a penny!   
- Raising block size needs to be based on "what users can bear".   Or we need to give in and let miners and exchanges run all full nodes only.   In which case: Bitcoin is no longer an untrusted system.  ( If we implement fraud proofs and they work awesomely... maybe we can go that route.   But that has to happen first. )

Anyone ever look at bitnodes.   At certain times of day, only 64% of the nodes have he current block:
In other words, the network is already having a hard time keeping blocks propagated.   Segwit's 2MB is bad enough and a huge experiment!    People who know networking are looking at this P2P mess and saying: are they crazy? 8MB will *never happen*  
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:54:50
Exactly!   I'm actually working on a "vertex hash" which should be verifiable quickly on a CPU, and leverages the GPU mimicing usage in a video game.   The idea is that the effort required to make an ASIC that beats modern GPUs would be at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than SHA256.
SHA256 basically sucks in every way.   Even a crappy, unbalanced vertex hash would beat it 100 to 1.   Will ASICS happen... sure eventually.   But then the POW can change again... by doin so miners will learn *not* to build custom hardware.   And then we *never* have to worry about state actors manipulating hardware production.

You obviously don't get it.   You can't ... with millions of nodes, change what software *I run* on my computer.   There is no sybil vulnerability when doing a hard fork or a UASF (which is similar).   Also, big vendors have already announced they will not buy Jihan coins anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:57:22
Yes, Bitcoin depends on the fact that miners incentive are *not* to do those things.   With UASF, that incentive is correct.   Any miner choosing to block it will get screwed out of a lot of money.   But as long as I dont transfer Bitcoin during the UASF cutover, I have no reason to worry even if it fails - miners don't have my private keys.

Trust in miners is not how Bitcoin works.  Miners are only honest because exchanges and wallets agree to grant it.
Even if every miners started mining invalid blocks, users would ignore it.  It would be an alt coin.  And that's fine.  
Miners are free to mine anything they want.  But users have to agree to pay for that work.
Miners have to convince users that BU is needed, then users have to upgrade, them they can start mining it.
Users overwhelmingly want segwit first before other scaling solutions are deployed.   You can see this because all major exchanges and wallets support it.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:55:28

Litecoin doesn't need to scale.   It doesn't need segwit.   
It's merging segwit because 1) it's trying to attract developers of lightning networks and off-chain solutions.   2) in order to keep maintenance easy and the code safe.. it just merges everything from core  
@_date: 2017-04-18 21:20:40

IMO: infinite.   any exchange that isn't using :
- lightning or payment channel version of custody  (nobody)
- vaulted storage (coinbase)
- zero custody (localbit, shapeshift)
- simple multisig custody (customer + bitfinex has key, all coins go on chain after a settlement time)
is just waiting to be seriously hacked.
Bitfinex didn't stop using bitgo and start doing more on-chain or multisig custody.   So how is it any more secure than it was the last time?
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:15:50
I meant the intent of using scrypt in litecoin... to prevent ASIC mining from being effective, has been compromised.   Scrypt itself is fine.  
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:58:49
The problem, however, is perception.   Ethereum is currently perceived as faster, more innovative, more distributed and, well, "probably secure".   The "10 minutes" in Bitcoin just *seems* ridiculous when people read about it.   The actual features, wallets, integration don't really matter.  Perception can easily beat "network effects".   Ethereum actually is live and working now.... contracts execute.    Could bitcoin lose all of its market value on this perception?   Yes.   Unless Ethereum is hacked or broken in someway... it really could.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:14:34
Yes, ASICs are the problem.   
If you look at the GPU operations in play during a typical 3D video game, sample them, then build a secure hash that leverages those operations at roughly similar ratios, that, to me, would be the ultimate POW.  It would be ASIC resistant for another 8 years at least.

 1. When the price goes up, you don't necessarily make more money.   You often make *the same* because more miners enter the business... there's more people splitting up the larger pie.
 In fact, the worst is a big increase in price, followed by a small decline.  Because then a lot of people get in, and some of them don't leave when the price goes down.... now even thought the price is higher you are making less.
 2. Right now 90% of my profits is fees!   Before full blocks it was only 10% of my profits.   
I agree, in the long run, blocks need to grow.   But the reason why miners are blocking segwit today - is because it will reduce their fee income.   
Miners are afraid if they approve segwit price will go up a lot, and new miners will get into the business... and then the price will come down a bit and they will be screwed.

No, covert asicboost is *any* tree modification.   You can stuff fake transactions in the tree, or mine blocks that are 95% full and cherry pick what goes in.   It's cheaper to do it with empty blocks, but for only a little bit more time and effort you can do it with full blocks.

Litecoin has a negligible orphan rate... at 2.5 minutes.   So the orphan block issue is really a non-issue.   Changing rate and is a hard-fork.   So is changing block size.   Changing rate has additional benefits, and additional risks (slightly increased orphan rate, increased overall blockchain size)

Very similar to segwit, some of lukejr's arguments can be rightly applied to BIP141:
 - This is a relatively complicated proposal, creating a lot of additional technical debt and complexity in comparison to ... hardforks
 - risk of creating two classes of "full nodes"
 - ... more of a hard-fork ....
Indeed, if segwit was done as a full extension block... with complete tx information located within the extension block ... it may have been a bit cleaner.

Hard forks can *always* be clean.   There is no notion of technical debt with a hard fork.   They are backward-breaking by their nature.    You can say "fuck off" to all your old code... come up with new transaction formats, new everything if you want.   Soft forks allow old hardware to keep working without an upgrade.  
So any time in the future... no matter how many extension blocks are tacked on .... we can hard fork to clean things up.
Also, the new version bits thing in Bitcoin reduces the technical debt accumulated from soft forks... modularizes it to some extent... so that helps a lot.

That's true.   But I still like GPU's.
CPUs are not ideal for mining because botnets become a primary concern.   ASICs are not ideal for mining because centralized mining is virtually guaranteed.

Litecoin has a decent install base, with 759 nodes on the map, and many of them run by small miners.   Pool distribution is poor, but miner distribution is decent - mostly because GPU's remain viable.   
As an altcoin goes, it's probably one of the least crappy, because there was no attempt to pretend at a million untested features.  
It's just the bitcoin code base... with a different PoW and a different block time.   All bug fixes and features posted to core are regularly merged into litecoin... so I know the code has been somewhat reviewed.
ASICs were developed for it because someone figured out that litecoin was a better long-term store of value than other alts.
If Bitcoin ever has to change it's POW, it has altcoins to thank for testing dozens of PoW's in the field.   And soon it will have litecoin to thank for testing segwit live... and dispelling people's fears about it.
I suspect after all the alts crash (except maybe eth... which is being propped up by banks), a small litecoin community will soldier on at roughly .01 bitcoin's value for a very long time.

by some definition all hard forks would be altcoins.   which is silly.  which is why bitcoin classic is not an altcoin.    personally, I think the support for b/c is misplaced.   but, I also think that the core should include a block size increase in the public roadmap.   segwit is more technically important - simultaneously fixing malleability &amp; increasing block size.  but a straight block size increase some time this year is important for PR.   and proving a smooth hard fork is even more important for confidence in the mechanism of upgrading a network.

When Bitcoin mining becomes popular enough to compete with high end GPUs at polygon manipulation, then it would have to be revisited.    Maybe we can stave that off for another 8 years?   
- Generate a large polygon with holes using a deterministic, fractal algorithm that is trivial to verify fits the requirements.
- Produce a tiling of fixed-size trapezoids that fills it.
- If one is not possible... try another seed for the fractal.   
Apparently this is an NP-complete problem that GPUs are very good at.   It uses a lot of RAM, and uses a lot of operations that are heavily GPU optimized.  Verification requires that you prove that a) the fractal follows the rules, and that b) the tiling leaves no gaps.   
It's slow verification though.
I'll think about it.  Really it needs to be a hash algo that heavily leverages GPU operations.

- All major exchanges are regulated by regional authorities to a equal or greater extent than many commodity instruments granted ETF status by the SEC
- An auction price is a far better indicator of true price levels because it is not subject to localized regulatory and liquidity manipulation in the same way that an exchange is.

No, they can't.   Because any miner not in the collusion group can defect.   If only 10% hashpower defects, that 10% would make a lot more money, and fees would not go up as much,


There is no other reason to mine a 0 byte block.  You're giving up 10% revenue.


I do.   Large blocks that propagate slowly will favor miners that are physically closer to the origin of the block, because they will receive the block info sooner.  


And thereby incentivizes people to join larger pools, because there's no latency and less orphan risk.  


EC is a bit of a joke though, right?  There are literally dozens of other block scaling proposals that are better.  Median * 1.05 is better.  
You have to understand that there are two competing needs:
- need to ensure that the protocol remain runnable by a typical desktop user, so that it remains highly distributed
- need to lower fees to make it more accessible
Segwit does a good job of relieving fee pressure for a year.  But more importantly, it allows chained unconfirmed transactions and atomic swaps.    
This will allow Bitcoin to be used for payments...which it cannot effectively be used for now.
BU specifically blocks this and has no plans *not* to block it, so it's really a no-brainer.

1) They have a solution to quadratic hashing: limit the number of inputs in a transaction.   Read about "qmax".   They had a bug in it, but it was fixed.   It's probably an OK solution.   
2) Yes.   It should have a large upper bound, like 10MB or something.   Of course segwit has a 4MB upper bound, so that's already a lot.
3) Yes.

Because the hype is over.   Litecoin is just an example of "see segwit isn't broken".   Nobody actually uses litecoin for day-to-day transactions.    Bitcoin fees would have to hit like $5 or more before anyone starts using litecoin.   The most common use case for bitcoin in the US is buying marijuana and storing marijuana profits in a non-bank.    Average sale is $200.   
$2 fees are fine for that usage, and for ATM-level quality of storage/withdrawal.
If fees keep going up though, litecoin might get more love.

Any POW you select would spawn miners and consume $1200/bitcoin in electricity.   You need mining.   You don't need ASIC manufactoring.   A POW that used a floating point coprocessor to generate streams of CPRNGs would allow Bitcoin to be independent of manufacturers forever.
ASIC manufacturing leads inevitably to a few miners having &gt; 50%.   Name a chip manufacturing business where this isn't the case.  And don't pretend that ASIC manufacturers will honestly sell chips, that has never happened and there is no logical reason to assume it will.

It's trivial what the benefit is, you can work it out yourself in a few minutes.   Here's a hint: every day he blocks it, he makes an extra $60,000.   Guess what fees would vbe if he wasn't blocking segwit?   Most likely, they woudl be 10 times lower.... 4 cents on average!   Because fees only go up when blocks are *completely full*.   
It's really really hard for someone to give up $60k per day in fees now, for some vague future benefit of "more uptake" or whatever.
The real number might even be higher... if asicboost is being used.  Asicboost is 30% of his margin (well maybe 20%, because he has to mine smaller blocks to make it work... and he does every block...), so i don't see why you think it's not important.   
It could mean another $100k per day or more in electricity costs.
Holy crap.   If I was pulling in $160k per day ... I'd do *everything i could* to stop segwit or any other block size increase or malleability fix or witness commitment from being released.    And as long as he's cashing out every day, who gives a crap if bitcoin value drops?
And that's exactly what he's doing.    And he can pay for armies of people to prevent it.

It's based on average mining margins.   If you ever actually mined bitcoin with ASICs at scale in a real data center (i have), then you would know the real number is very high.   It's at least 10x or more in profits for modern mining.

They will have to either (1) stop using ASICBOOST or (2) signal for segwit.   Either way they can continue on.   BU code can be trivially modified for (1) ... so yes, as long as their chips actually work without ASCIBOOST, BU support can soldier on, and segwit can still be stopped.

Bullshit.    This manipulation is why the POW needs to change.  Ideally a series of np-complete graph theoretic algorithms, to which any generalized solution has been proven impossible.  If we select 6 asic resistant algos, this business is done for 10 years.  
Or we can select a polygon manipulation algo.  Guaranteed gpu dominant.

Looks like vertcoin has already done this... bouncing from one POW to another .... once they realized that CPU-dominated POW's are very very bad.   GPU POW's are the best alternative:  Vertcoin uses one that is memory hard enough that ASIC's are unlikely, but still GPU friendly.
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:13:27
Nope.  They don't.   The higher the price is the more mining there is... you split the block reward with more miners.   Please actually do some homework before posting randomly.    If the price spikes, yes miners get to cash out at the high price.   But, overall, it's gotten less profitable to be a miner over the years ... not more.   
I should know.. I was driven out of mining - largely because of the price increases and the resulting increased competition.
The price has nothing to do with Nakmoto consensus.   Miners are honest because if they aren't they *lose* money when they fail to get a block reward.   They are honest because they *lose* money if the price collapses.   But a constant price is ideal for miners.

A POW change to a gpu optimized version would put current manufacturers out of business.   but it would enable current miners to gear up and keep mining.
I think you are conflating two things.   A properly done POW change does not have a "changeover date".   It "ramps up and down"....   IE new POW ramps up (difficulty goes down), and old POW ramps down (difficulty goes up) in lock step.    That's the only way that's feasable... so you guarantee the same level of security throughout.   A sudden cutover is a terrible idea.

That is the least important aspect of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is defined primarily by community, and by the quality of its engineering team.  Secondarily by energy expenditure.   Maybe a little by the POW selected?  I don't know probably nothing important there.  Do a little research on how consensus algorithms work. The community is the most important aspect. The particulars of the proof of work are ultimately meaningless as long as sufficient effort is proven that is all that is required.

Yeah, but nobody said Bitmain is doing this.   All they said was:
- their chips can do it
- they spent money and time engineering the chips to do it
- they are vocally against any protocol changes that prevent it.
That's all true. 
This "feature" needs to be removed - ASICBOOST is deeply damaging to the POW in Bitcoin.   Even the non-covert feature needs to be fixed.   Whole-header commitments in the merkle tree  need to be required ASAP.   If this is allowed to continue, the POW protocol can be irreparable.

Bitmain doesn't have more skin in the game than Bitfury, Coinbase, Gemini.   I bet Gemini alone is worth more than all of Bitfury/Antpool/Viabtc put together.   All the major holders are segwit ready.   Only ASICBOOST is preventing Bitmain from signalling segwit.

Ethereum's POW bomb was not a bad idea and it certainly wasn't "whenever the wind blows" - it was planned from the start.    It's the switch to POS that's the bad idea.    (Well, maybe not for Ethereum, which never pretends to be a currency... it's certainly bad for Bitcoin).
A POW bomb in bitcoin... and POW ramp for a new algorithm would be a clean nice way to get some young blood in the game, return mining to the users for at least a couple years, and restore decentralization.   I think we may need it every 8 years or so... maybe regularly scheduled, safe, gradual - and planned.

I would prefer a POW which involves rendering polygons.... something that GPUS excel at and that any ASIC would lose out to a GPU, because graphics companies have much larger incentives to do this well than bitcoin companies.

Then ... if Bitcoin takes over the world ... we all can have really really good graphics, cheap.

It's actually a terrible idea for Bitcoin to have factories in China making dedicated ASICs - it's proof that the POW needs to change.   A POW chip needs to be accessible to the community, or Bitcoin cannot retain it's decentralized nature.  
POW does not "provide security" in the way you claim.   The primary security is provided by private keys.   I would much, much rather have a GPU-optimized algorithm.  Masses of GPU farms would eat as much value and secure the blockchain far better than dedicated ASICs.   
Indeed, since Bitcoin is sound money, there is little incentive for a manufacturer to even sell his chips.   Instead, he can print and mine... selling only the minimum needed for his overhead.   Which is precisely what Bitmain does... and is why they have so much power over the protocol.
The only objection any computer scientist would have to this claim is: how do we design an algo that ensures GPUs remain the  device, and that ASICs don't dominate in the future?   Not "OMG we need factories in china". 
No developer would ever be like "oooh but sha-256 is so great, we should never change it".   The only objection I've seen to this is "which POW would hold up?".   Not whether.   Only panicky reddit peeps seem to have a problem with a POW change.   Engineers just think it's a problem that needs solving.

1. BU is not a block size increase ... it's a change in rules that miners get to /decide/ block size forever.   Segwit is a block size increase now.   Also, segwit doesn't prevent future block size increases in any way.   So if it isn't enough, we can always have more.
2. Again, you fail to understand mining.   Fees are 90% of *profits* now.   That's because electricity and equipment costs eat up *nearly all the block reward*.  Fees are this awesome unexpected bonus... making up most of my profits, and most of the profits of everyone I know in mining.   And worse, some pool operators *take all the fees* from miners.   Yep.   And they never sent the memo to the equipment owners that fees are now a big cut.   Guess which pools are blocking segwit:  every fee-retaining pool.
3. There is no "miners as a whole".   It's a collection of people.   As price goes up, more people mine, so individual people make less.   Usually it balances out.   But miners, in general, only want price to go up very slowly.  They are the worst people to rely on for protocol changes ... if you care about price.
4. Miners, ultimately, don't want Bitcoin to fail completely.   But also, they don't want it, quite, to succeed wildly.   They profit the most if it remains "OK".
@_date: 2017-04-10 04:36:33

Larger block sizes will kill network reliability.  As it is only 69% of the network can keep up.   Bitcoin went from 50,000 full nodes to 6,000 full nodes - largely because of network bandwidth and chain size.

Miners basically have very little power.   If they mine invalid blocks, nobody will care and the network will ignore those blocks.   This has been proven repeatedly.

Miners *sort* transactions and prevent double-spends.   They do not secure them, nodes do.  If a miner includes a bullshit tx, my node will dutifully drop his block no matter the POW. But, correct.  Need to have at least 51% to make it safe.

Segwit is 8000, not 4000.   And extension blocks can be used to get to 16000 within a year and without a hard fork.
If a hard fork is needed, it will take 2 years, and will require every vendor on the planet using Bitcoin to retool hardware/software to work with the new protocol.   It will be a massive undertaking.   I find it very, very unlikely.

The new chain can be called "Bitcoin2".  
It will have segwit baked in, and a shiny new POW that's secure, and both ASIC and CPU resistant (GPU optimized).
Core devs are prickly enough that it would be very hard to pick that POW though.
You'll need to handle replay attacks, which can be done with transaction version bits.
And tx version bits can double as a signalling mechanism for future user activations 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:07:51
Short blocks are also a smoking gun.   Viabtc and antpool both have short blocks.   Also you can compare each block to your own mempool and build a graph of pools that have tx not in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:20:36


I really do understand it.  I think many people have been mislead into thinking it is not a block size increase.   It is.
Segwit is a *4MB* max block size, allowing *roughly double* the number of tx/sec in practice, and a 2-5% overhead in larger tx.   (Anyone griping about the size of legacy node blocks doesn't understand soft forks).  Old nodes and sigs still will work, but won't be able to take advantage of the new space... so their transactions will seem 2 times larger under segwit - and will be more expensive as a result.
At current usage patterns, you're getting 2.1MB blocks with the a bandwidth/storage overhead of 2.2MB.   This should go down over time though... turning into 1.7/1.8 as people make use of new compressed signatures.   IT's not quite a doubling I think... long term.   But right now it is a doubling... because nobody is using compressed sigs.


segwit makes it so either they all are still valid... or none of them are.  prevents partial "end chain" commits.


Res bandwidth doubles every 4.5-5 years.   Most core devs are OK with doubling every 5 years.   Indeed: BIP 103 is a core sponsored hard fork to double (2.1x) every 5 years.  It's critical block sizes track global bandwidth... not grow in response to some miner-driven game theory (which looks now to be like ... use BU to stay small forever and steal everyone's money).   


Yeah, which is why segwit is exactly right for now.


BU has no neutral stance on segwit.   All BU proponents are blocking segwit.   Indeed BU miners can signal borth segwit *and* BU right now.  It's trivial.  Read r/btc ... it's 45% anti-segwit and 45% pro-BU.   


Well, if segwit was active... fees will drop very quickly.   Like you said... this is a hockey-stick pattern.   A small increase in block size will cause a large decrease in fees. Block sizes are being constrained artificially by preventing an upgrade... and by ViaBTC/Antpool mining 0-byte blocks and "short" blocks (800KB on average...)

Satoshi on Bitcoin scaling
“Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. “

So do we all have to switch to using litecoin now instead?
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:22:30
Nope, I'm not willing to do that.   SHA-256 is NOT securing Bitcoin.  It is absurd to think this is the case.   Energy expenditure is the game theory securing Bitcoin against double spends.  And cryptography secures your actual coins - mining has nothing to do with that.   
Miners can't spend your bitcoin EVER.   Even if a miner has 100% hashpower... there's nothing they can do to get your private key.   All that miner could do is prevent transactions and force us to more quickly and insecurely change POW.   The ledger would remain intact.
If a gradual POW change began today, miners would begin mining the new POW and roll back the old - at an equal energy expenditure.  Why wouldn't they?  What could possibly compel a competitive miner today to stop mining bitcoin, if a GPU version was gradually released over the course of 1 year?   They would just *buy gpus*.   Why not?   They already have the power, cooling and space to do so.
If you want to be perfectly honest, SHA-256 is the least attractive part of Bitcoin.   The quality of the core engineering team and the penetration of the community is primary.   Energy expenditure is secondary.   SHA-256 is just some arbitrary and outdated algo selected 8 years ago.   Changing the POW has *always* been on the agenda for Bitcoin.   Everyone knows SHA-256 is not going to last forever.   As it is, Bitcoin's security is severely compromised by miner centralization owing to a major fault in the POW.  
Maybe now is a good time to fix that.
In fact, if we wait for an emergency... that's the *worst* time to change POW.

Only protects against mining on the "wrong chain".   Not against zero tx valid block mining.   Indeed when mining a zero tx, fees go up, so the attacker is rewarded if they choose to mine fee tx.   Attackers can include their own unpublished tx to avoid the appearance of wrongdoing while maximizing rewards.   
And none of this addresses birthday attacks where attackers generate massive numbers of new accounts while rotating nonces  in order to game the selection algo.

Nope, data stores can be cracked without root via jail-breaking leaks.  The simplest leaks merely trick an app into regurgitating the store....even timing based attacks can work here.
Key rings are typically permissioned and hardened against attacks because they have limited operations and access.
Also, IOS and Android both support native public key encryption that never reveals private keys....including bitcoin-compatible signing operations.

It doesn't really work because fiat, itself, is too centralized.   I can ACH funds in the U.S., but only to a company that I trust, otherwise they can easily rip all the funds from my bank account.   So this limits the number of agents that can onboard for Bitcoin.   Any "decentralized exchange" has to deal with this, and most do crazy things with agents and signatures and escrow that make it too damn hard and slow to buy and sell.
Basically, Bitcoin is solid and reliable... but fiat is so fucked up it's hard to "buy in".   There's only a very small economy of people who work for Bitcoin and use Bitcoin as their primary savings account.   Maybe less than 50k people in the "country of Bitcoin".   
The rest are all speculating.   That's not a stable economy.   What we need are more real Bitizens.
If someone could come up with a decentralized fiat-tethered coin backed by a P2P network of agents and auditors, then we could use an atomic swap network.   And then we could have a real decentralized exchange.   The fiat-tethered coin should have high fees and demurrage to pay the agents.
Could work.   Needs to be engineered correctly though.
Obviously tether.to doesn't work well enough to matter.

I managed an internet company with 200k users once.   Our margins were thin, and our risks were high every day.   If there was a problem with the root servers, we got phone calls.   
If Verizon had a problem in New York.... people called us.   The crazy thing is ... we would help them anyway.   Our tech team literally had to help people restart their modems every week.
Meanwhile we would get hit with DDOS attacks, spam attacks, spam filters, vendors disappearing, *every day*.   At least once every couple months we were hit with a lawsuit over some random account doing stupid crap that wasn't worth $10/year in revenue.
Coinbase has 50 times this problem.   I'm betting it's spam.   Spam is very hard to deal with and getting false-flagged is easy.   If you have 20 referrals ... did you email a bunch of people or post to a lot of forums?   If anyone complained to Coinbase...then they probably banned you.

1. Bitcoin is not a company.   
2. I'm really tired of this absurd comparison. There was little/no risk to the user when moving away from MySpace. Better to compare VHS and Betamax.   Even thought Betamax was technically better, nobody switched because there weren't as many movies to rent.    Plus, companies had already made and investment and didn't want to risk switching.   
3. First to market *protocols* almost always win in the long term.    TCP/IP hasn't been made obsolete by the almost 15 or so forked versions that improve upon it.   Indeed most people don't even know that alternatives exist.  Bitcoin has more in common with TCP/IP than MySpace 10 times over.

Euro rates fluctuate, and generally decline due to inflation.   Holding Euros in large amounts is probably a bad idea.    So you have to use mechanisms to hedge against Euro inflation.   Large car finance corporations do exactly that: they use government debt and sovereign default swaps to prevent currency losses.   But that, itself is *very* risky too.   And catastrophically so.   Because the odds very low of there being an issue, the leverage offered increases in proportion.  So the type of risk they endure is *solely* catastrophic.   The theory is: we on'y lose out if *all* our competitors lose out too.   So that's seen as OK.... 
Right now car financiers are funding Euro and US dollar debt to the tune of trillions based on the assumption of mutually assured catastrophic risk.   Makes Bitcoin look downright tame.

If people don't feel comfortable splitting and selling the price simply will not plummet.  IF exchanges don't provide ease to to so, which they cannot, the price will not plummet.
Here's a more realistic analysis:
1. If Coinbase et al refuse to split ... then most people will simply own B2X and no longer own Core.  Coinbase will swiftly collapse under a lawsuit in this case... a class action that drives them out of business. So they cannot do this.
2. Coinbase and other exchanges are thus forced to split coins to avoid a lawsuit... and this is a *nightmare* without replay protection.   This is the biggest and most horrible split since ETH/ETC.   If history has taught us anything, coins *will* be lost on both sides of the fork.  The brand will gets muddled as DCG controlled exchanges call people's Core coins "Bitcoin Classic or Legacy or something" and all manner of shit ensues as people have *no idea* how to safely move coins .... without losing value on either side.
3. The price of both will decline massively... because Bitcoin has been outed as vulnerable to a fairly inexpensive social engineeering attack.   But the balance will remain on a knifes edge as investors flip flop between Core and Legacy... especially because of serious liquidity problems and an overall fear of "doing anything" before it all dies down.   Hashpower swings wildly between chains them causing block time chaos.
4. Core meanwhile is responsibly considering a POW change every time it appears the chain is at risk of double spends.... but this causes even more price swings - and generally not in Core's favor.
5. Maybe 6 months later after the shitstorm is over, and Coinbase has closed shop, we will be left with a B2X coin that works about as well as BCH today.... and and Bitcoin back on track.   Or, conversely, we are left with a SHA256 B2X coin run by big business and paid devs... and a keccak Core coin which will eventually eclipse B2X in value.

I'm envisioning a p2p network operating a tether coin, where there are KYC identified agents backing the coin and an escrow account that accumulates funds to deal with agents that are unable or unwilling to redeem.   Bootstrapping the network using a set of well known and well identified agents (like the western union network, for example), could make it work very quickly.
I like the idea that agents are randomly selected a deterministic algorithm for 100% redemption on a regular basis, in lieu of audits.   Only with a lot of collusion could that be evaded.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:32:42
B2X doesn't have replay protection.   So the network could be really unstable, and people could lose coins on either side of the chain.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:47:35
Of course, the attacker simply fills blocks at his own expense until the chain is unusable except by a minority of nodes.   Now we have a brittle network with a handful of nodes run by miners.   It's a trivial attack if block size is arbitrarily large.   Then the spam attack can stop.   The value of Bitcoin hasn't changed much, but it takes a data center to run a node.   Yay.   That was an irreversible and stupid idea.

redditor for 4 days:
Coinbase 1.6Bil valuation, in today's dollars, is about 20% less than Paypal's valuation of 1.5 Bil in 2002 (2 billion in todays dollars).   Citibank has a market cap of 187 Billion, and total deposits of 1 Trillion.   Bitcoin total deposits are maybe 40 billion?   So it's got a *way* to go before it's not "early adoption".   
Paypal went 50x (market cap is around 70 bil now), and is now considered mainstream to some small extent.   If Bitcoin goes 50x.... we can talk about whether it's mainstream.   At that level, it will be have global assets comparable one single modern U.S. bank (of the thousands of banks), and its biggest onramp provider will be as big as one single low-valued processor (of the thousands of processors).
It certainly *hasn't* had long enough to get to that level.   It's rise is *meteoric* by any measure  and it still is a drop in the bucket in global valuation.   
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:49:23
Your entire argument can be 100% applied to fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:24:01
Yep.  They apparently paid for fake reviews.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:27:45
It doesn't really work because fiat, itself, is too centralized.   I can ACH funds in the U.S., but only to a company that I trust, otherwise they can easily rip all the funds from my bank account.   So this limits the number of agents that can onboard for Bitcoin.   Any "decentralized exchange" has to deal with this, and most do crazy things with agents and signatures and escrow that make it too damn hard and slow to buy and sell.
Basically, Bitcoin is solid and reliable... but fiat is so fucked up it's hard to "buy in".   There's only a very small economy of people who work for Bitcoin and use Bitcoin as their primary savings account.   Maybe less than 50k people in the "country of Bitcoin".   
The rest are all speculating.   That's not a stable economy.   What we need are more real Bitizens.
If someone could come up with a decentralized fiat-tethered coin backed by a P2P network of agents and auditors, then we could use an atomic swap network.   And then we could have a real decentralized exchange.   The fiat-tethered coin should have high fees and demurrage to pay the agents.
Could work.   Needs to be engineered correctly though.
Obviously tether.to doesn't work well enough to matter.

Running "big node" solutions costs a lot, and an attacker can vastly increase the cost of running the network with no commensurate increase in price to fund the network. The problem is that if block size is arbitrarily large, a well funded attacker can make this eventuality happen quickly.   Even if some miners figure out what's happening, others will be happy to take the attackers money.
I don't doubt that fraud proof and other solutions to make SPV secure and efficient can be found eventually.  And they will be needed, because block size will have to grow one way or another.  Drivechain is just a block size increase in disguise.... it will need a fast, efficient SPV layer to function.
But by making this happen now, we open Bitcoin up to a catastrophic attack vector.   Every other solution should be tried first.

For me, I never use an ATM to deposit.  I only use it to withdraw.   At a typical ATM in a foreign country, I can expect to spend $2.50 at the ATM + $2.50 + average 6.1% hit on the exchange rate (really!)
At a typical Bitcoin ATM, I usually pay average 6.42%, only.   It's generally a better deal.   Also, the rates on Bitcoin ATMs will come down even lower as the market heats up.   Right now there are probably about 1000 Bitcoin ATMs in the whole world.  
Compare that to 3 million fiat ATMs, and you can see that Bitcoin has a long way to go before it can be competitive in this space.
At 100k ATMS, we'll see if Bitcoin is competitive.   If rates come down under 2.5%, a Bitcoin ATM is firmly competitive with even some domestic banking ATMs.  I believe a lot of shops will start operating these at low rates because they encourage spending.

Miners have an interest in preventing the next halving - which wiped out lots of smaller companies.   The next halving can only be prevented if they control the source and make the case that fees are too low to support mining.    Without a fee market, inflation is the only logical way to support Bitcoin.     Fees were artificially inflated by attackers financing a campaign to make Bitcoin appear broken in this way - in order to gain control of the source code.

Exactly.   The rare varietals in tulip bulbs were rare because you *couldn't* fake them at the time.   None of the botanists of the day knew how.   Then there was a breakthrough when it was discovered how to more rapidly breed the varietals.   Supply was booming because of the price.   At the same time demand dried up.   This broke the bubble.   Tulip varietals went from rare to "not rare" overnight.
Bitcoin will, similarly, collapse if it is broken and you can forge or compromise it, or hyperinflate it in some way.   Otherwise... it will not.   B2X is a big test of this theory.   It is the most sophisticated attack on Bitcoin's security to date.   If Bitcoin is still around in December, then it will be a big confidence boost, IMO.

The tulip market didn't crash because of government intervention.  Indeed it was propped up by government support.   Read about it.  The real issue with tulips was that the supply is unlimited, but with a 3 year lag.   When prices spiked, suppliers multiplied their production.   But it takes a long time for new bulbs to arrive at the market.   During that time there was no supply.   Then *before* the glut hit, savvy traders dumped.   Word got out and everyone dumped.
Bitcoin has no supply inbound.   It does have segwit2x, which is timed at the worst possible moment. That is causing more FuD

Incorrect.   
Imagine someone can purchase a contract to sell BTC at $6000 in a month for $100.   When they do so, they can safely go out and buy BTC at $5000, hold in in their account, and have no risk of loss and a *guaranteed gain*.    Even if the price goes down... they're covered .... and if it goes up... they're covered.  
So this enables people interested in purchasing BTC to have an "insurance market".
As people buy into the ETF, that causes indirect pressure on the underlying... because this virtual insurance gets cheaper and cheaper until there's simply no reason not to buy Bitcoin.
This exaggerated example shows how such an ETF can have a MASSIVE effect on the market.   Not small at all.   But the problem is that the overhead of these funds tends to be too big.   If they operate very efficiently, it will all work out great.   If they operate like the USO ETF... with a shit-ton of overhead and profits all going to the ETF issuer... then it will be meaningless.

Normally, exchange traded notes on baskets of underlying instruments have a redemption policy.   So if you're a holder of say $100K of GBTC or some very large amount, you can go to the provider and exchange them for actual Bitcoins.    
Grayscale has no such policy at any level.   So people are trading on the "idea" that these notes represent about 1/10th of a Bitcoin.   Seriously, it's backed by a creation policy that includes purchase of Bitcoin and then floating the new shares on the market in 1 year.   But no redemption.
I called them.

Smart.   It has so far for 15 years, and the rate, 17%, has been fairly constant for bandwidth, so dropping it down to 2% is extraordinarily conservative.   But yeah, if bandwidth begins to decline, Bitcoin will be in trouble anyway in so many ways I can't count.   Bitcoin is rooted in technologies continued advance.
Another way to do this is to peg it to hashpower (POW) using an interpolated graph on the assumption that hashpower has something to do with tech growth - that way if there is a tech setback, of any kind, there will be a corresponding block size setback.    
This might be a shitty assumption, but it's the only verifiable source of technology growth Bitcoin has.   I can try playing with the graphs and see how it looks.

It really is lower than CB.   No withdrawal fee for getting it out of the cash app and using it for real BTC payments, lightning, etc.    should chill.   Looks like about a half a percent in/out.   If real inflation is 5% (which it is), and BTC moves with inflation (some day it will), this is a good way of being "4% better than cash".   And if you use the bitcoins straight, by moving them out to a lightning wallet, for example, then it's 4.5% better.   And if you care about privacy on those purchases... then it's 100% better than using a credit card.

I don't trust bitfinex ever since the "hack" and the USDT oddness recently.    I'm envisioning a p2p network operating a tether coin, where there are KYC identified agents backing the coin and an escrow account that accumulates funds to deal with agents that are unable or unwilling to redeem.   Bootstrapping the network using a set of well known and well identified agents (like the western union network, for example), could make it work very quickly.
I like the idea that agents are randomly selected a deterministic algorithm for 100% redemption on a regular basis, in lieu of audits.   Only with a lot of collusion could that be evaded.

If the U.S. government makes it illegal, the way they made gold illegal in 1935, it could set Bitcoin back many years.     The U.S. is still the largest buyer (i know people like to talk about china, but they are not the majority).
Bitcoin represents the only truly global currency in the world.   It is the only way you can send large amounts of money globally, without an intermediary.   The value of sending millions via an uncensorable ledger is immense.   Swiss banks custody trillions of funds for this purpose.   
Bitcoin is infinitely better than a swiss bank account, and is valued 1/100th of the market cap of a single global bank.    It has a very, very long way to go.    When Bitcoin hits $500k/coin, I will probably start selling a couple.   Until then, my job is just to explain to people why banks and government currency are not useful for long-term value storage.   They never have been, and wealthy people have known this for a long time.

Explain why would anyone make money?
1. When an attacker hits Bitcoin now... fees go up and miners get more money.   The attacker can use the fee pressure to drive users to alt coins or attempted takeovers like B2X.   When the attack lets up, the network fees returns to normal.    During the entire attack, the cost of maintaining the network remains stable.
2. With unlimited blocks, miners will make lots of money too during an attack.   The attack will cost a bit more, maybe 1.5x, but not by a lot because of the shape of the fee curve.   During the attack, many participants are driven off then network.  After 6 months during which "news of the success of the new protocol" is pumped by the attacker, nobody will be able verify a transaction except miners and large businesses.  Then the attack can let up.   Bitcoin is now functionally useless.
We know someone already paid a lot of money to attack the network, so it's not *whether* it will happen, it's *which* of these scenarios do you like better for Bitcoin?

Maybe I wasn't clear.  I was deliberately down-weighting the capitalization of Bitcoin by 50% because of liquidity issues.   If customers wanted to pull 2.1 trillion out of Chase, they can ... with no slippage.   With Bitcoin, the liquidity is rather thin by comparison.   So lowering to 40 bil was reasonable to me (second paragraph of OP).   This is an extraordinarily generous number by the way.   The reality is  much less.
No trader talks about a "market cap" for currencies.   They often will talk about "money supply"... but this isn't the same thing.   We all know Bitcoin's money supply (16 million or so minus loss, which could be substantial).
I stand by both the math, and the statements.   I have worked in finance for 20 years, and specifically FX in the last few years.  I'm sorry if I didn't go into a deep explanation of *why* Bitcoin cannot be valued like a stock.   
But here's a basic reason:   Bitcoin is not a company.   Its value represents the *assets of its users*.   Those assets behave more like "deposits", than a market cap.   They don't move like stocks technically or fundamentally.

There hasn't been any real negative news to justify the drop.   China represents about what, 8-10% of the market for Bitcoin?   And half of that is OTC and still legal.  It was absurdly overreacted.   Real price should be about $4K, 10% less than the $4400 at news time.

Specifically, if the majority of minors begin mining a new chain, and people still want to purchase or use the old chain, without replay protection it's possible that transactions can be replayed across both chains.  So how can you buy coins on the old chain?
This renders the minority chain both insecure and also potentially you could lose your coins on the minority chain if you accidentally spend them on the majority.  
Already we have providers like bitwala and valturo that are going to refuse to support B2X.   And we have other providers like bitpay that insist they will be installing b2x.  
Any mobile wallets will be easily confused into using the majority chain.
So now there are two Bitcoins.   And if you try to spend one and send you the address of the other you could simply lose everything.
The results of this confusion is that Bitcoin will be essentially useless for at least a month.
I cannot imagine the outcome of a hard fork with no reply protection that doesn't result in the minority chain being useless and the majority chain being quite confusing and having lost a lot of value during the chaos.
In addition.... the minority chain will be highly vulnerable to double spend attacks.   
Any responsible developer will advocate a change in the proof of work in the minority.
My guess is bitcoin's price will drop to under $1,000 if this occurs.  Clearly vendors like Bitpay don't give a s*** about their investors value.

Cash has the very important property that nobody needs to know it changed hands, and it cannot be revoked afterwards.     
Bitcoin achieves double-spend protection electronically using a high level of distribution and slow, expensive block times.   This is, of course, much less efficient than cash.
Lightning networks can get close to "real" cash because they are nearly instant, while retaining most the distribution properties.
Without being highly distributed, Bitcoin cannot protect against double spends or "revokation".   This is one of the most important properties of Bitcoin, along with its fixed supply.

If you've ever tried to run a full node during a contentious hard fork, you'd know that peering is an issue, and b2x is nothing but contentious.  
Indeed, because of the lack of replay protection, it could damage Bitcoin more than any other competing fork, airdrop or government intervention to date.

You're both right.   Obviously either extreme leads to a shitty society which is why the best places to live tend to have a bit of both.   I always call myself a "libertarian green", when asked about my politics, and I'm happy to stand by it.   
There are just some things which you need everyone to force each other to work together and pool resources on, and there are other things where that's a horrible, and even cruel, idea.   And there's no hard and fast line or easy way to pick which issues need to be sorted which ways.   
The U.S. has had both socialized medicine for the poor and capitalized medicine for the wealthy for many years.   And it sort of sucks for everyone, but maybe not as bad as forcing everyone to buy into a bloated government system, and maybe not as bad as just letting poor people get leprosy and crawl around begging in the streets.

If Bitcoin nodes are hard to run, then governments can exploit this to censor tx.   So bitcoin devs are looking at ways to keep the bandwidth so low that anyone can run a node.    Lightning network tx are not over the p2p network, so are even harder to censor.   Lightning basically fragments the network ... where higher fees can pay for increasing amounts of censorship resistance.

This conversation was about Garzik getting his mojo back.

Scaling bitcoin is not trivial.   But also, it's not something that a good programmer who contributes regularly to the repo cannot contribute positively to.   I firmly believe, I could, given a full time gig working on Bitcoin contribution for a year, contribute very positively to scaling Bitcoin in a number of ways.   Chain sharding and drive chain schemes have been proposed.... some that might work, but people just don't have the bandwidth to code them up and get them into production.   That's the first place I'd help out if I had time.

If you are paying for a bill, it only takes a few seconds to see that the transaction is signed, correct, isn't RBF, has a reasonable fee and was globally broadcast.   That's sufficient for a restaurant bill, because restaurants generally feed you before you pay.   If you wanted to cheat them, you could just walk out.    
It's not sufficient for, say, buying a car.   If you want to buy a car with Bitcoin, you'll need to wait at least 20 minutes (2 confirms) for it to clear.    Not a big deal though.

I have invested a significant amount of time and effort, and there are plenty of simple tickets and problems you can work on to get started.  Particularly in the cli/rpc libraries.  Working your way up in the code really just involves "trying to do simple things" and then graduating to "harder things".  Like anything else.
I have no doubt that some of the advanced stuff involving merkle trees will be out of reach of many devs.  But who cares?   Bitcoin needs a lot of love, and honestly someone could probably become a maintainer on the merits of consistently improving the GUI and the documentation for years and never once touching the crypto stuff.
The real issue is time.   I simply don't have it.   I toyed with writing a very small amount of code, got it to work, but overall I invested very little time and yet... I learned a lot about Bitcoin in the process.   From simple stuff like the way the config file works, to other stuff involving the P2P layer.   It wasn't terribly hard.   The code is pretty well written and once you get used to the conventions, it tries to be rather consistent.
And the community is *tremendously* supportive of new developers.  I cannot describe to you how patient and helpful the devs were in my own explorations.   And they got nothing in return but a pull request that was never merged.

All of those are "gameable", allowing an attacker to fuck with Bitcoin to the point where it cannot function in a decentralized manner for a very low investment.
If you can figure out what the current rate of technological growth is - so we can scale at that rate, or how to get fraud proofs to work, so SPV is safer, or anything else that will allow Bitcoin to scale safely, that would be cool.
UTXO snapshot hashing could do it, I think.   It would change the security profile of Bitcoin a bit, but overall it could make Bitcoin scale forever.   Seems like it would be better in an altcoin though.

It's not possible for there to be a consensus on the balances and lists of nodes.   The whole point of the lightning network is that it operates without network wide consensus.   That's the reason why it scales.  The best thing you're going to get is an estimate.
I suspect it's trivial to prove that it's not possible to have both scalability and network-wide consensus in a distributed, trustless system.  You can have one or the other.  That's we need two protocol layers.

There is no need for an interactive setup with an m of n scheme.   Only at signing time is there a level of interaction for both musig and threshold schemes.
1. Publishes public key G*xi, G*ki, where ki is a random nonce
3. Xi = H(G*xi) ... Xi is the parties x coordinate, for the purposes of interpolation
3. R = G*k = via interpolation of r1=Gk1, r2=Gk2... (see HomPrf)
4. L = H(X1,X2,…) (see MuSig)
5. L2 = H2(XN,XN-1,…) (see MuSig... H2 is a "second hash")
6. X = sum of all H(L,Xi)Xi (see MuSig)
7. Computes e = H(R | M | X) .... standard schnorr e... not a share
8. Computes e2 = H(R | M | X2) ... a second blinding factor
9. Computes si = ki *e2 + xi * e ... where si is a "share" of the sig, and xi is the private data, and e, e2 are blinding factors
10. Publishes (si, e, e2) as the share sig
Same as musig but a more useful threshold scheme.

I agree, BIP 106 is a concept looking for an algorithm.   "Solution 1" is the right behavior, but I agree - possibly incorrect parameters, and medians should be used.   
If you only look at 2 hours of transactions, it would be inexpensive for someone to flood the network with small transactions, bump up the block size to some phenomenal number over the course of 24 hours, and then, in the new environment, *PWN* all the mined blocks for the next day or so - because their miners were prepared and set up to have the appropriate bandwidth, memory and space.   
So, some backtesting and simulation is needed to arrive at a set of parameters.

FPUs are extremely well optimized and there's a whole industry dedicated to improving them.   There is basically no chance "bitcoin" will catch up to the FPU business for another 10 years.   So yeah.... it's temporary.   But it will take a very, very long time.
A hyper-lorenz attractor is trivial to compute.   Hashing the header with the nonce and using the inputs to a 1 million iteration lorenz attractor would require lots of sequential floating point operations (div/mult/add/sub).   
I tested it in numpy and you can verify 1 million iterations &lt; 1ms.   The cool thing is that the POW adjustment can happen two ways:  one... that the final result has to hash to less than a number (target).   And two : you can increase the number of iterations.
So if there's a leap in quantum compute, for example, you can ratchet up the difficulty *infinitely*... unlike SHA256.... which caps out at low target numbers.   A simple code change that increases difficulty *both* by changing the target and logarithmically changing the number of iterations should prevent a quantum compute attack.   (Exponential increase in compute would cause a linear growth in iterations.)

Segwit is a protocol *simplification*.   You have half as much crap to hash for your transaction.... and all the witness data can be moved off to an extension block.   Even better, you can *change* the witness format to allow new op code, compressed signatures... mimblewimble.... whatever! and guess what .... no change to the base transaction format!   EVERY major change to bitcoin now becomes a BACKWARD COMPATIBLE change - as long as they are enforced by miners and nodes.   
Even better:  imagine a transaction that spends to an address that can only be spent is something happens *on another chain*.   Guess what:  still works....  
Moving the witness data to a separate block makes everything about bitcoin so much better.   It makes bitcoin able to do everything *every* altcoin can do.   I know it's hard for people to wrap their head around, but segwit is a protocol change that is 100% for the better.
And now that Litecoin has it... and theres a 3 million dollar bounty on it and growing every day  ....    we can all rest assured that it's probably not broken in some bad way.
The best part is that exchanges, like coinbase and polo, are getting segwit to work now with litecoin... so when bitcoin signals.... everything will just work the first time.   
It's basically awesome.

If fees are $2, I'll just make sure I top up at $200 or more, so I don't ever lose more than 1%.   That's like an ATM move... perfectly fine.

Nobody would make it unbounded for real (in: in an actual pull req).   Anyone is free to modify their code, add a bound, and submit the modified version as a pull req.  Whoever "they" are can argue about what that number should be.   I think EXT blocks should be bip100'ish... not just unbounded "wild-west blocks".   But maybe unbounded is OK.   Also EXT blocks forgo a light-weight segwit implementation... chaining lightning networks to these new unbounded blocks.
But overall, an EXT block is fine.... just needs some tweaks.   Probably there should be two levels of ext blocks.... a "normal" level which is bounded, and an "unbounded" level which nobody except crazy people that don't care about their money use.

Overwhelming is like ~90% of users right now.   Which, well, is "whelming" at best.   
But there's a handful of miners blocking it, and a manufacturer that can make a phone call to a miner and cajole them into opposing it as well.  The root of all this evil is ASIC manufacturing.   Is there any microchip industry where there isn't 1 or 2 dominant manufacturers?   No.   So why would we expect anything but massive centralization in Bitcoin ASIC manufacturing?   And since manufacturers don't need to sell their chips to get paid.... then we don't get any mining distribution at all.

"Network effects" are losing ground.   More and more exchanges support ETH because of the perception that it scales... even though we all know it does not and cannot.   A rapid adoption of segwit, via BIP148 may be the only solution to miners from blocking an increasingly essential upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:37:38
Why does everyone assume that a POW change must necessarily be idiotic, sudden, and poorly engineered?
1. ASIC manufacture is not a useful industry for bitcoin.   The only effect has been to centralize mining.
2. A POW swap that takes 12 months is more than enough time for miners to pivot and use GPUs or FPUs.
3. All existing ASCIs will be useless within 6 months anyway.  *That's why a POW change needs to be done gradually*  No miner needs to lose investment:   but ASIC manufacturers will be obsoleted.
All POW change proposals that have been floated have 6-24 month dual-POW periods where one is phased out and the other is phased in.

Maybe just hf to code that raises difficulty for sha256 and lowers difficulty for triple sha3 in lock step so the average of their times is 10 minutes.  Starts off with 20 min sha256 and 20  min sha3.  Then sha256 goes to 30 min and sha3 goes to 15 min, then 12.5 and 60, then 10 min sha3.  Each change takes 8 weeks.  Even if sha256 is atracked, the worse they can do is raise fees a bit. 
Phasing it out like that protects loyal miners, hash power security, etc.

Cryptocurrency market caps are not good indicators of value.   Cash and treasuries, for example, are worth precisely the amount stored.   So if you have 1 bil in cash and treasuries ... then you've still got 1 bil when you choose to liquidate.   
That report tries to make a good estimate of liquidity... so the global wealth is "what you can sell stuff for if you had to right away".   
But if you had $1bil in bitcoin, you might only have 0.75bil when you choose to liquidate... because the market will be depressed by your sales for quite some time.   For example: if you tried to sell even $1mil in an hour... you'd probably only get 950K (95%). 
Bitcoin is, of course, much more liquid than others.   If you tried to sell $1mil litecoin in a few hours ... you'd panic global markets for days... and you'd be lucky to get out at 600k (60%).   And litecoin's liquidity is actually pretty good compared to others.
Other cryptos like XRP are so sensitive that market cap is a delusion.  I could probably kill XRP and cause a panic with $100k in well timed sales.

My prediction:
Clayton pushes though the ETF, $4k within 6 months.  Drop back to $2.5k afterward and everyone will talk about how "Bitcoin dropped 40%!" instead of talking about how it's actually up 80% on the year.   
Jihan will *never* segwit.   We will need to fork in 2018, the release of which will be blamed for the panic.  But really it will have nothing to do with that, it will just be profit taking on a precipitous rise triggered by Clayton's ruling.  
Segwit will, oddly, activate at the same time GOT next novel comes out.
Finally back past 4k to $6k by 2019, and people will panic sell for the halving again.   And then Bitcoin will be $10k in 2020, as "oh yeah" halving always increases the price.

@_date: 2017-05-07 22:01:30
Segwit first, then 2mb, that was definitely the plan.   Still is.   Segwit makes a hardfork safer because it addresses quadratic hashing and allows us to study the impact and "takeup" of a block size increase without a backward-breaking change.   It's alreadty shown that 90% or more of the users seem to be "on board" with 2mb blocks...which is cool.
I'd like to see my proposal for node incentives take off before a hard forked block increase.   It's actually a really simple code change requiring no forks ... but it does require a functioning lightning network.
Also, I think if we get a *lot* of economic nodes online because of lightning, then we can safely not give a shit about a block size increase.   So there's lots of good reasons to do segwit first (about 6000 of them).
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:22:11
One man controls most of the hash power, yes.  Bitcoin, and crypto currency in general is essentially broken unless we can prove that Jihan is not the law.  A UASF is the only way to rescue Bitcoin from the grave.  People who don't see that don't understand how important the "distributed" word is in Bitcoin's essential value statement.

@_date: 2017-05-16 20:58:31
UASF is at 4% with weighting enabled. If it hits 51%, were' done.  No miner would oppose an economic majority of users, because their profits would drop so much they would go out of business.
Plus if you really hate segwit, you can just mine legacy blocks until you change your mind.   Segwit doesn't force you to mine segwit blocks.   That's why it's cool.      If 40% of miners support it... then we get a 40% size increase.

Extension blocks are better than BU.    
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:15:50
James hillard's and lukejr's implementation works like this:   if 80% of the miners signal on bit4, then bit 1 becomes required, and also if segwit activates, then a spoonet-styled 2mb hard fork is locked in 6 months.
This is compatible with BIP148.   There is no reason not to do this in fact.

People mining for "BU" are preventing a block size increase on purpose: so they can make more money in fees.

No, you cannot exclude 4 mil per coin.   Clearly you don't understand liquidity.   4 mil per coin is 100% achievable if 99% of the coins are "held" and only mined coins are being sold.   Bitcoin simply isn't very liquid, and many hodlers buying in at $1000 are waiting for 10x gains before they sell anything.   That attitude will only get worse as the price goes up.   If it gets to the point where the *only* people selling are miners.... then you have it:  4 mil per coin.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:26:58
Changing POW is perfectly fine and can be done safely.   The selection of POW is meaningless ... Bitcoin is an immutable ledger.   Every other feature is secondary.   SHA3, for example, is very secure - moreso than sha256.  Add in wtxid commitments and a commitment to prevent header-spinning you have have a nice POW that anyone with a GPU farm can immediately mine at massive electric consumption.   
The ASIC race can start again, and this time the vendors will not fuck with the users... because they will remember what happens.
And it can be phased in slowly so that it doesn't disrupt existing chip owners (60/40,70/30,80/20,90/10,100% new pow over 12 months)
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:01:22
This is not an attack.   No matter how many tx you send, they will simply be ignored because they are below the lower bound.   And they will not raise the fee, because fee calcs are based on the percentile, not the average.

Actually, luke-jr said today that he thinks a block size increase will happen after segwit.   I also think so.   Doing them both at the same time is a bad move.   We can use the tested code we have... see how it affects things, and use the data to plan a proper HF. 
Who cares what people "believe".  If users want larger blocks, they will hard fork away core in a week.   If core wants to keep it's position as the maintainers of the reference implementation they have to do what users want.
If segwit doesn't deliver the low fees and higher aggregates that people want within a few months... then users will demand a hard fork *very* quickly.
See this poll: coin.dance/poli

Jihan is blocking the only scaling proposal with any community support so he can stuff fees in his pocket.   If that's not hostile, I don't know what is.
Specifically, he has reneged on an agreement to approve this proposal, provided that non-witness blocks are scaled shortly after.  And core devs have shown every intention of approving a BIP103 like proposal to scale up to 2MB non-witness - shortly after segwit is approved.

@_date: 2017-05-09 04:56:57
Well, Jihan and co hold 51% of the hashpower now.   So they can prevent segwit blocks from being used on the main network if they like, just by ignoring them and mining as if they don't exist - effectively destroying the network for other miners...erasing their transactions and replacing the blocks with their own.

No, this will never cause forks because the algo is consensus based.   Bitcoin Unlimited/EC is shit, but other proposals like BIP100, or adaptive sizes are deterministic and clients will seamlessly upgrade.
Realistically, BIP103 with a 2MB cap after 1 year lock in and 2 years of growth is probably fine.   And all we need to do is code it up .... deploy it only if it's clear that users accept it.

bitcoin is not sha256.   sha256 is a 10 year old hash that's in the process of being made obsolete by sha3 .  bitcoin happens to still be using it.    bitcoin can switch to sha3 and work every bit as well..... but then we'd start the asic race all over again... which would suck.

WOW: I did the a similar thing a year ago.   I paid it all back already.   I don't regret paying it back.   When Bitcoin hits $3k.... pay it back.   
I would pay it back when you double your money... then sit on your free bitcoins for the next 10 years, while accumulating with your savings.
Ultimately Bitcoin's long-term store of value should be worth 5% a year...    All this doubling and tripling can't last forever and you can't time the market.   Maybe it will asymptote at 100k/coin, maybe at $2.5k/coin   ... you never know.

Why should "size" be the only thing that changes?   Why not speed?  I always find it confounding that speed is never discussed seriously.   Faster blocks keep latency stable, improve throughput.   It has been demonstrated, ad nauseum, that orphans are not an issue until you hit 2 minute blocks.   So why not increase speed instead?   Going to 5 or 2.5 minute blocks with reward reduction to match would result in net-same coin production, stable latency, and some better mining distribution (lower difficulty per block).  # of confirms will have to increase, but we know that security actually improves (because it's exponential) when you go to lower speed blocks (2x10 minute confirms are worth 3x5 minute confirms).

wtxid commitment is a clean upgrade to the protocol that prevents covert asic boosting.   it should have been done a while ago.   might be too late now, because bitmain will do everything it can to stop it....

If it reorgs once non-signalling miners will panic and adopt as they watch their profits evaporate.   33% is sufficient for that to happen with a high likelihood.   Thing is .. they already know that.   So 33% will turn in to 100% very quickly (just like the last UASF)

No amount of money can buy the node Coinbase uses to approve bitcoin transfers.   When a miner wants to sell his rewards, and pay for electricity he goes to an exchange or maybe directly to an electric company to do so.   
And if that exchange or electric company doesn't recognize his block as valid.... then he wasted his hashpower.   So miners can only mine blocks that *economic nodes* say are valid.
That is how bitcoin *has always* worked.
  has a good estimate of economic node support, weighted by estimates of purchasing activity.   There is no way to track the real results... but ultimately miners know who their big buyers are.   
If coinbase/gemini/itbit/kraken/polonmies all say UASF... hashpower *will follow*.

no way to "fork away" if you can't store a 200tb block chain.   no one will run your fork.   but yeah, there's really no reason to pretend to cater to poor people that can't afford a 1tb hard drive, while simultaneously inflicting them with $2 network fees.   it's kindof a bullshit argument.   
instead we should be finding ways to incentivise full node hosting.   and i think there are some pretty cool ways to do that.   for example:  you could *charge* people to serve the blockchain.   full nodes right now do it for free... but if 1mbit was charged for a download... or something like that, in the default client.   Probably a lot more people would do it.
if the default client requires you to have a wallet with bitcoins in it to download the block chain that would be crazy in one sense.    but not crazy in another.

Yeah, the last time it was a 8x rise from $120 to $1000 in a few months, followed by a crash down to $200 again.   Still overall, if you just held on that was an 80% increase.   But lots of people panic sold and panic bought all the way up to the $1000 high... losing a lot of money in the process.
I'm probably going to ditch if it hits $6k in the next couple months.   I figure it will fall back to $3-$4k from anything that meteoric.

Suppose you want the same share.   If the price goes up, you have to spend more money on electric to keep your share.  You may have to buy more equipment too.   The margins are in the mining business are very low.   So now you have to deepen your investment just to retain your share.... or you can try to mine with what you have... and get a smaller piece of the pie.
Either way... if you were just holding bitcoin when the price goes up... you'd make a lot more $$$.   And at the end of the day I personally was *driven out* of bitcoin mining because price increases typically cause narrower margins.   Most small miners are.
There is another essential problem with the ASIC business.   Manufacturers have a strong incentive to mine their own equipment before shipping it.   So when you buy, you always get late shipments... and much less profits.  
Eventually, only manufacturers will mine.   And Bitmain has the ability to remote shut down your miner if they disagree with your use of the equipment.  They have full control over all of their customers equipment... remotely.
So there is no illusion of decentralization.

Pay them for services rendered.  First, bake in lightning payment for services:
Services that can optionally cost money:
 - Historical block requests 
 - Fast transaction relay
 - REST api requests
 - Wallet monitoring
 - Chained unconfirmed monitoring
 - Lightning routing
Bake in *all* of these services so that anyone can spin up a full node, and set the price for their services.   
Then watch node count soar... and the node quality will be people who are investing in businesses... not hobbyists.
Also the network will be DDOS resistant... the cost of an attack would be too great.
Business will pay to use high quality nodes.   And a REST API enables cloud service deployment without requiring hosting.

Verified public declarations of support by major businesses.   The "weights" are based on coin.dance's own estimates of importance, but I think they are quite accurate.   For example, Bitmain has a massive weight, and so does Coinbase.   I think they do a very good job of being accurate and impartial.
You can see most businesses are strongly opposed to EC, are in favor of a block size increase, and are largely in favor of segwit + block size increase.
I think most people want to see what Barry Seibert said: segwit + 2mb.   The 2mb being phased in via BIP103 like logic would be amenable to most people... and of course it can be accelerated if needed.

Useless sig attack is weak.   Because all it can do is very very expensively grow the block chain.   High valid time is cheap, because you don't even need to mine a TX to have it fuck up a node.   
No, there's no hashpower majority needed to create big tx.   If we go to 2mb, any miner can mine it.   There was someone who tried to do it with 1mb blocks recently and it was 25 seconds to validate.   If someone can get that up to 10 minutes....we're toast.   
If we do segwit first, and then make larger blocks segwit only... then we have no risk of these attacks, because segwit is immune to them.   Which is one of the about 20 good reasons to do it first.
I firmly believe core will fork to a larger block shortly after segwit.   Something like BIP100, but with utxo bit voting and maybe a burn ... instead of miner voting which is broken (for now) due to asicboost.
I think also once we clean up asicboost, the miner voting problem may go away.

The idea is that burns go to a "burn pool" in memory, and burns from N blocks ago are selected as valid for the current block based on the current transaction hash and height using a CPRNG.   As burns are selected they are removed from the pool.   
Any miner, if their burns are "selected as valid" to mine a block, could choose to mine no transactions at all - even if it's not clear that those transactions are burns until after the signature proof.   
If he does so, and does so for N consecutive blocks, then he can "strangle" the blockchain by preventing all future burns.    
If a miner burns sufficient coin, it's possible he can bring the entire blockchain to a permanent halt.... where there are no more burns in the "burn pool" for the algorithm to select from.
Yes, he loses all of his investment.   And if N is sufficiently large, and difficulty is sufficiently high...this could be quite a substantial sum.   And, sure, the idea would be that a rational actor would never do this.... but still - a sufficiently motivated and wealthy attacker could completely kill a self-referential chain.
Of course this assumes that the actor has a very high percentage of burns... as much as 95% or so - or else other burns will leak into the chain, and kill his domination of the system.   Still once the chain is killed... it's permanently killed.
Now if you bootstrapped this off of the Bitcoin blockchain, then you could solve this problem trivially.   But then you'd be entirely dependent on Bitcoin to protect against stagnation attacks.   If you accept *either* chain burns, then you'd wind up with a one-way peg coin that's very efficient.

EC is not a block size increase.   Segwit is.   EC is basically a broken protocol that only an insane person would actually install - indeed it's biggest proponents never even use it... they just stuff things into a version string and call it support.  No major exchanges or users have support for it... so EC is a vote for "1MB forever".

I think devs didn't account for the amount of time it would take to activate.   If we had 2mb 6 months ago, we'd all be busy testing our new lightning daemons, and talking about the next mimblewimble-enabled extension block soft fork.   Instead we're still dicking around waiting for miners to live up to their part of the bargain.

Yep.   Big 32MB blocks are even worse though.     Big blocks get you all of the centralization pressure, none of the speed (32x vs 1000x, massive latency problems leading to network-related difficulty drops), and none of the censorship resistance.
Without segwit lightning will still happen.   But it will be hub and spoke only because you need  segwit to run smaller nodes.  Some CC processor will do something like this to kill off competition and merchant adoption of direct lightning tx.

With too many pruned nodes... you can prevent new nodes from coming online by DDOS the full nodes.      And even a pruning node will take 30 days to come online .... in a future where 10MB is the norm.    That's probably too long to "come to the defense" of anything.

Segwit would double growth.  And it makes a hard fork safer.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:38:21
No they said they would do signal segwit and then we would do a 2mb hard fork.   And BIP103 is sufficient to do that (sipa recently commented on it so I know it's on the radar), but miners aren't signalling.
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:56:28
It's enough to drop the fees on most tx down to 10-20 cents (possibly lower... hard to tell).   Which is good enough for most people for at least 6 months.
There is no other solution out there that can lower fees as quickly.   "BU" is not even a block size increase - it's just totally fake - miners signalling it are actually using core.   Plus it has no activation threshold... or replay attack protection, and even if it happened, it would be contentious... leading to 2 bitcoins.   Nobody wants that.
"8MB blocks" is probably mined for real... but if activated the network would crash quickly, since there's no proper sigop-limiting implementation.
There's basically nothing else out there that can possibly work.   Segwit has 90% of uptake with users, and 100% of the major exchanges already support it.   
We need it now.   The next increase will take a year to get working.

Jihan is blocking the only scaling proposal with any community support so he can stuff fees in his pocket. 
Core devs have shown every intention of approving a BIP103 like proposal to scale up to 2MB non-witness - shortly after segwit is approved.
Yes, Bitcoin protocol is being "somewhat" held hostage by an ASIC manufacturer.   *Every* other POW crypto is vulnerable in the same way.   Bitcoin is just the only one worth attacking.

What does RPi have to do with anything?    Gemini has full nodes.   These full nodes dictate which blocks Gemini will accept and what the valid chain is for users wishing to buy millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins.   I doubt they run on RPi.    Purse.io also operates full nodes, and again, they dictate the valid set.    Miners are not the "backbone" that provide all the security.   They are an important contributor to security.   Nothing more.
If there was some better magical way of trustlessly protecting against double-spends.... miners would be out of a job very quickly.    Nobody *likes* paying miners for the security they provide.   We just do it because the alternatives don't work (yet).
For a non-working example see proof of burn:
  1. burn happens regardless of whether you successfully mine.
  2. miners cannot know which tx are burns in advance of proof
  3. the majority of burns cannot be used for mining and are simply lost (poisson distribution)
  4. burns are only usable for a short time 
  5. burn involves real risk: every bit as much at stake!
(There is a fatal flaw in proof of burn though... and it's not obvious, and it's not sybil or a POS flaw.   But it doesn't seem to be a fixable problem to me).
However, if you can fix all the flaws in proof-of-burn, then you're done.   Mining no longer needed.

There's a trivial way to measure economic majority.   Tag UTXO with version bits using an OP_RETURN baked into the bitcoin core client.   When 95% of the signal hits... activate a feature.

@_date: 2017-05-06 22:34:52
That's "a" bottleneck.   A bigger problem (for me) is the amount of time it takes to spin up a new and fully trusted node: 130 GB of p2p download + cpu killing validation.   Any block size increase makes this twice as bad.   But segwit, fortunately, is less expensive to validate... so at least some of this problem is made better for the future.

At 19%/year - an optimistic estimate of average bandwidth growth ( range is 17-21/year.)   So, if we started today with segwit, 32MB is doable in about 16 years.    That proposal was put forth in 2015, by u/nullc, I think.  Still is to my knowledge.   But it's the best one out there and has a high chance of being merged in if someone worked on it.  I'd be happy to try and take Luke's version bits and put it together with the old BIP103 and see if we can ressurect a non-witness scaling solution that doesn't suck.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:57:40
UASF doesn't change the supply.    If there's a chain split it will be resolved with a reorg that destroys the other chain.   Because of the nature of the code, the chain without UASF needs to have 2/3 hashpower to prevent losing all mining rewards.   And the opposition simply doesn't have that hashpower.

Would you be OK with a long-lead time hard fork as a greg/luke BIP103 style?   Core devs just updated the spec.  I think far more people would be on board with that plan.   Might not be "enough" for some big block crazies, but I think it would probably be a great middle ground.
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:52:34
- There is no meaningful definition of block size increase that does not include segwit.   Miners are making 15% of revenue and a large multiple of profits off of fees now.   It's very hard for them to vote against that.
- What makes you think that "app developers" are the only possible alternative?   POW is not a voting system.  It sucks for that and shouldn't be used for it.  POS makes more sense for voting...it's fairly trivial to implement (*attach bits to UTXO*  ... done).   And if you can hit 95% ... it's a lot better than POW voting.

If bitcoin fails to uasf in Aug I am convinced that eth will take over.   Even if it is centralized.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:31:59
Segwit is safer because of quadradic hashing problems.   Segwit sigs pack more data into less space... so they solve the problem of space more elegantly.   Segwit also allows up to 3mb blocks for side chains and lightning networks to scale up.   It also discourages UTXO bloat, which is critical for scaling.   
2MB non-witness block is OK.... but it is more complex, because you have to fix all those problems some "other undefined way".   You can't just change the variable.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:40:19
segwit is technically 4mb.   and BIP103 which greg proposed and miners shot down is technically 8mb with segwit.   so can we call him ... 8 meg greg?   the only people stopping scaling are miners... and the people who thing otherwise are brain dead idiots.

i think the idea is that in order for uasf to fail, it must be attacked with enough hashpower to prevent it thoughout the entire activation period.    if it is not fully attacked, then there will be enough orphaned blocks on one side... and not the other to coerce miners into activating it.   and any reorg that does happen can only favor a uasf miner...his blocks are valid on both chains.    the problem is that the hashpower attacking is wasted.    so if you have 34% ... an the attacker loses.   you might also lose!   34% is not sufficient to use segwit, of course.   even if activated, i would wait a few weeks for hash power to settle down before using segwit tx (personally)
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:35:05
1000 nodes is a great start.  Fortunately we don't have to "fork" to get a new routing algo.   Once traffic hits hard, we can see how they scale.   A* should be fine for even 1 mil nodes - OSPF (essentially A*) is fine and is used at scale for many purposes.

Blocks will always be full from now on.    A "not full" block means that fees for some tx are 1 sat.   Most miners already have minimum fees configured ... nodes as well.   Bitcoin is simply growing much faster than we can grow the block size... under any even radical scenario.   Even if XT miraculously became the accepted standard... it would not keep up.
The new normal is:  if you want transactions to clear in 10 minutes - pay the median fee.   Anything less and you risk your transaction getting stuck for longer.  
User bandwidth is increasing 17-21% per year (Based on the last 5 Akamai global reports).  Bitcoin simply cannot keep up with demand for low-fee tx.   That day and age will not come back.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:47:22
Right, techncially it would be 4MB effective 8mb limit.   But real usage would be more like 4MB.   So now it's nice and confusing.

I don't get the whole "core is one entity" thing.   Has any developer that isn't a nutjob actually tried to submit stuff to core?  They are level headed and reasonable for the most part.   
Anyone who is a decent dev is accepted immediately into the group.   Everyone else is rejected... and so you're left with an "angry fringe" ... and what code are they going to write?   I mean I actually like FlexTrans in theory.   It's just too hard to do it right with the resources we have.   
I believe a hard fork, if any, will be a POW fork.   Really.   There's basically no other reason to backward-break bitcoin unless miners start to behave irrationally.   Bcoin proves we can scale on-chain without hard forking... so why do it?

- Right, I should say "it's very probable" Jefferson did this... it is the most probable explanation of the evidence.
- And there is not a core dev out there that doesn't think block sizes will have to be bigger some day.    It is likely Bitcoin will fork - if it does - to a slowly growing size (i think 20%/year is appropriate) that will keep up with bandwidth growth.

As someone who has done most of those things and, has appropriate degrees and industry and bitcoin experience, I can say that BIP148 will be a non-event for most users.

Alts have basically no liquidity and over 90% ownership by a few holders.   A single seller can drive them to zero and cause a panic.

Right now there's going to be an issue ono matter what. 
A number of users already signaled 148. And a number of miners already border it. So the question is how many people will be affected and will it be a negative effect. 
By failing to provide an option in core, we force users to download binaries frim other sites.   And worse, it becomes harder for people to back out.  And even worse, it becomes a more likely split.
Since segwit is a backward compatible change, the safer option is simply for everybody to signal.  Only 33pct hash power is needed for enforcement.
And miners will choose the safer option.

This "trust" is well founded, because thin clients verify shallow chain of X blocks and proper mining of those blocks.   Anyone trying to scam you from that random node would still have to actually physically spend the money mining X forged blocks and offer that proof of work.   Today, this would be a lot of money.... compared to the amount stored in a thin client wallet.  You could safely store $100k in an SPV wallet for "walking around money" and only verify a handful of blocks - that's negligible "trust".

Bubbles always pop when the supply increases.    With Bitcoin this is not possible.   Also, volatility reduces when supply increases.   With Bitcoin this is .... also not possible.
Bitcoin, amazingly will be able to *remain volatile* forever.  Even at a 1 tril market cap... I predict BTC will remain volatile - with massive 10% swings and hundreds of billions of value created and lost on a bad day.   Just like futures markets with their quadrillion market cap.
Which means it will remain appealing to speculators... who will increase volatility, hoarding and price.

@_date: 2017-05-21 15:15:15
Blocks are segments of data included in a block chain.   Segwit increases the size of the total chain you need to download in order to be a fully validating and listening full node, the size of blocks you need to receive, bandwidth used, etc.    So from that perspective, it has many of the risks of a 2mb old-style block.
The advantage of segwit is that a good deal of effort was put in to mitigating those risks:   segwit makes schnorr sig upgrade (any upgrade to witness blocks at all) much easier.   Also it is bundled with compact blocks - which can reduce bandwidth by about as much as segwit increases it.
I just want more people to realize that segwit is *every bit as much a block size increase*.   And please only signal things like UASF if you are OK with the risks that may entail.

And the only justification for this is some of tweets from 2015? And a theory that somehow activating segwit will prevent all future increases.

@_date: 2017-05-07 21:56:54
Their position was 0 block size increase until decentralization was better solved / tx compression of some kind was implemented.   Segwit was introduced to appeal to the btc classic people... a 2mb increase.   Then the classic dev ditched, refused to help out with the code, and started pushing "flextrans" ... a hard fork proposal which has some merit but would require years to implement correctly... and isn't worth what you get.
I think if he had just said "ok, i'm on board" and actually helped... this whole thing would be over by now.

@_date: 2017-05-17 16:06:34
Yeah, it's pretty simple to limit this.   Indeed, we could limit TX to 500k just to be on the safe side.   The real arguments against increasing block size are more to do with centralization pressure, and pressure to grow blocks beyond what users can afford to run... without incentivizing them.
Right now a listening node hits 500kbit at a busy time.   Segwit alone will cause that to hit 1mbit... which will kill most "casual" users... interfering with other uses of bandwidth.   But at 8mb non-witness... the 8mbit will render even most merchants that accept bitcoin incapable of running a full listening node on their web servers.
I think we should give layer-2 solutions a chance ... enable segwit.   But within a few months, we need a pull req ready to grow block sizes up to at least 2mb non witness in a gradual and responsible way.   Maybe a slightly more aggressive version of BIP103.

I thought to do the same thing. I mean, there's got to be a market for the crypto love banks love.   If only for interbank stuff. Thing is, I actually tried to use and trade using their system.   No downloadable wallet.  Source code is a tangled mess and I suspect is not complete.  The whole thing convoluted, illiquid, and just weird to use.
I do believe banks may play with it.   But if I was a currency trader, I'd rather just use a Bloomberg terminal.  If I have to trust someone, might as well be someone with a lot of reputation to lose.

That B.S.  will never go away.   BIP100 isn't ready for prime time... and it is *not* a replacement for segwit.   It can be "in addition too", but miners have already demonstrated they cannot be trusted to dictate consensus changes.   So users would never install something that is miner-dictated.
Why not have users vote on block size by signing transactions - and proving control.  A proof of stake is acceptable to me for consensus changes.
No national government can manipulate whether major exchanges support segwit , if you think so you have no idea how bitcoin works and are not even qualified to talk about it.

- Christian Decker: Blockstream
- Jonas Schnelli: Actually not blockstream!
That's fairly biased.   And should be corrected.   Bitcoin core development (EDIT:) *appears to have been* strongly biased toward one team and this has been a major selling point of alt-forks like segwit2x.

Bitcoin *most probably* has a massive loss rate, in addition to being non-inflationary.   The loss curve is, likely, inversely proportional to the inflation curve, with most lost coins happening in early days when techniques for cold storgage and multi-sig were not being used.   I suspect it's a bigger number than most people think/

Even at full speed timer warner new york on a modern core i7 computer it will take you 3 days to spin up that node, during which time the old laptop I chose to run it on is slow, and the kids can't watch movies because the connection is spotty (very bursty I noticed).
Then, from then on you need a 0.5 MBIT connection at home to be a listening node.   That's in *spare bandwidth*.   
If you've a standard connection, that's about 10% of your downstream and half of your upstream during busy times.   And when there's a spike or a DDOS, that's it... you can't watch Netflix and your dinner-and-a-movie date is ruined.
Now take all those problems, multiply them by 10 and see how many users still run a node.
Home users will drop out immediately, but:
How many merchants have 5MBIT to spare on their connection at their marijuana dispensary?
How many merchants have enough CPU to handle validation of the transactions being broadcast to every node?
Basically at 10MB you will be left with "bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin businesses" running all nodes.   And censorship resistance is completely over.
Consumer and business bandwidth is most of the problem.   That's why SEGWIT+BIP103 is the best solution: it is slow, but not too slow, and the users should be able to adjust over time.   
**Segwit multiplies this by 2 .... slowly  ... over time.**   
That's something I'm *barely* OK with.  *Node incentives must come first before the next increase.*
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:13:51
We don't get attacked that way maybe because it's not effective enough to do so.   It's certainly more effective and affordable at 2mb.   I think it's possible to hit 10 minutes of validation time with 2mb if you craft it right with one very large transaction and there's no sigop limits.
Of course, miners could just refuse to mine it.   But after that you can play games with the relay network too, with very large single transactions.   And the mempool gets attacked weekly...."stress tests" they are often called.   But each one seems more effective than the last.   
At 2mb, they may be *very* effective.   We don't know.  Segwit is risk enough.

Inflation is dropping to near zero in only 10 years.   It's already lower than all fiat currencies.   If we dont have a multilayer and well developed fee market by then, Bitcoin is over.
I'm not in this for quick gains.   I'm in this to retire in 20 years as a wealthy man who only spends his coins when he needs to pay an electric bill.
If you care about long term health of bitcoin and you want it to remain inflation-free, you need a very healthy fee market, and multiple layer solutions for off-chain transactions.
I think we should probably go to 2MB non-witness in the next 2-4 years.   That should buy us enough time to get lightning networks or side-chains up to scale.   It would be good if the 2MB was introduced by a BIP103 like percentage increase... gradual pressure on nodes is much better for the health of a network.
When Bitcoin begins to threaten fiat currencies, we should expect massive political attacks (like this recent NSA "leak") on Bitcoin.   When that happens, we'd better be prepared to focus on : node distribution, ddos prevention, off-chain transaction security, etc.   Fortunately core-devs are precisely as paranoid as they need to be.

Really?  When miners ship late, and have back doors in your system... that's nicer?   Do you work for Bitmain?
Honestly, I don't know if I ever mined a coin with all that hashpower.   I mined with eligius and (later) p2pool, and ran 2 nodes, just to keep the "network up"... because I felt like an investor and contributor.   And it was profitable at the end, because I sold off the GPUs on ebay.
When I did cointerra, I sold the boxes on ebay too... but they were worth way less than I sold them for and I felt like a jerk.  (But then again, that's what manufacturers do to their clients all the time).
It's the same reason governments should incentivise home ownership... people care more about their community when they own.   And holders care more about bitcoin when the mine.

Lightning makes it more affordable for more people to do transactions - increasing usage and on-chain fees.   
The only thing miners could legitimately object to is that segwit increases block size: which will reduce fees.   I get that objection, but it's very short sighted.
I think it's obvious that segwit, at this point, will massively increase bitcoin adoption, price and long term prospects.   Preventing it as a miner with a significant investment is only rational if you are heavily invested in an alt-coin.

@_date: 2017-07-05 15:46:24
Fair enough.   
So then you agree that those businesses for whom the latency and bandwidth requirements are too expensive will be at a disadvantage, missing out on all transactions for whom the fees are insufficient to cover costs.
Do you see how this creates pressure for miners to locate themselves geographically near other miners... and join larger and larger pools.... so that they have no latency issues?
Right now, how long does it take for a merchant to start up a new full node?   Typically, about 4 days.
If there was only one region in the world where mining pools were maximally profitable... would this be an issue you think?   Would Bitcoin be OK?
If users and merchants and online stores who are not miners cannot validate the blockchain, would this be OK?  How would they know if a transaction was real?

Core has repeatedly stated it plans on including in a block size increase in the next hard fork.   And that the hard fork will also likely include many other needed features - opcodes, header changes, etc.   
Core devs do not thing the "current block size" is essential to security.   However if it's possible to keep the current block size, and compress the protocol in other ways.... it should be done as much as possible first.   Of course, because that's a win win for all involved.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:38:01
It depends on how you define spam.   
- With the additional capacity it will be slightly harder to drive up fees.   But only slightly.   
- Segwit does make transactions cheaper, so there will be more of them.    And people like SatoshiDice can get back in business.  But only for about 3 months...before they fill up again.
- It will be a lot easier to conduct a "bloat the blockchain attack".     This kind of attack is very expensive, however, and basically useless (doesn't hurt much), and has never been done before.   It's not really a risk I personally think matters, but is all anyone seems to talk about.

Guess 2 : Gavin is no longer a credible witness to anything Bitcoin related.  Maybe because of some malingering issues with core/xt/classic, or something to do with his new advisory position at DCG.

Removing the limit completely would enable an attacker to bring down the network trivially so that's not an option.   Miners would never vote for this option.
What makes you think that "app developers" are the only possible alternative? POW is not a voting system. It sucks for that and shouldn't be used for it. POS makes more sense for voting...it's trivial to implement and works great.


I said POS for voting.   Meaning you can use bits attached to UTXO for voting in soft forks.   That's still bitcoin.   And it is easy to implement, because I've been working on it and it's not that hard.   It requires 32mb fo ram to deal with 8 proposals at once and it uses log-compressed bitcoin values to keep all the math as integer arithmetic.   It's super fast, and can be deployed to all validating nodes, even raspberry pi, with little work.
Miners still need to run proof of work to secure the chain.   Nothing about the proposal is "not bitcoin".  It's POS for soft-fork voting only.   If 95% of stake in a voting period approves a fork... then the fork happens.
This is infinitely better than miner voting, because miners are not necessarily stakeholders and their incentives are only aligned for double-spend protection... nothing more.

The cost of electricity for including more transactions in a block is near zero, so this is not a concern.   It is only bandwidth that is a concern right now.
We aren't worried because mining pools are saavy.   ViaBTC for example, is just an extension of AntPool... with a different name.
The lightning network reproduces some of the incentives that Dash created, by introducing a new type of network node that gets to collect some portion of fees for routing low-value transactions.
In addition it enables routed micro-payments which can be used to incentivize further services.

In 1998, Eston Hemings was proven to be the child of a male ancestral member of the Jefferson family via DNA evidence.  
That Eston was descended from an “ancestral Jefferson male” is enough evidence for *some* scholars.   But since there are no direct male descendants, it cannot be strictly proven directly it was Thomas Jefferson himself.   
But it *has* been proven that it was *either him or one of his uncles or cousins*.   
The absurdity of Jefferson defenders is this:
*Either* Jefferson was the father, or he was a pimp for an uncle or cousin.

Segwit2x will activate segwit.   So does bip148.   Users should run bip148.  
You could say... miners can run core.  But if they do, segwit won't hit 95pct.   And then there will be a chain split.
So signalling bit4 and bit1 is safer to some extent.  It the best way to guarantee activation.

Yes, it won't be that important if at least 51% of the hashpower are connected via a relay network.   But it could cause some reorgs and network instability.   I would probably wait for 12 confirms around the time of activation.

Based on 2013 survey: "Net worth or “wealth” is defined as the value of financial assets plus real assets (principally housing) owned by households, less their debts. This corresponds to the balance sheet that a household might draw up, listing the items which are owned and their net value if sold. Personal pension fund assets are included in principle, but not entitlements to state pensions. Human capital is excluded altogether, along with assets and debts owned by the state (which cannot easily be assigned to individuals). For convenience, we disregard the relatively small amount of wealth owned by children on their own 
account, and frame our results in terms of the global adult population, which totaled 4.7 billion in 2013."

@_date: 2017-07-21 16:00:02
Scroll to the bottom.   The last 50 blocks all have segwit (rightmost column green).   We're well over 95%.   In fact, if you look at the last 200 blocks the only ones not signalling (batpool, antpool, btc.top) are those who are currently signalling.... so we can fairly safely assume we are very close to 100% overall.
Of course, no way segwit gets to 95% in this period up from 48%... even if 100% signal for the rest of this period, we will only be at 86%.   So Aug 15th should be segwit lock in ... and Aug 30th activation.    
Sep 25th we will start seeing lightning network transactions hit mainnet to buy a beer or a pizza from a couple places that are early adopters.

According to  which i think is fairly accurate when you "enable weighting":
* Segwit: 83%
* Segwit 2x: 47%
* UASF: 7%
So clearly, the only proposal that can claim any kind of majority economic support is "Segwit only".   This soft fork is making p2sh look like smooth sailing.
CAVEAT: People who wish to remain anonymous are not represented in the coin dance poll.   In Bitcoin land, that can be a *massive* number, dwarfing all of the public entities put together.   If there is some reason to believe anonymous users would have significantly different opinions than non-anonymous users, then these numbers could not be a representative sample.  (I think they are however.)
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:53:07
Which is too high a threshold to pass under any scenario.   There are more than 5% miners that are simply unable to access their machines and upgrade them.   Or are bots, or are indifferent.  
Reality is: 80% should have been chosen in the first place... but we didn't know that.   So now miners are stuck running segwit2x or UASF as their /only/ choice.

That's because of SPV.  Had nothing to do with block size either way.   There is no evidence that raising block size causes a significant number of nodes to drop off.   Also, there is little evidence that hobbyist nodes provide significant value.   What we need are incentives to keep nodes online.   There are proposals to do just that... but unfortunately they require a functioning lightning network to operate correctly.   
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:43:13
No, that's spot on, the 300kb fork violated the spirit of the agreement.   BIP103 was going to get us to 2MB non-witness in good time and miners would have been fine with that (gripingly fine).
The only way to properly compromise is to have a solution that all parties disagree with.   It should be too much growth for luke and not enough for Jihan.   Then we can get segwit active now.
Otherwise, we can UASF in July 2018.   If Bitcoin survives that long.

If someone mines a non-bit1 block, and 50% build on it, then we will have a serious and prolonged chain split.     At this point it *needs* to be enforced, with at least 75% hashpower or UASF nodes will be the only way to heal the network.

Miners simply cannot afford to mine against the main chain.   If 4-5 exchanges say they will endorce UASF, it's a done deal.   Even a slight drop in liquidity would kill the operations of most miners whose margins are very thin.
All you need are a handful of exchanges coming out in support of it and it will be a domino effect... everyone will fall into line. And miners who oppose segwit will just mine legacy blocks after it's activated.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:20:14
As long as Jihan continues to mine *valid segwit-signalling* blocks, but *refuses to mine on top of blocks that contain any actual segwit transactions* then even *upgraded nodes* will follow the wrong chain.   And he can keep using ASICBOOST to do so.   And other miners that refuse to follow his lead will watch their block rewards disappear... until segwit is dead.
All regular bitcoin transactions will still work.   But people will watch as their segwit transactions get dropped.   So nobody will use it.
Segwit is activated... yay... who cares because we can't use it. 
The foundation of any real improvement in bitcoin *must* address miner centralization as a top priority.
To that point, segwit signalling has dropped to 22%!   Even though user nodes are at 90% support.   IMO: We need a POW change pull req.
Or we can just use litecoin.

We can make the 2MB fork work like BIP103.... nice and slow.  Compromise first.   Back out later if it looks like 2MB is too much.   This is about getting the best solution.   A UASF is more dangerous than a MASF.   A UASF in a year is too slow to impact the network ... which is experiencing massive growth issues ... resulting in whole use cases (bitpay's whole model), dropping out.

**Visa + Lightning + Bitcoin**
Customer initiates a visa transaction at a merchant.   Visa publishes a lightning transaction.   Transaction hits your wallet and a pop up on your phone "Confirm this transaction"... just like you scanned someone's QR code.
Visa takes basically no risk on these transactions.   They pay minimal fees because they aggregate massive numbers of TX with a handful of channel partners.
The lowered risk more than offsets the mining fees for channel closes.   And there's your 10tx per day.   
Visa becomes this massive hub... and lightning "works" but it is the ultimate hub-and-spoke.... with tons of centralization for these small value transactions.
Bitcoin remains decentralized and unaffected by the drama.  Even with 4MB blocks, miner fees quickly go to $30 as bitcoin goes to $200k per coin, but it's OK because Bitcoin is rarely used for tx (except for large value/wires)... instead credit cards linked to personal wallets via lightning transactions become the norm.
Lightning is rarely used directly by consumers, because of the convenience and consumer protections offered by Visa.   But it is used extensively for the microtransactions allowing high speed relays and nodes to be compensated for high quality network services.

A protocol specification doesn't have to be crappy.   An HTTP server that fails to understand "GET" request will have every bit as difficult a time functioning as a web server as a bitcoin node that fails to understand P2SH.  The "consequences" of refusing someone's valid transaction, or mining an invalid block can be huge, but errors - like in all protocol problems - are both detectable and recoverable.
We *should* move towards "consensus standards" and away from code some day.   And clients *must* move in lock-step with those standards.   There can be 100 competing implementations - and dev teams - but only 1 consensus standard.   
That is a Bitcoin that will scale - not in TPS but in manpower.  
Bitcoin has matured enough that it may be ready for this ... indeed the current scaling deadlocks could be a result of failure to work on a standards document.
It's not like the consensus layer changes that often... by it's very nature.

Because it had high inflation, silly.  Inflation rate is dropping fast and will eventually be zero.   What happens when it approaches zero:   we will require full blocks.   
Do you want that to happen now... when the network is young and we can develop solutions for it?   Or later... when the network is stressed out, has no capacity to change, and has no layer 2 solutions in place to deal with it?

Nothing to do with saving face.   Core's implementation offered no possibility of miners activating segwit.   The refusal to merge in a -bip148 or a -bip91 option (both sound pull reqs) meant that miners are *forced* to run btc1 in order for segwit to activate.

Orphan here or there during an activation period is bad.,   But P2SH rollout had a chain of orphaned blocks too.     I think the concern was overblown, given the 87% hashpower supporting NYA.    It seems unlikely to me that a 13% chain will cause that much of a reorg.   Maybe 2 or 3 blocks lost.    I won't cry for the miners that refuse to upgrade to both bit1 and bit4 and get squeezed.

No, it's about incentives.   We *shouldn't* listen to people who profit from altcoins.  And we should be *circumspect* when listening to people who profit from specific fee levels.
Blockstream, as a company, is *probably* OK, and seems to be producing good advice and code.   But would they support embedded, open-source, LIQUID-like functionality into Bitcoin tomorrow?   Code that enables any group of entities to trivially enter into a federated trust system based on Bitcoin settlement and high speed transfers...
That seems like it might need a new OP_CODE to make it clean.  A modification of drivechain, with op_bribe should be enough.   But then where would LIQUID be?   A private version of what any group of &gt;M entities could enable on their own.   
How can we trust Blockstream employees to enable technologies that make their software obsolete?
We cannot.

- Mining code is fine.   But there is a configuration limit that is in place.   That limit should remain, IMO.   Nothing wrong with a small default.  It's OK if one block takes 20 minutes instead of 10.
- Closed review was crap... but there is a theory that the existing core group may be compromised in some way.   Maybe this theory is false, but that appears to be what the btc1 group is working with.
- \&gt; 1MB block is fine.   Version bit would be worse for a lot of reasons.  No need to panic there.
- 80% of miners and 80% of exchanges is as much "network consensus" as anyone can expect these days.   
- Miners do not have more than 95% support for segwit ... in any form.   80% is the most they could get.   BIP91 is a great solution to that problem.   
The code is OK.   It's not great.  The network will be strained by 2Mb, but should be fine.   The real issue *has nothing to do with the code*.
This is an issue about control over the repository.   That's it.   That's all it ever was about.
We can argue that point on its merits.

Sure, at home.   Great place to host your full-node.   Probably will have your ISP block listen if you try.   Hosting bitcoin at home just isn't real anymore... and isn't the economic node the system needs.
We need *buyers* (merchants, exchanges) to host full nodes.   that means online diamond merchants with prestashop choosing to run a full node on their machine because it guarantees strong validation and clearance.
Right now it takes several *days* to get a new node up and running.   At 2mb, it will be 6 days after a year or so.   At 8mb, it will be a month.
Nobody will even bother installing a full node if it chews up all their CPU and hdd and a lot of bandwidth for a month just to set up.    Segwit is big enough for now until we fix the problem of *incentivising nodes*.  
The best proposal for incentives involves the lightning network... having merchants and wallets pay nodes a few satoshis per relay or per block.
That, at least, would be sustainable.

I think you have no idea how bad a broadcast P2P network is at scaling.
It costs about $10/month now to host a node in the U.S. for a consumer.   Thats mostly bandwidth costs, because you're talking about 0.5 mbit/sec in bandwidth spikes needed to be a validating, listening node.  
So multiply that by about 1000.   (It's actually worse than that because there are some n-squared bandwidth issues that we can get into... but let's assume it's linear).
That's 500Mbit connection.   OR 10 FIOS connections multiplexed with hardware.   Of course Verizon wouldn't let you run that, but whatever, let's assume they will.   Very generously, we're talking $1000/month.
At that rate, only exchanges and miners will run nodes.   Not merchants, not anyone else.
And bitcoin will be complete shit.
The idea of scaling Bitcoin this way is so preposterous that it is not even worth my time to type this.

Dropping history is precisely why core devs are afraid of growing the chain too quickly.   
Imagine how brittle and prone to state censorship bitcoin will be if most nodes drop history.     In fact, 75% of the posts on bitcoin-dev in recent weeks address this problem.   Censorship and DDOS resistance is becoming more and more critical.   And if a solution is found.... (sharding history, merkle tree histories, utxo commitments, etc.), then core devs would not be nearly as afraid of non-witness scaling.
Big blockers just don't think about the real issues.   All they care about is reducing fee pressure to onboard more users of zero-confirmation point of sale.   Which is *crazy*.   Because none of that use case even matters at all.
Japanese are *not* buying bitcoin to spend it on coffee.   They are *investing* in Bitcoin to hedge against currency fluctuation.   And who does that piss off:   the state.

"ETH classic" seems to me to have the immutability and decentralization Bitcoin fans seems to like.   It is both decentralized in terms of development (core-style loose governance with open participation pull reqs), and mining (hash is asic resistant), and is not inflationary (strict cap on coins).   The nodes are more decentralized because contract scripts don't work without running a full node.   It may have scaling issues some day... but that's *years* away for ETH classic.

This *adds* to miner profits because there is simply no way Bitcoin can capitalize on those fees without lightning networks or side chains.

You must think CEO's of big companies are paid too much right?   Hint: they aren't ... they have to be paid a lot or else their incentive to steal is greater than their salary.   
And that's why Bitcoin works.   Because miners are paid well enough not to attack the network for a short-term gain.
One simple attack is a fee attack: where miners collude to squeeze users for fees.   We may have already observed this.
Another attack is a double-spend.   A 51% collusion of miners transfers money, exchanges it, rolls back the blockchain, and transfers it again.   
This will *destroy* the value of the entire chain.   But if miners only have $100 mil in equipment, and the network has $100bil in daily liquidity - then it's feasable for miners to quickly extract 10 times their investment in the space of a few hours.   And at that volume level... it could get "lost" in the shuffle.
Bitcoin is over.   Miners get to take home 10x profit.
Miners *need* to be compensated at a very high level... so yeah, fees should account for about 0.25% of the value transfer or thereabouts.   That's an OK level for security.   Continuing to attack that ratio is done at the networks peril.

Do you think the Bitcoin network is strong right now?  Many nodes can't keep up with the current block height.  One manufacturer makes 71pct of the Asics.  Hundreds of online services are running 4 yo code or older.
Bitcoin needs a lot of work.  A rushed block size increase... while probably ok in the long run...  would certainly be damaging.
Spoonet+bip103 is probably ok.   Code it up and a lot if devs would help u get it merged.

ViaBTC said they would add some hashpower to the BitcoinABC chain.  Honestly I think BitcoinABC is more viable than the hard fork portion of segwit2x.   At least there will be a coin (which we will all own), that embodies the ideals of BU/EC.... and it will be cheap fees, unlimited transactions and who knows.... maybe you will be happy you own some one day.   Like if you need buy coffee in China.  Even if it's worth 1/100th of Bitcoin ... it will still be worth something.   I'm good with that.

There is a crisis.  Miners are preventing scaling to defend centralizing protocol bugs.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:22:30
Blacklists for spam transactions are OK.   This is not a censorship issue.   Indeed, a DNSBL built-in to bitcoin that censors by address... is *still* not a censorship issue.... because the censorship is *internal*.   IE: I as a user or miner can choose whatever the hell I want to route or blacklist.  Indeed: output blacklists exist, and people run them today, and that's fine.   You can still get an output blacklisted address through the system ... it's just 2-3 times slower.    I've never heard of an input blacklist (from core devs or others).
External censorship is a far bigger problem.   
For example, being compatible with TOR is a paramount feature, and bandwidth rates on Tor can be 20% of what you get on an open connection.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:09:28
Block rewards cannot remain "the same" while bitcoin doubles over and over... that would mean that the hashpower securing the network is getting exponentially weaker compared to the security the network requires.
Fee growth is critical to bitcoin's long term health.    Only a healthy layer-2 will allow a large fee growth and allow miners to profit from large numbers of transactions.

PoS doesn't change the full node investment.   The primary cost of allowing small transactions is that each transaction has to be sent to every node on the network, and permanently recorded in the chain.   That's expensive.   Doing a $2 bitcoin transaction currently results in 30,000 machines getting a copy of that transaction and recording it in a permanent ledger.

Layer 2 solutions do not "take fees away from miners".   Layer 2 allows bitcoin transactions to be confirmed within seconds -which they cannot now, and they allow point-of-sale fees to be collected by layer 2, and deposited with miners at settlement.   They raise the overall fee level.   But users don't care.
If Bitcoin costs $10 to transfer, but only .01 on Layer 2, the result of that is high fees for miners forever.   This is a "settlement network model" of Bitcoin... where the main layer is expensive, stable, and scales with technological growth.
No core dev thinks Bitcoin will never need to fork for larger blocks.   But most agree that a fork should look something like BIP103 - and should include a lot of other needed features.
Layer 2 (and layer 3 ... yes there are plans for this) allows a level of adoption that Bitcoin directly *can never handle* and *never will*.   
Inflation will be "effectively zero" (&lt;0.5%) in only 7 years.   Any number below 0.25% is not sufficient to secure the network without some extra fees, so this is a pretty big concern.   We have to have our layer 2 shit together by then or Bitcoin is fucked.
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:49:18
I definitely didn't say it was "high quality" or "well tested".   I said it was a successful test - code working as expected.   and it was.   This is a hard fork... it's supposed to fork, and it did.  No need to hope .... any miner can just send a lot of TX to themselves for zero fee.    And it only takes 1 to do it.  On mainnet, that 24 hours will be more like 24 minutes - even if the hashrate is low.
All your other points - I agree with.

Hillard initially proposed it to core, and a pull req was made, and I argued core should merge it... at least as an option.
Core devs seem to ignore a lot of good ideas when they are miner, not user, focused.
I think their primary objection was that it's *only* needed for miner coordination, and users don't need it... so they don't need to merge it in.   
Then, days later, he proposed it to the segwit2x repo, where again it was argued, rejected by many... but eventually merged by garzik anyway.   
I suspect BitcoinABC came out of this directly... because *lots* of devs who are deeply distrustful of core were pissed off about that merge.
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:46:42
Miners are *already* preventing a 2x block size increase now.
What makes you think that giving them more power over the blocks size would be helpful?
What makes you think it can be "implemented today" ?    It will take at least 1 year to get a hard fork safely in production.
And if users want a block size increase to lower fees.... what's to stop 26% of miners from preventing it?
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:40:44

BIP91 locks in, 3 days layer, miners start signalling segwit and orphaning.   That's the 23rd.   BIP91 nodes won't relay non-SW either.
Suppose the next 7 days aren't going well. 
  Some miners mine on top of orphaned blocks because of relay issues, other miners dont actually signal bit1, but others do.   Segwit looks stalled, Bitcoin price is falling.
7 days later UASF nodes rescue an ailing blockchain with smooth enforcement of the rules, pushing segwit toward activation, and ending the debate.   Also ending the idea that miners should dictate code changes... ever again.
Some miners dont want this to happen... even more than they don't want segwit.   They want the precedent set that miners can drive code.   
So because of UASF... either a) this won't happen or b) this will be fine.

Yes.  
90pct of segwit is not part of the core process.  It's a bunch of code snippets called "tests" that check to see if segwit is working correctly, and only run during building/compiling the app into something people can use... and sometimes during deployments (checking to see if it works on different types of machines)
Bitcoin has a lot of tests.  Probably not enough though.   Generally, newer code is very well tested compared to older - because standards have improved

Again, it's not consensus breaking.   All existing nodes would follow a 51% chain of 1MB blocks following the old protocol.   No UASF can stop that.   Only a UA*HF* can prevent miner centralization from preventing *soft* forks.

it's 1.7:1 when you talk about scaling, and 4:1 when you talk about block size pressure on nodes.   the real number is 1mb+3mb ... and if you scale the 1mb to 2mb, you don't technically need to scale the 3mb to 6.   you can leave it alone... allowing more on-chain trivial tx but not more on-chain multisig.    the 3mb non-witness was excessive.   should have been 2mb, imo.

Drivechains can allow massive blocks to be essentially "synced" to the main chain via merge mining.   And core seems to be moving more quickly on that than I thought.   I think drivechains are weaker than the main chain , and only OK for moving a few bitcoins around, not thousands.   But ultimately Bitcoin cannot survive if it continues to secure pennies with the same industrial strength as millions.   
I suspect drivechains will be up and running sooner than people think.

The idea of a "base block" is a backward notion typically promoted by people who do not understand how Bitcoin works.   What you meant, maybe, was "legacy block"?   Or maybe "non-witness portion of the block"?

We will see successful lightning *routed* payments very shortly after segwit activates, within a month or 2.   Bitfury has a version that works *without* segwit - but better with (fewer open/close) that it plans on using for mining contract payments.   
I have no doubt that we will be reading about these on reddit less than a month after activation.
Eclair wallet is working now... and sure it will seem like a toy when people install it in the coming months... no channel partners that matter, no merchants that accept payments except a bar in Europe.   
But the routing works.   And all it takes is a handful of merchants and channel operators ... that toy has teeth.

Yes, it will have to be carefully done.   But if he can get 40% of the miners to signal for a piece of shit like B.U. ... then it should be trivial to derail segwit2x at the last minute.... and thereby derail UASF and segwit itself... enabling him to retain his monopoly.
Bitcoin will be worth a lot less though if he plays that game.   I think it might crash hard enough that it will turn out, in the end, to be a loss.   Be nice to convince him of that.

None of the core devs are against a block increase HF at this point.   
Even ones who, in the past, ridiculed it are on-board with the latest roadmap, which includes an HF.   Back just tweeted a reply to me pointing out spoonet as a popular and viable HF solution.   
The issue they have, and I agree with, is that it's a stupid idea to give a "timeline" for one until after segwit is deployed because we don't know what impact segwit will have on fees and adoption and network stability.
That's important stuff, and we should wait a bit, code up a strong consensus fork... and then do it that way.

Jihan is blocking the only scaling proposal with any community support so he can stuff fees in his pocket. If that's not hostile, I don't know what is.
Specifically, he has reneged on an agreement to approve this proposal, provided that non-witness blocks are scaled shortly after. And core devs have shown every intention of approving a BIP103 like proposal to scale up to 2MB non-witness - shortly after segwit is approved.

It's just like the segwit issue where there were no relay nodes.   Had someone on the network been watching they could have deployed a relay node.    Has someone on testnet been watching, they could have raised their limit from 750k.   Not that big of a deal.

@_date: 2017-05-18 13:50:13
It's an attack.   By raising fees, the attacker  - if he is a major miner - can reap more $$$ from fee income.   This more than makes up for the losses he incurs by not mining other fee bearing transactions.   He can use the funds to attack further.   As long as one mining group has at least 33% of the hashpower, they can drive up fees until demand for the token begins to drop.   Then they can back off.... and have control over both the price of the token and the fees.   This can, in turn, be used as a lever to make even more money.
This is a financial attack on the token.

@_date: 2017-07-03 14:55:41
Yep.   You're joking but we do.   Bitcoin needs full blocks or else hashpower will drop and the protocol can be more easily attacked.   Eventually the reward will go to zero... and at that time Bitcoin will need full blocks, and a robust layer 2 ensuring they are always full.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:10:48
The single most important metric of security is liqudity vs hashpower.   And that will continue to get cut in half every halvening... because the price does not affect that ratio.... but the rewards are halved.
Therefore, without full blocks and fee pressure, the Bitcoin network gets more and more vulnerable over time, as rewards decrease.    Bitcoin is in *absolutely* no need to raise block sizes, slash miner profits, and increase centralization pressure.   
It is abundantly clear now that the fee pressure we had was entirely due to an attack designed to put pressure on the system.   And the best thing is:  1MB limit did exactly what it was supposed to do:  it made things very expensive for the attacker.... and they ran out of money.   And Bitcoin functioned perfectly the whole time.
There's no legitimate reason to raise block size... other than control.

Bandwidth grows at 17%-20% per year.   If we double the block size it will take us 4-5 years to catch up.   Another doubling, and you are looking at up to 10 years of network vulnerability and centralization pressure.
I'm not saying for certain that we will be vulnerable during that period.   I am saying, however, that the current plan... doubling via segwit ...seeing how that goes... then increasing if needed via something like BIP103.... is far more sound.

These are all tests:
p2p-segwit.py 
You're correct, 90% is an exaggeration - more like 85% of the code is tests.   It is unequivocally the vast majority of the code.  
They are not all in "the test directory" (none of them are in a directory called test/).   A lot of them are in the "test-framework", and a ton of the lines changes are in the rpc-tests 1) because the framework wasn't flexible enough to handle the new json test scripts needed.  and 2) because the rpc-tests were woefully inadequate to begin with.
Bascially 100% of python code will be test related regardless of where it is.   
I'm very glad you actually looked.   Most of the people on this sub just talk without really looking into what they are talking about.
When it comes down to it... moving witness data from one area to another is simple.    Getting it to be fully compatible and interoperable with the existing rules was a challenge.   
You can see most of the code is trying to deal with sending half-blocks to old nodes and witness-blocks to new nodes, and stuff like that.   Trying to get the old and new nodes to work together was hard.
If *all* transactions had their witness data separate, it would make the code  lot simpler.  I'm a big fan of deprecating legacy transactions in the next hard fork... but because of all the FUD created around segwit a lot of people would panic if I even suggested it.

Since the cost of including a transaction is basically nothing to large and well-connected miners, by definition, they will result in more fees and more marginal profit.   Might be, based on today's rates, say 5% more revenue and 20% more profit?

u/luke-jr : Be fair: there is no credible attempt to lift non-witness cap to 2mb.    A BIP103-like thing would be fine.   And your hardfork code could be used to build it.   If it's linked to segwit activation, that would be trivial to code up and shouldn't offend anyone.   Lots of loudmouths will say "it's not enough".  But most users would be able to handle it - and most miners would accept it too.

Right, but see how you prefaced that statement "according to Exodus".  The idea is that a wallet has to be open source for it to be secure "according to everyone who reads the source".   Presumably enough people read the source that the wallet doesn't contain an exploit or malware, etc.   And you can use gitian to be reasonably sure that the source leads to the app your using.
If you click on each of the icons, there are a bunch of highlighted differences.   
If you want ease-of-use, and still rather strong security, I like Airbitz.   If you want fully transparent build process, and full validation, just use Bitcoin core - each of the links shows you the issues in plain English.

- Dynamic block size makes no sense unless it is decided in a manner orthogonal to miner control.   This can be done via user capability thresholds and "utxo bits".
- Block size and security are definitely linked.
- Bitcoin will probably need a hard fork at some point in the future.   At that time a block size increase via BIP103 will probably be included, because it's the best way to ensure security.   Zero block size growth could compromise security in other ways.

Really, which people?   Not me.   I don't colocate my desktop computer.   But I did colocate my mining rigs.   That meant I could easily run a full node or two... at no cost to me.   But now, if I run at home ... 1) it's economically meaningless 2) it goes offline from time to time if my kid shuts the lid on my laptop.   I have a vps node, but that's not secure at all.   It's just not the same as mining.
Mining centralization is a natural consequence of hardware ASIC mining.  There's INTEL/AMD, NVIDIA/ATI and BITMAIN/BITFURY.  Lets not pretend that people can actually buy and use ASICs.  Manufacturers are the only significant miners, and antbleed proves that from a network security standpoint that's even more important than the number of pools.

If SegWit2x activates, miners can back out of the hard fork any time they want.   Maybe they won't want to.   We'll see.
Core devs already have a roadmap that includes a hard fork roughly within 12-18 months.   The idea is to base the decision on how segwit's increased throughput affects network stability.

Of course we should increase the block size. No core dev disputes this.  BU is just a horrible way to do it.
Segwit is a first step.  Maybe BIP100 or 103 could follow.  They seem to have strong support. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:04:24
That being said, if we can use a lock in for BIP103 (2MB gradual non-witness over 4 years), triggered on version bit 4 and a 75% lock in for UASF triggered on version bit 4.... that would be more than good enough for me.

If blocks were 8 times larger, I cannot imagine how much worse that would be.   24 days to get a node online?   And home network unusable?
2MB is probably OK.   But more than that is wackadoodle.   There are latency issues, validation issues, huge network problems..... even today most nodes can't stay at full height.

You can't mine below the minimum fee level or else the nonparametric stats used to determine fees will ignore them.   No risk = no reward in fee manipulation.   Bitcoin's fee estimates are robust this way.
But I do think that all this stalling and fake-mining a bullshit version (BU) is just a way to keep fees high.   Fees are up to 40% of block reward now.   Miners are making a shit-ton of money over this!

It's a coup because decentralization is the *primary* aspect of Bitcoin that *must* be maintained otherwise there is *no* purpose, or value in Bitcoin.    And what's more, if this fails then *all* POW based cryptocurrencies are *equally* failed.   So let's not pretend Litecoin is some sort of "hedge".    Or ETH - which is already centralized and premined to the point that POS cannot rescue it.
Maybe a form of POS with algorand is OK?   Maybe something else.   But if Bitcoin fails, make no mistake POW as a mechanism for Byzantine generals solution to a global ledger is dead.   And Jihan put the nail in the coffin.

Bitmain can remote shut down your miner if you mine segwit so they have full control over bitcoin.   Segwit will not activate unless bitmain says so.   They make 70% of the hashpower.   40% they control directly.   And if they say so, nothing will stop it.  ASIC mining leads to full centralization and must be stopped.   Better POW now.

Also if luke happens to know people that hold a shit ton of coin that want BIP148 to go down...that wouldn't surprise me... nor would his silence on requests for clarity.

Exactly.   Either it's fraud, and it's usually the merchant's fault.  Or it's a dispute and it's also... usually the merchants fault.   Visa/MC only offer protection in very, very rare cases.  Paypal is better.   If you provide a tracking number... that's all you need, they cover any chargebacks at that point.   Consumers who abuse the chargeback system are banned from paypal.   Which is why for certain industries that are frequently abused by consumers, Paypal is the best choice.
What Visa/MC don't offer is any assurance that a merchant will receive funds when dealing with a new customer or in high-risk goods.   Direct bitcoin trading is "like cash".   For these kinds of merchants, there is no good alternative.  Indeed there is a whole industry catering to "high fraud risk" merchants (like people who sell diamonds), where Visa/MC transactions are insured.   Selling diamonds for Bitcoin, however, is fraud-free.

The spread is so wide, you can buy $1m in the U.S., fly to japan and sell it... pay for your hotel and your ticket.... exchange back to dollars at a bank... and still stuff $50k in your pocket for the effort.

Segwit is 2mb blocks though.   And miners are preventing it.   It's not incompatible with EC.   So I call foul.   Miners are just lying when they say they want EC to raise the block size.

It's just the "relay node" issue during segwit tests.  And the fact that it could be unstuck with a config change was a good test.  I do expect that block to take longer on mainnet too.   It will have less hashpower.

Centralization of mining power and the corresponding fomented distrust of the open source development process.
I've satisfied myself that the process is sufficiently open.   But I would feel a lot more comfortable if the lead maintainers were anonymous, and therefore less suspect to coercion.
If Bitcoin, as a consensus protocol, has been compromised - either by mining centralization or by conflicting incentives in the open source development process - then this is a failure of cryptocurrecny in general.
Some ASIC manufacturers seem busy attempting to oust the core development team as maintainers.   
Some of their complaints are legitimate, because the company, Blockstream, does have too much influence on development and one of their products, LIQUID, depends partly on Bitcoin transfers being either limited, slow or expensive.
However, their solution: a rushed hard fork with little/no testing and backdoor meetings with exchanges ... seems to be nearly as bad as the original problem (if that problem even exists).
What would have been better is to *not* focus on scaling at all.   And instead seek to openly oust the current maintainers on the merits of their argument.   
So investors are *rightfully nervous* about Bitcoin's future - because of the battle for control over the reference source code.

No, I think he is basing that on sync times, chain growth and bandwidth concerns.   I think many of those issues have been mitigated with compact blocks and improvement to the P2p code.  I think block sizes are fine now, and the network is fairly stable.   I know, certainly, that the network would be severely destabilized if blocks grow too quickly.   
Ethereum saw firsthand what happens when their network got taxed.   Whole exchanges had to halt processing to avoid a chain reaction.   Miners had no idea how to deal with this via gas adjustments.   
Bitcoin has never even *come close* to having this problem.   But it would if we went to 4MB today.  I have no doubt the network would be incredibly fucked at that level.   Check out bitnodes and look at the current heights.   You can see about 20% of the network has a hard time keeping up with current bandwidth rates.
The whole idea of p2p cash simply *does not scale*.   It never has, and alot of the assumptions made in the original whitepaper were severely flawed (like SPV, for example, which still doesn't work as envisioned).   Fortunately, bitcoin has a roadmap that shards the network into multiple layers and allows it to bull ahead and scale anyway.   Which is fucking brilliant, IMO.

 - Selfish flag mining: mine a flag.   If you happen to find it very quickly, within 30 seconds, don't transmit it right away... instead start mining the next main chain block for 30 seconds, and then transmit it.   As long as you can complete the entire thing in under 2 minutes, odds are in your favor that you've gained a big competitive advantage on main chain mining - even at some loss in flag mining revenue.
 - The published flag should have a price on it, in addition to the address.   Miners can use the cheapest flag, or their own mined an non-published flag... as they see fit.   No need to fix the price at 25%.

Then they will try to liquidate on the BCC chain for BTC.   During this time, segwit will be going live with news every day on it's approaching success... but there will be no sellers because everyone's coins will be offline or in mobile wallets.
So low supply + high demand will be a big deal, IMO.   Maybe safer to leave it on GDAX and flip on the peak - forget about the 5% i can get playing games with BCC.   I don't think it will be hard to time... guessing Aug 7 or so?

Bitcoin core could incorporate an improved version of VCash's ZeroTime.  It wouldn't require a fork (or really even core)... it's just a trust hierarchy protocol.      It can be layered onto existing nodes, and even could include some incentive fees to reward full nodes for supporting it.

- Because they aren't useful in any way.    Bitcoin's utility is, for the most part, a function of it's market cap.   Why would you send funds overseas using a more volatile, less secure coin that is operated by a handful of people, has no block explorer, and you'll lose a ton of $$ of the conversion compared to BTC?   Sure someone might play games with BCH... but seriously.   The only people who matter are the people that are moving millions to buy land in other countries, store profits from massive greymarket businesses, etc.   The idea that BCH provides any value is absurd at best.   
- It's far less useful than litecoin - which does everything BCH does and better.   This is an unequivocal statement.   There is no possible utility that BCH has that litecoin doesn't.... because litecoin already has faster blocks and more capacity than BCH.... and better dev team, and more merchant support, etc., etc.   IF cheap TX are your thang... litecoin kills BCH.   Litecoin also has a better name, IMO.

Bullshit.   The miners are fucking with the system, and Bitcoin's perception is falling as a result.    Whoever was spamming the system stopped, but they stopped too late.
Bitcoin's scaling roadmap was *fine*... it was destined to succeed beyone everyone's wildest dreams, and miners were going to make massive $$$ as a result.   IF miners really wanted a 2MB non-witness, they could have coded it up, and submitted a BIP and cleaned the code until it was merged.   Core was already close to doing it anyway.  Everyone who cares to look can see that.   Only fuckwits who use reddit as their sole source if information believe otherwise.
Now Bitcoin is being fucked, because a handful of dicks are trying to take control of the source code.   They are behaving like shortsighted fools after a quick buck.

Sure, but you don't move stuff *off* the two way peg until after you accumulate enough to pay the fee.      So if it's $1 to do a tx, you wait until you get $20 in tips before you move it off.   Two-way peg side chains allow small value tx to work very well.   
I think RSK tokens are two way pegs now... and they might actually work well enough to end the scaling debate... if people started supporting them more.   You can just tip in RSK, and be done with it.

SPV doesn't work for point-of-sale, because you need to check the proof of work.  In other words, you need confirmations.   So you can get SPV for slow stuff, or zero-conf with a quick UTXO, fee and sig check ... but you can't have both.
Plus for SPV to be safe(ish), you need to have more distributed mining, otherwise a miner can fake an SPV proof and then be like "no i didn't".   No way to prove he did as well.   
This leaves Bitcoin in the situation where anyone can claim that SPV was faked at any time and cause doubt for the network as a whole.

Did it get deleted?  Here it is again:
Bitcoin was born out of frustration with the Fed bank bailouts and remains true to that purpose. It is a strictly deflationary long term store of value.
However, in order to protect that status, it must remain lean, expensive, and - over time - largely unaffordable. It is, ironically, the Berkshire Hathaway of cryptocurrencies, and will probably stay that way forever.
People can talk all they want about Litecoin and ETH - indeed they love to. But Bitcoin doesn't need to "learn" from these tokens... except to learn that inflation is a bad idea, smart contracts don't belong in your money supply, and segwit actually works.
DOGE, on the other hand offers a unique value statement: it is not intended to be a store of value. It has runaway inflation, a limitless money supply, and a surprisingly strong and active user base.
What DOGE is great at is : cheap fast transactions. By the very definition of DOGE transactions will always be cheap. With its 1 minute block time and minimum viable fee of .000002 cents .... DOGE is the perfect solution to the "cheap transaction" problem. It kills ETH, BTC or any other token for cheap transactions.
Nobody will ever use DOGE as a store of value, so you don't have to worry about holding it. Just buy and sell coffee all day long.
And when you have an extra $2 to pay for fees.... deposit to your deflationary, uncensorable BTC wallet for wealth preservation.
Until segwit happens and lightning works... DOGE seems like the best currency for cheap transactions. The next time someone bitches about fees in bitcoin: tell them to use DOGE until Bitcoin gets a working layer 2 system. Indeed DOGE can be bitcoin's layer 2.
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:02:19
It would end the scaling debate.   One would win.   And the price would shoot way the fuck up on "thank god that's over" news.   And the cool thing is...everyone would figure out that it doesn't "break" bitcoin if it splits.   If you don't want to have a view...just hold both and wait for the storm to blow over.   "Value preserved".
Imagine how strong Bitcoin would seem if it manages to split and honey badger *still* don't care.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:03:13
It's not undefined.   The code and mailing list are public.  People need to back down.   The only thing anyone really complains about is the 2 month timeline... which is crazy, I agree.   But if that's changed to a reasonable timeline, then there's really nothing wrong with it.   It was something core was going to release anyway - and just got nudged along by people who are panicking because of high fee fud.

Yeah, segwti2x is basically just a "miner-activated BIP148" now.   it kicks the impending chain split down the road until january.   if core doesn't merge btc1, i'm guessing miners will start to back out if it.   and then we will have a chain split anyway.   But man, BTC will *pump* in Aug if this happens.

Really? I've never paid the same price.   Bitcoin is more in demand than you think.   It's like paying in cash... you can always negotiate a better price with bitcoin.

How else could segwit get in production .  Bip91 , bip148 and segwit2x are not part of core.   Bitmain has no choice but to run non core code in order to activate segwit.

And when a feature threatens miner revenues... they will not like it.   Which is why *any* block size increase will be contentious among miners.   Which is why segwit is a great way to delay.   If segwit is active tomorrow, then we can work on a hard fork, right?   Miners will find a way to disagree with that too.

You don't seem to understand that nobody is *using* ETH because of the features.   They are buying it because of the *existence* of features they *don't understand*.   That is pretty much the definition of a house of cards.
Every single one of those ICO's could have used the mastercoin protocol or T-Zero.   And they would have saved money and given a much smoother user experience.   
But they didn't because Ethereum makes your ICO look "cool".

He made some massive, and deal-breaking assumptions. The biggest is that the topology will be random. This is an absurd topology which has never emerged in any social network of this kind.   The second is that LN is the only scaling proposal.
1.    A hub/spoke network with about 5000 hubs is both a) more decentralized than bitcoin is today and b) only a handful of hops per user on the network, assuming those hubs randomly connect to 10-20 other hubs each.
2.    There are other off-chain scaling proposals, like MimbleWimble that also add critical privacy layers. Bitcoin doesn’t just need to scale… it needs to *get better*. That means improving privacy as well.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:07:07
Segwit moves signatures outside of the main block.   
This roughly doubles the number of transactions Bitcoin can handle.   
This also makes it cheaper and easier for people to build bitcoin wallets, hardware wallets.   
It also makes it possible for people to trade bitcoins more privately, without even an internet connection, by exchanging "off chain transactions" that happen "on the side".   
This will create new markets and use cases for Bitcoin.

Airbitz gives you a pretty good security with a pin/password/device combo + paper backup.   So if you lose your device, you can recover without the paper... just the password.   And if you lose the password, you can use the paper.   
Circle is even easier... works like a bank, they hold/insure your coin... you trust them with your assets.   For people who don't trust themselves, it's the perfect choice.

@_date: 2017-06-19 13:08:03
It's an old proposal to allow someone to specify a bunch of inputs, and a special script sig that allows you to sweep them into a single UTXO with far fewer bytes in the transaction.   Segwit basically makes this obsolete, since the bytes for the sig are already moved off the expensive part of the block.

Pruning nodes are 100% secure, but they do not contribute to the health of the network.
So if you have 10,000 pruning nodes and 500 full nodes, your network can be attacked by taking those 500 full nodes offline.
It is also trivial to find out which nodes are full and which are pruning.

Fortunately, you don't have to choose.  Segwit is bigger blocks, and BU isn't.   BU is the "potential" for bigger blocks if we can trust miners to "coordinate offline" and raise blocksizes "responsibly".

If ETH "beats" BTC in any meaningful way, and causes BTC to fail...then what's to prevent that from happening to ETH via another alt?

Right now, anyone can simply buy a bunch of stuff... claim it was crap or not shipped or they got toilet paper instead of diamonds, and Visa will always honor the customer.   So merchants are at a disadvantage.   With vendors, it's the opposite.   The vendor gets screwed if merchant is dishonest.    Bitcoin operates like a cash transaction.   When I buy with Bitcoin from China, I pay 40% up front, and 60% on inspection at the docks.   That usually works out.

I agree, Monero is acceptable.    I think Monero is the only "credible threat" to Bitcoin's dominance in its primary use area as an uncensorable, immutable ledger.
But they have had a lot of issues with the community support for things like mobile wallets, etc.    And MimbleWimble might be out relatively soon in Bitcoinland... in which case Monero has no use case left.
ZCash simply doesn't scale by any stretch of the imagination.   Transactions are massive, slow to validate and even less likely to work on mobile.   I can't see it being used seriously.

No big investment would value eth so highly for the long term because it offers no advantage.   
You can ICO with a colored coin just as easily as with an ETH token.   The key difference is that ETH makes your Ponzi scheme look legit and high tech.   And the eth foundation will even endorse it.   
Raising money with no intention to develop anything is an old and solid business model.

The idea of *investing* in something like ETH is absurd.   you should use it for what it's good for ... like a fresh ponzi scheme, and then convert to something stable, like bitcoin... or Amazon stock.

I own ETH too, and I mine it.   I do think it's overvalued and I think people are buying into it for the wrong reasons.   Gas prices are crazy now, and the value as a contract platform seems to be slipping.   It takes a week to install the ETH software now, and that time will be double next year.   But who cares?  Does anyone actually care if the thing even works.
This reminds me of XRP.   XRP also doesn't really work, but people keep buying into it anyway.
I don't think there's *any* end to the number of people who will want to buy into something this way, however.   And the ICO use case is tremendous.   Each ICO props up ETH further.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:29:17

His wife can't bitch at him because her YouTube videos are slow.   Nobody gives a shit about Uganda or Congo.   If you've ever been there (I was in DR), you'd know that.
2. Joe merchant needs to run a node, online, as a part of their web hosting contract.... without a very significant increase in cost.... or he will prune it.
At 5TB in 10 years it might be OK.   At 1TB, it's definitely OK.  At 50TB, forget it.   Bitcoin is dead.   That's the direction ethereum is going... go ahead and jump on that bandwagon.   
I think your perspective as a hosting provider might be skewed.  I too have run large data centers.  I turned up- 1PB of RAID storage for only $200k fairly recently.   But that's not the point.   Never has been.

Well, suppose i want to get started using bitcoin.  I can install a client and then download the block chain... but only for "real" full nodes.   So the network becomes brittle if these nodes drop off.   
It's important to download the whole chain, since it cannot be forged.   If I just asked "hey what are the balances for all these wallets".... some peer on the network could like to me (or worse... someone could intercept my request, pretend to be lots of peers and they can all lie to me).
With Ethereum the entire state of the system can be downloaded from a peer, rather than the chain... this is orders of magnitude of times smaller than the chain.    And you can "somewhat verify" that this is real, by seeing that there was a commitment mined into the blockchain agreeing that it was real, and seeing that stuff was built on top of that commitment.   
But ultimately this means a collusion of miners in ether land can invent an old state, and as long as they all agree to mine on top of it... they can trick fast sync nodes into believing accounts have balances that they do not.   Ether created out of the ether.
Only ethereum full nodes...that sync from scratch and maintain a full state... are securing the integrity of the chain.   Who runs those?   Who knows.
In Bitcoinland, this is impossible.   Any fully validating node needs to know own the genesis block.... a widely published hash.   
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:46:22
If it's compatible with BIP148 (and looks like it will be), then it will activate.   If it's compatible with the COOP proposal... then it will have wings.

@_date: 2017-06-15 15:38:03
Yes, there are 2 activation attempts, and if it succeeds either one, all UASF nodes will remain on the main "segwit2x" chain.   
Then the network will have a few months to decide whether or not to support the hard fork to 2mb base size (transaction sizes are still capped at 1MB, to avoid quadradic hashing attacks).
And if bitcoin's main reference code doesn't include that hard fork, we will see core at odds with 80% of the hashing power.   Which is *even more scary* than a user-driven UASF split chain.
I do think if 80% hashpower supports segwit2x it will be less risky to merge it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:04:19
With larger blocks it cannot be.   And we may have 4MB blocks within a few years if the COOP proposal is followed.   BIP91 + COOP!

You could open an LN with an exchange, and buy BTC.   Then you can spend it on the LN... never closing the channel.   You can continue to buy and spend all day long... never closing the channel.   You can receive funds, and build up the channel.... never closing the channel.
After weeks go by, and you've bout a bunch of bitcoin, and spent a bunch on stuff, and sold that stuff, and done a lot of business, you can say... hey I'm sitting on 0.5 BTC profit...let's move some of those funds on chain.   So you pay 0.01 BTC and do so.   
It doesn't matter what bitcoin's price is... that workflow will always be OK.

Do I have to independently verify transactions from a year ago?   How likely is it that someone has mined 1 year's worth of block chain difficulty in order to fool me?   Remember, the POW is not gameable.  I can calculate difficulty requirements without needing transaction info.   So I can POW verify 90% of the blocks.  I only need sigs for the last month or so to have a trusted UTXO.

there is absolutely a valid reason to do this.   segwit will not activate without 95% signal which may be impossible.   as a miner, you can either run UASF, or core... and neither provide a coordinated activation threshold.   segwit2x does.   BIP91 is simply the best way to activate segwit.

No, it's necessary in the long term.   I think we should raise the block size, because I think the network can handle 4mb blocks and we should raise it as high as the network can handle while bitcoin is still young .... but in the long term there will either be high fees, or bitcoin will be dead.

Yes, it could mean that blocks are 10 times slower and fees 10 time higher (I would expect them to be very high, like $100... because of people wanting to sell and buy between chains) for 5 months.   
Under that pressure, it may be possible that the value of the chain drops significantly... reducing hashpower further and increasing the time further - to the point where it is no longer recoverable in any significant or meaningful timeframe without a POW change.
The surviving chain will likely be called Bitcoin by the economic majority... and lets hope at least some of the competent developers follow it.

Most of the ethereum nodes are pruning "fast sync" nodes.   Ethernodes doesn't track them separately.    It also doesn't keep track of what block heights/machine states are available at each node, etc.   
This shows heights:
You can see many nodes are not caught up to the current height.   Bitcoin is already struggling to keep up.
Ethereum is having an even harder time scaling, and that's why Bitfinex had to suspend transactions yesterday.
No introspection in individual nodes... is this pruning?  No idea:
Bitnodes even gives you the health of each individual nodes:
Now look at the flag "NODE_NETWORK".   This is critical, since it means the node is a real full node.   How many NODE_NETWORK nodes are there?
More than 6000.   I was surprised by this...and heartened that most of that 7000 number isn't fake.   Most pruning nodes in bitcoin land don't listen.   
In ethereum worlds, this is different.   DAPPS need RPC connections, so people tend to run listening nodes.   But fast-sync listening nodes are useless for certain kinds of network health metrics.  Nobody to my knowledge has spent time looking into this.,

Cheapness is not a feature that matters because every alt coin under the sun has this "feature".   ETH is depreciating every day because of inflation, you just don't see it because it's being pumped right now.   
BTC was a reaction to the Fed.   It's success has been as a store of value/digital asset.   If fees are too low, then miners don't get paid and security is weakened.   You can get away with it when there's high inflation.   BTC is transitioning to low inflation.
BTC is not used for "gas" in any way, because contracts - if any - are executed off chain, either in a centralized manner, or via side chains.

If there is a chain split, and if it has at least 15% hashpower, they will have already won.   The main chain will be forced to hard fork to prevent a reorg.   Which means the split chain will be technically and in every sense of the work "bitcoin".   "Hard fork chain" will die a death of 1000 cuts.
Soft forks have the incredible advantage of sweeping up indifferent users.

Transaction cheapness is not a "feature".   You are paying for your cheap transactions with a 14% inflation rate.
Any token can be used for an ICO.   Even Bitcoin.    OR roll your own token... why not - it's cheaper easer and faster than ETH to do so.    
ICO's are using ETH because the ETH foundation *encourage and endorse* ICO's.  Full stop.
ETH has some interesting tech.   But it should not be using the same token for value transfer as the token used for gas prices and contract execution.   The conflation of these two is a problem, not a feature of ETH.

You're missing the point.  There is nothing immutable about a block chain since someone can just make a new chain, from scratch with a new history that looks authentic.   The only thing preventing this is proof of work (POW) or, in the case of private chains, proof of authorization.   If you have POA, you may as well use any other PBFT system.   You can define what the rules are (immutable, etc.), and using PBFT, prove those rules are followed by the majority.

Everyone will keep a lightning channel open with a couple providers, and the channel fees ($20-$40 / year) will be more than made up for by the incredible utility.

Verification of work is the foundation of value, and this "game theoretic value" is the basis of bitcoin's security.   While I agree that SPV clients cannot verify "the whole chain" and all inputs, they do retain enough information to validate that the blocks received would have been been expensive to forge.   Indeed, you can calculate how much money a node owner would have had to spend to deceive you.   For 90% of the users of bitcoin, this is sufficient.   It would be far, far too expensive for a node to deceive an SPV client holding, say, $10k worth of coin, and doing a 10-depth verification.
So there is no incentive to run a full node for less funded users.
Bitcoin itself becomes vulnerable, however, if "nobody" is validating.   So while we *need* full nodes, only users with hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions worth are truly *incentivized* as you say, to maintain their funds in a full node.

1. Dedicated storage is still very expensive.  
I'm not spending $89/month to host any of my merchant sites.   Most of them are $10/month.     If I had to spend 9 times more just to stick a full node on there, I just will run a pruned node instead and save $80 month.   And not contribute to the health and resilience of the network...  which is what we need to avoid.
2. Bandwidth is an even bigger limiter, not storage.   If i run a listening node now at home today, it eats 500k bandwidth.   Which is OK.   But 2MB... that would be a killer for a lot of people.   
This has to be done gradually and cautiously, whicle watching the health of the network to be sure we don't have outages or gabs in geographic distribution or coverage.

A problem with wildcard inputs is it could lead to a big loss of privacy - and therefore fungibility.   Which is probably why it won't get much love.

Most of those things apply to POW mining.   Staking has to have an artificial "timer" added to blocks.  There is no notion of "difficulty" that can be adjusted... staking entities are chosen "randomly", but this must be deterministic.   
PoS is *great* for a second layer protocol... with checkpoints to the primary POW layer.   RSK should be POS and Drivechain should be POS.

Nope.  Any colored coin or even "roll your own" clone of bitcoin will work just fine.   This is how all the original ICOs worked.   The reaosn people use EHT is because the ETH foundation will stick their face on your ICO and legitimize it.

1. The "core" mailing lists and forums are not a good place to work on code.   Asking for feedback is OK.   But ultimately, you need to have a working pull req with some functional tests to be taken seriously.   I'm sure garzik will go that route at the appropriate time.
2. To my eye, this code makes Segwit2x compatible with an Aug1 activation of segwit in general:    ... merged with feedback and commits from JHillard and Shaolin Fry.  Segwit 2x is, more and more, becoming a reasonable compromise.    
3. I think the comments on github get dropped when the underlying commits that stuff is based on go away.   There was some unusual handling of commits and pull requests that caused the comment drops... but ultimately, I think the spirit is one that is fairly open to criticism and correction.   Dealing with branches and merges can be a hassle, and I would forgive these offenses.
4. It is precisely because these concerns were addressed and the code is compatible with comments and feedback that Jihan won't back it.  
5. Jihan is opposed in general to the activation of segwit in any form - and has shown willingness to back out of any agreement for any reason.  I agree, there is no point.   The code is now largely "core compatible" ... which means it's largely "Jihan incompatible".
6. The only solution, in my mind, to advancing the network, protecting us from further loss of decentralization and addressing the recent related CVE is to release BIP149 code on Aug 2nd or as soon as possible after that.

I think they have too many bottleneck in their cloud infrastructure.   That's why I like to use "master-less" and specialized data stores that use hashing to pick a node where things execute, like Cassandra and Gluster.   
Theoretically they should be able to spin up new AWS instances to handle the load.   Also they should be using DNS or BGP to split the load instead of "balancers" which typically result in more bottlenecks.   DNS is nice because, as much as possible, you want the client to route to the most available server.   If the server is routing, well... logically you've just moved your bottleneck elsewhere.
AWS also makes it as hard as possible (big complicated api, java, etc.) to pick a data center, get a new node online.   And I've seen situations where the tooling around AWS is the thing that most often breaks.   If I can avoid AWS and use something like Digital Ocean, I do.   Or better, use multiple providers .... forcing your code to be agnostic, and thereby robust to vendor issues.
I also avoid things like Hadoop which are trying to be everything for all people, and usually result in bloatware that doesn't scale for some obtuse reason.

100% agree here.   I think it's "too soon" to go with unlimited blocks, and expect bitcoin to keep functioning.   However, I also think 2MB is "probably OK".   My only engineering objection to the 2MB is that it is too quick for everyone to upgrade in time.   My other objection is that it was arrived at in a coercive manner that is in opposition to decentralization.    But that's a slippery-slope argument, which is almost always a logical fallacy so I'm not terribly concerned with it.

segwit2mb is a joke:

Glorified colored coins ICO's are the  real-world use case for Ethereum right now.   The ridiculous U.N. money distribution was a stunt at best.   Smart metering also a stunt.
The problem is that "smart contracts" don't engender trust once they interface with the real world.
The only solution to this is the oracle model.   But show me an ICO that actually uses the oracle model to allow the token holders to access funds.   
The only one I can think of is the DAO.   Which I loved.   I invested in it... and then when I saw how shitty the forums were I sold out.   And then it collapsed and I was very very lucky I sold when I did.
The only thing I would be interested in investing is another DAO... and this one would be "oracle-ized" on every metric: spending funds, voting, draining funds from users who fail to participate, allowing vote delegation.
Fix the problems and try again, I say.   This spew of random ICO's is ridiculous.

Segwit's discount is a fix for a current bug in Bitcoin's incentives that makes inputs more expensive than outputs.   This is important for Bitcoin in the long term.   Consider UTXO growth, etc.   Outputs *shouldn't* be super cheap... or you wind up with a massive UTXO.   
If anything we should *only* charge for output bytes.   Literally making inputs free or super cheap.   That would reflect the actual costs more accurately in may ways.   Segwit didn't go far enough.... only balancing by byte, instead of incentives for shrinkage.

Storage isn't really an issue with Bitcoin.   It's bandwidth that's the issue.   People who talk about the size of a blockchain and blocks as a problem are referring to the bandwidth needed to run a listening node, and the bandwidth needed to transmit every transaction in the world to every node in the world. 
That being said, there have been big advances in global average bandwidth.   When BIP103 was written in 2015 it was 17% per year.  Now it's more like 22%.   4MB blocks (segwit2x) are probably OK, and people need to understand that "immutability" never referred to the protocol.   The ledger will remain immutable during any hard fork that even approaches a consensus level of support.

Yay, real analsys.   ETH has this problem times 10.  Nobody runs a full node anymore.   Bitcoin really, really needs full nodes.   UTXO commitments can fix this, IMO.   But they aren't ready yet.    
Segwit is awesome because you get 2x throughput and no increase in full node size... because you can safely throw away witness data and still be a "fullish node".   
The problem with "witness pruned nodes" is that you can only verify POW - but not sigs.  So now you have a situation where "witness pruned nodes" can only be used for the initial sync of other "witness pruned nodes"
Which is OK... but leads to the loss of true full nodes.
So we do need to keep the total block size small, or the network could severely degrade.

218 bytes is without the signature information, correct?  ethereum is already segregated witness, so you don't see this on the blockchain, but it eats bandwidth.   it's just like bitcoin in that respect, sigs are probably 4 times bigger than the inputs, sometimes more.

COOP is 2MB capacity without, 4MB max block (2.1 avg) with segwit.  
If Silbert wanted 2MB non-seg and *8MB* max segwit blocks, he could have specified.   I think that's not what they wanted - but maybe it is?   Hard to tell.
If it is (8MB max blocks), the only way devs will accept that is with a 17-20% per year block weight growth (4mb ... 8mb over 4 years)
That was also discussed on the mailing list with some level of agreement.

bitcoin already has a mining centralization problem right now, and it's a pretty big deal... probably the worst thing about bitcoin is the mining centralization issue. and paying money and spending 3 months to download and verify a petabyte blockchain from a sparse network of, say, 8 mining pools and 6 exchanges that have a copy sounds a bit crazy to anyone. bitcoin's price and profitability doesn't have to go up much for this to happen... this is a natural consequence of popularity and cheap fees.   
these massive block chains simply will not be stored outside of the biggest members of the network... so how can anyone know whether a transaction is real?   answer:  they ask these data centers.   if you ask two small questions (show me only the block headers of every block since inception, show be the all the blocks with outputs to the following address), you can be reasonably sure that a given transaction is honest.   the first question lets you verify the POW of the chain.   the second question lets you verify that an address is part of that POW chain.   
theoretically, someone could lie to you though.   they could lie on both questions.   so you have to ask lots of different data centers these questions.   but then you have a "sybil problem".   someone can trick a new SPV wallet during its initial query.... so that it thinks the entire chain is very weak.   this can be solved by hard-coding wallets with height/difficulty curves.   see how this is going?   it's hard, it's weak and it sounds like a nightmare for the security of bitcoin.
early on bitcoin engineers realized that the "petabyte block chain" problem wasn't going to be trivially solved via spv and that that fraud proofs were very hard.  someone figured out we could turn the problem on its head and use bitcoin as a settlement network instead.... leaving the problem of centralization up to operators of that network.   bitcoin could just keep working the way it always has, and all the centralization pressure can be moved "up layer".
because there is no barrier to entry to becoming a settlement partner (anyone with 1 bitcoin can set up a node and hang a shingle out on the internet), there would be far more "lightning nodes" in that future network than "petabyte blockchain storage data centers".
this leads to a similar centralization issues (big nodes with lots of channels run by wallet vendors and exchanges)... but it is a far, far better outcome (because the underlying layer is still decentralized).
unfortunately this breaks a lot of people's expectations of how bitcoin works.

No negative interest can be charged unless you sign transactions that agree to those terms.  Only channel open/close events and agreed-to transaction costs result in fees.   If a channel partner is pissing you off, just open it up with someone else.  I expect most partners...like a marijuana dispensary in California, which is a canonical example that will drive billions through lightning, will not charge anything.   I personally am helping dispensaries set up bitcoin acceptance, and will personally be setting them up to be lightning nodes... simply because it helps with customer retention.

Yes, fees must eventually be high to supplement block reward.   Blocks must remain full or that will not happen.   At around 4MB full blocks, the fees will more than enough to pay for hashpower forever.   I think 2MB may not be enough for the long term.   2MB should be OK for 1-2 years from now... keeping fees down under $2.   But we will need 4MB some day.

Monero is totally fine.   The only issues I've seen are on the development front, especially around light clients.   The only challenge with Monero is that it addresses a problem (fungiblity) in a way that Bitcoin also plans on addressing via MimbleWimble extension blocks.   SO *some day* Moneyo might be irrelevant.   But that day is not here, and may never come... so it might be just fine.
Smart contracts have some killer apps which should not be discounted and continue to drive up the ETH price.   Every time a new ETH based token ICO hits the market, more ETH gets tied up in smart contracts that never unravel, more ETH is acquired to pay gas fees, etc.
OR to put it less politely:  ponzi schemes are ETH's first killer app.    I don't want that to minimize the very real value these schemes drive to ETH investors though.   The global appetite for ponz is neverending.

I'm going to copy and paste some of your reddit arguments from the last month here, just to make it easier for you:
`You're delusional.`
`Fuck off.`
`You underestimate how quickly things can change in the tech field.`
`I'm personally convinced that the complete removal of the blocksize limit would be best for bitcoin
spam transaction usage will eventually even out and keep up pace with technological improvement.`
So of those arguments, I'm going to focus on the last one, which seems a legitimate argument to allow block size to grow naturally.   I don't want to go into how your personal convictions aren't really a sufficient engineering foundation but:
The question is: suppose there were no blocksize limit : What limits would miners set?   What are the incentives to set limits at all, and what limits would be set?   What would it look like if there were different limits per miner and how would this affect centralization?   How would the overall network respond to these new limits in terms of resilience and reliability?
If you know the answers to these questions, you know more than *every other core developer combined.*   Which means we need you *badly*.   
We need someone with expertise in these areas to answer these questions, because we don't have a solid proven answer for.

This also knocks everyone off the network who is "false-signalling" for segwit2x but has no intention of mining &gt; 1mb blocks.
Which can be seen as a good thing, but it is also a big risk.   Bitmain has no idea how many people will join them on the hard fork.
Unless most major exchanges will support the hard fork and call it Bitcoin, nobody will actually mine with Jihan.   And giving people only 2 months to upgrade software might wind up with 50% of the network running &lt;= 1MB + Segwit and 50% running &gt;1MB + Segwit.
Then the market will get to decide.   And I bet it will *not* be a clear winner.   At the end of the day, no matter what... there will be 2 coins.

I'm quite heartened by the fact that jgarzik and jhillard have been working together on the btc1 nya code base.   I think it has a good chance of being the version run by 80% of the hashpower and 80% of the exchanges.   And although I don't agree with everything in the code, it's largely BIP91/BIP148 compatible, and if it flies, we will have segwit by august.
I would seriously considering rebalancing some into BTC.   I won't dispute ETH has a long-term value proposition - if people use it for contracts.   But as a store of value it may be strictly inferior.   To some extent transaction speed an store of value are opposites - because of inflation.   Did you know ETH has a 14% inflation rate in 2017?

Harder to sell MASF...you mean.   Since that's what caused this mess.   Most core devs have agreed *never again* will a soft fork be deployed as a MASF if segwit fails to activate.   It's a big deal.
If there is a chain split, and UASG has at least 15% hashpower, they will have already won.   The main chain will be forced to hard fork to prevent a reorg.   Which means the split chain will be technically and in every sense of the work "bitcoin".   "Hard fork chain" will die a death of 1000 cuts as users and miners just "default over" to the segwit chain.   Price of "1mb forever hard fork chain" will bottom out very quickly.

Bitcoin has *no* value if Jihan controls it.  You may as well buy ETH... another coin controlled by a single actor/consortium/bank.

So yes, be as reckless as you want... because sitting on centralized Jihan coin is worthless.   I will *happily* dump ALL of my Jihan coin today and buy BIP148 coin.

1. The "core" mailing lists and forums are not a good place to work on code.   Asking for feedback is OK.   But ultimately, you need to have a working pull req with some functional tests to be taken seriously.   I'm sure jgarzik will go that route at the appropriate time.
2. To my eye, this code makes Segwit2x compatible with an Aug1 activation of segwit in general:    ... merged with feedback and commits from JHillard and Shaolin Fry.  Segwit 2x is, more and more, becoming a reasonable compromise.    
3. This code is even more compatible, and again shows that the NYA team is actually quite open to feedback and public development.  
4. Some comments on github got dropped when the underlying commits that comments were based on went away.   There was some unusual handling of commits and pull requests that caused the comment drops... but ultimately, I think the spirit is one that is very open to criticism *and* correction.   Dealing with branches and merges can be a hassle, and I would forgive these offenses.   
4. It is precisely because these concerns were addressed and the code is compatible with comments and feedback that Jihan may not back it.  
5. Jihan seems opposed, in general, to the activation of segwit in any form - and has shown willingness to back out of any agreement for any reason.  The code is now completely "core compatible" ... which means it's largely "Jihan incompatible".
6. One solution to advancing the network, and protecting us from further loss of decentralization and addressing the recent related CVE is to release BIP149 code on Aug 2nd or as soon as possible after that.   I'm also a supporter of integrating a BIP148 *option* into core.   Bitcoin core should probably contain a mechanism for user capability statistics collection.

I personally think that a smart contract system is better in a second layer than on the primary chain.   The RSK (rootstock) model, in the long term, is better for sound contracts and mitigates risks.   RSK is coming out of alpha in about 6 months.   Their VM has been completely re-architected for security.  We'll see how ETH reacts.

@_date: 2017-06-02 15:32:20
Yes, it will just fork everyone off the network and start mining a new chain.   It can do this with only 51% of miners, and no scheduled date.   The presumption is that miners would never do this.   (Which they won't).   Thus they can keep the block size 1MB forever and fuck users over for fees.   Yay mining.

Ethreum doesn't scale.   Bitcoin does.   Fees naturally account for increased usage and prevent network collapse, lock ups and problems.   Layer 2 networks *will* be incentivized by these fees.   Eventually.
All we need is a couple more times that the Ethereum VM is unable to cope with the bandwidth generated by massive ICO pump/dumps and people will realize that you cannot mix smart contracts and money on the same chain.

How could they prove they were real keys enough for you to trust payment?   They would need to leave a public key on disk.   Then sign a message with the private.
A smart contract loaded with the private key wouldn't cut it.   Anyone could access the key.
So you *still* have to trust them.
It is not yet possible for a contract to generate (or decrypt) secret data that is secure or hidden from observers of the blockchain.

They are 10 cents and rising.   If ETH hits BTC's market cap and level of usage, txns will be $2.... and the blockchain will take a week to download.   Miner consolidation will make Bitcoin's problems look like nothing.   Byt hey... maybe proof of stake will be secure?   Maybe.

That would be a hard fork, not a soft fork.   You need to look up what those terms mean.
Segwit is *already fully compatible* with the current nodes.   So it's a soft fork.   If current nodes need to make a change to "defeat" segwit... then that's a *hard fork*.
That's *why* UASF is powerful.   It only needs 15% miner support to activate.   And when it activates the main chain will die a lingering death.... as risk increases and reward decreases.
And miners know this.   Once UASF gets 15% ... they will all switch or risk losing everything.

I'm sure u/luke-jr would be fine with barrycoin's BIP91 activation of segwit, even if it happens on Aug 1, and could cause UASF nodes to have to decide whether to revert back to core.   nice thing is that barrycoin looks like it will trigger a MASF on bit 1 ... which means 90% of the nodes out there can just do nothing.

Yeah, which means you are *relying* on unpruned nodes but you aren't *participating* as one.   Crypto node browsers conspicuously do not mention whether they are full nodes or not.... because this is an attack vector.   The larger the full blockchain, the weaker the security is for this vector.

Well, it's silly to assume every miner signalling segwit now would suddenly signal uasf later.    Althoug Bitmain just gave them miners a big incentive to do that.   It seems to me that you're better off signalling UASF now ... so the movement builds momentum... than waiting until the last minute.

....."The mortgage servicer and the credit card banks receive your dollars as planned. But like you, they are having to start transacting more business in cryptocurrency as the world marches toward the brave new world, and so the dollars they are being paid by you to settle your debts with them are becoming less and less powerful in terms of how much cryptocurrency those dollars can buy." ....
So they begin to lend crypto instead.   The way banks always do, they refuse to take risks.   Customers deposit crypto, and they are able to lend out a percentage of that crypto.   Crypto deposits pay a small interest rate, and the bank lends that crypto out to margin speculators, home buyers and investors.
Banks find they are earning a more stable income lending crypto, because the interest rates they have to pay "holders" are quite low, and the value of their percentage return - denominated in crypto - is far more stable, and even growing.   
Bolstered by these profits, crpyto lending grows rapidly, while rates on fiat lending spiral out of control.  No amount of Fed cash printing can keep up with the risk banks take lending out fiat.
Eventually the Fed steps in and acquires a pool of crypto which they use to guarantee bank deposits, and peg the dollar to - lowing the cost of borrowing, and allowing the economy to again be manipulated by the Fed.   
They can sell crypto or buy as needed to stimulate or retract an economy, and keep the dollar as strong or weak as needed.

Really?   So you're telling me that if one of Vitalik's pet ICO projects gets $200 mil accidentally locked up in a broken solidity project, he won't fork it again?   What if a murder "smart contract" gets taken out on someone and the courts demand that Vitalik redact the funds?   Would he?   What if the block reward is no longer sufficient to sustain hashrate growth.... will ETH fork to increase the reward?   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Try to find anyone that runs an ETH full node:
I don't believe for a second ETH is "decentralized".
I do believe that ETH is a very good distributed smart contract platform, and probably OK for small-value payments.... where you are not concerned with a government redacting it.   
I think there are lots of use cases for ETH that have not been explored.   But to compare it to bitcoin is definitely apples and oranges.

Segwit was dead in the water.   there simply was no way for it to activate.   It would never get more than 80%.   Now we have BIP148 and Segwit2x.   
Both of them get Bitcoin going in the right direction.
BIP148 is dangerous, and can cause a chain split.
Miners that want segwit to activate *have no choice* but to run Segwit2x.
I don't think they will follow through and actually hard fork though.   Maybe they will... hard to tell.

I bet it's good for 20 years.   Not 3-4.  Lighting will eventually consume all &lt;$40 payments and roll the fees up.   Blocks do need to be full for Bitcoin to function and there's no way miners will ever vote to raise block size after the next two halvings.

Who cares.   I'm out if we don't get segwit Aug 1.   I'll buy back in if BIP149 code is merged.   Bitcoin needs segwit more than people think.   Covert, patented ASICBOOST is a bug, a big one, and it's as bad as a DAO hack deep down... leading to massive centralization pressure and politicizing of upgrades.
Probably more speculators listen to me when I give a talk at Bbg than half the stupid vlogs out there.   I've been promoting the shit out of Bitcoin because I believe in it.   But if the POW is compromised and the community it too chickenshit to fix it... the experiment is over.

You have to understand more about how soft forks work.
If it have 15% then it will activate, maybe in December.    Who wants to use "1MB cripple-chain"  to transact?   Nobody.   Who wants to send  someone money on a chain that could disappear?    Nobody.   As people lose trust in the main chain there are only 2 possible outcomes:
- main chain hard forks to prevent UASF chain from possibly stopping it.   
- UASF chain wins
If the main chain hard forks * everyone in the industry will have to upgrade * in order to *protect against an eventual reorg to the chain with segwit active*.
This will never be promoted by core devs... who all want segwit.  It will never be promoted by exchanges... who all want segwit.
Who the hell is going to sell users on "1MB forever chain?".   And why would they install that hard fork software?   And will exchanges even list the new coin?
Miners already *know all of this*.   So they will panic-mine the new chain.

The purpose of bitcoin is a deflationary constant peg against which all other currencies are measured.
It's utility as a payment mechanism has always been secondary.   Within the next 2 years, bitcoin transactions will cost $20 and nobody will care.

1. It's completely off.   things are not drawn to scale 
2. It fails to account for liquidity.   If you had 1.5 bil in bitcoin, you could not "turn it into 1.5 bil fiat cash" unless you had a 6 months to do so.   Most of the Bitcoins in the world are locked up, lost, nLockTime'd or otherwise unusable.   In usable, spendable value, Bitcoin might be lucky to have $10bil in value.   Coins like "ripple" have value in the 10's of millions, but claim 13 *bil* in market cap.  
3. So not only is the infographic wrong, all of the underlying data is misleading as well.

think 100k is realistic within 10 years.   don't see why not.   there's a lot of downward pressure on liquidity as people move coins to cold storage, and this drives the price quite a bit.   100k is what, a 1 trillion valuation?   
that assumes that large numbers of people use bitcoin as "gold" to store away for an important purchase, like a house or college tuition, where it's protected both from inflation and government intervention.
which is, well, exactly what people use it for today.   if nothing changes about bitcoin, it will work fine as gold.
now, if layer 2 works out, we can get to the point where people are using it to buy coffee and lend money to each other.
then a valuation of $1mil is not unreasonable either.

Nice idea, but literally every study has shown that this is off by about an order of magnitude.  The reason is that the change in fee is a hockey-stick graph, not linear.
Bitcoin will always need full blocks and painful fees.   BIP103 is the best way to scale blocks.   Because it provides steady downward pressure at the radar of bandwidth growth.   It's essentially the perfect proposal.

No, the old chains coins are lost.   But it's OK, because the new chain has the combined value.   In the case of UASF, the "safer" chain to be on is the UASF chain - because it's a backward-compatible chainge there's no chance the chain will be wiped out.

If you go on market cap you're riding on air.  You might make money, you might lose money.   If you bet on technology and real usage - you will win, every time, in the long run.   
Bernie Madhoff's fund was worth $68 billion at it's peak.   Must have been better than Bitcoin!
ETH has cool tech, but it has no legitimate use cases except for a proliferation of ICO ponzi schemes.   This is the primary use case for ETH right now, the primary driver of its # of txns and value.    It could last forever.   Ponzi schemes are a traditional and common scam, and ETH makes them easy to execute.
But I don' think that's really going to sustain ETH in the long term.   Nobody who does business every day *actually uses* ETH on the street.  And nobody will *because of the way it's managed and run*.   
Bitcoin is trusted because it's extremely resistant to change.

It's actually quite amazing, because of the BGP-style routing ... a person with a couple of channels should be able to transact with anyone else that has a couple channels.   without segwit, hub-and-spoke is the most efficient model.   with segwit, it will be more of a web.

Because people have to realize:  Segwit was dead in the water.   there simply was no way for it to activate.   iI would never get more than 80%.   Now we have BIP148 and Segwit2x.   
Both of them get Bitcoin going in the right direction.
BIP148 is dangerous, and can cause a chain split.
Miners that want segwit to activate *have no choice* but to run Segwit2x.

SO was I.   ICO's are bullshit.   Bitcoin has been able to handle colored coin ICO's for years.   The only reason they are done on ETH is because the ETH foundation will stick their faces on them.

Jeff is working closely with core devs, and I think it will get merged into core in the end.   And it's only 2MB, not "big blocker".   And politics has nothing to do with why it was "delayed".... miners are delaying progress by failing to activate phase 1 of the scaling plan.
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:45:46
No, really, there aren't.    Blockchains are a shitty solution to a distributed ledger in all but one single case:   a public permissionless ledger.   
Once you've got permission, you don't need POW, you don't need blockchain.  You can use any of the many PBFT consensus solutions to get your distributed ledger... and you can get it with microsecond response time and no POW.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:31:29
If a robust layer 2 network allows fees to drive up to $40 coupled with 8mb blocks, that's equivalent to today's subsidy.  8mb is quite reasonable in 15 years.

Aug 1 is a done deal.   Segwit is going live.   The time to worry is Jan 1st.   That's when the compromise hard fork goes live, and nobody's even talking about how that's going to go down.   I think the network can handle it... if everyone upgrades.   
But man, if core doesn't merge in some form of compatible hard fork code... we will be with miners and 50% exchanges running one version and core and 50% exchanges running another.

I think it's abundantly clear that bitcoin was a reaction to the bank bailouts during the global mortgage backed derivative crisis.
In that respect Bitcoin is a 100% success.
The "layman" uses bitcoin instead of a savings account, so the Fed can't print cash and steal from him.   
It's ability to be used in commerce is a "nice to have" and it remains the best way to pay for a hotel room in Japan, a bag of weed and an unlimited eurorail ticket in sweden.

Doge is deliberately designed not to.  Infinite inflation and low block time keeps utility for cheap transactions at the expense of growth.

Game theory wise, does it make sense to hide?
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:57:37
DOGE is similar to fiat.   Somewhat centrally issued, high inflation.   But it is *less* central than most fiat and inflation will eventually be lower than fiat.      But that's like in 2035 or something.
DOGE actually works for things like "changetip" - in ways bitcoin doesn't.   But it does lose value pretty quickly over time (on average 2% per year).   So you should sell your doge for bitcoin when you get enough of it to afford the fee.

You cannot activate with 80pct unless you use segwit2x or bip91 or bip148. None of which are core.

Western union is 29tx/second.   But more than half of these are under $100 and will be better served by a lightning network or side chain.   4MB blocks gets us more than enough capacity to beat western union.

This does not force anyone to run anything but core &gt;= 0.13.2.   If miners begin mining blocks &gt; 1MB, then we'll see.   My guess is they will all be too afraid to, and rightly so.   You don't mine against bitcoin core.
This is a face-saving measure that will activate segwit, and allow miners to get very upset when core doesn't merge in the hard fork code.   It allows them to continue to rail against core... while activating UASF.
I firmly believe spoonet will get merged within a year anyway, and that there is no contingent within core that believes we should "never" hard fork.

Just some random guy.   Whatever, but I did sell a condo and buy bitcoin last month.....so I'm crazy too.  Granted, it was a cheap condo.   I bet if you look on this sub you can find a lot of people who did "crazy" things to obtain bitcoin.
Mostly, it's because I think: I need to out-risk someone richer than me.   I mean, some guy with $1mil lying around in a bank might say "hey i'm putting 5% in bitcoin".   I need to put 50% in bitcoin even to catch up to people like that.
The only thing holding me back from going even more all in (moving 401k in, etc) is that segwit isn't activated.   The whole "miner cartel dictating consensus protocol" scares me.

Sadly bitcoin is being held hostage right now by some miners who want to keep fees high.   Apparently they thing that this will not decrease the value of bitcoin so much, and they are happy making extra $$$.
1. Get miners to activate segwit, or wait for UASF (148/149/BIP91).   
2. Use the cheap segwit tx quickly to combine utxo's.   
3. Wait for schnor aggregate sigs to come out in the next soft fork (UASF only from now on, don't worry)
4. Use the aggregates to keep fees low.
Use DOGE! It will always support cheap transactions.

There are so many BIPs out there to raise block size in core.   Code, pull requests you name it.   BIP103, fore example would have had us 2MB non witness by 2018.   But it was ignored.   They all were.
Anyone pretending that "core devs" are preventing a block size increase has not paid attention to the sheer number of proposals being worked on.

Because ETH foundation rubber stamps them.   And there is no Bitcoin foundation to rubber stamp anything, and none of the devs would do this anyway.
