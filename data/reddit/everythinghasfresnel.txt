It's not as if transaction fees are only being added now. And you don't have to pay the fee anyways, your 'customer' does. If increasing the fee by a few sense removes all the benefit then bitcoin isn't for you.

Bitcoin hipsters. They do not want other people to know about this cool thing they use, because they will not be as unique if 100 million people are using it. They just prefer that bitcoin stop evolving and maturing because they have already got theirs. Some of them believe that financial freedom is scarce, and when other people start using Bitcoin, their financial freedom is somehow reduced.

The guy said, "Did you ever imagine that many people here are not interested in bitcoin having mass adoption?"
Why would anybody using bitcoin not want other people to use it too? More users equal greater utility and everybody wins. The only reason to be against new users is because they might not use bitcoin the same way we use it.

Wow, so it's possible that not enough miners would be present on either blockchain, and since since difficulty would not be adjusted for two weeks, both blockchains could come to a grinding halt since neither of them would have enough hashing power by themselves. This is flirting with disaster.

You don't just experiment willy nilly on a $8 billion software network. Too much can go wrong. It's better to test experimental ideas on a much smaller scale where there's much less risk involved. If the test is undeniably successful and can be written into Bitcoin without breaking anything else in the process, there's probably a good chance that your pull request will be approved.

Bullshit. Many buttcoiners attack bitcoin itself because they support inflation and quantitative easement. They think the central banks know better about how much our wealth should be devalued. They think having a finite number of bitcoins minted is suicidal because banks can't decide to print more at will. They're against a distributed public ledger system because we should just use credit cards to spend money we don't have instead.
I don't remember bitcoin patting themselves on the back because a dogecoin fraudster (moolah) sponsored a race car to try and pump up the price. It backfired and dogecoin has been dying ever since.

In that case so is iCloud. Better yet, don't use Dropbox either unless you want Condoleezza Rice all up in your shit.

It's only traded at one or two small exchanges though.

They still offer basic internet courses. Hell, my dad asked if he should take a class to learn about his iPad. They actually offer iPad courses at the local shop here. Bitcoin is more complicated than a fucking iPad.

Can't they just mine more transactions per block?

Judging by the flood of XT crap, it's obvious that the XT camp was just spamming with shitposts.

Consensus, which this fork does not have.

This should be stickied.

Then why did everyone lose their fucking minds? The spam test wasn't a secret and neither is the fact that bitcoin still has a lot of headroom.

No it obviously doesn't. Look around for two seconds!

Maybe you heard that bitcoin is volatile. This is what they mean.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:19:36
The censorship was caused by the illegitimate fork.

No, just a guy laughing at yet another gavin-jerk session. He's fooled you three times in a row!

well you need to read their rules more closely. it's not supposed to be an echo chamber AKA circlejerk. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 11:24:51
Look again. It says he got a combined total $1130 in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:25:10
well at least you admit it's a circlejerk. also an echo chamber. and maybe of them are delusional. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 09:01:28
It's true. There's not a single company that this community hasn't torn to shreds like cannibals.

I don't know about you but I'm in my early 40s. His age doesn't have anything to do with this and it's just being used as some derogatory trait. At your age, you should know better.
@_date: 2015-09-17 13:10:15
Of course in hindsight he'll think of ways he could have done things differently, but he didn't vilify the entire community. Were you here before the fiasco? The sub was filled with vitriol and shills for a long time. You're giving him too much credit because it's not his fault that there's not enough interesting news. People just don't shut up about block size shit. Everybody is sick of hearing about it except for shills. If you ask me he should get rid of all of that shit.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:03:15
Actually you would reduce the total number of bitcoins by 40 since they've been removed from the overall supply of 14.59 million. This would actually increase the market cap slightly since market cap is simply the total shares multiplied by market price per share. A better question is what the market cap would be if we knew how many of those 14.59 million bitcoins were actually unspendable. The more you know!

His accent and camera reversing really had me wondering if he's actually in Texas, but the sun is shining so he's definitely not in the UK. Is Fold even available in the UK?

This is so unbelievably stupid. Replace 'sidechains' with 'quantum computers', 'artificial intelligence', 'self-driving cars', or any number of evolving technologies. A hundred years ago you would be just as stupid to say the same thing about 'airplanes', 'automobiles', 'personal computers', etc. The fact that a cutting edge technology is not already commonplace is no indication that it will never be.
