You're assuming that there are no bidders that are willing to go above market price to beat out the other investors at lower prices. the existence of just one bidder willing to do that or the potential of one bidder doing that throws a monkey wrench into your theory doesn't it?

except you're not just buying them. yes the advantage is obvious to buy Bitcoins at a low price. but they are bidding for them blindly against other bidders. if you want coins you're going to have to make your bid just above what you think everyone else is willing to pay for them. and if everyone has that basic knowledge....... You do the math

You're forgetting that Linux powers one of the most popular Mobile devices in the world. Android. 
Also, if you watched Andreas's Senate hearing in Canada you might be singing a different tune. In terms of adoption and maturity Bitcoin is about where the Internet is in 1992. Maybe some of you are too young to know what that means but having been around during that time, it feels very much the same. Additionally, everyone thought the Internet was a joke at first, people didn't even know how to talk about it (kinda like btc today). The telecoms that were deeply entrenched in the communications industry thought no way the Internet could take over their turf. They were wrong too. It's way too early to say Bitcoin is just going to fall to the wayside because of old money and entrenched power structures. There's a ton of vc money in this space right now and growth is very rapid. 
That's just my 2c

Everyone is already using crypto every single day of their lives whether they know it or not. SSL being the obvious one here.

This sounds like a cross site request forgery attack and is something they should be mitigating against if they have a competent security team.
