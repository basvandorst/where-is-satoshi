Well I know a couple people who find small amounts of btc to be of great value. It is both something people wanna get paid with for items, and something people want to spend on things. Probably more than anyother alt coin

goat s? What in fucks name are you talking about

Its crazy because it was 400 last year this time.. I bought like a whole coin at that time but i didnt hold on to it wish i did
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:56:06
What? I mean I spent the bitcoin. I didn't. you know, not spend it and keep it. If I did I would be sitting on about 900 something bucks right now that I paid 400 for.

Are you talking about cash? Not sure what world you live in but cash is plenty valuable for me. I can't really pay my rent or get groceries with bitcoin... I mean maybe I could but it would be strange especially since I would have to buy bitcoins with my paycheck

So is there a way I can have it drop and just get the money back in bitgo wallet? I'm so mad I even used bitgo at all

You get more actual cake now then you would have earlier this week, for the same amount of money. Kind of like getting a good deal on any thing. Complicated stuff

You're talking about the double send method right? Can i send a very small amount with a sizable fee, to the same address and have them both go through?

Well how long is a block dick head? Sorry i'm not such a genius like you but it only took 30 minutes in the past. Thought the bitcoin sub might have useful insight
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:36:33
yea doesn't tell me shit. Every other time took about 20 mins. So no suggestions on getting my money?
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:29:51
Thank god it came thru
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:59:59
It's crazy that with all of this, nobody has taken any legal action or recourse against them

I believe it was localbitcoins i used many months ago, someone with high standing or ratings on the site got me to buy an amazon gift card, TWICE, (had to be paid with cash) stole all the money off of one and never gave me anything. Thats why i don't like the random seller method
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:44:18
Honestly dude, I went through that entire list and none of them really worked for me. I can't go to any atms, It has to work from Florida, I want to pay with my credit card. I don't get how there is nothing good. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 02:05:57
yes but keeping peoples money?
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:14:58
Quesion about bitsquare. What would be the easiest way to get money from my credit card onto my account? It is also saying there are no trades available, do I have to wait until someone comes along to sell me some
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:07:00
Coinbase is shit honestly they should pay for all this somehow
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:46:03
I'm looking into this (have iPhone) I can only find mycelium wallet. Does mycelium have something like coinbase where I can buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:53:23
Ok thank you for this, I'm downloading bitsquare now. Watched the video and it looks pretty good

Circle seems cool but it's a 3-5 day wait just to verify my ID :/
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:10:54
Circle has me waiting 3-5 days to verify my ID. Is there any place at all, I can walk in, get my coins at a good price and be on my way no bs
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:46:10
I mean I don't pay my own rent or power water bill any of that... What else could I use? Phone bill is online..
