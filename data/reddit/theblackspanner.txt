That ship sailed long ago.

Looks like someone is guilty of badthink.
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:37:15
Also sounds ridiculous. Why don't people who make videos learn how to speak properly?

My second attempt has been pending for nearly 24 hours.

Do you make a new reddit account every time you get drunk?

I'm a dummy. An extremely wealthy dummy.

Looks like yet another half-baked scheme. First thing I tried was transferring $10 from my credit card. Got message 'transaction failed'. Asked support for a reason, got no reply. Still waiting.

So the fall in price shattered his illusions? How would he prefer that his illusions be shattered, that's what I'm wondering.

Bad means what it says, don't proceed until you track down the problem.

I have been trying Circle out and unfortunately it is bit crap. My first two cc deposits were marked as failed, and I got some waffly excuse about fraud prevention. Then they started working, but there is a maximum weekly limit of $500. So now it works well but is not of much use. I can see they could easily make it much better, just remove the limits and get rid of that godawful front page with the happy campers all over it.

I will give them a second chance. But I'm getting tired of shit that doesn't work.

bank transfer with bisq. localbitcoins for cash.

Yes bisq is working well, but there is not enough people using it. Needs more propaganda.

It's a hijacked account: 
last transaction years ago.

Bitcoins do things which normal money can't. You can send them to anyone anywhere quickly and cheaply with no oversight or intermediary or third party involvement. They cannot be stolen or confiscated by anyone, so long as you have a firm grip of computer security. These factors alone are sufficient to ensure their usefulness, and useful things don't disappear.

Those who pontificate on subjects of which they do not have a full understanding are sure to talk a load of bollocks, whether their intentions are good or not.

Here in the UK, there used at one time to be such a thing as a "dog licence". Many people found that their dogs worked just fine without one.

" Finance ministers, ambassadors, central bank officials, etc, are being flown in in droves"
exaggerate much?
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:14:27
I think you should sell all your bitcoins. Soon as you can please.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:54:50
My experience has been that they don't actually send any bitcoins. If you have a firm grip on your computer I don't think there is much to worry about.
