You know its illegal, right?

This is really stupid. Solar PV has a capacity factor of 15%, do miner is going to mine fo 15% of time because the hardware get absolete in months.
Batteries are insanely expensive so solar is no option.

My wallet is not syncing and have no idea why...

Whats dream market?
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:27:30
Who do you transact with?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:52:06
We lot BitPay traffic, its not spam.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:57:52
You can do that with Dash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:32:54
Not all cryptos will be obsolete. BTC is not good for M2M and Iot. 
IOTA is much better for that.
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:51:46
Problem is that what the population wants is 9 times out of 10 wrong for them.
Ask your neighbour if he wants to pay less taxes and have better functioning gov'nt.

Two questions:
1. What if two people accidentally created the same wallet offline?
2. When does the wallet get added to the blockchain? The first time i verify if it is valid or first time when I transfer money? If the second does that mean that wallets with zero BTC are not part of blockchain?
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:45:45
And then a malware will change your clipboard contents so that bitcoins will go to annother wallet when u make a transfer. Voila.
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:41:34
If the wallets are created offline, how does the network/blockchain ever find out that they exist? How does that work?
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:02:18
Someone created a lot of cash , and made an order at double the price, to suck BTC out of the market.
I think the have cleared the hot wallet that way.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:42:18
It is slow and expensive already.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:21:23
Can bitcoin get in trouble if difficult stays too high and no new blocks are discovered?
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:02:43
OMG you are me.

In Czech Republic winters are short, so no need to heat all year long.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:58:50
Good for them. Winter is however only for a few months, for the rest heating is not needed in most places.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:00:46
Why thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:22:59
Since you need to heat tomatoes only for a few months, and miners work 24/7 its not really very much sustainable. Heat will be wasted anyway for the most time.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:52:58
You have a strange definition of what is true and whats not.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:55:10
For 15% of time?
Good luck with that.

Al Gore had nothing to do with it, it was discovered almoast 100 years ago by Svante Arhenius. 
Please educate yourself, don't be ignorant. Thank you.

For a heafty price of 350 000 000 $. 
It's hardly free. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:27:46
How about this one? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:54:31
Stupid. Ever read about climate change?
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:55:16
Two problems with this: no power at night. In fact only 15% of time this is working at full capacity. So you need to overbuild. 
And you need 20 g of silver in each m2 of solar PV panel. 
There is not enough silver in the world to power earth's grid in your dumb idea. Not to calculate the copper needed to transmit this energy all around the world in the night. 
I think you do not understand the concept of capacity factor too.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:00:13
Its not a problme of the crop, but outside temperature.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:47:24
I think you miss the realities. 
Humans already have engineered themselves out of that problem. Sweden has decarbonised energy grid with nuclear and hydro at 50% each. France has decarbonized energy grid with a whooping speed of 3% per year. Also with nuclear. That is how fast we need to do that to reach 2050 with 80% decarbonization.
Renewables will never do it alone. 100% renewable scenario is a myth. You can see it failing in Germany as we speak. The CO2 emissions are the same as they were in 2009.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:41:54
No. Solar PV has capacity factor of 15%. Bitcoin miners need to work at 100% to be able to pay for themselves

Not at the price the bit coin is today.

It's not a a currency so it is a subject to VAT taxation! Read wikipedia in pl.
