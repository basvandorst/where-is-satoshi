News orgs need to vet their stories inside and out. The headline is a major -- if not *the* most major -- part of the story; often, it is the only part that the vast majority of readers view. It doesn't matter if the rest of the story sticks to facts. This is FAKE NEWS and is spreading FUD.

You'll be fine if it's a few thousand. Be careful, obv. If you're talking millions, then that's a very bad idea. Anything over felony tax evasion limit, and it's not worth it.

Honest question, are you in middle school?

Buy, buy, buy!

Not worth gambling 2.6% when the volatility is so high. That's picking pennies in front of a steam roller.

Yeah...that's patently untrue. I don't think there's quite anything as cringe as the "GEOTUS" and "daddy" terms Trumpers use to refer to Trump.

Not true. Twitter does not verify fan pages, from my knowledge. The original McAfee twitter account is a verified account, while the fake fan page is not verified. I think OP was going for that point.

Can you tell me how you plan on cashing out? I'm curious, and if it's a legit method, I might try it too.

This just made me break out laughing. That poor sap.

Backed by what, exactly? Do you even understand what a stock is? I LOVE BTC and have a lot invested in it, but please stop making us look like idiots. BTC is not a stock.
It's hardly even a currency due to its volatile swings. If you buy a shitty car today for 1 BTC, you could be paying $100,000 for it a year down the road. Right now, it's barely anything more than a speculative vehicle. It will burst sooner or later, but that's when you buy, buy, buy.

I think right now most people "use" Bitcoin as a speculative vehicle first, and a store of value second. The people who actually use bitcoin as the currency of the future are a distant third, IMO.
Politics hardly plays a role in making money; to that end, I think it's not ironic that a lot of anti-trumpers/globalists/statists also hold bitcoins and are pro free trade.

Uhh...in other words, I want a non-inflationary USD by any other name? Why not just campaign to get back on the gold standard? It's probably easier.

No regulations = not criminal by definition.
And that’s a good thing. Less regulation the better.

Less than 10%? That's significantly lower than what's charged in the US, and in many first-world nations. Are you sure that's correct?
