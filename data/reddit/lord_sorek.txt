No, thats situation you get now. Every involve in free market, make free market non-free.

Market should be free but it should always be pro-consumer. I mean - there need to be a law to enforce those who try to gain money on cheating people - for example. It is possible to do it quite easily - you just need to go back to USA at the end of XIX century ;)

Yes and no. Because governments let control lobbies from cartels to control market (for example, to became a taxi driver, you need to pass a lot of tests etc.). And making getting into business harder for everyone.

Ok, lets imagine. You set up everyone to put their money into a jar (let say everyone in one country).
Everybody puts 10% of their monthly income per month. Let say avarage monthly income for all person in our imagined country is $1000
What happens is that for jar where are 1000 (hypothetically) in country, every month you get 100 000$ into the jar. 1/10 is distributed amont 1000 people, so everyone gets 10$ increasing by ~9 every month (initially).
If we keep going for few years we will have quite nice money income, that is ok.
BUT, we are left with 2 issues:
1. Meaningless jar with a lot of money - we cannot touch it as the owner of the jar will just be rich as hell. What does money mean in it? What do you want to do with those money in future? Destroy it? It will cause deflation of money but..
2. If you would give every man in one country 1000$ each month for free - at first nobody would want to work, and after: nobody would want to do anything. This would mean, no man would go outside to do any stuff at all! This would cause everyone would cause employers would need to increase wages and by that: increase costs of product.
That means inflation and unproductiveness! This would ground the economy in a few bits and probably will make that currency to go nowhere.
But, we are talking about bitcoin which could end someday - at this point, we just can run out of money at some point and later cause deflation that big, noone really would want to buy anything any more.
Sir go1dfish, have you calculated that in economic environment? In other ways it is just not gonna work.
If I am wrong please correct me.

How you gonna get everybody enough money if it depends on those who put money into the jar?
If there is noone who want to put inside, there is noone to take out.
So people who earn money should put money into the jar, and others can take? What if we run out of people that want to put anything into the jar?
Could you explain to me how this could be working in economical way? I am really curious.

Can you ELI5? I would love to understand what it does.
It makes bitcoin out of nothing or what?
@_date: 2013-07-17 16:03:59
I can reccomend Bitcurex.com
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:06:55
I use bitcoin to transfer money from netherland bank to my another account in Poland. It's fucking insane how easy, fast and cost free it is. Unfortunately, last time if I would only wait 3 hours more exchanging bitcoins for PLN I would get like 25E more from every bitcoin :(
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:19:15
bitcurex.com is also nice ;)

It's easy. Look, I got a Netherlands bank account, a Polish Euro bank account, and normal Polish PLN bank account.
NB - Netherlands bank account,
PEB - Polish euro bank account,
PLNB - Polish PLN bank account.
So, assume I work somwhere in netherlands and I got my money on PEB (wich I made in Poland) and I want to send tell - 100E to my familly I need to transfer money.
BUT I need to pay for "transfering" Euros to PLN wich isn't really cool cause banks got their 0.05C difference between normal course.
So: PEB &lt;=&gt; PLNB - difference 5E - not big with 100E, but still not nice.
So I made my NB wich and there is another problem.. When transferring money to pay for something in netherlands (for example I bought notebook on martplaats) I need to transfer money to somone's else NB.
NB &lt;==&gt; PEB - I need to pay 15-20 Euro (depends on cash I send, but never less than 10E I think) to bank and then, change my money to PLN with bank so.. addtional 5E - NOT COOL.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:55:05
So what to do? I just take all my cash from my PEB here (cuz it's free) and put this into my NB account here in netherlands (also my employer now send me money on my NB account). So I can pay anywhere in Netherlands as I like, especialy with iDeal wich is instant payment. Then what I do if I want to transfer money to my PLNB? Easy, I just go on some kind of website (I used  - its cool I think) and then buy bitcoins and instantly send them to my pln.bitcurex.com (there is also eur.bitcurex.com) and then they send me money to my PLNB without (nearly) any addtional cost ;) I did it within one day in hour (It needed to get 6 confirmations of BTC sending).

@_date: 2013-11-25 02:05:48

@_date: 2013-11-26 22:08:43
Ill tell you something.. If I would get now 10 bitcoins, in my country. I would never have to work again..
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:21:32
