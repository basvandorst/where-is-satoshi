I trade stocks for a living. It's not confidence it's just experience. Market making and liquidity stabilizes prices.

So many outages
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:45:53
Nasty. The dump happened mostly overnight in the US too. Asia must have panic sold.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:24:44
Another outage coming right up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:24:29
Still dumping...

IB just lifted their ban on short Bitcoin futures.

This is the case for any type of trading instrument. Every Finance grad who half payed attention in their classes knows this.

In the future, you will die.

ITT: People who watch way too many movies.
If anything, the futures trading should stabilize Bitcoin. The goal is to make the market, not fuck it up more.

If there's gonna be a huge selloff, tonight would be the night. Asia is awake right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:34
Crazy difference in exchanges right now. Arb opportunity?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:11
Yep, looks like the futures are stabilizing the price. I guess this is the end of super volatile crazy Bitcoin and the start of boring Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:48:28
I think if there's gonna be a crash it'll be at night in the US when Asia is awake...

Eh, that jump was just a little uncertainty from the opening. But going forward we are not going to see the kind volatility that we've seen in the past. The huge influx of liquidity and market making algos will keep it in check. There will still be massive moves but they will happen over a much longer timeframe.

Wow huge range the last 30 minutes...
