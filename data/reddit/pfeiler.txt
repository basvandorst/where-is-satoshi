I exactly thought that when Dan Bilzerian bought "a Sh**Load of Bitcoin" at ~$2.500, posting that with an image from the fitness studio *ugh*. 
Look were we are now. BTC is a "peak hype and overvalued"-resistant coin.

From TenX slack bot: "*Card orders and activations* are currently available from the Android App. *Orders are disabled for now* to ensure we can scale the platform correctly and not introduce bugs as more users come on board. [*UPDATE 13/07:* We will soon be moving to a queue system and enabling card orders for everyone.] For anyone waiting on a *delivery*, it should arrive any day. We are shipping out cards as fast as we can with our limited resources. Thanks for your patience."

With the TenX card you will be able pay with all cryptocurrencies, not BTC  only. You can choose the crypto via the tenx app just right before you pay.

Very good find. I contacted the tenx support about it.

Whitepaper: "Users earn a 0.1% reward for every purchase they make. This incentive will be transferred to the user in form of PAY tokens initially on a monthly basis, which additionally gives them the opportunity to become token holders and further benefit from
a potential value upside of the tokens (see the section below entitled “TenX Initial Token Sale” for further details). Going forward, TenX aims to distribute the reward more
frequently, with a target of reward distribution on an hourly basis"
I should mention that I bought a considerable stack of PAY tokens during the ICO. So yes .. I am biased, but also happy that the product works as promised.

Absolutely flawless .. inserted the card in the machine, punched in the 4 digits pin .. 5 really tense seconds later everybody was happy. While opening the tenx app i already got an email that the transaction has happened. A notification from the app and the app showed the transaction as well ... this is a perfect product and meets all expectations .. so impressive.
