@_date: 2017-12-21 09:06:04

@_date: 2017-12-31 07:09:02
how long do you think it will take because my weekly limit is 500 on coinbase/gdax yes i know about the free fee to gdax to wallet. and many of my australian exchanges are having issues etcc and are taking a long time to take deposits 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:49:22

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:20:25
ive been deciding whether i should get a trezor or ledger nano s
Currently im on blockchain info do u recommend any other online wallets? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:35:41
i really want to purchase POWR and trezor can support it through MEW. hmm thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:04:08
What do u mean true support 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:10:17
It’s definitely not a goner

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:01:24
ether is low fees. but i wouldnt recommend using blockchain as a wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:59:08
is it gonna drop this low? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:59:56
i have some but thinking of whether to purchase more altcoins or bitcoin and since bitcoin price is quite low im leaning towards bitcoin thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:06:17
The price of bitcoin is quite low so I’m gonna buy some now then in the next few weeks I’ll buy more powr iota icx 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:25:47
do you reckon i should get out of blockchain or just wait till i get the trezor /ledger
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:27:13
