Many foolish investors have come before you my friend.

The problem is when a crash occurs, be it a day from now or a year from now, you likely won't be able to sell fast enough, and will sustain a large loss .  It will be like a run on banks, these exchanges won't be able to handle the amount of selling that takes place and you'll be sitting there hitting the sell button again and again but to no avail, and the price will far further and further.  A BTC Black Tuesday is coming, and the movie they make about it, will be great.

They are selling a Monopoly game coin but instead of it saying Monopoly it says bitcoin.  Like monopoly money, there is no value attached to this product.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:02:44
Yea, but at the same time I'm certain I would have sold before this record high.  So I think of it as losing a few grand rather than 10 of thousands, shitty still, but easier to deal with mentally.

If you haven't learned yet, applying stock market rules and ideals to the bitcoin market isn't wise. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:48:43
If there is a crash and panic ensues your stop loss will be blown by, but you'll still end up better than most...assuming your exchange doesn't crash and is able to submit a sell order.

Give credit to yolo where you stole this from.

Create the person a paper wallet add some bitcoin to it, print it on cardstock with a design and put in a card.  That makes more sense than buying a worthless token.

Never mix emotions with investments.

And there is a set open and closing for futures, probably 9:30-4:00pm eastern.    
Just read this...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:54:29
Nah, I'll play the swings.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:26:06
Any number of external forces.

Hey everyone, treat bitcoin like a stock because it's acted that way all year, right?

What if i told you it's going to be substantially lower than that by Xmas?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:40:08
Hours?  Try days, the markets will crash, which actually could help stem the bitcoin crash as people wont be able to get in their orders to sell, kind of like how the stock market will shutdown once a certain lose threshold is it.
That said, people said the housing market would implode years before it actually did.

You're charging $20 for a plastic coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:06:16
No worries, we'll hit it by April.

Y'all got sum of that Bitcoin?

It's a complex model you wouldn't understand but it starts with the assumption that a gallon of milk costs $100,000. I then extrapolate and deviate the septum until I'm no longer a mouth breather.

Lot of money to be made off people who attach emotions to an investment.

Timing a crypto market?  Nope.

If the money ain't easy I don't want it!!!

Unless someone can provide factual evidence as to why bitcoin would keep surging, everything that people say is fud.

Sometimes I want to eat a whole box crackers but that shit will upset my stomach, I do it anyways and then I'm like damn I feel sick, why didn't I do this days ago?

It would be bad for BTC.  The tax man will pull the plug on markets, block access, etc, if they don't get there's.

What is causing it's massive bubble?

*Using robust statistical techniques, we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to DJIA component stocks over 1/1/1992 – 31/12/2002 period. Neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance.*
It's all bullsh*t

I bought a 50/50 raffle ticket once and won $4,000 15 minutes later.  Good timing, dumb luck, both? Nah, expert 50/50 raffle investor.

Well, there are a ton of people who are underwater now.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:59:04
Flip a coin, it's 50/50 when it drops and if it's slight or massive.

LOL, please keep posting you’re making my sides hurt but it’s worth the lols.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:45:08
Or just use your phone?  Who would use this to buy/sell?

Lack of stabilization.  I'll take my pay in greenbacks backed by the worlds strongest military, thank you. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:00:40
basically a moving goal post so one can always be right and never wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:03:07
you just contradicted yourself.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:33:32
Or this is real life and that’s a movie.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:56
Guessing you used that minute to sell before he could.
@_date: 2018-07-07 05:30:51
Cept’ that worthless dollar is backed by the worlds most powerful military.

 Genuine leather for the strap.  Why?
@_date: 2019-09-13 18:33:43
Genuine leather is low grade, I'd expect a better strap at this price point.

I thought banks were the bubble that popped?  Oh, well it sounded good at the time and made a nice meme.
