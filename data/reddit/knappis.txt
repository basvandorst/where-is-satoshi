2k buttcoiners beats 131k bitcoiners. Does that mean one butt is worth ~ 65 BTC?

As I understand it transaction fees are payed in Bitcoins. What happens if Bitcoin takes off and is traded at $10k. Will the fee then be ~$0.80?

the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been tried from time to time." - Winston Churchill
Thing is, we are humans and humans have evolved to what we are today. And while democracy isn't perfect it is the best we got. It sure beats a system where people just do as they please on purely egoistic grounds when building large societies. 
At least we have a mechanism for change (I.e. elections) and when that isn't enough there is revolution. 
You can always try to find a way to leave society if you don't like the rules (e.g. Moving deep into the wilderness), or try to find another country with rules you are more comfortable with.

I can see many problems with the American democratic system (e.g. funding and lobbying) as well as som socioeconomic structures (large income and wealth inequality, expensive education and healthcare) that lead to poor voting behaviour and you should try to form opinion to change it for the better. There are many other democratic system in place in different parts of the world, each with its own set of problems.

If price was stable (i.e. non volatile) and a currency deflationary, it would be used as an alternative to a savings account. If the whole economy was based on a stable deflationary currency, less would be spent and invested because these two options has to compete with the increased value of just holding. Contrast that with a stable inflationary currency were the sooner you invest or spend the more value you gain (other things constant).
But if price is completely decided by a fluctuating demand it will become volatile and lend itself to speculation. You don't want an economy built on speculation so central banks will try to even out demand by changing supply to reduce volatility and stabilise the economy. This, of course, is not possible with bitcoin so it will remain volatile and mainly be used for speculation (and transactions). If you don't want to speculate you should never hold on to more bitcoins than you need right now. This is the reason some people "spend" their coins on fiat and it is not spending per se, it is moving some of their capital out of speculation.
But why are we even discussing this, bitcoin has always been highly inflationary and will be for years to come.

How do you know that? Besides, if you have 19k bitcoins to play with I am sure you can set up your own tumbler, it may just take some time to tumble it all.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:55:20


And that is a good thing. It makes people willing to spend and invest instead of just hoarding. Investing your $$ in bitcoin (i.e. hoarding) is not adding anything useful to the economy. Investing it in bonds or the stock market will help grow businesses. If all we had was bitcoins, the economy would slow down and everyone would become poorer. You should thank FRB and fiat for your wealth, not speculative commodities like bitcoin (i.e. unless you are one of the early adopters like in any MLM).

It would be interesting to see how bitstamp would handle a request to cash in from one of the adressess associated with the hack. But otherwise, there is no blacklist (yet) and all bitcoins are treated equally. 
A simple tumbler is just a wallet that splits and mixes deposits and withdrawals from many (thousands?) different people/wallets/adressess often with som random fee attached so you cannot simply add them together to match what goes in and out. Thus, even if all the bitcoins in the tumbler are "dirty" you wouldn't know where a specific transaction originated once they leave the tumbler. And then they might be tumbled again... A more advanced version would split deposits and withdrawals between two or more different wallets so there is no connection att all between transactions on the blockchain. 
There are probably even more elaborate schemes out there but the basic principle would be similar and I expect the hacked coins to be split up and transferred around many different adressess and mixed with plenty of other coins, some dirty and some not. When they are eventually cashed out, the coins will be tainted by so many sources that you wouldn't be able to tell where they came from.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:55:17
One coin to rule them all, right? Yeah, I guess in a limited market it makes sense to consolidate what little there is (left) into a single entity, and trade volume has indeed picked up for BTC since november. It has even been larger than the 2013 bubble.

Well I guess it depends on how you define spikes. If you define them as an increase with 10x in a short time I guess they all will be 10x at least. But if you look at data there have been several "spikes" where price almost doubled in a few weeks after All Time High (ATH): 
There is one big difference with the ATH spike and the ones before it. Before the ATH spike, price quickly stabilised at the new level but since ATH we have been in a long term trend downwards, probably because of the artificially blown up prices in the ATH bubble from Willy bots that takes time to adjust. Thus, it seems the price have yet found it's equilibrium after the bubble pushing the price downwards and making the "spikes" smaller.

Market prize was manipulated in 2013 with the sole purpose of making some people rich. I am sure there are attempts to manipulate it now too, but on a much smaller scale. The more than a year negative trend is not manipulation but an indication of the market slowly recovering from the last one.

Actually, there was as much selling as there was buying.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:16:25
Fair point. But currencies get their value in trade meaning with no trade there is no value. A large trade volume helps to set a reasonably stable price which reduce the need for constant exchange against fiat.
Having several crypto currencies with reasonable trade volume would be a general health indicator of crypto currencies and its adoption. Seeing them fail one after the other not so much. Granted, Bitcoin has a special status but is obviously fighting an uphill battle right now as indicated by falling prices in higher trade volume.

High fees = 0.22% transfer fee and 1% withdrawal fee?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:18:19


It did that in the 2013 ATH bubble because of Willy bots and mass hysteria. It seems price is slowly adjusting back to more reasonable levels with tons of sell pressure from hoarders and failed speculators that sees their perceived wealth being eroded by time.

When you buy bitcoin you increase the value of all bitcoins owned by others. No wonder they all want you in.
The euro might be tanking now but bitcoin has been tanking more for longer. Buy if you want to speculate with money you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:00:24
I get it, you bought in and want others to follow to make you rich. It may work, but that doesn't mean that a deflationary currency is good for the economy. It only means it is good for you personally, if, and only if, others buy into it too. 
That said, I do see some potential merit in bitcoin as a transaction medium.
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:48:31


This is the cheapo option of course. But there are plenty of people on the darknet that needs to obfuscate the source of their bitcoins. I am sure there are many tumblers set up for those purposes.   
The next step is to laundry the coins to look like some legitimate income. But that is a whole different problem from hiding the fact that possess coins stolen from bitstamp.

He forgot the best thing with a deflationary currency which is that you don't need a bank to earn "interest". You can just sit on your coins and they will slowly increase in value. There is no need nor any incentive to spend or invest them elsewhere. No wai....

Sure, I can agree to that; but OP called it a currency and as such it sucks. You should never hold bitcoins longer than it takes to complete a transaction, unless you want to speculate. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:10:41
Pretty useless as a currency when it can lose or gain 30% of its value in a few days. Also, it is slow and comes with a hefty transaction fee making it way worse than even paypal.
It is more like digital tulips. You can buy and hold them to speculate on future prices and maybe get rich.
