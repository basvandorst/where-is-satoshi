Yep. Coinbase just 'lost' my 11.5 litecoin I transferred today. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:05:35
Thanks man, I appreciate it
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:56:29
I can't. Coinbase shows that they transferred the litecoin to my GDAX, but there's no record of me ever receiving it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:20:13
Smart money doesn't follow others beliefs, you're right. They follow their own. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:11:19
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:58:55
and if you buy before the end of 2017, all of your 2018 gains will be taxed at 15% instead of 30+% (assuming you hold over a year)
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:56:02
I'm not saying to believe blindly... 
I'm saying your own research = your belief in the crypto market. There will always be those who know more about the technology than you do, so don't assume doing your own research is more than just believing in your own judgement. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:09:33
As someone living in California, thank you for this clarification
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:47
Lmao, I did the same. Started making more $$ day trading than my day job, so I quit. Now my assets are tied up and I'd rather hold &amp; wait for it to rise back up again. 
Also, to be fair, I quit my job for other reasons than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:18
Yep, people are dumb af. I see your point. Luckily it doesn't apply to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:40:52
Hope that was sarcasm. If not.... good luck buddy.

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:41:49
You won't go to jail unless you're evading a LOT of taxes. Mostly likely just get a hefty fine and your credit report won't look to great. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:18:17
Wake up call, that's the world we live in. Morality doesn't walk the same line as the law. Most modern day societies thrive on government taxation... obviously the taxpayers aren't going to agree with everything the government taxes. 
Sure, you may argue you are still morally in the right for evading tax, and that you feel you have a right to defend your hard earned assets. Still doesn't change the fact it's illegal. Evade at your own risk, many still make it out alive... Looking at you, Apple. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:53:51
That's fine. Many people trust the government. Just don't trust them blindly. Keep your mind open to those more knowledgeable to you, as those are learning opportunities. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:13:36
I don't THINK bitcoin is going to go one way or the other, but I'm preparing for anything to happen. Anything regarding the future of bitcoin, idealistic or not, is just speculation, and ultimately if you're going to make any money off it you have to put your money where your beliefs are. 
I believe bitcoin will regain its value even after a prolonged recession, and therefore I'm investing like it will. If it never ever ever reaches $12k again in our lives, then I will have lost my game with bitcoin (if breaking even can be considered losing), but not with the other cryptos that'll take its place. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:55:32
Nice! I'm doing a journey to 1BTC myself, but with day trading. I'm halfway there!

That's the internet for ya. The most rudimentary form of human nature, at times. All good though, let them do their thang. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:07
Good luck. Take some advice from me when I bought at 1,100 three years ago.... if it crashes, just hold onto it. I wish I had the BTC I had back then, but figured it was gonna keep crashing so I sold at 800.

@_date: 2017-12-06 06:25:16
Just being real. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:18:56
It makes sense because it compares to the US dollar? It's a global currency tho
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:02:38
Exactly. Knowledge doesn't lie within analyzing graphs. Knowledge lies within getting the inside scoop, which is usually obtained by paying the people with said scoop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:00:25
HA, that made me lol. But yes, LTC, IOTA, ARK, and RaiBlocks once they get onto an exchange I use. Those aren't reasons I quit my job though, in all seriousness. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:43:40
Only thing I know is to NEVER tell anyone your private key. Nobody from any customer service will have a legit reason to ask for your private key. I'm sure the phishing attempts will start running rampant once the older generations start dipping their toes into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:36:02


No. Not at all. That'd be placing a value on something purely based off its speculated value. 
Everyone who has their reasons and has done their research on bitcoin will come to different conclusions, both for or against the long term value of bitcoin. There are some really convincing arguments on both sides of it, and neither one is "correct" because so many things can happen in the future. Ultimately, you have to believe in your own research, and speculate a price for it yourself, otherwise you're falling victim to the hive mind of regurgitated misinformation. 
Besides, if you think internet research is good research, you're doing it wrong. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:25:21
Can confirm. Paypal stole my $2,000 after they found out I was using their services as a minor. (Technically they froze the funds until I was of-age, but then they conveniently lost it. I filed as part of the class action lawsuit against paypal mysteriously losing millions of customer's funds, but I've gotten nothing in return.)
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:07:19
I disagree. Maybe 4 years really makes a difference, but I know a 12 year old who's saved up a couple thousand bucks because he never spends anything. He's been urging his older siblings to invest into stocks and bonds, and maybe even bitcoin if they feel risky. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:57:13
What do you even mean it's no longer usable? "the backers of core will get their way."? Get outta here with that shit, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:23:35
Yep, exactly. Gotta learn somehow. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:42
I'll check it out! I'm more interested in the underlying technology of the coins I invest in, rather than to make a quick buck. Anywhere you could point me to learn more about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:57:30
Or they just googled "top bitcoin exchanges". That's what I did, and a few places mentioned cryptsy. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:45:39
Well, walls can move. It's not like those coins are permanently set at $13,500. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:41
Not sure what XTR is, but if it's worth looking into then I'll spend some time researching it. Dogecoin makes me lol. Played around with that for a little while on some online gambling sites. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:23:07
Thanks for the warm wishes and the extra advice! I'm dropping a drinking and smoking habit while I'm there, so I'll be sure to pay attention when I get back from vacation. I don't need my bad habits sneaking up on me again. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:14:03
Good point. I'm only using gdax at the moment, and I don't mess with margin trading. I don't make too much money from it, but it keeps me active and on my feet, and has allowed me to take some time off work to focus on my own business ventures... so it's been a blessing to me thus far. Thanks for the discussion :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:58:14
I will buy. I have money saved up to buy incrementally all the way down to $1,500, thanks to limit orders. Bring it on, Wall Street.

Not at all - I'm going to Tasmania with my girlfriend of 5 years to visit an uncle who lives out there with his wife and two young'uns. Nobody expected that he'd get married, let alone have kids... so hopefully I'll learn a thing or two from him. We have a lot of similarities, but he's definitely much wiser than I.

I wouldn't use the word predictable...
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:45:42
Aaaaaand i'm broke
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:04:11
Well, i day trade bitcoin currently. I've almost doubled my assets, and once I do that I'm withdrawing half my funds to invest in other new cryptos. I'm okay with bitcoin dropping in price because I believe I can make more money from it than it can drop in price. Even if shit hits the fan and I lose 90% of the money I have in bitcoin, I still have other assets invested in other coins. 
Beyond all that, my journey in bitcoin started when I said "what if I invest in bitcoin instead of going to Vegas?" So I really have nothing to lose since I expected I would have lost it during my weekend in vegas anyways. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:49
I'm young, still figuring out my life, have no dependents, about to embark on a 2 month vacation to reflect on myself and where I want to go in life, and I have quite a bit of disposable income leftover. Plus I really hated my work environment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:03:57
bitcoin.tax is the website I use for calculating my taxes. I paid 20 bucks for their paid version, but it's free up to 300 transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:09:00
Eh, even if I buy a couple at 6k and it drops to 2k and stays there for two years, I don't mind keeping the ones I bought at a higher price locked up in a wallet until further notice. 
I have bad experience trying to time the bottom of the dip.

So he should type out the URLs manually, then? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:05:47
Just as with stocks, you can do research within cryptocurrencies to analyze what they're planning to do with their technology. It all depends on how well you research and understand the underlying technology, but also depends on how well you can analyze the technology with new upcoming technologies. If you're on the cutting edge of knowledge, the sky is the limit as long as you have confidence in what you're investing in. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:48:11
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:30:20
Hahah, no worries. To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the level of sarcasm in OP's meme.

@_date: 2017-12-05 22:56:13
Suit yourself. Just don't cash out at a high value and expect the IRS not to notice sooner or later. It's much like speeding - many people get away with it. Until they don't. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:05:47


That's a pretty high amount. I don't even think that percentage of people holding the US dollar can explain to you what fiat is. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:13:57

Thanks for the discussion :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:28:57
I'm not, it's complete speculation. I'm setting up limit orders all the way down to 2k so I can hopefully catch the entire dip. I truly believe bitcoin will rise higher than 12k in the future, so say I buy one bitcoin at every $500 increment from 10k down to 2k, I'll have around 16 bitcoins that'll be making me money the entire rise back to the top. 
If bitcoin never rises higher than, say, 6k, then I would have lost money from the bitcoins I bought at 7k, 7,500, 8k, etc... unless I keep them in storage until bitcoin hits those prices again. 
That's what it comes down to, I suppose. Do you believe bitcoin will hit these prices again in the future? If yes, buy the dip all the way down!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:55:14
Oh, TIL!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:11:42
I'm at a million tears. If that counts. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:52:20
Adoption rate isn't consistent. Panic selling can ensue before it rises to another ATH. That's what OP was getting at.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:47:53
And don't forget that every time it crashes, there are thousands of articles "proving" why bitcoin has "always been" a bubble and is now on it's downward spiral, never to return to another ATH. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:19:08
How'd you generate your reports, if you don't mind me asking? I'm looking for something I can copy-paste my gdax trade history into, because I switch between cryptocurrencies often and it makes things a little confusing.

I wish the US would follow suit. :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:40
My argument otherwise is everyone is expecting a drop to happen and my granddaddy always told me to always expect the unexpected. Proof right there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:31
Yeah it crashed from 800 to 400, and stayed there for 2 years. But it did rise again. Not like I needed that $800 for anything, I shoulda just kept it. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:54:16
Essentially the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:05:39
I know the situation I'm in :) a bit different than a fresh college graduate, but young nonetheless. Thanks for lookin out, bud!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:39:42
Yep! All in good fun while learning. I've spent a solid 8 years of my childhood day trading on a video game with a similar exchange, so the experience lends itself over to bitcoin very well. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:33:36

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:56:31
Jeez! Both of you are salty as hell. Hug it out man, you both will be okay. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:03
Not far. Gdax's connection is horrible right now. Plus people buying in at 9,500 cuz 'cheap coinz'.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:49:43
Why the criticism? I sold at 11 and bought at 9. The timing was luck but the reason I sold and bought again is because I felt we were due for another dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:37:17
Looking back on it, it's kinda hard to read what exactly I did just by my trades alone. I felt like bitcoin might have been ready for another small correction, otherwise I would have made bigger profits by simply holding after I bought at 9150
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:28:44
Yeah except I couldn't sell because GDax is refusing to let me log in. Great!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:46:05
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:16:41
Lol damn, that came outta nowhere. Why don't you put your "intellectual dishonesty" to use elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:06
Risk management helps a lot by staggering your buys and sells. Plus, you can't win them all! Playing the exchange is much like playing Texas Hold'em - there's no way to win all the hands, but there's definitely a way to curve your odds over 50% chance of winning. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:44:01
Why not? Most people don't even know what crypto is, let alone wtf a hodl is.

Good points, actually. Thanks for bringing those to light. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:58:17
yay! im happy for ya :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:16:07
"almost no possibility of going to zero"
true. just like there's almost no possibility of bitcoin hitting 100M. 
I see what you're saying, but it's still safer to play bitcoin like a risky investment than a safe place to store your wealth. You have no idea what's in store for the future of Bitcoin... so to talk about it like it has "almost no possibility of going to zero" is a little overconfident and naive at best. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:24:50
Maybe bitcoin, in your opinion, is a safer store of wealth than banks and national currencies. But that's not the opinion of over 90% of the country / world. Most of the population has no idea what a cryptocurrency IS, let alone how it could exist and thrive. 
With bitcoin, something that's traded much like stocks, you have to make your judgements based off of what people perceive them to be, rather than what the number charts and graphs say. 
Here's a wild scenario. If Trump were to get over-emotional about cryptocurrencies one day and make a post on Twitter about how they're "fake" and a "scam", what do you think MOST people would think? Maybe it wouldn't kill bitcoin, but it'd definitely cause chaos. 
Mostly, it's just silly to me that the instant bitcoin hits $7k, everyone truly believes that it'll never crash ever again. Only "corrections" from here on boys!! WE'RE IN THIS TO THE TOP! WE'RE ALL GONNA BE MILLIONAIRES. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:21:36
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:16
Except it's not. Just lost about $1k from not being able to sell when I needed to. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:34
Makes me feel shitty... but in retrospect, you'd be deemed a fool for investing even half your funds into a volatile 'relatively unknown' "currency". What's next, feeling bad about not investing into penny stocks that skyrocket 10,000%? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:34:54
"Bitcoin is never going to stop increasing in value over the long term" 
So... you can predict long term future? Speaking of Yoda.
edit: this guy knows what he's talking about. sell your car, mortgage your house, withdraw your 401k, invest it all into BTC cuz this guy is 100% ~~delusional~~ positive that BTC will never drop in value over the long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:01:39
Can you gamble "safely" ever, regardless of currency? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:04:09
And yet, with the plethora of altcoins coming to rise and the still very volatile nature of cryptocurrencies in general, the financial security in bitcoin lessens. Especially when you consider that bitcoin skyrocketed from 1k to 7k in less than a year, yet the actual adoption rate and usage rate of bitcoin hasn't increased by nearly as much. What that means to me is that lots of people are purchasing, holding, and doing nothing else. 
For most holders, the most likely thing to happen is to cash out. Whether that be after a price crash, or a speculated "peak", it doesn't matter. Most people aren't planning on using cryptocurrencies as an actual currency until financial security is established... and financial security within cryptocurrencies will never be established until the price evens out. 
Until then... Play the currency like you're in Vegas, and don't expect to come out on top. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:59:18
A lucky one, yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:29:12


Because in his opinion, there's a greater potential profit in the meantime by switching his investments to Monero, while he waits for the crash in Bitcoin that he foresees coming. 
Nobody can see the future, so obviously he could be wrong. But if you think the lowest Bitcoin will hit is $7,100, then I think it's wise to start preparing emotionally. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:53:00
You should also take a look at all the videos where the 'autopilot' has failed. Teslas are not as advanced as they want you to believe... yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:20:46
No fees whatsoever, and as far as I know they don't expire. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:46:58
Same here. 18 years old, bought 1 bitcoin at $800 but ended up selling it for not much more. Fast forward to last week, I bought $500 worth of bitcoin at $7,100........ :| 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:02
Lol I was just about to cash out &amp; buy back in from 11k. GDax isn't letting me log in anymore though :|
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:18:40
Yeah from what I could tell you were just expanding on the previous user's comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:01
Yes, but I'm impatient and want to speed up my gains! Day trading is quite lucrative if you know how to do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:55:37
I know it's easy to, but don't beat yourself up over this... because there are a million other things that you could have (and arguably would have) spent those coins on before they skyrocketed. There is no way to tell the future, and it's unfair on yourself to feel bad over something you only realize in retrospect. 
PM me if you need someone to talk to.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:04
Would have, if gdax didn't crash at an inopportune time. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:14:47
If he's attending meetings with uphold, he can hop on the internet and do a couple searches. Not that hard, and evidently worth every penny. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:18
Wasn't trying to sell after the dip. I was happy at selling for $11,200 and I placed my offer on gdax right as it crashed. Offer didn't go through. Not the end of the world by any means, just a little aggravating that an external factor caused me to lose out on otherwise good timing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:22
You mean luck? Thats the bitcoin way
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:09
Not personally. I have an accountant who files my taxes for me. I think if you report capital gains, you should be fine. Someone correct me if I'm wrong though.

Still down for me
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:08:02
For cryptocurrencies as a whole, yes. Trouble is... which one? The future doesn't guarantee Bitcoin will be the all-reigning crypto for years/decades to come. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:02:32
I'd say day-trading BTC is much like playing Texas Holdem. It isn't possible to know what cards you're going to draw, but its definitely possible to curve your odds of winning over 50%.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:49
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:37:27
Not really. Made about $5k profits over the past month day trading.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:23:28
For emerging leaders, sometimes it's hard to put aside your own ego for sake of an argument. It's easy to fight fire with fire. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:41:43
Same here, bought at 7.1k... still waiting for my coins...
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:49:02
What, "lesson learned, sell it at peak next time"? But how do you know when the peaks are, if not for retrospect? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:28:29
Actually, there are quite* a few things that could happen that'll cause Bitcoin to decrease in value. Don't fool yourself.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:42:50
Few hours is fine. Just like driving without a seatbelt is probably fine for a few hours too. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:00:38
Exactly. $10 a hundred years ago is not valued the same as $10 today. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:29:49
This. If you are a part of the general public, then chances are you won't know when a lot of the major companies decide to switch to a different crypto. I believe cryptocurrencies as a whole will thrive, but there's no telling which. 
If you keep up-to-date for the most part, I'm sure that'll cover most of your bases. Just don't put all your eggs in one basket. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:10:46
Rounded up from 10.5k for the sake of making a point, but do you want me to screenshot the gdax trades? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:39:40
If you lose your key to your wallet, you can never get into it again. Although, if you have your key saved on a piece of paper or an external hard drive, you can install the wallet on a different computer and use your key to get your bitcoins from any computer as far as I'm aware.

It depends on how much cash you have, honestly. If $1k is your life savings, then its probably not good to invest all of it. But if $1k is a drop in the bucket, then you'll probably regret not putting in more once the price goes up. 
Price could crash though, nobody knows, so don't invest more than you're willing to lose.

The course record on bitcoin has been nothing but profit for the people who have kept it in their wallets. I bought mine at $1,000 per BTC, and it has still been a profit, even after the crash (or correction, for the people who prefer that word).
Rationally, based off of Bitcoin's track record among other things, investing in Bitcoin now and saving it for the future *is* a rational decision, if you only invest what you can afford. 
Ideally, this means having the money to pay for debts a few months in advance, having emergency funds, and having a little extra cushion to spend on yourself. THEN, you can invest any extra funds you have into bitcoin and not be hurt in the slightest if it drops.

It's okay, my PayPal locked with $800 for fraud, when I was the victim of it. It can never be recovered. Only looked at. Yay, $800 in pixels on a screen!

Grocery shopping while hungry is also a bad idea.
Either way, you lose your paycheck.

This is true. I unfortunately bought .45 bitcoins at $1,050, but once it hits a stable low, I'll buy some more and just sell the ones I buy later on. 
Until it reaches over $1,000, then I'll be able to sell all of mine for no loss.

Ah, okay. I can imagine that. I was under the impression that OP was only getting 0's on a few English papers, which at the very most would mean he'd just be failing 8th grade English.

I'm not sure where else to buy, honestly. I'm very new to bitcoin, and just recently created a Coinbase account. Hopefully Google is my friend

I agree that the article was written very well, though I don't agree with when they said that Bitcoin was difficult to purchase with USD.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:51:14
Exactly. Just like gambling -- set aside $100 that you don't care about losing. If you win big and bump it to $1,500, awesome for you!! If you lose it, or even lose it after winning $1,500, then you've only lost $100 net. No big deal.

The first thing I learned in my economics class was this: don't invest in something because someone else told you to do so. Only invest in something that *you* want to invest in, *after* you completely understand what you're investing in. 
It is not OP's fault if people buy bitcoin because of this reddit thread. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:24:30
I don't know why you would lawyer up just to get the grade on an 8th grade paper changed...

I've heard that Coinbase essentially buys your bitcoins for you, rather than having an inventory of them to sell. That might explain why it's taking such a long time. 
Unfortunate that you have to wait for it to clear before buying more though :(

Texting is pretty unorganized and informal, in my opinion 
I use email every day within my friend group. Easy for sending links to articles and sending pictures in an archive-able fashion. Also, I use email 24/7 for my job.

All the major investors are pulling out their money, causing an even bigger crash. 
Then, once it hits a low, whether it be $500 or $50, they'll all buy again because it's so cheap, causing a huge price rise back "to the moon". 
Just my speculation
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:15:08
I'm curious... does 8th grade really affect getting into college? I mean, as long as you don't get straight F's, I thought nothing really mattered until highschool. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:14:47
Circlejerking is only an *expression*.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:10:55
I understand that, and I can even see the reasoning (and benefit) of him contacting the principal. 
But getting a lawyer to change a grade of something that only affects you personally, as 8th grade doesn't affect your college choices as far as I'm aware, is quite silly. 
Of course, the lawyer thing was all hypothetical in the first place. But still.

I bought at $1,025. I'm excited.

Well, then I guess when I travelled abroad, all the signs on shop windows that said "USD Accepted!" were lying. After all, they just convert the USD to their own currency immediately after the purchase.

That is true, now that you put more context into it. Very easy to buy with Coinbase, and still easy albeit less so with Mt Gox, but definitely not as simple as walking up to an ATM and buying some.
