And Bitcoin is rallying today in response. Whatever they are doing they can keep doing it if this is the response.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:02:48
can confirm in same boat....I buy tops and sell bottoms!
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:27:55
So sick of everyone panic selling every 20 seconds. Either get out or get in, stop fucking about.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:16:54
thank God. Its nice to have some downtime after the past week.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:52:18
i sold the bottom!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:00:10
Move to Gdax and trade there
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:26
The steady hand prevailed. I was getting twitchy this morning but I held strong. Its all fun though.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:48:19
exactly, a month ago everyone was excited to see if we could get 10k bitcoin by end of year. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:42:58
its dropped to between 13-13,500k on at least 12 occasions this month and then bounces back. 13K seems to be the resistance level.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:05:31
.....and we are back in it!
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:23:50
Bitmain selling the last of their Bitcoin to try prop up Bcash!
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:27:43
On the back of this is it not a case that if everyone wants their bitcoin back instead of cash then the Mt Gox guy will have to rebuy all the Bitcoin he already sold or am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:35:06
I know so many people that entered in the past year and they would never go back after getting rekkt. Bitcoin is done with joe public. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:35:24
he panicked, he needed $400 million to pay the creditors, price was dropping and so he just dumped 18k bitcoins at 6k to get there. This guy is just someone hired by the court to sell bitcoin, he doesn't care about the market as long as he got his $400m.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:40:36
Jesus, just tank already so we can get going again. Frustration levels 1000%
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:06:35
I wouldn't mind this run slowing down a little. Slow and steady wins the race.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:37:17
how are there people still left to panic. Surely the weak hands have gone by now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:38:23
I think he's the Mt. Gox guy.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:14:14
lasted 24 hours until a friend told me the price.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:51:24
those Wall Street bonuses and end of China New Year!
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:27:54
Same here, my first time looking at it in about 2 months. Same old shit though. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:00:08
thanks to all the people that are giving up selling for Lent.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:49:52
I play the same game. Im a master at selling bottoms and buying tops.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:11:43
almost there
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:12:08
Thai Lopez and John McAfee.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:42:04
Financial freedom they said....yea, Im now free of all my finances. Im REKKT!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:48:59
ha, it started about 20 seconds after I sold, been fighting it all day. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:07:27
Most people I know that were on the sidelines waiting for months to get in or had sold weeks ago and were waiting it out all bought in yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:32:01
yes, happened to me twice. Both times I sold at a bottom and the price rebounded by 2-3k withing seconds of my sells. I bought back in both times losing a big percentage of my stack. Had I held Id still be up now. I learned my lesson and I am holding now to either zero or the moon......right now its looking like zero.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:36:06
I was on lunch over christmas and the table beside me were having a conversation about how their team in work stopped pooling their money to play the lottery every week and instead pooled the same money and were investing in bitcoin. Thats when I knew a crash was coming.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:03:05
Chinese New Year
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:31:56
The Asians will just take all that later tonight and we will be heading for 6500 tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:09:14
No longer screaming for Lambos, Ill take a Lada at this stage!
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:22:36
Its all relative......there have been several mountains on the bitcoin charts over the years. This mountain will be insignificant in a few years, just like the others.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:43:54
yesterday lunchtime there was a pump of the exact same amount and it dumped about 3 hours later. This is the same whale. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:17:51
Sell it and buy lottery tickets.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:26:08
I think Expedia accept it, or did. Probably wouldn't wipe their ass with it now. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:36:26
lets just retest 10k there real quick!
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:14:18
I still haven't seen this "bubble" you speak of. The price is where it was 2 months ago. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:36:21
too many people in crypto have invested money they cant afford to lose so cash out to protect their money at any signs or news that mentions crypto in a negative way. Its unfortunate but thats what happens in an emerging speculative market.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:44:37
Wall Street finally got those bonuses!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:38:52
There is a cafe on Aungier Street called Crypto Cafe which has a Coinbase screen updating customers on currency prices, and signs on the wall proclaiming “Hodl 4 Life”. I also know of a couple of other places around Dublin accepting crypto payments. We have to start somewhere.
I also believe Irish mobile usage is the largest in the western world and per population we have more Playstations in the world bar Japan. We like our technology.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:38:45
back in the game!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:47:54
We need Thai Lopez to invest those big bucks and be all our saviours now
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:37:29
what if you trade daily
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:39:32
so that they get tax payments from people that may not pay them in the first place.....for starters. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:08:26
Chinese new year has already been factored into price. Those guys historically sell 2 weeks before.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:34:14
There is the 4.30pm European sell off. Like clockwork every day.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:43:34
riding this baby to zero
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:03:03
Buy the rumour sell the news.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:31:11
Futures end on the 14th, Chinese New Year 16th....think people just being cautious and cashing out.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:05:01
Im one. Second time now I have sold the dip. This time though I just cant bring myself to buy back in at a loss. Both times my stop losses hit overnight literally at the bottom before bouncing back within seconds. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:29:37
Today is pancake Tuesday. People gotta eat.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:40:39
tried it twice. Both times missed the bottom by inches. Price shot back up and I fomo'd back in at a loss.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:14:20
please go back to 7500.....i need to buy my stack back
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:17:22
Done it twice myself....refusing to sell again this time. Im riding this shit to zero if needs be. I can afford to lose what I put in but lost about 30% of my stack selling the dips and buying back in when it looked bullish. Im not smart enough to trade the market and the stress of doing so is too much so ill be back in a couple of years to see if Im holding an empty bag carrier or can afford to buy a house!
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:56:25
he is still working on it. I saw a documentary recently where they showed the crafts being built. The already paid up customers being shown around, they hold monthly events for them to see the progress being made. It takes a long time to make a space ready craft that is safe to carry civilians. Branson was in the doc and said he thinks they will be taking their first passengers up within the year. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:21:42
The reasons given for rejecting today's ETF will not change in 2 weeks. The CBOE ETF will also be rejected for those same reasons. It may be a very long time before we see ETFs being granted.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:04:24
50k bitcoin by end of year they said! I am expecting this to be true.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:58:13
Almost everyone I know that had been on the sidelines for months waiting to get in all bought in yesterday. I hope thats a good sign.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:10:55
why not!......redditor logic. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:29:51
well yea, everything has to stop at zero.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:10:17
It seems no good news can move this market right now yet the first sniff of FUD and its panic stations to sell as quick as possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:22:44
see you at 6500 tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:47:12
buy now
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:59:49
$10 drop and my brain is just shouting constantly "sell, sell, sell, its over, sell".
 $10 rise and my brain is shouting constantly "moon, moon, moon, should have bought the dip, moon.
