I'm definitely going for the legal side of things, I like my US rights too much to become a felon. My issues with providing the information is mostly due to the tinfoil hat side of logic in regards to if the government decided to outlaw/limit/otherwise legally attack btc. The fact that they wouldn't have to work to find out that I have been using and hoarding it from today forward. I feel like it shouldn't be THAT easy for them :) 
Flip side, if I want to do any market exchanges, trades, or cash out (minus localbitcoins.com) I believe that is the only way in the US?

Opening the port is in the plan, after segregating it to a DMZ side of my Fortigate with no access to anything but the interwebs. As I have 0.00 btc, I haven't much to worry about at this time. =) I will be setting up another vm and light wallet to actually hold them in almost cold storage, disconnected from everything. Much appreciate the constructive comments.

Thanks for the appreciation of a nerds home setup haha! With networking, it definitely is not worth doing if its not done at least mostly right. Luckily my job provides lots of at home "extended testing" opportunities for enterprise grade hardware :) The thanks for running one was great, but my first btc... now that is fricken awesome! Thank you!

I really appreciate all your links and information on the topics. Being a first time on reddit as more than a visitor lurking and at the same time just getting committed into btc leaves a lot of information to ingest. Any and all helps.

I have and would rather do that to an extent. Only issue is that the cost of in person compared to bank deposit can be considerably more, and the nearest that I can find is 45 minutes to an hour away.

Firstly, thank you! Good question on the why now... Mostly I'm in a place financially that I can spend some money here and there without worry, but also because being an IT nerd I hate that I've never been a part of the bitcoin community. Always read up on it, said I would start it, and just never did. The whole enter all your information/bank/life story to purchase them in the US wasn't/isn't very comforting.
On the full client, it is going to be running 24/7 in my home datacenter and I'll be port forwarding for it to accept connections, so I figure if I can help out the network I might as well.

That is some seriously sound advice and if I do get into the exchanges I'll definitely be using it, thanks!

Being an IT guy for years makes the technical side easy, its just the financial side that is the unknown. Getting nodes, vlans, ports, etc. No biggie. 
But, say that I have to enter all my info into this website that equates to everything needed to steal my identity and have my bank account with it was/is rather unsettling.

I'll definitely have to look into it. Of course the number of wallets and available programs only keeps growing. What is it you prefer about armory?

Thank you! I've got the full wallet running on a VM in my home datacenter, so it will be connected 24/7, and will be backed up at multiple levels. Also, it is easy enough move the VM around between datastores or hosts in the cluster should I need to, and I can use it solely for bitcoin to avoid any malware or otherwise.

Thank you, there is seriously a lot of info here, hopefully the majority is good. Of course being the internet there's always the risk of off the wall comments, but usually they are shot down haha. 
Thank you for the bits as well! has officially taken the 0.00 off my wallet, but I'll gladly play with a few more transferring around and tipping while I try to get my first purchase put through.

Very good points. Getting the USD to BTC is the initial hold up of course. Then giving all the BTC to some third party to trust they won't MTGox you is a whole new can of worms. Of course, everyone has their own horror stories with each company that has anything to do with trades and such, and there are others that praise those same companies. Being new to the world of this, it is definitely difficult to read up on everything and say, "OK, I'll try and trust this company not to screw me."
Bitcoins to precious metal, that's pretty slick again assuming they in fact give you the precious metal after you give them the btc. Non-reversible and nothing to do but trust them... I clearly have trust issues, that much I know!

Thanks for the heads up, I'll look at that as a possible.

I was looking at using BoA to direct deposit into other's accounts for the purchase of bitcoins. I do not, nor plan, to have an account there. I haven't read any issues with using BoA for this purpose as the buyer, that's definitely not to say I haven't missed something and am always open to criticism/input especially considering my lack of experience with this.
