I would happen to agree with Mr. Wozniak. The limited number of BTC would be a good safeguard from depreciation in value.

Sign of the times. Crypto is the gold for the 21st century. However, I would personally advise people to diversify, personally I would invest in gold and cryptocurrencies. Then again I am far from an expert.

It certainly would be something if the value of bitcoin does hit 100k. That would really be something. There were plenty of skeptics in regards to it hitting 10k. So I would say never say never. I believe that is starting to gain steam as a feasible alternative to fiat currency.

It certainly is interesting to see the potential  evolution of currency. I would not underestimate bitcoin, it could very well make banks obsolete. I would keep an open mind.

Damn, this all makes me wish I got into bitcoin years ago.

The GIF does enough to signify how fruitless the attempts to regulate it have been. Bitcoin is a free market phenomena, it's success an be attributed to not having the meddling of unnecessary regulations. Especially when you note the failures of fiat currency.

Bitcoin is an example of what can be done when you allow the market to function with minimal government involvement.

Well it hit 10k prior to X-mas. I would suppose you could consider that an early Christmas present if you own any bitcoin.

This is some excellent information. 
Thank you.

Certainly is an excellent way to redirect your spending. Bitcoin is a risk, however, certainly a better risk to undertake than cigarettes.

Well ,if Bitcoin continues with its current momentum you may be laughing all the way to the bank. Personally, I am too risk adverse to attempt this.However, I would agree that it probably best to diversify investments.

Unfortunately it looks like it is well on it's way. So I hate to say it, a bet is bet.
