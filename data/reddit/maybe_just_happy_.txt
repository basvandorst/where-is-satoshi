Fair enough, that's the plan. I'm not only invested in crypto but I do have a bit of diverse investments throughout.. being said, it does make you think about the volatility. I'm in it for the product and will stay but these January dips aren't really necessary anymore - I know there's a lot of contractual things happening too that also affect now but the brunt of the blow came from the same thing it did last year and 4 years ago

How can their speculations and New year's have such a massive effect ?
I'm genuinely curious. I'm hodling, happily but I am at odds where to let my mind go. Furthermore, if a few individuals pull the chord, like literally 5-10, then the bottom falls out completely.
What can the community do to make it a stronger somewhat more stable market - as much as it could be of course? I mean the hands of a few should not determine all of our outcomes. Would it help if nearly everyone was a miner and validating  blockchain?

If this thing goes off the rails for a dive, buy the dip it will com back, again twice as strong. 
If it dips put 5k or 10k it will be at 40k this time next year at least

So sell now high and buy back in at the dip

Will the price drop?

I haven't been able to afford to invest since it was at 600-1200 :( 
...good luck to you all

I fully expect it to go up in the long run too but I'm getting out of stocks/etf for btc..feels safer to me

Ah, true true. 
I guess I meant to ask in terms of a bulk investment..what I consider bulk anyway like 5 or so btc then let it grow 
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:16:57
