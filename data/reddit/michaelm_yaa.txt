something i don't get about this though is FIAT does not fluctuate in price like bitcoin currently does?  
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:00:46
they will prolly update bitcoin so it's new and cooler.  like it will use new code or some shit!

buy orders are set while people are afk.

It's to get the reaction from chat and the streamer.   Also,  some people donate to make friends because they have none.

possible bounce up to 7700 and then down to 7300 .. maybe.. like.. I can't really see us going back to 8400 today after this just yet.. if ya know what I mean.     or maybe just sideways stupidness for a few days from 7500 to 7800.

i really hope you are correct.

think of it more of an online chat room with a video on the side.  some people just like to chat with the streamer or other people in the chat.

you used the wrong terms..

Bear market for months.     If bitcoin selltles at $2700 to $4000 for months without going lower i see that as a good sign that another insane run up to $20k is possible afterwards.   
Just think of this.  Bitcoin was $1000 same time last year.  If it settles at $3000 at the lowest later on this year its not that bad on the overall picture.
