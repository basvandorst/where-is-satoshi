You don't understand. This is what happens:
* Ron sent Sally 5 BTC, &lt;50% confirm.
* &gt;50% are saying that, no, Ron sent George 5 BTC (**Ron doesn't try to spend again, the greater half of the room just got together and decided to flasify the information**)
* Sally tries to spend the 5 BTC she got from Ron, except the majority of the network are saying that she never got it in the first place.
Double spending is not "Ron sent Sally BTC, then sent George the same BTC". Double spending is just the network deciding to change where BTC is sent. It's just called "double spending" because if you're making a transaction that relies on verification of the receipt of BTC, then Sally's client could very well say she received the BTC. But later, after the majority of the network says that, no, she never got it in the first place, it would disappear from her wallet (she doesn't send it anywhere, it just goes away). So if Ron ordered something from Sally and she shipped it because her wallet said she got the BTC, she's shit out of luck, because now the network said those were never her BTC to begin with.

You almost lost me there, too, because I'm of the opinion that government shouldn't have a say in marriage at all. Lo and behold, you state almost the exact opinion, except go further in acknowledging the fact that we're not quite in the political climate to enact such a change. So, I see where you're coming from and support you all the way.
If you ever go state level, know that you gained a few supporters from Lubbock today.

Yep, like the other guy said, works great on my Win8 machine.

This was my first time, with no knowledge of Pirateat40 or anything. My fault, of course. Just really disappointing.

If I remember correctly, 0.02 returned 0.025, 0.1 returned 0.12, and 0.25 returned 0.3. All tiers took about a week to a week and a half to process.

I was initially suspicious, but then I got complacent after the first few payouts. A true lesson in skepticism.

If you don't believe me, I can put a video up on YouTube. I have boot level encryption enabled on my Windows 8 Pro hard drive. Period. Fully supported or not, it's working.

I agree, not one of my smartest moment. I tried it a few times, always expecting to lose, but once the payouts came when they were scheduled, the distrust kind of just went away. I don't know if advocating is the right word, but I showed the proof that they payed out. It's funny, going back and reading what I wrote, I would've never invested more than a few mBTC with that mentality. The mind's tendency to get comfortable is a strange thing.

Ah, I see now. My apologies for misunderstanding. I have boot level encryption enabled on my Windows 8 partition. Not the whole drive. But since it's a small SSD, it's just one partition anyway.

Wow. Now, of course all responsibility is mine, but had I heard that before hand (in the BitcoinTalk thread or the various threads about MU), I would've been a lot more reluctant to get involved.

Care to elaborate? I've never heard the story.
