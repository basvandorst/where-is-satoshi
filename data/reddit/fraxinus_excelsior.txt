Big guys. Is small money for them.
Also know that some ppl cashed out at 1200 and are buying back in.
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:45:54
They maybe low now, but in a few years I will be very grateful.

It will be open source after beta if i'm not mistaken.

I know i'm a bit late to the party but i'm 22 since last month and still studying but on the side i'm investing some capital in BTC and learning more about investing and stocks.
What do you think of Benjamin Graham's book : The Intelligent Investor?

Apparently he does! Thank you kind stranger
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:25:45
To be honest, faucets can be really nice. If you have enough referrals you get btc for doing nothing.
I get my weekly payment of 0.0002-0.0003 BTC every week on monday without doing anything.

Awesome, he got that BTC from ppl here on reddit who gave him some for doing a presentation for his class.

Will i be able to watch later?
EDIT: seeing how the stream works on youtube and I can watch from start of conference I asume you can
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:48:11
Thank you in advance!
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:28:07
I wish i had more upvotes to give.
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:17:44
I would, but my uni isn't accepted :(

I couldn't just NOT upvote this.

Congratulations MAPS! Ive been a huge fan of your research and you overall stance and approuch of drugs. 
I really would like to donate but i think i should better hold my small amounts of BTC as a student, and leave the donating to the ppl who work, just wanted to say how much i appreciate what you guys do!
EDIT: Aaargh fuck it, will sell my Doge's and send you guys the BTC, don't spend it all in one place ;)
@_date: 2014-06-15 07:50:16
Do you accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:39:59
Proof of Stake, no mining required. 1% interest.
It was the first coin to implement this, its something BTC can never be.
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:13:49
Just tip small amounts then. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:15:50
Damn man, you made me giggle.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:12:30
Can i watch the video somewhere?
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:33:57
There were 2 buys where 2000 volume was created(1 at around 560 and 1 at 595 to boost above 600$). It was instant, so if you were watching you could see the sudden boost.

I don't know, does anyone know any other good unbiased documentary's of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-10 09:58:04
You are giving out reddit gold?
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:35:39
You are the one scamming. 
New account and just this post.
Don't fall for this people!

I missed the opportunity to explain myself in the survey. Maybe add a comment column?
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:02:01
Thats... really interesting.
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:49:09
Its not because a coin has a higher marketcap and trading volume that is better.
Look at ripple was number 2 coin, look where it is at.
Its the fundamentals that make a difference

There was not as much liquidity in the markets as we have now, so its not the same.

Nice, looking forward to seeing telefacts soon. Any idea when they are broadcasting the docu?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:03:12
Who says i'm laughing?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:54:09
