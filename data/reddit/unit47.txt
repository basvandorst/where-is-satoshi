This guy is saying: bitcoin is dead and he is looking forward to it, especially about the part when we start crying.
what a fucking asshole
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:01:52
confirmed as real
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:21:24
There is management and support. 
Support does not know anything.
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:36:54
Ok, I agree with you on that point. 
I just wanted to motivate people to think, to establish some logical thoughts. It frustrates me that they don't do it and fall into traps.

What i worried about is that they are going to introduce "Facecoin" which is not premined and every _member_ can mine it.
From a investor point of view that's the apocalypse for bitcoin or any other crypto. Your can keep your argument about centralization to yourself. Honestly that doesn't matter.

FULL ACK

The total crypto Marketcap is around 6.5 billion dollars. How is that going to threat the economy of a fucking country?.

No Verification No Withdraw!
Deposit is suspended!
If you are talking about less than 1k then go to casino or hire a midclass hooker.

ok let me do the brain work for you. 
- SarahCoinBit is just a low level support.
- Jonathan Waller can't give the source of that graphic.
- Only a few ppl have access to this sensitive material who are not willing to share it with you!
- Gox is losing money because of the well-known problem*.
- Roger Ver (cunt) edited his youtube vid, that he does not explicit mention that gox is solvent.
- I can make that graphic ...
I can give you more reasons but i have better and more important things to do right now.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:55:03
But I do get your attention ;-) You've lot to learn
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:49:28
I told you about Roger Ver days before, but its ok! Your money, your problem :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:44:40
where the fuck you get that information
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:35:07
Current situation is not funny, not a single bit! Do you have idea how serious this is? It has a great impact on crypto. All business with crypto is kinda on hold.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:29:40
What kind of question are you supposed to ask him?
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:39:02
SarahCoinBit does not know shit. This graphic is shit. I'm not going to explain why. Use your brain
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:42:26
Would you please at least publish that document? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:18:00
Why would BTC make a joint-statement then?
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:56:35
Ahaha ;-) 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:13:50
He is buying himself more time to escape and all the news-sites help him spread his FUD
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:34:02
If your attention is to drop the current pirce of BTC with your panic message. You may succeed, but what make you so sure that BTC will go up ever again?
You know Mark from MtGox. Now look how that goes.
