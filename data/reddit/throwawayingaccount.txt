That seems an awful lot like being forced to testify against yourself.

As I see it, there are three distinct stages that you'll need to know about.  The first two, you'll need to explain to the customer.  THe last one, they won't need to worry about.
Step 1)  Let the customer acquire bitcoins, and have these bitcoins enter the customer's wallet.
Step 2)  The customer transfers bitcoins to you.
Step 3)  You convert the bitcoins to a currency of your choice.  (or hold onto them, your choice)
There are many ways to acquire bitcoins, but most people that need help with bitcoin will be exchanging their local currency for bitcoin.  I am not very knowledgable about the inns and outs of the various methods of doing this.
For step 2) Once they have bitcoins in their wallet, you have to generate a bitcoin address for them to send the bitcoins to.  This is literally as simple as pressing a button.  You do not need to register the bitcoin address, or anything like that.  I would recommend generating a new bitcoin address for every customer, to avoid confusion.  Once the customer has been given a bitcoin address to send the bitcoins to, they simply go to the wallet application, input the bitcoin address, input the correct amount to send, and then hit send.
Wait 10 or so minutes for a block confirmation, and the coins are now securely in your wallet.
Step 3)  Now you have bitcoins.  Do stuff with them.  Hold onto em, buy stuff with em, give em away, convert em to USD.

I realize mining isn't worth the electricity it consumes, for me at least.
I'm just happy to have a space heater that also produces bitcoins.

That sounds like a TERRIBLE idea.  Splitting a coin that small is going to generate a LOT of fees.  Further, it shits on the idea that bitcoins are fungable.

This probably isn't the best way to show him how bitcoin works, as it adds steps that aren't actually part of the process.
Here is how it's SUPPOSED to go.
He creates an address.  He gives you an address.  You send coins to his address.  Wait for block confirmation.  Congratulations, the money is now his.
Here is how what you showed him goes.
You send a bot money.  You ask the bot to send him money.  The bot remembers this, and IF he asks the bot for money, he will have to create an account, and then the bot will send him money.
This is based on trusting the bot here, which is NOT required for bitcoin to work properly.  Bitcoin relies on trusting that most people are honest, rather than any one specific person.

Waitwhat?  HD-DVDs hold about 30 gig max, Blu-Ray hold 50 gigs max.
Sure, HD-DVDs had some good points, but they weren't objectively better.  (That said, I was rooting for HD-DVD)
