wallets are useless just deposit bitcoins to site you are using
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:25:01

@_date: 2017-10-29 18:55:15
uhhh im new to bitcoin what did you exactly mean by coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:09:45
dang so you dont need a wallet lol.Also why bitcoin is easily profitable i can make 100$ without doing anything
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:54:19
What you mean by gambling?
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:31:04
nah too risky
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:01:55
okay so as i understand you need a site to purchase/sell bitcoins and a wallet to deposit them.Say i use gdax to purchase and breadwallet to deposit.All im gonna do is wait to get bitcoin price to higher then sell? is this that simple or im missin somethin
