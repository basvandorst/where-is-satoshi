I thought nodes were a free service? I didn’t see anything about getting a cut when I set one up.

I will be stressed if it drops below 10k. Thats kind of the area bitcoin was at before this explosion.

Coinbase represents a small fraction of the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:48:15
ugh.. that is irrelevant now. Bitcoin is entering bear market for a while.
This will be 8.5k in the next 24-48hrs. Then hopefully we stabilize 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:14
Isn't BCH still up? How did you lose anything, hasnt crashed yet

RemindMe! 2 weeks "I told you so"
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:48
Correction to 9-12k I think. Dropping below 9k would suck as that was strong support 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:40
Is that even legal? wtf
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:21
Some people bought at 9k.. ouch.
Bitcoin flash sale ending

Do you have a target price?

I see a lot of people say this but why? I don't know much about this other bitcoin.

I was like "oh we will build support to 16k soon" nope...

Watch your reaction when it returns to $4k support for the next 6 months.

Doubt it. You must be one of those brain dead "hodl" people.

I cant find a halt code for it or resume time? Im not trading it, but on normal stocks I usually can find a code. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:20:28
I mine, have no control over this. How is it our fault? Literally just choose a coin with best algo and mine it lol
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:45:13
It went from nearly 20k to 10.5k... is that not a "drastic decrease?".
Pretty much returned back to where it was before the hyperbolic growth. Now just slowly building higher support.

Look at my reddit name 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:30:12
I see what you're saying nvm. I thought TX fees applied to all coins. 
I can only do Equihash and Lyra coins like Verticon and Zcash because SHA isnt profitable on 1080ti's
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:26
Seems normal... Contacting them would do nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:59
thanks that makes sense. Just thought the symbol would be bch not btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:15
I really bileve in crypto which is partially why I have taken a lot of risk. I worry it will plummet and that I bought in to late. I could barely afford a few at 16k a piece... 
But I'm not 100% sure Bitcoin will be the one... people on said Bitcoin was going in a death spiral. I don't know why they're so negative to bitcoin there, but everyone here is so positive. and are the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:10
Yeah im in full panic. Its breaking all support levels, really bad. 
Still holding.. but shit.. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:35:56
Yeah if you can get it for less than $6k........
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:42
I don't remember video looking that shitty back then? wow
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:30:39
Is your space heater 747 even profitable? S5 wtf 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:48
Im slow today.. thanks haha.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:37
do you know the name of the exchange? Is it NYSE instead? I'm not sure how to look this up
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:00:27
BCH is a shittier version of LTC
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:10:04
A small rebound that cant hold for 48hrs means nothing. 
A roller coaster doesn't go straight down forever, little bumps along the way. Sorry you bought at 19k

I mine with mining pool hub
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:54
Yeah I hate seeing 15k... sucks 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:31:36
That’s a bit extreme... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:20:15
I bought/mined bitcoin in middle school. Spent several BTC on a phone case.
I will never forgive myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:10:37
It will go back up.
Just tired of the "25k by EOY" posts. Not happening 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:32:36
The mempool issue is a problem. But will be fixed eventually 
Next run up will be 40k watch.. It could be in a few weeks,months or years. But 20k was not the all time high of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:10:33
I hate coinbase... But they aren't that dumb.
Doubt this is true

We already passed the "bull trap" on 12/17 if you want to use that model.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:44:52
Most of them left with the 10k drop.. stop being so dramatic.

You need to wait for the next batch of S9s. Getting it 2nd hand is like 2-3x more expensive. 
Also take proper precautions.. the risk of fire is high if you don’t load everything correctly.

never got a password for blockchain just identifier... I only put 50 cents anyway. Wonder how much that was worth...
 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:58:45
No it’s not worth it. I only get $7-8 a day with a desktop GTX 1080ti per card. So I’d imagine a mobile 1060 won’t mine much. Maybe $1 a day at most..
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:58
Did bitcoin just jump $2k in 1min? wtf

So why did bitcoin drop $1k following CME futures? 
I know zooming out this is nothing significant. But I don’t understand what triggered this. Thought we would be at 20k today 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:53
It was TPU lol....
