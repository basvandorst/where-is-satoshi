Protip: Don't publicly mention how much you own.

This was my thought too.

They are actually running the code themselves to experiment with it in order to gain understanding.

Bitfinex'ed is accepting donations for his legal defense against Bitfinex and Tether: 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:12:23
Now that he owns a significant amount of bitcoin, he would be crazy not to promote it on CNBC.

I am comparing to gold which is a store of value. You are comparing to the entire value transaction system, which at this moment Bitcoin cannot replace. Bitcoin will incorporate that in layer 2 via the Lightning Network (LN). And those transactions only require mining for settlement in the blockchain. The energy cost per transaction will therefore decrease drastically with LN.

You must be joking right? If you don't control your keys you don't actually own your bitcoin.

There don't need to be more miners. You can run the network with a few simple machines. The difficulty adjusts based on the total hashpower in the network. By itself hash power is likely to increase as the price of the coin goes up, as long as mining rewards and fees in bitcoin are worth more than the risks and expenses of a mining operation. This is the beauty of the system: it ensures that the security of the network will increase as its total value increases, in an organic way.

- Energetic footprint --&gt; actually it is very low for a decentralised reserve store of value. Gold/financial system use much, much more.
- High fees --&gt; This is due to exchanges failing to implement SegWit
- Code updates are slow --&gt; That is by design, safeguarding the network. Also the base layer protocol won't need that much work. That's what extra layers are for (e.g. Lightning).

Probably delayed. Would benefit shorters when futures come out.

Contact this user to find out if they found out which wallet was used to generate/recover that seed:

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:10:42
No. It's built on top of the SegWit ready protocol which is already activated.

You will be fine with Coinbase/GDAX/Bitstamp/Kraken (the latter only if you don't mind error messages and a lottery to determine if your order actually goes through). Just watch out for the (shady) altcoin exchanges.

"BTC was trading over $13k in zimbabwe"
That's actually incorrect. 2 years ago the government of Zimbabwe replaced their hyperinflated currency with bonds, promising those were backed 1-to-1 by USDs in reserve. This promise was not kept (surprise, surprise), as they kept printing those bonds and now they are exchanged for much less than the 1 USD peg. This virtually increases the price of bitcoin there to a higher USD amount, but these are not actual dollars being traded.

This is a legimitate request from Ledger. Feel free to verify my flair and post history on the sub.
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:32:05
The Ledger Nano X builds on the Ledger Nano S while keeping the same security model. The hardware architecture of the Ledger Nano X is improved so that the screen and buttons are directly connected to the Secure Element.

Please learn about BIP32 / BIP39. Thanks
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:13:28
This is simply untrue. Ledger does not store any backup of your private keys. You can do the process fully offline, that should be proof enough. :)
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:16:08
Hello, I work at Ledger's tech support department and I confirm that no backups are created of the private keys. Even if your device is not connected to the internet, it will be able to restore the private keys from your recovery phrase. If you'd like to learn more there's some interesting maths and cryptography involved.

Pathetic to migrate for money alone.

Yeah, I thought about putting it on the screen but the 'Don't panic' fits so nicely with the crash that I wanted to put the chart behind the steering wheel.

Just entering three false PIN codes will reset the device.

Everyone has their own time horizon. For some 10 years, for others 40 years. People have different stories and needs. You can hold some of your bitcoin until you die, passing it on to your relatives, and sell the rest when you can afford life-changing goods/services from it. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:58:36
Thanks! Haven't gotten around to setting my Lightning node up yet.

And how would you suggest we get to it becoming a method of payment if its value doesn't stabilize first by many many people hodling it.
