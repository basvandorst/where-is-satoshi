Right, people got rich off of Apple and Microsoft but at first they seemed like silly overpriced toys if you weren't an accountant. 
Or who would have thought that an internet search company that didn't even put banner ads on its front page would be a big deal?
On the flip side, there are people who invested a lot in comic books in the 90s, or beanie babies and those never went up again.

In all seriousness it depends on your age and the size. A young person with $1 million or less should put it in a low risk investment like index funds until they are ready to buy a house. Someone older should pay off their house and other debt then put the rest in bonds or index funds. A larger inheritance you can take risk with parts of it and put the rest in safe investments.

Yeah, buying a house you're going to live in is a good deal. Even if bitcoin continues to rise, if you've bought that house outright you're "earning" whatever your rent/mortgage would have been. While having your principle protected and insured. 
Plus, you don't have to worry about your house getting hacked and stolen, or losing the wallet you kept your house in.

Yeah, I know I would have sold it when it went to $100 if not earlier. And if I held on to any of it, I definitely would have sold that at $1000. So I can't really be upset that I thought it was an interesting idea that would never take off when I first heard about it.

It wasn't so bad for AOL investors. Ideally they would have sold in 2000, but if they didn't they ended up with stock in the merged AOL-Time Warner. AOL shareholders ended up with 55% of the combined company, so in reality it was an acquisition of a profitable company (TW) by an inflated company with no long term prospects (AOL). AOL was then spun off 9 years later.

Otoh, a lot of banks give bonuses to new customers.

That's true, I was just talking about recent times.

Yeah, this sort of thing happens to pretty much anyone who invests at some point. I've had stocks that if I had held would be worth a ton more now. Or if you bought a house at the right time and sold it in 2008 or so you could make hundreds of thousands.

They same way they did when gold and silver was money and banknotes were backed by deposits the banks didn't actually have on hand.

Yeah, I've got a mortgage plus investments and a 401k. The interest rate on my mortgage is so low that I get a better return by not paying down the mortgage more than I have to while investing the extra cash in my 401k. It's like a 5% difference. If I was given money to pay off my mortgage, I'd invest it instead.

You can buy gold and silver bullion on ebay. Usually it is excluded from earning ebay bucks though. There are also precious medal ETFs you can invest in, though they might just be companies involved in production. 
You can also invest in real estate via REITs, if you don't have the capital to do it directly. 
You can actually do all three now on your phone with something like SoFi.

People will blame Bitcoin when that happens.

Brexit is the most likely thing to cause a recession, though it is possible that the US could be boosted by that and the EU and China hit harder.

You can buy either individual stocks, or buy funds. With funds you basically own a part of that fund (your shares), and the fund owns other things. What the fund owns can vary depending on their strategy (which the description of the fund will tell you). There are real estate funds, stock funds, bond funds, etc. Stock funds usually focus on something. There can be one that focuses on the S&amp;P 500 like you mention, or large international companies, or healtcare, or energy. 
Funds lower the risk because any gains or losses are spread out across multiple assets owned by the funds. If you own Apple stock, maybe it goes up or down but your risk is entirely in how Apple does. If you own a technology stock fund then Apple is a part of that along with Google, IBM, Cisco, etc. Lower risk but lower potential reward. 
Funds are also hands off for you -- you don't have to worry about tracking stocks, trading, etc. A fund manager handles all of that, for a fee (a small percentage of the fund).

The main complaint about it seems to be that it is stopping people from taking out other debt, like mortgages and car loans...

When coins were linked to precious metals, fluctuations in supply could have a big impact on purchasing power. Also, bimetallism (using both gold and silver in currency) means that the exchange rate between the two comes into play. OTOH, it makes international trade very easy since every country's currency is basically backed by the same things. 
During  the 19th century there was a lot of financial problems due to the discovery of various gold and silver mines around the world, especially in the US West. There's a lot of symbolism around it in The Wizard of Oz, though that is mostly lost on readers now. There was a famous speech about it in the 1896 election: [
As a side note, if the US had adopted a silver standard instead of a gold standard, it's possible the Great Depression would have been less harsh. Countries on a silver standard, such as China and Japan avoided it almost entirely.

Still better than me when I heard about it back then and thought it was an interesting idea that no one would ever buy into.

Pre 1980s cents are worth more than their face value. Pre 1964 silver coins are worth a lot more.

At some point you never sell because there's nothing to sell it for. You just buy what you want directly. Talking about selling your bitcoin will confuse people the same as if you said today you're going to sell your dollars for some metal bullion.

Nah, gold is pretty soft. Steel alloy coins with a high chromium content are probably the hardest money.

If they make specialized cards that are superior for mining then it could take some pressure off gaming tailored cards.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:48:33
Their FAQ says that you can transfer coins out, but not deposit them in: 
So it sounds like as long as you are keeping them in Robinhood they're holding the coins but you can send them to your own wallet if you want. But you're responsible for any network fees. 
Which makes them a good way to buy coins, but not to convert them back to fiat unless you keep them in Robinhood the whole time.

I don't think so, they've been hacked a couple times since. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:22:43
It depends on when they bought and how long before they corrected their mistake -- the value of BCH has fallen faster than BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:33:32
That's true.... Kinda sucks for people who waited to convert to USD for taxes...
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:47:27
Yeah... I think a lot of the price drop right now is due to anxiety about regulatory uncertainty in the US and other wealthy countries, plus people spooked because they thought the huge spike in price in December was normal. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:24:07
They'll just do a Wells Fargo and keep opening fake accounts.

Thee card makers have to be careful. They don't want to over produce and then be left with a massive amount of production they can't sell if crypto prices tank and mining drops off. But they also don't want prices so high that they alienate their long term customer base of gamers. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:50:59
Yeah, they store the USD in custodial banks. If you're a US resident they're FDIC insured up to $250,000. So if they went bankrupt the cash would be yours, and not claimable by creditors.

It's one guy pretty much writing all the articles for them:

It basically doubled in price from 2015 to 2016 and again from 2016 to 2017, then shot up 20x in 2017. But mostly in the second half of the year. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:45:09
It would reduce your taxable income, and generally can be spread across years if it is large.

Yes, but keep in mind FDIC wouldn't cover a loss due to hacking.

French and German banks would be the weak point. It would be easy to stop people from buying/selling Libra for Euros within France and Germany. Which would drop adoption way down to only those people really determined to use it -- and those sorts of people would be better using Bitcoin anyway.

That's pretty much how it's treated by the US government. Every time you buy something with crypto you have to work out your capital gains. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:05:34
They'd have to block the use of Whatsapp and Messenger and the standalone app within their borders at the very least. Easiest for them is probably stopping banks and credit cards from working with sites that let you convert between Euros and Libra.

If you live in the US, sure they can. Unless you're evading taxes. But you can do that with fiat too. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:34:33
True, though if you mine you need to report it at the time you receive it.
