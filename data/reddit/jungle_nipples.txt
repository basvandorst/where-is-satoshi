Right, WoW money can't be used in the way you described above, but currently neither can bitcoin. With changes to WoW money it is just as likely to be usable in that fashion, if that were the goal.

I disagree with the fact that the government could turn the law against it and it would be the end of it. What you're talking about is essentially like outlawing encryption. Making things illegal has never stopped people from doing what they want.

Aw, come on now that's malarky. The network is the internet.
You're trying to tell me the value isn't in the bitcoins themselves(which are the product of computational time) but in the network they're sent over?
Your analogy makes no sense.

I understand the blockchain and history being distributed. That makes perfect sense. The distributed nature provides transaction transparency(and security), but that doesn't make it different from WoW Gold other than the fact that no controlling entity is capable of producing from thin air, which of course is a good thing.
To me, it's still based entirely on speculation of perceived value. You don't have to trust an exchange, or a banking entity- but you do have to trust the community as a whole in that the perceived value will continue.
Anyway, Thanks for the response(s)!

Forgive my ignorance. I understand that it is decentralized, but how does that really make it differ from any other currency based primarily on speculation?

But I generally don't see people hoarding USD expecting the value to increase. That's the fundamental difference I see BTC as, which is more akin to gambling.
