You are wrong about my math being wrong.

That's a bold one. I like it. The narrative can get a little messy if people realize that our UASF (BIP148) is actually compatible with MASF, i.e. BIP148 still allows early activation at any time by 95% of the miners. It also allows SegWit2x to activate SegWit with 80% before our flag date. That's what we call a MASF also. But if we can get rid of the MASF possibility it would be so much more awesome. I hope you have a good idea how to convince the plebs.
A UASF without MASF would be like a pure chainsplit play without the risk of actually safely activating with only one chain. We could add a condition that early activation happens at like 45% lol. Chainsplit every time! Lol! What more can we dream of?

I'm proud of that website, especially the BitcoinCore logo. Looks like the real deal!


LOL! Nice.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:29:30
Right! Activating with the miners still on is not interesting! I want some action. Some chainsplits! Some fucking pump and dumps! We can pump and dump shit so hard that it fucking bleeds! We want some blood on the streets! Drama! Nothing like some all-in bets from suckers. People losing their shirts! And we want war! MOAR!

Oh, come on, only scum that needs to be ripped off gets ripped off.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:51:26


Kinda yeah! BIP148 also overthrows the Core team! We don't like talking about it much, but it's the truth. It's a software provided by a different set (practically only one, actually, Luke) of programmers. We become the masters of the Bitcoin universe in the off chance that BIP148 activates *and* wins over the other chain. Good extra scenario for us, although I'd much more enjoy playing the scenario of a chainsplit now.
But we win something in every scenario that people run BIP148. It's all about the strategy ;) ;)






Lol! Mining is for plebs. Awesome people like us do scams.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:11:36
It's not that hard to briefly pump an illiquid altcoin over a price level, but keeping it there is another story entirely. How do you plan to create the illusion that the price of BIP148coin is *permanently* higher than the price of Bitcoin?
If you are e.g. a miner of 10% of the total hashrate and there is currently 0% mining BIP148, you'd have to mine 100 blocks times 10 minutes times 10 = 1 week (average) before you have your first mining reward.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:24:21


That's a good one. Few would smell that anything could be going on. They'd just see the price move against them right as they transfer their coins to an exchange but before they can execute their trade. Then they will wonder why the trade didn't do so well. They'd be like, no way anyone could front run me when I use Tor and shit, and then not think that the transaction is broadcast by a client which fucking advertises itself as user agent BIP148 UASF on the network. Lol! Like nobody would guess from that what kind of person is behind that transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:24:42
I hope is honest and nice and tells me the real numbers. I'd also like to know their current balance. I'd be very happy to learn if they keep a significant amount of BTC in reserves. Please tell me the real numbers. Look at me. I'm such a honorable and honest person. Why wouldn't anyone tell me the truth?
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:12:22
Fuck the law. If there are people dumb enough to buy into BU, UASF, UAHF, etc. someone has to scam them. Might as well be us. They are practically begging for it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:02:11
Never been better!
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:31:43


That would be awesome. Chainsplit every time any miner buys into any fork idea, however ridiculous it may be. I only worry that they may learn too fast and stop activating any forks at all, and then we're back to pumping shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:02:06
I can see why. Apparently he was looking for public figures who seem to have some naivete or dishonesty (with self or with others). Ideally both easy to fool and good at convincing others. I can guarantee you that he would have had even better chances with Trace Mayor, Eric Lombrozo, Tone Vays, Rusty Russell, Amir Taaki and others. I should know from my BIP148 experience.

Nice. Good information on the screenshot. Just one thing I'm wondering now. Could you please share with me, roughly, on a monthly basis, how much revenue goes through those nodes, in BTC? You could tell me in a PM if you like. It's not your personal money anyway, it's company money, right ;) ;)
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:15:58


That's a good one. Implying that it is being damaged by not being changed. It just rots because of *not* being forked off. I should use that one some time.
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:07:52
Yeah, I see some value in that. While we are able to keep spewing shitty UASFs at the miners they'll keep forking off and losing their shirts. That should keep hashrate stagnant and there will be a lot of mining equipment being liquidated, suppressing its price. We can shitcoinify Bitcoin once again. I gotta make that into hats next! **Make Bitcoin a shitcoin again!**
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:46:24
Exactly, please have bitcoins on the nodes and let our nodes have a connection to yours so that we know exactly when you send your coins to the exchanges, so that we can frontrun you. This is how UASF works! And you better be a whale, otherwise it's not worth our time.
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:27:52
Meanwhile, identifying yourself in your fucking wallet software, which can be snooped by anyone, is totes fine guise. Just run the "special" full node or wallet that we're giving to you and make sure you are an "economic node" (i.e. have money to be scammed of).
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:50:12
You sound so convincing, I should hire you for the next scam. But first, I have a bitcoin address to ask you to send money to. Ask me in PM.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:57:05
But, but... I'm not paid! Can I beg for some bitcoins? I'll use it for a "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal", pinky swear.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:18:25


Really? Can you also go back to not helping scam people, or were you always into this kind of stuff? Not much at risk by pumping this or that, right, my friend?
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:20:30
BU is a fucking scamcoin. People, don't fall for the fork scam.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:13:54
But but... the flippening from BU to UASF! Or something.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:51:25
We are totally not begging now. The UASF scheme is doing just fine! It will pay off even without your donations, trust me!

Nice. Statist affinity scam. I like this! Scam the fucking American statists!
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:22:58


Thats because you are just a mark and we are the experts. We run this shit. You don't know what the goals are, and therefore you don't know which outcome really is success, and which is failure. I promise you that a split will be very profitable (for us, clearly not for you).
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:26:00


You are good at playing dumb. We will need more people like you for our scheme.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:19:18


Shh... those are CAMOUFLAGE hats! They totally make one instantly inconspicuous once donned. "Grassroots" and shit, you know.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:23:18
They are *the other tribe*, you know. There are separate astroturfing organizations for separate tribes.

"Activating a minority soft fork (same as HF for miners, worse for users) in less than 2 months from now with bad code on the table, highly critical code review, without testing, let alone debugging, with a 'fuck it, we're gonna do it live' release, with a consensus within an astroturfing organization is totes fine guys" - kekcoin
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:02:00
Almost. Actually, none. Turns out scamming exchanges is not as easy as scamming oneself.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:07:26
What about unprofitable astroturfing?

Then we should summon our Lord (no offense, luke-jr). Oh wait, he is here already? Did I miss the memo?
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:08:08


But definitely do what we on this sub tell you to do and run the BIPs we tell you to run, cause we are so much better than the other sub or 4chan (at scamming people, that is).
