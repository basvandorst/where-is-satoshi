Blockchain is the fundamental backbone of all decentralized cryptocurrencies. The point is to prevent a single server interface.

Okay, Thanks! I have to go now, but I want to look into full-node's and send a message later. Cheers!

Serious question, Are there corporations which own a huge BC market share? BC isn't regulated, but these sell offs seem to be random and sharp and rebound quickly. Usually a sell-off is brought on through negative news. Such as when China decided to ban BTC, we saw a sell off. But these are random and almost feel designed to drive the cost down and rebuy. IDK. I'm crazy.

I disagree. Ethereum's functionality and built in contracts makes it a wise investment. I'd argue that you can even make the argument that Ethereum&gt;BC
EDIT: But 99% are scams :D

Look, this sounds weird but can I add you as a friend so we can continue this later after I do more research? I'm obsessed with crypto-currencies. Not with investing, but for the type of things you said above. I know a bit about NodeJs and such, but not enough to form a counterargument. I think a well argued debate over time will help me learn more. I'm not hard headed, I am willing to be wrong for the sake of learning something new.

As of this moment BC is only down −11.64% over the week. Ethereum is down -2.7%, LC is down -22.2%. Doesn't it say something that Ether isn't following bitcoins path. Its not coupled with BC's gains and loss' like other alt coins. I think Ether will win, its pretty much made for applications. 
Edit: Put Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, fixed it

Maybe its the 'conspiracy nut' in me, but I smell market manipulation. I've read about some accusations of insider training recently, is this true?

Then don't invest. Do you know why investors exist? you invest in an idea for future profit. Not short term. It was a bubble, and it always was. Bubbles pop. Buy more or hodl
