It would be nice to have some kind of incentive for running a full node. 
I still do not understand this part: Why miners get incentives and the full node hosters do not?
No wonder full nodes are decreasing... :(

Good observation!
It is an positive position for sure

What is "Red Box"?
Never heard of it.
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:17:19
I wonder if he has any DDOS attacks protection enabled there.
With the "hate community" he created after the Mt.Gox fiasco it would be a good idea to have it ;)
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:19:07
Very good and simple explanation!
That anybody can understand!
@_date: 2014-09-19 20:44:10
Go get them!
IMO these prices will never be seen again.
Last chance!

It's nice to know the "Big Boys" want to promote BTC use!

We are at the end of the "Quantitaive Easing" started by the US Federal Reserve in 2009 to get out of the last financial crisis (biggest in history BTW).
The "druggy" world economy is at the peak of its "high" at this time and the dollar seems "strong" worldwide.
QE has been stopped now, and pretty soon the "addict" will finish its high and enter into a very nasty hangover.
I believe this will cause more financial crises in 2015 mainly in weak countries' economies, and the world will be at "square one" again.
Then what? Issue more paper money and do more QE? Fat chance... that would finish killing the "addict"
This is when people will awake and start transferring their remaining wealth into Crypto in an effort to salvage some of it.
Crisis will be the catalyst for BTC mass adoption. 
There are some crises gestating in weak world economies right now that could very well trigger during 2015. 
Then we will see bullish bubbles in BTC price that will easily surpass what we saw at the end of 2013. 
Hold your Bitcoins!

Crazy!

You can get an idea after watching this for a while:
@_date: 2018-10-07 02:59:57
Where can you get some?
Is there a website?

"always use a full node as your wallet when receiving bitcoin payments."
I love my Electrum wallet ;)
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:10:46
Nice! Bookmarked.
Keep up the good work

Start EARNING Bitcoin again!
Earning it is much better than buying it ;)
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:38:21
Somebody has to be buying all the BCash everybody is dumping... ;)
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:54:35
Gua hahaha ... Very good! :)

Bcash = A degraded copy of Bitcoin. Nothing to offer to users / tech.
It's just a pathetic monument to Roger Ver and Jihan Woo's power-hungry egos 
Sad to see the slow-pace hemorrhage of their resources.
We'll see how deep their pockets are.... 
I'm glad I was able to finally dump that sh.. last night.
Thanks for the free BTC guys! ;)
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:46:57
I'm turning on my old mining rigs to help with my "grain of sand".
It'll probably make a difference if everybody does the same.

This is a significant milestone as PayPal was conceived as a form of payment for Internet. And it is (was) the leader in this area.
And now Bitcoin is taking over.
Very exciting! ;)

It could have been in Jekyll Island better, that would have kept the tradition :) :)

Also important: Start EARNING Bitcoin. Accept Bitcoin for your services and goods.
 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:47:58
Great point! Thanks

I'm very satisfied to see that bitcoin.org is taking this initiative. NO2X!
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:46:57
Excellent and well though-out letter!
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:22:41
Bye Bye Bcash ... 
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:33:37
A reasonable argument.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:15:43
We are dumping BitPay and moving to use gourl.io
We do not want to end up with 2X coin when we only accept real BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:44:28
Do it
I turned on 40Gh of old hash power about a month ago.
Every bit helps ;)

One of the first Bitcoin books.
Very well documented.
Good read

CampBX have been selectively scamming for a long time.
I lost $3,000 USD to them way back in 2013.
I'm very surprised they have lasted for so long.
Beware.

That happened to me when my Xapo card was new.
It seems to be a problem when cards are new, after a while, charges start coming in normally.

BCC = Bitmain Crap Coin
I like that!
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:45:19
Good tip, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:29:07
Great news to get rid of Roger Ver !
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:47:19
UASF is the cause.
Segwit2x is just a way for miners to get to "the front of the parade" and try to save some face after all their dishonest behavior.

BCC = Bit Coin Crap
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:11:48
Good analysis.
There is a wide consensus on activating SegWit, at last, and thanks to the UASF initiative. Keep it on to the end!
But there is not a consensus at all on a hard fork. So the 2x part of the “NYC Agreement” is still to be seen if it will be supported by users or not.
The good thing about this is that SegWit will activate regardless and irreversibly …. and it marks the beginning of the end of “Miner Dictatorship” in the space.
Both events are great for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:45:38
Too bellicose.
Bitcoin does not need to use force to be adopted.
No thanks
