Interestingly, the account where GrounBEEFtaxi appears to have sent the BTC from the XBC project is listed here:
At the top of the page here is a big red warning which says:
Warning! this bitcoin address contains transactions which may be double spends. You should be extremely careful when trusting any transactions to or from this address.
For the record, I never sent him BTC, I've been trying to warn people on the XBC thread on BitcoinTalk about this guy! You should read it. The stuff he comes out with is scary! At one point, he's claiming that each XBC will be worth 500BTC each, (because there are only 56,000XBC and 21,000,000BTC.
The current price of XBC is about 4 cents (it was originally about $15)!

Is this the same stupid logic that you used to tell people that each of your shitty BitcoinPlus (XBC)was going to be worth 500 BTC?
Now pay people back what you owe!

Your question is as nonsensical as the rest of the crap that you've been feeding everyone on the Bitcointalk forum.
On another note, are you going to be giving back the donated BTC that people gave you in good faith to use for the development of BitcoinPlus (XBC) as I notice that the wallet is now empty, yet nobody has received any funds back from you.

You're also a scammer who conned people out of BTC
Pay them back, you piece of shit!

Please can people tread carefully when dealing with GrounBEEFTaxi. As well as being a nonsensical Buffoon, he is a serial fantasist who has lost a lot of people money during his tenure as 'King Of Bitcoin Plus'.

It's a sort of guttural Neanderthal utterance like 'Ug'. GrounBEEFtaxi alternates between three different persona.
Firstly, there's Mr Chup. This version of GrounBEEFtaxi is a celebrity DJ in LA who spends his days in the studio 'laying down tracks'. Mr Chup is on Kanye's speed dial.
There's also 'The King Of XBC'. This is his guise as the lead developer of a failed altcoin. He is not a developer or a programmer in any way and he failed to do anything, despite talking the talk and telling people how he was going to make XBC more popular than Bitcoin. The King Of XBC is also a scammer who keeps funds that people have donated in good faith.
Then there's the real GrounBEEFtaxi, a guy who slices meat for a living and lives in his moms basement.
