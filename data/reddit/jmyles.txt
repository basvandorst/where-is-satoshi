It seems like the division is not so much between different political views, but different views about reality: Some people think that reality (or, at least in this case, economic pressure) is best understood as a mathematical force with roots in nature.
Others seem to think that power is more enduring, and that mathematics can be subverted or pushed aside if enough power is amassed.

There is plenty that sucks about Bitcoin: the increasingly centralized nature of mining is my biggest gripe - I think that long term, some problem besides SHA256 will win out.
Whom do you mean when you say "the developers?"  Yes, some developers regard it as a bug.  Some do not.  
What specific fix do you propose?  Are you sure it will not be more harmful than this so-called "bug?"

No.  They were not the first to bring the "problem" to the forefront.  The fact that peers in a P2P swarm can change unsigned data is not only well-known, but obvious.  The fact that this phenomenon can be used to modify a transaction hash has been known and discussed for more than two years.
The only thing that Mt Gox revealed is that multiple exchanges are using the ID of unconfirmed transactions in an inappropriate way.
I'm not even prepared to call this a bug and I'm not sure I am in support of "fixing" it.

@_date: 2014-02-10 17:18:14
Useful for saying, "Yep, I sent you the money, it's in transaction ABC123, confirmed 10 times."
I look at it this way: the ability of peers to modify data and pass it on is part of life in a peer to peer system.  Transactions are hashed to create an ID, so yeah, it's part of life that changing them will change the hash.  I don't see how this is a problem or even an inconvenience.  If you know the recipient's address, and both parties agree on it, then everybody just watches that address.
I'm concerned that changing transaction malleability will limit what can be done with blockchains in the future.  It may well be a feature; I don't see how it's a bug.
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:38:51
You are just completely misinformed about the current state of bittorrent.  Yes, it's true that there are uses that some governments regard as illegal.  However, there are many that aren't.  I don't know of a large list, although I'm sure they exist.
Miro is a great source for author-provided, syndicated bittorrent feeds.  
I personally download Democracy Now every day via Bit Torrent.  Do you think that Pacifica has the capacity to stream, in HD, to the millions of people around the world that watch Democracy Now?
It's true, as you say, that they have a website and that the majority of their consumer base chooses to consume the lower definition stream provided on the website.  However, for the (non-insignificant) number of individuals and public spaces that want to show it in HD, bittorrent is an ideal option.
Bittorrent is growing, and, although I don't think there are statistics on this matter, I surmise that completely legal uses of bittorrent are growing much faster than other uses.
Regardless, your first statement, "most people do not like bittorrent," is extraordinary.  Do you have evidence for this claim?

@_date: 2014-09-30 20:08:27
No.  This is absolutely untrue.  To which part of the "backbone" do you refer?  Routing?  Nameservice?  Transport?  Certificate authority?  All of these functions are possible by distributed mechanism; in each case, the distributed or federated form grows each day.  In short, there needn't be such a thing as "the internet backbone."

An ID is useful once it's in a block.  
Bitcoin isn't a tool to properly identify past actions in a bit torrent swarm.  It's a currency.  If you want to properly identify an action, use a signature, no?
I am prepared to admit that I may simply not fully understand the situation.  If that's the case, by all means direct to me resources wherein I may educate myself.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:27:17
Nodes can already ignore the DoS traffic by simply using inputs and outputs to characterize unconfirmed transactions.  Why do we even need a txid at all for unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:32:44
How can the txid ever be more reliable than looking at the I/O?
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:25:40
Sorry that the other guy called your question stupid.  However, it's an understandable reaction.
Bitcoin is not complicated, although it is complex.  In other words, you don't really need any pre-existing knowledge of the technologies to work out the protocol.
It takes most people a few days of learn-absorb-reflect cycle to get it.  Keep consuming beginner materials and you'll see.
Of course the number of numbers and the number of bitcoins have exactly nothing to do with one another.  The number of numbers is apparently decided by the physical nature of the universe, while the number of bitcoins is decided by consensus of a P2P swarm running the bitcoin client.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:31:41
People (including devs at MtGox) were using unconfirmed transaction IDs to audit transactions.  Of course you can't do this.
Now, people are calling for the protocol to be quickly changed so that MtGox's bad behavior will be OK.  Bizarre.
The sober among us are pointing out that the proper way to identify an unconfirmed transaction is by inputs and outputs.
I am hoping that this "flaw" is marked wontfix once and for all.
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:33:34
Revolutionary?  Just another blockchain.  I don't think it will be revolutionary.  We just need sub-chains that end in resolution to a single transaction on the main chain.  No news here.
But yes, of course you're right that Bitcoin is utterly unideal for micro in its current state.

Yeah, I've been wondering about that definition (which keeps coming up around here) as well.  Is there more context that changes the common-sense interpretation?

This is largely a myth.  
I've had MDMA three times and never experienced this.  Instead, I have experienced (especially in one case) happiness, understanding, empathy, and listening skills that have stayed with me for the years since.
edit: These are two different thoughts.  I wasn't saying that my experience disproves the largely mythological status of impairment-level neurotoxicity from MDMA use.  I was saying that (1) the neurotoxic effects of MDMA, including depression in the days after use, are incredibly overblown almost to the point of mythological status and that (2) I have had experiences which are contrary to this one specific effect.
Although I wish MDMA (and, for that matter, most psychoactives) were studied more, there is already pretty ample research on this matter.

I did not "bring bittorrent into this" - Satoshi did.  He called the technology a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."
Even if you don't like bittorrent (which is weird), why are you trying to rewrite history?

What an obtuse and intolerant response to a great question.  Fuck you.
Even if it's true now that many people don't have a good sense of the inner-workings of the technology in their lives, that doesn't mean it must be that way.  The dream of open source is that this problem can be transcended.  And Bitcoin is among the flagship products for which open source is a mission critical feature.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:35:09
It's not a bug.  A bug is behavior caused by accident or oversight.  This behavior is known and typical for P2P networks.  It is part of the design.
Furthermore, it only affects improper use.  The proper way to identify an unconfirmed transaction is by its inputs and outputs.  Those who do this are unaffected.
There is no reason to "fix" this "problem," and doing so may introduce more complications and hamper features down the road.

Your implicit surmise that the bus topology is the most efficient mode of transport is falsifiable by an easy example in the application layer:  The next time you sit down and use your favorite instant messaging client to talk to your next-door neighbor, ask why the TCP packet carrying your message had to go all the way to a server in Mountain View, CA (for Google Chat - of course other locations for other services).
Clearly the mesh topology is a more efficient physical layer for the needs of this particular application.
Now, to your point: Yes, of course the bus topology has it's place.  However, as many great minds of network topology have pointed out, a bus topology needn't imply centralized authority over things like, as you mention, DNS.
There's wonderful research and implementation happening in these fields right now!  For starters, go check out hyperboria.

This is an oversimplification, but not inaccurate.
It doesn't speak, however, to the specific question: Whose job is it to decide what will constitute legal tender?  Article 1, Section 10 of the US Constitution:


I'm not going to get into what the word "Tender" in this article (or "legal tender" in the title of this video) means, but you'll find that the bill in question explicitly uses the phrase "lawful money," not "legal tender," although the video explicitly (and improperly) conflates the two.

Well, there are people who have researched this matter extensively who believe that this is not, strictly speaking, the case.  Although it's elementary coverage of the topic only, I recommend Ron Paul's book "End the Fed" as an introduction.
tl;dr: When governments can print money by fiat, they pay for things that people don't want, starting with (and consisting mostly of) empire building.
Perhaps you don't believe that - fine.  However, don't try to turn it into a bumper-sticker contest or ask "what are you smoking."  This is a widely held belief, written about by respected economists for generations.

For deeper and more reusable functionality, you're right that it's excessive and counter-productive.
However, for people who are just beginning to adapt their mindset to the kind of logical expression required to instruct the machines in our will, we do need a "line by line" style of expression.  This is one of the reasons that the "higher level" languages have gained so much ground lately.
At the end of the day, it's not a ridiculous request.  At worst, it's a good learning opportunity.

Your concerns are well founded.
However, there is cause for optimism:  The "lock in" with a linux distribution is far, far higher than with a crytpo-currency.  In fact, for the purposes of currency (ie, the ways that people engage bitcoin other than mining and non-currency uses of the blockchain), they are all about the same.
It will be shockingly easy to switch out one crypto-currency for another at the retail and wholesale levels.
I expect that, as the liquidity pool grows, we'll see a proportional growth in agnosticism.  We'll see POS systems that accept dozens or hundreds of different types of crypto-currency, with the retail operator not even needing to know which blockchain is the domain of the transaction because it will be locked-in and traded in real-time with the crypto or fiat of their choice.
In short, you are right that we must be vigilant, but the crypto-currency realm is already a more friendly place to insurgency than the linux distribution realm.

As I said to the other commenter, that's exactly the point.  The term "coinbase" has a much more grave chance of being lost completely to the brand, thus forcing the community to come up with a new term for the generation transaction concept.  It's already difficult to search for it (ie, most forum posts and articles refer to the company, and there's no easy way to search these resources to filter these out).
If we have to retreat from this term, it renders part of the existing knowledge base (again, thinking about forum posts about coinbases and their use cases) unusable.  If we call it a "coinspawn" or something, we'll have to start an effectively new knowledge base across a bunch of media in order to discuss the concept.

I wasn't responding to a claim "that all gun owners are crazy" - you're right, nobody has claimed that.
I took gabblox's comment to mean that he / she "would feel not safe" living in an environment in which guns are freely available and frequently owned and carried because some n'er-do-wells can (and perhaps will) own and carry them.
Porcupine Festival is an interesting foil because you're surrounded by guns in a way that most people never have been (and I mean for serious - crazy heat being packed), and yet it feels much safer than everyday life.  Feeling the release of fear you never knew you had is very empowering.
Part of that fear, at least for me, is of the sort that gabblox expressed, so I think it's very relevant.  I'm generally a bit afraid of guns.  I've never owned one myself, and hadn't fired one until last year at Porc Fest.  So for me, to feel exactly the opposite of how I might have predicted was very awakening.

However, having a "line by line" understanding of the business logic of open source projects is a very natural desire, and one that I spend (and intend to continue spending) quite a bit of my time providing. 
If increasing openness (not just of the code, but of the cognitive basis - the true source) is not a crucial part of the vision, then I'm not even interested.

I guess there's two paths to tease out here:
1) On the definition of "conspiracy" - I just wanted to be clear that we're talking about people getting together to achieve (or inhibit) a particular result.  We aren't only talking about individuals acting on their own volition.  So naturally, we're talking about a conspiracy.  And that's reasonable and fine.
2) Whether or not the banks and the government care enough to conspire in the first place.  This is where I have uncertainty.  Bitcoin is pretty good.  It makes pretty good sense.  I don't see why the folks who have some power in the current broken, unpredictable, inefficient system really want it to stay this way.  I suspect that people who are positioned this way will prefer a better system, even if they have less power relative to other people.  These are the people who know better than anybody that there's enough to go around.
I surmise that the people running the federal reserve branches, for example, are pretty sick of the way things are going.  They'll be better off with Bitcoin (and crypto-autonomous intelligence) just like the rest of us.

At the risk of engaging in the same oversimplification that you are, the answer is roughly, "A government simply can't afford empire unless it can rely on being able to print money, control the printing of money, and manipulate the relationship between its own bond market and its central bank."  
To use your example, the US Government simply doesn't have enough Swiss francs to fund its wars, nor can it manipulate the borrowing configuration between it and the SNB.
That's a small, oversimplified answer.  If you want a real answer, you need to read.
...and again, I'm not trying to back this way of thinking (I haven't made up my mind yet), just make sure you understand that it's not some crackpot theory that the commenter above you made up.

There's no doubt that habitual, high-dosage use of MDMA causes a specific type of neurotoxicity - it's not merely "serotonin or dopamine withdrawal" but actual oxidative damage to serotonin transporters.  I'm not saying that's a myth.  However, even in this case, the available literature suggests that the effect is both preventable and 100% reversible.
What is a myth (and a cultural stereotype) is that everyone who takes MDMA becomes "happy" and then, a few days later, "becomes sad."

Is assignment of address space a 'huge class' of problem?  Even if you don't think that routing (and, for that matter, switching) in this distributed fashion is a game-changer, can we agree that address assignment needs to be done differently?  CJDNS and similar projects have a promising approach and it's not unfair to suggest that they might just solve this class of problem.


Fine.  However, "connected graph" isn't well-defined network terminology, although I agree that it better describes the transport layer of the internet.  However, the physical layer does look an awful lot like a bus - almost everyone is connected to a long, strung-out corporate-owned connection and cannot do packet switching with their neighbors absent the router at their ISP.


Agreed.  I'm not interested in running the "current internet" anyway, but even in my vision, I totally agree that long fiber cables, satellite connections, and yes, even "backbones" are part of a strong internet.
We can, however, distribute the responsibilities of routing, switching, and address space throughout our communities and ensure that, for example, urban areas with great density of connections have low-latency, high-bandwidth, energy efficient connections within them.

Bitcoin literally uses code, to conduct network activity, from bittorrent clients.  I'm not sure how much more "based on" you can get.

In terms of buying power, there's no doubt that USD is more stable.  I said it is a "non-trivial part of the problem," not that it is most of the problem.
For what it's worth, there have been a couple of runaway inflationary environments of fiat since the inception of bitcoin, and will probably be a few more every few years.  It's not unheard of or even abnormal.  Whether it will be your local currency is a matter of dependence on a great many variables.
On the other end of the spectrum from the retail big mac scenario, even the best established fiat currencies are quite volatile (though nowhere near as volatile as BTC, as you point out).  Against one another (or against oil or gold), every currency appears to fluctuate substantially.  
My point is that even the most eagle-eyed crypto currency design can't overcome that until and unless a crypto becomes a stabilizing world currency.

A non-trivial part of the problem is that fiat currencies are unstable, but appear stable due to the strange configuration of the economy.

Historically, this distinction is very important (although it hasn't always taken on terminology).  For all we know, history make look at on Bitcoin as an important moment in re-unifying "money" and "currency."
In any case, the answer is a sound one in light of OP's question.  Bitcoin isn't merely currency (an instrument of liquidity in trade), it is also money (a verifiably scare resource whose nature gives it utility).

I didn't mean to suggest that my own anecdote suggested that MDMA neurotoxicity generally (or this effect particular) are mythological.  These are two different thoughts.
The effect described - that MDMA makes a consumer happy at first and "Then sad again in a few days" is in fact almost entirely a myth.  It is not a well documented phenomenon.  Quite to the contrary, the best studies have shown and replicated long-term gains against depression, phobias, and PTSD.  MDMA has helped many people lead well-adjusted lives.
It is true that MDMA has been shown fairly conclusively to cause a specific type of toxicity to a specific type of neuron, but this effect can be moderated or, some studies suggest, completely eliminated through the application of specific antioxidants or SSRI's.  The SSRI approach obviously leaves something to be desired because not every serotonin transporter is affected, and those that aren't might suffer even more damage.
In any case, the point is that this blomstertjack's comment reflects a negative stereotype that the available literature suggests is fairly rare - far from the norm.

I am not an expert in finance or economics.  I am a capable programmer and have a BA in political science.
My sense is that the only factor that will truly define the value is acceptance among merchants.  As more merchants accept it, the price will go up.
Psychologically, there are three sub-factors:
1) Acceptance online makes bitcoin feel like a "native" currency of the internet.
2) Acceptance offline makes bitcoin feel like a competitor to the dollar.
3) Round exchange rates promote easy math, and thus compel a certain stubbornness around round price points that is probably not present with stocks.
On this basis, my sense is that there will be a great deal of fluctuation and correction (by correction I mean a return to a value consistent with mercantile exchange) but that bitcoin is headed for $1000 and will stay there for a while because people are going to want to easily trade things on the basis that 1 mBTC = $1.

They're two different processes with two different motivations.
Think of it this way:  Maybe you have 100BTC worth of investment capital - that's what you can affort to invest right now.
Then you have your liquid capital - the money that you earn as income and then use to pay bills and buy things.
You can keep the former as BTC indefinitely if you're long on crypto.  For the latter, however, you're going to use currency of some sort for almost all of your purchases (other than any bartering you might do).  So, for these, you can buy with USD - fine.  Or you can convert your USD to BTC and use that to buy because this process helps to increase the value of your investment.

...of, "Whether or not you have anything to hide, you can tell the world that the police searched your house.  Even if they tell you to keep it a secret."

A straightforward answer is, if this is true, "There's no quick, easy way to buy bitcoin online with the same level of anonymity as buying locally."  
This face (again, if it's true) is not obvious to most people. 
And obviously it's a huge pain point that you can't buy the internet currency.... on the internet.

You can purchase an iPhone case, but you can't purchase a phone to go in it that has a working bitcoin wallet.

Every challenge is technical.  Sometimes it's a matter of legal code, sometimes a matter of source code.

Wait, what?  I'm talking about an easy way to simply buy bitcoins online.  Yes, I have gone to localbitcoins.com and bitcointalk.org.
I was responding to your comment,


So I'm asking you, what other way is there to simply take my money and turn it into bitcoin?  If there really isn't one, then your question makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:49:28
I see.  I'm looking for a way to do this at the http layer with a cookie.  Is this a bad idea?
Aren't you concerned that the MAC in question can trivially be spoofed?

This is everything to which I hope that bitcoin (and crypto-freedom) stands in contrast.
If you have something to say, say it.  Don't let fear stop you.  Don't let banks or cops or lawyers stop you.  Speak and inspire those that can support you against whatever odds you may be facing.
I have been in the pressure cooker.  I have had attorneys tell me not to speak.  I made the choice to tell them that I felt obligated to say something out of my own lips, and ultimately I was able to proceed in a way that was 100% transparent while still adhering to the kind of decorum and position protection that my attorneys wanted.
I believe that this avenue is available to everyone.  If it isn't, then we have fundamentally lost freedom of speech.  I don't, however, think we're there.  I think that the silence is self-interested.
Again, my question: How can I trust them with my ID and bank details when they haven't even told me (formally) that they're shutting down?  Much less told me why?
This is just awful.

It's a free market.  Rational self-interest will lead miners (whom at that point will simply be payment processors) to prioritize transactions with higher fees.  Merchants and consumers will have an incentive to include higher fees to get their transactions processed more quickly.
In absolute BTC, surely the transaction fee will continue to decrease.  However, if the value of BTC against goods and services continues to increase, then the relative spending power of the transaction fees will increase as well.
Look, there are a number of serious issues with bitcoin that need to be addressed in the next decade or so.  This is not one of them.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:55:31
Agreed.  Let's remember too - they aren't mutually exclusive.  If you want to run a namecoin node on CJDNS, nobody is going to stop you.

I don't particularly like the consumptive vibe of black friday itself or putting "our date" first.  However, there's a reasonable movement that celebrates "buy nothing" day on black friday.  It seems plausible to me that we might be able to hook up with this movement and promote a "buy nothing with dollars" alternative.  
In essence: What we need is a day in which our movement commits to spending nothing but bitcoins for 24 hours.

I too was very reluctant to give them my info, but I did.  We'll see if that turns out to be a smart decision.

If you have a question for Ben about Bitcoin, you might be able to get a rep to ask him when he testifies before a house committee.

Always a good idea, but of course the "whale" may have many accounts with small balances.

I love this meme (not just this macro, but the general meme of btc-e being such a place), but I will say that I have learned how to read candle charts and depth charts from dabbling in day-trading, and I think those are valuable skills.

1. 30
2. I try to be a renaissance person, but I mostly write code when I'm broke and need some quick cash (I'm well known enough in the Python community to get work whenever I want it)
3. Just trying to advance the species.  Bitcoin is a good next step.  I only buy them to spend them.
4. It has already succeeded.  Wildly.  Something like it but better will someday come along and succeed a little bit more, and so on.
5. Faster transactions will help make it more viable for in-person transactions, which I try to stick to.  Also, I wish the protocol were less prone to being dominated by ASICs, because it's tough to describe it as democratic once people really start asking the tough questions about who is mining and how.
