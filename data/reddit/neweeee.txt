They have houndreds of thousands bitcoins from 2010-2011.
They pumped the price: no fiat withdrawal, price go up, and follow them the main btc exchanges.
Now they just dump their bitcoins, much higher price than in 2011. Btc widrawal halted. Who would sell his bitcoins, if the price is much higher on other exchanges. everybody just wait.
They sell all of their bitcoins, keep all the fiat money, while others just holding.
When they start the btc withdrawals, it will crash other exchanges, because everybody will sell his cheap mtgox btcs on other exchanges.
MtGox will kill the Bitcoin.
All the MtGox is just a pump&amp;dump scheme.

from the thread:
’m afraid this is a highly simplistic view of the costs of running a full node.
My node consumes fantastic amounts of data traffic, which is a real cost.
In the 30 days ending Apri 6, my node:
* Received 36.8 gb of data
* Sent 456.5 gb data
At my geographic service location (Singapore), this cost about $90 last month for bandwidth alone. It would be slightly cheaper if I was hosted in the US of course.
But anyone can understand that moving a half-terrabyte of data around in a month will not be cheap.

@_date: 2014-08-06 21:07:47
Most of the 2 bil transactions will be offchain transactions.
* If you buy a coke or coffee, the transaction fee is too high.
Most of the people will store some bitcoin money in a wallet provider (like the inputs.io was, or the new one, the circle is//Where is my invite?//) and pay zero transaction fee for small buyings.
Only the big money will travel in the blockchain.

The users can spend it for services from the start.
They keep nothing from the premined coins, but starts to buy back from the start for cash, and give value to it from the start.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:43:34
Why not? It's the same like the bitcoin, but much more users, adopted with a billion of users, no early adopters with huge amounts.
If after the start the system independent from the Google/Facebook, it's not worse than bitcoin, maybe better.

I don't care the price in the coming 1-2 years.
I bought few hundreds for the next 50 years.
And I bought some to my family, for Christmas.
In this year the Christmas will be interesting, i will give some handwritten private keys to my family, in empty envelopes... :)

We don't need ppcoin.
All that microtransactions will be offchain and instant with services like inputs.io.
WARNING: Ppcoin in the pump phase in the last 8 days!
The price pumped from 0.0015 to 0.003-0.004.
Somebody just wants more bitcoins.

The small transactions, micropayments don't need the blockchain and confirmations. We will store the money for everyday use in wallets, like coinbase, inputs.io.
If you buy a coke, you don't need blockchain transaction with high fee.
Only the large transactions will use the blockchain.

Facebook/Google can distribute the coins easy to their users: if the user set an address in his/her account, he/she just get the amount of coins for free.
All the premined coins they give to their users, they not keep any from it.
After the start anybody can mine it open, like any other altcoins.
This coin can be started facebook/google, but after the distribution it will be independent.
Anybody can sell/buy it, facebook/google too.

Why not use bitstamp.net (in Slovenia, fast money transfer with SEPA)? it's cheaper than mtgox
