Not in Roppongi but I live pretty close to that area.
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:10:01
Not really. Pink Cow accepts btc in Roppongi. Also a btc atm at the headquarters of Bitflyer in Akasaka.

First off, just to let it out, I'm very uneducated about this subject. Is it safe to keep your unplugged NFC device in your wallet or bag with you on a daily basis? Aren't there scanners or some intelligent device that can track NFC info? Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-07 04:39:57
Gotcha! Thanks~
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:23:45
If the card doesn't hold any keys, then where is the private key stored? What's the point of transaction signatures via NFC card if the private key isn't stored on it? I'm having a feeling that Trezor is a better solution for situations like this... Correct me if I'm wrong plz.

Really really retarded question: Can this ssl certification be configured not only on regular servers but PCs/software as well? Browsers/Bitcoin Apps (Bitcoin Core/Armory/Electrum) ?
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:25:54
Sorry I'm not understanding the security advantages of owning such card..
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:14:07
In order to use the card, you would have to be near a router using the Mycelium cable, correct? It think it will take some time before the router points are implemented don't you think?
@_date: 2015-12-01 12:08:24
Thanks for the thorough explanation. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:02:54
Can you please provide some examples (besides bitcoin) explaining some of the benefits of using the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-05-09 02:36:02
Shut up and take my money! Have any idea when the card would be available for backing or purchase?
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:53:24
bitflyer bro.
@_date: 2016-03-05 09:24:24
Meaning that the copied wallet from the desktop should be able to sign multisig transactions from your mobile?
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:58:22
I got it working! Thanks~
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:37:55

Even though the Google Authenticator app pops up after clicking on the "Register U2F Authenticator" button in the u2fdemo test site and apply the Ledger unplugged card on the back of my Android, the site gives a 'Authentication app couldn't run' error..

 is your best bet.
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:22:22
I give you my kudos, my friend.
@_date: 2016-01-24 06:20:54
I would like to purchase one but every time the site is saying the product is sold out...
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:38:40
So do you think it's best to create a multisig address to prevent the possible chance of duplication?
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:14:54
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:49:53
Hmmm seems the test site provided doesn't work with the Ledger Unplugged via Android's Chrome app. Any luck?
@_date: 2016-03-19 07:28:48
The image of Bitcoin here in Japan is still a bit negative due to the Mt.Gox incident but as long as the Government, Exchanges, and respected companies are making moves, it'll slowly become the norm. The really annoying part is Japan is primarly a conservative country so it will take some time before people even start to spark an interest.
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:20:22
A few taps meaning that you can exchange JPY&lt;-&gt;BTC without having to register/confirm Japanese banking information? I'm a bit confused as to how you can buy bitcoins in a few taps.
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:28:57
Even though it says in the Google Play store that it supports the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor protocol, I don't see any option in the Google Authenticator app which allows me to use the FIDO U2F on its behalf...
@_date: 2016-03-15 02:49:05
This. Is. Huge.
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:29:53
What if the copay servers go down/become unavailable? Would you still be able to send multisig transactions?
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:55:51
I see. This means that once opening the app, it will randomly select an open source server closest to you?
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:01:13
Thanks a bunch. I appreciate your existence.
@_date: 2016-01-02 11:33:11
Great Video! Keep it up!
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:00:38
Is it just me or breadwallet doesn't have an address book for registering bitcoin addresses......
@_date: 2016-01-25 02:33:45
Thank you for your response! I am grateful for your kindness.

As a 'Pioneer', what makes your services better than  May I note that BitFlyer provides Basic&amp;Pro BTC Exchange (Built-in wallet included of course)/Blockchain Lab/FX Exchange/BTC Crowdfunding service/chainFlyer transaction search engine.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:02:34
Does it work with Mycelium?
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:26:25
Yep. I did all that.

@_date: 2016-12-03 03:37:08
Depending on your Japanese exchange, it is currently ¥90,200 JPY right now.

Trezor. Electrum.
@_date: 2016-02-14 07:53:30
I was thinking more like you enter in your BIP32 pubkey into the system and it prints out a qrcode each time the customer wants the check.

Could you explain why a Pi2 works well?
@_date: 2016-02-29 00:59:08
@_date: 2016-02-06 06:39:42
The price tag for the advanced features is a bit much don't you think?
@_date: 2016-02-02 08:09:14
Please teach me the ways of building one from scratch.
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:22:17
Wait a sec...I'm misunderstanding something here. Mine and node is not the same thing??
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:49:06
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:20:53
Thanks for the lengthy response! Don't really know the tech-side of how the blockchain works but don't you think the size of the blockchain being downloaded will just continue to grow and grow till the end of time? Do you think we'll have enough space for a Pi2 to hold all that??
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:53:54
Wow this is pretty huge for Japan..Can you provide a link?
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:39:59
Backed up! Unfortunetly, I don't recall where I specified the data directory...
@_date: 2016-02-02 10:09:04
Interesting....What do you suggest I should do with my Pi2 for instance?
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:58:19
Attain it. Hold it. Use it. Share it.
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:29:16
I only used QT for Armory to function. I think there isn't a need to backup the wallet.dat file since I've never used it as a wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-25 06:52:41
I went to PE in Roppongi a few weeks ago but they said it was temporarily out of order. It may be working now...but I heard the fee is pretty pricey. You might have better luck at the meetups if you don't have a registered Japanese bank account to exchange yen @ the bitflyer exchange.
@_date: 2016-02-02 08:01:43
I'm not trying to start a core debate here or anything but is there a step by step guide on how to build a mining node from scratch using a Pi2? I'm currently using one as a cold storage device right now so I know the basics on how to build one to an operating state for the most part..
@_date: 2016-02-08 01:26:15
A bit annoying when you have to re-connect 10 times before it starts working completes the transaction...
@_date: 2015-04-24 04:56:15
There are actually a few joints here in the Shibuya/Roppongi area apparently (awabar roppongi?). There should be a website available for all the people who want to spend btc in Tokyo though.

Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-04-07 11:09:17

No way!! I need to check it out pronto! Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:01:25
Not sure if Mycelium has the function specifically for cold storage purposes. If you want to make your droid a cold wallet, you should take a look at this thread 
@_date: 2015-11-30 05:28:36
5%~ is a bit high don't you think? :/
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:24:03
Perhaps they're promoting their Youtube BTC channel or something. Looks like they're in Roppongi or Azabu area. Anyhow, kudos!
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:11:00
According to their release notes, Electrum's new 2.0 release may support offline cold wallets for Android as well 
Their site will be updated with the 2.0 downloadables momentarily.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:31:21
I would have to agree with you on that note.
@_date: 2015-03-15 12:59:40
Thanks for the info! I'll look into it.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:24:43
Thanks for the info but I wanted to watch-only via the Mycelium app. Seems its not possible registering a ChangTip address as of now.
@_date: 2015-11-30 05:28:03
There's one ATM at the bitFlyer HQ in Akasaka but heard it isn't functioning at the moment..
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:31:18
Meaning that only one (out of the many xpubs generated from the offline HD) can be used remotely as a watch-only?
Just for kicks...If other transactions have been sent to the offline HD, the registered watch-only xpub on the seedless wallet wouldn't be able to display the balances of those transactions due to the nature of the auto-generating xpub BIP32 mechanism from the offline wallet correct? If so, I would have to send transactions only to the watch-only xpub in order for it to display in seedless wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-21 12:47:46
Looks very usable. Definitely need Japanese.
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:27:32
This is actually a pretty good idea! Set your own price and get paid for a download. I can totally see how this service will be used wrongly...kudos though!
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:14:43
Thanks of the info!! I'll stay tuned for any updates.
Totally different question but I wanted to know...What are your views towards Tails compared other OS's, like the ones you have included in your script?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:26:58
haha hell yeah man!
@_date: 2015-03-04 10:13:52
ninki wallet 
Never used it though...
Ninki means "Popular" in Japanese btw
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:19:18
Interesting read..
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:06:57
Great Scott! They really beefed things up! Seems Armory may have some serious competition...
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:01:54
Simply because I would like to spread the word and educate bitcoin's hot and cold capabilities of Mycelium and its hardware all over Tokyo. People would love it here.
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:05:58
Huge news.
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:33:47
Mycelium for sure.
@_date: 2015-03-02 10:13:10
I wish lol. I would be the last person to know the functions of such sophisticated software. Check my post history for more info lol.
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:45:35
Dude. Armory man.
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:17:49
Thanks a bunch! As long as I can register the xpub address to an online wallet, such as Mycelium, it should be able to display all the transactions of the xpub's generated public addresses from the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:07:32
I'll try out coinkite as well but I doubt it'll work.
I'm cool with using proprietary software to create multisigs and all but it would be nice to successfully mix it up a bit with different wallet signatures..
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:14:57
Thanks for confirming. Truly helps.
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:25:08
How's the status?
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:53:41
Can you please help explain the security of Mycelium's private key policy? I've heard countless times of people talking about how Mycelium's private key is not encrypted making it vulnerable to Malware directly within the phone. What makes storing the keys in sql better than, for example, automatic encrypted backups using the Airbitz wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-02 10:53:16
@_date: 2015-03-15 12:20:39
I may not be understanding how a P2SH public address is generated from the m-of-n addresses if there is no private address tied to the P2SH address.
@_date: 2015-03-16 01:27:44
Stupid Question: Is the Testnet version a pre-release before the same features are available on the normal Mycelium application? Is it not as safe, or buggy, compared to the normal version? There are so many extra awesome options on the Testnet version.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:39:09
I knew you were going to show up in this thread...lol
It would awesome if you can share how coinkite can work with other wallets to accomplish multisig signing and/or broadcasting.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:21:51
Thanks for the info! Didn't know coinkite could also do cold offline signatures. I thought the system was only based online.
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:38:58
I mean installing a fresh copy of cold offline 0.93 bundle to a freshly installed ubuntu installation. 
I thought it was good practice to not allow your cold machine to ever touch the net?
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:46:43
I thought putting a cold wallet in the mix would significantly decrease the risk..
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:09:30
What version of Ubuntu will 2.0 safely run under?
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:14:25
Seems like some sort of ad campaign? The girls are sporting BTC wear.
@_date: 2015-03-06 08:45:51
Where's Count von Count when we need him...
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:08:37
I see what you mean. What steps would you recommend to prepare an Armory cold node on ubuntu? Security-wise, until what extent should a cold wallet be in terms of when it should not be connected to the net?
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:15:16
Thanks for the explanation. I have a better understanding now!!
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:03:55
Just to let you know, your script works like a charm. I have my Pi 2 up and already accomplished several offline signings. I'll soon be purchasing a trezor to experiment what it can do with ARM machine.
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:26:09
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:28:19
Sounds like an awesome idea. I have a ton of friends who would love to use one for their businesses.
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:31:25
Will you be implementing Electrum's finalized 2.0 release in your setup script?
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:34:45
Please correct me if I'm wrong but I thought Mycelium does accomplish backups by giving the HD wallet owner the Master seed  information during the backup verification process (PIN required) and store private keys in an encrypted sqlite3 file in internal storage.
Even if such phone gets stolen, how can the funds get easily stolen with these layers?
@_date: 2015-03-16 10:06:08
Why yes there is. There's actually a cold storage script for Raspberry Pi coded by here  
I have mine up and running and it works like a freakin charm!
@_date: 2015-02-26 13:07:20
Here is a chocolate chip cookie for all your generous help I'll definitely let you know if there are any further obstacles.
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:07:00
Very informative video!! Too bad the people here in Tokyo are scared poopless to participate due to the huge exchange scandal that happened in the past :P
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:16:05
I would have to say Armory is the best desktop wallet but not too user friendly for beginners..
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:23:36
Thanks for all your help. Truly appreciated.
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:16:31
What do you suggest the best way or software to use in order to secure a wallet via BIP38?
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:08:57


That sounds like something Jay-Z would say.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:07:29
Isn't there a way to do that via smart contracts? Not sure myself though...
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:18:13
Thanks cool man!
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:54:18
Nice! Can't wait to cope the latest copy. Any version release notes by any chance?
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:14:55
Now that's what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2015-03-15 01:12:02
Thanks! Even if they don't have all the signatures they need to release the bitcoins, isn't possible to reverse the P2SH address somehow and obtain its private key?
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:11:37
I got that email too. Wish I had more coins to participate..
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:08:33
Gotcha, Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-15 01:05:55
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:36:35
Gotcha, that's solely why a balance wouldn't show up...
Thanks for the help guys.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:19:15
I don't know the specifics when it comes to what right, or wrong, protocols Mycelium uses over Tor but I'm assuming its establishing secure connections in such an unsafe environment...
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:46:06
If you were able to detect the users somehow who are disobeying the terms of use, I think the sites popularity and quality will definitely mature fast. I can see a lot of writers, film-related individuals, and musicians using this on a daily basis.
You should also consider creating a ranking/recommended download page for those who have spare time and want to spend their BTCs on something of value. Similar to Kickstarter or like the Ebook store recommendation page amazon offers.
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:42:33
I actually have one. Haven't used it yet but you can use the card anywhere they accept UnionPay. You basically own a BTC wallet that the card draws money from.
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:28:45
ANX Debit Master Card. Never used it though...
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:05:39
Does anyone know?
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:26:47
Way ahead of you bro hehe
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:47:23
I wish I could give you a chocolate chip cookie. I really appreciate you sharing such meaningful information. I will go out and get me one of those Pi 2 devices.
When you talk about epoxying your device (USB Wifi Dongle?), how exactly does this prevent anyone from connecting my cold offline machine to the net? Are there authentication preventive features on the dongle?
Even if they take my MicroSD card, would it be secured via LUKS LVM encryption?
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:01:06
What about dogecoin or litecoin?
@_date: 2015-02-23 09:24:32
Especially Japanese governments. I guarantee you they will start advertising BT years after the ball has been somewhat successfully moving in other countries. Can you believe Visa Debit Cards started becoming available from major Japanese banks only 1/2 year ago?...fml
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:24:31
The same 2 of 3 multisig combo can be done with an offline PC + phone + laptop as well right? Or is that considered a huge security risk?
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:19:06
Oops! What I meant was by using your script's ! option and pre-installing the three offline wallets before saying farewell to internet access forever, there wouldn't be much of any extra advantages other than you having the option to freely use three different types of secured wallets on your cold SBC right?
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:53:03
Do you mean by using onion Tor available on Blockchain.info's site? Or a totally different entity? I'm just not grasping this onion concept.
@_date: 2015-02-26 13:23:31
Total noob question here. Why would you want to install 3 different highly secured wallets (Trezor/Electrum/Armory) on the same cold offline when maintaining one would be adequate to do the job?
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:42:20
Yikes!! I'm curious as to what platform would you recommend to overcome faulty designs such as Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-03-03 08:30:34
hmm seems OSX executable is still not available..
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:58:37
Do you know if Mycelium over Tor is also using SSL/Socks support as well? It scares me to think they would implement their app to run over such an unsecured network...
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:52:41
bitFlyer in Tokyo.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:13:42
That sounded cool.
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:52:50
I thought Mycelium was the choice for everyday use when it comes to security? What's so good about Airbitz compared to Mycelium?
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:33:52
Gotcha! As long as I keep my MicroSD card in a safe place (either creating an encrypted LUKS LVM container for the wallet backups or taking a stab at building the kernel from source), it should be all cool beans.
I wouldn't mind playing around with the actual Single Board after I get my cold offline machine's MicroSD setup. I mean, all I would have to do is purchase a totally different MicroSD card to play around with and make sure any USB wifi/ethernet cables aren't plugged in whenever I insert the cold offline MicroSD's OS. Or is that considered vulnerable practice?
I'll definitely follow up on your installer script once my Pi 2 arrives.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:45:03
So this article is claiming that the Tor network is a essentially a feeding ground for hackers to pickoff and hijack so called secured BTC transactions?? If its so unsafe, why is Mycelium advertising the Tor option so much on its app?
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:26:42
I've tried the following images:
All failed due to insufficient dependencies.
Perhaps I should try out the flat 12.04 version and see if it works...
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:40:37
Awesome thread btw! Can't wait for changetip's future upgrades and expansions to take flight!
@_date: 2016-07-13 03:35:52
Please...we don't want coinbase here...
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:22:44
Sir, You have greatly intrigued me! I seriously am thinking about investing in either the Pi 2 or the Odroid C1. Do you think it would be a better choice to go for the C1 (Fast specs?) instead of the Pi 2 (More Popular?) as it seems these tools you speak of [Trezor/btchip, SSSS, offline multisig signing, LUKS LVM encryption, etc] may not be available for ARMhf platforms? 
As for your recommendation on epoxying all the ports. From my understanding, this is just casing for the Pi 2/C1 machines to prevent it from unwanted static and waterproof insurance? And what does the casing have to do with the USB Wifi dongle you had provided? Please correct me if I'm wrong...I'm really new these Pi 2/C1 devices :P

From what I understand, when the value of your current BTC is lower than the value of the time you exchanged it from a fiat currency (constantly having it compared to any given BTC exchange); it's only then when it is determined "low" or not. That's why custom profile options which are constantly comparing the values of your current BTCs are so benifitial.

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't the ETH price raise/fall in conjunction with the BTC price at almost all times? If the BTC panic sellers do proceed to sell before aug 1, the ETH price will also fall with it right?

Once either BIP148, legacy, or Bitmaincoin has been decided will 1Augustorg be updated with the latest status?

As a majority of you already know, wallets such as Mycelium, Electrum, Trezor etc, allow you to own and maintain your own private keys for various crypto-coins. In the case of Monero, for example, wallets like Freewallet allow you to maintain the coin but do you actually own the private key? Or are the keys stored remotely on some server controlled by the company? Any experts out there?

I have all my btc inside my trezor via mycelium and plan not to touch my coins until after Aug 1st. I should be ok to move my coins once either BIP148, legacy, or Bitmaincoin has been decided as the main lead right?

I really feel you shouldn't be too concerned about having the money picked up by someone else in case if he actually did throw it away. BTC isn't nearly as popular and trusted as it is internationally. Good work on saving the key...I would definitely check up on it next time you roll through.

I see! Is it also possible to encrypt HD wallet private keys to BIP38 or it may not be required because it only consists of a 12 word combination?

Thanks for that correction!! What exactly would I have to do in order to create this so called encrypted container around my backup files?
I fully understand now that it's ok to have my node connected to the internet for the initial setup process **only until** the point of opening up the app and creating my new cold wallet.

Gotcha! If you were to install everything, for instance using the ! option, would there be any advantages to your BTC security? Or would it simply be an act of redundancy?
