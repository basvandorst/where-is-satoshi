Probably. I just like the idea of my rigs paying for the power they use :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:04:55
Will a 500 sat/byte go through right now?

Mining Pool Hub + Multipoolminer. Set auto exchange to BTC. Few bucks a day. 
(I make $3-6 CAD a day on each of my 7 1060s)
Go look in the Mining Pool Hub reddit.

Thanks again :)

I'd be in jail after that conversation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:16:15
*sigh* .. I will try 100 CAD (925 ish sat/bytes) and see what happens hehe :/
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:42:10
Similar story. But i also mine. I'm just about ready to cash out because of whatever is happening now (IF i even can lol). I will get 99% back of everything i spent on coins and mining hard ware. Will live with whatever i mine from then on.
100% chance the price will go up a LOT after i do so keep your head up hahah

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:09:37
Lol, 92. Why?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:06:18
Yup.. I know the risks and im holding it :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:24:47
Who is this dbag? I feel like i should know. Everything about him just oozes piece of shit. The look in his eyes, mannerisms, ect.. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:07
I pay my hydro (and sometimes internet) bill with it from my mining rig.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:48:27

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:23:46

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:30:20
I bought (too much) at 18k because i was afraid it would never be under 20 again heh FML
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:20:43
Keep up the good fight brother.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:06

Welcome to FeeCoin

Just read the readme for multipoolminer. The author of the program is very helpful on the bitcointalk forums.

Forget the exact amount i pay for power but my monthly bills have gone up about 5 CAD since i started. So 125ish a month. A bit less now since everything dropped hehe. Its all free "money" to me so i don't really care heh

I mine with 2 GTX 1060s i already had. I use NiceHash to daul mine on each card. Mostly ETH+SIA or ETH+PASCAL. Whatever NiceHash chooses. NiceHash pays out in Bitcoin. I have to pay a fee with each payout but i make about 130 CAD (in BTC) a month. With better cards (AMD), and more of them, you could make a pofit. Just be prepared for a 3-4 month ROI.

I had a hard time buying (no non expired id, looong story, and my debit did not work with quickbt) so i just took the amount i wanted to buy and spent it on a few (4+1 i had) GPUs. Hooked them up with spare PC parts i had laying around and mined alt coins with nice hash. Took 4 months to get the CAD i spent in actual BTC. Now i get BTCs for free minus a bit of hydro :P
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:17:59
Whatever is the most profitable that day. Nice hash will switch on the fly.
You can get any old used $20 motherboard/CPU/RAM combo (with at least 4 pcie slots) you want, some cheap PCI risers and a **good** PSU.. and you're good. You can set it and forget it or check on it all the time like i do. heh
