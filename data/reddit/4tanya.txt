Good! [This was their stance, when I asked a year ago](

you're welcome. thanks for the tips, I'll be sure to pass them on.

You are missing the point.  I didn't jump on the bitcoin train because of the low fees and fast transaction times alone.  Those two things alone however, allowed me to experience how bitcoin works. It's what makes things click for a lot of people and that's the beginning of going down the bitcoin rabbit hole.  Downloading a wallet, and sending one simple transaction to see it confirmed a few minutes later.  Users nowadays will not download a bitcoin wallet to see how it works. It's too expensive to discover/experience bitcoin if you don't know what it is.  We'll end up being the only users of the protocol, if we don't keep the User Experience up to par.  The same User Experience that we first encountered when we discovered bitcoin ourselves.  
I'm not advocating for low on-chain fees forever.  Just for long enough that we can reach some kind of greater adoption. Long enough until we have stable 2nd layer solutions that can provide the same UX.  The time is not now.

**Host**: Mr minister, are you a consultant for a company that promotes bitcoin? 
**Varoufakis**: laughs
**Host**: Why are you laughing.   
**Varoufakis**: I’m glad you are asking
**Host**: Today on the newspaper, they say there was a picture of you on this company’s website, where there is also a video of you taking a positive stance for bitcoin.
**V**: I didn’t see the video
**H**: I saw the video
**V**: One of my academic interests before getting into politics, was electronic money.  It interests me very much.  I find it very fascinating… Look internationally I have become known as a critic of bitcoin.  If you ask the bitcoin community, they will say that Varoufakis is their critic.  They write entire articles against me.
**H** : Did you have anything to do with that company?
**V**: Yes of course, I will explain... I’m very proud it of it actually.
**H**: Does this relationship still continue now?
**V**: Of course not.  Look what happened… I was very interested in the algorithms that this cryptographic electronic currency is based on…I wanted to study it more… from an academical aspect…I was even in a debate where I was the opponent of bitcoin.
This company is based in Singapore...  It’s a startup, made up of 3-4 young technologists.  Very clever and interesting people.  They came to me having read my criticism for bitcoin… Along with my criticism however I also state that the algorithm that bitcoin is based on is extremely interesting, and can most probably be used for something else other than currency.  I have characterized bitcoin as an amazing solution that is looking to solve a problem.  The problem is not the currency, it’s something else.  So these guys came in touch with me, and asked me “so what could that problem be”….  What I convinced them to do is abandon bitcoin (*as a currency), and instead use the algorithms and the technology for something else.  I did work with them… doing some consultancy and giving them a report to create a different platform that I called ‘Trust’…  This collaboration ended last December.  On their website, they kept my picture and my name, just as other websites do… such as the university of Stockholm, which could appear that I’m still there.. It sometimes takes a while for them to update these pages.  I no longer have any business relation with them.

I've also decided to also speak out after many years of lurking. Here's what I think:
It's absurd that in such an early phase of bitcoin, some people will allow the very features that attracted us to bitcoin in the first place, be eliminated. Low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. The use cases of bitcoin continue to be diminished in favor of the so called "preservation of decentralization". Yet it is with greater adoption that decentralization will increase. We cannot keep recklessly adding to the blockchain forever, but people need to realize that the next 2-4 years are vital, and messing with the status quo right now (allowing for huge backlogs + high fees), will seriously hinder the potential of adoption. It's too early to be imposing such transaction fees on users. The block reward is still high, and makes up for miners' income. You are taking away from the very User Experience of bitcoin. In it's current state, Bitcoin is too expensive to be introduced to. How many of you got interested by sending a test transaction, to see how it works, before getting hooked. Will new users seriously need to spend a $1 to experience what is bitcoin? No, they will start with something else like &lt;insert crypto here&gt;, and at that time they might as well stick to what they experience first, if they like it. There goes bitcoins first mover advantage...
Bitcoin is not even ready to become a store of wealth (if you advocate for that). We do not have enough users onboard yet. We do not have mainstream adoption. We need utility, we need more use cases, we need growth in the ecosystem, and that is largely driven by good User Experience. Right now we are heading the opposite way. It's getting harder and harder for people to experience the fun that is bitcoin.
I have been following bitcoin pretty much daily for many years now, without being vocal about anything but it just hurts witnessing the current state of affairs. I believe that in addition to SW as a hardfork, the bitcoin blocksize needs to be increased in order to allow for the onboarding of new users. If not, another crypto will step up and take bitcoin's place. If Bitcoin cannot be agile and embrace hard-forks to cleanly improve its technical capability, it risks becoming the dinosaur of the cryptospace.

So around a month ago, he posted proof of someone having done a trade with him: 
 
I have found the bitcoin address involved in that trade to be:
Surprise surprise. 0 transactions.
