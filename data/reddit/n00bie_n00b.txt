I think you literally described an offline version of the lightning network ie sidechains/ledgers
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:56:22
Yeah you see I knew you'd jump to that side of the fence. But you need to look this objectively, citizens have no say in the creation of money, no voting rights, in fact most central banks aren't even part of government. When did you last vote on what you'd like the inflation rate to be?
Printing money is called seigniorage, look it up on Wikipedia... I'll quote an important line: "seigniorage is a convenient source of revenue by providing the government with increasing purchasing power at the expense of the public's purchasing power". 
The world nominal GDP is increasing every year but nominal income earnings won't reach nominal wage parity to 2007 levels until 2027 (in UK anyway). That's 20 years worth of wealth stolen from an entire generation and for what? To bail-out banks who over leveraged and fraudulently pumped a housing bubble, and then held the government hostage by freezing all liquidity. 
But whatever yeah, just saying 'tin-hat' to an argument makes you look cool. Read a fucking book.

I personally don't see the MS going for the micropayments space. I think this is much, much bigger than how almost everyone (spare a few) see bitcoin. We need to stop seeing it as money but as information. Immutable, uncorruptable, publicly viewable and verifiable. 
L2 solutions will use the world's mostly strongly protected decentralised public chain to 'stamp' their information onto, whether that be land deeds, identity, flight reservations, whatever... Something like this has never existed before. 
Peer-to-peer cash may be what it started out as but i think this will only be a very small use case in the future.

North Korea will be the scapegoat they use to try and regulate access to cryptocurrencies. The fact is the central banking system is robbing an entire generation of income and savings and dumping into already wealthy assets holders so that the government can keep spending fiat on whatever the fuck it likes. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:57:58
I did. Any article that takes about scaling and deliberately ignores and fails to mention the massive amount of development going on and the fact that LN is in active mainnet testing is a FUD article and biased. It's not faith, it's objective fact.

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:42:25
More wallets are bringing segwit adoption out in January which should reduce overall pressure on the network. Can you set a lower fee for a slower transaction time?
Unless you really need to move it I'd leave that amount where it is for the time being given that LN has reached mainnet testing stage. (very low fees possible in a time line of months) treat it more like an investment for now. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:18:39
Your answer is in the your title... 'of the future'. The point is if the problem was solved today you wouldn't be able to buy bitcoin for sub-20k prices as it would make most alts obsolete and their 300B market cap would be in bitcoin plus all the new users who can now use btc for everything.
So right now you just have to 'put up with' speculation and 100% growth each month. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:26:24
as the first channels open up, high fee paying users jump across first and utilize cheap transactions from then on, meanwhile as they no longer clog up on-chain space, fees come down, more people move to channels. cycle continues ... that's how.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:42:57
New use cases can develop in this system. Micro payments via smart contracts. You could pay for a taxi by the second for example.
Looking further ahead. Robots powered by AI that are their own legal entities doing everything from parcel deliveries to agriculture. There may only be 8billion humans but there will be a lot more robots than that.

Really, ordinary Greek citizens did this? No doubt the Greek politicians were corrupt and lined their own pockets. They were also deceptive and fraudulent in their national accounting to join the euro but that does not excuse the actions taken by the Bundesbank. Greek needs to default on their debt and leave the euro but the effects of this are systemic, Germany is not loaning money to Greece out of generosity, they did it out of a self-serving interest to protect their own bond holders at the expense of ordinary Greek citizens. The Greeks did not want these loans, they are not repayable, the citizens of Greece are indebted in perpetuity to Germany. This is mob like loan-sharking on a national scale.

Personally I'd watch 20mins of YouTube videos to get a quick rough idea.
-Currency - store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account, (in that order)
Crypto- short for cryptography. Part of the solution for keeping the protocol secure and helping to solve the 'double-spend' problem (along with game theory, incentives, proof-of-work, node validation etc)
Transaction: sign in to your wallet, add an address of a recieving wallet, declare amount to send. Send.
Cash out? What's that?..... Hodl.
Exchanges or peer-to peer. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:02:50
Ah ok. Nice to know it didn't even make a correction list. Stupid Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:17:04
I was thinking about proof-of-work today, what it is and why it is needed. It's essentially game theory in action. Humans self-greed keeping the network secure and making sure it costs a bad actor more than it is worth to attack, so much so that they'd actually be better off joining in.
All of this is required because we fundamentally can't trust anyone. So with that in mind what could replace this. Proof-of-stake and other methods have been proposed but all have different upsides and downsides and will also have unintended and unknown consequences.
A couple of wild thoughts I had was instead of just having a reward framework maybe a penalizing framework might somehow be developed....proof-of-mutually-assured-destruction perhaps? 
Or my favourite: proof-of-distance....let me explain. some sort of trust giving device (????) is stationed on the moon. To change the protocol you have to physically go up there and change said device. A bad actor would need some serious space skills to do so and could also be spotted doing so. It would also take time, due to distance and orbits and what-not, time enough for a consensus change to be implemented before they could arrive.
I don't know.....just writing my thoughts.....

hence....'future' like OP said. If scalability was solved do you think the price would be ~$17k/btc right now? the price you pay for wealth appreciation. 
And also whilst we're on the subject, almost nowhere takes ANY cryptocurrency anyway, so the whole argument seems to be theoretical and a bit academic at this moment in time.

Possibly. That won't be why it pumps though. My theory is btc was overbought last week, all alts dipped and where undervalued, the balance is back now, meanwhile the entire global market cap is exponentially up. Bot traders and whales have been throwing coins around to manipulate the price and keep it steady. Meanwhile several alts have had big pump and dumps, almost a new one each day. This is known as loading the spring. When the signal comes, traders are going to drop alts hard and create big fomo on a btc surge. It's happened many times before, pre-5k and pre-9k for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:34:48

And it costs me £15 to do a sepa transfer (any amount) with my bank. You misunderstood me....the price right now is low, because scalability is low, with full scalability the market cap would be in the trillions. Do you know Barclays Bank set a new record this year for the tx per second they cleared?.... Guess how many? 900 per second. 
We are are so incredibly close to a solution that can clear millions of tx per second. Lighting is passing tests on mainnet right now.

On the central banking point well if you don't know here's quite an informative and simple video from a cool youtube channel that is not 'tin-hatty' and gives an objective yet easily watchable overview of how it works and the history of them.
On the North Korea issue. Governments don't like decentralised, permissionless, unseizeable, uncontrollable, money as it robs them of their, somehow God given divine right, to devalue your income and savings on a whim, they can also seize your money, or freeze your account preventing you from participating in a digital world. No one has ever voted for this! So my point is, they will use 'terrorism' as the excuse to try and limit our ability to control our own wealth.

Amazon's P/E ratio is 279 for 2017. Every single market has speculators, that's the point. You put money in now because you expect the future to be better and therefore prove your investment just. If everything was the fair, real-time valuation, all valuations would be much lower.
Example: So you'd get one smart guy who bought loads at current fair-value and in the future the 'investment' (currency,stock etc) got better and they make a better return. As this is self evident others would do the same, thereby raising the current valuation.
Is bitcoin 850% better than it was in January ? No. The ecosystem is better, better protocol, more developments on testnet, more adopters, businesses, etc.. but in the future it may be 850% 'better'. Judging when irrational exuberance sets in, where valuations get wildly out of kilter to the realistic future development....that is when a correction is likely.
I see the the population of the planet as the user-base, the use-case is every single current monetary transaction (and more transaction uses yet to be developed) and as a service, unbeatable in it's class: can't be confiscated, won't inflate to nothing, immutable, economically not brute-force attackable etc etc. So I would say it is still undervalued.

why did you get flagged? well at the time you posted, the price was taking a nosedive. At such times a quite significant proportion of redditors here use this sub as a financial weapon to maximize their gains. They sell (put themselves into a short position) and then FUD the ever living hell out of this place to panic newbies and weak hands into panic-selling. Then when it reaches a stable floor they buy it up, log back in with a different account and start cheering the rallies again after buying the dip and increasing their holdings by 20% for free.
It all quite simple. It is most likely the the timing of your post, and its content was of this fud nature serving this selfish purpose which is not what this sub should be for.
Everything is up for discussion, but I have seen repeat fud posts, the exact same wording, during the bcash saga and china dip used during this latest '10k pullback' dip.

Do you know about ASIC Boost? This is not a free market for miners. It is hard coded to favour Jihan. It is purely for his profit alone. That is just a fact. I would say decentralisation is not the only reason for valuing a coin but it is the biggest and hence why bitcoin has remained the number 1.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:24:10
I'm guessing the next correction will be as we surge past 10k and there is speculative euphoria up to 11-12k and then it corrects to around 7.5k, purely going by the history and ratios seen on price history charts. So in my opinion now is an excellent time to buy. But I'm just a guy on the Internet.

The (London) Times: short column pieces like its some underdog stock that's done quite well for itself....'but don't worry yourself about it.'
The Telegraph: Openly hostile and warns readers off from even thinking of buying.

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:09:08
my apologies if its genuine. here would be my polite informed response:
Read up on blockchain fundamentals and you will see bitcoin is superior, primarily because it is totally decentralised, you might as well use visa otherwise.
The scaling problem is crypto wide, it's an area of active research worldwide and the second most popular computing course at Stanford after AI. There are excellent technical videos on youtube explaining the problem (computerphile just realised one for example) Potential solutions are being tested and implemented right now. check out stack over flow and github.
That's why bitcoin is still in the early adoption phase and so many people value it so highly.
Centalised networks dont suffer the same same scaling problems but you sacrifice utility for an authority on your money. Go ahead and buy Dash or some other altcoin they do not offer financial security, liberty or freedom.
Bcash is, and will be, owned by a handful of individuals who have full control of the currency and their scaling solution is not only flawed but to the pure benefit of themselves and not the users.

Thought experiment: 'Zero is an interesting number'
A complete collapse implies 1 btc = 0 (fiat unit). Which implies 21 million btc = 0 (Fiat unit). So I could buy all coins ever created for $10 if I wanted. However someone else can say "wow. $20 is not much to me I'll offer double what that guy is paying for all of them".... And on and on this would go. Until market forces found a value for them.

The fiat system is so convulted and expensive with withdrawal and deposit limits and conversion fees, account fees, wait times of 3-5 days for inter-currency/border trade. Plus relying on third party to do all this who can then decide at any time to just reject/suspend/freeze any transaction or account. And these are just some of the experiences i have had in the last month personally, not hypothetical situations. It seems very obvious to me that this type of currency is better and will only get better as it matures.

Sure blockchain has uses but if one central entity runs the entire blockchain the whole thing is redundant, it's no longer immutable which is the entire reason for it's purpose. 
Use a server for data entry, it's far more efficient. You can't have decentralization without blockchain and you can't have blockchain without decentralization. Ipso factso....Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:09
agreed. but i cannot agree the short term solution is to abandon ship and support centralisation efforts. there are ways. segwit adoption would have prevented this current problem for example and we have that right now.

Lookup Amazon stock. 
zoom in on 1998-1999. 1000%+ increase in a year. Almost unprecedented, of course it corrected in the dot-com crash. But then look at the price today.
Just because things go up v.fast doesn't mean they are doomed to crash and not recover.

Wow they are genuinely scared for when/if crypto really, really takes off there will be a run on the banks.
This is amazing. Popcorn ready.
Also they complain about lack of liquidity with private currencies for when banks make loans (with our deposits) that turn sour and the central bank can not add 'liquidity' if the loan was private currency backed. ie they can't print money and devalue everyone's income and savings to bail out banks when they make bad investment choices and a financial crisis hits.
Fucking diddums. You can not reap the reward in the good times and hold hostage the taxpayer in the bad. 
With private currency all your holdings are A-OK in such situations.

Read up on blockchain fundamentals and you will see bitcoin is superior, primarily because it is totally decentralised, you might as well use visa otherwise.
The scaling problem is crypto wide, it's an area of active research worldwide and the second most popular computing course at Stanford after AI. There are  excellent technical videos on youtube explaining the  problem (computerphile just realised one for example) Potential solutions are being tested and implemented right now. check out stack over flow and github.
That's why bitcoin is still in the early adoption phase and so many people value it so highly.
Centalised networks dont suffer the same same scaling problems but you sacrifice utility for an authority on your money. Go ahead and buy Dash or some other altcoin they do not offer financial security, liberty or freedom.
Bcash is, and will be, owned by a handful of individuals who have full control of the currency and their scaling solution is not only flawed but to the pure benefit of themselves and not the users.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:00:30
Simply: If a currency is just a unit of exchange (no inherent value...hate that phrase) then:
Value per unit currency= [world's productivity and assets (+future potential)]/amount of currency units

Bob, my math(s) could be wrong on this but here goes....
USDT market cap = $537,175,247,
No. of bitcoins in circulation = 16,672,825
$537,175,247 / 16,672,825 = $32.21
If all the USDT is fake and it was all used to pump BTC they increased the price by just over $32. 
Am I missing something? Genuinely, not sarcastically?

Nothing. Gartner hype cycle doing it's thing. It's speculation. For those who've read up on the innovations in the pipe line this price and market cap it low long-term but high in the short-term. Hence speculation. Just like Amazon stock was back in 1998 when it rose over 1000%, investors speculated because they believed that this thing called 'the internet' may just turn out to be revolutionary. Was a jumped up online book store worth more that Sears Roebuck in 1998 which had hundreds of departments stores? No. But look at market caps today: Sears at $440M and Amazon at $550B. So that's my answer.

I don't think I should be taxed because they are devaluing their currencies through inflation (ie stealing our income and savings simultaneously) to pay down their sovereign debt (by making it more payable). This should not be my problem. 
I'm happy to pay tax don't get me wrong, for a functional society, but it should be a 1:1 ratio, what you pay in for a year say, is what the government spends for a year.
What I won't except is that I have to pay for the policies of career politicians who have now long retired who historically gave away free higher-education, and ridiculous pension guarantees on the backs of the workers of the younger generation.Where do I get to vote on what inflation should be?

People will have the choice to go with third party payment channels who can provide capital in the lightning network so there will be clusters of centralisation offering a service but taking fees, it's a trade off for more convenience, but will be a user choice whether to use them or not, I imagine there will many options available. So I guess as long as firms adapt in this ecosystem they'll do just fine and we'll keep using them because they provide services we want.

My thoughts:
Inflation in the UK is at 3% and will likely stay at this level or even increase a bit for a few years. Even then the target is still 2%. So this time next year you've *lost* £180 (assuming interest from the bank is pretty much zero.... Which they mostly are). 
Cash ISA's give you a little over 2% and you have to lock your money up for that..... And still you *lose* money after inflation is accounted for. 
Stocks and shares? Well sure they have been going up averaging around 16% the last 2 years but in my experience you don't get that, because you'll be in a passive index tracker fund, they have *low* fees of 0.6% and you'll get a return of about 5-6%, beating inflation IF the stocks keep going up. If it crashes you've lost 20-30% (short to medium term right there) and some say a crash may happen in the next one to two years, who knows.
Then we get onto brexit, if you hold GBP prepare to get shafted, imo, it's down massively against the dollar and euro and the UK hasn't even left yet and the negotiations are going f*king terribly.
So ok, if you accept all that but would rather take the loss of value rather than risk, fair enough.... But what are you saving it for? A house deposit presumably? Well, being in a generation where house prices rise faster than average salaries, the required deposit you need will rise faster than you can save for it. So you will end up with a modest pile always too short to be able to spend it but too much to *waste* it.
That was my logic. If it all goes to shit, I'm exactly where I am now, living off income day-to-day just like capitalism wants me to be because it has eaten our generation.

I use Kraken. You have to deposit in euros so you need to make a SEPA transfer to deposit funds. For this I opened a Fidor bank account which has cheap sepa fees. Kraken fees are higher than GDAX but way cheaper than say coinbase. Obviously depends on economies of scale a bit. If you want only £100 of BTC use coinbase.

I think the stock market will crash with or without the presence of bitcoin for the reasons you have said.
The presence of bitcoin will then, in the event of a crash indeed be seen as a safe or appreciating commodity to move wealth into, causing a self-fulfilling surge. 
It's been a great run on the stock market so far but if you look, as you say, at valuations against profits, it appears to be speculation rather than valuation supporting the stocks. When will this pop? Who knows? Maybe 1-2years is my opinion. I will personally be withdrawing my entire stake in stocks and going to bitcoin, it pays to be the first mover (watch 'Margin Call'). 
Also another metric to look at is consumer and household debt, in some metrics this has already surpassed the previous peak, which was in 2007, just before the Great Recession. This, in my opinion will be the tinder to the fire. Curious to know what the spark will be... Brexit perhaps?
