Not bad, here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:51:22
Well yeah, obviously having a great business helps :) 
Not asking how to have a successful business, asking about how to get more people into bitcoin.
Assume I have all these things you mention (quality service, easy to use website, low prices, good support, reputation, etc).  I have happy customers and a great business, I'd just prefer them to spend bitcoin so I can make a little bit more money from reduction of fees.

Cool! Hadn't thought of things like this but "bitcoin people" like to see these types of things for sure. 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:48:14
Cool, this seems similar to the idea of making it easy for them to get bitcoin.  It's slightly different though as you're suggesting providing "help" material to help new users out and at the same time promote the discounts.  Thanks, here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:40:35
Cool idea! This would work much better for a brick-n-mortar shop than an online retailer but still decent idea. Here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 05:47:22
lol 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:44:54
Cool! I hadn't heard about LibertyX.  Seems like by also being able to sell small amounts of bitcoins to people might be a neat angle to add to a store.  Thanks here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:36:05
Love it! Great way to get new people into bitcoin. You don't even necessarily have to even accept bitcoin at your store to do this.  It's almost like a tip for spending at my store.  Here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 06:07:08
Yeah, had thought about most of these ideas but didn't want to seed too many into the discussion.  Cool thanks 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 05:09:41
Good point! Didn't even think of that. Here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 05:30:16
Not bad, though it costs $20/mo to list on gyft.  Here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:37:37
Yeah I'm not selling anything unique or products geared towards a "bitcoiner".  I'm not only looking for advice for myself just wanted to start a discussion about how merchants can help consumer adoption along.

Not so sure about the items available ONLY for bitcoin, seems like I might end up reducing my total sales.
Love the raffle idea though.  Cool campaign, here's 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 05:24:52
Cool, some good ideas in here.  Have 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-22 04:48:50
Can you elaborate? Do you mean offer a way for someone to refer bitcoin users to your store?
