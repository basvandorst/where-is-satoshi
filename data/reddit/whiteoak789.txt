Yeah I seen that coming about a year before it started ever really became apparent. Never kept more than $5 on that exchange.

Yeah I was kinda aggravated about this myself but the guy who used the handle as DPR was the original sysadmin so he doesn't run the site. But yeah I know what ya mean SR actually banned a lot after the site was up for a bit. But on a flip side they said it was invite only which SR was not. And there are a ton of darknet markets that do allow all the stuff that got listed. I wish they would have taken a different approach since SR was not like this. Well not once it implemented more strict policies.

Nice Wolf of Wall Street reference. Actually Jordan Belfort has some great interviews and speeches. He did one at Oxford that was really good.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:09:10
Needs more of them indicators.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:39:21
Ok so now give back that shit ton of money we gave you a few months ago since ya know your not using it anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:17:37
If I had more cash I would jump in but right now I just invest in future coins I fucked up with BTC and ETH I won't make that same mistake.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:22:02
FREE ROSS!! The man made a safer alternative to the drug market. I would much rather by shit off the DNM than the streets from some shady dope boy. At least on there I don't have to worry about being robbed/killed and I can view reviews and communicate with others. He revolutionized a industry that is not going away.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:26:00
There is no way I could work in a place that prints money she is making at most like $15-$20 an hour. And being around that much cash just makes bad thoughts happen. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 04:09:02
This is cool to see but this could get 100million signatures and it still wouldn't happen. This dude will never get out of prison they used him to make an example.
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:34:02
Ignorant reporters that have zero idea about what Bitcoin actually is. I like how they say the value could disappear yeah and that paper in your wallet's value can't please do not report on Bitcoin or anything related to finance again obviously you do not know anything about it.
@_date: 2015-11-25 06:32:40
Lmao bet he was pissed. Or he just powered off couldn't tell if he was a person or a machine by the way he was reading that script.

This is awesome we are defiantly going to mars screw the moon. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:06:04
Only exchange I leave any money in is btc-e been trading with them for years but If you do not trade then yeah defiantly cold storage for sure. I do it for the lulz of troll box to.
@_date: 2015-11-01 04:26:23
Yeah they have always been sketchy I usually just use them to purchase my alt coins and then transfer them out to my own wallet I never keep any coins on their. Or if I do it's not for long and no more than $20...
@_date: 2015-11-25 06:29:01
Well if this is the end luckily I only lost about $20 this has been another Gox waiting to happen. Exactly why I never kept more than $50 at one time on the site. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:09:20
Wow really is identical no complaints lets mooon I would like to see 2k this round.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:07:46
Ok and isn't that what we all love we sell and take profit then buy low and redo making us all more money. His logic makes zero sense.
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:25:07
If you are afraid to lose it don't put any into it. I am not a day trader by any means but have made some good money over the years trading every now and then. This hits it spot on. People rush to btc at it's high and put everything they have into it just be patient if it is mooning probably best to wait a few months or longer watch the market and buy when the price declines to a price you feel more suitable to buy in with your money. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 00:04:13
I think he means that if he reads more on what Bitcoin actually is he will agree it is a good idea. My opinion many intelligent people who manage though still won't want to pay in BTC even if they are aware of what it is. It cost them more of a headache unless they implement it for all employees as a alternative. Even then there is overhead and you can't really go to the bank and get a pay stub for BTC they could show that they bought and sent to a specific address. But the wallet address is not verification that it is that employees. There would be difficulties with regulation and how it is reported this is why it is not used more often unfortunately. Their are a ton more issues for employers perspective. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 01:41:42
Why because there would be a better monetary system? You would be selling the future BTC is a world wide game changer when it comes to currency.

Good Morning from east coast USA
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:47:38
I noticed this when I logged in this morning. At first I was like wait what kinda tripped me out. I like the new design although I think cryptothrift was just as effective. But change can be good bitify sound's more professional I suppose. Still the best crypto market place out there. 
I am with other's though the logo is confusing does not look like it spells Bitify.
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:37:37
Someone should let the martian know Btc is coming to get him.
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:03:30
I will be watching this PayPal does not typically care for change. Unless it greatly benefits them. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:08:39
Yeah gotta stay optimistic life would be sullen if I didn't try to. I think everyone needs to to some extent or another.
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:55:26
O I completely agree. But the fact is that sales of illicit substances will bring unwanted attention from agencies looking to shut it down. If they avoid that they could become the next Ebay but better and with more freedom to the market. Honestly the quicker they get away from PayPal the better. And moving into BTC will draw a more technical crowd allowing innovation to flourish.  
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:08:35
Mooon Then Mars when China wakes up.
@_date: 2015-10-21 01:38:14
Well they do really since they are affiliated with coinbase whenever you reach your purchase amount you get charged the fee for the purchase. And if you leave it at $6.00 default that's a good chunk of change literally for them.
@_date: 2015-10-21 00:40:54
I never knew about this app just set it up thanks for posting cool idea. I never realized it was affiliated with Coinbase or that they even had apps lmao. I like it i should have a a couple BTC in the next couple of weeks.
@_date: 2015-10-16 17:59:40
Why is this surprising it's the american justice system corrupt as all hell just like every other part of the government. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:11:33
Maybe some but ok like they never used cash before?? Cash will always be better than BTC. Cash doesn't have a digital ledger anyone can see. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 16:03:04
lmao this was a good laugh!
@_date: 2015-10-30 00:13:59
Yes I just want Btc to take over minus the tyranny aspect. I want the NWO of money and currency exchanges we need it it's time for a new system. Why not get rich off something it's an investment that's what you want. Money system is outdated and slowly going away if you look at Sweden as an example of that over i believe but don'e quote me on it 80% of transactions are digital already. So BTC is a new world changing thing that does money the way it should be done. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:21:02
This could be legitimate statement only thing they would really have to watch illicit things being sold otherwise it won't be taken as seriously but the day this opens will be revolutionary. 
However if Ebay does decide to accept BTC that could push the price to new highs and frankly that's good for anyone who is holding BTC. And the fact that would open up so many people who may not be familiar with BTC to become better acquainted with the technology. And that help's everyone the day i can go to any store and pay with BTC or any major retailer the world changes and this would be another huge step in that change. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:43:15
I knew I should have ordered a bigger box how will I ever store my Bitcoins now???
@_date: 2015-10-31 17:30:44
Yes Btc rains superior. All hail BTC 
@_date: 2015-10-22 23:10:39
It scares them because they can't control it and corrupt it to their own ends. Anything this government tries to get in on is only going to end badly.
If they start in on BTC to much the people who actually know about crypto will move to another alt currency undermining everything the government tries to control. We are the people we always find away around their corruption.
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:35:06
Hey if BTC is part of the New World Order I am all in with that.
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:08:57
Anyone who has ever mined will know this is not worthy of the price because you will never ever make the cost back let alone a profit.
@_date: 2016-07-17 23:13:16
Damn this looks awesome needed a new documentary on this.
@_date: 2016-07-16 17:08:55
This is why you send it to a few different addresses and then tumble them before final location takes a bit longer and small fees but worth the security.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:56:44
I am about to have to go to work and having a kinda shit day this made me laugh thanks OP.
