whats the easiest
bank deposit?  i see they have so many but if going to the bank is gonna save me 100$ etc...  
did you ever use another method like amazon etfc
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:16:34
i cant use coinbase because my ex used my credit card and i didnt know what it was and did a chargeback... so i am like banned for life.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:58:04
so - has anyone tried those things where you go to some generic bank - for example wells fargo and deposit money into a "broker" or someones account and take a pic of the receipt/license/selfie ... etc..  please if anyone has feedback let me know.  my other options involve driving 1 hr 45 min to an ATM
