Outgoing New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky released sweeping new rules for licensing virtual-currency businesses in the state Wednesday, staking part of his legacy on carving out regulatory oversight for an industry that many experts believe could transform the financial system.
Mr. Lawsky, who has said he will leave his post at the end of this month, announced the so-called BitLicense rules during a speech at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington.
The new rules, posted simultaneously on the Department of Financial Services’ website, require certain providers of virtual currency services operating in New York state—in particular, those with custody of customers’ funds and which exchange virtual currencies for dollars and other fiat currencies—to apply for a specially tailored DFS license. The regulation lays out a variety of specific conditions to keep that license up to date with regard to protections of consumers and anti-money-laundering compliance, capital adequacy, changes of ownership and cybersecurity.
Mr. Lawsky said it was necessary to create this first-of-its-kind regulation for virtual currencies because existing money-transmission laws date back to the Civil War and “simply wouldn’t work” for digital currency, a technology “unlike anything we had ever seen before.”
The BitLicense’s publication culminates an almost two-year draft-and-review process in which providers of bitcoin-based services occasionally locked horns with Mr. Lawsky over their fears that tougher regulation in the country’s most important financial hub could quash innovation in this nascent technology. The BitLicense is expected to become a template for other state financial regulators to follow.
But Mr. Lawsky, whose staff significantly moderated the terms of a much stricter first draft proposal released in July last year, argues that the revised version addresses many of the industry core concerns so as to carve out exemptions that create opportunities for innovators. He said it creates adequate rules that “help protect consumers and root out illicit activity,” but which seek not “to doom promising new technologies before they get out of the cradle.”
Running through five industry concerns with the BitLicense process, he said the final rules won’t require approval for standard software updates—only material changes to technology—and will only regulate intermediaries with custody of customer funds, not software developers. He said licensees that want both a BitLicense and a traditional money-transmitter license won’t have to duplicate the application process, and that there will be no need to file “suspicious activity reports,” or SARs, when these anti-money-laundering actions have already been handled by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. Finally, investor changes will only require approval when an investor gains control over the management and policies of the firm.
Mr. Lawsky did, however, reject industry arguments that DFS should leave anti-money-laundering requirements to FinCEN. “Again, we recognize that we are not going to please everyone,” he said.
The new law may not placate Mr. Lawsky’s toughest critics in the industry, many of whom have never forgiven him for the combative stance with which he opened this process, delivering subpoenas to numerous bitcoin businessmen in August 2013. Some are angered by what they see as a conflict of interest as New York’s top regulator plans a new career providing consulting services, including advice on the virtual-currency industry.
New York’s top financial regulator “will be able to use the name he made attacking Bitcoin to wend his way into the Bitcoin business world,” wrote Jim Harper, a fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and the former Global Policy Counsel at the industry advocacy group the Bitcoin Foundation, in a blog post last month.
New York Department of Financial Services spokesman Matthew Anderson said critics “have their facts wrong” in describing Mr. Lawsky’s new firm as a “bitcoin consultancy.” It “will be focused on compliance, crisis management, cybersecurity, and other issues” and may not do any work related to bitcoin, he said. Mr. Anderson added that, based on government service rules Mr. Lawsky cannot provide advice related to the DFS. If any client wants advice on getting a BitLicense, he said, the outgoing superintendent “cannot and will not do that. Period.”
The BitLicense comes as Wall Street firms are increasingly expressing interest in incorporating bitcoin’s core technology, a digital ledger known as the blockchain, into the back-office and payment functions of the financial system. Exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group has launched a pilot program to use the blockchain to handle how certain securities are transferred settled among investors, for example, the New York Stock Exchange has invested in Coinbase, a bitcoin services provider that has launched a high-tech digital-currency exchange, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has led a venture funding round in bitcoin consumer service provider Circle Internet Financial.

Come on buddy, I totally understand where your coming from as I love Bitcoin.
But in reality, new people that come into the system are not going to know how to look after their own keys so things like Bitreserve are a good opportunity for new people to get involved. 
It's like saying oh no my bank has all my money and they can do what they want with it, which is true but the reason we need them is for things like debit card payments, direct debits etc.
When people/businesses/institutions can build on top of API's like Bitreserve then we can keep all of our 'money' on Bitreserve, or you can keep say 10 BTC on your own private key and send BTC when you need to pay bills.
I would much rather have my disposable income on Bitreserve once they have built up trust and they have the correct regulations in place and have audits. Rather than putting it in the bank and letting the bank loan out my money at 10% fractional reserve.

No bitcoins are physical? They are just virtual entries on the ledger.
The password protected private key I think falls under BIP38 - basically allowing you to have an extra level of security on your private key, so if you want to import it then you must put in that passhprase.
However your public key has no need to be password protected as it's just like your house address. Everyone knows its there but no one can get in without the private key. Therefore even if someone gets your magical private key they will still need the passphrase on top to open it.
I would not advise sending anyone your private key that you don't trust.

The bitcoin startup that hired former Nike CIO Anthony Watson has now added the sportswear giant’s security chief, William Dennings, to its ranks. The move comes amid a lawsuit between Nike, Mr. Dennings and his former employer, MasterCard International, that highlights the fierce battle for top cybersecurity talent.
Mr. Dennings joined Bitreserve this month as the startup’s first CISO, Mr. Watson said in a statement on the company’s website. There, Mr. Dennings will “spearhead the company’s security and data protection infrastructure,” the statement said.

Prior to joining Nike, Mr. Dennings was chief information security officer at MasterCard.
The credit card company sued Nike in January, alleging that the sportswear company conspired with Mr. Dennings and another security manager, Ryan Fusselman, to poach cybersecurity talent. The suit claims that both executives, who joined Nike in 2013, broke non-solicitation agreements and non-disclosure contracts by subsequently hiring MasterCard employees who worked in information security.
MasterCard filed new charges in March, claiming ongoing IT damages. Among the new allegations, MasterCard said Mr. Dennings “reconfigured Nike’s network to resemble that of MasterCard using MasterCard’s confidential information.” The credit card company has demanded at least $5 million in damages.
The amended complaint also adds details about the colleagues allegedly lured away – eight key employees in MasterCard’s 135-member information security department.
Nike plans to file a motion to dismiss the suit this week, a company spokesperson told CIO Journal.
The lawsuit and executive move underscores the competitive landscape around cybersecurity talent. Skilled, experienced CISOs are in high demand, said Craig Stephenson, managing director of the North American CIO practice at executive recruiter Korn Ferry. “Firms across all industries are being stressed every single day to make sure information is protected. You need an individual with the ability to deal with dynamic situations,” Mr. Stephenson said.
Mr. Stephenson declined to speculate on the executive movement between MasterCard, Nike and Bitreserve. However, he said, companies looking to lure experienced security leaders offer 20% to 40% compensation boosts. “We spend a lot of time with clients making sure they stay close to the individual in that role,” he said. “Compensation, visibility, whatever it takes to make sure that individual is happy.”
Mr. Watson, now Bitreserve’s president and COO, left Nike in December after less than a year with the company, citing personal reasons.
Founded by Internet entrepreneur Halsey Minor, Bitreserve is a cloud-based financial platform that lets users access, hold and move currencies and commodities without traditional banks. The company is responsible for $13 million of transactions globally, its website says.
“I’m excited to join Bitreserve at a time when the company is establishing itself as a leading cloud money service,” Mr. Dennings said in the statement. “Information security extends well beyond IT and customer service in the global payments sector. It’s vital to the secure, instant, easy and free movement of money that Bitreserve offers our members.”

Bitcoin Core initial sync can take a long time. You should make sure that you have enough bandwidth and storage for the full block chain size (over 20GB). If you know how to download a torrent file, you can speed up this process by putting bootstrap.dat (a previous copy of the block chain) in the Bitcoin Core data directory before starting the software.

Not much I agree.
"Or cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which operate outside of the realm of financial regulation and monetary policy frameworks, powered organically by a sprawling network of dedicated developers and enthusiasts."
However it expresses the thought of the younger generation quite perfectly and ties into what Bitcoin is all about.

I see a future with multiple coins co-exisiting. I have recently been following NodeCoin and this allows for pretty much instant confirmation. It is built using Node.js and uses connected nodes to authorise transaction, if you complete the block you are rewarded via something called "forging".  
I see Bitcoin as a store of high value and then this value can be exchanged for other coins for day to day spending. It's exciting times to see what will happen in the next 2-3 years as I see a finanical crisis is imminent - look what happened on Tuesday with the ruble etc. Oil going down... It's all linked.

Im just saying, integrating the bitcoin protocol into whatsapp to make it easier to send your friends money. People are lazy and dont want to keep swapping between apps.
If people see how easy it can be by integrating it into apps like this then they are more likely to adopt it.

Good luck with this, it sounds like a great idea.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:33:18
They would have to shut down every running node. It's not just one computer that they can hit, this is the positive of the whole system being decentralised.
Take for example the piratebay has recently been shut down, thats because it was all based around one signle point of failure. If the piratebay was decentralised then they would have had to raid every node on earth that was hosting it.
On the other hand if Governments start to make it illegal to own bitcoin then it becomes trickier to keep as people don't want to be against the law. But to me thats like when America stopped Americans from holding gold and will not happen again.

@_date: 2015-01-03 17:36:09
From what I understand that is coming from their test node, however the bandwith does not need to be paid for as the normal client server method.
Its basically 1000's of clients that will all be interconnected sharing the files to you, think of how bit torrent works. It's all peer to peer.
The file is encrypted on 3 or more computers running metadisk and then when your request the file you give the key and it downloads and decrypts the file.
In the future I could see media files being streamed but I would imagine that will be much further down the line.

@_date: 2015-01-05 14:31:09
Take a look at 
Bitreserve are doing this in real time. They are also using multi sig to store coins. It's not as per say a trading exchange but you are able to swap coins for other currencies.

@_date: 2015-01-03 17:32:52
Your cutting out the middleman, this will cut costs on things like labour. The blockchain is basically an automated programable central institution which is why storj will be cheaper than the likes of dropbox.

I think it was a ridiculously lucky shot to be honest, it's the first time I have ever used a telescrope lol. The Celestron 130 EQ and used my iPhone 6 camera and then made it look abit better in instagram.
With Storj.io I remember reading about it months back but have just had a look this morning and they are running their beta so I thought I would test it out and it worked seamlessly. I think im going to buy into storj.io so I can start 'farming' with some spare storage I have.
App's like this show the potential of the blockchain I think. Imagine having an important file that needed permission of 2/3 people to view it, you could use multi-sig for this. 
This is a cool video -

BitReserve is currently doing all this. Added multi-sig and have quartlerly financial reviews etc.
They are not as per say a trading exchange but you can swap your BTC for things like USD, GBP, EUR, GOLD etc.

Cash should still be full value - If the user was going to pay by card instead of Bitcoin you would still be taking a hit.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:50:50
The estimate is 2140 based on the block reward halving frequency of four years. According to math and knowledge that there are 32 halving events, in 2136, the block reward will yield 0.00000168 BTC per day, which is 0.00000042 BTC per block. That's 42 satoshis.
It's arguable that there could be one additional halving, to a block reward of 0.00000021 BTC, but that would require a major protocol modification since the number of Bitcoin would then exceed 21 million. Additionally, to go past that, there'd have to be a protocol modification to extend divisibility past eight decimal places. It is far, far to early to worry about either of these, because we're more than a century away from this problem.

I definitely agree but is is of comparable value to $2.5m USD. However the market isn't that liquid yet and would crash the price if your tried to sell them for fiat.

To be a verified member for free forex and free transfers of all the different currencies between members you need to give them your ID etc.
However you can do some stuff without but I think once you hit a limit you have to supply the details for AML/KYC.
As far as I know, everytime you want to make an online purchase you will link the visa card to say your USD/GBP/EUR/BTC card and be able to use it for that one transaction.
Therefore you would never have to worry about people charging your card again, or having your card details for fraud.

Thanks, I have never really looked too much into the mining process in its entirety. However what your basically saying is if all the 'connected' nodes with full blockchain + the miners with the full blockchain move over to XT and there is I think a 75%(??) consensus on XT then we will hard fork?

This is because these devices sign the transaction in a secure environment on the actual device. The device can never communicate with the Internet.
It goes something like this

Im talking the early days when we went from standard Nokia 3210's to things like the Sony Ericssons like T610 which had smarter apps to things like the Nokia N-GAGE but these sort of phones were high end at the time.
Then the killer phone the iPhone and all it's apps came out for hundreds of use cases... This was soon followed by mass adoption in the developed world. We are also seeing mass adoption in the developing world now where Bitcoin will hopefully become ubiquitous.

Bitcoin, the volatile digital currency, cannot help the Greeks of today. But it could mean a great deal to those caught up in currency crises to come.
Greece’s fundamental problem is that it cannot work its way out of its financial hole the way just about every other country outside the eurozone would: by printing money, and in the process making its goods and labor cheaper. With a freeze on transfers of funds out of the country and a daily limit on how many euros Greeks can withdraw from the bank, there is a very real threat that countless Greek businesses will go bankrupt and Greece’s people could become unable to buy the basic necessities of everyday life.
For the average Greek, getting one’s hands on bitcoin requires buying it with euros—the last thing any sane Greek would give up. That’s why the bitcoin of today has no bearing on what could easily become a humanitarian crisis.
But Bitcoin is at an inflection point, and it’s evolving much more quickly than all but its most dedicated observers realize. Whatever happens to bitcoin itself, the technology underlying it opens up previously unimagined possibilities for the future of just about anything humans exchange.
You don’t have to take my word for it. Hardly a week goes by that a large institution doesn’t announce its interest in bitcoin, whether it’s the chief information officer at UBS saying it could lead to “massive simplification” of banking, or the Bank of England declaring it will someday have “far-reaching implications.” Deloitte recently issued a report on the potential for state-sponsored cryptocurrencies as an alternative to conventional money, and even Nasdaq is testing bitcoin technology for use on its stock exchange.
Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s former finance minister, proposed on his blog more than a year ago that if Greece wanted to create its own currency to replace the euro, it could use the technology of bitcoin to create a currency that he called “Future Taxes” coin, the value of which would be guaranteed by future tax revenue taken in by the government.

If the idea of Greece rapidly switching to an alternate currency seems ridiculous, consider that it is happening already. In Greece, companies are doing what they often do in times of currency crisis, which is paying suppliers and employees in IOUs, or scrip, which are promises to pay back a debt as soon as the banks unlock a firm’s money.
I asked Michael Casey, the senior adviser to the MIT Media Lab on cryptocurrencies—and until recently, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal—whether or not the technology underlying bitcoin, known as the blockchain, could be used to issue this scrip.
Absolutely, he assured me, and the mechanism might be a new technology called “sidechains.”
To understand sidechains, it helps to know how bitcoin itself works. Broadly, transactions are recorded on a main digital ledger, called the blockchain, which is like any other account of transfers going back to the clay tablets that recorded pharaoh’s stores of grain.
Bitcoin’s ledger isn’t processed or stored by one central body. Rather, it is distributed across a global network of computers, some of which are granted an economic incentive to keep the whole system running. Owing to this and other characteristics of bitcoin, no one on the system has to trust anyone else, neither a central transactional authority or the person sending them bitcoin, for the system to work. No third-party verification of the transfer of bitcoin takes place, nor is it needed. Not only is this system potentially faster than current forms of digital transactions, it could also be a lot cheaper.
On top of this basic protocol, there are a host of proposals to modify bitcoin to let anyone use it for pretty much any transaction, including signing contracts, issuing stock, and representing any kind of currency, from U.S. dollars to frequent-flier miles. Sidechains are arguably the leading contender among these proposals.
But that’s just the start. Because bitcoin is becoming not a currency unto itself but a protocol, like the communications protocol that makes the Internet possible, as well as a platform, like Apple’s app store, the kinds of transaction systems developers could build on top of it are limited only by our imaginations.
One idea, says Mr. Casey, is that Greece could create a “collateralized currency” backed by state-owned assets. Cryptocoins representing a fraction of all the country’s islands, ports and factories would hold their value as long as people believe the underlying assets do.
Thinking even further into the future, it isn’t hard to imagine a way to use digital tokens to permanently institutionalize the last resort in all currency crises—barter.
“The reason why barter was flawed is you can’t cut a horse in half in return for a bunch of arrowheads or whatever,” says Mr. Casey. But crypto-tokens that individually represent a portion of an asset are infinitely divisible, he says, and “if you have infinitely divisible claims on an asset, then you could trade a third of a horse for a trip to Acapulco.”
If that sounds a lot like the abstraction known as money that is at the root of Greece’s problems, you can appreciate that no technology can solve poor planning or badly designed systems. That said, the most exciting thing about bitcoin’s blockchain technology is that it has the potential to democratize how money is created. And that, for many observers, is fundamentally what the debate over Greece and the fate of the entire European Union is about.

I finish my degree in a few months and thinking about travelling around Asia and going to stay in New Zealand for a while with the thought of living there in the future.
I too love travelling and if everywhere in the world accepted BTC at every merchant system it would be so so easy for people city hopping, rather than having to worry about certain exchange rates, if the ATM will work, if it swallows your card etc. The innovation surrounding Bitreseve makes me excited as it has the possibility to become the truly 'cloud' banking system where you could hold any currency and pay with your originating currency i.e GBP in any country in the world with very little fees.
I have hit 21 BTC now and i'm waiting eagerly with anticipation over what the next couple of years is going to bring, there is alot of very talented people in this area at the moment and with the financial markets going the way they are at the moment it make it a very interesting space to watch.

Upload from your bank account and exchange different currencies for 0%
"Bitreserve is on Wednesday re-branding as Uphold and opening up its platform to the mainstream.
Until today its digital wallets could only be stocked with bitcoin (although this could be converted to 24 currencies). But now Uphold now lets you upload cash from traditional bank accounts and credit cards across 33 European countries, including the UK. US, and Chinese accounts will be available in November.
Aside from storing money online, Uphold's big selling point is it lets you transfer internationally and switch between currencies for free."
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:26:45
No messing about with converting to euro etc.
You get your IBAN number from the bank and put that into uphold to link your account and do what it requests and then send money to their sort code and account number. I think they're using SEPA but I didn't experience any charges, I sent £50 from my Lloyds account to my GBP card and within 2 days I received £50 in my uphold account and exchanged this for BTC on their site for 0%.
However with a visa debit card it was instant. I think if you use a credit card however you may be liable for the handling fee.

It would be a fun little project and of cause you would have to scale it at first and have less tickets but it would just be a constant ongoing phase.
However you would have to make sure it wasn't a ponzi scheme and this could be done through the blockchains ledger. The issues is around who controls the funds. You could have something ridiculous like 7 of 10? and involve people like blockchain.info, coinbase, btc foundation etc as trustees to release the funds to the winner.

"The US government is now drowning in debt that can never be repaid. The US government’s own numbers, in fact, estimate its level of insolvency at roughly $60 trillion. This means that when you add up all the assets of the United States—every acre of land, every tank, every drone, every drop of oil in the strategic reserve… and subtract all the debt and liabilities, the result is MINUS $60 trillion." - Zerohedge

Okay, as you have a GUI if you go to something like tools and then debug you should be able to get alot more data, there should also be a list of the commands you can use.

The quickest way to become a node is to download the bitcoin client and let it sync the blockchain.
Being a node means you have the blockchain and are able to join the decentralised network that is Bitcoin. You can relay transactions etc.

"A universal value transfer standard would also be required: the paper says the equivalent of HTTP for money will be needed and that setting up such a platform on which digital currency apps could operate would be very, very complex."

I understand exactly what you mean, once bitcoin is adopted for many new applications every sataoshi is going to be in demand.

I wouldn't ever wish it upon anyone, I just think from looking at the state of the economy at the moment it's inevitable within the next decade. I just hope everyone that is able to comes out on the right side of it. :)

A fairer currency for the world if it was ever possible. Taking away the power away from the American dollar.
It would be the ideal currency for global trade as it could be valued like gold used to be.

"When I started CNET everyone talked about HTML, telnet, gopher, usenet, FTP, etc. When I left CNET in 2000 few people spoke of these terms. Importantly very few people used FTP software in 2000, but millions of people used CNET Download.com each day as a service.
We went from a world where few people used the Internet and all referenced the technologies of the Internet to today where most everyone uses the Internet but few speak of its technologies. That shows consumer adoption.
At Bitreserve we want to revolutionize money the same way at CNET we revolutionized content and Salesforce.com software. We want EVERYONE to use digital currency, including "consumers" and especially the unbanked. I think we all share the same mission so let's not pick at each other when we still have a very long way to go to make this revolution real in the world."
