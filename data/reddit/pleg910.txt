If for some reason you are in need of the 1,000 dollars, by all means cash out, but I’d wait until Sunday (right before the futures thing starts and anything could happen). If you don’t absolutely need it then HODL

Coinbase to GDAX. No fees with stop orders on GDAX right? I think that’s what I read. How quickly do order with GDAX show up in your wallet?

Great advice, thank you

I’d love to trust you but you’ve given me very little to go off of. Could you elaborate?

Right, but I can’t buy without first selling because I won’t have enough capital on hand for it to be prudent. Sounds like you think I should just leave it alone in this case.

Could someone ELI5 important takeaways?

So not necessarily a bad strategy, but instead of watching the ticker I should set buyorders? Or are you saying it’s a bad strategy overall.

Wow I actually learned about this but completely forgot about it going into the weekend. Will not be selling.

Ok, thanks for taking the time. I’d only sell an amount that I’d be willing to risk having to buy back at a higher price (or not at all). Since I’m so new to this and buying and selling through the exchanges is so unreliable I think I’m just gonna HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:59:34
Ok cool. Now I definitely don’t trust you.

Thanks for taking the time!

If you’re using the app and having this problem try going to the website instead. That worked for me.
