This wouldn't be MtGox's second chance; this would be the **forth** chance.

Please be careful when flying with Bitcoin.  It is value and if known you will get brought in for questioning. 
It's a bad idea to fly with 10,000 in USD, just as it's a bad idea to fly with 20+ BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:25:13
Bitcoind transactions less than $600 worth of value are not included.  Please stop spreading this misinformation.

I remember these post happening at the first drop from 100, and from 10...  This doesn't mean jack shit to a majority of us as we are in it for the long haul.

What did you expect from me?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:51:18
I use a bitcoin allowance of which I can spend or save.  Just set-up a weekly recurring buy and use that as spending coins; anything left after a week send to a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:18:55
It's giving the same power most people give PayPal. 
I use coinbase a lot with no issue. Safe as you can find I'd guess.

Given the current speed of progress, supercomputers are projected to reach 1 exaFLOPS (EFLOPS) in 2019

A quick estimate of this set-up:
Coins per 24h at these conditions	0.0015 BTC
Power cost per 24h	0.36 USD
Revenue per day	1.19 USD
Just sayin'

You loose 15% but gain the ability to use cash and never need to provide real identity info.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:41:28
I like you.

What  I see is a lot of 'Don'ts' and 'Not's" to this and that; What about what TO post?

He's just making 3 million dollar paper wallets to give out as Christmas "I told you-so's" to all the people he loves. 
Like most of us making gifts last minute.

Sorry Dude.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:10:09
Truth hurts to some people eh? I don't see the reason for these downvotes; china's bitcoin market is essentially built off this thought.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:37:03
Yea just like that crash back in April that totally whipped all possible vitality that bitcoin had, right?
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:30:44
You could already buy a gyft card with more than that on it ;)

There is no trust needed; the miners create the blockchain the server just host it.

17 gigs of torrents downloaded from bitfetch?

Actually the last week there was a 2% gain. 
You maybe refering to the ~12.5% loss we've had over this month. 
Which is meaningless when you think of the 600+% gain we have had over the year and ~16,000% over the last two. 
Fuck 3 million loss over a week; he's turned *basically* nothing into millions a two short years. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:26:24
Mine litecoins instead; also @_date: 2013-12-07 01:50:04
DO NOT SELL
Unless you want to of course.

Do you feel like you were late to the party?

This video is quite misleading and the publisher obviously doesn't know much about wallets.  You don't need to download the blockchain to participate in bitcoin.

Very cool and perfect idea for any band on a tour!

Ahem, I think alot of sheep users would like their coins back. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:15:16
Step one: Buy Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:45:59

I've done just that like digtalh3rmit says.

Every time people ask the response is localbitcoins.com. 
I want the old BitInstant back too, but it's not going to happen.  
This is the new world of bitcoin. You will need to identify in order to buy from large 'dispensary' due to the whole gox getting in trouble for being a money transfer service. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:11:28
All of them but litecoin and namecoin.
@_date: 2013-09-02 03:26:09
Stop trusting others with your money. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:45:27
Some view litecoin as another way to get bitcoin.  However with enough people wanting to have the chance of a "ride" there will be enough speculation in the market to harbor growth.  Unstable growth? Who knows.  
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:56:27
Crazy to think this after only a few years they have gone from basically valueless to 1 BTC being one of the most valued currency in the world.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:53:08
Our story has just begun.  Goodbye speculator! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:13:30
I find there is tons of things I would like to buy online but not use my credit card and name to purchase. BTC is perfect for me! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:36:06
Go to coinbase.com instead for the bee knees in bitcoin buying.
