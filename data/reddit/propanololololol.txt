I thought this we care about the value of a coin's technology itself, not the team or community behind it.

Not really. You comment went over so much that there's a lot of relevant ties to these questions.
Thanks for your answers. I can't sympathise with you at all on the Taiwan issue, and I feel that your justification for the situation HK is heavily motivated by that. But I do agree with you that reactionary policing is generally ok. However, I've also seen many cases of police attacking peaceful protesters; just because there are violent protests ongoing elsewhere doesn't justify that.

So do you believe that the police actions against protestors are justified? And do you believe that the Taiwanese independence movement should be quashed in the same way?

I agree with you that money works best, but I don't see why a specific currency tied solely to the project would be any better. If the end product isn't worth it, people will stop using it anyway and it will fall apart even with a specific currency for the project - that's just a failed venture.

I think it's important to talk things like this out. Especially since we'll probably have many more conversations like this with others in the future.

Blockchain computing is the future of many projects. This can be achieved without attaching a currency.

Make a project where the motivation to validate blocks is to run the app or whatever the end result of the project is. Use of a token could be replaced by, for example, time spent contributing to the network. I feel like a cryptocurrency is arbitrary. For example, projects on a private blockchain (e.g. those on your home devices network or those implemented between partnered businesses) wouldn't benefit whatsoever from an extra cryptocurrency.

Use of a product that does something you need is a reward in itself, no? I do understand what you mean for general cases, it's the whole reason money exists after all. Just a lot of them don't need a coin to propel the network. Subscription-based services could be just as useful.
