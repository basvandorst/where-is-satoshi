its better than trusting the media that are owned by banks.

sending bitcoin functions very similarly to sending USD on Venmo. User to User except with Bitcoin theres no middle man. People also imply that when they speak about bitcoin they are already using one of many wallets or exchanges that allows them to send or receive, since you wanted to nitpick. We all know how Venmo and Bitcoin work in this subreddit. 
I absolutely disagree with you, depending on where in the world you live consumers would absolutely want to have monetary sovereignty rather than putting trust in a bank. The thing is judging by your answer you probably have the luxury of living in a western country with a relatively stable banking system, where consumers feel safe keeping their money with an institution. 
Try telling half the world (just to name a few: Venezuela, China, Turkey, Argentina, Greece, African countries etc.) how they would feel putting their money in a bank only to find out a couple months later the government in power took a haircut of deposits or frozen them completely because the "dear leader" decides its necessary.
Crypto will kill the debt based economy and loans in the future will be directly peer-to-peer no need for a central party. 
Perhaps in the western world where people just want their crypto safe and they trust the banks they would use custodial solutions. However as time goes by and easier solutions develop my gut tells me most people will be sovereign citizens. People will get fed up of the typical "Did you send the wire?" calls bank after waiting 30min on hold "I'm sorry the compliance department is going over the transaction"

Completely agree.
