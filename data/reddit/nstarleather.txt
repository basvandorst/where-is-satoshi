I mean, chances are, it’s not wonderful quality due to the price...I actually had a similar strap get destroyed in a matter of weeks...my main thing is the “genuine is the lowest grade”, isn’t based in any real system or terminology in industry.   It was basically made up by a dude who’s main selling point is using full grain leather, and while his products do last, the leather is squarely from a “middle of the road” tannery.

So this isn't actually true...[legally in the USA anything labeled "Leather" or "Genuine leather" does have to mean real in addition it also can't be bonded.](  Legally speaking, genuine leather is a really really broad term that can mean just about anything from really good full grain to a "low quality leather called a finished split.
I’ve worked with leather my entire life for a company my dad started in 1969.
**This idea of "leather grades" is probably the most widespread myth in my industry, it's simply not a "real" grading system used by any authority (government, leather trade group, or otherwise).**
There are plenty of manufacturers who put "Genuine Leather" on high quality (full grain in many cases) leather; Red Wing Heritage being a good example (I've also seen it stamped on a full grain, made in UK, belt from LL Bean). Even when it is “bad leather” it’s not always the same type of bad leather. You can’t call up a tannery and ask for “genuine leather” and expect them think you're talking about something specific.
It'd be like if you asked a butcher if an amazing cut of Kobe Beef was "100% Real Beef"...although you'd typically see that kind of label on a box of taco meat (or worse), it doesn't mean that the fancy steak isn't also "100% real beef". A butcher probably has 1000 other adjectives to describe kinds and cuts of steak, but it's still all "100% real beef". I'm a leather worker and have hundreds of ways to describe different pieces of real leather...but it's all "genuine leather."
Yeah...when the price point is low and they don't give a further explanation as to the type of leather, it's not likely to be the absolute best quality. But it's a mistake to think you're getting a specific low-grade leather when you see "genuine."
At it’s most basic you have just 2 real types of leather everything else is just a variation: 
**Leather** (aka top grain) is the outside (the smooth part)
**Suede** has 2 fuzzy sides because it’s split from the bottom of the top grain.
After that leather can be full grain (nothing done to the top), corrected grain aka sanded, and embossed. Some leathers can be both sanded and embossed. Just sanded leather is know as nubuck. Sanded and then finished is known as corrected grain (usually). There are hundreds of variations on embossed patterns.
You can go further into finishes and other qualities: waxed, pull-up, pigmented, aniline, semi aniline. Plus loads more.
Leather that retains its smooth side but that’s used for the “suede side” is known as Roughout, full grain suede, or reverse.
With suede there are less variations. Mainly how fuzzy it is (how much nap). They can also wax suede. The “bad” kind of suede is called a finished split. Finished splits (painted or pu coated) are bad because they are attempts to make fuzzy leathers look like smooth top grain; the “fake” outer layer doesn’t last.
With all of these except the finished split, no one of these types is really any “better” than others. If they are from a good tannery, any type of leather and even suede will last almost the same regardless. Conversely something that people generally used to associate with quality like full grain, won't be as good as a non-full grain leather from a lesser tannery.
**TLDR: There are high end tanneries that deal in all of these types (it's incorrect to call them grades) of leather and also “low end tanneries” that can do any of these “types." Which is why saying that these differences (grades) are a reliable way to judge quality is incorrect.**
