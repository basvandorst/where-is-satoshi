Wall Street employees get their huge bonuses on the 18th and a large portion is expected to get pumped into crypto. Could be interesting..

Is it too early for a moon meme?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:51:25
Bitcoin created so many economic experts it's amazing.

!remind me 20 days
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:06:30
That's not what we say around these parts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:57:23
I would wait another week. It's been chaotic since friday
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:27:25
Don't fall into the McAfee coin of the day trap. Gets pumped by bots before you can get a chance
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:04
The strange tingling in my balls.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:14:11
The faith people have in it is also incredible. It could leave you for broke at the drop of a pin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:41

Anyone else get the feeling that the "Euphoria" is over and now we're all on a massive come-down?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:34:47
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:19

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:42:34
Need to get through this wall first though
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:26:00
I like binance but limited selection of alt coins
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:32:44
People have coded a bot to automatically read his Twitter post then buy up loads of the coin, pumping before anyone gets a chance to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:30:37
That's pretty much what we do here
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:30:49
Bitcoin to $28.5k by midnight GMT
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:56:55
Thank you father bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:27
Look at the profiles on coinbase for BTC, Eth and LTC, they're almost identical!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:47:22
Now is still a good time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:35:06
Have a look at NXT, that's where I would put my money now if I was going to invest in altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:03
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:57:58
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:51:01
Big dip incoming, time to panic buy..
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:51:21
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:21:03

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:44:39
Reach its peak for the day now
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:17:00
It's a small investment so I would personally keep it on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:16:00
youtube is an excellent resource. Plenty of tutorials on there. You will be an expert overnight
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:21:56

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:25:07
He's a troll
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:10:30
28.5 is my prediction before the new year arrives
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:29:50
If someone offered you a choice between $10mil in cash or bitcoin for free BUT you couldn't touch it for 5 years, which would you choose?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:06:04
Predictions for tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:12:03
So pleased I managed to get in at 12k now. Looked like I was going to be taking a loss for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:25:26

And boy is it moist.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:23:20
Back to our day jobs then.. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:25:14
What a full day for bitcoin it's been
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:33:06
I'm sorry but you can't compare the volatility of bitcoin to the dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:58
Who's buying in before the 18th? Not sure whether to wait and see what happens first.. could go either way.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:30:02
Wild day
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:53:13
I work around the corner from their registered office in London. Id be trashing their place by now if it was my money.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:10:18
