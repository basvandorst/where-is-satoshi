Yeah I am holding, but want to keep buying but timing the market is impossible

How low till buy though, that’s the question

No. A bank stores fiat. An exchange is NOT meant to hold your crypto although people do.

That is not true 100%. Tomorrow (sundays) candle close is critical. If we close at or above 9600 or so than 7500 is unlikely. You may get another small dip to establish a new low, but closing higher than 9600 gives me confidence that we are on a rebound. We also tried testing 8000 last night with heavy resistance

Not facts to back this. If you are referring to the stock market than wrong. Media fuddinf DOW by saying it was the most points fallen since 2008. The difference? In 2008 that’s a 10% drop while this was only 2.5%. Perspective is key. DOW is still up 3% in 2018. Like crpto, a healthy correction is key when you grow at such stupid rates.
With that said, btc needs to close Sunday’s daily charts at or above 9600 to confidently say we are in a rebound. If not, testing lows next week is realistic

Keep an eye on Sunday’s candle and where it closes. If it closes above 9600 then I think the rebound can safely be called...if not than we will probably test lows

None of the bounces have had the volume to be sustained though like this. Regaining 50% if the candle + substantial volume is typically a tell for rebound. With crypto anything can happen though. Tether calling the bluff and saying they will release audit will assist

Bold statement without any facts to support it

The stock markets? Crypto markets do not close. There has not been a proven correlation with the US traditional market and crypto market
