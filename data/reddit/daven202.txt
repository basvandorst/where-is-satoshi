If you’re buying less than full bitcoins this increase isn’t important

Tribalism. Nobody is free of it. Seems to be intrinsic to human nature. It’s so hard to see in yourself though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:57:58
Or a giant pump and dump
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:21:33
Would be a stupid thing to do. Houses will always have value unless someone kills 6 billion people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:32
Lol just seen that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:06:54
All this says to me is it’s the work of god. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:15
Well. Normally I’d agree with the sceptic. However... this is convenient as fuck.
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:11:19
Either buy and be prepared to wait a few years or day trade. Constantly saying that you’ve lost money doesn’t help
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:10:35
I live in China. I can confirm, it’s super strict, they check that every penny is taxed is you’re a laowai. They really don’t want you to take money out. And they really don’t want you to have extra income. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:09:06
I’ve been hearing it since $300... 
@_date: 2018-08-31 11:55:47
I will never let a sink into the room unless necessary!
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:02:13
Well last August was the start of the craziness. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 21:03:32
Omg $moon SoOn$¥$?!

Buy a Mac
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:39:07
These sales attempts that end in—bought Bitcoin, suck. Bitcoin has value but it’s not going to replace real currency. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:52:21
What about all the countries that don’t have crazy socialists running them or foreign powers trying to royalty fuck them? Their fiat is doing alright.
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:54:16
Your brain is working.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:11:16
That country can barely afford a normal bank. I wouldn’t deposit a thing in a place like that.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:31:13
Somebody I can talk to, someone that I can kiss. The feeling of wind on my face, the smell of sea water in my lungs, and dreams in my head. The feeling of uncertainty about what the day might bring! The great works of man and of Mother Nature! And filthy porn.
@_date: 2019-11-19 04:37:09
9/11 confirmed?!?!
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:11:17
And then your dick will start working again
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:12:11
People are overly enthusiastic about such strange things... I guess people need something to feel passionate about.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:06:52
Bitcoin has only existed for a few month to most people. In their world the sky has fallen.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:12:51
That’ll teach’em
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:39:46
Look at the picture of the flashy car! Is that not reason enough to hold?! It could be you driving that! All it needs is another picture of a handsome guy in a suit looking like he’s contemplating the universe or thinking about starting a business while a hot chick serves him a drink. Oh with a beautiful city skyline in the background. Then I’ll definitely read the article. One day that’ll be me if I stay in Crypto...
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:34:33
Never 
@_date: 2019-10-09 08:00:38
This whole sub has been asking that question for years.
@_date: 2019-10-17 06:57:13
I’m old. I’ve seen this many times
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:57:47
Nothing makes me happier than mass suffering and hyperinflation! Bring on the Bitcoin revolution baby!
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:10:46
This stuff makes me bearish.
@_date: 2019-10-21 01:27:52
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:05:24
That’s a lolocaust!
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:47:28
Those guys need a miracle. Their country went tits up.
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:59:41
OMG! WTF?! FLM!? Maybe. But does it matter?????? 
@_date: 2019-02-13 08:58:19
Sayyyy whaaatttttttttt!?!!
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:43:26
He also said it has problems like the energy usage...
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:18:07
You mean speculation.
@_date: 2019-02-25 08:02:10
Good to see blockchain being put to good use.
@_date: 2019-02-13 09:12:17
Real estate?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:59:06
Bitcoin cash isn’t a bad coin... however I am dubious of the creators intentions. The lower fees thing is great but I think rather than being true to the original vision of Bitcoin, the creators instead are using brand recognition to syphon money into their pockets. I mean the only reason to use the Bitcoin name is because of brand recognition. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:24:28
Up to you 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:20:17
As long as you were will to lose money it’s fine to invest

Thanks guy with the ape in his profile.

0 is the absolute bottom
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:13:13
Fucking tools. Tools to make me richer that is.
@_date: 2019-12-04 07:44:16
It won’t.
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:33:05
They are at least not completely scammy.
@_date: 2019-04-06 08:10:23
 I bet you love Joe Rogan. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:55:39
Classic bubble.
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:19:25
I heard he died like the childish dreams of people hoping to get rich quick. Maybe that’s only an urban legend though.
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:54:46
You’re not wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:22:17
Tears. End. In. This. Will.
Rearrange the words to make an appropriate statement.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:07:26
Does this mean I can afford a graphics card again? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:59:23
You need to add more exclamation marks!!!!!!!! That’s why the price isn’t stopping!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:05:31
Oops. Edited. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:56:04
They must be in trouble 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:03:07
It’s an opportunity for some. Johnny-come-late that was banging on about lambo s and the moon is hurting.

The drug space needs heroes? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:40:25
Great to see mainstream adoption. The uses of blockchain are endless! 
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:54:34
This isn't far of what Goldman Sachs said would happen...
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:32:14
You’re right. But my god it’s so much fun to watch!
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:19:58
Everybody knows the truth now. It's funny how everybody's opinion changes at the same so that everyone is always right

I was talking about the top commentor. The one that called him a loser 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:11:19
This is a lovely image. However, all the memes are really making me wish you fools lose money. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:27:46
Idiot the moral is use bitcoin. Fiat would be worthless if people don't use it. Buy stuff with bitcoin sell stuff for bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:42:41
He does. The modern success story is the guy on the internet making snarky remarks. The loser is the guy who does something.
It's like how the guy in the pub Making snarky comments about football managers knows more than they do. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:01:23
If you've never been happier then I feel very sorry for you.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:53:51
You don’t have bills? You lucky little fucker
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:25:36
Oh makes sense. Yay bitcoin!

We are all dying. Some just fasters than others.

Bcash suffers from two problems. First, the name, even if it was legit the stealing of the name will always make it seem like a scam. Secondly, the people that champion it are known criminals and Chinese miners...
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:10:04
Is there any way to block certain kinds of posts? Like keyword blocking? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:28:50
I think the risk is we become a sub like Bcash where we spend all the time bashing others because there's not a lot going on with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:11:03
No. It’ll sink again. Then rise. Then sink. Rinse and repeat
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:18:18
We know by now. They will always keep it up
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:14:02
Even idiots are getting on board now. Unstoppable bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:35:13
That is a Lamborghini. They have embraced retro-clique 
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:09:34
I stand with Jesus! And bitcoin! But not the anti-christ who calls himself Bitcoinjesus!

I honestly thought the pic at the top was a piss take. Turns out people do support him...
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:55:57
The Taliban are less violent than Isis. Therefore, studies show that the Taliban reduce violence.

Freeross.org is going to have unbiased facts??? Really?

Joe Rogan may have something to do with its popularity.

That’s nice dear. But how does this relate? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:10:46
I have a business proposition for you. I want to follow you around collect clippings periodically. I’ll use a high-tech toenail removal tool and the muscle-memory algorithms in my fingers to remove any new growths. We’ll call this process... “Mining” 
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:48:50
Below 3000 would be better. The lower the more I can get! Lol
