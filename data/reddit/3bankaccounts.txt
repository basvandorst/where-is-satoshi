Lol relax it's just a meme, not an engineering project
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:32:49
How sway?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:03:05
Great. I'm in ✋
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:54:06
Dude, what are you talking about I have an account with like 8 exchanges and Gemini is one of them. Even if you transfered your ETH to Gemini, there was no way you could have possibly traded your ETH directly to BTC. Gemini doesn't offer that. The only way to do it is ETH&gt;USD&gt;BTC. Good luck and have a nice day ��

You should have never bought back in the second time. This isn't greed, it's lack of understanding, impatience and impulse. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:25:39
I use 3 bank accounts, hence the name
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:59:22
Totally bad advice.
SELL ALL YOUR BITCOINS
You can buy back later, in December ��
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:06:14
Awesome story. This is exactly why I want to be super rich! 
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:56:57
Yes. In order to go from ETH to USD first, you'd have to SELL your ETH to get USD. Then use your USD to BUY BTC. It's very simple really.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:17:49
Where are they holding the sale? Maybe I can get some for a discount?
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:43:43
Strong hands. I see!
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:08:34
Good I'll just ahead and put a limit order for 50 BTCs at $100 each ��
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:57:31
They should try to kill Litecoin instead lol
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:07:12
Yay! We made it ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:00:16
Not a coder, but here's a suggestion...
Is there a way to write your code, where all the legit/verified accounts that are being impersonated will be the baseline for your code, but your bot will run through those verified accounts and their tweets to post an alert under any Twitter reply that mentions certain keywords for a giveaway scams?
Basically, the idea is, instead of trying to add a new list of scam accounts to your bot (which could be endless), maybe you could just identify all the legit accounts ONCE, and identify all known keywords or language patterns that these scammer tend to use in their posts. So instead of trying to add a new scam account to the list every time, your bot would verify which accounts that are not legit or don't match the list of legit/verified accounts and just post an alert every time any amount that's not legit mentions certain keywords about a giveaway.
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:23:20
Either you're a legit whale who is trying to engage in something possibly illegal or you're a scammer looking for bait... ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:08:11
GDAX is the best. You can move thousands of dollars with $0 fees and even transfer BTC (limit order) to another exchange for $0 fees as well.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:21:46
Nope. Not I ✋��
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:52:39
Very very confusing headline dude ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:03:47
There's Gemini and bitstamp... Both of which I have an account but never used, lol.
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:05:20
Relax. Have you tried ACH or wire transfer with them yet?
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:20:44
You might hear from Coinbase support in the after life. 
I just double check anything I'm doing with their FAQs section and hope I never have to need their customer support.
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:50:17
How many are actually invested or own Bitcoin? That's the real question...
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:24:32
What kind of English is this ? ������
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:15:07
He said something very important that a lot of people don't talk about here, and that is how REGULATION will be good for adoption.
The reason why a lot of the mainstream public have not adopted or invested in crypto yet is because they are SCARED they will lose their money or scared that "it's some kind of scam". So basically regulation would make them feel safer about getting involved, and there may be a HUGE SURGE in price.
Stay ready guys!

Honestly, I started to FOMO a bit when I started reading this thread. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
I'm still solid though. I haven't sold or bought anything on FOMO, but I do get the urge in the back of my mind when I get on here.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:00:31
He would have to sell first, that's what he's thinking. Where can I buy BTC with eth?
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:33:47
Bullshit. This is to get small time investors high so they can all get taken to the cleaners later
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:22:39
I keep telling newbies market cap does not matter. The only thing that truly matters to me is 24hr volume, of volume over a 7-30 day period
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:16:24
Nope. Can't buy BTC with Eth on gdax. Can only buy ETH with BTC there. Same with Gemini. Please stop spreading fake news
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:46:39
Damn. He just bodied the whole government ��
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:11:25
I recommend doing deposits through GDAX instead of directly on Coinbase.
Also it can take up to 14 days. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:31:33
Time is of the essence. Can't read every article
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:19:00
Like 30mins or 1 hr MAX
But usually less than 30
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:25:43
You have no clue what you're talking about
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:35:53
Wow. So he's a piker? 
Who's he by the way? ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:20:28
I hope it does. I got a nice deposit waiting to buy back in
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:03:08
I think his opinion might have caused some FUD, and now it's being reflected in the market... Everything's red!!! ��
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:47:11
Lol. Wtf? ������
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:24:12
Send it to me, and I'll wire it to you for a small fee ��
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:56:12
Again, I know what a DEBIT CARD; but that's beyond this conversation. 
You said your card is blocked, but you really want to buy some crypto; so I'm suggesting a SOLUTION that can help you achieve your objective of buying crypto without further stress.
I too have a DEBIT CARD, and in fact, I've never owned a credit card in my life. A debit card can be treated as a debit or credit card, hence why you can run into problems like that. 
I move thousands of dollars every week to Coinbase/GDAX doing just what I suggested. I'm just telling you how to solve your problem. That's all. Take it or leave it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:20:49
I'm hoping for $2,500 ��
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:32:03
What is this, reverse FUD?
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:42:08
Totally agree. There are "insider whale groups" that collude to pump  Bitcoin, along with exchanges manipulating price.  It's almost a proven fact at this point.
Just look at the rally we just had yesterday... In fact, there was no major news all week, just a random pump... And interestingly enough one of these insiders predicted this pump right to the Tee on tradingview. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:59:17
This is a clear pump. I don't know if this is a good thing for crypto. We got whales and exchanges manipulating prices
