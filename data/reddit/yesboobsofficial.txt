Add (NSFW) to it, it's a business that takes Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:40:35
I run a website that is based on subscriptions. We have had two people join using Bitcoin. I got payment from both of them. Only one of them is actually enjoying the perks of membership. The other is MIA. I have no idea who they are. It would be nice if more people used it because our processor is charging us a whopping 14.5% fee on every transaction. I use Coinbase btw for our payments. I tell the customer to e-mail me so I can manually make their account as this is different from our regular sign up system.

Example of chargebacks vs Bitcoin savings... I run a paysite and our monthly membership is $15 with Bitcoin always... and $20-25 with CC.
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:29:44
It's Reddit
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:29:05
Giving Coinbase all those fees.... OOLLOLOL
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:37:46
Yup. Running an adult site, Chargebacks were a big worry starting up but they actually haven't been a problem surprisingly. But we are dealing with a niche group and providing exactly what they want and CCBill is pretty good w/ weeding out shady people who do chargebacks after being a satisfied customer.

At what cost?

This comes to mind. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:13:15
One company we were going to go w/ for a payment gateway... Chargeback = we lost the sale, they got their money back AND we had to pay $45 on top of it all. We run a big boob site yesboobs.com

It's "High Risk" for chargebacks. If we did more volume the rate would be lower but we are just getting started.

"Porn site" owner here. I pay $1,000 per year to be able to run credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) as well as 14.5% for **each transaction**. We accept Bitcoin and offer DEEP discounts if people sign up using it. Which a very small amount of people actually do. Like 2 users for every 100 are Bitcoin subs.
@_date: 2015-07-02 06:38:34
Less than 1%
Edit: I Think only one of our memberships was a fraud. It was a chargeback because someone's credit card was stolen. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:22:20
We offer to pay our models with Bitcoin. No one has taken us up on the offer yet. And less than 5% of our member base of YesBoobs.com is Bitcoin signups. Adoption of Bitcoin is still very small compared to credit card users in the US.
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:21:26
Ok. Thank you for answering. My takeaway is this: Consider that innocent life is worth protecting and that police are not always going to be there for you when you need them. You may live in a super-safe area but not everyone does. Here in America, we have the right to protect innocent life through self-defense.
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:21:24
What, England?  Any other examples? They tried a similar thing here in America and were greeted appropriately:

People don't actually use Bitcoin so it's a way of me thanking those that do.
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:06:26
Yes. We'll work our way to that in due time. We don't need male talent it will likely be the models' significant others in order to keep the site's spirit of being anti-mainstream, realism, and natural.
@_date: 2015-09-30 17:03:03
It's called subjective value theory and it's been around for awhile. Bitcoin is making more aware, this post makes it sound like it's brainwashing you lol

Ours is 20% CHEAPER
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:21:01
I take Bitcoin on my site and charge a lot less for a Bitcoin sign up vs credit card. There's less work that goes into it for me I think.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:30:53
Having run an adult site for a year now and taking Bitcoin the entire time, this is most likely the real reason.
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:25:38
There's plenty of free food in dumpsters but you'll pay more to have a chef cook it up to your liking. That's what our site is. We're big boob chefs. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:28:08
Affiliate programs are typically 50 percent of sign up and they expect rebills to be too. They're not giving them more than the sub costs but I'm sure there's crazy exceptions out there. Generally if they're doing bundles or something else.
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:25:29
Do you need a NSFW tag to know not to click it while you're at work?
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:29:38
There's recurring billing with Bitcoin and honestly people keep a sub even if they infrequently use it like a gym membership. There's very little forgetting on the part of a member.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:16:39
Don't act like you speak for everyone on the internet. People pay for a quality product. Why pay to go to a restaurant to eat when trash is free?
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:35:53
We hope that it leads to that...

It's good to offer a retention bonus. But having price go down every month isn't a good business practice. It's saying your service isn't worth much to begin with.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:24:20
I offer it. :-)
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:06:44

Who the hell pays for food from a restaurant anyway? The dumpster is free, guy!
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:14:34
You can totally do recurring billing through Coinbase and I have that as a payment option for members.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:23:55
You don't. I actually know lol. Unless they're betting that Bitcoin with decline in value vs the USD over time.
@_date: 2015-09-26 09:00:19
I'm aware. I keep my Bitcoin as Bitcoin. Later on, if I convert to cash, it might be 2013 prices. It's a possibility.

Small biz and I'm an early adopter of Bitcoin. Our site has been using it since its launch. We give a discounted price for using Bitcoin rather than charging more. Love big boobs? Check us out.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:59:32
Then don't. No one is forcing you. There's lots of reason to pay for it though. Niche content, first day access, quality control, a model you like, faster streaming, downloading, lack of viruses.
@_date: 2015-09-26 09:01:31
Sounds dicey. We just have a 50/50 split with known established bloggers/promoters.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:19:20
Brb going to have a one year subscription for Bitcoin (at a huge discount because I live Bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:16:35
They might have put backdoors on it. Definitely do this.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:25:23
Some sites let you purchase individual clips. We decided not to do this because all our content bundled together for $15/month with Bitcoin is already an amazing deal. I don't know what we would price every video and pic set at, at least $1 or $2 and it would cost some upfront $$$$ to program it into our existing code.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:15:53
I bet they plugged it in to see what it was and what data was on it.

Lots of people. You get what you pay for.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:14:04
 is $15/month (in Bitcoin, of course) for all our content. If you like busty women, check us out. We're run by a busty model. Thanks in advance! Love Bitcoin &amp; have been using it for some time now. Edit, we even offer to pay our models in Bitcoin when they shoot w/ us but no one has taken us up in the offer. Someone actually turned us down because they didn't carefully read our offer and thought we only paid in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:06:43
Actually I agree with you a lot. I am against the plastic surgery and excessive production that goes into mainstream porn. We are a small biz started by a model. Typing on my phone. My point I meant to say was that a person will pay for a product that they enjoy. We arent industry insiders or anything like that. We are just two people who run yesboobs.com
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:08:39
Believe it or not, it takes time and/or money to produce.

Help out a small biz instead. Yesboobs accepts Bitcoin at $15/month  *Seriously $core doesn't need your Bitcoin. They also take Paypal... does that make any sense?*
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:58:37
idk why this is being downvoted, it's really brilliant. Anyone who knows anything about marketing knows that "sex sells". Anyone who knows anything about comedy will know what George Carlin had to say about this subject.

What site do you run? PM me if you want. We're a smaller site that just got started (doing it all DIY with no help from big studios). We take Bitcoin and have only gotten a few subs from it. I love Bitcoin and I'm happy we got them and would like to see more. We offer a huge discount and there's the built in bonus of being able to buy a sub anonymously. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:11:07
Just gonna plug our site  =)
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:33:44
That's the difference between hobbyists and professionals. I look at it like this, my neighbor may make a burger for free and invite me over but I'll still go to my favorite restaurant and get a steak. You get what you pay for and a lot of times with "free" anything you're the product. We run our site with no ads or tracking. And it's unique, quality made content.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:24:59
It says under the QR code: Special offer! Join with Bitcoin for only $15 USD per month.
We have our own way of verifying payment so that isn't an issue.
@_date: 2016-07-17 22:56:54
I mean, it doesn't hurt. I run YesBoobs.com and SarahRae.com both sites take Bitcoin and have since 2014, we don't get many BtC sales despite a huge discount but it still helps &amp; offers a level of anonymity that customers value.
