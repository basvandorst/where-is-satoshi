Meaning you only see bitcoin rising in value. But if that's the case how can anyone justify spending bitcoins ?
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:32:49
You match buyer with closest seller , and make a direct transfer. Transfers within the same bank are free and in case you have different banks you use a third party decentralized account that will wire transfer the money at a later time.
The downside is fees and time .

What's wrong with taxes ? if no one pay taxes new roads never get build.
I never got people bragging about tax evasion.

I doesn't matter who is user 0 , his identity will be open . And like i said it's not a finished idea and i was hoping for some help but as i see there is none to be found. I know there are issues with this approach i was hopping for possible sollutions to these problems, maybe someone somewhere was working on something similar and may want to share some insight.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:58:18
I can make something similar with leds if anyone is interested ...

Can you make a youtube video of your setup ? It will be an interesting watch.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:32:33
Will it ever be stabilized ? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:00:14
Ok what about maintanance ? And privatised facilities create monopolies see ISP's.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:06:15
Trust me i hate governments as much as you do , but going full private is not the answer you see what happend when healthcare went private. If you want to live in a dog eat dog world you may realize that is not the world you wanted to live in. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:20:16
That's not an absolute , the government issued franchise is real of course but there are other monopolies also.

So in other words as long as you hold you should not be affected ? Witch means people will hold their btc in a "safe".

Exactly , who is stopping anyone to make asics with ram ? 
From bitcontalk :


So depending on the processors eficiency most likely for a 5 GH machine you will need around 64 Gb of ram and a big ass bandwith. As of now this is far fetched and no one will make such a monstrosity but given enough incentive someone will.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:15:52
Like what ? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:23:02
I still don't get how you plan on founding facilities (water/electricity etc)? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:42:22
Since it's a limited amount of btc more volume == more demand and more demand == rising prices and rising prices == less spending and so on. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:21:54


It fluctuates for a short time but in the long run it will only go up as long as there's more people jumping on it, so unless we're all on the same boat it will never reach stability. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:45:57
That will be great hope it gets there soon so people can start really using it . 
Just to note i own no bitcoins and i will probably not own any untill the price will stabilize. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:44:42
Tolls ? Do you imagine how many are there going to be ? Traffic jams for everyone.
@_date: 2013-04-26 12:55:18
Why is there spam on this subreddit ? 
@_date: 2013-04-27 07:36:02
You are right about selling id's , it's going to be an issue . But i can't think of a better way to ad users but also keep some kind of trak of their identity. Anonymous people will always try to scam other people since they face no consequences, and i know it's contradictory with the bitcoin philosophy but i can't see a better way . 
If you would do it how would you approach this issue ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:48:55
People who don't understand programming are always going to talk shit about it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:51:26
So what's your advice on using bitcoins right now ?  
@_date: 2013-04-20 09:55:10
I could probably do that but why do you want to create such a service ?
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:13:20
How will you verify new accounts? 
- An account can only created by an existing user , just like in real life we all have a small circle of people we trust . That way we can trace back a person trough the chain . 
How would you know it's the real name of a scammer?
- The user that made that account has to divulge his identity or he will be removed from the blockchain and can no longer make transactions. 
Also we will travel further down the chain and ask the linked users to divulge the scammers peers. 
What would you do if you recieved a real name?
- I em not sure i understand this question , but if you are asking if you recieve a scammers real name ? you added to the blacklist so other people will not add him to the network again . In other words if you scam someone you will never be let back in the network .
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:07:43
Good to know , i don;t want to reinvent the weel . Since you are here can i ask you what can a webdevloper do to help the bitcoin community ? 
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:11:23
I understand and like i said it's not a finished idea , but we clearly need something we can rely on . The third party that you talk about is going to be faced with the same problems as a decentralised network will be , somenone somewhere will need to judge who is right and who is wrong.

You know that will never happen in one day maybe half of year but deffinetly not one day. Of course the value of one BTC may drop but that's still not good since sellers will take the loss.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:13:16
Retire ? From what ? I like my job i would do my job even if i were rich , i might not work for my current boss but i would still work. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:25:51
Yes but the bounce is between 88 and 98 not between 50 and 900.

Don't rely on avast or any antivirus to keep you safe. Encrypt your wallet and if possible use linux with ( encrypted home folder where you keep your wallet ).
