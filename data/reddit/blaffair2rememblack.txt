infinitely divisible, sucker. Deflationary means it encourages me to spend, if I think I'll be richer in the future. E.g., if I need a car TODAY, I'm not waiting 5 years down the road to buy the car - I buy the car when I NEED IT, and rejoice that my future car will be cheaper.  It also encourages me to buy at the price that preserves most wealth.  It introduces resource efficiency (frugality) into an ever wasteful economy

1275? Seriously?  This used to be a bannable offense.  I guess we're hurting for content with all the real discussion and noob-questions being snuffed out
"Just joined bitcoin last week.  Why can't we have bigger blocks?"  (DELETE), (DELETE), (MOTHERFUCKING DELEEEEETE). 
Idiot mods.

So media interest in China is increasing along with investment  but China is a big nothing-master, so who cares?
Meanwhile, US media articles remain flat since 2013 - which is a rate only 10x that of 2011. 
Is murder still illegal? I could murder the faggot who wrote that article

Bitcoin has about another 500-700 years before this type of implementation is viable

Fuck Coinbase. Who need's it?  Red MoneyGram phone was better. Lurr.

Right, but if on-chain fees go up to $100 dollars because only 7tps are allowed and bitcoin is not the reserve currency, then the average human will need a damn middleman anyway, unless blocks are increased. The optimal size isnt known now, but what is known is the higher the fees the higher the number of middlemen.  Trust me, bitcoin banks will be very real
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:39:12
Oh, baby - to me, as far as bitcoin's success goes, price is everything.  That's how I get my promised "freedom".  I hope for bitcoin's $ price to go up, up, and up until it disappears when the $ becomes shit paper.

hate it or love it, circle is differentiating itself from the rest.  Otherwise, it's just competing with the rest of the exchanges out there, providing the same service as them at a loss.  Come on, stupids. If you dont have business dev experience yourself, back off.

Edit: wow, that wasn't hard to figure out.

Do not gloss over the "going around and destroying other people's tobacco" part.  This could happen with bitcoin. If it's known you hold a lot of bitcoin, and it's perceived that youre not willing to turn it over to your muggers/hillary clintons, shooting you is the next best thing, as you may be the only one with access to x amount of bitcoin.

Clinton was a disgusting hag herself - Thank Russia (it wasn't them) for exposing that fake, cheating bitch. Fuck you, SHE CHEATED AND GOT EXPOSED RIGHTEOUSLY.  Dislike him all you want, but that motherfucker Donald won fair and square by tearing down the fourth wall. He is the beginning of the great rebuilding, even if a lot of liberal fucks and welfare rats have to pay the price

Nothing either of you said invalidates the other.  Sometimes we think we're arguing but we just fly by each other. It's like how when two galaxies collide and not a single star touches another.

you're kidding right?  I'm not talking about some schmo on reddit. I'm talking about bias on their own sight.   I don't trust any company to tell me how great they are doing.

wtf. New people only come around here by and large when the price is at an all-time high. So fuck yea, Im going to tell those assholes to buy asap.  If I tell them to buy 1, 2 or 3 months from now, they wont ever get around to it until the next bubble down. STFU

No, the group with access to lower operating costs will beat out the group with "da most money" before long.  If solar power ever becomes the cheapest source of of energy, then wherever it's daytime with clear skies will at that time  be most profitable. Cheap solar is our best hope for decentralization - miners hooked up to the sun will be operating at the lowest cost for that period.

We can't objectively say whether or not he's a leech until we prove he's benefiting or has benefited from public goods or services. (Roads, anyone?) 
Don't be quick to defend this guy, because there is a high probability he is either directly or indirectly benefitting for shit we fucking pay for. Tax dollars may be embezzeled and wasted, but not all of it is
You all are as big of pests as the system you rail against. And if humanity had it your way, we'd have just as much oppression as we do now, only more fairly distributed, so stfu

considering the extremists are the committers on both sides, what use is it to play the middle?

Um, y'all are going to be sorely disappointed in the short term.  I can see some early adopter crashing the price for the next couple of weeks/months just for laughs.
