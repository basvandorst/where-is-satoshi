We address this a bit in the book because of the very problems you mention. A lot of big addresses are exchanges, which represent lots of users and many whales hold their coins in small chunks.
The wealth distribution isn't something that the blockchain is going to tell us, especially with the advent of layer 2 tech and I'm not sure it's important for anything other than people complaining about it.

Yes! We wrote it because we were a bit tired of having to explain the impact of Bitcoin or why it matters to our friends and family. That said, I think there's a general Silicon-Valley-centric view of Bitcoin which we tried to address in the book. Specifically, Bitcoin is a world-wide phenomenon and it's worthy of discussion everywhere, not just as a tech for programmers.


The human rights impact is what we focus a lot on. Bitcoin really is freedom from those that can take away our wealth. To me, that's the easiest way to get pre-coiners interested and looking at Bitcoin.

Thank you!

The whole book is 115 pages, with about 25 pages of Q&amp;A and 5 pages of additional resources. You can easily read the main part (75 pages) in one sitting.

Depends on when you got in. Usually, moon is about 2 or 3 bubbles after getting in. Lambos are roughly affordable around the same time.
Lambos are nice, but low time preference capital accumulation to build something awesome is what I think most people are saving for.

I personally don't see Bitcoin as competing with Visa/Amex/Paypal/Venmo/ApplePay/Google Wallet/Octopus Card/WeChat/AliPay. Those are all \*way\* more convenient than Bitcoin because more vendors accept them.
The killer feature is store of value. There, it's only really competing against USD, Stocks, Real Estate and Gold. BTC has done better than all 4 and is more liquid than Real Estate, requires less research than picking stocks and is much easier to move around than all of them. Buying coffee isn't what's in demand, finding a place where you can actually save is. If you think about it, there really aren't any places where you can do that today, at least not easily, quickly or without significant amounts of time spent researching.

It does have some wonderful illustrations by and Timi Ajiboye, but no characters with a cowboy hat.
If you want a character with a cowboy hat, there's [this book]( by the Bitcoin Rabbi.

I would add that [Yan's book]( is in our Additional Resources section.
Our aim was to make the book very approachable and not intimidating. It's shorter than a lot of other books and meant to give someone who reads it enough information to understand why it matters.

If you really want to know, I outlined the whole process we used [here]( It turns out that the hard part is getting everyone together to do the sprint. The rest of it is a lot like a code sprint or a design sprint. Lots of work done in a short amount of time. I personally really enjoyed working with and and my other coauthors.

Yes! It's already in production. We'll have it up on Amazon in the next month or so.

Yes! We're translating to Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese and others. If you are interested in a particular language, please let us know and we can make them happen!
We're collecting donations for translations [here](

Great question! The analogy with TCP/IP is accurate in the sense that there are network effects to Bitcoin. It's not an accurate analogy in the sense that Bitcoin is money and TCP/IP is not.
The important thing to note is that Bitcoin is decentralized digital money, which before 2008, didn't exist. The tech is relevant to the extent that the tech makes the decentralization possible in the digital realm. The technical improvements are essentially trying to preserve the decentralization and scarcity.
Does that make sense?

Thanks! You're exactly the audience we were thinking of. We would love to get your review on Amazon or GoodReads =)
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:20:32
It's a quick read, so hopefully, you can read and ask questions as you go =)

Hard to say whether living like that short term will fit your risk profile. That said, long term, that's a pretty good strategy, even against the best fiat currencies.
Essentially, that strategy will work better the more the central bank prints. In Argentina, that sort of strategy will pay off faster than in the US.

Short answer: we're going to use both sources of funding.
Long answer: We initially thought we'd only be using profits from the book, but we were surprised by how people wanted to donate towards a particular translation. This makes sense since certain translations won't get prioritized without earmarked funds. After all, we only have so much time and money. Plan is to allow the donation addresses and feedback from the community to dictate which translations to do next. In a sense, we're using donations as a way to gauge interest in a particular language.

We don't have Turkish on the radar, but happy to consider! I'll DM you some contact info.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:34:49
Good question. We'd love to publish it in other places, but given that we wrote the book less than a month ago, our only real option was Amazon. Definitely will look into it.

I'll let say more, but the idea was to make the book very newbie-friendly. The title makes it seem unintimidating and easy to read, which is what we had in mind.
