This is actually quite inspiring.

Expenditure of electricity from mining is clean, theoretically we can scale infinitely and not affect the environment.

That's assuming there will never be any discrepancies in Lightning. By the way, I spend half my time studying and working on Lightning, I just think there is a lot of stuff that needs to be figured out and implemented before we can come to conclusions such as, "most people will keep funds on LN for lifetime".

Mmmmm, those weren't banking systems, at best they were pseudo-banking systems, but really what you just described sounds more like peer to peer lending, which is not what modern banking is.

I agree with you, although I think people forget that the other important factor is the infrastructure. The Lightning Network needs time to develop, so I treat the "cryptocurrency depression" as a means to breathe and build.

That is the best bitcoin meme of all time. It also supports the idea that the fiat system is very much like the matrix, and bitcoin is the red pill.

Last time I checked a finney is ten millionth of a bitcoin. A finney is also a thousandth of ether.

The expenditure of electricity is clean. I'm sorry if I wasn't being precise.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:20:18
Electricity is clean energy, I think that is enough for the environment.
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:29:51
Yeah, why is it that bitcoin is the only system that gets criticized for its energy consumption? One of the most important backbones of society, money, and you're worried about energy consumption, I say it doesn't consume enough.

I think the way Lightning will bootstrap itself is by relying on the price pumps occurring in bitcoin and litecoin, both of which have Lightning, and who knows what other incentives could and should be conceived by some good game theorists out there.
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:30:55
It's very convenient to ignore other sources of energy.

There is a renaissance in money, that's for sure.

I can't wait to use finneys to buy stuff, rest in peace friend.
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:59:59
My friend, do you really not see the value of smart contract platforms, which actually compliment bitcoin with dapps that run SPV. The older I get, the more I see the value in being open minded. Don't shut everything out bud, it'll work against you.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:04:29
You made my day.

First of all, the Lightning Network would blow visa out of the water. Second, people for thousands of years used gold and silver to transact, and both of those metals were deflationary. Cheap money is the reason why communists get sympathy from me.

It is, and maybe you're right and bitcoin consumes too much energy, but what's the alternative for a more robust and decentralized monetary system.
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:29:41
I want to apologize, I actually feel bad about saying it doesn't consume enough. It's just so frustrating to see bitcoin mining be attacked, while the banking system which also spends massive amounts of energy while only serving maybe around 10% of the world. Bitcoin can serve everyone and probably will spend less energy. I'm not well educated on the topic of energy, but I know there are clean derivation techniques, such as: solar, wind, hydro, etc. Again I apologize for not being sympathetic.
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:31:38
That's interesting, tell me is bitcoin monotheistic or polytheistic.
