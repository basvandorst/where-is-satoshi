I can't help but imagine sometimes that some people sitting in a dark room on an oval shaped table and brainstorming ways to get rid of Bitcoin

It's time to move to a new exchange then
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:51:31
I'll be buying after the fork and I don't want to buy S2X, just plain old BTC. I am not 100% sure what are they planning to do with the fork so that's why I asked.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:33:57
Hahahahaha love it
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:14:57
Actually I would because to be a believer in crypto you have to challenge your basic instinct of playing it safe and hoping for the best. It's a strange feeling of having this kind of control on your own money, most people are too dumb to even recognize it.

banks, duh...
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:55:31
I always think about setting up my own full node but then I forget about it. I am stuck in a loop :/
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:10:11
I will most likely be buying after fork, any recommendation for a good exchange?

First don't do something just to get on the hype train, always educate yourself before doing anything.
Invest which you are willing to lose, today's 5k could be 0k tomorrow (highly doubt that but always prepare yourself for the worst, this way you won't get a surprise. I hate surprises)
Now to the real thing, if i were you, I would distribute a bit among different coins which you believe in, not too many just a couple this way you will have some diversity in your portfolio.
Good luck.��
