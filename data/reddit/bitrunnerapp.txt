Like for several other mobile related industries, for example mobile gambling, location spoofing is at the forefront of our thoughts. Through a combination of network carrier mobile location and fraud detection algorithms, we are confident that we can weed out bots and other hack attempts. Since network carrier mobile location costs money, the plan to use the mobile devices internal location APIs for most of the game, but anytime anything critical would happen, like digging up a coin, or planting a mine, we would run a check with the network carrier (or company that provides such, e.g. Locaid). We may also incorporate iBeacons into the mix for indoor locations and/or particularly high stake locations. 
And last but not least we should note that this is a game and not a Bitcoin Wallet. And here you also have the option to deposit your in game Bitcoins in to *Bitrunner Banks* so use them as often you can.

Hi cravenj1,
**1. What amounts of Bitcoins are at stake/What would be at stake today?**
We are planning of using some portion of the Indiegogo money to seed the game in the beginning but most of the in app purchases will go back directly into the game, plus most of the proceeds from the location based advertisements, so the final amount really depends on how many people play the game, buy stuff and how many location based advertisements there are. As game designers our goal is to create a world rich and exciting.
**2. How long would it take to mine/How much do the upgrades help?**
These are both very relevant questions but we would like to pass them before we don't test them out in simulations and closed beta, in general our goal is to create balanced in game world.
**3. Are these teamups verbal or are there going to be groups in-game?**
Verbal teamups are always there as an option but we are also planning to design groups in-game where the distribution of Bitcoins after a group harvest or loot is divided equally by our system.

Hey sinn98! Thanks for the cake! :) 
iPhone is still an option and the reason is that we can make it very clear to Apple that all our in app purchases will go through exclusively the App Store payment system (this one a major friction point for Apple) and we can also take out the Bitcoin “cashing out” part of the game to a separate website from our iOS app. With this two steps we are likely to get accepted in the app store but there are no 100% warranties.

In short Bitcoins in the game are placed and managed by our app. The funds for them come from the in app purchases (we reinvest to the ecosystem the majority of every purchase) and location based ad partners, which include small businesses, franchises, government tourism agencies, etc. And like lemkenski pointed out earlier, retailers would get foot traffic.

Great point! We thought of this issue and the solution will be properly designed and tested game mechanics (during a closed beta). Try not to think of one single solution but rather a system of solutions acting together. Let us give you some examples: 
1. Explosives are going to be expensive tools with different strength. Strength will define the amount of Bitcoin you can take off from another player.
2. Banks are there to protect your Bitcoin so deposit as often you can. 
3. After an explosion the "victim" can't see or pick up his/her lost Bitcoins for the next 24 hours and by this leaving space for others to pick them up.
4. Some explosives can have two detonations, the first one may not take all of the victim’s coin, but the second will arm 1-5 minutes later and explode in the next 24 hours if the victim tries to come back. This will motivate him to leave the area as soon as possible and not come back for a while.
5. Would it really be any different than people clobbering each other over the last Tickle-Me Elmo on the shelf at XMas?
These where just some quick examples how we would approach this issue.

We definitely going to do that! Placing Bitcoins at interesting locations around the world so players with taste of adventure can have fun collecting them!
