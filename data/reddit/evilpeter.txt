Irrelevant. The original post was meant to show how widespread bitcoin is becoming.  I was just pointing out that 5000 isn't widespread at all.
If anything, the fact that there are only a couple dozen (even that is generous) "big revenue" companies accepting bitcoin goes to show that it's even less widespread since the vast majority of the cited 5000 acceptors do nowhere near the revenue of even a small pub.
EDIT: to be clear I'm not poopooing bitcoin, I'm just saying that it's way to early to celebrate adoption. 
If the pub example rubbed people the wrong way, maybe this is a better perspective- MasterCard is accepted by 36 MILLION vendors.

My point is that it cannot practically happen. Credit relies on growing the investor's investment, otherwise why would they ever invest? But in a deflationary currency there is no real way of setting competitive (with fiat) interest rates from a borrower's perspective, since the investor would require at the very least, his principal plus some profit on the loan. This means that right off the bat, lending in bitcoin starts off at a handicap of the difference between the inflation of fiat and the deflation of bitcoin.  Let's say, simply for the sake of argument, that bitcoin deflates at just 10% a year, and fiat inflated at 1%.  A mere 5% interest rate on a bitcoin loan would in this case be the equivalent of a 16% (5+11) interest rate in fiat. As I said, it is simply not viable.

Still, one should never forget history. Everybody knew (correctly) that Railroads, Automobiles, airlines, alternative energy, and the internet, were going to be the "next big thing", and they were right. But far more companies in those industries went belly up than succeeded. There were over 200 American car companies in the 20s and 30s for example.

That's not very practical either, because for exchange, both parties will then have to be in the same denomination - which can lead to crazy confusion, and the possibility of over-paying by various factors of 10. 
Nobody is trying to 'impose' any rules on anything. There is a very real problem here that needs addressing (how you don't see that it's a problem baffles me) and people are having an open discussion to try to solve it. Hopefully, a consensus can/will be reached as to how to eliminate the problem system-wide by altering the open-source protocol (but that looks less and less likely, since it is obviously difficult to reach consensus). 
One possible solution would be to have a pre-programmed change to the 'standard' denomination - a kind of division (much like a stock split) once certain conditions are met, if you like. But deciding how or when to implement that (every time the prevailing denomination reached 1000 USD? - or independent of another currency, just on a predetermined calendar recurrence?) has it's own set of problems that make it too difficult to implement too.

This is flat out wrong. Deflationary currencies AMPLIFY wealth disparity. Since the value compared to other currencies increases over time, the earlier you have some, the more (by significant powers) you have later. That "eariler" point can be any single point of time, and at any single point in time the wealthier you are, by definition, the more you have. That's why all the initial "early adopters" are rolling in money - they are multiples more wealthy than their friends who didnt conver to bitcoin. For somebody who only started buying BTC a couple of months ago- they will never be as wealthy in gains as the early early adopters but they have already realized a four-fold increase in the value of their btc relative to those who didnt buy btc then.
As far the "well those who have the greatest amount of btc will eventually sell them to buy things and their coins will end up in other people's hands" - this is just a jaw-dropping idea that screams of a total lack of understanding of economics. Yes- those with more will spend- the twins for example- and those with less may end up receiving the coins that are spent- but there are two fundamental problems with your point- 
1) those coins are being exchanged for something of equal value at the instant of purchase. They are not being given away. The amount of "wealth" doesnt change when btc is spent just as if dollars are spent- you dont become 10million$ less wealthy when you buy a 10million$ yacht.  
2) how can you assume that couns being spent by the rich will/are being spent on the poor anyway? I'd love to take 10million for a yacht- the slight problem is that I don't have a yacht to sell for that much.
In the best case, once btc is normalized as a currency, we'll reach a point where the same "rich get richer / poor get poorer" rules apply as they always have in economics. Until that point, it's a "those who have btc get richer those who dont get (relatively) poorer" situation. But either way, there is nothing inherently equalizing about digital deflationary currencies.

but bitcon is INDEPENDENT of the banking system - so banning banks is irrelevant. And if anything, strengthens bitcoin's independence.  basically it's now forbidden for banks to have/offer btc denominated accounts and/or to act as btc exchanges. they dont do either of these currently, and there would have been no advantage to consumers if they had started, with the exception that they would have been potentially better suited/able to run exchanges than any number of the sketchy internet exchanges there are. but it's no loss

You realize that a deflationary currency, like BTC is HORRIBLE for the poor and indebted right? Let's say I lent you 1,000 BTC last year. Let's say I even put some interest on there - a mere 10 percent, even. So you owe me the principle, as well as an additional 100BTC per year. Now, the longer you're in my debt, the deeper and deeper you fall into shit and and 'richer' I get relative to the buying power of 1 BTC. In fact, let's scrap any interest - cuz I'm a good guy. There's no way you'll be able to climb out of your obligation.  When I lent it to you, you may have used the 1000 BTC to buy a car - but pretty soon, 1000 BTC is 10 yearly salaries, or whatever.
There are many benefits to BTC, but it also includes the characteristic of increasing - and even AMPLIFYING - wealth distribution disparity. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:02:29
The volatility is not due to people not spending. It's due to a relatively large trading volume as compared to total number of coins as well as an imbalanced buy/sell ratio. Way more people want to buy than sell lately (thankfully), as one can easily see on a number of charts. Most of those people set their buy price, but many just throw in a 'buy' order, and if the next available sell order happens to be higher than the previous one, the 'price' Jumps and fluctuated wildly. Then - the same thing happens in reverse when people start consolidating gains by selling.

People need to read dissenting opinions, but including them just for the sake of a 50/50 argument is a very dangerous thing when one side is clearly right, and it's not a matter of opinion. Climate Change is a perfect example of this. I don't really care if your "opinion" is that it doesn't exist. Analysis (and anecdotal evidence) overwhelmingly points to the fact that it DOES. Same here. Analysis and logic overwhelmingly point to the conclusion that it is NOT a ponzi scheme. Even if someone has a 'feeling' that it is.

I would say this is generally true - but I would argue with your premise that bitcoins are an investment. Of course there are many speculators out there for whom it IS an investment - they are playing the market in the bitcoin commodity. But this is not necessarily the case with bitcoins.
For many people it can be looked at simply like another currency. You WOULDN'T say that having all your savings in one currency was such a bad idea, would you? There are people who keep all their money in USD, and there are people who speculate on USD FOREX values. It's really the same here - if you believe at all in bitcoin, and if you don't - then why would you be 'investing' in it at all anyway?

Why is it not feasible? I don't really have a position either way - frankly I don't know. But It is perfectly reasonable to me that BTC COULD become the world's currency. It's just as reasonable to me that it could become one of many world currencies. (though, it's not reasonable to me that it's going away anytime soon).
My point, though, is that simply stating that 'it will never happen' is a useless thing to say. Tell me why not. WHY won't/can't BTC become a/the world currency? There is less and less of a need for multiple currencies at all - and it seems to me quite unlikely that USD, EUR, or GBP will take over. It's not really logical that ANY sovereign state's currency would 'take over' - with the possible except of china's - in which case, BTC actually has a pretty good chance of surviving anyway.  So again - tell me WHY it's not feasible?

Lots of joking around in this thread, but here's a serious question I don't know the answer to- if i understand correctly, miners perform essential calculations for the bitcoin environment- basically acting like the clearinghouse for all transactions. In return they are compensated for contributing computing power by newer (albeit more difficult) bitcoins. so my question is- what happens after the last btc is mined? How are all the transactions kept in order without miners?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:51:35


Yes - this is true - but people forget that in fact, we only have about HALF of that number at the moment - and if Bitcoin gets adopted - the short term value will be that much HIGHER. I don't understand why all the price estimates which are based on dividing moneysupply/total always use 21million as the denominator. there won't be 21million coins for another 120 years. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:19:55
Your calculation assumes that there is no premium put on the utility of the coin or on its deflationary properties.  People will be willing to pay "more" for a coin that does a better job of preserving their wealth. Even at a point where the "calculated" value would be, say, $30k, if i were deciding to put my money somewhere (for the example's sake, let's just have two choices, fiat cash savings account, or bitcoin)- it would make sense for me to pay well above 30k per btc, so long as my expected return was more than what i would expect from my cash account.  - and that's not taking into consideration any if the other beneficial properties of btc that are valuable to me.  I would therefore conclude that the future price while dificult to predict, will be (many times?) higher than a simple moneysupply/btc would predict.   
Edit: also- we routinely see stocks trade at much more than their calculated "value" would suggest, simply because they are popular brands, or because of expected future value. - this explains today's cost of btc, people ate not paying 900$ for a "today" bitcoin- but 900 for a bitcoin from the future which they expect will cost more than 900.

Well good for you for changing your 'opinion', but it's not really a matter of what you, I, or anybody else 'thinks'. Of course, sentiment goes a long way in altering the speed with which it's adopted - admittedly - if nobody 'believed' in it, it wouldn't take off until (enough) people did. But the more proper term should be 'understand'. People understand or they don't. If you do some research and truly look at the facts, there is no alternative but to 'believe'.
Ask yourself honestly - under what condition or circumstance could/will bitcoin fail. You can research this, as people have made a lot of these lists about the negatives of bitcoin. And there are hurdles and difficulties, that's no secret. BUT - none of them (with the exception of two possibilities that i'll get to in a moment) mean the elimination of bitcoin. They all have really logical arguments and proofs against them.  (The only two ways that bitcoin could collapse is the exploitation of a yet unknown vulnerability in the protocol, or a collapse of the internet - any other arguments are things that would only decrease use/adoption)
Anyway, some analysis of what bitcoin (everything: the protocol, and the currency) is, leads to a very logical conclusion of FACT. it DOES fix and even eliminate a (number of) hurdles in commerce around which the entire financial system is built. That is an incredible thing. It potentially makes the entire financial industry, as well as a number of branches of contract law, completely obsolete. That is simply a fact that has already been demonstrated and is well beyond proof of concept. It's not a matter of opining. It's a matter of UNDERSTANDING.

None of these projections factor in 2 of the 3 sources of demand. They are all a calculation of bitcoin's worth as a 1) a disruptive payment network technology only.
Its value as "an alternative uncorrelated asset class", and "a safe haven currency", BOTH place an enormous multiplying premium on the 'cost' of one BTC (or any other commodity, really). The cost of gold and oil, for example, are many times greater than their utility would suggest. Also - there are many publicly traded companies whose shares are many multiples higher than their 'calculated' worth, because of a number of additional factors that put a premium on that stock.

challenges such powerful industries, it will face serious political opposition-- especially in the U.S. where those industries are strongest. 
strongest? you mean where banking is near collapse and would already have failed were it not for government intervention? where every second nyc corner has a TD (toronto dominion) bank because so many US banks Were on the verge of bankruptcy and  foreign banks swooped in to buy up the american scraps?

Yes, and what school did YOU go to? Your assessment is so blatantly false that it goes beyond 'obviously ridiculous'.  Price increase or drop is a function solely of sentiment. What do people THINK? If what your saying is correct, then the price would have risen on its own without the news getting out, since the supply/demand curve would have adjusted itself. Utter crap.

Because a credit union finances itself the same way that a real bank does (with the notable exception of most account fees). In essence, the account holders are the shareholders. But everything else is basically the same- the costs of running everything is still paid for from interest on lending. So for this to be viable you'd have to offer mortgages, credit cards, and other loans in btc. Not practical.

I dont understand these intermediary startups. honest question: what is their exit strategy? Are they honestly doing all this work in fundraising and infrastructure in order to serve a niche that will last a year or so at most? Basically- they are providing a "middleman service" (the absence of which is one of the reasons for bitcoin's existence) which will either make itself obsolete as retailers adopt btc, or be made obsolete if btc fails.

I think the article is well written, but seems to overlook some decidedly anti-socialist characteristics of btc.  Deflationary currencies amplify wealth disparity exponentially more than (our current) inflationary currencies. If you think "money makes money" now- it's nothing compared to a deflationary system where literally no attention must be paid to managing a fortune- the money will inherently be worth more without having to fight devaluation. Basically it eliminates the cost of estate management to "remaining rich". The more you have, the even more you will have. Full stop. Conversely, the less you have, the further behind you fall.
Deflationary currencies also increase the cost of borrowing by many times, even FURTHER reducing access to financing to the poor, working, and middle classes- since we now have to ADD deflation to the cost instead of subtracting inflation from it as we do today.
Sure, it takes control away from banksters. Great. You can even call it democratisation of the financial system. But it's not a one man one vote democracy. Money has always meant power- all that happens under a decentralized deflationary currency is that control is "democratically spread" to everybody **who has money** and taken away from banks, govs and reserves that control it. It becomes a one btc one vote democracy where "the rich" actually become MORE powerful (since they no longer have to follow banksters) financially on no basis other than account size.  
On balance, it's really incompatible with socialism and equality.

Why? Why does this worry you? Bitcoin has demonstrated that it can simultaneously perform a role as a store of value AND a role as a vehicle of commerce. These are not mutually exclusive properties.

wealth is relative, not absolute. no matter how much the poor save, the rich can save even more. this is true both nominally and as a percentage of income. so no matter what, you come out worse and worse the less you have.  and in any case, the poor historically dont save anyway.

What? What is "our community" that you speak of? It's like generalizing about the community of people who use USD. What a crock of shit. There is nothing inherently more charitable about bitcoin than there is about any other currency. And the community of early adopters and current users are certainly not held together by some moral compulsion to donate - indeed many newcomers are here as a result of pure greed. "One of the most beautiful attributes about Bitcoin is the charitable nature of our community" WHAAAAT?! this is unrelated to bitcoin. Rule number one: Never get emotional about your money. Yes - bitcoin makes it easier to transfer money from one place to another. THAT's it. Somebody could just as easily buy illegal drugs and weapons with it (GASP!). Get off your high-horse about some superior morality of bitcoin. It's more fair and it's more transparent. THAT is it's ethical superiority.
If you feel that more people should donate to charity (a position with with I happen to agree) then that's great. But it is unrelated to a particular currency or another.

People always make the same mistake when calculating the remittance market- that money is never in remittance at the same time.

I'm not saying oil is not valuable, we use it for almost everything, like you say - but its current price is independent of its cost of production and extraction.

Well, that's a question of what "using it" means. If you mean actually using it as currency, exchanging it for goods and services, that may be true. But i would argue that exchanging it for other currencies (which is what the speculators are doing) also constitutes "using it". And more and more people are doing that.  For some reason there are a lot of people talking in an A OR B tone- it's a currency OR it's a commodity. Why are these mutually exclusive?  If people are speculating in bitcoin- it doesnt change ANY of the currency attributes of bitcoin. It can and is still used to transfer value electronically.

Absolutely it is behaving like a commodity right now - that is obvious. Yes -  anybody who puts money into BTC these days (or has it there already) - even if they are doing it for 'currency' reasons, and not 'investment' reasons - expect appreciation of the asset. 
BUT -  I hear a lot of people saying this "once it stabilizes" stuff. There are two ways of interpreting that statement, and the ambiguity certainly adds to some confusion. Anyway, it can mean one of two things - 'once it's less volatile', and it can mean 'once it reaches a constant exchange rate'. The thing is that the first of these interpretations is irrelevant to whether it's a commodity or a currency (all currencies are volatile to a certain extent - and much of the volatility of BTC is due to the relatively TINY trading volumes. You can buy a billion USD without putting a dent in the rate - whereas if somebody wanted to buy or sell an equivalent value of bitcoins, it would completely drive markets insane (considering the current market cap of BTC is about 2.5 billion dollars).
 and the second interpretation will, by the nature of bitcoins' finite number, never happen. As long as it exists, it will always appreciate relative to other currencies - assuming that more people want to use it (more people want to buy than want to sell - which is what makes strong traditional currencies 'strong' anyway). What bitcoin DOESN'T have is a central bank / government that doesn't want a strong currency (which makes selling domestic goods very difficult). China's money is artificially undervalued - Canada's currency is artificially undervalued - so that they can export more. 
You mention that it's not yet an accepted currency. What do you imagine will happen once it is? Under no circumstances will it be any 'weaker' than it currently is. That will just make it stronger - which will make it more valuable relative to other currencies. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:36:37

You're right if you mean fractional reserve lending, but I believe the comment was meant simply for a 1 to 1 loan. In that case loans do increase the money supply for practical purposes. If it's hoarded and not loaned, then that amount of money is effectively out of circulation. If it's loaned out (presumably to be used for something), the money reenters circulation. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:36:51


Yes but, as I wrote above, they will be buying those consumables from other wealthy individuals (and or companies that are owned by wealthy individuals), who will then do something with that money - i.e. reinvest it.  This argument simply doesn't make sense.  And if the poor DO put their money into bitcoin, their contributions will be smaller nominally (as they will simply have less to invest), and those contributions will be a far higher percentage of their estates, meaning that the wealthy will STILL come out on top. 
Historically, who has invested more in anything? The wealthy - what makes you think bitcoin is any different? Suddenly poor people (or people who make financial decisions that make them poor) will start investing, and suddenly wealthy people who actually have financial prowess will start making bad investment decisions? This simply makes no sense.

I wonder if you realize that the whole 'too big to fail' fiasco happened because it turned out that none of the bank insurers could actually cover the losses - because they never expected to ever have to, so they weren't prepared to - that's why the Government had to bail out the banks. All of the banks were 'insured' and if insurance worked the way it was supposed to - then there would have been no need for the bailouts.
EDIT: (more) - The problem with bank insurance as opposed to, say, car insurance, is that it can never happen that EVERY car is totalled on the same day. Insurance cannot handle scenarios where all policies need to be paid at the same time (this is why home insurance doesn't cover natural disasters). But if any reasonably sized or larger bank fails - then it results in a ripple affect causing all other banks to collapse as everybody goes to withdraw. So bank insurance is a crock of shit.

The fact that 'bitcoin can' - is a nonstarter for the first (couple of?) generation(s) if users. While it's still being adopted, by definition, more people will start using it. This will result in a net flow of capital FROM other currencies TO bitcoin. This simple flow differential will cause the value of bitcoin to change (rise). This can only be stopped when an equilibrium is reached such that the net capital being used to buy BTC equals the amount of BTC being converted back to other currencies. Simple supply and demand. Since it is just being adopted now - as long as it survives - the value (relative to other currencies) will rise. In the short and medium terms, the rise will be made volatile by speculators who aren't buying it as a currency but as a commodity, but the simple supply and demand curve still applies. 
Yes - "bitcoin could be worth 50 percent less". Certainly - but it can also be worth 50 percent more - and any such change is a function of speculation generated volatility, and unrelated to the mathematical truth that given a condition where bitcoin continues to be adopted, it's average value will increase relative to other currencies.
