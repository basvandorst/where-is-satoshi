I understand your point and will discuss the implementation of BIP0038 in Verso Wallet with our engineers. The major issue is that the key derivation function is computation/memory intensive, which is hard to deal with on a smartphone.

Thank you for your feedback. We are in the process of releasing a video soon.

Thank you for your comment, donnlee!
The only reason that prevents us from doing BIP0038 today is how computation (and memory) intensive it is. It might work on recent mobile phones, but not everybody has a brand new iPhone or Android device, unfortunately. We have to consider this user base.
We are thinking about making the app BIP0038 compatible so that it can be used with bitaddress and other standard cold wallet solutions for those who are willing to. We will also investigate the possibility of BIP0038 cards with lower iteration parameters.

Verso Gold cards have two major differences.
i) the private side of Verso Gold cards contains a fragment (using Shamir's secret sharing) of your private key only; the other fragment is kept in our databases (and communicated to you separately so that you do not depend on us). This way, we can implement two-factor authentication and monitor/counter potential (brute-force) attacks.
ii) Verso Gold are backed on our side in multiple Swiss bank vaults using Shamir's secret sharing algorithm.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:19:28
Short answer: yes.
Verso Silver cards store all information you need to access your wallet. You do not need Verso servers for critical operations (managing your wallet, sending funds, ...).
Long answer: it is definitely possible but we have not yet developed an automatic tool to convert our specification to other wallet import formats. For this reason, you would need to do it manually using our open-source libraries.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:48:01
Thank you for your message. Our previous shipments to the UK took three to four business days. Please let us know if it lasts any longer.
You may easily verify that no information is sent at the time of order by looking at the scripts or checking our open-source libraries. Unfortunately, we cannot formally prove that the app you download on the store also holds this promise. For this reason, we try to be very transparent by publishing most of our source codes and by answering to our customers here. Also, please note that our company was founded by serious people and is well capitalized as you may verify in the Registre du Commerce suisse: we would have everything to lose by being dishonest about our products.

In contrast to most competing solutions, your private key is not persisted on an electronic device. It is thus immune to hacking, hard drive crashes, etc. It provides the same advantages as paper wallets (see, e.g.,  but with the convenience and resilience of a polycarbonate credit card-sized medium.

We store an encrypted seed on the card that is compatible with BIP0032 specification. Currently, only one deterministically derived key-address couple is used, and the change is sent back to that same address. We are working on a fully deterministic implementation that will not reuse old addresses and will be compatible with the current cards.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:36:15
Thank you for your feedback, OGshatter.
The specification of the Verso Gold card is very different. Verso Silver is a self-sufficient product storing the encrypted private key directly, whereas Verso Gold stores a fragment of the key only (the rest of it being stored on our database). The idea is that (i) some users prefer keeping full control (and responsibility!) on their key and being fully anonymous, while (ii) other users are less concerned about where and how the key is stored, as long as it is highly secure.
Verso Silver is the solution for type (i). Verso Gold is the solution for type (ii). Verso Gold doesn't store the same information as Verso Silver. Consequently, the cards aren't interchangeable.
Verso Gold cards will also cost $16.99, but an (low) annual management fee will be charged for the additional services (incl. backup).
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:55:45
Thank you for your feedback, enmaku.
We are very well aware of the key derivation theory and the difference between scrypt and PBKDF2 functions. We might consider scrypt in the future but it is not realistic to implement BIP0038 as a standard on smartphones at the time because of the computation time required.
Please also note that competing solutions such as blockchain.info do use PBKDF2 too. Notably, blockchain.info has a much lower iteration parameter by default (N=10) unless they changed their policy, which makes their solution less secure than Verso Silver cards against brute-force/dictionary attacks for most users.
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:29:33
Yes, you can. Please have a look at my previous answer here: 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:35:56
Our design allows for BIP32 determinism and we are working on releasing this feature in order to improve anonymity.
Concretely, using a different address for change has mainly two implications:
1. it increases anonymity (yet, rarely achieves it)
2. it keeps the public key secret until first outgoing transaction (yet, this makes absolutely no practical difference until there are quantum computers out there, and also it does not hide the public key for other unspent outputs of the same address).
Most wallet providers reuse addresses multiple times by default (e.g., blockchain.info, multiple exchanges). There is no security risk if properly implemented as ECDSA-256 is extremely secure. Verso Wallet uses multiple sources of randomness (incl. accelerometer + dev/urandom) to guarantee that the random number used to sign the transaction has 256 bits of entropy. An alternative could be to implement RFC 6979 to remove all entropy considerations but it is not useful in our context.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:24:36
Thank you again for your comments. I agree with you that Verso Gold will probably have multiple use cases and won't be limited to long term savings.
Let me just make it clear that Verso Gold is not an online wallet. The information we store on our servers is useless for an attacker as long as he doesn't additionally steal both your card and your password. Stealing the information we have in our database only reduces the security of Verso Gold to a Verso Silver. This is due to the "information-theoric security" of Shamir's secret sharing algorithm.
The major difference in terms of usage is that a Verso Gold users need to keep the second fragment of the key separate from the card in order to be independent of our servers (say, if you think our company might disappear); the card only holds half of the information.
In addition, we use the same concept for backups. Your (encrypted) key is split in multiple independent fragments that are dispatched into separate bank vaults. The information in one particular vault is useless for a hacker unless he (i) steals your card or (ii) steals the content of another bank vault; in either of these two cases, the security reduces to the theft of your Verso Silver: it is still password-protected.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:14:56
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:09:40
We do not think our approach is better than BIP0038. It is just more pragmatic for mobile phone users currently. Please read my answer to donnlee above for more details.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:07:41
Actually, we thought about Verso Silver and Verso Gold the opposite way. The additional security against theft/loss of Verso Gold makes it ideal for long term storage. However, the relative downside of this approach is that the user has to agree that his card only stores part of the information, the second part being stored on our servers (but also communicated to the user separately -- yet not directly on the card). Again, this is a kind of tradeoff: are you confident enough you can deal with these security issues yourself, or are you willing to delegate this responsibility to Verso Solutions. We think our customers will decide based on this criterion.

Thank you. We won't hesitate to redo an AMA in the future if it seems necessary.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:09:42
This service is pretty expensive on our side as we have to gather fragments of your card from multiple banks in different locations and in a secure way. It will be hard for us to lower these costs, at least initially. We are considering the possibility of offering a new Verso Gold card in case of a loss.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:06:11
Thank you for your feedback. Our solution does not lock yourself as we provide the full source code of our encryption and serialization process. We will consider BIP0038 in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:44:53
dexX7,chocos: We will discuss your suggestions with our engineers. I think you raise a good point. Please follow us on Twitter to get the latest news about our products. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:52:43
Our major issue with BIP0038 is the computation/memory complexity of the key derivation function (with "standard" parameters) that is very high for a smartphone. I will discuss this possibility with our employees.
EDIT: We may also propose an offline tool to generate / encrypt private data using our own specification. This way, you would have a pure offline generation, yet compatible with our solution.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:42:17
Thank you for your order, Itogo.
It is indeed possible to generate offline wallets without buying the card as our product is fully open-source. You might miss some features (e.g., account name, and others in the futures) that are dependent on our server, though.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:03:26
- No modification of the specification is planned at the time. If we were to make some modifications in the specification of the future versions, we would make sure that old versions still work as well as they do currently.
- If the app is pulled from the app store, we will do our best to quickly provide a fully working thin-client solution. The major limitations with such an approach are the following: (i) QR-code scanners are pretty primitive (ii) some features such as access to clipboard are not available (iii) it would definitely prevent us from doing BIP0038 in the future as javascript implementations have terrible performance.
- We have been testing our cards for six months on a daily basis and they passed several resilience tests (e.g., UV exposure) successfully.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:38:29
Verso Cards are offline wallets for your bitcoins. In that sense, they are very similar to bitaddress.org wallets.
The major advantage of Verso Cards over other cold storage solutions is the ease with which it lets you use your bitcoins securely. First, the format of the card is very practical and more resilient than a paper wallet. Second, and most importantly, we provide mobile apps that let you manage and spend bitcoins of your card: your mobile is synchronized with the card wallet.
Additionally, the release of Verso Gold cards will offer a cheap yet extremely secure solution for long-term storage. It will be immune against loss, and will provide additional security mechanisms against brute-force and other dictionary attacks.
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:19:12
Thank you for your feedback.
We only had a partial support for P2SH addresses in the current release. We are about to publish an updated version but it might take several days to reach the iOS store; it will be faster on Android though. We are sorry for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:27:02
This is surprising. Can you give me more information about yourself? Phone version and country in particular?
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:35:22
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:08:14
There is a [Tutorial page]( on the VersoCards website, you may try the product by yourself without waiting.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:55:40
Yes, shipping is free with no limitation.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:01:03
We are considering an offline script to generate and encrypt the keypair according to our specification, that you could then send to us.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:36:49
The major difference is that we use PBKDF2 key derivation function rather than scrypt. Another difference is the way we serialize the encrypted key in the QR code. We're considering switching to a BIP0038-compatible implementation in the future, though. Can you please give me a use case for your second bullet point?
EDIT: Now I understand your second point. Please read my answer to ItsMillerIndexTime below.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:47:46
The card name is only shown in-app. Choose it carefully as you will see it every time you run the app!

Unfortunately, it seems our payment provider has some issue processing payments since Friday. We will do our best to solve the problem today. Thank you for your patience.
One more argument in favor of bitcoin technology...
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:15:41
The private side is encrypted and cannot be used without your password. It is comparable to a BIP38 paper wallet in that sense.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:31:41
Extracting the private key of your card is pretty simple for an engineer as the product is completely open-source. I agree it is not sufficient though - in particular as the goal of our company is to allow non-technicians to use bitcoin securely - and will discuss the implementation of a separate offline script with our developers this week. Thank you for your feedback.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:12:59
You should receive your card very soon!
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:12:16
It's hard to say and we hope it will survive this thread.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:29:04
Thank you for your comment. I understand your concerns with the AppStore and I hope our app can survive.
The private side of your Verso Card stores an encrypted version of your private key (formally: a seed from which a private key / address couple is derived using BIP0032). Scanning the QR code allows the app to identify your wallet address and some private information (e.g., your account name), and store the encrypted key in memory until you log out.
Currently, there is only one wallet associated to a card.
The Verso Gold cards will be released within the next two months.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:08:45
That is the precise reason why we provide the Verso Gold alternative (to be released soon). Verso Gold cards are backed up in Swiss bank vaults and thus immune to loss.
Also, our form factor makes it very easy to backup a Verso Silver too by simply copying the private side of the card. Users do not have to keep a digital copy as a simple paper photocopy is sufficient. Yet, if they want to keep a digital copy, the solution is still as secure as alternatives such as blockchain.info wallets. With Verso Cards, we let the user decide, but we favor the cold storage approach.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:49:55
Glad to hear it! Our previous shipments arrived in 3 to 7 days in the US.

We are happy to announce Verso Cards and Verso Wallet, the first products of Verso Solutions. Our products combine a cold storage wallet for securing bitcoins and a smartphone app to easily manage them. 
Verso Cards are high security credit card-sized wallets for your bitcoins. They allow you to carry your bitcoins wherever you go without fear of hackers.  The front side reveals the address of your card encoded in a QR code, allowing people to send you bitcoins with any bitcoin software. The back side of the card stores a strongly encrypted version of your private key that can only be used with your password. 
Verso Wallet is the first cross-platform mobile bitcoin wallet (available on iOS and Android, and soon on WP8). It provides all the management features of your Verso Card, from checking your balance and the last transactions, to sharing your address or sending bitcoins. It is as easy as it seems: scan the back side of your Verso Card and you're in your wallet. 
I'm happy to answer any of your questions about the products.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:17:06
We do not have access to the user passwords nor to the private key.
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:30:16
Thank you for your very funny feedback!
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:33:37
Thank you for using our products, we are happy you have a good experience with them.
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:17:30
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:44:17
Not exactly. We love bitcoin technology and think the major obstacle for mainstream adoption is how hard it is to manage bitcoins securely. We hope our solution contributes to solving this issue and helps bitcoin move forward.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:22:51
The process is very similar. The major differences between a Silver and a Gold card are software.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:38:48
Glad you like it, thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:21:23
Verso Solutions never sees your sees your private key. The private key is never communicated to any server. It is encrypted with your password at the time of order and our factory only knows about the encrypted version of the private key (as it has to print it on the card). Additionally, the encrypted private key is subject to an additional layer of (asymmetric) encryption between your browser and our secure factory, preventing any attacker to steal it.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:29:20
Our credit card payment provider will fix the issue within the next hours. Do not hesitate to come back on Verso Cards website later today.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:46:22
Thank you for your feedback, Sephyre.
1) Verso Cards work together with the Verso Wallet app. The app lets you manage your wallet / make transactions similarly to other desktop or mobile wallets.
2) We will soon release a video about the products. Unfortunately, it is not available yet. I'm happy to give you more information of the products in the meantime.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:48:13
Thank you. We currently rely on blockchain.info services and they seem to be down at the time. We will add secondary data providers in order to be hedged against such scenarios. Please come back and visit us later today, we will fix the issue as quickly as possible.
