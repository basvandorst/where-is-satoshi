It is consistent. Just not statistically relevant.

great idea. just did that. maybe someone should open a new thread so this gets more exposure!
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:54:16
yes looks normal now
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:38:30
looks totally messed for me

as i understand it, "ready" means the changes are already prepared and ready for deployment. What you describe fits under the "planned" flag.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:02:50
ok, i get what you're saying now. makes sense!

I think what he means is that the exchanges waited for some kind of reference implementation with which they can validate their work before deploying it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:54:26
what is the most reasonable option to choose there?

Well, if the NSDAP still existed, you probably would. The governments in those countries are new. That bank is not.

and because of that he is not allowed to criticize him?
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:24:03
yea i don't approve his comment either. just wanted to point out that what you said should not be used as an argument.

I think a PoW change could then be performed rendering their newly acquired hardware worthless.

I think most people keep the coins on the exchange to be able to trade them straight when they want to. If the exchange keeps them in a separate user-controlled wallet, the coins have to be transferred back to the exchange wallet before they can be traded again.
I would certainly not use it because it prevents me from directly trading the coins at the exact times i want them to trade.

there are lots of people that missed the train last time because exchanges were not verifying them. those accounts should be verified by now, so they might jump into the next upwards trend.

then you don't need a blockchain ^^
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:21:02
blockchains need a valuable token though.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:19:33
yes i agree with you, maybe you misunderstood my post. what i was trying to say is that a PoW change keeps the blockchain alive which makes the attack not a 100% success in destroying bitcoin (well, the price probably plummets and the question is how new miners can be acquired).

from those that sold them their btc at 20k. they are now buying back in.
