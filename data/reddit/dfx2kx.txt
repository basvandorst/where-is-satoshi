If you did, I didn't see (goes to roam though the Reddit account, doesn't often mess with the PMs and what not, thanks in advance, though)

by metric of physical production, we buy more stuff then we make. Which is fine, until you reach the point where nobody wants your money anymore.
Is that going to happen 'any day now'? unlikely, but it is a risk.

Not a texan, but I wish you all the best, sir. Need more people of a younger generation to get into politics.
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:37:01
I think the newer generations tend to care less about who you are, where you come from, what you do in you spare time, what you own, what you smoke (if anything), or who you sleep with. Provided none of these things ruin anyone else's day, nobody cares. I think that's a good thing.
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:33:47
that's like one user here, who gave me $5 of it to get started. I'm just keeping it stored at the tip exchange it came from for the moment, though

having financial trasactions monitored off the internet, or a loss of some portion of the internet itself could do the trick.

Taking it myself, now, it does seem to be pretty good. I like the way the instructor explains stuff.
(and I built a 'hardware' OTP chiper system in Logisim, for which I'm immensely pleased)
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:50:57
That's an interesting architecture for all sorts of uses, actually.... That almost sounds like you could use it to operate other distributed-load services, as well.

not all the time, and not in every situation, but yes, they've protected the value of the dollar by force in places. Now, we do it by diplomacy. The one thing people still need the dollar for is oil, and there are agreements in place to keep it that way.
The moment THAT situation changes, no army in the world is going to save the US dollar. It's not necessarily that spending more then you take in (which is what you do at times with a fiat currency) is bad, in and of itself. But you have to be careful what you spend that excess ON. If we where spending it on industry and infrastructure, our economy would be at least as good as China's. However, we didn't. and it'll be a handy excuse for other countries to take us down a few notches.

Probably is, but it could take a century or more to fully collapse. a currency backed my guns and drones has more value then one without.
I'll keep the mBTC I've got, but digital currency (and Bitcoin in particular) won't be going anywhere.
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:06:18
I see that, there. So this is actually stored as bitcoins then, eh? So they handle all of the wallet and block-chain stuff, too then? Interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:16:01
haha, yeah. I just chuckle every time I see one (still have a 486 that works, mess with it, now and again, when I get it out of the attic, I suppose it's the part of me that likes to keep old stuff running until it falls apart)
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:46:37
have an upvote for the socket 7 board in the window. It's good to see, even as a non-bitcoin user.
@_date: 2014-04-05 10:03:49
Oh, okay. That makes sense. Bitcoin's concepts are slowly making more sense to me, what with using Bit-message and other systems like it. I appreciate the info (and practice mBTC, which I'm going to be careful with until I can make sure I don't loose anything, which will be when I'm not sleepy :D)
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:38:20
I'm guessing that's most of this crowd, actually. Someone here gave me a few mBTC (shoutout to him), but I'd not dump my whole paycheck into a first generation cryptocurrency. If it truly nosedives (unlikely) I might pick up some more to sell back when the price goes higher. might not, though.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:08:23
ooooh, I might have to take a peek at that! Even though I don't have bitcoin myself, I find Crypto fascinating.
@_date: 2014-08-14 05:07:16
I'm not sure having his endorsement is a good thing...
@_date: 2013-06-04 07:03:53
where did you find those ribbon cables? O_O That's genious
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:25:57
ohhhh, okay, that makes sense. So you just have to get a public address, find someone to send you some mBTC or whatever, and then you have the keys in that file nessicary to spend that currency or trade it with someone.

Those people have been saying stuff like that for years, it would be nothing new. The same batch that thought Ronald Regan was the the antichrist.
Anyone who'd assume Bitcoin would be the fabled 'One world currency' of the bible doesn't understand the nature of the text very well (and makes some of us who do shake our heads with the 'we're not with him' expression.)
Are there world organizations out there that I'd be concerned about? Yes, yes there are (The UN isn't one of them, and neither is Bitcoin)
I think the barrier to entry is just the process itself, for a lot of people. I know people have 'wallets' but I don't even know how/where you'd issue one, securely, and very little about how one even puts money in it. :D
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:49:41
oh, okay! yeah, the difference is confusing to anyone who doesn't follow bitcoin too closely.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:42:51
oh, okay, that makes sense, then, like an encrypted email key then. cool.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:12:18
okay, my dumb question for the day. What exactly constitutes a wallet (from my understanding, it's some sort of file that says how many bitcoins you have, and their ID or something), and how does one put a any btc into it, and where would one get such, in the US?
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:23:17
there is that. Also, it's a bit confusing to newbies like myself (who don't have a wallet/don't know where you'd even get one), whereas cash (or ammo, that's more valuable then cash right now) can be handed to whomever for whatever one wants. That, and usually just use my credit card, Bitcoin isn't that convenient.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:17:07
There's always that, yeah. Assume any system you use is compremised, and that any leak you see is leaked for a reason (Either they've already broken it, but are trying to hide that, or have no f-ing clue who is who, and what to hide that), and then play it on the safe side.
@_date: 2013-09-12 04:27:16
There is a key difference between the global currency in Revelations, and something like, say, Bitcoin. Nothing in Bitcoin MAKES you use it. It was the only existing legal tender in the Revelations' case.
Bitcoin (or something like it) would have a lot of advantages, but could also bring about some very serious issues. It's known to be working on a limited pool, now that's good for anti-inflation. but if enough people use it, you might have people (or governments, who'd have the initial funds to buy in.) hoarding shitloads of BTCs, and causing deflation. And then there's the fact that the networks it relies on are about as private and secure as a Roman Bathhouse. That latter bit is what's kept me out of the market. If I wanna keep something private, I use cash or trade for something.
Of course, I know very little about bitcoin, but that's my assumptions just form what I DO know.
@_date: 2013-09-13 06:47:48
I'll have to look that up. I suppose a lot of it would depend on how the prices of items and services responded to the chance in supply... Doesn't Bitcoin divide up into much smaller units then old school currencies? if so, the effects wouldn't be as bad.
