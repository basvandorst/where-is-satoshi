your suggestions are good (thanks), but they're also "don't use your bank for this feature", which qualifies my argument the bank is failing to provide an acceptable service. 
I give them access to my money which they can invest and loan in order to turn profit, and in return, they (theoretically) make it easy and accessible to me in the current market - something my UK bank has been laughably shit at. When we've reached the point that you can sit on your couch with your laptop and book return flights and accommodation to anywhere in the world in under 10 mins, and often under £100, there is absolutely no excuse for your bank not to offer a fair and competitive international service.
UK banking is expensive, convoluted, and 100% focused on the bank turning profit and protecting themselves. I have never, ever felt that they did something because it aided me, only that it aided them in retaining me as a customer, or somehow deducting more money from me.
The takeaway from this is that UK very much could benefit from cryptocurrency, if for no other reason than to give the banks a reason to charge fair and reasonable fees.

But shockingly high international ATM fees


But significant to wire to commonwealth countries 


Bit my card was caught by a skimmer in France and blocked, and the process of getting a new one without going back to the UK is almost impossible 


Provided you're a UK citizen. If you're here on a work visa, that'll be £12/mth, assuming you can convince a bank to give you an account 
One last note, bank savings accounts don't even offer a high enough interest rate to compete with inflation. 
.. I hate UK banking.
