i dont know about salving problems, but it will certainly SOLVE a lot of problems such as:
-network congestion
-high fees
-adoption by various e-commerce

You must be new here. This hasn’t been about freedom since the concept that you can make money with bitcoin hit the main stream. It was sad to see the initial inspiration of crypto currency get caught in this mess. I hope that by correcting we can return to the concept of “this is a currency meant to be used” vs “this is an investing tool for gains”
