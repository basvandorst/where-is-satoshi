Same sitation 2 days ago but instead of using bank transfer i used debit card even though the fee was incredibly high, but I was willing to risk that since the run up has been insane. Recuperated the fee in like 5 hours lol, now the rest well I' m taking my profit since this sunday and the 18th will bring in new money. I want to see how it will affect it.

Well then think about this. Hundreds of smaller firms and hedge funds adopting the idea of bitcoin and continuing its push to actual implementation. As well as those huge companies that adopt and begin using it in some way slowly they will be at an advantage unlike the big firms going against it. It’s like a wave just coming over you.

and you were right. 11-12k in December 5. I'd rather catch a wave up and make some profits than miss out on a huge opportunity.

you are right. But did you see the news lately? Lightning protocol 1.0 just dropped and can be immediately implemented into bitcoin main network. Which means transactions will be completed way faster.

Mmm just use JavaScript and do a simple google search on how to reveal images slowly in html and JS that should give you the underlying code the. Grab the image with JS or Jquery and it should work.

But opacity is the whole image it’s not slowly revealing the image say from top to bottom or idk if that’s what you guys meant

Just like warren buffet says when everybody is greedy be cautious but when everybody is afraid(like right now) you be aggressive. I made a quick flip those few days when btc was blasting off like space x but we knew that had to stop and drop. Normal people with mortgages and life savings working in other industries putting all this money into btc and boom.
