LMAO people encouraging the OP to get his own bitcoin wallet while the guy doesn't even understand where his bitcoins are stored right now and that changing his hard drive is totally irrelevant in this case.
Mate, just DON'T MOVE your bitcoins off Coinbase if you don't understand how bitcoin works, what a ledger and a priv key are, and how to keep your funds safe with multiple, encrypted backups.
"Being your own bank" require knowledge and skills, and just put you at risk of losing your funds if you don't know how to secure it.

Bitfimex and co liquidating as much short and long positions as they can before the final run away.
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:41:36
You got bitcoinected
@_date: 2019-08-10 06:32:02
It's just bitfinex and co manipulating the price to liquidate the max number of positions, shorts and longs.

Links to child porn. Does it make any difference?

From the paper:


Since its on the blockchain, it can be easily verified, and the paper will certainly be reviewed anyway. So... It's paid FUD?
Maybe you're just inconfortable with the *fact* that the BTC blockchain can store such content, and that it's obviously a pb.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:30:43




I don't. But measures are taken on the Internet again people that do illegal activities such as this one. You don't ignore it, do you? I'm sure you don't.


Sure. Doesn't mean we can't discuss it or try to find a way to solve such issues.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:18:04
"My campaign". Lol. I own BTC personaly. And I don't belong to any organization running FUD campaign or whatever.
I'm concerned by the way this sub acts, and by the pb of arbitray content on blockchain in general.
But yeah, "my campaign"...
Good luck on burying your head in the sand.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:00:20


Could be. But it's just an hypothesis with nothing to back it. Conspiracy theory isn't an answer to everything.
It's a fact that the market is heavily manipulated though and quite obvious that there's organized FUD campains running regularly. But oyu can't blame it all on it. In this case, the pb exists and is concerning.




Indeed, and it's one of the pb I wanted to point out. You have to search the topic to find a meaningful post. But the shitpost hasn't been deleted or even flagged, sure not! Why would someone want to do that with a post intentionnaly calling "child porn" "porn"... And why would someone being shocked to see a post like that with almost 1k upvotes?
Well, sorry, but I am.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:25:30
I'm not "whining". I call for a grown-up discussion about it. 
Unfortunately I'm not a dev. I don't have a solution here. I don't think it would be an easy one that you can find in 5 minutes anyway, nah?
Since you ask me, what's your solution? Make a joke of it? Acting as if nothing happened? Tell people that they're whining when they ask for a meaningful talk?
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:49:11


Thanks. Nice and constructive answer here. 


I would not be happy with that for sure. Some people would probably do so, yeah.     


It is a possibility indeed. I guess we'll never know.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:52:04
Your post is a shame.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:45:07
Sorry if it has been posted multiple times. There's a LOT of submissions going on continously and I couldn't check them all.
Actually I came accross the post I mentionned, which is on the front page of and got sick about it. Where are the other posts really discussing these pb seriously? Show me, cause in the first pages I've seen nothing about that.
My goal was more to have some feedback of the community on this matter and express how I was shocked by this post.
But yeah, it's nice to have a shitpost with 800+ upvotes on your frontpage, let's downvote people like me pointing that out, and call them "whiners". Very constructive.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:34:44


Again, as you said yourself, it's been heavily censored/deleted. But again, not the shameful post on the BTC frontpage ofc... If you're good with it...


It's not a campaign. Can't we discuss openly on this sub? How ironic is that the freedom kingdom of BTC also has one of the most heavily censored sub out there...


Stay polite please.


Oh no pb really. I already knew how this community behaves. Censorship, censorship, censorship! "Arbitrary content" is the new "block size" here it seems. (Just to be clear: I don't support Bcash in any way). Deal with your bad faith.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:51:26


Sorry to hear that you did a burn-out.


It doesn't prevent from discussing the issue. It's what a community is about. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:32:54
Yeah, discussing this pb is trolling. I wonder if you're not the troll here, actually.
"Hey, this guy want to discuss a real issue with the way the blockchain is used, it's FUD, he's a troll"
Gimme a break.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:50:01


Sure, I never said otherwise.
What I say is the pb of arbitrary content must be adressed and solved. For the sake of BTC and Blockchain.
And that I don't like to see such a disgusting post in the front page of this sub.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:38:23
Agreed, and it surely has been done already.
Remains the question on how to prevent these kind of arbitrary content from being stored on blockchains in the future.
And how a post where someone call child porn "porn" still gets so many upvotes. But I've understood it's not a priority to deal with it here and that a lot of people seem to be comfortable with it.

It's tether, stupid!
