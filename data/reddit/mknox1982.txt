The issue I have with considering this argument is that unlike gold or other property left in a persons house, the original owner too may still have a copy of the private key - so it would be more like being in possession of a possibly shared asset.  When did control of an asset mean complete ownership?
Another analogy would be like buying a purse and finding the keys to a house hidden/lost inside.  Certainly the person finding them would not instantly become entitled to squatting on any house which can be entered by the keys, even if the original owners lack of such key would force the rightful owner to have to abandon the house without ever being able to enter it again.  I know this analogy has problems too, but with work I think it displays a point.

In relation to a zero basis...  Are there any rules against considering a gift of bitcoins as selling some amount of bitcoin for an unreasonably small amount (say nothing or a penny)?  In such a case, the person gifting the coin would realize it as a loss (for taxation purposes) and the person inheriting it would see a nearly zero basis as described.   I assume it is not allowed, but how can the law prohibit a person from selling something at a complete loss?
I realize its highly unlikely to be allowed due to the ramifications it would allow (possibly indefinetely defer paying taxes), however I am curious of how it is prohibited by taxation rules.

In a technical sense, all they have access to is the hash of your public key.   The hash is formed from using sha256 and ripemb160 hash functions along with base 58 encoding of the public key which is based on a digital signature algo using elliptical curves (the private key essentually derives the public key in an almost irreversable way).   If youve ever spent any any coins from the address, your public key is no longer hidden behind these hashes as a result of the signature verification process, however is still essentually impossible to brute force.   It could be considered more secure to keep the coins behind an address never spent from in case ECDSA were to somehow be broken, but even that is a far stretch.   Either way, Id say your coins are more secure than your vehicle outside in relatiin to getting stolen overnight or the next plane you ride possibly crashing.  More likely than being brute forced is that your private keys get stolen/copied by malware etc rather than figuring it out from the address or public key-this depends on how secure your computer is.
Im not an expert in the subject, this is just my understanding from what ive picked up.  Anyone with more familiarity, please advise if any points ive made are incorrect.

Volatility as measured by the standard deviation of growth rate doesn't imply that growth causes volatility.  High volatility implies that the growth rate is changing a lot.  As the market cap gets larger, it will take more money (buying and selling) to have an impact on price.

I think one point many people are missing is that by forming a syndicate of bidders, most individuals must of joined in hopes of getting coins at a price lower than the market value.  I say this because each of the actors (by themselves) still had/have the ability to purchase their desirable sum of coins directly from a market.   Just my opinion, but i have difficulty seeing a bunch of small investors getting together to pay over market price for a sum of coins they could get on the market for cheaper.
I'm still bullish on btc and dont want to kill the party, but this is the only logical progression I could put smaller actors forming a syndicate acting on.  
Anyone with some insight, please inform me because i may have misinterpretted the way secondmarket functions.

I dont want to get involved with this argument by arguing.  
I believe you bring up a very good point about how it should only take 2^160 private keys to create any public address due to the use of RIPEND160 (if i understand things correctly).  However I do think it is important to consider that the number of private keys (in a general sense) are related to the Order which is defined by the elliptical curve parameters.  My understanding for the reduction is due to the way addresses are set up in bitcoin (using hash functions) and not ECDSA.
Anyhow, Im not one to argue over this and I have enjoyed your past videos and hope you continue in them.  I too saw the 160 bits you mentioned in the video and had to think about it before realizing the steps you skipped (or didnt explain) to arrive there.
Anyhow keep up the good work.

Think of convenience...  Any time a cashier or whoever tells you hoe much u owe, the would have to say a decimal number which can be awkward for those involved prikarily outside the sciences...   In casual conversation, speaking of decimals seems awkward.
Additionally, in most crafts the laymen speak in terms of units such that the number is on an order of magnitude which moat people have intuition with (from my experience).  It sorta awkward like forcing a chemist expressing small to express how much a small sample weighs in metric tons.  While an interesting mind experience most currently involved with btc have done, it can be a little difficult and painful for casual use.
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:54:42
I like your graphics.  If your looking for additional ideas, I think including elliptical curve shapes into the graphics graphics would be something neat to add due to the concept being used in ECDSA with bitcoin.

I didn't mean to imply I thought you did say a cryptocurrency couldn't survive if it's deflationary.  I was just trying to add some thought I had to the conversation as it's not uncommon to hear the claim that a currency must be deflationary.

No disagreement but the issue I see with economics of scale is that nuclear plants are multibillion dollar widgets with max volumes in the triple (maybe quadruple) digits making it very hard to work numerous generations through at cost structures initially having alpha-stage costs10x or so higher (also with mass uncertainty) than latter term plants.  
Great promise is in research but it's gonna take a breakthrough more so than incremental improvement to happen in the next few generations (imo).  
As far as how China does it, I have no opinion as well with how they produce lots of stuff cheaply.  Also, I find the claim of saying they do it at safety levels in practice currently acceptable to be a claim without enough time under the belt to be certain of.  I know little of the industry there but haven't heard any talk of it in my past working in nuclear.  Are you sure of your facts in that claim?
Edit. China with 37 reactors with probably under 30 years each on average is around 1000 reactor years.  This successful history is far from enough time to insure suitable safety levels as safety requisites (imo) should prove on the order of a million reactor years as well as resilience to major initiating events, some unanticipated scenarios, as well as acts of sabatoge (and possibly in these days terror etc).  I go this far as cause with renewables as a comparison these low probability extreme scenarios of consideration do not exist.
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:37:24
Just a thought...
The view that a cryptocurrency must be inflationary to survive imo fails to consider it as a new asset class which is/can operate in tandem with inflationary currencies.  Granting individuals the availability to use multiple currencies is important to consider as the old inflationary-vs-deflationary argument typically holds onto the constraint of a singular currency available to users .  Current cryptocurrency usage now allows removal of this old constraint of the past where individuals only had a single currency to use (based on their jurisdiction).  The economics of things now seem to have another degree of freedom to how they could play out.  This makes it even harder to  constrain to a particular dynamic as a previous constraint has been removed which opens up more the space to a bigger playing field.  I'd argue more freedoms aka less constraints is a good thing.  
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:12:59
It may be but after working in the industry when it was trying to take off again, I have to say that the economics get unwieldy when considering safety at the current state of the technology as I saw....  projects initially with $10B &amp; ~6 year timelines seeing both numbers double before further takeoff to fruition (especially in the wake of recent incidents) which can find difficulty with funding.
I am for nuclear, but I haven't seen a good case for it achieved recently that is also economically sensible.

I dont know your location, but if you are holding less than $200 USD (or that order) then I would suggest holding it on an account such as Coinbase (strickly if you are in the US).  If you are in another country, it would take looking at the specific countries options.  I am not normally one to suggest holding money on an online exchange but considering the upfront effort and risks associated with storing yourself its hard to push too far one way another.  Now if you plan on using this opportunity as a learning experience and plan on increasing your holdings then take others advise answering your question directly as asked.  I prefer hardware wallets myself but those have a \~$50 entry level and are not perfect themself.

I agree that privacy would be a concern.  While I am not an expert on the topic, I do believe using https would mitigate most of the risk associated with using a shared wifi network.  Sure it is risky to log into account over a strangers internet connection, however I think such a concern ignores how data is transferred over the internet after passing through the strangers internet connection.  To summarize my point/suggestion, a person should take into consideration that information sent over the internet still maintains its vulnerabilities after passing through a single strangers access point.  Just a thought.   I hope I didn't misinterpret your point.

I just wanted to post they lyrics for reference:
Songwriters: JOEL, BILLY
There's a place in the world for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 
Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 
I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was right or wrong. 
And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
His honor is pure, and his courage as well 
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man. 
There's a place in the world for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

Ah, it doesn't matter - either way I'd be happy. I just want some memorabilia related to Bitcoin and don't mind helping you fund whatever it is you plan on making. Honestly, I don't see how the nfc device would work in relation to holding your private key and keeping it secure while also having a public key. 
An idea I think that would be cool is one of the square coins large enough to put a qr code sticker on the back as a payment address - I'm still not sure of the details of how to work out the private key though. Either that or it would also be cool if you were able to use the machine to engrave a Bitcoin address (qr code and character string) the on coins. I bet people would be willing to pay for a cool key chain that only holds the public key of a cold storage wallet.

As another option it would be neat to allow users to maintain connectivity almost indefinately but give them a certain amount of data usage until the service is interrupted.

Of course, this falls into marketing strategy.

What do you think the policy is on trading BTC for LTC or other alt-coins?  I assume that is a like kind exchange and no capital gains have to be realized at that point.  
If so, I suppose it could get complicated on determining when trading gains take place- for instance say 1/1/2012 I purchase 1 BTC for $10.  On 6/1/2012 I trade it for 90 LTC.  On 12/1/2012 I trade the 90 LTC for 2BTC.  On 1/3/2013 I cash out the 2 BTC for $200.  Do I pay long term capital gains on the entire ($200 - $10) or would some of it need to be realized as short term capital gains.

I believe you meant to say 2^256. However, and although the private keys are 256 bits, and I believe it (or your public key, and can't remember) the gets hashed into a 180 or 160 bit representation. I'm not sure of the exact numbers but I don't think they are a large as you've represented.

It doesn't seem like something a person in their 20's or early 30's could have put out as quickly as you did unless they had a lot of domain specific knowledge, aptitude and motivation.

The lost me at "at $100, 000 per bitcoin, it is worth more than all the gold" cause that would make less than $2.1 trillion where all the gold I hear is on the order of $8 trillion.   Someone check my math please cause mistakes like that shouldn't be made.

Without any mathematical rigor I'd estimate the odds at something like a 50% chance if finding a block in ten minutes such that not finding a block in 70 minutes is around 1 in 2^7.  This ain't 100 percent accurate but I imagine it gives a decent estimate. So my estimate is around 1 in 128.

My only issue with mBTC is that it is now 4 letters.  I think keeping it three letters is important so maybe we could drop a letter or use a lowercase letter in the symbol.  Something like bTC or mBT to keep it three letter.  Personally, I like the symbol bTC to represent a 1/1000 of a bitcoin but good luck with me ever getting it to gain attraction

How will this device deal with the fact that a single point of failure (the device) can lead to someone losing all their bitcoins on the wallet.  Does the device provide any redundency which a person can fall back on if the device fails to claim their bitcoins?  Not to criticize, but this is the first thought that entered my mind.  Maybe I dont understand the device fully, but such a described issue would make me shy away from using such a device.  There had to be a solution to this problem, I just dont immediately see it yet.  Regardless I like the idea that I dont have to trust all sorts of software on my computer to not sniff out my bitcoin addresses when using it.

I agree with both of you too.  I'm happy that someone seems to have worked on implementing it.  
Don't bother him though, I bet he is busy, ha.  I'm impressed by how fast he has implemented it though, that is if he started less than a week ago.

While this isn't a bad idea, I see some problems with it.  I would be hesitant about letting anyone install software on my computer for wifi which this requires.  Sharing a wifi account seems simple, but forcing the user to install mining software seems like it would be opening up a can of worms which would sooner or later be exploited and only give the idea a bad rap.  Just my opinion.  For now I think it would be best to keep things as simple as possible.   Additionally, I doubt the wifi owner would have much to gain from a few hours of GPU mining given the state of things.

Thank you for the response.  I have a slightly more complicated question if you wanna give it a shot.  What happens if the bitcoins were traded for namecoins at high and low rates through an exchance such as btc-e such that a gain was made?  Does this investment require paying capital gains?
I ask this question because it leaves the ability for every exchange to create a fictional currency (call them disney dollars) which behaves like the dollar yet is only realized upon a user's desire to withdraw the investment into his own bank account.  In such a case, a user could utilize such a vehicle to make exchanges back and forth while avoiding the need to realize capital gains until actually cashing out into a separate bank account.  I know this is getting a little creative, but it wouldn't be impossible-for instance, instead of disney dollars make the exchange for gold certificates until cashed out.
