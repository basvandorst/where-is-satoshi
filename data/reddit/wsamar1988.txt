Whoa, talk about knee-jerk! Pasta specifically claimed they want to thwart "bitcoin" - get it now? He said bitcoin, not coinbase - coinbase doesn't contorl the bitcoin network, what they pay for their fees has nothing to do with bitcoin, who their clients are? Who the fuck cares?
Why don't you re-read things and try and understand what someone says before you start even thinking!

They actually did the exact same thing to me - instead of asking to prove the funds though - which I told them it's none of their business, they asked me to take a photo of myself holding my ID and a bank statement, with the date signed. 
This is all based on me wanting to withdraw 1.5 bitcoin out of my account, that's right, and I was fully verified aswell. Never dealing with bit-stamp again.

You can sign up with Bit-pay, they offer no fees for donations. 
Saves a lot of hassles etc.
Edit: Realized it might be no fees only for US companies.

Aww, what's wrong? You never got enough credit from mummy and daddy? You wanna tell all your friends how you got "rich" off bitcoin, how you're smarter than them, me, everyone else? I'm sure you stroke your ego as much as your tiny cock.

Where are you located?
Coinjar (no spread) -  (open order book) - Australia
Kraken - Europe 
Vault of Satoshi - Canada
Coinbase - America
Or you could try localbitcoins.com for international! But it's very scammy - only use it if you are meeting in person.

I don't know why people like you think Andreas should be the P.I/Futurologist/RedditHero - he's a techy geek who loves bitcoin. I highly doubt he could've seen either of the two collapsing, let alone know of any "insider" scoop, as Andreas seems so genuine and honest - I don't think anybody would trust him with information because he will easily leak it to the public for OUR benefit! 
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:56:26
Probably because of all the KYC/AML procedures bitstamp have been enforcing to their customers..

The MtGox API code and source code were all leaked, plenty of people around this forum have linked the way the bitcoins are being seperated and split in accordance with the Mt Gox API.
Or maybe hackers are actually using the MtGox API? Maybe hackers took over MtGox and are using their system to run a legitimate business?
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:39:58
Please, tell us all how to truly live our lives and see the world for how and what it really is, all this while you troll the internet on forum boards.

Honestly, I think it's a damn shame the behavior of the people in this forum. We get it, people are using bitcoin as cannon-fodder and you groupies are angry. It's fucking sick how these pedophiles run their operations and to a certain extent, the TOR server owners NEED to have the responsibility put on their shoulders to AT LEAST help authorities find these scumbags.
Not just sit in their mums basement screaming 'FREE SPEECH' and pretending their doing something good while turning a blind eye to the wrong. I'd wonder what you would do if you found out it was your son, niece or nephew on one of these webcam shows. We would see the change in the cocky high horse sarcastic behavior change very quickly.

Hey mate - I don't think you need showtime and that's right, IQ is the set-top box which they give you. Plug an ethernet cable in there and you're good to go! There's a massive selection aswell.

I say it's a ridiculously big market and right now you have a pole position to lead, the problem you have isn't just restricted to bit-coin users, it's also browser users.. 
My question is, could you create that extension, not only for Chrome, but also.. Fire-Fox or Safari? 
If you could.. the rest is really up to how much PR you can achieve because I think It's a great idea.. People don't really have to learn what bit-coin is. What they need to know is, less or more in order:
1. How much money they will save.
2. How to buy bit-coins. (You could also add a feature during checkout to link with coin-jar or country targeted I.P addresses to link their relevant bit-coin exchange)
3. How to buy products using your extension
4. How seamless it will be for them.
Good luck because I am looking at it in a complete unbiased and outside perspective and I hope you do succeed! 
EDIT: Grammar :)

I read somewhere about a harvard woman who patented her own 3D printed makeup.. shes in talks with big businesses already. How does one go about designing objects etc? I wanted to buy one, probably will, but that has always confused me.

How do i get the privkey from by bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:33:50
From what I was reading regarding wall street exchanges, what they want to do is:
1. People don't actually buy the bitcoins themselves. 
2. Brokers act as the middle-men to purchase bitcoin/sell on your behalf.
3. They will hedge and use derivatives.
4. They will use order-books from other exchanges to stabilize a fixed price for approx. 3 times a day
I'll try get the source but I'm sure it'll be easy! :)
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:52:42
Head down to  - and sign up! They have plenty of meetups and have had meet-ups with brick-and-mortor companies in and around Melbourne.. they would more than likely love to have someone like you on-board as an Ambassador of some-sort. :)
If you would like - I can give you a contact number of one of the members running the meetups who has many contacts that could help you.

I know Sam Lee and his an extremely ginuine person with a great grasp on bitcoin and i feel sorry for him. i know his been screwed before so this is just another bad hit.

No Affiliation? Look at your history, you must be new to shilling.
1. There is also btcmarkets which don't charge GST and has a way bigger order-book than IR.
2. Independent Reserve charges currency conversion, including AUD - why would any aussie flock to their exchange?
3. Which would actually mean I would be double charged conversion rate from AUD-&gt;BTC-&gt;AUD into my bank account?
Well done Independent Reserve!

A 'Block' as in the miners who include my transaction right into it right? So you're saying they'll eventually get processed? 
Looking at it on block-chain it says Priority 'Very soon (High priority)'.. do you know how long it will roughly take? I've sent about $3k in coins and it's pretty urgent :(
I saw on some forum, someone had said this has happened to them and they asked a miner pool (Eligisum or something) to add the transaction if they paid them the fee separately. Could this work with Ghash or something if I asked them?

CoinRookie, you fail, sorry sir.
"Learn to read things before throwing your money away."
Points Australian user to use an exchange that charges conversion rates from AUD to USD than back to withdraw to bank account. NICE!
Try BTCMarkets (they don't charge GST on purchases) and allow branch and online deposits AND you don't have to be verified to buy bitcoins.

what you are seeking lies here. @_date: 2014-03-09 01:46:26
It's called Fear. People hold onto things that they most trust. Money? They will never let go of it even when they know it's the root of all their problems/stress/anxiety, why? Because people are selfish beings and the day bitcoin rises and creates a tonne of millionaires and billionaires and the majority of opinion is that of a pro bitcoin, you will see the exact opposite in these people. They want to get what's good and what's happening now, they don't give a flying fk about "structural" changes.
The only difference is, they'll behave the way they did to you but in the defense of bit-coin and they'll be bleeding in their minds thinking how stupid they are for not even investing a single penny.
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:43:14
I couldn't find a source but that is EXACTLY what I had read regarding Second-Market and NY exchange.. 
Another intersesting thing, instead of having fluctuated prices based on traders bidding higher and lower, they will base their price on a medium of different exchanges and actually have a FIXED Price for a few periods of the day (I think it was 3 times in 24 hour period).. 
You gut is strong.

None of what you are asking is fact, all the answers you receive are all assumptions.
This is what the entire Mt.Gox debacle is all over, assumptions and no facts. Welcome to the bitcoin world.
The only fact we have is, the majority of the 800k bitcoins aren't lost, weather their stolen or not remains to be seen.

You can't simply buy 1 penny worth of stock, you pay stock brokers, banker's, etc, you would be paying more than the simple stock. With bitcoin - you can buy stocks with the simple fee of the transaction.
Total value of trade exist in bitcoin, bitcoin competitors are alt-currencies including commodities and currencies of the real world.

@_date: 2015-03-27 12:19:06
Err.. really? They dont even have AUD balance, i wouldn't call them an aussie exchange.. i would say its headquarters are based in Australia. The hell would any aussies use an exchange that'll take a currency conversion cut.. on top of that,  it has low volume and pretty poor rates for trading. 
 BTCmarkets blows any aussie exchange out of the water. Poor shill attempt. Stay away from independentreserve peoples! 
Edit: Just realized your an IR shill whom I talked to before and trying to lure away innocent aussies to ur shit exchange. Deleting your post didn't help considering I quoted your user name.
