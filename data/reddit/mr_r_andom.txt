My own suspicion is that the rise from a bottom of 5896 on 6 Feb was not unconnected with the printing of 71,553,556.56 Tether EUR on 6 Feb, which you can see here:
Otherwise - I suspect - it would have been downhill from there.
If that is the cause of the recent rise from the bottom of 6 Feb then that rise doesn't show increased market confidence, it just shows the impact of that extra €71.5M hitting the market. So once the impact of that has played out, we should be back on the slide that Tether interrupted.
(Just MO, YMMV).

That means they’re now subject to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Could be interesting.

The CFTC factsheet I already linked says:








Note the words 'enforcement action'. That means prosecution for fraud. 
They would not be offering a cash reward for information about pump-and-dump schemes if those schemes were legal - there would be no point.
Still, you can believe what you like as far as I'm concerned. If linking to the government agency that enforces the law in this respect doesn't convince you, then maybe nothing will.

You're wrong to think that cryptocurrencies are exempt from the laws against financial fraud. 
Here's an example of a prosecution: 
And yes, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a branch of law enforcement. More info on them here:

Law enforcement disagrees.
