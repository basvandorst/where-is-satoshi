you are getting downvoted to hell but you are damn right
the "market can stay irrational longer than xdjawfjwfkefkfjefef" thing is very right
shorting is costly and timing is very important. for BTC, there is no way to predict the price movement. shorting it is very unwise.

that's right. and that's why the twins are jackasses. they are whales, they know they can easily manipulate the market and massacre any shorters in futures 
the only way to short bitcoin in a viable way is through option contracts but these are not available yet

now I know why Mark Zuckerburg was at war against them.
Zuckerburg is a real life asshole, but the twins seem just as bad.

it was obvious and blatant insider trading.
some people at r/btc are so blind and stupid they think insider trading like that is ok LOL
they don't care only because they probably were holding BCH already. 
what they don't know is insider trading harms small traders and only benefits the whales. 
Even without insider trading the BCH price would still be where it is now. Insider trading does not pump prices, it just pumps price IN ADVANCE. Huge difference.
