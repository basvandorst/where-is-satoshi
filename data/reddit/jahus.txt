I don't get the point. Can someone explain me?
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:20:49
Ads. Ads everywhere! My eyes are bleeding!
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:21:33
Into a nova!
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:00:33
Surely :) That would be a new great step for Bitcoin.

Perhaps he won the Pulitzer Prize, but he's under the control of the government and many other organisations. Where did he get his prize from, in your opinion?

BitCoin is going to the sun.
DogeCoin will own the dogeside of the moon while LiteCoin will own the liteside.

I'm from Algeria. How did you knew that?
Aside, I don't have problems with Israelis.

Thank you! And I now understand that having Bitcoin is a security.

Too low, too low... 10'000 BTC... too low...
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:53:56
Thanks for reminding people! Happy 6th birthday, Bitcoin!

Democracy in cryptocurrency :)
Satoshi, was this what you dreamt of?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:42:54
Meh, that doesn't prove anything.
@_date: 2015-04-27 12:50:41
Question. Why is Bitcoin core still at version [major] 0?
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:05:42
What a fantastic news. Thank you for the proposal and for making it real. Cheers!

i.e. Bitcoin is here to stay.

SEO, dude, SEO. And the link name is "bitcoin-continues-to-rise".

I am not a troll, and haven't been paid anything.
I didn't use bitcoin for months and yesterday, I wanted to buy an Amazon coupon to pay a µSD card. Basic stuff I was doing last year.
The transaction went but it's pending for more than 24 hours. My question is genuine, and if you guys don't want to answer, than okay, but it's not how I knew the community from years ago.

:/ But no reason to delete the comment, he wasn't that bad.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:50:07
So he would need to make, let's say, a transaction with Satoshi's address / priv. key?
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:57:42
Ow, it's my cake day!
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:46:42
I didn't know that Blockchain saves the IPs of the transactions!
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:28:40
And how about now? Are the proofs sufficient? Which one of proof can he provide?
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:49:03
If he wants to prove himself as Satoshi, he should make a transaction or sign a text with the private key he used for that transaction, shouldn't he?

Here's how it has been moved: 
Edit: Any chance Bter reopens soon? I lost kinda 0.11 BTC but it's really all I have and it's a lot where I live :'(
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:10:37
wow :') I really don't know what to say! I THANK YOU!
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:06:14
Hey, I'm not chasing or investigating, I was just curious to see how it has been moved :)
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:44:34
Late, sorry, I lost my Internet connection for no reason, sent in pm.
