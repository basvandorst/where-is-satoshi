From that second link...


In other words, here's a market in fees first. Then let's wait till blocks fill up and people start paying over the odds. Once those things are happening, how many miners are going to happily accept whatever higher block size scheme is imposed? None. People will bitch and squabble and fight over a dozen different proposed schemes, none will ever get consensus, and the status quo of fees will continue.

Thanks for playing. You've ignored rebit.ph's fee (1%, PHP 45). The amount received is PHP 4,471.57 = **$99.97**. 
Also the minimum fee for depositing fiat into bitfinex is $20, which seems like it would apply - unless someone is regularly sending remittances of &gt;20k$. So the total cost is **$120.10** ($20 + .1% exchange fee).
Total fees: $20.13 or about 17%.

How was it limited to discourage spammers? By limiting the maximum size of a block, thereby giving the space in a block value, thereby making transactions valuable, thereby forcing miners to select tx with higher fees over just bunging everything into the block.
If low-fee transactions are always included there would be spam. There has to be a limit on the number of transactions per block or low-fee transactions will always be included. I don't see how this is difficult to understand.

Wine provenance is not something that really affects 'the wine industry', it's only something that bothers the 0.001% involved with rich idiots speculating on and collecting 'fine wine'...

They say that even if bad owners don't out themselves, their key will become associated with poor storage... What's to stop someone using multiple different public keys?
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:42:19
It isn't obvious at all. I don't think there's going to be a hard fork; The direction the devs and the miners are wanting to go is raising fees instead (floating fees decided by free market). So if you want to be included in a block, you have to pay for it. 
On the plus side no controversial hard fork, on the minus side they might have to retract some of those WU/bitcoin comparison ads

It's because most (all?) altcoins use faster confirmation times. To argue that bitcoin's 10 minutes is too slow would logically imply that *altcoin x* is doing it better; which is a great taboo in the bitcoin space.

It's not well studied. 10 [minutes] was a number arbitrarily chosen by the Great Satoshi that has been subject of a great many tedious post-hoc justifications claiming it to be the one true optimal average time between blocks. Many altcoins work fine on a faster schedule.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:00:56
The issue is that deliberately changing the core protocol opens up a horrendous can of worms. If you increase it, how much do you increase it by? Do you follow some fixed schedule, or have it depend on the number of transactions, or some other parameter derived from the blockchain? Or just up it to 10MB, which should be sufficient for the next few years? What else do you change... There are a whole raft of desired changes on the wiki for a hard fork. Is it better to include those now, or leave them for later?
It's not a straight debate of 'which is best', either. Miners, hodlers, spenders, node operators, bitcoin companies swimming in VC cash, governments... Everyone has a vested interest in particular outcome. On top of that, there's going to be an ideological conflict between the libertarian idealists and the guys willing to trade a bit of decentralization for usability.
As yet there is no universal agreement whether a change is even required, much less when it should be or what form the increase should take... Basically, if bitcoin gets a bit more popular and this starts being an issue, prepare for drama...

A shameful 'fact' of bitcoin has always been that the network was capable of managing at most 7 transactions a second, which cannot be improved without a hard fork. 
In 2011, this was true. However with the increasing complexity of transactions (multisig, multiple inputs/outputs, etc.), it's possible to fit fewer and fewer transactions in each block. Now bitcoin can only handle 2.97 transactions a second. 
Compare e.g. VISA, which does ~2000 transactions per second on average and can handle bursts of more than 10x that at peak times.

If there was only one miner, then yes finding blocks would be a Poisson process so the times between consecutive blocks would follow an exponential distribution with parameter 1/10 (in minutes).
But that's not quite true, because of the time it takes a block to propagate and hashrate changes between difficulty adjustments...
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:11:15
Ugh, programmers rushing to simulate everything... I think it's possible to derive these results analytically ;) 
Assuming constant hashrate finding a block is indeed a poisson process, so the distribution of times between blocks follows an exponential distribution... Adding together N exponential distributions you end up with an Gamma function with shape parameter N and scale parameter related to mean block time [i.e. your dark blue line on the final graph should be the PDF of gamma(6,600)]
Allowing a steady increase/decrease in hash rate makes the above a bit more fun but it's still a tractable problem, left as an exercise to the reader

Having more than one miner makes things slightly slower and a lot more messy analytically because of the propagation time. The more miners, the longer it takes to tell everyone that the block has already been found and to work instead on a new one.
