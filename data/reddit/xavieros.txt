Wow someone that actually knows the meaning of cost averaging. Im shocked.

Found the new guy.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:51
I bought at 9.8k and bought again at 13.2. To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:37:47
This guy fucks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:33
HOLD ONNNNNNN
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:11:25
You can do a lot of things with 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:40:33
It sucks man, thanks for sharing. You'll survive. Mistakes only make you wiser and stronger; and remember, the more you learn, the more you *earn*.

This assumes full control of the BC value over a relative long period of time... you assume this is perfectly possible? Even for weeks on end?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:16
Too fast.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:40
Sound argument. Most of it anyway. Just don't pretend like you aren't greedy. We're all greedy. Greed is in human nature. Which can sometimes be a good thing; for example when it drives competition resulting in groundbreaking innovations and market capitalization. And sometimes it's a bad thing. The good thing about BC is that it doesn't care about the flaws in/of human nature; We don't need to trust another human for this system to work. That's essentially the beauty of it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:36:08
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:39:01
Aaaaaaand Coinbase is down again. Looks like your propaganda worked.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:42:59
Good point. Especially since its supply is limited. Eventually it will have to stabillize. Just like the price of the rarest of metals on earth.  Which may not have the same set-in-stone cap that BC does; but the same principle applies; otherwise they wouldn't be 'rare'  metals. And then it will still fluctuate according to its relative value to other rare commodoties depending on supply/demand.

Already prepping my 15-20k memes. Memesupporting Bitcoin is like playing a game of chess; gotta think 3-4 steps ahead if you want to be successful!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:49:26
I think you didn't get it, Capt. Obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:06:27
I'd say you're well on your way. Humility is the first step. I have a (probably even longer) road ahead of me. It's like Plato said: "To conquer oneself is the best and noblest victory..."
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:30:24


This. This. and This.

Nice jk. 20k within 10 minutes. Mark my words.

2 words: Cold Storage.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:13
If they ain't they will soon enough :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:52
Yeah lets have millions of btc sitting in non-cold storage. Who would of thought that would attract hackers? :O
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:08
Good question. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:10:15
I like your logic.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:53:46
My own reasoning for seeing this growth in Bitcoin is, because it seems to be entering mainstream with exponential growth as a result. Another reason I can think if is, because Bitcoin seems to be the main gateway and/or go-to currency to enter the alt-coin market. Then again I don't have any experience in this field and I'm just using my own common sense / logic. I wish I was more knowledgable on the topic, it is because of this that I have only invested a disposable portion of my income. 
Anyway let's assume that you're right... when would you expect BC to crash? And if what you're saying is true. That they would buy in again after the crash... do you think these post-dump buy-ins would allow BC to eventually fully recover back to current, or even higher than current pricepoints?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:33:31
Dont mind my ignorance but can I conclude out all this that Copay is still a solid wallet to use?
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:09:27
Does not remain

You know capitulation is around the corner when guys are willing to give up sex.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:22:19
There's no conclusive evidence on that whatsoever, just some causal links between the movements and printing of tether coinciding with a demand for BTC... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:26:11
This is like THE conspiracy of the moment. I will say that you seem somewhat knowledgable on the topic. Mind telling us what your background / study is? Also if you had to come up with 5 counterarguments to this theory (surely you're trying to look at this as objectively as possible, seeing as  you regard it as a potential thesis subject, so you must of thought of a few) then what would they be? 
Also, aren't you more or less assuming that all wallstreet whales / hedge funds / banks are all perfectly cooperating together in order for this to happen with maximum effectiveness and efficiency and not just be a hell of an expensive gamble?

Will do thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:10
I was too late... got an alert at 8.6k. When I got home it was back up to 10k.... gg
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:01
Can you switch back please? You know... for science (:
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:44
Yeah I wouldn't be suprised tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:17:03
I'm holding till I get rich. Either that or lose everything. Not here to make pennies.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:16
To be fair 2k in a day vs 1-2k in matter of mere minutes is something else. We're witnessing a whole new circus in the making here. No suprise Coinbase is down. 8fold traffic since their last traffic peak in June.

I bought in at 9.8k. Already feel like a star.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:42:07
That's kind of the point; no one is going to spend an infinitely appreciating asset.
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:54:42
Not sure where you're seeing $4576.52 but on my screen we're nowhere near that.

It also says something about a company that actually produces value and generates cashflow. Something crypto doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:10:19
You have a buddy that has over $352.000.000 worth of Bitcoin and he casually shared that info with you. Ok.

Aye. Getting so sick and tired of all these 'Bitcoin could..' / 'Crypto might..'- sensational headline articles that are doing nothing, but trying to generate clicks.
