That's put some of my thoughts into words very succinctly. It's why I never write anybody off as "Just an idiot and not worth listening to". Even if I think someone is wrong, it gives me a platform to iron out my own ideas from, even if it's just because of the insight on how someone else thinks.

Hate to sound like a tinfoil hatter, but in the long term, the USD exchange rate for BTC is a bad measure of bitcoin's value.

Seriously, if you're looking for something more reliable than the local fiat currency during unrest, I'd recommend using physical silver.
I support bitcoin as much as the next guy, but with all the turmoil and disorientation, the last thing you want to deal with is bitcoin security, wallet hardware, and questionable internet access.
I'm all for helping the people, and bitcoin allows anyone, anywhere, with access to the internet (and bitcoins) to support this effort without going through a "veto power middleman", which is unprecedented, but I wouldn't recommend it as a local medium of exchange.

I'd thought this too for a while, but realized the analogy was still a level removed, which could be an expensive shortsightedness.
Instead, "the internet" in this example is more aptly relative to "crypto currency", and "start ups" are the "___coins".
So it is very likely that Bitcoin will be surpassed by another "better" crypto currency (see "first mover disadvantage"), much like myspace was dethroned by facebook. But crypto currency as a whole will thrive, much like the internet did, even after the crash.
Or I could be completely wrong, there's always that option.

"Decentralized and disorganized" keeps coming up. 
I don't see merchants using the bitcoin network as a widely accepted POS payment method in the future, it just wasn't designed for this purpose.
Downvote all you like, but this is just another example of real world "first mover disadvantage".
Don't get me wrong, I'm betting crypto-currencies will eventually out-pace all the other payment methods, and they'll stand on the foundation that bitcoin laid down, but they'll be far better suited for high volumes than BTC.

Awesome car (top of my wish list) and really stoked for you. Can think of few better ways to spend BTC, but as someone who's made big purchases with coins in the past, I recommend you restock the coins you spent, if possible.
Otherwise, in a few years you'll be thinking about the 150 BTC you spent on a car, and the private island+mansion you could've gotten for 150 BTC now. This happens even if you have plenty of BTC left over.

I've read (listened) to his books and listen to his podcast regularly, and what he says about economics makes perfect sense, and he's been proven right on many points, but his negative outlook on bitcoin flies in the face of what he believes could help the current state of the economy, abolishing the government's strangle hold.
He wants a "truly free" market, devoid of most govt control, but you drop it in his lap and he starts to scoff and complain. Bitcoin may not be the perfect solution Schiff, but it's leaps and bounds ahead of anything we've seen *actually applied* so far.

This boils down to who will the gov't want to rescue, the savers, or the indebted, and given that this consumer-centric society had bred far more debt than savings, and that the gov't itself has the biggest debt of all, you can bet that fiat debasement and inflation are on the way. And if you have any living expenses, you know it's already started.
The issue now is for those with any substantial savings/capital. Your fiat holdings are slowly being watered down, and you need to an alternative store of wealth.
This is where precious metals (PMs) would usually be your safety net, and with the recent delivery failures, PM derivatives are a high risk. Your only bet is physical PM holdings, but even with the recent increase in demand, the mints are hitting full capacity, and the dealers are running into supply issues. Just imagine what will happen when the average Joe realizes his fiat savings aren't safe.
This is where *I think* bitcoin will hit its stride. Anyone with an internet connection has access to them, and you can buy as little or as much as you want/can afford. Your real problem then will be accessing your fiat, given capital controls, bank solvency, and other limits on your accounts.

Fold it once and you have 2 layers, fold it a 2nd time you have four layers, and a 3rd time you have 8 layers. So your $1 increased threefold would be $8, not just 1x3=3, that would be three *times* or a *multiple* of three.
It makes perfect sense to me, am I just losing it?

Which is why you need to listen to and consider even the naysayers' opinions. 
If you can take the general ideas of 1000 pigeonholed specialists, you start to see everything from a very macroscopic perspective, far beyond any horizon that any one of them ever could.
The key is to keep an open mind, and take note of all of their general opinions, wrong though they may seem at the time.

This is the real genius of these companies, they do BOTH.

Sorry for all the down votes bud. For what it's worth, you're absolutely right and anybody with a shred of foresight knows it. The decentralized consensus technology behind bitcoin will change so many things for the better, it's hard to fathom.
Unfortunately, this sub has been mobbed by what can only be referred to as "bitcoin newbies". The "to the moon crowd" only focused on the BTC&lt;-&gt;Fiat ratio. 
I know it can suck to have the mob flog you for thinking ahead of the pack, but this reaction is something you have to experience and embrace.

You are right, but are downvoted due to sympathy for the victim.

As the capital controls tighten, you'll find a new influx of users, not the "want" crowd, but the "need" crowd.
This is all conjecture on my part, of course, but looking at how strained the mints are to keep up with the increasing demand for physical gold and silver, once supply runs out, or is confiscated, the need for crypto currency will become painfully obvious.
Again, I could be wrong, and maybe it'll all be rainbows and lollipops. I'd actually prefer that.

This is how you spot a pump and dump.
NO RATIONAL INVESTOR would ever announce their motives to move into a market ahead of time, this would cause front running of others who drive the price up, making it more expensive once said investor actually goes to buy.
This is what you'd announce AFTER you've quietly and slowly bought into the market (as the article states they've done), and now you want to pump the price up by releasing a slew of positive headlines.
EDIT: The folks who think this announcement was made "just for the sake of it" are the same people who get fleeced. They're not doing you any favors for free, and if you think so, I wish you the best.

The problem lies somewhere between how they want the world to work (someone takes care of everything for you, and you're free to do as you please), and how the world actually works (people are greedy and if you're not paying attention they'll take everything you have).
I don't blame them for what they want, but downvoting reality won't make it so.
As a matter of fact, they could have 80% of the reality they want if they gave up trying to force the other 20, but they insist on having it all, and in time, they find they have nothing =/
To be fair, I'm still trying to let that 20% go, but bitcoin is making it a lot more manageable.

I'm glad you have so much faith in the US political system, but Bitcoin goes against everything that the FED stands for. And when the FED is threatened, no amount of "realization" or "values" is going to help you.

The real question is "when?". Looking at the general public, the market penetration of crypto currency is virtually zero, and yet it's already at $400. 
Granted, if the global economy were stable, the need for crypto currency would be trivial. But if you look at what is happening around the world right now and the state of the markets, there is a monumental void, almost perfectly fitted for crypto currency.

In terms of time, yes.


That's 6% of the current population, not impossible when faith in the fiat system is gone, and and sanctions/confiscation of precious metals comes into full swing.


Given your figure of 2 million current users, that's 0.03% of the population and assuming a target of 400 million users, which as you stated is the ballpark for a valuation of $100k/BTC. But I also think by that point bitcoins share of the market will be diluted by competing alt-coins as well.
I guess I would be inclined to agree with you, but given that the figure of "current market penetration" and "target market saturation" are both wild guesses, I can't say any of those estimates are accurate to within an order of magnitude. 
Still a fun thought experiment =)

This short sightedness is astounding once you realize how exposed an all fiat strategy actually is. As one person put it, it's the reason the rich stay rich, because they have a much broader wealth diversification, not just "10 different stocks/mutual funds", but the 3 most common were Precious Metals, Land, and Art. One is usually down, one is usually flat, and the other is up (the one you live off).
Same with BTC vs LTS, Gold vs Silver, USD vs CNY. If you're 100% invested in any one form, be prepared for a stressful roller coaster.
At the end of the day, you should have a few different financial tools in the box, and use whichever gives the best leverage for the task at hand. Stop arguing for the merits of a box of hammers over a box of spanners. Why not have both?

My sentiments really extend towards a USD default more than the Argentinian one, as that's going to be "the big one" in terms of global effect. 
Bitcoin definitely trumps PMs (and almost everything else) in terms of austerity and confiscation protection and frictionless/unhampered transferability, but as a store of wealth and an asset protection vehicle, it's just too green.
That being said, seeing how purposefully the US Gov is driving the country into the ground, I can't imagine they don't already have a plan laid out.

That's a very interesting way of putting it, and something I've been struggling to wrap my head around for a while now; If a company is making large profits, and it does so from the labor of its employees, why is it that only a select few get a share of the riches, while the rest live paycheck to paycheck with the looming possibility of losing their livelihood should the company decide to restructure or outsource.
There's plenty of wealth to go around, especially in North America, enough for everyone to be very comfortable, yet the distribution of wealth is so lopsided, on the one hand you have individuals with multiple hotel sized estates, and on the other you have people living under bridges. It seems to boil down to greed, and as long as you have that, you will never reach an equilibrium.

Now THAT is something I'd buy. I don't trust my phone with too many bitcoins because of its online nature, and I wouldn't trust a key chain that grants its holder access without requiring a password.
But if the two were used as a two piece authentication method, I could definitely get behind that.
IE, the phone requires a pin to communicate with the key chain, which signs the transaction, but only by request of your personal device. With a paper backup you keep in storage.

Gold has been the standard economic safeguard in the past, and I believe a lot of old money is still more comfortable using it, versus the less tired or true Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-09-30 15:13:07
They *would* love to regulate it, but any change in the protocol would need to be supported by the miners, otherwise you're just left with a fork nobody recognizes.

Versus USD? A lot, because in your scenario the USD is now worthless.
But you have to remember, most of the 1% are old money, and they will seek financial refuge in what they're most comfortable with, gold. 
Like it or not, gold has proven to be the most stable shelter for wealth, with a much longer and more reliable track record than bitcoin.
Now, we all know paper gold is worthless, so bullion will skyrocket.
But WTF do I know?

If anything, this video made me realize that Bitcoin is just a more convenient version of gold, and a more tamper-proof version of fiat currency.

Both. Make the one on the right full size, but for store fronts that want to keep a minimalistic look, make the left one about half to 1/3 the original diameter (*and without the text). The small ones would also attract the hobbyists and enthusiasts.

Talk about summing it up. I saw this with a few friends back in mid 2012, they were going on about "oh man, if only I'd bought bitcoin in 2011". Still didn't buy in though, now its "oh man, if only I'd bought some back in 2012, now it's too expensive".
Next year will be no different I'm afraid. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:38:07
It could, it will, and bitcoin won't care...

I believe their initial reason was that it is an "unofficial" currency and may lead to trouble for them, but had they accepted bitcoin donations when it was first suggested and not cashed them out immediately, they'd have enough to last a few decades.

They have been demonstrated to be susceptible to scamming.

Bitcoins are created by the pool if anyone. The miners then get a share. So if a miner works at a gold mine, he is not a "gold creator", the Company that runs the operation is. 
So, work for a non U.S pool.

I'm sure we've all gotten that email/letter before. I believe in bitcoin as much as anyone else here, but even I know it sounds like you're pushing snake oil when you try explain it to someone.

"Regulations", from the word "Regular", meaning to keep constant. They're the ones making sure bitcoin blocks solve at an average of one every 10 minutes.
Without them, bitcoin would be mayhem.

Their power is based on the power of the USD. Defaulting would destroy it. Ergo, they would rather debase is than declare it worthless.

Sorry, but if you took sections out of your boat to start a small fire while out at sea, calling people who jump ship "dissenters" is a little ass backwards.

Only because it's the *first* crypto currency. It's really just a "proof of concept" that has yet to reach its full potential, and there will most certainly be better ones in the decades to follow.

True, but again, only if you value mining over making a larger profit.

I'm surprised he thought enough of Bitcoin to mention it on his show at all, let alone do a whole segment. 
I get the feeling he was going to rip it a new one until he did some research and realized it had some genuine merit.
Still made for a funny bit though XD

That's funny, I actually did the math, and it has "bubble" written all over it.
Not a so much a "flash in the pan" bubble, but a "price discovery overshoot" bubble.
Still, I'm also betting that even those who buy in at the peak (I'm guessing ~$1100 BitStampUSD), if they hold through the crash, will still come out way ahead in a few years.

A crash doesn't mean a drop to zero


Anyone with any bitcoins deserves a pat on the back in my book.


The publishing of articles is exactly what some people come to r/bitcoin for.


Bitcoin doesn't care about articles, price, or community.


Bitcoin is in the "kiddie's playground" phase. Go join yacht club.

It's sad. Gold used to be a good indicator of the health of the USD, until they started trading paper gold, and now they can manipulate the price of ACTUAL physical gold.
Mark my words, if bitcoin takes off, there WILL be bitcoin derivatives, and in time, they WILL be manipulated.
Make sure you truly hold your assets (not just IOUs or online holdings) to protect them.

I've had my eye on the global markets for over a decade, and I see the utility of bitcoin. Especially considering such a limited supply, it is extremely under valued. It's day light robbery at $300, even at $1000, and the buyer is the benefactor.
Just look at what happens when the markets falter with uncertainty, investors pull their money out and where do they put it? Precious metals. Every time, without fail. But after the situation with Germany trying to repatriate their gold from the FED, it's clear that the paper gold being traded on the market is backed by reserves that have long since disappeared. So the only thing you can now count on is physical gold. 
And if you've ever dealt with physical gold, you know what a pain that is. Bitcoin fills this niche so perfectly, it's startling.
We saw China first start stockpiling gold, and now BTC, the writing is on the wall. 
With the US tripling it's monetary base, there's no where left for the dollar to go. They've squandered and abused their reserve currency advantage, and are slowly being circumvented.
It's all quite obvious, but don't expect people to listen to that doom and gloom willingly. 
As a great man once said, "Wake up and smell the ashes".

The government decree does not specify that other independent companies cannot send gold and or silver coins or bars by mail. Indeed, it is only the French public company or national post company, La Poste that is forbidden in the decree.
However, 3 months ago in March, Fedex began stopping French people from taking delivery of precious metals.
At the start of the year, UPS began stopping French people from taking delivery of precious metals.
Perhaps not coincidentally, in recent days Fedex have stopped allowing companies and individuals to send or receive gold and other precious metal bullion coins and bars by insured mail in Germany and the UK.
**This is an important story that bears watching as it appears that governments internationally, from India to France are attempting to control, restrict and make it difficult for their citizens to own bullion.**"
Could they make the impending shit storm any more obvious?

Right now, someone out there is deciding that they would rather have 1 BTC than $200 USD. They are therefore backing bitcoin.
They could be speculating, diversifying, investing, or, maybe they need to send money somewhere, and decided that sending bitcoins is more convenient than dealing with the fiat system.
As bitcoin proves its own merit in the coming years, perhaps people will decide it is worth even more...

Part of the problem is that their lending doesn't seem to be tied in any way to their reserves.
But besides that, in my experience, paypal is only used as a front end for online credit card payments. That being said, shutting down paypal is a lot simpler than shutting down Bitcoin.

The price goes up with adoption, but the momentum of demand always causes an overshoot. Then the panic from the correction just magnifies the crash. 
It's a constant struggle between "history repeats itself" and "past performance is not indicative of future results".
