I consider this to be more important than scaling - in the short term. That is, we need to implement privacy before we invite the rest of the world to start using Bitcoin.

Frequently, police departments actually get more money if the local crime rate rises. Either way, they're not going to lose their 'customers' due to shoddy work.  It's all about incentives.  
My personal experience is that getting a conviction is far more important to the investigator's reputation than uncovering the truth.
Regarding prison - I think it's generally a double crime to expect the victims to fork over even more cash to feed and house the perpetrator in a place where they can't possibly earn enough income to repay the damages they've already caused.  That's not Justice, it's revenge.

The Vault Key idea is interesting. Why do you say no one's taking it seriously?  Adding an opcode is extremely risky, which is why developers test them nearly to exhaustion before rolling them out. Accidentally add an unintended "flexibility" and you end up with the Dao hack.
The authors say they're going to make a PR and a BIP. That's the first step. A year or so of testing and maybe Vault tx's will be available.

Much worse than that. The PLA could require miners to ignore specific transactions as well as blocks found by others that contain those transactions.
Nearly every banking system in the world participates in freezing funds for political reasons, such as tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorism financing. If there are as few miners as there are banks in the world it's quite feasible that the system could be as easily censorable as the existing paradigm.
Extreme decentralization is a strong defense against this, but techniques like Confidential Transactions, CoinJoin, and ZeroCash will go a long way to making censorship impossible.

The ASIC race is effectively over. Faster hashing is now bound by Moore's Law (which itself is nearing end-of-life.)  so, in the near future mining profitability will be bounded by electrical costs, and hardware will likely remain "cutting edge" for much longer.
I see two related routes to a solution. One is simply to transform the waste heat into the primary purpose to mining - e.g. your water heater mines bitcoin to partially cover your electric bill.
Your cell phone charger could also mine as a way to load up your Brave browser, or even cover wireless charges.
Ideas like sub-chains, weak blocks, and braided DAG's might play a role in enabling orphan free, truly distributed mining for lightweight ASIC's.

I think people will prefer to use LN capable wallets that work as described at Scaling HK.
You want to purchase coffee at the coffeshop. You open a channel and decide to deposit $50 to cover your $5 coffee today, and planned purchases next week. The next person in line, Sally, does the same thing and funds a new channel for her coffee. It just so happens that Sally also has a funded channel open with a local grocery store.
You go to the grocery store. Instead of needing to open a special channel with them, your wallet will automatically find the route from you -&gt; the coffeeshop -&gt; Sally -&gt; grocery store. There is absolutely no need for centralized 'hubs,' and considering the amount of static funding that operating a hub would lock up, they are unlikely to arise.
LN capable bitcoin wallets will likely be available by the end of 2016.  If implemented properly, you won't even need to know whether your transaction, coming from your wallet and going to a specified bitcoin address, is being transmitted via LN smart contracts, or an old fashioned bitcoin transaction.

The only time any kind of mood seemed to arise was during Peter Todd's presentation and during the miners panel.  In both instances the Chinese miners are very much on the defensive.  It's obvious that they are as committed to Bitcoin as anyone and they're a bit offended that they're seen as a potential risk.
As far as the general impression of progress towards scalability, yes, I think it should be relatively easy to get something similar to BIP100, or even just a single step block increase in the next few months.  Solving scalability simply by opening up to very large blocks simply isn't going to happen before other, better solutions are likely to come online.

I believe you.
But when I started mining, f2pool was simply called 'unknown.'  It wasn't until months later, once it became the largest pool at the time, that it had a name, 'Disqus,' and the website was just a dead page in Chinese.  Wherever their hashpower was coming from it wasn't from the public.
Are you saying that you know for a fact that f2pool no longer has a financial ownership in any mining farms?

I know some of the core devs are employed by Blockstream (and Coinbase?).  The Bitcoin Foundation ran out of money.  I would expect many of them are simply working in their spare time.  They're probably all busy, and it's difficult to know who's working on what or if a desired feature is actually being worked on.  I think the lack of at least one escrowed (or multisig) location to crowdfund BIP's is an unfortunate state of affairs.
I don't know how to build such a website and I certainly wouldn't want to be trusted to hold the bounty money.  I would be willing to help get desirable features implemented that may have been put on the back-burner at the moment.

That's true, but we're entering the era of pools == mining farms.  KnCMiner is the latest to transition from creating hardware that owners could connect to any pool to simply owning a giant private mining farm itself.

I appreciate your polite interest.  Market theory is very well developed with robust and active scholarship, but the ideas it leads to remain on the 'fringe.'  I enjoy the challenge of trying to explain the portions that I think I grasp.
I'll start with your last question.  No, a functioning market does not require people to behave any differently than they do.  In fact, everything is built using chains of deductive logical reasoning *(If A, then B.  If B then C and so on.  So, if A is in fact true, and the logic is valid, then we can know for sure that C is true.)*  In the case of market economics, A is the Action Axiom - the axiomatic assumption that humans act (purposeful or *rational* action, not sweating) with an end in mind.  i.e., all action is the result of a belief (accurate or erroneous) that the chosen action will result in a state of affairs preferable (to the individuals unique preferences at that specific point in time) than the state of affairs that will result from some other action (including *doing* nothing.)  All the conclusions of Economic Theory follow from this one axiom and a handful of empirical observations (e.g. natural resources are diverse.)
The question is a valid one, in that for a market to function (really, to properly exist) it must be *free* of coercion.  So, if a firm is using slave labor or committing arson to sabotage competitors then Economics doesn't describe what's going on, and the conclusions don't apply.  So, there must be a general atmosphere of strong property rights and enforceable contract law.  Many economists / libertarians will say that this is the proper role of government.  Some argue, as I do, that these services, like any other, would be provided better by a free market rather than a single monopoly government.  (Actually, Economics has a lot to say about the results of coercion in the marketplace, such as statutory price floors, tariffs, or subsidies that distort market behaviors, so the conclusions *do* apply, they're just different conclusions.)
I'm an extremely amateur lay-economist and I'm not at all confident that I can properly lay out the deductive proof that a monopoly is impossible so let's consider the well known case of Standard Oil, which attempted to monopolize the kerosene market without any significant assistance from government.  (Rockefeller was ruthless, but he did not use violence, police, or courts to defeat his competition.)  Through dramatic cost cutting and efficiency innovations S.O. was able to control almost 80% of the world kerosene market by the early 1880's.  You could say his competitors were 'price gouging' but they were really just using more primitive refining methods and couldn't match his bulk transportation discounts so they couldn't sell as cheaply as Rockefeller could.  In fact, the &gt;90% reduction in kerosene prices Rockefeller is responsible for has been credited as a primary reason for dramatically increased literacy rates in the US in the latter half of the 19th century.  For the first time, working class families could afford to read after the sunup to sundown workday was over.
Standard Oil's market domination lasted less than a decade. By the turn of the century Rockefeller had less than 30% of the market.  His methods were copied.  At no point was he able to raise prices without giving an immediate boost to his remaining competitors.  A decade later when his empire was finally 'broken up' Standard Oil was just one of many competing companies.  It was political posturing at it's best.
Regarding patents.  Yes, the supposed purpose of patents is to reward the innovator with a temporary monopoly.  The philosophical property rights argument against this is simply that you can't own property in someone else's mind, so if you don't want them to act on your idea, then keep your idea secret.  If you follow the current issues with patent law you might be aware that it is a complete and total *clusterfuck* that inhibits and punishes innovation far more than it encourages it.  The proper way to benefit from your clever new idea is to act on it first, get the first-mover advantage, the network-effect, before anyone figures out what you're doing and imitates you. (Which will inevitably be to the consumer's advantage anyway.)
I have two bookshelves of tomes, treatises, and scholastic journals devoted to this area of ideas - and quite a list of browser bookmarks as well.  I'll try to share a few links later, if you're interested.  As I mentioned, there is a lot of serious thought, research, and mental effort invested in this area.  Modern Theoretical Economics is quite the opposite of Anonymous brand pediatric 'anarchism.'

I think it would be pointless.  Many pools are limiting their blocksize to 750KB anyway due to orphan risk.  They're not going to make larger blocks - and lose income - just because the protocol allows it.
We need to solve the network transport and orphan risk problems before worrying about the block size limit even makes sense.  IBLT and weak block subchains proposals should allow larger blocks to actually work and thus have an effect on capacity.
We need to keep the horse before the cart.

A channel is very specifically between two entities - your wallet and someone else's wallet.  If you open an asymmetrical channel with Starbucks in which you deposit $200 and Starbucks deposits nothing, then you could use that channel to pay Starbucks, or to pay *through* Starbucks to nodes at the ends of other channels Starbucks has opened *but only if Starbucks has funded their end of those channels.*  Your channel with Starbucks would not be available as part of a route to send *you* a payment because it's empty on Starbucks' end.

That's true.  I've never actually used a 'mixer' for that reason (and the requirement for trust generally.)
I've always used Shared Sends of 10 mixes each.  I know there's supposed to be some flaw in blockchain.info's implementation, but apparently sending from Coinbase to my BC wallet, Coinjoining to another address, and then Coinjoining to my destination (and the reverse on the way back to Coinbase) hasn't caused an issue with my account.  
I've moved about $50,000 through Coinbase in 2 years (most came from my bank or mining revenue) so if my Agora purchases *(of, umm, shoe repair guides . . . )* were going to be noticed and flagged, this procedure worked.

A few points.
* With segwit (which comes before LN) you can close one channel and open another with a single transaction.
* With 'push' notifications and background processes your mobile wallet can be available to update channels without your interaction.
* 0-conf txs and ultra-low fees have never been a *valid* feature of bitcoin.
The fact that a channel must be confirmed before use is a valid concern (one I hadn't considered before.)  Whether this will kill the p2p social graph version of LN remains to be seen.  I hope not.  However, worst case scenario I envision is a hub-n-spoke model with hubs the size of current credit card transaction processors, which are generally regional and highly competitive.  There are thousands of these companies in the US today.
The static capital cost of trying to run a hub is a real limitation to operating a large one.  The 'return' on your capital must be acceptable.

How so?  Are you saying that orphan risk will never limit the size of blocks that honest miners will realistically create?
I admit that the idea that dramatically increasing the network propagation rate and eliminating orphan risk will allow for much larger blocks - *is just a theory,* but what is your alternative theory?  Would making those changes somehow do the opposite and prevent larger blocks from being mined regardless of a cap increase?
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:37:32
You're not talking about symmetrical LN payment 'hubs'.  The payment processor a business would subscribe to probably won't be forwarding too many payments to other parts of the network.  They would have to put up just as much money as the businesses will be receiving in revenue in order to operate as a hub.
In other words, if you open a channel with someone and they don't match the amount you put in, then it's a one way channel.  It's a dead end only useful for them to receive payments.  That's the kind of LN node a payment processor will offer - a dead end node with which to receive customer funds on behalf of the business.
However, since opening a channel with a business using that type of service would literally lock up your funds for use with them only, they won't be as popular with customers as offering a true 2-way payment channel that allows them to use their funds throughout the network.

The Chinese miner's were really on the defensive.  It's obvious that they are as committed to Bitcoin as anyone else.

On the other hand, even if national governments banned it's use right now, it still wouldn't stop *all people* from using it.  Do you think banning copyright violation or the drug trade has eliminated those activities?

Suppose you open the channel to Starbucks while you're waiting in line, or at home before you go?  It's a lot like a gift card in that you're setting aside some of your money ahead of time that can be used at Starbucks.
Of course, the only way that a business will be involved in routing LN payments would be if they actually spend some of their bitcoin receipts, either as payment to their employees, or to purchase equipment, supplies, or services elsewhere.  Perhaps one incentive to maintain an open channel with your suppliers is so that you can route payments - for which you can earn a small fee.  Additionally, your customers will have more reason to deposit a larger amount into a channel with you if they will be able to use that channel to send payments through you elsewhere, but just having the channel would encourage them to continue shopping with you and maybe spend more than otherwise.

Maybe the example I gave the other day will work more like this:
You open a one-way channel at the coffeeshop.  Sally, the barista, has a one-way channel with the shop through which she receives her paycheck.  She also has a one-way channel at the grocery store.  So, the route is still You -&gt; Coffeeshop -&gt; Sally -&gt; Grocery store.  The only difference is that everyone only funds channels in the direction they expect to make payments.

I think people will prefer to use LN capable wallets that work as described at Scaling HK.
You want to purchase coffee at the coffeshop.  You open a channel and decide to deposit $50 to cover your $5 coffee today, and planned purchases next week.  The next person in line, Sally, does the same thing and funds a new channel for her coffee.  It just so happens that Sally also has a funded channel open with a local grocery store.
You go to the grocery store.  Instead of needing to open a special channel with them, your wallet will automatically find the route from you -&gt; the coffeeshop -&gt; Sally -&gt; grocery store.  There is absolutely no need for centralized 'hubs,' and considering the amount of static funding that operating a hub would lock up, they are unlikely to arise.

Many of the *central planning* activities of the Chinese State *have* failed.  The dramatic increase in standard of living is the main reason the population continues to tolerate (celebrate) the State.
However, banning access to certain websites is a parallel to banning transactions to certain addresses - which is why maximizing the distributed nature of the Bitcoin network is so critical.  As is developing private transaction methods like Confidential Transactions, CoinJoin, and zk-SNARK's.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:07:26
It's true that 1MB was an arbitrarily selected cap size.  However, the fact that many miners and mining pools are using a soft cap of 750KB (due to orphan risk) demonstrates that 1MB is - currently - a pretty optimum maximum size.  Changing the single maxBlockSize constant value will have little effect if larger block's are not profitable to mine.
The network transport layer needs to be optimized before raising the block size would actually offer any increase to transaction speed.  IBLT and weak block subchains (or braided DAG's) seem to be the solutions we're looking for in that regard.
That segregated witness offers modest scaling is just a positive side-effect.  (Higher use of signature heavy transactions like CoinJoin could make it more effective,) but it's critical ground-work for further developments that WILL scale the network.  It just, luckily, happens to have a similar scaling effect to BIP102.
The primary problem with all current block size BIP's (other than 100) is that they are as arbitrary as the original 1MB limit.  The purpose of a limit is to prevent an attacker from publishing a block significantly larger than the network average.  The limit should follow the average, not lead it or define it.  We don't yet have a good design for a flexible, market following, maximum block size cap.
While BIP's 102 and 2-4-8 would probably be good on their own, they could be far too much to combine with segregated witness, since segwit puts as much pressure on the orphan-risk wall as increasing the block size does.  Orphan risk has to be mitigated first (which will also mitigate centralization pressure.)
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:43:35
If you're expecting a rapid agreement to raise (or even eliminate) the max block size cap, then I'm sure you'll be disappointed.  We'll hear about the state of LN tomorrow, but I know that's not ready yet either.
It's a game theory problem.  I do expect the block size to be lifted enough to keep from running into it (kick-the-can policy) within a year but I would be shocked if Core implemented BIP101 at this point.  That said, I think the scaling problem WILL be solved - in multiple ways.
So will the centralization and fungibility problems - which are already dangerously threatening, more threatening to the real promise of Bitcoin than not being ready to invite the world to use it.  Heck, we haven't even reached version 1.0 yet.

Wow!  I hope some variation of your password will work.
 I always verify the functionality of any paperwallet before I send bitcoins to it.  I did run into an issue importing one once. (non encrypted private key from bitcoinpaperwallets)  The blockchain.info mobile wallet wouldn't import the key, and neither would Coinbase.  Eventually I went to the blockchain.info web wallet and scraped the key.  I think the problem was that I had used Shared Send to originally load the wallet and there were too many inputs or something. (I don't know, but scraping it worked.)
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:46:22
Okay, so then there would be no risk to importing a paper private key and then sending a transaction that only spent part of it.  The change would just automatically be directed to a new address in your Electrum HD wallet.  Correct?

Perhaps, if there's at least some amount of charity hashing power that uses priority rather than fees to build its blocks.
Any block limit has nothing to do with subsidizing off-chain systems.  It's merely a protective mechanism to prevent an attacker publishing a block significantly larger than the average.  I think convincingly shows that the 'average' block size is bounded by the need for maximum fee income and orphan risk.  Clearly the current average is slightly less than 1MB as many pools are still maximizing their income by setting a soft limit at 750KB.
There are some really cool ideas in the works to nearly eliminate orphan risk, which will allow for much higher actual block sizes (and the raising of the cap - preferably with a Flexcap that simply follows what the fee market and the physical network allow.)
That said, for one thing, Lightning is NOT off-chain, it's merely a way to string updateable on-chain smart-contract transactions so that very low-cost purely peer-to-peer payments can be made.
LN is not going to be the hub-n-spoke, trusted nodes model that it originally looked like.  The static capital cost of opening too many channels will make 'hub' nodes impractical.  The basic idea of LN has been fairly well laid out, the work being done now is to design efficient routing algorithms so your LN capable Bitcoin wallet will be able to get your payment to it's destination.
Have you watched the LN routing presentation on Scaling HK?  Here's the gist:
You want to buy coffee at the coffeeshop.  You decide to deposit $50 to cover your $5 purchase and your purchases for the rest of the week.  The next person in line, Sally, does the same thing - she opens and funds a payment channel.  It just so happens that Sally already has an open channel with a local grocery store.  You go to the grocery store later.  Instead of a opening special channel with them, your wallet automatically routes your payment:
You -&gt; Coffeeshop -&gt; Sally -&gt; Grocery store.

A [capitalist] market economy should be understood as a system in which we are supposed to earn our keep by doing things for other people; how much we earn depends on how others value what we do for them. The market economy forces us to be concerned about the needs of others, because it is their need that constitutes the source of our livelihood. In some sense, a market economy is a gift-exchange system; money merely tracks the value of the gifts we give one another.
The problem today is that there's too much government (slavery), not enough capitalism.

Real monopolies can't occur in a free market. There can certainly be large firms that dominate an industry but if they ever leave enough customers under served then an opening exists for competition.  In other words, entry into the market is still *free*. If competition is prohibited due to a patent *monopoly*, or an intellectual property *monopoly* (or some other monopoly by force of Law) then you clearly no longer have a *free*-market.
Historically, so-called 'monopolies' (like Standard Oil or US Steel) that did not benefit from the force of Law were never full monopolies and the height of their power was usually short lived. They were never able to benefit from the mythical *monopoly pricing* (something you *can* benefit from if you have a patent.)  They invariably benefited their customers greatly. There are inherent economies of scale for any industry using a certain production process and firms larger than the optimum size become uncompetitive.

I think democracy has been one of the worst long-term failures in social engineering in the history of the world.  This fact is much disguised by the prosperity and progress that have occurred due to economic liberty and technological progress while politics has simultaneously been dragging us down.
Society is now at its each other's throats fighting over things that we can each perfectly well decide on our own - such as who bakers should sell cake to, what to teach in science class, how much should be spent on which healthcare procedures, what age retirement savings can be used, which identification to require before hiring, how much you can undercut other laborers when seeking a job, and what standards bitcoin exchanges should be held to, among countless others.
We have a history of temporary 'kings' who have every motivation to spend and squander as much of the nation's wealth as they can trying to build a personal 'legacy' before term limits or elections deprive them of access.  This drive is much stronger than any vested interest they may have in leaving a healthier nation to their descendants.  We have a population fully invested in the idea that if they can only get enough people on their side they can force everyone else to do what they want.  Heck, anyone can be *President!*  Forcing your will on other's is now morally acceptable as long as it's done by remote through the ballot box.
The very best tool we have yet invented to solving the problems of living together on this planet is the market structure.  The free-market - *free from coercive interference, free to enter, and free to exit* - has solved most of the problems that have actually been solved in the last century.

What might be a priority is to simply '*partner*' with the mining pool operators to censor transactions that appear to be Chinese citizens attempting to evade capital controls.  If they could '*partner*' with 60% of the hashpower they could even ignore blocks containing such transactions mined by other miners - completely censoring such transactions.
With gag orders in place it would take a while for the public to notice and then to figure out what the pattern is - why some transactions aren't getting mined.

Opening a payment channel is sort of like buying a temporary, refundable gift card, *except* that you can use it 'through' someone else's gift card at a different place.
The details of the LN contracts are pretty well ironed out, the effort being devoted now is in the routing algorithm.  The LN routing presentation at Scaling HK described it thus:
You decide to open a $50 channel at the coffeeshop to cover your $5 purchase, plus your coffee for the rest of the week.  The next person in line, Sally, does the same thing - she opens and funds a channel with the coffeeshop.  However, Sally just so happens to have a channel already open with a local grocery store.

Thank you for the explanation!  I have one question - since adding the Rootstock code to your full node will actually enable you to earn a return (for running RSK scripts,) and since full nodes currently earn nothing at all, isn't it likely, if Rootstock sees relatively widespread use, that virtually all Bitcoin nodes will also be Rootstock nodes, thus providing the sidechain with the same security as Bitcoin?

Latency.  Round trip to a geostationary satellite is on average 250ms.  Getting through the Firewall takes less time than that.  It just slows down bandwidth because it's checking every packet.
There are also direct connections through the firewall that they could access with government coordination.  Not available for everyone who wants to run a node, but the miners and pool operators could likely use them.
They all seemed to agree that the firewall is a problem for running a node, but the real issue miners have is processor and disk access times when it comes to block size.

I hope there aren't too many people ripping you off right now.  Unfortunately the more people begin to use bitcoin the more likely you're going to encounter someone who's using a modified wallet that successfully double spends regularly.  (Using something like the bitundo.com API.)
You said you're selling low-value items.  RBF isn't going to make ripping you off significantly easier (it's already trivially easy,) but if no one's doing it yet, then you can hope that that will remain the case for another year or two until safe instant transactions work.

Rather than opening channels with individuals who use a bitcoin wallet on their phone, open a few channels with local shops that keep their wallets online all the time.
Your wallet will find a route to send your payment from You -&gt; Coffeeshop -&gt; {one of their customer's who's phone is on} -&gt; {that customer's grocery store} -&gt; {one of the grocery store's customer's who's phone is on} -&gt; to Gamestop. (or wherever.)

Currently double-spending wallets are custom built.  They're easy to use, have up to a 10% success rate, but you have to go looking for one.
RBF actually has to be added to wallets before it can be used as well.  Is RBF going to be added to wallets as a background, unseen feature that automatically re-sends transactions to make sure they get mined into a block, or are upgraded wallets going to include a big orange "bitUndo" button like one of the double spending wallets does now?
Some people decided to take advantage of a software 'feature', that was not only unsupported but actively discouraged.  Completely unrelated updates to the software are going to make the previously discouraged 'feature' even more dangerous to use.  Every bitcoin newbie was warned not to trust 0-conf tx.  I don't understand why folks are complaining about it now - you got to use it while it lasted, good for you.

It appears the plan is to eventually implement some type of dynamic cap that responds to the state of the network itself.  (Whether that includes miners 'paying' for an increase with difficulty, or deferred reward, I don't know, but it shouldn't be a simple 'vote' like BIP100)
My point is, that we're going to need actual data about how the network and fee market respond to reaching the limit and how they react to the limit being raised.  I had originally thought 2-4-8 would be a good way to collect this data.
I'm not sure how we can design a dynamic cap without knowing what a moving cap actually looks like in practice.
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:18:42
I think one advantage of BIP248 is that it will allow the time to develop, and more importantly, the tx fee response data to block size changes required to fully test, a dynamic block size proposal.  With SW, this alone will give us significant growth potential until dynamic blocks can be deployed.  IBLT with weak blocks will make the above scenario easier for all concerned.
LN is entirely a wallet side feature, but will play an important role in the tx fee pressure needed to decide on a the appropriate form for dynamic blocks.
Ultimately, we can use braided blockchains along with embedded mining chips to *completely* distribute - not just decentralize -  mining.  The addition of Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin (or SNARK's) could also eliminate a lot of the risk of mining centralization anyway.

Possible regulation is yet another disincentive to being a 'hub,' aside from the expense of stocking two-way channels.
The time it takes to open a confirmed channel is possibly a real concern.  I'm not sure how that will affect LN in practice.
Being a 'part' of LN - having a node - is the same thing as having a wallet and being able to send and receive bitcoin.
If the routing algorithm works I figure it will look something like this:  You open a one-way channel at Starbucks to cover your coffee purchases for the week (like a temporary, refundable, and *forwardable* gift card.)  Starbucks already has a one-way channel open with Sally, your barista, through which she receives her paycheck.  Sally also happens to have a one-way channel with a local grocery store.
So, you go to the grocery store, and your payment goes from You -&gt; Starbucks -&gt; Sally -&gt; Grocery store.

I really don't think bitcoin's ready to be widely used yet.  I think most of the current value really is in it's expected future value - hodler's and traders.  That said, I expect we'll see enough of a block size increase to avoid running up against a hard cap for the first time in Bitcoin's history fairly soon - if for no other reason than that nearly everyone thinks we need to and there's actually a competing version (XT) making threatening throat noises.

It separates the addresses and tx amounts from the signatures that reference those transactions. This allows more transactions to fit in the same block space, up to 4x more. The signatures still have to be broadcast and verified of course, so it doesn't reduce the bandwidth much if at all.
e.g., we could broadcast and verify 4MB of transactions and then fit the tx (minus the signatures) in the existing 1MB blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 03:01:17
I think the best solution would be something relied on actual statistics rather than voting.  There's no real reason to think that the masses would somehow know what the appropriate max size should be.  I think democracy is a terrible way to make decisions in general and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
The automatic adjustments in mining difficulty work well to keep block times at an avg of 10 minutes.  I'm sure the block size cap could be automatically adjusted to maintain some proportion of full blocks to not full blocks on average.  Or an overall average of percentage of blockspace filled.
@_date: 2015-12-24 08:21:01

QC might make it easier to find a hash collision, but you would still need to find the *correct* collision. A hash does not contain all the original data. Depending on the amount of data, most of it is irretrievably lost.
Consider the very last check digit on your credit card number. It is the result of a simple hash of the rest of the number. You can't reverse this single digit (0-9) and reveal the whole credit card number. You can reverse '5' into countless valid original numbers but it's unlikely you could accidentally discover an actual credit card number this way.

You're viewing Lightning as it was originally envisioned.  It's no longer expected to work that way.  There will be no 'channel providers' or 'hubs.'  Everyone will be a channel provider.  LN will be much closer to the pure peer2peer system that Bitcoin was in the early days than it is now.

I don't think they'll be any easier than hiding income.  A manufacturer / retailer (someone who sells what they make) could pull it off, although doing it piecemeal would be tricky - it would make more sense to just operate entirely on the black market.
For typical retail transactions though, selling 'under the table' would require forging or modifying sales receipts for the entire supply chain.  If Acme records how many widgets are delivered to Warehouse Inc, which records it's own sales to Mom'n'Pop LLC, then Mom and Pop are going to have a hard time disguising the fact that they've sold half their inventory without collecting the tax.

important to mention that the Bitcoin miners (via merge mining) are going to be the ones
running these contracts and benefiting from the vast majority of the fuel consumed to run
those contracts.

I don't see any necessary relationship between channel sizes and fees.  It should be cheaper to transact directly with Starbucks than through an intermediary.  Starbucks probably wouldn't charge you anything to open and update a channel with them, only charging you when you want to route through them to someone else.
However, a lot of that we just don't know yet.  Since it's become apparent that centralized hubs aren't likely to form or last very long, developing an efficient routing algorithm has become the next step before rolling out LN capability in wallets.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:36:32

An LN node is unrelated to a Bitcoin node.  Any wallet that opens channels is a 'node.'  However, with push notifications and background processes mobile wallets can be available to update channels without user interaction.  Sure, sometimes they'll be offline but I doubt that will be an issue.

The author presents a framework outline for solving the centralization and free-rider problems inherent in the current protocol.  AFAIKT, the proposed use of micropayment channels to facilitate price discovery for network services (checking an address' inputs, verifying or running scripts, relaying a block, submitting transactions to a miner, etc.) doesn't require any consensus changes.

Many businesses like to lock up some of their customer's funds in gift cards.  An LN channel would be a lot like a temporary refundable gift card, except that you would be able to use it other places (perhaps for a small routing fee when you're not directly purchasing from the company you opened the channel with.)
@_date: 2015-12-06 14:28:22
The danger that I think is far more likely starts with a form letter from the Chinese version of the IRS to the CEO of a mining pool, followed up with some personal interviews informing them that any transactions that appear to be Chinese citizens attempting to send money out of the country be refused, and that any blocks mined by other miners that include such transactions be ignored.
The US IRS could try the same thing with tax evaders, although currently only China could pull off ignoring other's mined blocks, so the success would be unlikely.
*Every* government might cooperate trying to enforce similar rules to prevent terrorists from using bitcoin.  With gag orders in place, it would take some time to realize that certain transactions aren't being mined (except for the individual senders/receivers) and might be even harder to figure out what the pattern is. (Why they're being censored.)
Massive decentralization is one solution to this, but I think just as important is implementing true fungibility using Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin.  These would actually protect miners from the threat - no one can force them to censor transactions that can't be differentiated from any other transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-22 04:30:18
Here's the relevant presentation from Scaling HK:
It's the very cost of opening too many channels that will prevent 'hub' nodes from forming.  One of the current main efforts of LN developers is to design an efficient routing algorithm so that the system begins in a highly distributed manner rather than naturally 'reducing' to a distributed manner later.
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:42:18
Okay, yeah I'm wrong about that.  The other pools would keep trying to repeatedly add the banned transactions, thus making "invalid" blocks. (from the Chinese legal perspective.)
Still, it's just that type of censorship that decentralization is supposed to prevent and having pool operators susceptible to State force is a potentially crippling weakness.  If all 9 of those on the panel were approached by their respective governments in a coordinated effort to deprive ISIS of bitcoin, then it wouldn't be so readily apparent.  And it's just a slippery slope from there . . . 
I see two options, preferably we can do both:
* 21 (&amp; Intel, AMD, etc.) put mining chips in our toasters using something like p2pool.
* Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin immunize pool operators from the ability to censor.

I'm watching it a bit time-delayed (streaming sucked,) but I think the guy that spoke after Peter Todd made a good point that some sort of moderate action is advisable simply to avoid the XT schism.

In no sense is State regulation necessary or even desirable, in an absolute sense. What it is is inevitable. In the current climate, regulations that add some certainty to operating your business legally ARE desirable. The positive potential of some legal clarity through regulation cannot be understated. The real promise of Bitcoin will only be realized with widespread use.
It must be understood that it's the interface between Bitcoin and State currencies that's at stake here. The fundamental nature of Bitcoin and the real promise of bitcoin are immune to State interference.
Whatever types of insured wallets or bitcoin banking systems arise in the future, the ability to use the blockchain itself will preserve those aspects anarchists value so highly. 
- A 'sound' currency.
- Funds immune to seizure.
- Financial privacy.
The 'sound' money feature is the most important from a liberty perspective. The other cases require some effort and acceptance of risk (losing your pvt keys) but no State effort will remove them.
Again, any regulations that at least 'allow' an interface between Bitcoin and State currencies can only be a positive development.

"Enough fees to make up for the block reward" means there has to be a backlog. There has to be enough fees available for the next block that didn't fit in this block *at the very instant this block is found.*
A backlog is nothing to fear. High priority- settle in an hour, regular priority- settle today, low priority- settle just as fast as an old fashioned bank deposit (within a week.)  For everything else there's instant LN or atomic SC swaps. 
*Everyone* agrees that we will eventually have to increase the block size above the current 2MB SegWit size to prevent the backlog from getting *too big.*  (IMO more than a week's worth is too big, but that's up to the market.)
There actually used to be a lot of zero fee transactions - but In any case, a fear that there will be no fees at all isn't the problem. 
The critical period will be between 2020 and 2032 when the reward halvings have a real potential to completely wipe out mining.   A competitive fee market will be necessary, but there's a possibility we'll need to smooth out the reward decreases in order to completely prevent the problem.

SegWit's blockweightlimit isn't completely arbitrary. The weighting is based on computational load - validating signatures is ~4x more expensive than validating inputs.
There is no objective metric to measure capacity. Ideally, the block size limit would be some multiple of mempool size; small enough to keep several blocks ready to mine but large enough to prevent a week deep mempool. **But**, there is no "mempool", every node has its own mempool. Besides, this could still lead to blocks too large, making initial node startup difficult and/or centralize mining. 
Bitcoin Unlimited tries to solve this, but fails completely. It gives miners complete control over the block size limit. That's like giving coal plants control over pollution limits. 
There is currently *no satisfactory* dynamic block size proposal that will work for a cryptocurrency without a continuous tail-emission reward schedule. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:27:54
It's simple. Money is only money if other people will take it as payment.  If a merchant accepts *any* cryptocurrency, they accept bitcoin. Very few accept any alt-coins. 
As far as technical improvements, there's the approach of Dash &amp; NextCoin which include extra features like markets or classifieds in the core protocol.  (I think this is a mistake. The currency software should follow "Keep It Simple Stupid,")
Then there's Monero, the only cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin that you're likely to find merchant acceptance. It's a different design (not a software fork) and has strong privacy features that actually stand out.

The bitcoin seller will cover the miner fee. It's about 10 - 50 cents regardless of amount sent. LBC will charge a percentage fee for setting up the sale, and the seller will charge whatever price per bitcoin you're willing to pay. 
An AU$10,000 cash transaction is significant. If I were you, I'd make a couple of $100 purchases first to get the hang of it.  For the large purchase, you'll want the seller to hang with you for an hour (after you give the cash) to make sure you have several confirmations on your bitcoin.

If the mempool is nearly empty (because a block was just mined) there would be no incentive to burn electricity for an empty block with almost no reward. Hash power would stutter, turning on only when enough fees show up.

I don't think anything's really changed except that while it was originally expected to work as a hub/spoke model that now appears unlikely - so a ripple style routing algorithm will need to be developed before it can be rolled out.
It's possible that LN fees users have to pay will be balanced by the fees they receive.  As long as your wallet has at least two different channels open (one incoming and one outgoing,) it will provide a potential route option for other users.

Yea, LN is intended to be a capability added to your wallet. A 'hub' is just a wallet with lots of open channels. Whether hubs will be necessary depends on whether a p2p routing algorithm - similar to a mesh network - is feasible. Regardless, you can always open a one time channel to make a single instantly confirmed payment but it will require two transactions (and two fees) to do so.

@_date: 2017-03-02 16:18:36
Sure, the 'accusation' has merit. 
Satoshi originally added the 1MB limit as a DoS prevention measure. It prevents a malicious miner from carrying out certain types of attacks.  He chose to make it permanent instead of temporary, and while he mentioned in passing that it could be raised in the future, he never bothered to do so prior to leaving.
The original reason is still valid - a limit on miners that miners can't change. New research has revealed that a blockchain without a block reward (like future Bitcoin) will become unstable if blocks are large enough to include all available transactions (empty the mempool,) so in addition to DoS prevention, a block size limit is needed to stabilize mining.
Once miners activate the current 2MB (SegWit) size increase, fees should reduce somewhat, but cheap, fast p2p payments for more than a few thousand people will require layers on top of the blockchain.

What are you expecting to see?  Just like any market, the mempool is an order book, and the miners sell into the order book from highest to lowest fees until they fill a block.  Sometimes variance reaches low fee transactions in the order book (mempool) and clears them. 
There will always be x fee that gets in next block, and some min x that statistically will be the cheapest fee that gets in before being dropped by most mempools.

Yes, you're correct. The channel is not actually open and trustworthy until the initial 'open' transaction is confirmed. After that, a signed update pushed to the channel will be instantly trustworthy. To open and close a channel for a single payment would be pointless.

Yes, as long as a channel is in active use then the fees earned might be worth the capital tied up.  Every wallet with 2 or more open channels will function as an intermediate node and according to social graph theory you should be able to make a connection to almost anyone in less than 6 hops.  An LN 'node' is nothing like a full bitcoin node.  It's merely the ability to validate and broadcast a new transaction type to the network.  With push notifications and background processes any wallet that can make and receive LN payments is also an intermediate node - even mobile SPV wallets.
The big problem with trying to operate a hub / spoke model is that the hubs would have to open 2 way channels (which tie up capital that may not even move.)  The new p2p model would be a lot easier to implement and could operate with 1 way channels.
i.e., --  A 1-way channel from you to your favorite coffee shop.  A 1-way channel from the coffee shop to an employee.  A 1-way channel from that employee to a grocery store.  That gives you a two hop connection to the grocery store and the only capital tied up is capital that is actually expected to be spent in that direction.

Difficult to define spam. Maybe if the value sent is less than the fee to send it, but even then the sender thought it was worth the expense.

One possible metric is the average mempool size. If the mempool grows without limit then the blocksize is too small. If a string of lucky blocks can completely empty the mempool then the size is too large.
Unfortunately, there is no single mempool to measure. Additionally this metric ignores any effect the blocksize has on node costs.

A good wallet will do that for you - including calculating the current going rate for next-block confirmation. There are several good wallets to choose from. Hopefully soon some will include RBF capability so they can attempt a low fee to start and only increase it if necessary.
However, to answer your question, the size of a basic transaction depends on the number of inputs. If you're sending money from one address, it's going to be pretty small. If you're payment is pulling small amounts from a bunch of separate addresses, then it can be fairly large.

I think that lack of fungibility is Bitcoin's biggest problem right now, but I would answer your question with options 2. Bitcoin has a killer app. Denationalized sound currency. If bitcoin is not significantly popular in 10 years it might simply be because the central bank scheme hasn't yet collapsed.  If bitcoin goes to zero the most likely culprit will be quantum computers.

I don't think that's exactly the best thing for bitcoin, although saving more than you spend (or at least saving *something*) is smart behavior for an individual and a society.
The amount of bitcoin being kept as savings isn't hurting Bitcoin. There's still plenty of commerce. Most alt-coins have zero commerce. Literally zero, unless you consider speculative trading as commerce.

The problem with opening too many payment channels is that you end up tying up a large amount of capital.  For this reason it's expected that if the network starts up with a few large hubs, those hubs will quickly shrink and the system will become a more distributed p2p network  anyway.  That's why the current development efforts are to start it up with effective routing algorithms in the first place.
The concern expressed with the earlier view of LN was that only rich companies would be able to afford to run a central node.  Of course, rich people aren't stupid - they won't be wasting their capital maintaining a large node, so now we need to figure out how to route payments efficiently through small nodes.
It's possible that any fees you have to pay to route your LN payments will be balanced by the fees you earn when others' payments are routed through your wallet.

As long as tx malleability is fixed (SegWit) you can upload your latest pre-signed channel closing transaction to one or more third-parties to broadcast for you, in the event the other party tries to close the channel with an old channel state.

That might work. It will probably need a 2 - 3 year lead time before activation just to be certain there are no incompatible nodes still running.
Right now there are still 0.7 nodes running on the network, so a safe HF that doesn't fuck over anyone will take some time.

It's the same thing as a hard fork. There'd be the new nodes with the miners that followed them, and old nodes with old miners.
What it does, is require the exchanges and payment processors to declare ahead of time which fork they will support. If they all acted together, they *might* force the miners to follow, but even one major exchange willing to recognize the old chain and we would risk a chain split.
It's just another name for a HF (*all* nodes and *all* miners *must* fork,) with the same risks, no easy way to count "votes," and requiring a lead time of at least a year.

The *blockmaxweight* value would theoretically allow 4MB blocks, but such blocks would be artificial and unlikely. It's expected SegWit will transmit and store 2MB blocks - containing 2MB of transactions.    They will look like 1MB blocks to any pre-SegWit node. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:55:44
Introducing the cap didn't require a HF.
The purpose was - and still is - a defensive measure to prevent a malicious miner from attacking the network.  *The blocksize cap protects us from miners.*
Over 100 developers have been working for several years so we can safely raise the cap a little (first doubling it with SegWit) without risking the whole system.

I'm not sure what type of attack you're considering. A 51% attack can allow the attacker to undo (reverse) *one of their own recent payments*. It doesn't have the ability to steal or destroy other people's money. 
However, there is a critical period between 2020 and 2032 where the reward halvings could potentially have disastrous consequences. Simply put, most miners stop mining, block times and difficulty adjustments take months, and it all just grinds to a halt unless transaction fees increase rapidly to cover the shortfall.

Smaller pools are more sensitive to orphan risk. (If you usually find only one block a week, losing a block would be a hard hit.)  A *very* small number of large miners could put all the other miners out of business. **Especially if the majority miners have control of the blocksize limit.**
Of course, orphan risk can be easily minimized by merging with a larger pool or having everyone use the same block construction node, which is another route to centralization. 
The effect of larger blocks on *users* nodes is another issue entirely - which is why users nodes set the limit. We're all pretty confident that 2-4MB of data per block (what SegWit will permit) is safely acceptable at this time.

The attack is public - everyone will know which miner is attacking. I think it would be a serious inconvenience, but not a disaster. For a land title you could easily wait a day or two (100 blocks or more) before considering it "confirmed", then even a very high hash rate attack would have a minuscule chance of removing it.

The only full node that matters is *yours*. Running a node is the only way you can be certain you've been paid with valid, spendable bitcoin.

SegWit will "lock-in" after 95% of the blocks in a single 2016 block difficulty retarget period (two weeks,) include a signal that the miner is ready to enforce the new rules. Two weeks after lock-in, SegWit will be activated and enforced.

@_date: 2017-03-01 14:01:55
Yes, the numbers assume SegWit is actually used. Multisig transactions "compress" better than regular transactions. At the time SegWit was proposed, the actual mix of tx types would have resulted in ~1.7MB blocks. Now, it would be 2MB. (4MB would be artificial - unlikely to occur.)
As far as percentage of SegWit transactions, almost every commonly popular wallet (and *all* hardware wallets) are either ready or planning to release SegWit software.  
There's very good reasons Bitcoin node software doesn't auto-update, but most wallets do (especially phone wallets.)  I expect most users would be broadcasting SegWit transactions within a couple months of activation - just because their wallet said "update available; might lower fees."

@_date: 2016-01-06 04:16:43
Lightning network's design doesn't include hubs.  It's a p2p (wallet to wallet) layer of smart contract transactions that settle on the blockchain.  Just publishing an LN transaction - either opening/closing a channel or just making a payment - will be pretty simple to add to a wallet.  The routing algorithm that finds a route from your node (SPV/LN wallet,) through other people's nodes, to your intended destination, is the tricky part.
Maybe a wallet provider can distinguish their product with a superior routing algorithm but it's more likely that whatever is developed will be used by everyone.

That's a good definition - but recall that as originally designed a full node and a miner (CPU) were one and the same. The development of ASIC's, and particularly pooled mining, are out of scope and Bitcoin barely survives as a decentralized system in spite of them. 
If an *average* home computer, on an *average* residential bandwidth connection, in a developed area is *NOT* capable of running a full node, then Bitcoin *cannot* be decentralized. 
There have been many significant upgrades to the Core software (compact blocks, libsec256k1, pruning, bandwidth target, etc.) which make it much easier to do the above. 
Now, having ten individuals (pool operators) choosing which transactions should be confirmed in 95% of blocks is a serious concern. The *decentralized* node network can prevent them from breaking the rules, but we can merely *hope* they don't censor our transactions.

Not exactly. The ECDSA will need to be replaced with a quantum safe public key algorithm. 
However, the hashing functions are not vulnerable to QC. Except for some of the earliest versions, bitcoin addresses are a hash of the public key. The public key is only revealed when the coins residing in the address are spent. So, as long as addresses are never reused, then the coins are safe even in the face of QC.

There's a.bus. Everyone is bringing there luggage into the bus and clogging all the seats. A SegWit bus has a luggage bin underneath. If some people put their luggage in the bin it leaves more room in the bus for people, even those still desperately clutching their luggage. 
In other words, it's a nifty trick that fits 2MB blocks on the blockchain without the risk of a hard fork - Bitcoin will still work for those who don't upgrade, and they still benefit from the larger blocks. 
SegWit was a 'duh' moment. It should have been like this from the start, but Satoshi didn't think of it.  From a computation standpoint, signatures should be counted separately from other parts of a transaction (about 1:4) and they shouldn't affect the transaction ID.  So segregating them is a no-brainer, plus it doubles the number of transactions per block, which is a nice bonus.

The current median proportion of multisig transactions will result in an effective doubling of the blocksize. When it was first announced the estimate was 1.7. It's now 2

SegWit doesn't change the storage of witness data. If you run a pruned node, your node discards *all* old transaction data.

Everyone wants an adaptive block size solution. No one has yet come up with anything satisfactory. 
An ideal solution would prevent the unconfirmed mempool from growing too large, while also preventing miners from emptying the mempool. (Have an average of perhaps one days worth of transactions waiting for confirmation.  Pay a high fee, get confirmed quickly, average fee, confirmed within a day, low fee, same as a bank 3-5 days.)  Unfortunately there's no clear way to achieve this.

@_date: 2017-01-18 13:10:40
You have the right idea using the Electrum wallet in TailsOS to receive your revenue. 
After that, use one service (like shapeshift or Poloniex) to convert your bitcoin to monero, (into your own Monero wallet) and then different service to convert back to bitcoin. 
Then sell your bitcoin for fiat on any exchange. You could also skip the last step and just sell the monero for AUS$. 
It's very difficult to make the last step anonymous, if that's necessary. Localbitcoins for paper cash is probably your best bet. 
Essentially, with some care you can operate anonymously within Bitcoin, but once you try to convert to $ you will lose any real guarantee of privacy.  The above process will break any connection between the bitcoin you earned and the bitcoin you cash out - but if you need to explain where your bitcoin came from . . . well, then you need a traditional banker who launders money.

The fees go up and down. We expect them to be much lower in the near future with the recent and ongoing upgrades to the system.  It's true that the system currently isn't very good for payments, but since most users are investing for the long term, fees aren't that important. 
Keeping your bitcoin on Coinbase isn't necessarily *bad.*  It's a US bank run by professionals and your deposits are insured. The trade off is between you possibly losing your money trying to "be your own bank," or Coinbase losing your money to thieves (unlikely,) or seizing your money due to a court order. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:38:06
I'm extremely skeptical of most coins out there. Bitcoin is the safest bet (although not "*safe*) for long term. Litecoin is a good real-money testnet for bitcoin, so will probably stick around. Monero offers excellent privacy tech, so it may have a strong use-case as well.

The consensus layer wasn't designed to be changed, ever. Thus, the controversy over the last 2 years.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if it hit 750 again in the next month or two. 
Consider the price you expect it to eventually reach before you spend (or sell) the bitcoin. Will potentially missing out on a couple hundred profit per coin be much of a difference?
Either way, you need a plan and to stick to it. Invest it all now, and then be able to resist cashing out if it hits $500 before it really goes up, or commit to regular purchases.  
Knowing *why* you've made an investment decision and then sticking to the rules you've set for yourself is the trick to doing it right.

Antminer's don't have ASICBoost enabled by default. The capability is there, so it's likely Bitmain themselves, and perhaps select customers are using it, but most miners aren't enjoying the benefit.
SegWit *completely* prevents the *covert* version of ASICBoost, however, SegWit isn't actually activated yet. It should lock-in on Aug 8th, and the first SegWit blocks will be mined towards the end of the month.

There's no effective way for anyone to *enforce* it on the Bitcoin network. It might be pretty easy to enforce it on bcash though.

There's no official "standard" but generally, 'Bitcoin' with a capital 'B' refers to the system, while 'bitcoin' refers to the currency token the platform operates.

If you really haven't heard - the Bitcoin blockchain was copied on Aug 1st and split off to make a new coin most people are calling BCash (BCH)
If you have the private key to some bitcoin, the same key can now spend the copied bcash also - if you install a special bcash wallet.
If you try to do that, be careful. Some people are getting things mixed up and risking losing money. 
Basically, it's a giant double-spend of the entire blockchain.

2X'ing SegWit actually results in 4+ MB blocks.
A hard fork, especially a contentious hard fork, is too dangerous for such a trivial change that isn't going to provide any tangible user benefits.

Every single LN wallet will be competing to get fees. The cost to have a wallet is close to nothing, so fees will be close to nothing.
To operate a 'hub' simply means you have a whole lot of bitcoin sitting in your wallet. In a *HOT* wallet where it could get stolen, all to earn minuscule fees
I kind of doubt we'll see very many hubs compared to the number of user wallets, so your LN transactions will be more likely to connect through several other small wallets than one or two fat wallets. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:14:52
Yes. The difference is that the Aug 1st fork, the bcash folks added replay protection, so it turned out to be okay. The 2x folks are refusing to do so, so it'll be extra important to wait until it's definitely safe.

There's very close to zero chance that it won't lock in. Miners are already enforcing BIP 91 which rejects any block not signaling for SegWit. In other words, 100% of blocks are signaling for SegWit, it only needs 95%, so we can expect it to lock in next week and activate two weeks later.

We obviously can't *all* have pruned nodes, but Bitcoin literally could be rebuilt (after EMP or something) from a single full copy of the blockchain. 
A pruned node doesn't feed historical blocks to brand new nodes, but they do everything else - validate every transaction and block and forward them to connected peers as well as serve data to SPV wallets. 
Pruning is really for saving disk space. Using maxuploadtarget instead will still feed old blocks to new nodes, just not so many.

The advantage of Bitcoin as a currency is that the code you run defines what happens. We need to know exactly what will happen before accepting a change to the code.
We do know that if *everyone* goes along a HF will work. (Whether the change made will work is a different question.). Do you see everyone going along?

Yes, a hardware wallet for hot use, or a properly created (and stored) paper wallet are the *most* secure options. 
Of course a full node has other advantages (independent control, privacy, etc.)  A carefully compiled and maintained Linux system running a Bitcoin node should be pretty secure.

Bitpay's Bitcore version has the Wallet Services extension which works with Co-Pay on mobile and the DigitalBitBox hardware wallet.

The number of skilled developers who support SegWit (almost ALL of them) is a good metric. So is the number of wallets and exchange services (most of them.)

A QC wouldn't be able to steal coins from a modern address which has never been spent from.
Satoshi's coins were actually sent to the public key, not an address (hash of the public key.)

Yes, it will reduce demand for blockspace *per user*. Are you sure we won't have more users in the future?
If transaction demand doesn't grow, perhaps no one will bother to use LN even if it's available - so nothing would actually change. If demand fails to grow with larger blocks, total miner income will certainly decrease.

SegWit is much more than a block size increase. It not only sets the max block *weight* to 4MB, it's also an upgrade to the data structure that the blockchain is stored in, solving a very old malleability bug.
Recent research has concluded that trying to use much larger blocks to serve SPV wallets would require node operators to have million dollar RAID arrays just to handle the required throughput.

The problem with most regular exchanges is that you have to use an expensive wire transfer to fund your account.  Any CC or debit card purchase will have a &gt; 2.5% surcharge.
If your bank is part of the clearXchange network you can use bitsquare, but the prices tend to be high and there are limited offers to choose from.
Coinbase (1.49%) and Uphold (0.49%) can do free ACH straight from your checking account. Check Kraken, Gemini, and ItBit - they have US bank relationships, so they might do ACH as well. 
Bitwage (an Uphold partner) can take your direct deposit paycheck and deliver bitcoin. 
I don't think 1.5% is that bad. The bitcoin price changes that much in a day. If you're buying to hold it'll make little difference in the long run.
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:57:07

They will try to cram as many transactions into a block as they can, including leaving no available transactions for the next block if possible. That would cause the hashrate to oscillate wildly, but it won't happen as long as we limit the max block size to less than 1/2 the minimum mempool size.

If it takes 6 hours to validate a block - and new blocks keep arriving every 10 minutes - your node won't work.   A small but evil miner might only find one once a day, but if such a block is considered valid it will fuck up bitcoin for everyone everyday. If it is *possible* to attack Bitcoin, it *will be* attacked.

Active mining nodes make up less than 2% of the ~5000 peer nodes in the network. Miners are supposed to build a blockchain that the network will accept, not spit out whatever they want and expect users to swallow. If it were really up to miners they would have gotten together years ago to give themselves ₿1000 block rewards.
What's great about a soft fork like SegWit is that miners actually can choose to make a change (because some users want it) and it's NOT forced on users who think it's useless or dangerous.

The thing is, there are no existing Bitcoin development projects that intend to keep the 1MB limit. There are really only two, Core and BU, which both intend to increase that limit.
The problem with BU's version of a flex limit is that it gives the power to the miners - who are the targets of the limit. It's like letting coal plants decide what their emission limits should be. It's back-asswards.

@_date: 2016-11-18 20:37:32
Actually, I think there's a potential risk that some miners *would* increase the blocksize dangerously.
If a number of pools in close geographic proximity (or behind a Great Firewall) could double the blocksize, they could cut fees in half while still earning the same revenue. Smaller miners, or those who otherwise can't successfully propagate double sized blocks through the firewall would see their fee revenue cut in half - likely driving them out of business. This is a smart business move for large pools to make. Whoever can make the biggest blocks can take over the mining industry.  i.e. - severe centralization.

The multiplier is based on the externalized cost of processing transactions placed on nodes and determined by the size of witness data relative to the rest of the transaction data. 
Only very artificial transactions would fill up a 4MB SegWit block. Real world usage right now will be 2MB blocks and could get a bit larger with more multi-sig use. There's no reason to ever change the multiplier.
Max_block_*weight* is used in a lot of different calculations now, but max_block_*size* is still there. Maybe it will be raised in the future (or replaced with a dynamic size algorithm) but newly developed and upcoming tech might make that unnecessary. Which is good, because it's starting to look like it's too late (Bitcoin is too big and too diverse) to easily pull off a hard fork safely.

The remaining miners would start making more money, attracting some of the electricity back.  Just like any other part of the economy, a see-saw balance. 
As long as users value the network (are actually paying transaction fees,) then they'll get as much security as they're willing to pay for. 
If the scenario you're picturing happened very quickly, then yes, the network would slow down (just like bcash' did.)  That would indicate that something was seriously wrong with Bitcoin, but one way to "save" it would be to manually HF a rapid difficulty adjustment, exactly like bcash.

Honestly, that sounds like a mess. In any case, a faster block time is probably better than a larger block at this point. I think the main reason SegWit includes an *effective* increase was simply to satisfy the significant demand and support for 2MB from the miners.

I think Coinbase fee is acceptable for the ease of use and free ACH transfers.  Most regular exchanges require expensive wire transfers which only make sense if you're buying a couple thousand dollars worth.
With Coinbase wallet service you can buy up to your limit *at the current price* (plus the fee.)  On GDAX, Bitstamp, etc, buying that much at once will dig into the order book, maybe even enough to equal the 1.49% fee. (Or with a limit order, remain unfilled.)

Simply transferring your bitcoin from Coinbase to another wallet you control is recorded as a 'sale' by Coinbase for tax purposes. Doing this immediately after purchasing should eliminate any tax due.
Your coins won't be anonymous - but the IRS would have to do blockchain analysis to present evidence that they're yours, *and* that you still have access.
So, to go further, simply use shapeshift or Poloniex to buy some Monero, withdraw to a Monero wallet, and then use a different anonymous service to convert back to bitcoin, in yet another wallet. 
Or, wait a couple months to use a TumbleBit mixer.

It doesn't matter where you store the keys, if there's a fork you'll end up with double the coins across both chains.

@_date: 2017-08-22 16:03:37
Can be tricky to explain clearly.
There's a two part transaction. One opens a payment channel with a chosen amount of bitcoin. Using the LN network, you send signed messages back and forth which move the coins from one end to the other. Finally, you put the close transaction on the blockchain.
What makes it so powerful is that payment channels can be dynamically chained together - your payment will move through other people's wallets on its way to your destination.

They might have made some other changes since then but there's no indication on their website. They certainly haven't bothered to merge any BIP's since, not even the SegWit updates.

A "hosted" node? No thanks. I don't want to trust a third party.

@_date: 2016-11-29 00:45:51
It gives large miners an unfair advantage over small miners. It gives miners the ability to knock regular users off the network so everyone is forced to use trusted third parties who can afford to run full nodes.
I don't know what the limit should be, but it certainly shouldn't be up to miners. The entire purpose of the limit is to limit the miners.

@_date: 2016-12-11 19:20:30
Usually this is because a miner knows a block was just found but wants to try winning the subsidy while they are still validating the recent block.  (They need to know which transactions have already been mined so they don't include them - that would result in an invalid block and wasted effort.)
There is work in the pipeline (like transaction ordering, weak blocks, etc.) that will help minimize this practice while the subsidy is still high enough to encourage mining a block without enough transactions worth the electricity cost.

Your full node is providing service to SPV wallet users, as well as historical blocks to new nodes. In order for it to do *you* any good you would want to point any other wallet you use to your own node. Breadwallet can do that.
All the underlying SegWit code is in your node, and it could create SegWit transactions using the RPC calls or the command line. The next, next version of Core - 0.15.2 - will come with SegWit transactions in the GUI. It wasn't added yet for security reasons, and because it wasn't certain to even be activated.

SegWit will double the number of transactions in each block.
How soon?  First it has to activate. In the meantime, most walllets people use (from Core, Electrum, to blockchain.info, &amp; Breadwallet, etc) are either already updated or will be soon. Since iOS and Android automatically update apps, it's likely that we'll see almost the full doubling in capacity within a couple months of activation.

I'm saying "fewer transactions" is not a guaranteed result.  LN is a scaling solution. If the scaling is unnecessary, then yes, there would be fewer transactions. Of course, if scaling is unnecessary, then we have a problem anyway.  Larger blocks would have a similar effect, if nobody shows up to use the extra blockspace, then fees will drop. 
Plus there's the other half of the price equation. Miners would try to reduce their costs to maintain profit with less revenue.
By far the most efficient way to mine would be to hash as a side-effect of producing heat. e.g., asics as a water heater element.  If a miner spent twice as much on electricity as they earn mining they'd go out of business. In this case though, you just cut your water heating bill in half.

If your scenario is to make regular smallish purchases each month or paycheck then Coinbase or Uphold are your best options.
Regular exchanges are good if you want to be a "trader," or if you want to buy a large enough at once to make a wire transfer fee a negligible recent of the cost.
You can make small cash purchases with LibertyX, or p2p trades via clearXchange (ACH) on Bitsquare, but the trade-off is the price is a bit higher.

e.g., a years worth of transactions (whether p2pk, LN channel ops, or sidechain conversions) waiting for confirmation wouldn't be good.

I like the analogy but it has some weaknesses.
In a car, bigger engine vs. turbo engine would generally be two approaches to similar performance, while with Bitcoin the BU approach wouldn't result in very much scaling at all compared to the Core approach.
I appreciate the discussion of the other exciting developments in the roadmap, but a bit more explanation of  just how severe are the systemic risks of merely making a larger engine (especially giving the control of that to miners,) would be helpful.

I think you've described the situation pretty well. However I think there's a lot of confusion over the term consensus in this debate. A 'pre-consensus' among developers and all other stakeholders prior to rolling out a new feature or change is a great thing to have but in no way can we expect everything to work that way. The idea behind the network is that a consensus on the valid chain will occur for economic reasons.
The longer it takes for users and node operators to decide which new protocol version will be the 'real' bitcoin the longer the system is effectively shut down.  While this scenario is temporarily a negative presumably the only reason the new branch got big enough to threaten to orphan those still using the old branch us because a large portion if the stakeholders believe the new feature is worth the pain.
If Bitcoin can't survive contentious forks, repeatedly, then it will have to be entirely centralized with a single official code development organization. This was fine and expected as it was being created but it's growing up now. Distributed development and resulting forks from one teams version to another should be expected.
Can Bitcoin survive and thrive as a truly distributed system?  I hope so. I think it can and I hope it does, but really the worst case scenario (other than a sudden lack of trust and interest after a difficult fork) is for two separate forks to both continue as separate duplicated chains. This wouldn't necessarily be destructive as long as wallets could be designed to handle the duplication and segregation into two new currencies. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:58:25
That's good advice - that's how I would do it too, but I don't think the reputability of bc.i is relevant.  When you send the transaction in CB, there's no way for them to know that the address was created or is accessed via blockchain.info  It's just an address.  If Coinbase can somehow identify that the single-use input address your mixing service gives you is in-fact a mixing service, then I suppose it's a valid point.
The return trip, from bc.i to coinbase is slightly different.  Theoretically Coinbase could watch and notice that the transaction is pushed to the network by bc.i's servers indicating that the user is using blockchain's wallet service to send the coins.

You're absolutely right about trade execution times - especially if your strategy utilizes HFT.  If you trade EOD (or even on 15 min bars,) I don't think 1 second trade settlement is a significant disadvantage.
I am personally of the opinion that no sane person would be inclined to store any significant amount of wealth with a financial institution which can arbitrarily, secretly and without explanation freeze, seize, or otherwise abscond with what you thought was yours.  I don't keep non-trading assets on an exchange.  If it looks like an opportunity is due I simply transfer funds into the exchange (transactions generally confirm within 15 mins) and then withdraw them immediately after exiting the trade.

Exactly.  Economics cannot predict anything, it can only guide decisions or interpret history.  That's why **ceteris paribis**.
Gravity says, **ceteris parabis**, things will fall.  Of course, *all might not be the same*, the 'thing' might have wings.  This doesn't change the fact that gravity is pulling down on a plane.  Just because aerodynamics can be stronger than gravity does not mean gravity is false.
Economics says, **cetaris parabis**, higher supply will *tend* to lower price.  Of course, *all might not be the same*, the item might become a collectible or fashionable.  This doesn't change the fact that an increased supply will place downward pressure on the price.  Just because unrelated upward price pressure overpowered this downward pressure does not mean the downward pressure is non-existent.

Consensus will likely always gravitate towards the protocol that offers the most value - the one that makes the currency the most valuable.

"Mainstream" economists like to think they can predict future statistics or prices.  They're full of shit.  Economics can't be *applied* like that, for the reasons you've stated.  
The 2008 bubble was a classic example of Austrian Business Cycle Theory.  An excess supply of credit money was being directed into the housing market.  The current inflated supply of credit money is even worse and it's being directed mostly into stocks.
Theoretical Economics is useful because it explains why these business cycles happen and what we could do if we wanted to eliminate them.   (Stop inflating the money supply with credit.)   We can't get rid of 'bubbles' in single industries or specific companies - (people get excited sometimes and miscalculate.)  But a wholesale bubble of the entire stock market is a symptom of an oversupply of credit and, *if that's the case*, it will *inevitably* lead to a wholesale market crash.
Bitcoin was designed specifically to work within the laws of economics.  Admittedly, aligning the incentives for every participant is incredibly complex, but if the system can be designed so that individual self-interest works in harmony it should succeed.  This is why Bitcoin is nearly unanimously praised among theoretical economists.  Mainstream and Keynesian economists who are always designing systems that try to flout economic theory - *and then try to 'fix' their systems with QE, price floors, tariffs, rent control or other destructive behaviors* - aren't able to easily grasp the concept.

They did make some changes to the algorithm after that report, however I don't think the study's conclusions were quite as negative as you remember.  Properly used, shared send significantly improves your privacy and plausible deniability.
Originally you could choose from 1 to 10 repetitions, and 1 shared send was shown to be linkable to the original input with fairly high confidence most of the time, while 10 repetitions significantly reduced the likelihood of a trace as well as confidence in the trace connection.  Now the feature just offers 'low' and 'high' security.  The more people using CoinJoin the better (and faster) it works.
It would be nice to know just how many repetitions would be effective at reducing chain analysis like Eclipse does to the point that tracing confidence becomes negligible.

Agreed, though I might qualify that with *'in spite of.'*  The capital investments in innovation resulting from legal protection of the basic human right to own property is a powerful force *in spite of* systemic market distortions.
However I also agree that the US Fed has done a better job than any other central bank at maintaining a relatively stable currency.  It's only lost 98% of it's purchasing power since inception.  The political spoils of the world wars and the US$ tied to purchasing petroleum have also helped to make it the world's reserve currency.
Unfortunately, if those many trillions of US$ start flowing back into the US we'll basically see a century's worth of deferred price inflation overnight.

I'm not saying the network would need to be centralized, the protocol development. We currently have two potential branches running. Mike Hearn wisely programmed xt to not execute the fork until it believes it's in a position to win. If and when xt activates big blocks we'll find out what a real hard fork looks like.

As to whether allowing irrational humans (benevolent or not) to *manage* global economies is a good idea - I'd just say, "look around."  I think clearly not.  They would have to know every single variable involved, which even the entire human race put together doesn't know.  It's doomed to fail.
Bitcoin is vastly superior to metal as a *hard currency* - I don't know if it will become the primary unit of account for the global economy, but it would be a very good idea.  If the price rises that would be strong evidence that more people are trying to get some than people trying to get rid of it (increased demand.)  It could also mean that the supply is decreasing (lost coins,) or some combination of both.   Can you imagine a change in price that does NOT reflect a change in supply, a change in demand, or both?  Another result of the intertwining of supply, demand and price is that changing the price (by legislation) changes the other two - resulting in shortages or gluts.
The only reason we can't use the Law of Supply and Demand to predict Price is because we can't possibly know what the variables are to plug in. - *the variables being the infinite capacity of Human Action.*  But the relationship between the three things, supply, demand and price, is a real relationship that *really exists.*
I'm not sure where your last paragraph comes from.  People certainly make plenty of mistakes when trying to act in what they think is the right way, but one way to really mess them up is to give them bad information - such as messing with prices and interest rates. *(Making the supply or demand look different than they really are.)*  If the yardstick of currency keeps changing it becomes useless to measure the value of one thing to another.  People will not *act more rationally* but they can make better decisions if the prices the market is communicating to them reflect the actual market value rather than what politicians want to imagine the value *should* be.  *Obviously we will never be able to price things in bitcoin until (if) bitcoin becomes ubiquitous - or at least more stable than the competition.*
**NOTE** - you've made me work hard to state the case for economics and I've enjoyed that.  **Thanks!**  You're correct that Economics is NOT a predictive science, but I maintain that through the use of purely deductive logic from synthetic *A Priori* axioms it IS capable of discovering Truth.

That's the common use of the phrase 'rational behavior.'  However, that's not how economists or philosophers use the term.  They mean merely that the action is the result of a process of thinking (rationalizing,) not an autonomic process like breathing or sweating.  Rather than an instinctive action that you have no control over, a *rational action* is something that you must consciously choose to do, - *regardless of whether or not it's a good choice.*
**Human Action** :  Human's act because they believe *(rightly or wrongly)* that the effect will be preferable *(in their own unique view of what's preferable, at this unique point in time)* compared to the effect of any other available action, *including doing nothing.* 
 -- It is from this, the Axiom of Human Action, that all economic theory (the study of human cooperation) is derived.  Now, it remains that there could be a logical flaw in the reasoning from axiom to conclusion, but none have been demonstrated in the century since the boys from Vienna figured this out.
We leave it to psychologists to attempt to explain *why* people prefer what they prefer.  An economist would say, after observing the action, that a person preferred sex today more than the promise of sex tomorrow.  This is termed the *time preference rate* and has a HUGE effect on a society's wealth.

You're right, there is a lot of use of 0-conf transactions (because there's currently no other way to do a trusted instant transaction, afaik.)  An RBF double-spend usually has a pretty low chance of success, so I don't think the problem is quite as bad as Mr. Todd made it out to be, but clearly it's a bad idea if the value of the transaction is high enough.  I think people who accept them are quite aware that they are accepting an unconfirmed transaction.
I can't predict what valuable use-cases might be invented in the future using RBF, but no one has shown how RBF can be prevented in a decentralized manner.  If it can't be prevented then it needs to be taken into account by the protocol.

You use the Law of Gravity as guidance when planning an orbital transfer.  It's most definitely a law, because it's ALWAYS true - regardless of the *evidence* of floating astronauts and flying rockets.
Increasing the supply of something will ALWAYS put downward pressure on prices. (How much and what the end price will be is too complex to model.)  But we can *know* that if we want prices to go down, increasing the supply is one of the things we can do to try to make that happen.  If prices happen to go up it certainly won't be *because* we tried to sell too many of the 'things.'
Economic law is logically deduced from the axiom of Human Action.  (In the same way mathematical theorems are deduced from unprovable axioms)  The  only way you can *logically* reject the conclusions of Economic Theory is to reject the axiom it's built on.  You would have to believe that humans act without ANY expectation that their actions will have some sort of effect on what they experience.  If anyone tries to convince you that they believe such nonsense the very *attempt to convince* will negate their own argument.

Some seem to think a controversial hard fork (not an upgrade, but two competing versions) would somehow result in a single fork 'winning.'
I don't think so. If a new version forked the blockchains, leaving 25% of the hash power on the old fork, would the Core development team just abandon their project?  Would users stop using it?  I don't think so. We would have two chains running on the same network. 
This would be a real mess from the user perspective - with a fairly simple solution. Make wallet software that monitors both chains. Your wallet would instantly show your old coins doubled, and it wouldn't matter which fork a transaction ended up on, the recipient would be able to spend them.
The end result of such a persistent fork would just be to double the total supply of Bitcoin.  Not really a 'win' in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:41:47
Yeah, it *could* have a big impact. Doubling the current supply would overshadow the reward halving a bit though. I think general uncertainty about the whole situation would also put downward pressure.
Personally, I'm very skeptical that Classic will actually cause a fork, even with its very low 75% threshold. Still, Bitcoin will survive, even if it's running on a double chain.

@_date: 2016-02-14 18:17:58
I don't see that.  As long as we develop wallets that monitor both chains and merge both of them at the wallet level, they can continue indefinitely. No merchant cares whether Visa or Mastrcard is processing your credit card payment. Why would anyone care which chain your transaction is on if it shows up in their wallet anyway?
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:27:17
Since Blockstream owners make up a small fraction of Core developers (1.5 full time paid developers,) any pull requests submitted contrary to the good of Bitcoin would simply be ignored.
Of course, since Blockstream's business model (private sidechains) requires Bitcoin itself to be successful, decentralized, and uncensored, it would be in their best interest that Bitcoin succeed - hence the reason they pay few of themselves to work on it. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:06:53
It's not going to split into two separate currencies. It will just split into two chains running on the same network. After the fork, miners will rush to whichever chain has the lowest difficulty until they stabilize at 50/50. User wallets will need to monitor both chains, so you can spend both copies of old coins, and receive new coins on either chain. The biggest difference in the end is that the total supply of Bitcoin will instantly double. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:00:33
Two years ago, part of the community wanted to change to 2MB blocks. Most developers said the risks of a HF were too high for such a trivial change.  Then, they realized they could actually implement 2MB blocks as a soft fork (via SegWit.)
I suppose you could call that a compromise, but there are good technical reasons to change from 'blocksize' to 'blockweight.'
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:35:06
That's not what I'm suggesting. Scan both blockchains and utxo sets - sum all the bitcoin residing at your addresses into one wallet balance. Then users can send and receive payments without worrying about the stupid fork.

They haven't told their customers about their chips' ASICBOOST feature, or provided the microcode to use it.  They're getting at least a 20% success bonus, which amounts to 10X more marginal profit than their customers, or anyone else.  Possibly as much as $100 Million.  SegWit would cut off their cash cow, as would a UASF.
Or, we can let everyone do it, transparently;  no license fees, level playing field, and works fine with commitments.   
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:00:35
It would be a very wise idea to get those done before increasing the block size - they will dramatically decrease the bandwidth and orphan risk impact.
I, however, would much prefer a dynamic flex-cap that allows for unbounded growth (Black Friday scaling) while still preventing a DOS tx attack. A fixed 2MB limit is a half-assed temporary adjustment- it's not a fix.

If there is even a single transaction in a block which includes witness data, then the miner is obligated to include a commitment - said miner won't be able to use ASICBOOST.
Said miner would be horrified to see SegWit activated, because that would mean witness data would start showing up in blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:57:43
On the other hand, if you want multiple miners to compete to secure your transactions (even if you fail to provide your identity and source of funds,) then go ahead and continue being concerned about block size.

It's a good article, but I think it's overly pessimistic. First he claims that LN will lead to a type of centralization because it will need large firms to provide liquidity, then he points out the economic disadvantage to locking up significant sums of bitcoin — the very argument that implies the system will naturally gravitate towards decentralization even if it started with a hub-n'-spoke model.
I fully agree with the criticism of 6 month long channels. One or two weeks seems more likely. The distance between typical paychecks.
The routing problem. Sure, it sounds difficult. Similar to the censorship resistant mesh networks that some privacy groups are working on. Is it intractable?  I doubt it.
Will the fact that State sponsored corporations be limited in their ability to benefit from LN affect OUR ability to use it?  I don't see why.
Yep, the Bitcoin network itself needs to handle more transactions. It is not technically possible for a distributed blockchain to scale to millions of transactions per second, but it can (and will) handle many more than now — once we figure out how to mitigate orphan risk. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:42:09
It was discovered that Bitmain included secret attack capabilities (patented as ASICBOOST) in their mining chips that gives them a 20% advantage over other miners - but the attack won't work with SegWit (hence the obvious conclusion why they're pretending to support BU to block SegWit.)
Greg Maxwell published a BIP soft fork to block the attack vector (covert ASICBOOST.) yesterday.

Two years after SegWit activation, you pull out your Trezor and use your old version of the software, your bitcoin will be perfectly spendable.
Most people use wallet software that updates regularly.  Particularly phone software - which often prompts to update.  Most transactions will be SegWit within a year - it's all invisible technical background stuff users won't see.
LNs may be a wallet add-ons, plug-ins, or native implementations of the BOLT standard.  Lightning *will* have a UI and user choices to make.
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:33:18
I imagine with a *persistent, contentious* hard fork exchanges and wallets would end up supporting both chains. The same way a credit card processor supports both Visa and MasterCard.  If you want to send someone 5BTC using old inputs, you just send 2.5, which they'll receive on each chain. Using new coins, it doesn't matter which chain is used, their wallet can receive both.
All it really does is double the coin supply. Miners would flock to the chain with the lowest difficulty until they settle at 50/50. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:44:21
It's likely that bitcoin purchases will be a very small fraction of sales (for some time,) but on each of those you'll save the CC fees. I can't see any drawbacks to accepting via Bitpay.

I suppose it depends on what a 'large sum' means. Perhaps you pay your regular monthly bills via verifiable, auditable, on-chain transactions — ten or so a month — and deposit a couple hundred a week into one or more payment channels for your daily spending.
If LN fees are actually high enough to make locking up funds merely for the return financially attractive (compared to all other possible investments) then it probably won't even work for micropayments. The strongest incentive to open a channel (like buying a gift card) is because you actually expect to spend that money and want instant, cheap payments.

Are there a lot of those places accepting bitcoin directly rather than using a processor like Bitpay?  Are any grocery stores getting a significant percentage of sales in bitcoin?

Bitcoin has never had an ideologically driven fork.

Tau Chain is even more promising than Ethereum (if it will really work.) Ethereum contracts are redundantly run by every node - just like Bitcoin transactions are verified by every node. This is stupid wasteful for a distributed computer.  Tau Chain provides 'proof-of-run' and can enable different nodes to run different pieces of your application.

If a bank has $100 on deposit they can (and will) extend loans totaling $1,000. That's what fractional reserve banking with a 10% reserve ratio means.

Jeff Garzik offered to write the s2x code. Maybe he thought "here's my chance to be important again."  Idk.

It's very simple. The existing fee estimation algorithm most wallets use is faulty. If it sees high fees in blocks it assumes those are the appropriate fee - it's a feedback that produces excessively high estimates.
The algorithm in the next version (0.15.0) is vastly superior. Hopefully most wallets will implement the improvement soon, along with SegWit which cuts fees up to 50%.

We don't know what effect it will have on transaction fees.  We don't know what effect it will have on centralization.  The latter is particularly troublesome. Will govt agents instruct miners to only process transactions between identified individuals?
Other things we don't know.  Will people use Lightning Networks?  Will a large portion of transactions move to a Zerocash based sidechain?  I don't think we should let the network hit the current 1MB limit (that would be a change with unexpected consequences,) but we certainly need to be very careful that we don't make a wrong move at this stage.  It could set us up for disaster down the road.

Actually I drill for oil.
Validating transactions before mining them or forwarding them to a miner is *important.*  As is validating a new block to ensure it's actually attached to the blockchain.  If validation - the process of accepting and forwarding a new transaction to the mining pools - *cannot* be done anonymously then Bitcoin node operators could easily be threatened with physical force in order to ensure compliance with arbitrary political rules for transactions.  The same vulnerability to political whims would exist if anonymous mining was *impossible.*
Currently transactions *can* be validated and confirmed anonymously (to the extent TOR or a VPN is anonymous.)  If we allow the on-chain transaction rate to grow without bound it's *possible* that this state of affairs will cease to exist.
The 1MB limit is arbitrary and it's likely that it can be increased safely - to some extent.  But, we need to focus scalability development on methods that present **minimal to no risk** of centralizing the network to the point that it's vulnerable to threat of violence.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:15:49

We certainly don't want everyone 'required' to operate a validating node, but if it's too expensive (either economically or legally) to start one up to check for yourself that you've really received a payment - whether it's a direct transaction or a settlement from a lightning hub or sidechain - then it's *not* P2P.

The purchasing power of money will naturally increase as technology and productivity increase.  If our money supply had stayed relatively stable over the last 100 years it would be obvious how much cheaper things are now compared to then.
Using our current inflating system, comparing the value of two different items, like a 32 inch tube TV in 1995 and a 32 inch TV today is very difficult to do via price.  It's like using a meter that is constantly slowly shrinking.
With a stable money supply and the resulting *increase* in purchasing power, it becomes rational to save and accumulate capital.  It becomes rational to invest only in wise investments rather than gambling in markets just to maintain the value of your retirement fund.  Most of the bad effects of central banking can be blamed on the insane goal of propping up prices even as progress drives prices down.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:02:59
I don't think storage is the real bottleneck.  Bandwidth is the potential issue.
There are, as you've mentioned, multiple optimizations that can be added to a validating node, including transmitting just the hashes of a newly solved block rather than every transaction included.  This in itself would cut the bandwidth in half.
However, the technical capability for bandwidth itself is only part of the issue.  The forwarding nodes and the mining pools need to be immune from threat of force.  If it's as easy to identify a pool operator or miner as it is to identify the president of a bank, then the blockchain will eventually be subject to arbitrary *political* rules.  Transactions can be rejected without AML/KYC information attached, addresses can be blacklisted, the flow of capital can be controlled and purchases could be restricted.  It needs to be *possible* for at least 51% of the mining power to be immune to threat of force - to be anonymous.
We can hope that TOR or anonymous VPN's will be capable of handling as much bandwidth as Bitcoin will ever use, or we can focus scalability development on solutions that do not require unbounded on-chain transaction growth.

Bitcoin CAN handle as many transactions as Visa and MasterCard put together and it can do it without third party trust or giving up decentralization. It could easily do this within a year or two. It just can't be done by putting every micro transaction in the blockchain.   The chain should be optimized for maximum distribution / resiliency from control by special interests. Making Bitcoin weaker, even a little, for no reason whatsoever is foolish.  Bitcoin can be made scalable without making it weaker.

You can put one in a TV and it will automatically purchase your show (one $1 show per month.)  Sure, it would cost more because you're purchasing electricity -&gt; turning it into bitcoin -&gt; then buying the show instead of just buying the show directly, but hey, it's still cool right?
Or, it could make two 1 satoshi transactions per day (at current rates.)  Still not sure why turning my $0.25 kwh electricity into bitcoin worth less than the electricity costs makes sense.

*Short term* stability in the value of money is necessary.  It's also impossible to actually measure, as money merely measures the value of one commodity relative to another commodity.  *Long term* it's completely irrelevant.  There is nothing wrong with the currency supply remaining fixed and the gradual reduction in *prices* accurately reflecting the increase in productivity. (Or the increase in prices caused by destruction of capital, a la warehouse fires, earthquakes, etc.)
There is no drawback to being able to purchase twice as much with your $10 bill today as you could have if you'd spent it 20 years ago.
The tech industry is pretty good evidence that constantly decreasing prices does not damage an economy.  The new iPhone sells even though everyone knows that they can get twice as much phone at half the price if they wait a couple of years.  Nobody will put off buying food for a month just because they can get a little more for their money if they wait.
Not only would creating a fixed value money be impossible, the calculation itself is impossible.

It's my understanding that CT produces very large transactions, much too large to just be added to the main blockchain at this point.  Compact Confidential Transactions was shown to be weak, although work is continuing to fix it.  Ideally CCT and CoinJoin will eventually be added to the Bitcoin protocol itself -  though I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a couple of years. Those two combined with an address control capable wallet and remote broadcast would likely provide enough privacy to make bitcoin safe-to-use again for it's old first-use-case (after the pizza &amp; alpaca socks, that is.) 
Sidechains offer the promise of Zerocash, among many other awesome non-privacy related possibilities.  My relatively uninformed impression is that 2 way pegs (for sidechains) and a transaction malleability fix (to enable LN) are in the testing pipeline.  Less than 1 year, I would imagine.
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:40:47
Okay, that's a valid criticism.
Your *sent* transactions need to find a mining pool that will not refuse your transaction because you haven't provided your personal identity and the source of your income.   Unfortunately, if a mining pool is required to operate under legal threat, it probably won't accept blocks containing *legally* invalid transactions either.  If even 51% of the network is subject to such *legal* transaction rules then the entire blockchain is compromised.  The only defense is anonymous mining.
If on-chain transaction bandwidth is high enough to make anonymous mining impossible, then every miner will be *potentially compromised* and easily subject to force.  If it becomes possible for governments to compromise the network, they will do so - if only to enhance their tax collection abilities.
A non-mining node is valuable if you want to check to see if your *received* transaction is valid, rather than trusting whatever blockchain.info or Coinbase tells you.

The ability to use the Bitcoin blockchain's security to timestamp a huge variety of assets is something that would require vastly increasing the transactions per block as well as keeping transaction fees low.  Looking forward, transaction fees will be the way the security is financed.  Will a high number of low fee transactions provide as much revenue as a low number of high fee transactions?  I haven't seen any research or calculations regarding this.
It's important to note, however, that the only reason to put all those assets on the blockchain is because the blockchain itself is the most secure place to put them - more secure than any available sidechain.  If the network evolves in such a way that mining pools and node operators *cannot* operate anonymously, then the security of the system will be compromised and much of the promise Bitcoin offers for individual empowerment will be lost.  As soon as a number of governments decide together that they need to track and identify transactions to combat tax-evasion, any pool or node operator that can be personally identified will be forced into compliance.  It would no longer be P2P cash.
I have no 'new' ideas, but perhaps if a majority of the mining network was shared-mining a number of sidechains, then initiatives that need to place large numbers of transactions on a secure public chain could use those sidechains.
@_date: 2015-09-10 11:30:51
The only objective measure of the network's level of decentralization is the cost of starting an anonymous transaction validating node.  Any increase in that cost decreases the potential robustness of the system.  BitTorrent is an unstoppable system because it's so *easy* to participate as a *peer*.  Every effort should be made to ensure Bitcoin is an unstoppable P2P system.
I don't understand the insistence on scaling to 32GB blocks instead of developing LN and optimizing solved block transfers to just transaction hashes.

You might be right, though I would expect if nodes are relatively inexpensive to operate they would also be easy to anonymize. 
Widespread adoption would make a certain kind of political attack (banning bitcoin) unlikely but it could make another type of attack very feasible *for the public good*.

*Validating* a transaction or a new block simply means verifying that it is in fact valid.  Nodes *validate* transactions and blocks *before* forwarding them.  Either you do that yourself, or you trust someone else.  A *fully-validating* node does not need to be a miner, it just needs to have either a full copy of the blockchain or a provably pruned copy.
32GB is the implemented final blocksize limit in BIP101.  If they ever actually reach that size it will be impossible to run a node anonymously (due to bandwidth use) and nodes *will* be easily subject to capital controls, MSB licensing, address blacklisting, AML/KYC or whatever other tricks the incumbent competition can persuade the various world states to implement.
With the other options proposed, Bitcoin could fit billions of trustless, anonymous transactions per day within 1MB blocks.  Maybe 8MB blocks would be a good idea since LN and SC are still in development - maybe even larger than that to handle 1000's of LN hubs (as long as the bandwidth *allows* anonymous, force-immune nodes.)  **Maybe we don't even need a maxblocksize limit, but the goal of fitting *every* transaction on the blockchain (24GB+ blocks) would probably result in a currency system controlled not by P2P code but by men with guns.**
The financial world is no longer laughing at us.  We can expect them to start fighting now with regulations intended to *control* (and tax) the flow of money *within* the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:55:21
Just because someone tells you that your transaction has been added to the blockchain *(confirmed)* 6 blocks deep doesn't mean you know it's *valid.*  If you really want to know you need to crunch the numbers and validate that those blocks are valid blocks.  **Validation** and **Confirmation** are entirely different terms.
So, is the plan to *hope* that TOR (or some other anonymizing protocol) can handle Gb per second speeds in the future rather than develop other perfectly achievable options to scalability now?

The public internet is not P2P. Economic costs are one thing. Legal costs are even more destructive. Most of the worlds population cannot simply set up any old website due to censorship restrictions. 
Trying to fit 10 minutes worth of transactions for 9 Billion people into a single block will require bandwidth that would put an individual peer node out of reach of most of its users.  It would be the opposite of a peer to peer system. It would be hub and spoke with the hubs easily identified and controlled by attackers. 
It doesn't bode well that many people want to prevent Bitcoin from becoming a worldwide method for individuals to transfer value directly with each other just to fit all the transactions on the blockchain.

Yes, we have that choice right now.  Hopefully we will continue to have that choice.  If the network becomes centralized enough that a nefarious bureaucrat can easily identify a node or mining pool operator they could force them to reject or filter transactions.
The IRS would only need to point guns at 51% of the mining pools in order to enforce AML/KYC rules, prohibit certain purchases or prevent someone from accessing their money.  Even if you agree that no one should be allowed to spend or earn a dollar without a permission slip from the government, this would still destroy bitcoin.

A quantum computer should be able to derive a private key from a public key, however an address is a hash of the public key.  QC will be of no use in reversing an address into the public key it came from.

In an IoT world, which of your electrical devices would you like to consume dramatically more electricity than they do now?  Certainly not your mobile devices!  The issue with embedded mining is that mining is mostly a way to turn electricity into heat.  An efficient chip can make it a break-even device, meaning you get a heat source for free, but the economics of mining to profitably turn electricity bitcoin is very geared towards centralization.  I think to broadly decentralize the mining ecosystem we need the 'waste' heat to be the primary product with mining as a way to subsidize the cost of producing that heat.

A bitcoin address is a hash of the public key.  A transaction publishes the public key and is signed with the private key.  A verifying node can easily hash the now visible public key to see that it in fact turns into the public address, as well as verify that the signature matches the public key.
In theory a quantum computer could reverse a public key into the secret key, but it is not theoretically possible to reverse a hash (an address) into the number (the public key) it came from.  The lesson here is that you should never reuse an address.  Once you've spent from an address, the public key is on the blockchain.
Here's an example:  A hash is not an 'encryption', it can't be reversed because the information is lost.  The last digit on a credit card number (called a check-sum) is a very simple hash of all the previous numbers.  There's simply no way to take the last digit and figure out the whole credit card number from it.

On-chain tx require a fee of around 2 - 3 cents each to confirm in a timely manner.  That's *far* too high for anything claiming to be a *micro*transaction.

A bank account is more analogous to a Bitcoin wallet, not a single address in a wallet.
You're very correct that Bitcoin wallet software needs to be significantly easier to use, among many other improvements, before it's likely to attract widespread use.  Stealth addresses are an elegant solution as they give you a single receive address that doesn't publicly link all your behavior. Unfortunately they require a full node to use correctly, so they haven't been widely implemented (most wallets can't send or receive from them.)
Address reuse is a serious security risk. Do you really want every thief and thug in the world to know exactly how much money you have and how you use it?

If an attacker has the master public key (which a wallet shouldn't use for an address) AND at least one private key from one of the deterministic addresses, then they can identify all your public keys. (They could read all your transactions)

Smart contracts are a pretty good reason to enable things like CLTV and RBF, even though they may not be useful for standard transactions.  I thought it was communicated clearly; it seems a lot of people aren't interested in listening.
However, I think the *main* reasons are block compression and facilitating an efficient fee market.  The attack vector that caused Satoshi to originally remove RBF from the earlier versions is no longer a threat, so it makes sense to add it back in.

That's a beautiful image of our star!
No, it doesn't hold true for QC. The vulnerability is that QC could possibly calculate the Secret Key from a Public Key. However, you have to have the PK to pull that off. A Bitcoin address is actually a 160bit hash of a PK - which even QC can't reverse.  SHA-256 won't be broken by QC either so the blockchain will be safe. 
When you spend from an address, you have to reveal the PK, but as long as an address has never been spent from your money is safe. This is one reason (not the most important right yet) to never reuse an address.  If the QC is so fast it can break keys in seconds, then it would be possible to watch the mempool and attempt double-spends before confirmation, so if a quantum computer comes online before we've replaced ECDSA then we'll have to stop using it until it's fixed, but in the meantime all coins in never-spent addresses will be safe.
Tl/dr : never reuse an address and the money is safe, but Bitcoin will still need to be updated with Quant safe cryptography.

We need to enable a million tx per second. Anything less is pointless. The next influx of users (real daily users) will be billions - unless of course nothing at all happens.

Using Bitcoin as designed allows someone with a little skill the ability to read your 'account statements' and purchase receipts in real-time. Reusing a single address allows any idiot in the world to do the same.

Low numbers like 2 - 8MB shouldn't make running a full node too difficult in well connected areas (US, EU, parts of Asia,) but they *could* have a significant impact on miner orphan rates.  The other primary concern is that a hard fork itself (regardless what it's for) is risky.

The only real current competition to Bitcoin as a currency is Dash (for user interface) and Monero (for fungibility.)

Merged mining is a method of applying the same hashing power to two separate blockchains.  Namecoin is almost always merge mined with Bitcoin.  In other words, when you merge mind BTC and NMC, you earn both BTC and NMC rewards (and tx fees) at the same time.
Of course, the sidechain would have to use the same POW as Bitcoin.  You couldn't merge mine Bitcoin and a Monero or Zerocash sidechain, those would require their own POW networks.

Only recently has the network started bumping up against the 1MB cap.

We'll probably want to replace ECDSA with a quantum resistant algorithm (of which there's no really good option yet.)  Prohibiting address reuse might be a workable alternative. 
EDIT: single use of addresses may NOT be an alternative if a private key can be recovered and a double spend submitted before a transaction is confirmed. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:40:42
I never said it replaces the need to increase the blocksize limit.
No they can't keep your money.  The channel will close automatically when the expiration date is reached anyway, and then you'll get your money back.  You're going to have to pay a transaction fee no matter what.  (Actually, I think the fee has to be paid to open the channel.  Closing the channel just finalizes the accumulated mass-transaction. - I could be wrong. Is it two separate txs?  Do you have to pay to both open and close it?  It would still be far less than separate miner fees for every tx!)
You're right, it wouldn't make sense to open a payment channel if the amount you plan to use (for the week, month or whatever) isn't enough to justify the cost of the transaction.  If network latency is so high that miner's are restricting their blocksize too severely, (or if there's a hard-coded cap) then it's possible that fees will get so high that no one will use the network.
Obviously we don't want fees too high, but if fees are too low then miner's will have to add so many transactions to a block just to make a positive income that latency and orphan risk become a problem.  One obvious solution to this is to put all the miners in one or a few datacenters.  (NYC has some of the fastest hubs on the planet.  NYDFS would probably love to oversee them.)
And none of this has anything to do with my argument that LN doesn't necessarily deprive miner's of enough revenue to secure the network.

AFAIK it's never happened yet.  But considering that &gt;50% of the hashing power is within China's borders, if they wanted to (by nationalizing the miners, or requiring they update their software) they could refuse to mine transactions that they believe are Chinese citizens trying to move funds out of the country.
On the other hand, if it is possible at all, in any way, to prevent a transaction from being mined simply with a friendly visit to a few miner's offices, then it absolutely will happen.  To prevent terrorism financing or contraband purchases, and even more likely, to prevent people from spending money they haven't paid taxes on.
I don't want it to sound like I think illicit uses are Bitcoin's primary function, because they're not, but if bitcoin cannot be used for illicit purposes then it's not cash.  Perhaps the benefits of a deflationary currency would still be there, but much of the promise for individual privacy and autonomy would be lost.

So, why just double capacity?  Let's increase it by 1,000,000x. We need to fit a few million tx's into the 1MB we have now before it will make sense to increase it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 09:14:58
One possible use case is simply to make sure you're sending to the right address. You send a transaction with the RBF bit set and if your receiver acknowledges that their wallet sees it then you're good to go, just leave it alone to confirm as usual. If it doesn't show up in the receiver's wallet then you may have mistakenly sent it to the wrong address, so you can hopefully cancel it (if it hasn't confirmed yet) and try again.
Same if you accidentally sent the wrong amount. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:09:44
It's difficult to predict technological progress, but it's actually much more difficult to predict the other half of that equation - just how quickly and how high will transaction rates grow?  If tx rates grow faster than non-commercial bandwidth or affordable hardware then we'll have a problem.
I say non-commercial because it's much easier to pass and enforce regulations on what happens in datacenters than what people do in their own homes.

I don't think you can broadcast just a single LN transaction, you would have to close the entire channel settling all the payments made and returning any funds you haven't spent yet.  It would still be one transaction to settle the entire channel.  Yes, it would suck that you would have to open another channel with another provider that month costing you an extra transaction fee, but hopefully you choose a more reputable node next time.

The 'general' exposure for Bitcoin is positive.  The user experience of capital controls is not.  Most people generally expect that they can withdraw their money from their bank account at will, that they can write a check for any amount up to the value of their account and it will be good.
The transaction limits are likely a type of fraud protection - like daily limits on an ATM card.

The distributed (or at least decentralized) security of Bitcoin is paramount. With the insanely long tx confirmation time (avg 10 mins) Bitcoin is clearly not intended to be a replacement for Visa. It's supposed to replace banks (3 day tx times)
We can build a fast payment system on top of Bitcoin to handle billions of transactions - we can even build it to be trustless (LN), or anonymous (SC).  But in irder for the whole system to resist coercive interference it must be as easy as possible to run a validating node.
Perhaps we don't need a hard block size cap at all - we don't really know what the natural balance might be between tx fees and orphan risk that would incentivize soft limits set by miners. The caution exhibited by most of the dev team is well warranted.
In the other hand, we are now entering uncharted territory. The network has never been really affected by the current 1MB limit. In a sense, we are now about to find out what having a limit will do. At minimum we need to keep the limit above the choke point until there are optional layers to use.

No it's an algorithm.  It's a trust-less method to mix coins.  Blockchain.info uses it for the Send Shared feature.  (I don't know of any other wallet's that have integrated it.)  I've used Send Shared many times.
Probably the best implementation is JoinMarket, but it's still a bit of a manual process to set it up.  It can be implemented in a wallet, it doesn't need to be added to the core protocol, but the transactions are obviously CoinJoin transactions and the more participants the better they work, so to really work well it would be best if they were standard, common, default transactions.

A hash is not exactly an encrypted or compressed form of data. A good hash function produces a number unique to what was put in, but doesn't contain it. It can't be reversed.
Example. The last digit of a credit card # is a checksum - a very simple hash - of the rest of the number. It's a weak hash, because there are only 10 digits (0-9) and it's easy to find a collision - that is, many credit cards end in the same digit. However, you sure can't take '7' and figure out the rest of my card   But just like it's used in Bitcoin, it's trivial to 'hash' the first 15 digits and see if they match the last digit.  A hash is easy to run but impossible to un-run. 
So, even though a QC should be able to calculate a secret key from a public key, it can't un-hash an address to find the public key.
@_date: 2015-11-13 23:15:15
You're correct that pseudonymity helps, and increasing that with Confidential Transactions or CoinJoin can make it so even if someone could filter transactions, they wouldn't have any idea which transactions to filter.
As for just how easy it would be to implement a filter wide enough to prevent a given address you want to block from being used, that really depends on how much centralization you have.  You might notice that the network backbone industry in the US is centralized enough that the NSA was able to place filters that intercept (and modify) every email sent in the US.

If fees are too low, then miners will have to cram so many transactions into a single block just to break-even that block sizes will be large enough to run into latency and increased orphan risk.  The obvious solution to this is to just put all the miners in one or a few datacenters.

Well, SegWit took longer than they hoped, didn't it?  That's pretty understandable with a system like this and to be expected with open source projects.

I think a hard fork could take just as long. The majority of nodes would be rejecting the 75% of blocks coming from miners who upgraded until they upgraded as well.

The possibility of the blockchain being incorrect (double spends, reversals, etc.) is obviously a serious trust issue, but as you've pointed out I don't think it takes very much decentralization to defend against that.
The trust that I think is far more difficult to achieve is the trust that if I submit a transaction it will actually get included in a block and not filtered out because of taint, or black listing.  THAT's the real issue here with the need for broad decentralization.  We need the system distributed enough that at least somebody somewhere will mine our transaction into a block regardless of how large the majority is who refuse to do so.

I don't think it's technically possible to receive, verify and re-broadcast a Visa level transaction rate on today's typical home broadband connections, no matter how you modify the protocol.  LN is the only realistic proposal I've heard yet.  The Bitcoin blockchain can scale, but it can't scale nearly that large without just putting all the miners and nodes into a few datacenters.  The only real solution is to get most of the work off the main chain - while ensuring that the main chain is as decentralized and secure as possible, since it will still be securing all those LN transaction settlements.
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:08:23
You're still wasting resources.
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:43:39
LN doesn't necessarily conflict with the blockchain for transaction fees.  Whether you make 150 on-chain transactions a month with a 10cent fee or a single LN channel settlement transaction per month with a $15 fee, the amount miners earn is the same.
The LN nodes are intended to handle high transaction volume (and they don't have the expense of mining,) so they could be quite profitable with small fees, say 1cent per transaction.  That adds only 1.50 per month to your "banking expenses" in this example.

Bread is a true SPV wallet. It's possible that the node you connected to dropped offline temporarily, or otherwise delayed forwarding your tx to the network. The ideal solution doesn't exist yet - the ability to securely connect to specified nodes you choose (like your own at home.)
Most other mobile wallets use a "trusted" server to relay your transactions. With those, your transactions might be more reliably broadcast (and aren't publicly linked to your IP,) but note the trick word, "trusted".
Your experience here is pretty uncommon. Breadwallet is one of the best.

I suppose it depends on whether all 100 nodes are owned by the same person, or if they're all located in the same facility, or perhaps if all those nodes are publicly identifiable and subject to confiscation and manipulation by a nefarious party.
How exactly do you measure trust?  It sounds a bit like measuring happiness.  I'm not sure math will help much.  I think the closest you can get is measuring people who are using it.  If they're using the system, then they trust it.  If they're not then they don't.

That's why the 95% threshold - to ensure newly invalid blocks (valid by old rules, but violate SegWit,) orphan regularly without excessive chain forking, ensuring the consensus on the blockchain prevents any SegWit stealing from getting deeply confirmed.
Core intentionally refuses to put in an auto-update feature in the node. They insist the choice to use Core is 100% voluntary. If you want the new rules you have to update yourself.

Yeah, I don't think 'trusted mining' is a good idea.  Nothing wrong with a person publicly claiming their hashpower, but that's nothing to rely on.
I'm quite curious about p2pool and distributed mining.  I don't know the details and I don't understand why it appears to have almost completely fizzled on the hash ratio charts.  But I'm thinking that integrating something like p2pool into the protocol itself - mandating that block contents and transaction selection rules follow criteria set in open-source code - would eliminate much of the centralization concern.
We would still want to avoid all the mining and validating occurring in concentrated geographical locations, but at least the prospect of China suddenly deciding to consolidate all it's hashpower and censor transactions would be gone.

You need to "send" the bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet to an address in your Copay wallet. This is much easier to do by scanning a QR code, but you can copy/paste if necessary. (*Very* risky to try typing in a bitcoin address.)
In Coinbase wallet, select Send and paste (or scan) your Copay receive address.
Note, keeping your bitcoin at Coinbase is no more "wrong" than keeping your pesos in a bank - it's a choice between trusting yourself to run your own bank or trusting a professional banker to keep your cash safe.    -    The risks: you lose your own money or the bank allows someone to steal your money.

It's no more "wrong" to keep your savings in Coinbase than it is keeping them in CapitalOne, however, Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank.

You're ignoring the special (but huge) use case of a private permissioned blockchain that eliminates multiple middlemen and centralized data storage for asset transaction settlements via smart contracts.  There is a huge amount of wasted time and effort spent verifying and recording in the back-ends of financial systems. It goes far beyond just instant wire transfers. There's a whole set of software involved in settling stock and bond purchases, mortgage payments, and everything else that is about to be obsolete due to private access distributed ledgers. 
The 'banks' may fail as bitcoin replaces fiat but the equities, commodities, derivates and commercial paper financial systems will be MUCH more efficient than they are now. All that activity belongs on private ledgers, not on the primary currency blockchain.

The only difference would be the location of a single hash. With a HF we could put the witness commitment in the header rather than in the coinbase transaction.

You received 0.04 into one address and then spent all of it, 0.01 going to another wallet, and the rest going to a new address in your own wallet. Because the tx hasn't confirmed yet, both the 0.01 you sent and the change you received are still pending.
It's how it works. Bitcoin can't spend only part of what's in an address. It has to spend all of it, so it "spends" what remains back to you. 
If you had other coins in other addresses, those would still be in your wallet (not pending.)

No no.  A distributed permissioned blockchain is completely different from an RDBMS.  Just because it doesn't require POW for security doesn't make it a relational database.  It's still a chain of unreversable dependently hashed blocks. (Instead of redoing the POW, you would have to resign with someone else's key.)
They should be FAR more robust (no central database failure can shut down every brokerage using the system) and the implementation of complex rule sets for derivatives is MUCH simpler (smart contract features.)  The cryptographically assured chain of ownership eliminates most of the work involved in verifying regulatory record keeping compliance.

As soon as you receive a new key block you can start working on the next key block while the miner who found it signs and broadcasts microblocks.  As soon as you find a key block, because it's small and travels across the network quickly, everyone will immediately start looking for the next key block while you sign and broadcast microblocks (you also start looking for the next key block as well.)
Nobody has to wait for microblocks and the broadcast time of key blocks is as quick as technically possible, so the orphan risk will be as low as possible.

A worker owned factory is private property. People who don't work there aren't allowed to decide how it's used.  You're describing an entire factory controlled by a handful of the world's population.  If they want to use democracy as a decision making process, that's fine, as long as everyone has the liberty to quit and voluntarily join some other workplace. Of course, they're risking losing not just a job but everything they invested in building the factory if the business fails.  I never buy ownership in my employer.

Currently, you receive a new block (which takes more time the larger it is) and then you validate every transaction in it (which takes time) *before* you can stop mining on the last block and restart on this newly received block.
SPV mining basically solves this issue as you really only need to receive and check the header for the new block before you can start mining on top of it.  Of course, then you're not validating *any* transactions, you're trusting that the full nodes you connect to have done it properly for you.

It sounds like you're asking "If I write software to use with 21's micro transaction server, and then 21 changes how their server works, breaking my code, will I be out of luck?"
I think the answer would be yes.
Any micro transaction business will need to use someone's trusted layer, whether it's changetip, 21, or someone else. The blockchain itself isn't a good place to sell services that cost only a few cents each (such as as free web pages.)

The block reward is temporary. Eventually mining will be supported only by transaction fees. In just a few years, most of their revenue will be fees.
Suppose a miner could make a block large enough to empty the mempool. Immediately afterwards, and for a few minutes, there wouldn't be enough fees in the mempool to make mining worthwhile. (Without a significant block reward.)  Miners would have to stop hashing until some more fees piled up.
This constant, up-and-down hashrate would be incredibly destructive. Even immediately after a full block is mined there needs to be enough transactions available to make another block.
In fact, since the network gets lucky sometimes, we probably want at least several blocks worth of transactions always available to mine.
Of course, we don't want an infinitely growing transaction backlog either, just enough to keep the hash rate stable.

Yes, it's possible. The slower you trade the easier it is to actually profit.
It's also tricky. Learning to trade often involves significant losses while learning.
It's also fun. Use perhaps 10% of your bitcoin to fund a trading account - but certainly not more than you can stand to lose.

The problem is precisely that they restrict your ability to move those coins to another wallet.  I think their vision for the product is to provide it like a virtual ATM card, with daily spending limits and all.  Move a few funds into Circle, spend them, then move some more in, etc.

Bitcoin transactions used to be free but they were *never* instant.
I recall weusecoins used to advertise cheap/fast as a benefit of bitcoin. I don't know why - maybe they didn't understand Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a *sound* currency that with widespread use would allow price signals to actually communicate accurate information - which is necessary for a market to function.
It's a deflationary currency which would protect the purchasing power of your retirement savings, encourage capital accumulation (the only cure for poverty,) and discourage both unnecessary spending and foolish malinvestment.
Bitcoin, used properly, protects privacy, property, and individual human dignity. It cannot be arbitrarily seized or devalued by anyone. 
Bitcoin is cold, hard, digital cash. Thieves want it; drug dealers accept it; it's good money.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:50:12
It's true that the electricity used to process bitcoin transactions *could* be used for something else, but the only way to measure *waste* is by accounting loss. The cost of mining is paid for by users fees. Apparently, the people actually paying for the electricity believe they're getting what they want. (Getting their transaction confirmed.)
It's actually quite difficult to make money mining. The computers have to be constantly monitored, repaired, and replaced. Due to continuous competition and difficulty increases, mining income doesn't last very long.

You know they can't actually keep your money, right?  It's trustless because you always have the option to close the channel at any time.  You can't lose a single bit using an LN node.  The node can also close the channel early if they don't want your business anymore.  There's no rational reason to block a transaction, especially if privacy additions to the protocol prevent them from knowing who you're paying and how much.
You *CAN* get screwed if you buy something from a lousy plumber.  Bitcoin is cash.  There are no chargebacks.  If you're not prepared to take responsibility for your choices then you should avoid bitcoin.

I'm not looking at SegWit2x, I'm looking at BIP 9 signaling, which is at 45%. If it's at 55% by Aug 1st, BIP 148 will successfully orphan the non-signaling blocks - activating SegWit without a chain fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:05:36
The UASF code is a one shot deal. It will simply reject blocks that fail to signal with bit 1, resulting in a chain with 100% bit 1 signaling (provided more than 51% of miners are signaling - else there will be a chain split.)  This will cause SegWit to activate (it only requires 95%,) and then that's it. All done. 
In the future, Core might abandon the whole BIP 9 process and just use a flag day for soft forks, which is basically the same idea as UASF.

I agree.  Guys like this (&amp; Schiff, Berwick) might have a sound grasp of economics but the way they push for whatever newsletter or investment they offer makes them suspect. The paranoia ,*hurry-up* hard sell smacks of classic scam artistry.
That said, I think the financial collapse of 2019-2020 (via the Skyscraper Theory) just *might* be the beginning of the end of central banking. A bit of metallic money would be good to have but if Bitcoin is unable to take its place as a world currency then things will likely be much worse.

Strongly suggest (since you asked) that you recommend interested new users to hold off buying until the smoke clears - which *may* be *after* the latest hard fork attempt, we'll just have to see. 
The point is, that a long position in bitcoin is a belief that it has a real future. Sure, you might make more profit buying right now (if the price doesn't actually drop,) but even if you wait to buy in at $5,000 you're going to be in a great position in 5 - 10 years.

Mining Pools would soon receive "National Security Letters" and few transactions not initiated by a KYC/AML certified wallet provider would be confirmed.

Considering this, you're right. A bail-in is more ethical than a bail-out. If an insolvent bank closes down, its depositors would get whatever remains (some percentage of their deposits.). A bail-in is effectively the same thing except the bank doesn't close. Not sure why anyone would want the bank to stay open though - it's clearly incompetent.

Possibly. As a gift or collectible. The real problem with that business model is expecting your customers to trust that you haven't kept a copy of the private key.

I don't think it's even standardized, which could be an issue.

In the long term Bitcoin actually requires full blocks.
Eventually there will be no block reward, but in less than a decade the reward will be much lower than the fee income.
Imagine if the most recent block completely emptied the mempool. There would be zero incentive to continue mining until enough transactions were available to cover the electricity cost.  The hashrate would become erratic and the system would become unstable.
In order work at that point, we would need enough of a backlog so that there's always at least a full blocks worth of fees available, even when miners get lucky and find a few blocks in quick succession.
Obviously, a mempool that grows without limit would be bad also, but by moving most daily transactions to network layers on top (which also happen to be faster, more private, and more distributed) the entire system should be able to scale as necessary.

Yes, many things are fucked up, and envy can be a problem. But you don't see a lot of tension between millionaires and billionaires just because the latter has 3 orders of magnitude more wealth than the former. Inequality itself isn't really the issue - it's the absolute level of poverty that's a problem. People stuck in poverty because the political monetary system punishes them for being thrifty, saving their money, and actively prevents them from advancing.
However, things are really much better than many claim. The percentage of the world's population living in absolute poverty (no plumbing, electricity, dirt floors, usually hungry) has decreased from 90% to 10% in the last 100 years.

No.  Existing SegWit signalers (~30%) are not signaling with bit 4. 
The 80% threshold (bit 4) will mean that 80% of the miners will begin orphaning blocks that aren't signaling for SegWit so that 100% of the blocks from them on will be signaling for SegWit (bit 1, or SegWit as Core designed it.) - meeting the 95% necessary for SegWit to activate. 
However, at that point, 80% of miners will be running code that WILL hard fork at some TBD future fixed date.
If f course, for this to work out, at least some of the miners currently signaling for SegWit will have to switch from Core to SegWit2x.

I made paper wallets using the live Linux cd (offline) from bitcoinpaperwallets.com on waterproof paper, then double laminated and stashed where I believe they'll be safe.
A properly done paper wallet is probably the most secure if you don't lose it. A Trezor would be good to, but the same - don't lose it or the key phrase you've written down.
The possible advantage of Coinbase is that you don't have to worry about 'losing' your bitcoins. You just have to worry the politicians might seize them.

SegWit will fix the long-standing transaction malleability bug, enable easy upgrades to the script system, effectively double the available transaction capacity of the system, and enable trustless, decentralized lightning payments (the only *real* scaling solution yet developed.)
SegWit will do all this as long as more than half the miners participate - the system will continue to work just fine for anyone who wants to stick with non-SegWit software. (I.e. it's a Soft Fork.)
A Hard Fork can change any existing rule - for example, it could increase the base blocksize allowing more transactions, just like SegWit. That's all the current hard fork proposals do - no other improvements.
Unfortunately, a hard fork requires *EVERYONE* to upgrade or it risks splitting the system into two incompatible networks.

There are different risks. Keeping your money in a bank (like Coinbase) could result in confiscation, or even common theft if your trusted banker turns out to be incompetent.  The most incompetent have gone out of business. Confiscation or an asset freeze is the more likely risk. 
On the other hand, keeping your money in your own wallet can result in loss if it turns out you're not fully capable of protecting your wallet.

Let's presume Bitcoin succeeds - that it becomes the world primary (or reserve) currency.
At that point, it will necessarily be far more stable than today (the price of bread or beer won't change drastically from day to day) but as the economy grows - technology and productivity - the prices of goods, *in general*, will gradually fall, which is just another way to say bitcoin will continue to become more valuable over time.
So, you ask, "Why would anyone *spend* bitcoin if it just keeps getting more valuable?"  I ask you this: will you buy bread when you're hungry even if the bread might be a little cheaper next month?  Or, how about all the folks who buy gadgets and gizmos, knowing for a fact they can get a better device at half the price next year?
A deflationary currency will discourage wasteful consumer spending (encourage savings, which is the only solution to poverty,) and discourage foolish investments, but it will not prevent people from buying what they need or want right now.

In that case they're lying. They shouldn't be signaling that they're ready to enforce SegWit2x if they're not even running SegWit2x code. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:42:52
Perhaps. Most of the hoops are in getting some Bitcoin in the first place. Using an app isn't all that hard.
It also depends on if the absence of fees allows vendors to offer lower prices. 2% fees to Amazon for an expensive, rare comic book could make the difference. I've sold on Amazon and eBay and the fees really do make it difficult.  I think etsy is probably a closer target than eBay or Amazon. The "long tail" of commerce - unique, hard-to-find, and custom products. (Like North Korean cigarettes.). I don't expect to see toothbrushes and cat food make much impact in OpenBazzar.

Bitcoin exchanges don't carry counterparty risk. They generally use some form of socialized losses.
In other words, if miners actually pulled this off there would be no 'winnings' available to collect.

Thanks!  It's coming from the US.

I think the more likely scenario is simply that people begin switching to bitcoin when bank currencies begin to *crush themselves.*
Bitcoin needs to be *ready* to serve the whole world when central banking inevitably collapses.

There are Jews who are not bankers and there are bankers who aren't Jews.
Being Jewish is neither sufficient nor necessary.  The correlation you see is merely because modern banking was invented by Jews (as loaning money was a Christian "sin,") and the simple fact that people often go into the same line of work as their parents.

Great ELI5!  The real trick of course is the routing. Bitfury published some interesting work on that recently.
I don't think the concepts involved are all that difficult to grasp. I think those who say "lightning isn't Bitcoin" are actually just refusing to understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:11:18
At the moment, it costs $1 to $2 to send a bitcoin transaction. There are some system upgrades in progress (SegWit &amp; Lightning) that should bring fees back to the 5¢ range.

I don't have any difficulty buying bitcoin at all. Of course, I'm in the US.  
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:34:04
Not if society is willing to pay more for the bitcoin than it cost to mine them.

Interesting way to put it.
In addition, with a soft fork, department managers can choose to ignore the new red tie rule. They will see every red tie as 'a tie' and consider it as valid via their rule.
With a hard fork, every manager *must* be aware of the no tie option or else they'll start disciplining employees who are actually following the new rule.

Very interesting, but *off-white* letters on a *white* background?  Really?

The first version tried to increase the base blocksize without increasing the weight limit - which would have had no effect. They really don't understand SegWit and shouldn't be messing with the code.
Especially since they expect miners to be running their code in a couple weeks.

So, are criminals using it, or is nobody using it?  Which is it?
If it's money, criminals will use it. If nobody accepts it, criminals won't want it either.

What bankers usually mean by this is a rule in writing saying 'this' or 'that' use case is explicitly legal. (Allows you to survive a lawsuit.)

I have a friend who sends money every month to Nigeria at $50 a pop (Western Union.)
I wonder if there's an easy way to convert BTC to local currency there. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:39:49
Sure. I thought you wanted to buy at market price, not for a 10% premium.

Note, purchases under $100 are unlikely at the moment. There's a temporary issue with high transaction fees. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:54:10
Almost correct. An 8MB block would be full of very unusual transactions. The typical maximum size will be around 5MB.

If there is even a *single* example of a non-Jewish banker then being Jewish is clearly not the relevant factor.

If someone thinks bitcoin is preferable to whatever else they could have made with that electricity, who are you to say they're wrong?
If no one wanted to buy bitcoin, then clearly mining them would be a waste of energy. That doesn't appear to be the case (right now.)

There's a few other SHA256D coins, but Bitcoin is the only one worth mining. With an S7 you'll make some money.
If you go with graphics cards you can mine almost everything else. Most aren't worth it, and you're often competing against botnets. But, you can use the PC and cards for other things later.

The vast majority of US dollars exist outside the country and are used by people who have no legal requirement to do so. 
In fact if (when) those people decide to send those dollars back to the US in exchange for something of value, we will see domestic hyperinflation, and we'll quickly abandon those dollars as well, taxes and rules notwithstanding.

'Ready' simply means that the SegWit capable version is ready to go - just waiting for the Bitcoin network.
I don't think any wallets are lightning ready. I believe lightning and lnd have testnet versions with routing working. Not sure about Amikopay.

If you're buying, the price is the cheapest offer currently listed on your exchange. If selling, it's the highest offer listed. 
If you want to be the one doing the 'offering', just enter a limit order. Most exchanges charge a lower fee for this.
