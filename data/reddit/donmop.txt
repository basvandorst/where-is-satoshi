Can someone clarify the differences between p2pool and regular pool? How does the p2p work?

I don't think Apple is against bitcoin, just that it is a new method to transmit money. And anytime money moving is involved, you too would want to be extra careful as not to be held accountable. Pretty sure the bitcoin market is not big enough for Apple to take such a risk.

Is it really? To me it seems like they are using bitcoin as an alternative because it has a bigger community.

Easiest? Coinbase, just link your back account.

being able to buy/use bitcoin WITHOUT internet makes bitcoin better than fiat in every single sense. That why it seemed magically.
