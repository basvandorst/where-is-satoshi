He's a proponent of Bitcoin Cash. He sold his BTC in favor of BCH. So he's not really saying Bitcoin is useless, he's just saying Bitcoin is useless without a block size increase (which is what Bitcoin Cash is).

Ordered from them once. Once.

They're tracking bitcoin addresses through the blockchain in addition to centralized exchanges. And it's only going to get more invasive. The IRS will have its pound of flesh.

I like how he's parked diagonally into the yellow no parking zone.

You're right, things were better under Obama what with the IRS/Lois Lerner illegally targeting conservative groups.
Bitcoin has and will continue to become more mainstream in at least the short-term, ergo it's being targeting for taxes via capital gains (and rightfully so).  This is not much different than starting to legalize marijuana, i.e., it's all about **taxing** it. That, like Bitcoin, will only continue to go more mainstream because it's about revenue.
Do you really think if your candidate had won there would have been any difference other than potential timelines? And that your candidate and their party would be going after entities in The Paradise Papers? Which BTW, just because "wealth is being hidden from taxable laws", that doesn't mean it's illegal. It's a wealth management strategy for individuals and corporations, laws that are written and passed by both parties. I don't know if anything *illegal* has been brought to light by The Paradise Papers as I don't study it.

"This administration" hasn't even been in office for a year. Can you cite  Trump's administration ordering this action by the IRS?

Close, but no.

"The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who's Who of Goldman Sachs graduates."
