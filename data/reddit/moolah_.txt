Some members of the community think that I'm in this for a profit, and at the end of the day, I'm really not. I want to make it easier for people to use digital currencies. I want to make it easier for people to do good with digital currencies.
Both myself and my partner regularly work with charities (we have a particular affinity towards those that deal with mental health issues, a greatly underfunded area), and I believe that every company has an obligation to do their part too. A percentage of our profits are given to good causes, and I founded Moofund primarily because I thought the world could do better in terms of fundraising.
So, think what you want of me, but don't let it prevent you from helping others that need it. I firmly subscribe to the opinion that if you can help others, you should.
**Help the Homeless**
We want to help the homeless and support them (and the shelters and charities that work with them) with housing, healthcare, education and much needed supplies. Let's show the world that we can make an impact in a big way.
There have been campaigns to raise funds in various currencies before, but we're aiming to change the way the world raises money - by allowing people to donate however they want. Digital currencies can do so much good if we just band together. At the end of the day, no matter which particular coin we support, we still support the ideals that these coins stand for.
We don't believe that we should restrict people to a single currency to protect a brand or make a profit, if there is a small chance that even a single person will be forsaken and go hungry on the streets... shouldn't we band together and do whatever it takes to prevent that from happening?
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang. Let's make the world a better place.

Absolutely no precise reason. Moving stuff out of Paypal for the first time since we opened the account.


To the general public, and community. That is correct. What we offer to our existing investors is our own business however, we had no pressing need to inform external third parties of our plans in this area.


It is an ongoing round that we are in no rush to complete, to bulk up reserves and mitigate ongoing operational costs.


We are not soliciting funds via email, I am unsure as to why you think this. Perhaps your latest "source" is confused, we have used a private subreddit for this.
See, I am aware of who each and every investor is; and while I may not speak to each and every one of them - I do speak to a considerable number of them. For the most part, they're pretty happy.
We have received no investment refund requests (I do not know whether we would or would not honor such a request, generally speaking, investments do not get "refunded" - you're not buying a toaster) bar two in the past, which were acted on promptly.
We have continued to pay dividends, based on a percentage of our profits, month on month. So months have been good, some have been bad. That cycle will continue.

We very rarely send out checks, for this very reason. Have you been offered a fee-free domestic transfer? Everybody who requests a check has been offered one. We try to avoid checks like the plague to avoid situations exactly like this, and we also do not send them daily (they are batched out each week).
A resend of the check was approved, and it will be with you shortly. Your money has not been held hostage, and we use multiple people on one ticket to provide 24/7 coverage with varying shift patterns.
I have requested that the support team keep me updated with your case, and I have asked our COO (who sends the checks out) to let me know as soon as it is done. If there is anything I can do in order to improve your opinion of us, please let me know.

Because I've just moved house and was unaware of any Paypal dispute, I don't login to the account on a constant basis - and we use the IPN for fulfilment.

I would like to clear some of your points up in order to ensure that the general public isn't confused by your statements.


By all the laws of the United Kingdom, I would like to publicly state that my name is legally Alex Green. I personally incorporated Moopay LTD in the United Kingdom after we decided to not pursue incorporation within Switzerland. I am unsure as to how I can make that clearer.


We do not have a nominee director with Moopay LTD, only myself. With our US incorporation, we have Landon Merrill.


I am not in the habit of providing copies of my identification to people I am not legally bound to provide them to. In hindsight, I am glad I stuck to this mentality given how the people involved have appeared to react. I cannot even imagine what they would have done by now, but I cannot imagine that it would be good.
I would recommend to everybody in this thread, that you never provide a copy of your identification to somebody unless it is legally required. If your ID is required for AML/KYC checks, look in to the company first. Are they incorporated, are they 4 days old, etc. Identity theft is a fairly serious issue in this day and age.
@_date: 2014-05-19 09:18:34

I am assuming you do not want to pay for the registration paperwork? It only costs a pittance. My name is all over it, and it is publicly available. If you're not willing to buy the documentation, I'll link you to one of **God knows how many sites** that collate it and make it available to the general public. This is the same information that appears on the registration paperwork, **with my name**.
There you go, now stay true to your word and stop spreading your FUD ;-). Or at least stop harassing a rather large number of people in PM by accusing them of working for us, or being shills, or being outright creepy.

He has not bought a toaster. He cannot take a product back and ask for a refund. I think you'll find very few investments, if any, where you can go "*OI I CHANGED MY MIND*".
For example, if you change your mind with a public investment - your only way to get money back is to sell that investment back to the market.
I have offered to buy the investment of this particular investor back, and I am sure that even if I hadn't, many other people would be interested. There are many, many people who have a considerable amount of faith in us.

All operational costs are covered by Moopay LTD, including two full-time staff members. Our third staff member is a full-time volunteer.
We were previously responsible for managing the DOGE4NASCAR initiative, as well as a number of smaller ones. The funds will be released where they can do the most good, we are actively reaching out to homeless shelters in this regard.
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:49:44
Can I ask why you feel this way?
We have had money sat in Paypal for quite some time, tied to a bank account in the United Kingdom that we could withdraw to in less than 2 hours. The vast majority of our assets are kept in digital currency however, and we tend to keep it that way.
With the migration to V2, we're now cleaning things up. No rush on anything.

I do not think you understand what a logo is.
So people are aware, this was a small font-size: 11px; string in the bottom right of the page, out of site. Not a logo, not a big bit of branding.

@_date: 2014-07-13 01:41:53


The book has a single outgoing monthly payment, to an operational expense labelled "PIE".
We then divvy it up accordingly, and log all details of the individual payments - but for the sake of general accounting, it's a single outgoing payment.
We're working on improved accounting, the books would be confusing enough without this.


This is true, however - we greatly undervalued the company, and part of me wonders whether it would have been better to accept traditional investment and the red tape that involves. We have raised far less money than other businesses in this space, but have more autonomy and freedom.


Profit is a rolling calculation, in the sense that if we go in to the red by 5K, we'd have to make 6K to take us up to 1K profit. On that profit, we would pay out the £150.


They are provided with profit / revenue information on a monthly basis. We had rough projections in the beginning that were provided when asked.


I am more than happy to respond to most people, though I am avoiding being dragged in to flame wars with trolls; which is a mistake I have made in the past.
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:17:02
We have continued to pay dividends on a regular basis, our platform remains active.
I would appreciate you not scaring this particular investor without any evidence to backup your statement.
I do however also subscribe to the "more than you can afford to lose" belief, because while you shouldn't live in a bubble, some risks can be mitigated.
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:31:41
We were simply looking to cut a step out, people are blowing this way out of proportion :-).
@_date: 2014-05-28 23:59:14
Their stories were based upon factually accurate evidence - there was no burden of proof. There is the key difference between a true journalist, and somebody like you. You make false assumptions and invent facts to back them up.
I don't control moderators anywhere, so take off your tinfoil hat and stop spouting bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:58:41
Again, out of context; with none of the communications surrounding it.
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:58:44
Not in a rush, looking to cut out some hassle - here is how it looks.
Our Paypal account is attached to Moopay LTD, and based in the United Kingdom - with a British bank account attached.
The majority of our company funds, along with all exchange/customer funds, are in an account in the United States.
Our US account has nothing but problems with international transfers. Sadly, only a credit union was willing to work with us due to Wells Fargo doing a complete 180 on us after 2 months (despite us having paperwork from management stating that everything was fine), and they're not even fully connected to the SWIFT network.
It is nothing about speed, it is nothing about being in a rush. It's about avoiding the headache that I can already feel happening.
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:48:49
At no point have we said or indicated that we are in any kind of a hurry. I like cutting steps out in order to make things simpler.
The Paypal funds have been sat there for some time, we could have them in a bank account in less than 2 hours, but they would just be sat there. Eventually, they would be converted to digital currency - and having thought about it, would like to get some more coins at the current price.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:23:19
Again, all I can do is apologise. This withdrawal request was approved for a fee-free wire when there were check issues roughly 20 minutes after you provided your account details to us.
Who do you bank with? If they are a large bank (as in, will have branches in Portland or... I'm not sure on other staff locations, but we have a few of 'em), I will have a staff member personally walk the cash in and deposit in person immediately. If not, I will have it processed online as soon as Landon is back home (he is skipping the gym and coming straight back, I just got in touch with him). The money should be in your account within 2 days.
If there is anything I can do in order to improve your impression of us, you need only let me know. We have a process for deposits/withdrawals that works fairly smoothly, but our new banking partner has been a bit useless with international withdrawals (there is one we filled in the paperwork for 10 days ago, no account activity in regards to it; Landon will be yelling at a manger today). US withdrawals have been pretty snappy since we got access to direct payments, but I am honestly not sure how you fell through any gaps.
As the CEO of the company, the buck stops with me; I'm sorry we dropped the ball on this one.
**Edit:** Not sure why somebody down voted your comment, it was pretty fair (I've upvoted it).
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:44:59
We upped the prototype count because of early interest. Only 14 were actually sold in the end.
14 x 550 = $7,700.

No, not our enrolment number.
When you register, and when you are finally approved, you get a number known as a BSA ID. This is the number you are referring to.
We have only just received it, after sitting around and waiting for quite some time. Their search platform does not update in real-time, so you will need to wait for them to update before searching, this is every Friday - but I am unsure if it will be in this update (2 days away), or the next one.
The SEC takes **months** to issue formal confirmations, I thought you knew that? We have a lawyer, we just don't parade him around in public... because that would be pointless?
Please feel free to continue your time by obsessing over me.

The video is missing a considerable amount of context in the form of email and text based communication. You are welcome to infer as you wish from it, but I would encourage you to keep an open mind.
Our primary platform has been working solidly for 7 months, and barring one major issue which happened last night (and has already been fixed), has had pretty smooth sailing.
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:29:03
You are a joke and a waste of time. You have proved nothing. I suggest you look up the concept of self - promotion versus stating who the funds are managed by (which was a public request).
Back on my block list you go, enjoy wasting your time instead of making yourself useful.
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:19:18
Engaging with you further is pointless. You are simply yet another sock puppet obsessed with myself, my company and my employees.
I would advise that you seek the advice of a professional in regards to this obsession, it cannot be healthy (and I mean that). Looking through your post history, you seem like a very angry person that could possibly benefit through talking it out with somebody.
I will not be replying to your further, on any matters, as I have concerns for your state of mind at this stage.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:11:30
Okay! Your check withdrawal request was approved, and I am unsure as to why it was not sent (it was listed as pending for some time); I have requested clarification as to why. You were asked if you would prefer a fee-free domestic transfer, to which you said yes. This was confirmed and approved by me the same day, and passed over to our COO (Landon Merrill) for processing.
I am trying to make sense of online banking now (I am not responsible for the payouts, so I have minimal interaction with our US account - and it has a horrible online banking implementation) to see whether the transfer was issued, and if not; why not. I am attempting to call Landon now to get an immediate follow-up and resolution to this, and I can only deeply apologise for the delay you have incurred.
I am aware that there are a few delays with international based withdrawals, but domestic withdrawals should be processing rapidly, and then in your account within 2 days. Again, I am extremely sorry for this.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:40:09


I would like to buy you a dictionary, may I ask where you would like it sent? Are you actually able to read?


Absolutely wrong. People have. Both personal and business, as has more than one official body in the United Kingdom. Something about due diligence requirements in the United Kingdom for any sort of registered office or forwarding service. Something about requirements for bank accounts. Something about people actually meeting me, on several occasions.


Right, this is called defamation. You cannot defame somebody because they are "most likely" (in your misguided opinion) doing something wrong. More importantly, your split personalities and various alt accounts do not count as other people. I'll be quite honest, the people in do not give a damn about your opinion. Neither do our **80,000+ registered users**. Our investors also certainly don't give a damn about what you're spouting either.
See, there's a rule in the subreddit preventing FUD. Whatever you're putting together better be entirely factual (and this means not opinion based "*most likely*"), or it will just be removed (I expect, based on the current ruleset). More importantly, defamation is not allowed in the eyes of the law, and if you continue to make a fool of yourself; then I hope you are prepared to deal with the resulting consequences.


Do you suddenly have access to internal financial workings? No, no you do not. It would not mean that at all, it would mean that you are trying to twist things to suit your opinion, which is hilarious at best.


This made me laugh. I'll be quite blunt, nobody gives a flying fuck about the extortion racket that comprises the BBB.
We have a proven and working platform. A solid consumer service, a solid merchant service - and we don't really get complaints about either. Feel free to continue wasting your time by obsessing over me, however.
I look forward to what I expect to be a hilarious response.

I am the sole director, and have been the only one listed from the start. Anything and everything has had to go through me. I am not the only listed shareholder, but I do not remember them asking for proof of identity for the other shareholders (they were below 25% each).
As said, I am happy to provide proof of official HMRC correspondence addressed to the registered office; which negates your last point.


We used a fairly major provider, one of the larger ones in fact. They seem fairly above board, and were pretty thorough in their due diligence.

Would you mind providing proof of our insolvency? People do not have issues in withdrawing funds from our consumer and merchant platforms (and we deal with stuck coin issues on the exchange platform as they occur). The title of your post is patently false and outright defamatory.
We have previously provided proof of reserves to the general public, on two occasions. We do not have to prove you wrong, you have to prove that we are insolvent. The burden of proof is on you on this occasion.
If you are incapable of doing this, may I ask why you are spreading FUD? You seem to think that an edited video with minimal context constitutes something, when it does not. If you are capable of proving it, by all means, go ahead.

The video is the end of a long chain of communication, at which point we had given up on trying to work with them. Being threatened if I don't provide somebody my personal property records, is not something I take kindly to.
This started when we announced to a couple of members in private that we were forming a non-profit fundraising platform. One person seemed to take this as "we're going to compete with the foundation", which is nothing short of ridiculous.
Their legitimate concerns had been repeatedly addressed, and after a certain amount of time, answering the same questions in a loop with the goal posts being moved is nothing short of exhausting.

IBAN is for European accounts. Most accounts in the UK also do not allow you to send internationally from your online dashboard.

I give vague responses to known trolls.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:43:27
I have switched to my laptop, and feel that these points might be clearer for you to understand.
1. We do not offer guaranteed payouts. They are purely based on profit percentages. We do not take money from our customers (aside from fees). Merchants use us... and we give them money. Traders use us... and well, again. How exactly are we a ponzi scheme? We primarily make it easy for merchants to accept digital currencies and receive local payouts in FIAT across a wide range of coins, and also provide a high speed trading engine working towards full compliance. I am not sure that you entirely understand what our platform is, and what it does.
3. We have been actively in touch with the roughly dozen (slightly over) people who ordered an ATM prototype regarding the fact we completely changed the platform. We offered refunds to anybody who wanted one, **and not a single person took us up on that**. We have in the past week changed from an ARM platform to an x86 NUC based platform due to better support for drivers on the bill validators we are using (the NV range from Innovative Technology). We have been public on Twitter about this, and it seems that getting a new case specced out and fabricated at short notice is a bit of a nightmare. All of the components are hooked up and ready to go (as per the images), we have redone the UI in the extra time (as per the images) - and **the sole thing remaining** is a new case.
3. Are you intending to make a post about each and every digital currency company that raises funds? You know multiple have **raised millions** in the past couple of months? Our fundraising rounds have been for too small amounts, if anything.
4. Why are some moderators missing from your post? Do you have a grudge against them?
5. Again, exactly where are we promoted as an official face of dogecoin? We are not. The community trusts and vouch for us because **we provide a service that they actively use** on a daily basis.
6. You are welcome to meet our Chief of Operations (Landon Merrill), our Head of Customer Support (Alex Hatzenbuhler) and our new Fundraising Agent (Kevin Dusenberry, being moved from a CSA role) at Inside Bitcoins in New York City in just a few days, where we are exhibiting (where we also have meetings scheduled on either side with some big players).
7. We are not a one man company. We have a number of stakeholders who are publicly disclosed. We are an 11 person team and things are going great for us, we are moving the physical operation to Ireland and a number of staff are relocating there. You seem to have a problem with myself directly though.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:34:06
I'm not in the United States, I was unsure if it was a large bank (I know the big names, WF, BofA, etc). It seems to be fairly restricted in terms of the amount of branches it has, so I doubt we'll be able to get somebody to walk in; but I will get our COO to check.
@_date: 2014-05-19 09:17:11

I've had Cryptsy take 61 hours, I think that's my record for a withdrawal. Now, moving on as to why this is taking a while - it's called fraud prevention and risk mitigation (in relation to manual approvals). I assume as a platform owner you understand how this works?

Over 80,000 registered users. Actual volume of complaints is extremely low; I have responded to this user in the other thread he just created.
Our biggest issue has been tickets being incorrectly assigned, or incomplete information being passed over (which results in additional delays).

May I ask what promises have been made that were not fulfilled? Our services are live and active.
Our ATM units are going out on schedule, I am unaware of any users emailing in regards to a delay (I am assuming you are not a customer).
We have a rather large amount of happy customers on our platform, so we must be doing something right.
I'm sorry that you feel that way that you do, but there will always be people who cry "scam" with no actual evidence or proof.

If in one month our revenue dropped sharply, or costs increased so much that there were no profits - then there would be no payouts that month.

Please don't lie in your post. We did not raise $27,000 for ATM units, nor was it an investment round. You are not a customer, and you have no idea of any communications in relation to it. We have kept people up to date.
Many new members do not view us as an official face of Dogecoin - though the community certainly vouches for us, as they are happy with our services.
My team has been told to actively ignore you, and I will be doing the same. I am personally known to people, but you do not value their opinion. Your constant refusal to not post on an alt account is rather suspicious.
You may claim a ponzi scheme, but there are no guaranteed payouts - it is based on profits from across our entire platform. Our platform that is well known, well used and **running smoothly**. I do not think you understand the concept of a ponzi scheme. Similar platforms to us have raised millions in funding recently, I do believe we raised the least? Our investors seem very happy with us though :-).

1. Delays happen. We have clearly addressed them. One product out of **many working services**.
2. If people post about us, they post about us. The vast majority of people posting about us are **fairly old accounts**, as opposed to the same alt account that keeps popping up again and again with a "1 day old account".
3. This is utter bullshit, stop wasting my time.
4. I don't think you understand how revenue and fee structures work, along with monthly residuals. Our employees do not go unpaid, this is utter bullshit. We have one bounty that was not paid as the **plugin was deemed not eligible**. We also don't sell t-shirts, we provided payment processing for represent.com who sold t-shirts on behalf of Phil Parson's Racing... the funds from which went straight to fund another DOGECAR outing.
5. Our exchange is not our primary service, and we are considering fully shifting the current model it has in to an instant buy/sell platform. Many options are on the table. I was working constantly in order to secure issues with the ATM's, issues that were addressed and allowed us to set a new shipping date.
6. I'm opposed to third-party audits? Again, utter bullshit.
PIE information is not kept from public view, we have an internal forum for people who invested, that's it. Your SEC comments are utter bullshit, I am sick and tired of wasting my time pointing out numerous exemption clauses based on our business operations. You might find hosted mining a sham, many people do not. We have a fundraising platform, and for charities and NPO's we waive **all associated fees**, zero profit. And finally, we do not sell t-shirts - at this stage you're outright lying.
Are you a troll? You do the math.

I am willing to pay for the convenience of minimum hassle.
It would cost us $37.66 for the outgoing wire, it would cost us $40 to receive it. With our credit union, it has historically taken us roughly 9 working days to be credited for an incoming wire payment (which is why we suspended international deposits and have been looking for an alternative banking partner).
So we're currently at $77.66, 9 working days, 1% on Coinbase fees, and then 3 - 5 working days waiting on Coinbase to deliver.
We have minimal money on the UK side of the operation, but when we want to get it over to the US - it is a nightmare.

When somebody sends you equipment that either fails to even boot up, or outright throws sparks in your face, there is a rather large problem. Our immediate reaction was to offer refunds to affected parties, but after internal discussions - decided to compensate affected parties. This is called **good customer service**. The Blades have turned out to be a joke overall in terms of their ability to actually work. The mini seeds however have all been pretty damn solid :-).
A larger issue following on from this has been our primary supplier not responding to enquiries or providing a return address to send DOA units. I have now personally reached out to the manager of the company in question (manages vAsic, my involvement is generally not needed) in order to get this resolved.
As a result of this; and in an attempt to prevent this from happening, we are now looking to work directly with the manufacturers, as opposed to third party distributors.


Precisely. This is a result of testing, units have been shown to become rapidly unstable **and dangerous**.


We have made a loss on the initial 14 units, this is correct. Most places make far larger losses on prototypes.


We have actually not made a loss on the business, sorry to say.


Actually, 4 of the team are competent developers if required (this number includes &gt;pays huge legal fees to make sure his business is top notch

They are not formal equity owning stakeholders. For the sake of simplicity, they are referred to as investors.
People who bought in to the pie, were provided with a GPG / digitally signed proof of entitlement agreement that outlined how much they put in, what percentage of the profits they are entitled to, etc. We have continued to pay out a percentage of our profits, month on month, to people holding these documents. There are no profit guarantees, it is purely percentage based. A profit of zero in one month would equal a payout of zero.
One major mistake I made in round 1, was not setting a minimum investment cap - which led to a deluge of micro-investors; of which management has been a nightmare.

* ATM units currently represent $6,600 worth of infusion. Less than the single Paypal transfer that this thread references. Since we took our first order, we have guaranteed to honor any refund request. We know that we greatly dropped the ball on these units, and have said so.
* PIE rounds currently represent 750 BTC worth of infusion.
* The private investor round is ongoing, and represents roughly 90 BTC worth of infusion.
* Most resales of pie are not done anonymously, very few are.
* What would you like, pictures of 14 Zeus Thunder rigs? I cannot take pictures of the KnC equipment as it has yet to arrive. Happy to take pictures on the Zeus side of the equation, had another 8 units just arrive.
* I am not sure why you consider this a "cash" infusion. It is an equivalent trade.
So, in terms of actual infusion in to Moolah - the 750 BTC was worth roughly $340,000... plus $6,600 (which did not cover components)... let's round it up and call it $350,000.
Now take a look at what other companies in our space have raised, and then look at how a number of them have lacking feature sets when compared to what we are **currently offering**.

Normally I would ignore you (as a known troll with a penchant for spreading misinformation), but for the benefit of the general public; I will be responding to this post.
In regards to your first point, unlike you - Wells Fargo was fully aware of our timeline and filing policies in regards to MTL, having been provided with that information by the legal counsel who was (and still is) assisting us with this policy. We are within all grace periods currently, and work is still ongoing.
In regards to your second point, following advice from legal counsel, as well as a preliminary enquiry to the SEC on two occasions - we are currently not in breach of any known securities regulations. As they are taking a considerable amount of time in regards to confirming our exemption (FYI: we have actually filed paperwork in regards to this), we have reached out to additional legal counsel, and the SEC again; on whether there is any additional paperwork that we should file purely as a cautionary measure.
We've been going 7 months strong, and we will be going for a lot longer. Sorry to disappoint, but we're in this for the long run; despite your best wishes.
