SegWit is going to make Bitcoin a universal currency? Wow. I missed the memo on that one. That would sure be great. Ok?
@_date: 2016-09-24 16:20:05
The people who are destroying Bitcoin are responsible for this: 
They are also responsible for turning Bitcoin into a settlement system banks say they want (but in truth don't) vs. a payment system people want. They are responsible for promoting complicated solutions to simple problems, and marketing unproven technologies as ways to resolve easily addressable configuration issues. These people are responsible for making Bitcoin unpredictable and expensive. The one good enhancement to the Bitcoin protocol under their watch was already under development before they received their first round of funding. Everything else has been done to benefit their schemes, and not take care of Bitcoin the electronic cash system. 
The guy in this podcast is going over old concepts and a Bitcoin 101 from years ago.

Yeah, but we aren't designing Bitcoin today. We are building from a moderately mature protocol that isn't easy to change. 
It troubles me that our developers are waxing poetic about what they would have done differently when there is a capacity log jam we are deprioritizing and ignoring right now.
If it's proposed to split the wallet from the node functionality as a roadmap effort before we increase the block size, I'm going to freaking scream.
@_date: 2016-09-28 19:09:01
Ok, by the numbers.
False statement 


[The average transactions in a block are ~ 1,300 based on the the last several months.](
The block target is 10 minutes, but the average block solution time is more like 9.2 minutes because of hash rate improvements towards the end of each 2,016 block readjustment cycle.
That is 2.17 transactions per second at 10 minutes, and 2.4 transactions per second at 9 minutes. The 2.3 transactions per second figure is demonstrably real, as I've just shown using historical data that can be independently verified.
You are falsely inflating the transactions per block by 50% by saying that there are 3.33 transactions per second.
False statement 


SegWit will increase capacity by 1.6x based on the types of transactions seen in blocks today. 2.3 x 1.6 = 3.68 transactions per second, not 6. You are claiming that SegWit will create a 2.6x capacity gain, which is nearly 3x larger than what we will see based on current transaction types.
SegWit will create a 60% capacity increase as soon as the entire Bitcoin ecosystem changes their software and supports it, a process that could take a long time. Some may never support it because of the soft forked economic changes that no one voted on but the developers working on the code (discount on fees for SegWit transactions).
Please be more careful throwing around bullshit numbers. It makes you look incompetent, intellectually dishonest, or both.

And PayPal wasn't super easy for the first few years until it became big enough to regulate, just like the way the routing logic will encourage hubs to get big with LN, leading to the same problems encountered by PayPal and a regulated Bitcoin network /s
There is no way I'm down with LN with the routing logic proposed on git today. Those with large quantities of BTC will become hubs, which will effectively become banks, and what happens to banks? They are big enough to regulate. 
Good bye frictionless cryptocurrency system. LN has weak routing logic. It's a no-go right now as a general payment routing system. Great for specialized use case like user custody exchanges, perhaps.

Do you not understand that paying more in fees doesn't increase the number of transactions that Bitcoin can handle when we limit blocks to 1MB, or around 1,200 transactions per block on average?
Around 1,200 transactions fit in a block. Paying enough BTC for a $10.00 fee doesn't change that fact. 
Right now there is a very consistent backlog of transactions. That is limiting the supply of transactions that will fit into Bitcoin.
This means users and businesses are not using Bitcoin in lieu of other options, like alt-coins, credit cards, banks, etc.

You are the one who brought price up as a reason why capping growth is ok, not me. Now you are going to say that price doesn't count when it is used to defeat the same argument you used?


BTC broke 1,100 and nearly hit 1,200 in Dec. 2013. You are playing chart games with the timeframe by saying we are 30% higher than exactly two years ago.
Look at the data on coindesk. It's a spreadsheet.




It's not logic. It's charts and verifiable information. Blockstream has misrepresented scaling with 2,4,8, then 2mb, then nothing. What they've actually done is put in SegWit, which soft forks economic incentives to make lightning network transactions cheaper than they should be, and work on projects like RBF opt-in, that are sold under one set of features, but really just enable a long term roadmap for controlled L2 layers that are completely unproven in production.
The one good thing they did was speed up syncing, but that was in the works before they raised their first $21m. So far, they've been neglecting immediate needs for projects that benefit their long term objectives, which are directly aligned with their own profitability with no consideration for anyone else.
And that's exactly what they should do. They are a for profit company. They actually have a fiduciary responsibility to act that way.
The problem is, their business model coopts an open source p2p network. See PGP developer privatization.

Storj and Maidsafe have been working on sharded, distributed database tech. for a while now, and it's still not ready for primetime. In an ideal world I could instantly teleport anywhere and move objects with my mind. We don't live in an ideal world. 
You justify rate limiting Bitcoin for fear of it getting to big so that it is attacked by state actors. Do you think there is some kind of magical market cap. amount after which the NSA and MI5 will say "welp, gents, that's it. Bitcoin just crossed the line. Time to take it down!" Again, if you believe that, you live in a fantasy world. The sick irony is your proposal to continue to limit Bitcoin's growth and avoid these mysterious "state actors" simply makes YOU the state actor! You are LITERALLY planning monetary policy right now by capping throughput! The entire point of Bitcoin is to have no Central bank, yet here we are listening to your remarks on keeping interest rates unchanged, or maybe increasing them to "cool off" the economy! Do you not see the deep hypocrisy of this statement?
It is not your call whether Bitcoin should be a store of value with hypothetical layers on top of it to provide transaction volume. The project NEVER had that in the goals and objectives. The goal was to increase volume and use advances in hardware and optimizations to keep the scaling native, not to rate limit Bitcoin and build fictional "L2 networks" on top of it.
There is no functional L2 network. It's a giant fiction. Show me a working lightning network that doesn't centralize routing and create banks?
Your post is a dogmatic horse-pucky. It belongs in the trash. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:30:27
Yet you think it's ok to put Bitcoin's growth on hold so we can wait for another technology that doesn't exist when we have solutions that work just fine without vaporware, and actually make Bitcoin more energy efficient per transaction? Hard drives are already 4x cheaper than when we capped Bitcoin in 2010, yet we still have the 2010 cap. 
The SigOp and Sighash restrictions in BIP109 resolve the edge case of giant transactions. What's being done to Bitcoin by leaving the cap at 1MB at this stage of its growth is vandalism.

Is that what your investor updates tell you each month?
LN was supposed to be live this summer. 
LN will NOT be "online" (defined as usable broadly by anyone on Bitcoin mainnet) by October 1st, 2017. Not without putting the network at grave risk, anyway. If I were to be incredibly optimistic and wear several sets of rose color glasses, I would guess it will be at least 2 years from widespread adoption of SegWit before we see LN, and that's being generous.
I don't believe LN as currently conceived will ever be "online". The routing logic proposed in github has more holes in it than a block of old swiss cheese.

That's not honest. Around 100,000 people (0.0014% of the adult population) can be very active users of the network when it is rate limited to 2.3 transactions per second. So, technically, if they are part of the 0.0014% that can actively use it without it overflowing, fees going through the roof, and confirmation times taking hour and hours unpredictably, they can send funds anywhere in the world with no counter party risk or government interference, right?
Just keeping it real.

That chart won't load...
[Just leave this page open as a tab in your browser.](
It shows the count of unconfirmed transactions in the tab without having to look at it. 
On average, around 1,200 transactions fit in a block (2.3 TPS).
Divide whatever you see in the unconfirmed transaction count by 1,200 and you can envelope the unconfirmed transaction count at any given moment.
Right now it's 5,340, or 4.5 blocks of transactions sitting in queue.
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:40:55
[Look at the median block size over the last 90 days.]( The network cannot handle more capacity. 
Why do you think Bitcoin has value? Because people mine it to increase security? It has value because it's a useful form of p2p electronic value that is secure and runs without intermediaries.
If you take the usefulness out of it by limiting the number of people and companies that may use it, you are capping its utility. The feedback loop of mining and price will continue because of price speculation, but in the end the market will balance out at a fair price for the utility of the network.
Capping throughput means no new developers will become interested, and VC money will go elsewhere. That's already happened. Please, your argument is about as thin as it can be. It's clear you have a stake in one of these L2 gambles and will say absolutely anything to justify the destructive actions of the current roadmap for Bitcoin.

Great video. The bus analogy is perfect. 
I think the argument of how much a standard PC could handle computationally is great, but it's missing a critical piece; we need to plan for the capacity requirements for storing the blockchain.
I think we need to define a minimum system requirements standard for running a full node. This should include:
* Hardware &amp; OS requirements (CPU, Memory, Disk Space, OS)
* Broadband requirements (minimum up/down speed, uptime - based on constant and peak Bitcoin network communication requirements, assuming Xthin or otherwise)
Target for the hardware/software should be a barebones performance PC, similar to those used for gaming, with a mid-level broadband connection. Then apply conservative scaling to this as speed improves. 40% annually is conservative across storage, processing power, and broadband. Right now, that's a 3.4Ghz Intel CPU, 16 GB memory, and a 2 TB hard drive. That's a heck of a lot more storage than was standard in 2010, when we put the limit on max_block_size. 128 GB SSD's were common then. Now we're nearly 20x this in terms of storage capacity. 
Seems like BIP101's scaling has it right to me. Flexcap is creates a variable where BIP101 creates a known value. This increases unpredictable capacity, confirmation times, and fees. 
BIP101 is something you can plan around.
Now the concerns around full node costs are mitigated, and we can scale Bitcoin until the improvements in hardware and connectivity we've seen consistently over the last 40+ years diverge from the long term trend.
Great video, but address capacity. Also, I would go after the "giant 1MB transaction" FUD directly and address this as well.

Can you elaborate on "privacy" and what development work is possible to improve it, the level of difficulty, and why that is a priority over scaling?
There have been plenty of polls and scaling is clearly the 'low hanging fruit'. It is addressable with simple changes. Privacy is not easily addressable, unless you want to change the way it works to more of a ring signature model or zero knowledge proofs. These types of changes will never happen, because the changes are too radical.

Step 1: read about how to create a secure local wallet.
Step 2: read again, and try it a few times, including funding it with test amounts
Step 3) Set up wallet, or skip 1 and 2 and buy a trezor and set that up (store the key phrase)
Step 4: Set up an account on one exchange that accepts ACH, fund it to your daily limit
Step 5: Fund your daily limit and buy that amount every day, move the bitcoin you bought off to your own wallet as soon as it clears
Step 6: You don't really think I'm going to tell you how to launder money on reddit, do you?
The two things I'll say, 1) you should be careful, because even though most exchanges limit you to smaller daily amounts, if you structure transactions in smaller amounts to avoid reporting limits at $2 (SAR), $3 (BSA), or $10k (CTR) levels, that's suspicious activity to law enforcement and 2) exchanges aren't safe, so don't leave money on them. Get the BTC out into a wallet you control in step 3, and keep at last two copies of your backup safe.

Look at the price from Dec. 2013, down 50%. We are going on two years below our previous high.
The issue is that Bitcoin is being mismanaged against the wishes of the majority of users. Announce scaling to 2MB or better yet 8MB doubling every two years and watch what happens to the price.


Wrong. This data is available too. Investment in 2016 is less than 1/2 of what it was in 2015. If you remove Circle (tbd), DAH ("permissioned ledgers" lol), and Blockstream (deathstar), it's 10% of last year. That means all the innovative startups are going to die in 2017 when they run out of money. Largely because they can't get new users because of the roadmap decisions of people who have an ownership stake or collect paychecks from Blockstream.

Hmm. [Have you read the most recent logic around routing?](
Am I missing something in the github about how all of this works? Frankly, this seems to not be anywhere close to far enough along where you could know that the interface will be the same.
Users care about speed, reliability, and cost. Without the routing logic fully baked and working, I don't see how any of that can be known. The routing logic seems to favor larger hubs as well, which creates regulatory concerns. Based on what I'm seeing in the github, there is a very real concern that LN is going to create economic incentives for hubs to become bigger and bigger until they can be regulated just like banks. 
That makes perfect sense for exchanges with user custody, or similar businesses using LN, but it doesn't make sense as a general L2 payment routing protocol. Please dispel these concerns if I'm missing something.

Answer is: yes.
Next question: aren't the groups willing to publicly commit the most BTC to nodes in order to make them efficient also making themselves known publicly?
Answer: they could conceal themselves, but if they were a really big hub, we could figure out their identity and location with a direct and concerted effort.
Next question: if we can identify and locate the big hubs that are most efficient and control most of the principal flow through the L2 network, will large regulatory bodies approach these hubs and regulate them?

Yeah. Lightning Networks. Totally thought through and legit. Fix the routing logic please.

3 blocks on a slow day. Personally, I waited way more than 10 blocks with a very high fee on Friday. The UT count was 14k-15k for hours and hours.
Do you think this is healthy for the Bitcoin network to not only have payments wait for one random walk of 9-10 min. on average, but now 3+ random walks? 
Bitcoin is now more expensive than ACH, and ACH is moving to 3x a day settlement, so our settlement cycles will be similar too.

There's nothing outside of China operating on a scale that serves as a check and balance on that centralization. Two possibilities. 1) Firms mining there with no meaningful scale are either poorly run or hobby businesses, or 2) the farms in China are running below cost, and it will take someone with deep pockets to survive long enough to compete with them outside of China. If any of that imbalance is caused by the currency controls in China, it may take a very long time... unless the miners in WA are smart and creative and find a way to give themselves the same advantages. They can't compete in one area, that's if corrupt officials are giving free power. Everything else is possible. They definitely need to get a direct line into fabrication plants creating the ASICs!

Not true. There's a concept of "block acceptance depth" after which nodes ignore their max block size settings and go with the longest chain.

No, that's not my point. My point is that the companies marketing DPL have very little or nothing to lose by following it.
This is not because they are "better" or less "offensive". It's because the companies marketing DPL already have a defacto monopoly anyway, and don't lose anything by observing DPL.
Let's see these same companies release a product that doesn't rely on a Bitcoin development monopoly to be competitive, and then see them give up all of their trade secrets and IP under DPL.
Their shareholders would file suit against the company's management if that happened. This is a calculated marketing stunt. Stop pretending otherwise.

I didn't say it was a business. It's a defacto monopoly over Bitcoin, measured in terms of paid employee/contractor commits to the repo, and also work done on future enhancements. Is this a serious question?


Ok, that's a non-sequitur. You either didn't understand or are otherwise misinterpreting what I wrote.

If usage outgrew capacity in general, new users would stop using Bitcoin because of the unpredictable and often high fees, unpredictable confirmation timing, and poor user experience.
An equilibrium point would be reached where the "suck" factor of Bitcoin crosses the line of "worth it", and users instead will use another cryptocurrency, bank transfer, or credit card product.
This is exactly what is happening. See the title of this thread for an example.

It's a matter of degree. 8MB blocks allow 8x more capacity and 8x more users on Bitcoin today. That's a pretty damn big improvement. Imagine 8x the number of interested people, 8x the talented developers, 8x the startups, and 8x more people making other people aware. 
The argument that we should throw this away because 8MB blocks don't create a near-infinitely scaling system today is lunacy. As in, it's @ crazy. The point is to scale the system within reasonable tolerances to let it grow over time.
Arguing differently is destructive, brinksmanship-like behavior. The internet didn't have fiber connections in the 90s either. We lived with 56k. But we also didn't say "no" to ASDL because fiber was theoretically possible.
Pure idiocy. I'm tired of having this conversation. Scale to 8MB and implement BIP101 style scaling or there will be a coup.

I didn't realize that he supported prop 8.
I was living in San Francisco at that time. I'm straight, but had plenty of gay friends. Special interest money from Utah pushed the vote over the line. Lots of people I know who were in long term relationships once again became second class citizens, and were economically disadvantaged vs. straight people.
Personally, I think that married straight people shouldn't receive any sort of legal benefits or official recognition at all, and find the entire idea of marriage primitive, superstitious, and ceremonial, but this set back equality and human rights years in the United States years.

It depends on jurisdiction, but it's pretty universal that if you make defamatory remarks about businesses or individuals, it's not up to the victims to prove that the remarks were untrue. It's on the accuser to prove that the remarks were true. It's usually grounds for civil suit, and sometimes it is a criminal matter.

This person has no idea what is causing the backlog. People will call it 'spam' and others will say blocks are full and Bitcoin is being suffocated.
What you can do is look at the long term trend of bitcoin transaction growth. It converges on a moving average that has hit a ceiling 6 months ago when median blocksize became 1MB.
A reasonable assessment? Usage has outgrown the capacity limit of 1MB. The latter now appears to be the case.

Segwit isn't about on-chain scaling. It's about break-even in terms of on-chain scaling. Segwit is about addressing transaction malleability for the specific purpose of enabling theoretical L2 networks like the lightning network. A much more directly way to scale on-chain without so much technical debt and new attack surface is flexible transactions with an increase and regular up-scale to the max_block_size.

We need to keep the ability to change the protocol completely separate from any SEC approval process. How many years have they been reviewing this ETF? 
We're going to have accidental forks, not just political ones. I think the ETF should specify that the parent cryptocurrency and any child cryptocurrencies (e.g. ETH-C and fork) are considered assets under management of the ETF, in the event of a fork event resulting in two separate chains/cryptocurrencies.
This shouldn't require an approval, but it will prevent the fund manager from absconding with child cryptocurrency that has market value, or screwing up and losing it due to mismanagement.
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:00:39
What you are suggesting will let speculators and hedge funds invest in Bitcoin, and once they have a large portion of outstanding Bitcoin under ETF management, it will now require BOTH developers AND a company with SEC/Government ties sufficient to modify the definition of the ETF filing (cough cough blokstreem cough)  in order to update Bitcoin.
Your suggestion, brazenly turns the regulatory friction of the SEC into an advantage for a single private company (monopoly, no competition) that controls the largest number of commits via developers and builds relationships with SEC regulators.
Anyone who tried to get user/miner support to change the protocol would LOSE the bitcoin under ETF control without SEC approval, regardless of whether or not the fund managers or investors approve of the change! This gives a huge unfair advantage to the group of developers controlling the software version specified in the ETF documentation under the umbrella of a single private company with a regulatory mandated monopoly, and is a massive power grab. 
That's insane!

I'm not pretty sure Adam cares a lot about decentralization. He hasn't contributed to the codebase, isn't active in discussion forums with the community, I'm not sure what he cares about at all outside of carefully crafted statements and closed meeting presentations to influencers and decision makers. 
Another guy who suddenly "appeared" on the scene. There is a long list of people like this depending on when you learned about the project. Looking at it from 2010, it gives you an interesting perspective.
We need to scale Bitcoin using BIP101 or any of the other safe, low complexity approaches as soon as possible, and we don't need permission.

Todd and blokstreem marketing this defensive patent licensing seems disingenuous. Why?
Their companies' business models doesn't rely on patents! They are all open source projects with value because they CONTROL development, or they own wallet companies like GreenAddress that get VIP service over other wallets (see RBF).
The companies that DO want bigger blocks are relying on patents, because they offer actual services customers use, and aren't working on the protocol directly!
I don't feel like this is good will. It feels like a very calculated move to hurt service companies that support scaling in a way that doesn't really hurt blokstreem.

Does that company have any patents? 
Perhaps it would be more insightful if you disclosed financial stakes in any company where you own warrants, equity, or take other compensation?
Why isn't it standard that all core developers disclose conflicts of interest? 
I am making an assumption that there are conflicts of interest. I suppose I shouldn't do that. 
Let's start by asking the right question.
Do you have any conflicts of interest, defined as ownership or compensation from companies that derive their value (positively or negatively) from the code you work on for Bitcoin, Peter?

[First, law enforcement agencies are already well aware of this scam]( so you may be leading a charge that's already been started with this post.
Second, the last time enforcement agencies cracked down on a major Ponzi, it was Bitcoin Savings and Loan.
This was before your time with Bitcoin, but the end result was: a) the FBI put the guy away and b) Virtual Currency (i.e. Bitcoin and all Cryptocurrency) was classified as "money" according to the SEC, opening it up to new types of regulation.
I agree OneCoin is incredibly dangerous for their victims, and also for the reputation of real cryptocurrency (which OneCoin is not), but for someone that is publicly so anti-regulation, this is a strange position to see you taking.

Proof? He supports it, but isn't 'behind' it. Zander seems to be the developer behind a lot of it. 
I prefer BU to core, and I'm not in any way affiliated with Peter R. I thought he had some really good work on the economics of blocksize, although I think he skipped the part about the dangers of a cumulative effect of larger blocks creating storage issues for unpruned nodes (which are essential to decentralization, in my opinion).
I love the idea of BU with some better limits on default blocksize, and I certainly prefer the simplicity and elegance with which they address scaling. I'm terrified of some of the complexity Core has been introducing in their newest release candidates, and I feel they have become completely tone deaf regarding the spirit of the project and needs of their user base.

DPL is a great idea and I support it in general.
Businesses operate for profit. Intellectual property is worth money. It can be sold, bought, and licensed.
Some businesses have processes, technology, and approaches that are not patentable, and are profitable for other reasons.
Other businesses have processes, technology and approaches that are patentable, and whether we agree with patent law ideologically, patenting some of these things creates a profitable asset for these other businesses.
The former businesses do not lose value from complying with DPL, the latter lose much.
If you separate the ideology of DPL from business facts, you see companies that operate services using Bitcoin lose much more from DPL than those focused on protocol level work.
Simplifying, this is because you can't patent processes in an open source protocol, especially when the development effort includes a minority of non-employee contractor contributors, but you can patent business functions running on top of a protocol built by a private company's employees and contractors exclusively.
If you separate the ideology from the business facts, you can see that supporting DPL is a marketing stunt for companies who don't have valuable/marketable/defensible patents (any patents on the bitcoin protocol are almost guaranteed to be in conflict with prior art that is open source), or revenue generating products that have patented processes, and hurts the bottom line of companies who do have patentable revenue generating products complying with DPL.
I mean, in short, the people and companies hyping their DPL policy are giving up nothing of value, but other companies, which not coincidentally fall on the other side of the divide around scaling bitcoin natively, would be, and that all of this DPL hype is completely ignoring this fact.

No, bitcoin transactions are not spam, and Bitcoin is tiny. It's so tiny that letting it grow and taking advantage of Meltcalfe's law is orders of magnitude more important than obsessing over storage space.
There is a cost benefit to every new transaction. You, requirescat, repeatedly ignore and misrepresent this math, as well as Moore's law and Nielsen's law's effects on making that cost exponentially smaller over time by repeating patently absurd On2 arguments that have already been addressed and/or debunked countless times.
Your entire reason for posting on subreddits about Bitcoin seems to be here to keep a circular argument going... in a circle.
