What's the difference? Like I said before technically 1btc is just a metric for 100,000,000 Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:33:54
Banks require not only more power than Bitcoin but they also require the need to profit off loaning and gambling your money and what do you get from it? A measly 1-2% interest?  If you had sound money you would gain much more value than that as the economy grows. The whole argument that Bitcoin isn't environmentally friendly is preposterous.

But technically those new divisible parts are added to the supply right. Forget that the decimal is there. Technically 1btc is just a metric for 100,000,000 Satoshi.

This is such a bullshit issue when you take in consideration how much volume isn't even accounted for as it happens of the exchanges via OTC. I don't know why this is so talked about. Besides if it's fake now it was fake before only now there is more "real" volume. They're just trying anything to keep the price low while so they can accumulate.

I understand that but not nearly as easily or as fast. In the future gold will take the place of copper. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 02:27:01
Well people are going to have to get used to it because Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and it's far more divisible than gold and infinitely more scarce.
@_date: 2019-03-18 02:39:26
Besides, that's the excuse were given as to why we left the gold standard. The truth is that enormous deposits of gold were discovered and kept secret so the economy wouldn't tank because of it. Meanwhile they used the fiat system to drive enormous progress to get us where we are today and they will drive it to infinity until it doesn't work anymore. We're moving into a future where the most important decisions on the economy will be decided by a truly free market and carried out in a trustless fashion without the need for third parties or human corruption. I'm sure if people had a deflationary currency they would be fine with dismal interest rates since the value is continually appreciating anyway.

Great chatting with you too. It's so rare to have a conversation with people on forums like this that doesn't end with one calling the other a name or getting ugly. 
If you think about it though everyone is biased in their own way. 
But my point is that Bitcoin has an absolute finite supply as of today and that would be next to impossible to change without breaking every fundamental that it's founded upon. However with gold this is not the case. Even if the secret deposits don't/didn't exist the probability that some do somewhere is a certainty. It's known that just recently NASA has spotted an asteroid dubbed 433 Eros between here and Mars that has $700 quintillion worth of gold at today's gold value. Granted that it will be a while and take allot of money to get to it and bring it to Earth but that is still an unfathomable number and proves my point. And if they were to pursue it the price of gold would tank.

Actually loans on an appreciating currency could just be extremely low interest set by the free market instead of some centralized institution to offset the point your trying to make. Your wage could be set for life without ever needing a raise. Once Bitcoin is used and accepted by everyone it will not be near as volatile and it would be much easier to project reasonable interest rates to the tune of .01% or lower. People could just save for retirement instead of having to gamble it in the markets. Right now crypto is a gamble but in the future it won't be and companies looking for investment will need to be much more responsible.
@_date: 2019-03-18 11:28:19
If you look at old newspapers from the early 1900's you will see huge headlines about giant deposits of gold being found in many places in the US, the big one being the grand canyon which is off limits to the the public. The main point is that's it's easy to hide how much gold there really is but it's impossible with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-10-13 00:12:00
That's because most people in developed countries don't feel the need to use Bitcoin yet but as inflation continues bitcoins killer app will make itself apparent and people will understand as their governments continue to debase their currency. Do you understand how many people don't even realize that BTC is divisible? They think they can't afford it because they can't afford a whole one. That just shows how early it is.

Right but it's also scarce. However it lacks liquidity. This is why currency exists. Currency is ultimately a useless thing which sole purpose is to be used as a liquidity pool for other assets to be traded for. Before currency everything was traded via barter.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to measure your dollars against a metric like that which we do length or distance? A foot/meter is still the same foot it was a hundred years ago. Yet we don't have such a metric for value. Or do we? The reason such metrics for length don't change is because in order for such a change to happen would take great consensus of everyone using that metric. Think of Bitcoin in that way. There's a certain amount that will ever exist just like there is a certain defined length in a foot/meter that will never change because it's found it's objective length. Bitcoin is going through it's decades long "price discovery" which right now is valued in dollars because that's what we've been used to for so long but eventually, due to its defined and unalterable scarcity, it will be the defined metric for which all other things of value will be measured against. Don't get me wrong value would be valued against anything, except dollars value drop over time without fail because that's how they're designed to inflate in supply but not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the first truly scarce by design metric for value. For a long time it will go up in dollar value just like a foot or meter of land goes up in dollar value over time but that's not the land's fault, it's the dollars fault. Do you get what I'm saying? Better tech will surely be developed than Bitcoin but because Bitcoin was first makes it THE metric kind of like gold was the first metric of value however gold doesn't have the defined scarcity like Bitcoin because gold could and mathematically probably is infinite in the scope of the universe unlike Bitcoin. Bitcoin is what gold strived to be and that is truly scarce by design. Do you understand the point I'm making?

There "cry wolf" effect definitely is a factor in this market and lack of reaction to it but there is one thing that people have to realize and consider is that regulations are a BITCH. They are necessary tho if any institution will feel comfortable getting into this space. They may seem slow to us crypto investors especially considering the speed at which this market moves but they are the antibiotics to everything that taints this space and if you know US regulators then you will realize they are actually moving extremely fast on this because they know crypto isn't waiting around for them. Another thing to note is that when we learn these types of things they are usually away priced in because we're the last to hear the news. Meaning many have already front run this news and may even sell it. This is why you have to keep your eye on the long term outlook and invest accordingly. Which means don't fomo, buy the dips (what you can afford to lose) and just live your life without depending on a 3-5x run up on the next 6 months otherwise you will be guaranteed to be disappointed and full of regret when you miss time the market for short term gains all at the expense of being so short sighted. Remember that unless you're one of the 5 percent of the best traders in the world (crypto is global) you will lose. Believe me I know. Dollar cost averaging with your head down is your best bet statistically. And know that bakkt no matter when it finally happens really does make more of a difference than any of your realize. It opens up the remote possibility of the ETF that you all pray for (not very remote if you ask me; more inevitable) and if you're waiting for the release of the ETF to buy I guarantee you be buying the top of the next bubble.

Except if demand for big Macs became large enough more are produced to meet that demand. With sound money that's not possible by definition. Just like metrics of length. If something is longer than a foot/meter you don't change the objective length of the metric, you measure it using more units of that metric. This is why quantitative easing is a joke.

I get what you're saying however when people say "blockchain's killer app" it isn't meaning "app" as in a program on your phone or computer that lets you interface with the blockchain. It's the actual applying of blockchain technology to do a certain thing. In this case the Bitcoin blockchain is applying the tech to create a sovereign form of money which can't be debased, censored, or confiscated. I agree that it's not ready for mass adoption however Bitcoin itself is still the killer app if blockchain the way email was the first killer app if the internet in the beginning. What you're talking about is the need for somebody to develop the easy to use interface for Bitcoin such as AOL or Windows over dos.

It could allow everyone to voice their opinions on every piece of legislation proposed by pretty much anyone instead of only lawmakers. It could allow open source government. Anyone with a good idea could write a proposal and submit it onto the blockchain where voters could vote on it anytime they want allowing voters to actually make informed decisions instead of going into the voting booth with no knowledge of a candidate or topic/issue being voted on. Or even have voters contribute their thoughts and opinions on a myriad of topics creating a digital representation of their political beliefs on the blockchain where AI could be delegated to vote on their behalf on certain issues allowing for an uncorruptible representative. There are many ways it could be implemented but first we need to have the discussion and educate the masses on what blockchain is and what it means to remove the stigma of digital voting and the such.

If you are new to crypto you are really going to want to research best practices in security and diligence. Like if you are going to hold your own keys you will want something like a hardware wallet which tbh if your not investing much it's not worth buying until your investment grows beyond a few hundred dollars. If you are going to dollar cost average stick to that plan and don't fomo in because the price moons. It's better to believe in the tech and if your going to go all in do it after a sizable drop in price and cash out half after a double in price. Dollar cost averaging is there best investment strategy for newbies. Don't try to trade and if you do trade at all or spend BTC keep track of all transactions for tax purposes.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:04:49
I'd suggest taking the lump sum of what you want to invest and split it into equal portions and dollar cost average over the next six months or so. So say if you wanted to invest half (60k) do about 2300 a week or 330 a day for the next six months or half of that amount for a year if you want stretch it out for longer. I'm not saying that you should invest everything into crypto but it's all I do lol. Safest bet is Bitcoin but I'm sure as you learn about other coins you will want to own those too just make sure to do your own research and only buy something that you will be positive enough about to buy more or keep holding when it goes down. Don't tell too many people about your investments and sure as hell don't post your holdings online. You will get hacked or rolled.

No I put about 10% of each paycheck into BTC because I know it's a better store if value than dollars in a savings account and the fact that it's so early and only 1% penetration of the global market so there is still huge potential for growth. Don't invest what you're not willing to lose, not because you will lose it but because you don't want to be too emotional with the swings down. Definitely get a hardware wallet like ledger (only buy directly from ledger) and keep your seed in multiple safe places. Don't keep on an exchange. Don't try to trade unless you know what you're doing. And definitely don't trade with your whole stack. Keep track of all trades and purchases for tax purposes. Pick a target price or date that you want to sell it start selling and sick to the plan.
