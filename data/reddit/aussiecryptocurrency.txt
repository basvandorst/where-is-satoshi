My god.  This logic is what kills Bitcoin. Finding fault in fiat/cc does not chalk up a win to Bitcoin. Businesses won't stop accepting cash or cards because that's not how businesses work: they need to make money, they don't run on idealism.

But then there'd be cries of censorship and market forces and the need for choice and personal responsibility. I'll say that last one again: PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.
you can't have it both ways and demand no regulation or exchange security precautions then piss and moan and lodge complaints demanding regulation or moderation when it doesn't go your way. This isn't a new scam: anyone using PayPal to trade Bitcoin is an idiot, which is clear from the people saying LBC is as fault here
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:29:48


Are they voting to achieve consensus? (Ie mining) Are these ppl coding? Are these ppl ok with the idea of someone taking charge and implementing it through code?
No. No and no. 
You're strongly in favour of it, we get it. No need to make it all quasi-conspiratorial or personal. Rationalise your stance and back it with quantifiable points instead of qualitative sensationalism, and it'd add value to the discussion. This whole post boils down to the *"anyone in disagreement with my view is a ~~Buttcoin troll~~ ~~paid shill~~ Altcoin traitor"*

This platitude! Again! Yes, they cannot understand it because...? It's not quantum mechanics FFS. These are regulators that deal with the financial hub for the first world. They're more than capable of understanding Bitcoin. 
In fact the only misunderstanding seems to be that Bitcoin wasn't going to happen. If there were more moderates willing to come to the table maybe a better outcome could've been reached.
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:50:59


1. Semantics of whether censoring is censorship still ends in censoring what you don't like

@_date: 2015-06-28 12:31:39


This platitude is unhelpful. You're saying that anyone who disagrees doesn't get it. There's a huge amount of people who know of Bitcoin but have no compelling reason to use it. Make compelling arguments and this could be different. Writing off these people as misinformed presupposes your *opinion* is right and those not sharing it are wrong. You can't expect people to respond well to this.

Can you clarify "disruptive"? Because businesses have done cost benefit analyses and found it cheaper to stick with the centralised models. 


Streaming video was RealMedia's expertise and was strong in 1996. No one ever thought streaming video wouldn't take off. I'm thinking you may not remember this because you were quite young. 


1. Blockbuster made a bad business decision and couldn't stay on top.... **So why use them as an example of being stumped at not leveraging the Internet?**
2. Netflix started **by shipping physical DVDs for rental**. (It was possible)
3. None of this analogy is apt in any way because your assumption is that decentralised services do/will outcompete centralised ones in terms of cost. 
**TL:DR**: *how, _specifically_, are decentralised ledgers disruptive?* on cost, efficiency...?
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:32:18

Yeah, but they're costing a lot less to procure. Miners sell for a profit, obviously. So if a miner is in collusion with a party (hypothetically) then the price of the coins for the miner is far less then market value; hell, these coins could be from 5 years ago. I recently found an old address with ฿5 that came from Gavin's faucet. That's how worthless people thought Bitcoin was: there's a lot of people with a lot of coins out there.

This. This 1000 times this. Ask what the other person wants and listen and discuss on that point. If you're asserting Bitcoin will replace fiat and the government is evil etc to someone who doesn't agree, it's counterproductive arguing that Bitcoin will succeed and will replace fiat etc. It's a very tall order to argue Bitcoin is the start of a new world order.

Social contract? Satoshi wrote a whitepaper in 2008 and bailed on Bitcoin completely ~4 years ago. 
Bitcoin is 
1) an experiment 
2) not functionally complete, as is
3) possibly hamstrung by inability to adjust
Satoshi was a group of people, or a person; this deity worship of the whitepaper decree is just ridiculous.

Explain to your friend you got wrapped up in the excitement; a lot of people **knew for sure** Bitcoin's price was going to keep going up. It's not possible to be 100% certain. 
On the flip side: if your friend had made a million bucks, would he be the type to acknowledge that his comfortable position was your doing (in part)?
It's an unwinnable situation: even if he got in at $100 and it went to $1100, what's to say he'd have cashed out in time? Or lost the cash to Mt Gox? Or been hacked?

It's literally the same story every time with a twist. Usually a woman pops up out of nowhere and screams that Bitcoin is for drugs and is a ponzi while the OP calmly explains the situation in a sagely manner. And it's always an adult oppressing younger minds being taught about Bitcoin. 
Generally it's these posts which are so incredibly convoluted and long that makes me think of tall stories: a story which is apparently validated by the amount of content. 
If this was any different the post would ask **what can I do different next to secure a lecture position?**. But no, it's just "oh well, I'll keep trying, sorry to fail you". Sorry is if you've done something wrong. Did you? Or did you need a whole backstory to justify being told that Bitcoin wasn't suitable for a chemistry/physics/math/biology lecture?

The problem is no one cares about anything but price: if a Bitcoin 2.0 with a better Blockchain came to be, watch how quickly the decentralisation and unbanked rhetoric goes out the window.

I'm not sure where you get this idea, because 4-5 years ago, everyone was adding to Bitcoin by coding and such. There's less nodes than ever before, less core devs and all anyone talks about is price. It's literally 1 in 100 posts here that anyone even discusses tech stuff, with the other 99 being assertions of Bitcoin destroying fiat and the price headed to the moon.

Because I've been around since the beginning (well, 2010). The tech drew me in and keeps me interested. There's always been the libertarian element but it was a rough 50/50 split. Now the political component is like 90%. I'm not sure if tech people have left or the political people have grown, but I've always been interested in the tech side.
FWIW I think Bitcoin has a great use case in DNMs. That being said, I'm agnostic and would be just as happy to see any cryptocurrency succeed if it's learning from Bitcoin's limitations (though altcoins, IMO, have failed to do so). I've always seen Bitcoin as what it is: a cool tech experiment.

I was trying to convince my dad (who is in his 70s, retired) to invest ~$100k. I was amazed he kept using logic in line with his Economics degree which he earned in the 60s; "nothing is a sure thing" he kept saying. I was **certain** the price would hit $10,000 by late 2014. I was furious: "why couldn't he see what I **know**?" 
After seeing the consequences of what could have been, I began to ask myself: "how can I be *certain*?" and "how can I *know* for sure, the price will explode?". Like my dad said, *"nothing is a sure thing"*. 
Another remark he made really sticks with me: *"never mix money (investment) with friends/family"*

It was also where the more recent BCI RNG issue was uncovered first. It was also where BFL was lampooned on a satirical blog before BFL decided to buy the blog and change it to glowing reviews. 
I don't agree with malicious antics like attacking Bitcoin with bots or DDOS or anything similar, nor do most of Buttcoin.

People don't hate Bitcoin. They dislike the antisocial behaviour of the Bitcoin community. They're skeptical, which is something many (not all) Bitcoiners take issue with. There's literally no room for any doubt; plus, people aren't all privacy nuts or libertarians or anti-fiat. They see fringe beliefs like this as distasteful.
Then there's the inept hard sells that are pushed upon people who may not have a need for Bitcoin. 
If I heard about Bitcoiners faxing the treasury with black faxes (to waste their ink) then I'd stay far away. It's even worse for those who adopt Bitcoin, then remove it as an option when it's not used: the brigading by some in the community in retaliation is what people want to avoid.

Yes, it's far stretched. It's OP's opinion, but I take issue when these opinions are completely baseless and dressed up as analyses. 
For Bitcoin to be useful it needs to be spent like a currency, but that's not happening (it's called hodling; buying BTC and not spending it).
Furthermore, basing predictions on price history is irrelevant. Yeah, there's patterns that can be spotted, but this doesn't take into account the litany of possible variables effecting those supposed patterns. The **only** correlation I'd argue is with the popularity and health of the darknet marketplace ecosphere (Silk Road is what kicked off Bitcoin into the mainstream, as Nathaniel Popper notes in Digital Gold, page 54)
TLDR: no one can be certain of anything. Detractors can't prove Bitcoin will die, just as proponents can't prove Bitcoin will be a financial windfall.

There you go big guy. I added the slash between emulate and outpace so you can deduce what the sentence means. Clearly it was the grammar stopping you understanding the question and not you just wanting to pick on a typo to avoid answering the question. So now it's cleared up, I'll ask again;
Can an amateur programmer (a 2bit programmer as it was put) really outpace bank level security? And if so, how is it that this is done?
PSA I've chosen the Oxford method of utilising commas and my English uses the letter 's' for words where American English would use a 'z'. I just don't want you confused about what utilise means, because utilise is a different spelling of utilize.

You know what, Myspace was "the place" in 2006. Then someone tweaked the idea and we have Facebook now.
So yes, you're all correct, there is no Bitcoin with it's Blockchain, but in a very black and white way of seeing these issues is overlooking the gray certainty; that OTHER Blockchains can and will exist and have nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
HAMILTON QUOTES:




Thank you! Some calm, rational discussion. 
The fact that probably 50% of people posting think Bitcoin will take the Blockchain with *if* it dies is... a bit shocking. There is no certainty in any of this. We're not even running Bitcoin Core v1 yet. So before you decide this will be the next currency for Earth-ica, everyone should learn to consider the problems Bitcoin has and how to address them - instead of screaming at anyone with a differing viewpoint like this guy.

If you can't give money away to techies in college that's something the media can quote again and again. And why not? People actually couldn't be bothered getting free money.

Why does this community have such an issue with every fucking service growing Bitcoin? Oh they're making $36k per annum? They're millionaires in 33 years! Best to call for an audit to prove just how much trouble any business is up for if they get into the Bitcoin space, right? But hey, even the core developers are expected to be paid nothing because the community wants transparency there too. This tactic may backfire in that who the fuck is going to develop the core software, or invest in a Bitcoin startup, or use Bitcoin for charity? Audit them all! Make it so unbearable to operate in the space it scares others off. Unbelievable.

You think Govt shills are holding Bitcoin down with their social media accounts? Au contraire... it's (wildly off-topic) media accounts like yours which cause Bitcoin morew trouble than any planned smear campaign could implement.
All this non-mainstream ideaology is going to make Bitcoin a hot-topic, "don't go near it" because it's filled with the same trouble as debates on:

What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:12:33


I didn't mean to imply that incentives are inseparable. Yes, incentive is needed to secure a blockchain or any distributed network. That incentive can range from simple "feel good" / intellectual satisfaction (SETI, Fold it) to monetary rewards which can include the Bitcoin mining process.
My argument is "not all dogs are poodles, but all poodles are dogs". Ie Bitcoin is a blockchain "species", but not all of the blockchain "species" (applications) are Bitcoin, or even currency for that matter. 
So Bitcoin is inseparable from blockchain, but blockchain technology is NOT inseparable from Bitcoin. And this is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:55:12
That's actually a really good point. I've always assumed if I was in that position I'd liquidate to fiat because forensics would track the coinbase address from the mining rigs' IPs through the Blockchain though, but either way, I guess there's a Blockchain trail.

This. I tried rallying the troops but the assumptions seems to be this... **BTC is too great to fail!** Does anyone believe we're ready out of any knowledge "in the trenches"? I'll give an example;
Remember before Google, how hard it was to find information without a ton of work? That's because the Internet hadn't matured yet. Bitcoin is coded in the most hodgepodge manner it is nearly undecipherable for anyone wanting to develop. The assumption that BTC is a beautiful swan born to fly gracefully is untrue; BTC is an ugly duckling needing to be fed to make it long enough until it's not the ugly duckling.
For the love of God, listen to Satoshi if not me; "No don't bring it on", he said in reply to some over-eager BCT post saying "to bring (it)..on" re: WikiLeaks BTC donations. 


That's sounds very nice. What does the plan of action mean though? All of this (not just you, mate) reminds me of the South Park episode where all the hippies are rallying the troops to a festival to fight the corporations ruining the Earth. The outcome: they complained for 10 days while getting high and never *did* anything. I don't think this "shackled by the economy" is going to be the best play for mass adoption any more than convincing others you're departing with your cult in a UFO with the leader (possibly Satoshi!).
Think about it from a rational point of view; if people came in here and saw the viciousness directed at dissenting opions, would they be *more* or *less* likely to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate option? 
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:54:33

The "community" that has a problem with everyone from banks to media to core developers? 
Because no one ever seems to agree on anything except being in disagreement. If the community had the means to do what TBF does let's step up and do it. 
But that brings us back to never being in full agreement and quite frankly it's generally reactive; there's still argument about regulation that keeps rolling out but how often do you see a post for a petition? Or a small "committee" to counteract Issue A and B?

1. Limit of 7 txns per second. Visa/PayPal &gt;&gt;10000/sec
2. No chargebacks; people are used to chargebacks and not losing their funds if they're not tech savvy enough
3. Most people have no idea re security. You can judge cluelessness by the number of toolbars like Ask in their browser. Bitcoin getting stolen is a real issue
4. You need ID to buy btc in most cases and there are SilkRoad negative connotations with Bitcoin. That's preventing mass adoption
5. Volatile prices; if I bought something using PayPal it's not going to cost more or less depending on the week. People don't like exchange rates because they feel they can use dollars and not worry

What are you basing this assumption on?
My assumptions are based on shady tactics of parallel construction, and in general, utilizing any and every technological advancement available. 
Let's look at all 3 points: 
*Entry*: If you've logged in just once via a non TOR ip and shown private key ownership, the trail starts. 
*Inside* As for mixers; I'd consider any surviving this week's culling suspect. But assuming tumblers do what they say; they're still mixing btc with btc which is all essentially dirty. It's certainly within any mathematicians' power to weed out related transactions then find balances or patterns or straight up links between transaction.
*exit*:  you have $2 million in btc like the Irish guy who got nailed yesterday. You going to tumble that? Nope. You have a very good chance of getting nailed cashing out your btc to cash. 
I'd be going on the assumption that LE gave your info if you've used TOR or BTC. [See?]( :-/

I've tried rallying the troops myself. These difficult questions are just that.. Difficult. I'm glad you've raised this point because it tells me 2 things:
1. A sizable portion of this subreddit seem to be concerned about sharing information which gets downvoted for not being "good" news
2. If you stop learning to read and talk from deafness you have problems later on with communication. Bitcoin's community is no different; going deaf to these hard questions **will** undoubtedly come back later and cause more problems
No one should feel like they're being picked on here. We're all **a community**! Let's act like a community and solve problems and expedite the testing of all possible issues **before mass adoption by the general populace**! 
We all have different views here and that is our strength. We can use that to beta test Bitcoin and give it the best chance of a successful launch.
Fellow Bitcoin lovers, I implore you, **consider the tough questions**. Please, **don't downvote or revert to name calling with dissenters**. For every negative article that gets written, we need to band together and positively harness our power to **inform**.
If you disagree with anyone at anytime, please remember this isn't Twitter. You can respond and share your viewpoint.
We can do this together and speed up the developers' hard work. The more we avoid testing the superb protocol that is Bitcoin, the harder the developers' job is. 
**Do you believe in Bitcoin 100%?** 
If so, keep this in mind:
* what would Andreas do? :)
* ask yourself "does it do any harm to discuss Bitcoin in a negative light **if the outcome is good for bitcoin**?"
* if you don't know the ins and outs of Bitcoin (ie you're in it for profit only) shouldn't you learn? 
**I want to run a weekly quiz to inform everyone; if there's interest, of course! Any takers on say a 10 question weekly quiz?**
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:32:42
No more childish than the tone of discussion! 
Seriously, if Bitcoin is so certain in its place in history why the fuck is everyone getting pitchforks out over an article? *He should be fired, he's a shill, we need to brigade the powers...* Oh? 
Because I've come to see this "community" is a rabid mob attacking everything that piques their brigadier hat; Western Union, core developers, TBF, respected economists, respected financial publications, naysayers, supporters, people who lose Bitcoin, people who make Bitcoin, websites who report on Bitcoin, websites who don't report on Bitcoin, charities, profitable businesses, exchanges, wallet services.... I could go on. 
There's not a single thing any of this is doing but alienating everyone. I always defended Bitcoin and believed it would prosper. No longer.

Can someone ELI5 how judging the price based on what it does in a week is indicative of anything more than just numbers? It's just as volatile as it ever was. The "trolls" never said Bitcoin was dead. They said it's not ready for mass adoption because of the volatility. Judging Bitcoin (negatively or positively) from a week of price data is like watching 1 minute of a basketball game and deciding Michael Jordan is awful/great based on that 1 minute from the entire season. 
So yes, it's great Bitcoin bounced back in price. But no one said Bitcoin's success was based on this week's price AFAIK!

Cloud mining is more of a scam than ASIC mining. Even ASIC mining forced everyone into BFL before the bubble burst. It'll happen again with cloud mining.

No. They can't. They can't when mining conglomerates like Ghash.io are only limited against a 51% attack because "it's not in their best interest". We're not mining with CPUs.

I don't know the details of TBF's position but I can certainly say I see eye to eye with you on this. It's fine to be anarchistic or libertarian but pick your battles is what I'm thinking; and of course limit these scams which are going to catch up and bite someone on the ass. There's an assumption that Bitcoin is so revolutionary nothing can stop it. I disagree; lack of diplomacy and lack of proactive strategies like TBF is engaging in can quite easily amplify the pain of regulation.

 Don't want to get in a pissing match here. If you want to hear the quotes from Andreas himself they relate to the distributed consensus proof of work system being great for currency amongst other uses. You're not wrong - there is no webpage outlining how it's all going to go down. It's over simplistic saying complementary technology which isn't currency based can be squared up against Bitcoin. Use cases are coming out daily. I don't understand how Ethereum or Ripple fits into the big picture but I know there is a bigger picture.
If you get the chance to listen to Andreas' Canadian senate speech again there's a handful of examples which fit in well with this quote.
I guess it comes down to this: if all of this is built on Bitcoin's blockchain (ie is reliant on Bitcoin) how can it be bad? A house of cards needs the table to stay standing right?
@_date: 2014-10-30 22:39:12

The genesis block coinbase transaction for 50 BTC is not spendable.
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:33:45
 
 
May I begin by noting that for someone who doesn't stoop to badmouthing their competitors (your words), you've done a lot of badmouthing. CoinDesk allegedly ignores comments, is implied to be in cahoots with crooked cloud miners, censors/deletes comments for articles, profits from advertising, has faulty price index algorithms, creates Nermins aka journalists which are fictional... I could go on and on. Not a single compliment that isn't followed by a "but...". And this from CoinDesk, who you say you "respect"?
 
The alleged disservice CoinDesk does to Bitcoin is lost and will soon be the MySpace to your Facebook it seems. Although you have no income you vaguely talk of *"monetization with bitcoin enabled technology (being easier to implement than (they) would think"* and chastise cookies, email address databases, Google Analytics and the despicable practice of a media publication selling ads! But that's not your style! Your investors will reap the rewards of the dis-serviced CoinDesk readers; fantastic for a company two paragraphs earlier claimed it was working for no income.
 
But thankfully your moral compass allows you to service the richest people with the best mobile devices (you got that data from where? Google Analytics? Say it ain't so Mahatma!). Because the third world with their poor cities, 3G non-smart phones - the unbankable - why on Earth would Bitcoin's potential apply to the country of Africa? But I digress, you have no proof of any accusations, but surely your background is in the scope of arguing this. It's not like astronauts who are actors; you've got to have some credentials, so let's hear your wisdom's genesis and nurturer; what are your credentials?
 
**"I am not a journalist** *and my company wasn’t even founded to be media outlet"* - agh, ok, go on: *"but it happened to be an easy thing to do and it supports our more important R&amp;D efforts."*
 
Phew! Thank god it's not for the integrity, but for your *"more important R&amp;D costs"!*
*"We made a decision to do it with integrity and I hope we can hold ourselves to this standard always."*
I'm lost.
*"We have also made mistakes..."* Oh, mistakes! I'm glad you recognize these things happen. Sometimes sources get misquoted, or the source is a liar (CNN are just as guilty for reporting OJ Simpson was innocent?), and sometimes, people have no info if sources or proof, which is where we can agree - people who report in a manner emulating journalists but have no facts to back their opinions, or require disclaimers in the heading, are low-lifes. So tell me about these pieces of evidence you have disproving the alleged fake CoinDesk journalist's report...
 
*"how he got them (the photos/quotes), I don’t know and if they are real I don’t know."*
Anything else?
*"I have suspicions about (their) practices and social media followers, but I don’t have the data to say anything."*
Cmon, give me something here!
*"I have noticed and documented issues with his reporting over the past year and a half, but in business you should never speak bad about a competitor, so I bit my tongue."*
 
That takes character. That seems at odds with your "theses" though.... how can you rationalize this?
*"We are tiny compared to (CoinDesk) and do not have access to (their) resources."*
 
Oh my.
 
Let's report on your open-letter calling for community boycott of your competitor shall we?
 
*"Your reporting is not accurate, how can I trust your data?"* you ask Coindesk. I often trust the time on the TV even if CNN fudges the facts. It's math. But proof is not something you have much of. Can I ask you, likewise; *"Your reporting is not accurate, how can I trust your data?"*
 
Oh and you believe cloud mining is a scam? Based on what? Proof? Or is it proof that may turn out less black and more gray as details emerge? Because journalists acting on information usually can't give a post-mordem dissection. They have sources, they report the news, and then you come by and point out how clear your 20/20 Hindsight vision is? But you're not a journalist. You're a cancer to Bitcoin growth. Your yearnings for new world order are not welcomed by me. Nor Nermin, I assume. But I'm just glad you've got so much integrity to remain anonymous while you call the plays from your quarterback armchair. 
If you love Bitcoin then do something for it; realize your chance of winning an all out war on fiat and banking systems and privacy may be slightly less favorable than introducing technology without the diatribe. I think you need a reality check. Pull your head out of the chat rooms and see the responses average Joes have to your anarchistic machinations. I assure you, Joe doesn't want a new world order, no more than I want a Bitcoin fundamentalist zealot assuring me salvation lies in the hearts of the good people of the "Bitcoin community" and that he's keeping the conglomerate Goliath honest. *"Nothing is more important than code hygiene and accurate data when it comes to bitcoin."* ED: Also: *"Don’t forget, both gold and bitcoin are open source."* ([author](
Uh, huh.
 
You want cloud hashing miners punished? And it's CoinDesk's job? After all, journalists pushing regulatory practices and risking law suits isn't what you volunteered! Oh no! That's CoinDesk's job! If the "community" backs you you're right, if not you say you'll apologise for being wrong. The community disagrees and you're wrong? What?
 
But we're off topic; because this is just a veil for your self-appointed noble quest to send an open letter (vs, you know, like email) to decry ethics, and honor and everything else you have none of. An angry, little man who hides behind half-remembered libertarian quotes (and possibly a few unopened boxes of [Seroquel]( is all you are and I think you should accept that whatever your business is, it's bound to fail.

Indeed. Rational discussion is usually best found at  or

Worse, imagine the people writing these articles for prestigious companies/periodicals like the WSJ seeing the viciousness of the mob. It only reinforces "tulip mania". Why? Because when a whole subreddit calls for blood every time a balanced piece is published, it validates the whole "Bitcoin cult" assumptions.
Bitcoin has just integrated multisig but most people believe BTC is ready to take on Visa and the banking system; in fact, with the news about PayPal being so positive is it only the price that really matters? Because that's what most ppl talk about. The mythical certainty of $10k BTC.

It's about fucking time people start speaking up about this crap. Yes, it's kinda light hearted entertainment, but the billion dollar part actually makes it impossible to know if this is satire or not. **people have no idea whether people are trolling now because posts are pure insanity**.

Shit, maybe gambling services should be off-chain! ie the Gentoo debacle everyone is up in arms about.
80% of the top 10 most used addresses are for dice sites. The average txn cost according to BCI is ~$10.50 per txn. Perhaps you see why I support in stopping this, since Satoshi dice etc are using 2011 technology and not scaling themselves.

Your condescending sweeping assumptions are fantastically cliche. I love your "technically correct is the best kind of correct" stance too. This is why people are rushing to use Bitcoin. They love being talked down to by people like yourself. 
There will never be a point where people get confused because they want nothing to do with Bitcoin. You think changing Blockchain's name is going to be a barrier? Just what do you think is holding people back from adopting Bitcoin given they tried it out a year ago? 
The biggest confusion is actually the misnomer of community; the "community" is impossible to tell apart from detractors.

Nice way to go about your problem. Take it on Reddit like a champ.
You're the reason ppl want nothing to do with Bitcoin. Getting the public image of a company trashed is a certainty if you accept Bitcoin bc you want service, and damn their polite explanations.
I'm sure this stunt will expedite future issues (ie there won't be the choice of Bitcoin). Who needs Buttcoin or shills to blame when this "community" is clearly capable of sinking it on its own ... Basically the Titanic with the engines on making sure if you're going down then everyone goes down. Great work. Thanks so much for bringing this issue to light in your lovely manner.

It's undoubtedly a trial; with all the petitioning for BTC donation options you'd hope charities/NPOs were increasing their donations using Bitcoin. 
Of course it's not about donating to Wikipedia or Mozilla though;




Considering how often Wikipedia (generally) appreciated and frequently utilised, you'd think the above comments were the fringe minority... nope! As per usual, the donations aren't coming in any quicker with Bitcoin because nobody donates; they just complain.


**Next year?!** What makes you think after brigading for BTC Donations falls flat that Wikipedia will adopt it again **next year**?

It's a certainty like 1865 meant the end of racism. Or the late 19th century Diesel engine signalled the end of coal burning. Or "An Inconvenient Truth" (the doco, idea also) stopped CO2 emissions?

[Does this look like trolling to you?](
From **2 months ago**...
I tried to run a tutorial and was downvoted and told to fuck off.
Why would I spend my time helping a bunch of people who don't want help? I've said it 1000 times, and I'll say it again: the buttcoin crew is a majority of people who like the technology but do not like the community. And I'm one of them. Buttcoin isn't an organized malevolent secret society. We have discussions on thing that can never happen here: [from yesterday](
I've got great reputation on SE and stay there because I'm not treated like shit. 
This fucking community told my 72 year old Dad to fuck off because he was a troll. 
So, it's not so black and white is it? I've tried adding to the community, I've done a fair bit of coding work and try and be pragmatic. And in saying that I now see you'll blame whoever doesn't pump your agenda/opinion.
If it's not trolls it's or BCI, or the mods, or Ben Lawsky, or Buttcoin.

Dogecoin repaid hack victims and tip g was community spirit. This tipping is all driven by wanting mass adoption and conversion of shills.

Where did you buy Fosters in Australia btw? I don't know anyone drinks it here. Maybe let me know when you hunting crocs with a knife?

I say this because rational means having plans to realise a goal or at the very least disagreeing for a reason and providing a rational alternative. 
If it were libertarianism people would not have been up in arms over the Gentoo "debacle".

Well said. The entire Bitcoin ecosystem has a very bad public image and this is why. Whether or not Bitcoin directly facilitates scams is another matter, but the shady business practices that everyone turns a blind eye to are a major problem. It's mind boggling because everyone seems to think because it's a Crypto-Currency there's no laws. Tell that to the Altcoin pumpers (cachecoin indicted) and the Bitcoin *.io* domains.

BTC ain't dead. But I really don't want to discuss price so I'll just end by saying I don't think BTC is ready for the competition from its "partners"; and for the record I used to use Doge as my de facto Crypto-Currency due to the superior fixed price it had before the Altcoin Armageddon Abortion plundered the investors everyone is pissing and moaning about not getting on board.

As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
- boring grey in colour
- not a good conductor of electricity
- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose
and one special, magical property:
- can be transported over a communications channel
If you redact "over a communications channel" you end up with depleted uranium...
 
-Satoshi Nakamoto
[Dave Seaman]( discussed this quote on his podcast recently. 
It's a nice reminder that Satoshi was well aware that Bitcoin is not necessarily a unique invention, since useful technology such as the Blockchain can be integrated by companies (and are, Blocktech Group is doing this already).
Bitcoin is only as strong as the network. But to assume there'll only be one network and to call anyone thinking otherwise a heretic, well, Satoshi knew it in 2010.

Astronomical in what way? If the current climes are stopping breakthroughs - and they are - why not migrate to something which is more capable of scaling? I don't see Satoshi as infallible. He dropped the ball on centralised asic mining, so that's a big variable he missed, and as such, it totally changes all his other predictions. The assumption was each person was running a node to keep the network going. There's no change at doing so ever again. 
Major issues needing fixing:
* scalability
* wasteful mining
* centralised mining
* lack of a cohesive dev team with a respected mandate to adapt for

You're surprised?! This is going to get much worse. Obviously it's headed this way since PayPal requires compliance with NY laws
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:09:32


PayPal has nothing to do with it. He "bought" Bitcoin, didn't get a TxID or anything, and that got him scammed. He didn't sell Bitcoin and get scammed by chargeback. He bought from -in his own words - a total newb with no credibility and waited days to complain to PayPal. I can only think of one reason why someone would be so desperate to get BTC so quickly and without diligence first, and it's not trading
In fact, it's his only chance of getting his money back.

It's a very polarising point you've brought up, as some feel it's the solution to all the banking ails while others say bitcoin is not equipped to become the mainstream method of money transfer. 
Bitcoin is as useful as people believe it to be. I personally think there's a lot of potential but it's not a panacea. 
If you're not talking about investment to get rich quick (hoping price will exponentially increase) bitcoin is fantastic. Once you bring profits and investment to the equation then no matter what anyone tells you, you're gambling.

That's *your* opinion. Everything that you say is wrong or retarded isn't necessarily so.
Plus, it's far from impossible. If the value of a blockchain is worth more in profit than the cost of setting it up, then why wouldn't any company use the blockchain technology if it's profitable? 
I respect we disagree. But the guy isn't retarded or wrong. Nothing is that simple. 
I think it's a bigger stretch to say the blockchain will always be limited by bitcoin's constraints. Ripple and Ethereum have found a way to do it

Again, I appreciate the reply! 
I certainly see your point and you're right. This alone is nothing in the scheme of things. 
I'm more concerned with the cumulative effect these things have though. 
To me the blockchain is a certainty. Bitcoin still has a fight. As regulation rolls in Reddit is basically targeting TBF - that to me is at odds with good outcomes. I don't know if it's hardcore libertarianism or pseudo-libertianism (ie acting like it becausei it's "expected") but the infighting and such isn't good. We certainly need a somewhat unified front.  
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:58:27




It's bizarre, I know. The community isn't shrinking, they've moved to where it's less about vicious attacks and name calling to better sources of information. StackExchange is best for tech stuff, as is Zapchain. Bitcointalk is halfway between Reddit and SE. Twitter occasionally has info. There's good podcasts but they're made by ppl loathed by the reddit btc community.

Or there's the less batshit insane possibility between those 2 fringe theories: a person is educated, not a shill, and chooses - based on rational thought - not to back Bitcoin as the future because perhaps Bitcoin is MySpace and Facebook cometh.

Don't feel sick over these things. Its good you are insightful to acknowledge the greed. Personally, I'm never content myself. The closest I get is from doing what I love, not buying shit for FB cred or so people envy you. Anyone who envies or only appreciates you because you're a millionaire is not someone you want.

I think people are missing Andreas' point; **distributed consensus blockchains allow for more than just currency** - these debates about too much information and "how do I search it all?" Thankfully this didn't stop the Google from being introduced to take advantage of a new, revolutionary network; just like email isn't the Internet, blockchains aren't Bitcoin. It may be based on the protocol but it's:
1) not wrong to profit from fantastic innovation
2) not mutually exclusive that it's Bitcoin or nothing

Because changetip doesn't use the Blockchain as a public ledger, i can't imagine this makes things "better" in the eyes of the law. The Charlie Shrem trick could be employed (sending BTC thru closed-ledger Txns) quite easily since $50 is the limit. 
Either changetip is 100% covered (not even 1% insolvency) or the tips are just virtual tips not covered by Bitcoin. If the latter, then the govt will chase them down for tipping funds not actually there. If/when everyone tries a mass withdrawal of funds I'm 90% certain (from history) that not everyone will get what they're owed.

On the flip side, if this were a hack for $5000 of OP's Bitcoin it'd be gone. So there's a happy medium. The bank *wanted* to take the $5000, but the law stopped that from happening. None of that applies when a hacker somehow gets your private keys. While I'm not a big fan of the pull over push system (ie direct debits should be a direct request for *pushing* the payment, never *pulling* the money from your account) there needs to be some recourse to the finality of Bitcoin payments.
Most here will disagree. But the average Joes feel this way too and there's no getting around it with education short of making sure every consumer has bank-level OPSEC.

Jesus tapdancing Christ.
I lost out with MtGox back in Sept of 2012. I saw the red flags and stayed away.
If you don't own your private keys, you don't own your bitcoin. If MtGox has your private keys, then frankly, you're either ignorant or greedy (chasing the elusive 20% premium MtGox BTC rates).
This bitcoin ECONOMY is an economy. The dogecoin community compensated their members in full using donations when a wallet service got hacked and/or went rogue. I'm sure everyone with such pity for the MtGox investors will donate to cover my $2k (or 145BTC at Sept2012 rates) loss as well as all the others?
OP; you hedged your bets like everyone else. If you missed the warning signs (ie MtGox not functioning as an exchange and showing every indication of being run like a damned Chinese firedrill) you have no one to blame.
Do I feel bad for the MtGox investors who lost their life savings? Yes. I feel as bad as the people who lost their homes in the sub-prime real estate collapse of the late 2000s. It's investment. Goldman Sachs and MtGox and other big companies go bankrupt. The difference is MtGox never had a veneer of professionalism and once alternative exchanges were available, Magic The Gathering might not have been the best bet. 
Take some responsibility.

I mean this in the nicest way, but isn't that smug? To say "the economists don't know what tulip mania means, but we do". It's extremely smug to assume everyone else is wrong and Bitcoin is right. The tulip mania analogy is employed because of the sheer mania that goes on in the community. You're right it's not comparing apples with apples but comparing irrational arguments for wanting "valueless" objects at inflated prices is spot on. The only thing that can change that is growth of startups and work. 
I'm learning how the Bitcoin protocol sends transactions and I've gotta say, it's a clusterfuck. It's all over the place. In essence it's fucking beautiful, but much like the beauty of the human form it's nasty inside and extremely complicated. If you're not familiar with some of the issues stopping mass adoption (limits per second on transactions for eg) get acquainted with them and help development push forward.

If you spent the time you did making this pic instead *learning something valuable* about BTC, which would be best? The fact this has 60+ upvotes and I'll get slammed for this... well, it sucks. Because I know a lot of people who see the front page of Reddit and think Bitcoin is a vicious cult.

What a surprise! A personal attack and name calling in the Bitcoin subreddit!
Have you got no class at all? What sort of person uses an AMA to chastise their employer for their own shortcomings. You don't need my approval, do you? I'm sorry if you're offended. I don't set out to belittle anyone. You think because you're anonymous you can take out your bottled up arrogance and anger on the Internet. Well, you're right. No one is stopping you. Not just you in fact; 50% of this subreddit is filled with some of the most inane, childish shit I've ever, ever seen... **this guy is fighting Bitcoin regulation**. He's the expert and all you people ask is the same thing over and over again.
I appreciate you teaching me a valuable lesson; I'll be walking away from this place because I'd wind up as angry as the rest of you surrounded by negativity and self-denial until one day I'd find myself hating everyone and everything.

Spot on. I'm glad you replied because the frustration stems from no one wanting to entertain the possibility of a bad scenario. 
It does come across condescending but I'm certainly not here to gloat. 
All this talk of the organisers being scammers now just destroys all credibility; everyone is happy when it's positive news but if it's not good news people viciously attack anyone and everyone. 
That's the sentiment that puts me in a defensive position. I put myself in these college kids' shoes (the ones organising the grants) and think it'd be bearable to try and fail and learn from it. But to try and fail and be brought before MIT to defend against what certain people are sure us a scam? That's the kind of thing that will ruin bitcoin.

Happy to help. 
I think the best advice I can give anyone is to start small. I say this because I've lost (irretrievably) bitcoin to wet phones and incorrect transfer (ie transferring to an address I thought I held the private keys to but didn't).
If VPN is your thing buy a1 week trial at  for example. 
Otherwise get a blockchain.info wallet and be sure to use 2 factor Auth
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:02:08


Oh yes, only Altcoins will ever use blockchain technology. Cmon. Andreas is fully expecting banks to use this technology, side chains are here. Miners are fickle people, so assuming a large corporate interest wanted a POW Blockchain secured they could offer greater reward (more diverse, ie better initial rewards, more predictable awards, etc etc) for mining their corporate POW chain. 
The fact that Bitcoin isn't a corporation and it's only lobbying group (TBF) is panned for being opaque is mind boggling because the certainty is Blockchain technology is the paradigm shift, and Bitcoin is an app of that technology. If corporate interests want Blockchain technology, they'll get it.

Ohhhhh, now the word of the banks is good? Unbelievable. 
OP, how are you certain you're right? If you can't argue that Bitcoin is not pyramid scheme, don't you think that's the problem? Everyone is so sure of Bitcoin but not a fraction of a thought goes to "maybe it is" or even "yes, it could be". It's this dogged reasoning that turns so many people into doubters. Why take the word of people who won't entertain an opposing viewpoint? It's fundamentalist thinking and it's a blow to any rational thinking person.
Give your dad the facts. The fact that most of the Bitcoins already mined are held by a very small percentage of people should probably be addressed instead of glossed over. If no one can give you an answer other than "the banks say so!" or that your Dad doesn't know what a pyramid scheme is, I'd say you may want to ask the question.
I'll chime in myself. It could be, yes. In many ways it appears to be, however the dynamics are a bit different.

This is fantastic! Thank you guys/gals. 
It's tough out there to be in Bitcoin. Think about it; learning a complicated hodgepodge of backwards hex values and zero tolerance for txn compilation, all to bring a service/business to the masses who aren't even sure why they need it.
My vision for Bitcoin is dependent on these rough edges being smoothed out so there is no broken Altavista links or limited availability on dialup modems; because that's where we are now. We're not even Windows95, we're just past Win 3.1.1 (MS-DOS being the complicated hodgepodge to the mishmash of APIs running today's apps). 
Teaching people about Bitcoin will be incredibly useful, and, rewarding! First hand feedback on what prevents mass adoption helps guide development. And on that note, consider the developers like Gavin and Andreas who are incredible positive role models. I will be buying Andreas' book to support his tireless lecturing and speaker engagements. And if that pushes the book up the charts where the mass market finds it, then it's win-win.
I'll leave it with a great quote by Satoshi, perhaps aware BTC would face competitors (all the more reason why development must proceed):


- boring grey in colour
- not a good conductor of electricity
- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose


- can be transported over a communications channel

@_date: 2014-10-25 03:10:15
I think there's a misunderstanding on how this works. It's fundamentally using the proof of work consensus for other purposes, be it trading or commodities. There's a reason Andreas is backing this (the same reason he left BCI IMO): because side-chains will be the future of finance. 
The only difference between this and Facebook slaughtering MySpace is Bitcoin's Blockchain is integral to the functionalities. 
Whether or not corporate profits are there to be made... I'd certainly hope so! Because I can't see much funding going into "a libertarian commerce experiment" (as Bitcoin is described). 
There's nothing wrong with companies making money from side chains; it's going to be a big part of whether Bitcoin can adapt or not. I think it can if people keep an open mind that what we have now (with Bitcoin) is going to be no less than the difference between surfing the net in 1995 and using the net in 2014.

Of course. I thought you were trolling. I'm sure others agree because I'm not in the minority here.
We're past the initial price spike. I'm not an economist but I see in altcoin trading everyday people expecting a return like some of us (me included) made on our 2012 investments. The point is you may believe the price will go up 10x and make you 10x whatever you hold in Bitcoin right now, but by hoarding BTC you're just hanging onto BTC that can otherwise be used to grow bitcoin. 
I have savings in BTC too (minimal) but I also use BTC to buy things... VPN access, goods, services etc.
There's a big difference between price and value. We're at a stage where volatility finally has plateaued (again, see graph).
Save BTC if you must but spend it as well. You can't expect everyone else to do the hard work right?

I sold $10k of BTC when it was $120 to pay for chemotherapy then watched it go to $1100 knowing I would've been worth $300,000 more had I never spent BTC since 2011. If you hold and so does everyone else it is just everyone waiting to get rich overnight. Money ain't everything

I don't misunderstand. They sold it for fiat when the bust was evident. That's what the volume shows and we know they're capable of it because they're serial scammers. Do you think they didn't know this day would come? They liquidated whatever official BTC they had. So if it's fiat, I'm not misunderstanding am I? I think we're just not seeing eye to eye on whether the money is still in BTC or it's been converted to fiat ... I say the latter :)

What's wrong with you? None of this is too extreme. The article argues we need to stop pedophiles using Bitcoin to buy child porn. Instead of getting all angry people can suggest alternatives to banning btc. It doesn't help to slam an article like this. Why? Because it's just as easy to quote your post and say you're in agreement of not doing anything to combat child porn. The default argument is always "the reporter is an idiot. He got X wrong and Y is bullshit." 
Right. So what do we do? Stick our head in the sand and pretend this won't be an issue that needs to be addressed? It'll come up time and time again and we need something entirely more helpful than personal attacks.
Perhaps email the author and clarify the points you dispute. Educate the journalist if they're wrong. If you don't plant the seed in their consciousness who will? Easy; Andreas or someone else arguing btc merits in front of a committee like yesterday. Different situation, yes, but it's a very similar regulatory issue.

2. Because the careers are laughing so fucking hard and are too busy with all the hookers and blow they're buying!

It's condescending, it's vicious, and it's the sole reason I'm out.
So the arguments of Bitcoin being so revolutionary it can't fail (or "too big to fail"?😀) may have been true, but it's a moot point now; the image Bitcoin has is well deserved; full of vicious, misguided, condescending, shady people.
You want people like my dad to adopt Bitcoin? Don't call him a troll when he asks questions (this happened in and he now **hates** Bitcoin). The torch gets passed to the younger generation, but the damage for Bitcoin due to bad PR and infighting will prove fatal.
I'm out. I'm glad I'm out. And I can't help but laugh at the material Buttcoin brings to light. Sure, Buttcoin has a biased viewpoint, but Buttcoin has proven equally capable of entertaining an opposing viewpoint and being rational.

Why is btc not better stable at a price like now than it is making everyone wonder what the price will do next. This to da moon thinking is stopping mass adoption as much as lack of development skills.

Yes, *they* are building. But building what? More nodes? Running $450 million worth of VPS Bitcoin daemons? Mining to secure the network? Buying actual ฿? 
No. They're buying the Blockchain experts for the technology it can deliver! PayPal didn't dump eBay to team up with Bitcoin. In fact, the article with PayPal's CIO quotes him saying they're observing to adopt the technology to better suit payment processing. 
I'm really blown away people cannot see BTC is in trouble because the tiny dev team for BTC is so splintered there's no chance of an alliance to stand up against the PayPals of the business world. It's not a certainty BTC will succeed now that corporate interests can effectively take the p2p network which gives BTC value and offer better incentives to miners! In fact, the whole ฿=$10000 was never certain because it required incredible demand. That demand is being rationed out in front of your eyes. 
But correct me if I'm off-base; if miners are incentivised better to leave BTC why would BTC be special? Satoshi didn't think so either fyi.

What a genius idea; change the most popular web wallet's name because ... It's less confusing? Or another instance of the community's ever present need to vilify *everything*? 
This post and all the complaints about BCI and coinbase and bitpay and The Bitcoin Foundation do more to keep away the noobs than anything else. In case you haven't noticed, the bad image Bitcoin has has basically permanently destroyed all credibility and promise. But the incessant complaints are what sells the bad image to noobs.
Just the fact you're complaining about the most popular web wallet because you don't like their name proves this point; why would any noob consider Bitcoin as viable when supposed supporters are always finding fault? I'll say it again, **how can any noob have faith in Bitcoin when the community is consistently complaining and vilifying everything concerning Bitcoin?** 
Bitcoin is dying and the only thing that the community does is continue to lash out. It's working well; but not in the way you're hoping.

Sure, if you're drawing private keys randomly to steal, that's true. But the human factors make 1 far less safe than a true random number.

@_date: 2014-10-11 08:55:46
Depends on which kind of transaction I'm making and what function I'm needing from the protocol. I can't only use 1 code because then I'm pushing the input transaction hash (surrounded with the bytes for various thing like version, varint number) onto the stack without checking if it's identical to the public key input.
But this is confusing for a 5 year old don't you think? :)

We're talking about NSA bribing core devs, I thought? I meant, how can that happen when the repository **is open source**? Everyone was talking about this *yesterday* regarding the Gentoo issue. They control the repository, but how can an NSA bribe change how open source git commits work? We both know the answer; it can't.


What the fuck has this got to do with anything you said before? Now you've moved on to how much cache they have with the community? If you've built your exchange around v0.9.1 it's not off-the-shelf; it's customised often-times and from what I know from roll-out projects, you upgrade when necessity forces your hand.
I can't follow this at all. The thread is titled "in the spirit of transparency" which you said was not true. 
If you have problems with the BTC Foundation I'm happy to hear it. But these are wild allegations; that the NSA is bribing the dev team? To do what? 
Do you think the devs are millionairs like the Winkelvosses? They're not. I've got a couple issues with some of what the BTC Foundation has done (mainly the Mt Gox debacle) but competence isn't one of them.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:18:06


Yes, moderation would be the answer IMO. Stack exchange and work very well but it's a different forum and impossible to moderate 140k members here, so it ain't gonna happen, which means more proactive people are needed to step up...


And it won't be me - here's [my last effort at attempting to help the community]( 3 vicious people replying testing my knowledge before not taking up the ELI5 offer, another saying fuck off, and the end result? A negative post count for offering free tutorials/community functions! So yeah, you probably understand now why I'm a bit defensive after going into this trying to better things and being slammed for donating my time. It's viciousness just for the sake of it and I can't see how there's any fixing that when its revolving around ROI.


Yep. While 140k people fight over this crap we could be signing petitions, organising our social networks to get pro bono help, deciding on community issues and getting some resolution, planning for the hardships and not scaring off new blood.

It's a massive problem. When AMA guests get abused or anyone in the media writes about Bitcoin or if someone mentions ApplePay, or PayPal, or anyone asks a question someone doesn't like, its the same thing: name calling with no input.
It doesn't bother me personally because I know Redditors are people who call rape victims liars, and dox "bad guys" who end up not being the Boston Bomber. But newbs; if you were a newb and you said things weren't easy enough to use you'd probably not want to be called an idiot because "it's easy". 
I'm happy I found as its similar to StackExchange and Zapchain. 
I actually tried to set up a tutorial/ELI5 to help people and got asked what the point was. With little interest I glanced up and saw it had been voted down and just thought, fuck it. Why bother donating time to a bunch of people who know everything? As far as I'm concerned, I'll see what's happening here because it's a good indicator of how *not to do things* and where things will crack when the pressure comes. 
If the best thing people have in their life is putting other people down then I'd have to think the outcome is going to be well deserved. $10000/BTC? Don't make me laugh! Most of the people with any thoughts of investment get scared off from here immediately. Mass adoption? Many think we're already there. 
Nothing wrong with disagreement. Or being wrong. But assuming your opinion is the absolute truth is as helpful as attacking core devs and the mass media. 
A community run by abuse and down votes but devoid of any opinions is never going to persevere. Let's hope these regulatory problems just go away. Don't let Bitstamp closing anonymous accounts fool you, everything will be fine. It's peer to peer, it can't fail? Oh, **how many here run a node fulltime**?. How many remember e-gold? How many remember Apple steals any technology it wants and makes it easy to use?
This isn't going to fix itself anyhow; the loudest are always the troublemakers and you can't moderate everyone. Knowing everything is great for never learning anything else. 
And it's not libertarianism-biased here; libertarians have opinions (pro-tip, "you're an idiot" is technically an opinion. Back it up with your own theory/disagreement and then you've learned to debate like an adult.)

I saw this in Zerocoin and thought I'd chime in on the question, which is a good one, by the way. I couldn't poke a hole in the logic either until I realized the nodes aren't networking at speeds comparable to data centers for large hubs like the Atlantic seaboard for example.
Here's why part-time is not as effective as full-time nodes. The uploading/downloading ratio is entirely incidental to the way nodes work in this context; namely because your client keeps a list of nodes it "knows" are able to relay information. 
Yes, you're certainly sending out more data, but it's the info your peers missed in theirs or your down time which isn't being validated and getting consensus that is problematic. Another say to put it; it's not the uptime, it's the reliability that misunderstandings can and will be communicated. 
A good, familiar analogy; torrent downloads when it's filled with peers but not enough seeds. 98% of a video isn't good enough for a torrent. In a very similar way, that is what is happening here. The lack of incentive (meaning lower node numbers) exacerbates the issue, yes. 
Whoever brought up miners just needing UTXOs is problematic moreso than a helpful feature would be my opinion too. Miners are greatly incentivized already to secure the network, but the hash rate of pools makes their contribution *somewhat* more important. I'm not up up speed on DRK supernodes but if they improve P2P relay efficiency/functionality then it's a pretty cool idea. That being said, it's a DRK thing, not a bitcoin thing. 
But hopefully the torrent part is the take home message here... Or anyone using Kazaa/Limewire remember the clusterfuck that was p2p file sharing at its most fractured. And painful!

Thank you for *disagreeing with a response*. It's great we can disagree on this like adults and everyone is better for it. Is it true that reasonable discussions aren't here any more? 


I'll clarify/modify that a bit; the "to the moon" mentality is extending the development time at the least, and at worst could do much worse. A few hypothetical questions and you tell me how likely or unlikely you think it'll be:
1. How many developers do you think there are representing the huge community/userbase spending and mining Bitcoin? So % or actual numbers, either is fine...
2. When journalists (WSJ, FT, Fox, Time) are verbally abused by community members because of their opinion and are called incompetent, how do you think that weighs on Bitcoin for negative press and possible withholding of positive press in future?  
3. Development is hampered and stretched over longer time periods from total lack of community input. Whilst people complain about the bearwhale or worry about the price, nobody is having discussions about anything. So how do you get input for development when no one answers questions? 
4. [Verbal abuse of core development team members]( over rumours/news, complaints of any development with a different brand (Ethereum, Counterparty, Reddit currency, Overstock etc); hero-worshipping figureheads (Andreas) and [making scapegoats of developers]( of all types when BTC price dips

There'll always be naysayers but this isn't religion; journalists can be "converted" IMO. All it takes is a dialogue.

Not a surprise to be honest. The image certainly needs to be improved. And the culprits? No, not shills or Buttcoin. No, it's the rabid attacks against anyone who speaks "out of line". Nope, it won't be the banks taking down Bitcoin, it'll be the community itself. The last 12 months are the most hateful, spiteful times I've witnessed in my 4+ years following Bitcoin. 
So while everyone argues over The Bitcoin Foundation transparency or core developers altering software or technicalities in CoinDesk/WSJ/FT, it's entirely possible this behavior is not appreciated by anyone ever, anywhere.

That should have been the response to Ver getting on the cross again. None of this should've been aired publicly. There's fault on both sides but the support for Ver is disproportionate to the problems he causes. An exchange brings value, unlike Ver

Short of rallying the community to help fund these guys there's not much that can be done than wait for funding to increase the dev team resources.

You don't expect 20-40 Petahash/sec of mining hashrate taken offline to effect the difficulty? How do you figure everything will be ok when the assumption is Bitcoin will always prevail?

Also, the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated for good reason. Americans don't have thalidomide babies because the FDA made the right call.

People don't care. I'll say it again.., people don't care. They live in better conditions than any other time. Ever.
Furthermore, ppl don't care how their money works. They want it to work. They don't want to be losing huge percentages to volatility. 
Bitcoin is not a panacea.

So you've got nothing to add? 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:17:14


You've made the assumption I don't care about Bitcoin. Many "trolls" do. There's no harassing going on that I can see; perhaps some examples?
And yes, the problem is everyone is fine with celebrating Bitcoin in its successes but is never willing to discuss problems. That's what this "trolling" comes down to. Labeling people trolls does one thing: *it sidesteps having to deal with tough questions because the person asking them has their intentions questioned*. The only reason this troll problem seems so huge, I feel, is because *you're hearing things you don't like, don't have a response to, don't want to know the response to, or all three*

@_date: 2015-01-30 20:46:05


His point is Trezor changed the license and he doesn't like that. 
The only reason they floated the open source shit was because there's a community filled with people demanding it and Trezor basically compromised until - lo and behold! - it wasn't profitable researching hardware so a competitor can manufacture carbon copies (same usb # and all) and cut into SL's operating costs.
Dipshits like this guy think SL should operate at a loss in the name of open source. And the best part is the fucking guy had and has no intention of being a customer! So, great! It's awesome to hear these diatribes on the importance of licenses because it's such an important feature (think of all the successful open source hardware companies who turn a profit! None? That's right)

All of these "long debunked" problems are EXACTLY the problems no one wants to discuss. They are real issues. They might be debunked in your mind, but they're not solved.
So I don't see why discussing these problems in a forum is so terrible. If the community spent 1/50 of the time it spent on witch hunts and troll spotting actually discussing solutions and their implementation there'd be a lot more solutions to fix these issues.
There are major problems like CO2 emissions, Txn rate (~4Txn/s), and an average Txn cost of [$13 / Txn](
If bringing up these questions is trolling then what you're asking for is no debate, discussion or anything but good news. Irrespective, trolling is not that.

Funny how most of buttcoin, me included, got into Bitcoin in 2011-12, sold after the peak (usually at $750ish), and now feel relieved not to be a part of such idiotic simplicity. Buttcoin actually has real conversations. Real debates. 
Sure, it's a laugh hearing über libertarian fanatics but the funniest part is you're wondering why there's problems with Bitcoin in the price department: let me tell you... **bitcoin has problems because any difficult question or voice is downvoted, ignored, called a troll, and usually all three**
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:18:33

I'm not talking about average Txn size. I'm saying why would you use on chain Txns at ~$15/Txn for gambling when you can use the bandwidth for better uses? It's like having a computer send an email every second to tell you the time.

I can literally name 60 things that are wrong with this idea but at least you had the sense to ask first instead of coming in and telling us how you were fired for "no reason".
Even taking money from the register to make change for yourself (ie $50 ==&gt; $20x2 + change) is a definite no-no because then if the register is short, you're to blame.

The guy who ran off with ~$70 million in BTC from sheep marketplace in Nov 2013 cashed out through BTC-e quickly enough.
Investors do OTC sales. A 50k BTC dump is either accumulated hacked BTC from the past, a group of people cashing out, or, most likely, those in the know have sold and the effect is being noticed having positive feedback. 
Also, it just so happens these cloud miners need to cash out their BTC before bankrupcy. BFL did it. I'm betting it's a combination of all.
The price is going sub $200. I'd be prepared.

You'll eat those words, my friend. While honorable to stick up for Bitstamp in some ways, in many, many other ways, we all know shit isn't right here. 
There's no plausible reason why a hack of private keys couldn't just have the system rolled back and new keys created. The constant delays are an extremely bad sign; this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
And to those who disagree and think I'm too hard on them... Lemme ask you: **do you think this shit is right? Do you honestly believe Bitstamp has handled this *well*, or is it they've *not* handled it as badly as MtGox,** methinks the latter :/

I feel what you're saying -and I'm in partial agreement- is Bitcoin is an interest of yours, and therefore coding Bitcoin is more likely to stick. It was for me. Most Python apps I've coded are Bitcoin based.

@_date: 2015-01-15 17:46:34


Right, I know the difference, and I don't necessarily agree with the sentiment, but if you're not writing for arstechnica or wired you're not defining the plethora of jargon for people reading a print newspaper article. I understand we differ in opinion here, but picking on high-level concept descriptions to cast doubt on the journalist and his ability isn't a fair tactic. Now, if a journalist said, for example, "Australia has koala bears" in an article about Australia, that's fair; they're not bears. But in an opinion piece where a lot of these definitions can be half-true it's not, IMO, so simple as saying "miners aren't middlemen"; they are in a traditional sense. Just like Bitcoin has Ponzi properties. Shades of grey
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:02:28

Yes, and do you think ASIC would've gotten a better reception? "Oh, the journalist is using jargon to confuse people!"
It's this arguing about word definitions and such which does nothing. The article dissects the crash very well. Why get caught up on little things instead of reading the article as a series of interpretations with truth in there. It's never as simple as right or wrong and writing off an article because a journalist misuses a term like supercomputer misses the forest for the cellulose making the bark of the outside of part of a tree

I hate it when the busted lock the burglar broke is a load bearing lock which is intertwined with the paint, furnishings and utilities of the house. In fact, recently I had my car stolen and the stereo was ripped out. The car started but I decided it needed to be replaced in its entirety. It's just good business fundamentals.

People - regular people - want exchanges/banks to limit thefts in a way not unlike a cock: the most acceptable situation isn't limiting anal penetration with phallases to small amounts... The only acceptable situation is limiting being fucked in the ass by a cock. Period. Consumers normally don't want cock in their ass. 
Bitstamp has jammed a cock in every ass and, amazingly, the crowd applauds for being so gentle and not using the whole cock. To me, being fucked with 5.1 cm of cock is not to be applauded when there should be NO COCKS FUCKING ANY ASSES AT ALL. 
Now before you call me homophobic or gay, just know: *i don't condone raping with cocks*. **do you?**

*we need more engineer types like Satoshi to pull great concepts together into realized user focused products*: the reason shit got done back then (and I was around then) was because Satoshi **did all the commits themselves** (ie Satoshi hardly ever let anyone make changes)

You're assuming that it's known 100% this is a scam.


What about this:

* perhaps offering a service like webhosting
* seems legit, based on a quick Google
* annual fee paid... 
* then they stop answering emails and I've been scammed 
**That's on me?**
To clarify: we're not talking about a *triple your money in a month with this one weird trick* company/scheme; I'm talking about just standard products most people don't think twice before buying. You're saying it's OK to scam people and that they're the fools for not researching whether the company were scammers?

The point seems valid, right? If these was an issue allowing 10 billion BTC to be made, what stops another issue cropping up again? Open source doesn't cut it because no one here codes or can understand the protocol well enough to assess the code. That's not a condescending statement either: the protocol is ridiculously convoluted and the team of devs number in the low single figures worldwide.

No, the problem is that the community is all ideas. Do you know how many people understand the protocol well enough and work on exchanges? Next to none. You've taken it upon yourself to single out one exchange, yet your solution is...multi-sig? 
Do you know how multi-sig is implemented? What effects it has on txn time? How long migration takes? How well tested the multisig framework is? Whether it's cost effective?
Tell me you're informed enough to not just be doing the usual *oh, here's another idea, it should be so...yesterday* ... Because there's so many ppl who take the time to point out "obvious solutions" when there's no understanding of how much of a clusterfuck the protocol really is.
Just for the record, are you saying multisig was/is an option not employed due to laziness/malice/not caring/incompetency?
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:00:57


Care to share why it's wrong? I can't tell because there's no data, no methodology, no dismissal of the Shamir *et al* paper; seems your opinion is meant to weigh in ahead of doctorates in their field. The fact you've invited brigading is possibly the lowest part.

*If* the banks have that kind of power ... why/how is their omnipotence going to waver and give way to this new banking paradigm you feel is coming? 
I'm trying to understand how you believe this and why Bitcoin is going to be a panacea (if that's what you're implying)
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:12:18




Right. So not having people run a node isn't a centralisation issue? It is. Nodes have bombed in number and it's got a lot to do with the blockchain size. And isn't decentralisation meant to rectify these issues? If people don't want Gentoo tweaks (the whole point if Gentoo) then they won't be used. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:39:34
Annnnndddddd....? 
Past performance is an indicator of future performance? No.
How about this.... **why don't people actually DO something to improve Bitcoin?** 
perhaps all the mining companies, exchanges, etc folding are more an issue? Because the price is going nowhere with no infrastructure. 
It's never going to $1200 again.
It'll rise in price, I'm sure, but it's a fair assumption that ever since the price peaked above $120, Bitcoin was over-valued.
@_date: 2015-01-28 11:57:29

No! There's a lot of people who get immunity and it turns out decades later (DNA evidence for example) that the star witness was the culprit. That's why you get mob hitmen looking for people in protective custody or witness protection
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:19:27


No, we're well past that. The majority has heard of Bitcoin through the media and either investigated it, decided otherwise or not investigated. Half the coins are mined. You can't even mine with a CPU like you used to. It's well passed early adoption,

No no no no no... I've gone over this before. New generation BTC miners melt steel down and then use the ambient heat to drive underground stores of CO2 into the atmosphere, whilst harnessing a pinwheel for mining. Alternatively it runs on burned books. It's free energy.

One of the few. Nice work.


Concerning moreso.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:28:07


Never. You know why? Because as Bitstamp has shown, you can be totally incompetent and make empty promises, with no recourse whatsoever. Why? Because the community (some, at least) are applauding Bitstamp! They're congratulating Bitstamp for not fucking up as badly as MtGox! Will Bitstamp's reputation and business suffer: clearly not. Will Coinbase's? Nope. Because for all the platitudes about reputation and trust, nobody has a choice. If Bitstamp and Coinbase die, Bitcoin probably will. So people will accept treatment *a la fiat bank* with all the hypocrisy that goes with it because if they don't, Bitcoin will fail.
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:05:41


You're not a very friendly cynic! Not sure if you're aware mate, but I've tried running tutorials for this community, ELI5 sessions, etc etc: I've tried my hardest with this place and it's always the same thing. Call me a troll.

Smart man. Yep that's the standard I was thinking of.
The problem there is a timing attack, so while their code gets the results right it just leaks through a sidechannel what the private key is.

It's the people who run the exchange. You fuck with them, and you may end up dead. They're the only exchange that has no known owners, offices etc: how do you have fiat payment processors even integrate with that exchange? 
BTC-e isn't insulated from failing. It'll fail when laundering funds through the exchange becomes unprofitable. The reason they have fiat conversion services there isn't for customers, if you catch my drift.

9/10 most used addresses are gambling related. That's why on-chain gambling Txns @ $13 / Txn are a horrible idea
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:42:32


Maybe the fact that you're not even paying a $0.04 Txn fee is why there's issues (in part). The average txn cost is about $6/Txn. If you think txn fees are an issue, the block halving in ~August will be even worst because the price MUST double (and we don't know, or even expect, it will)

This is the biggest misnomer I've learned through literally years of learning about Bitcoin. 
I'll give an example. 
Big Endian and Little Endian are used seemingly randomly in raw Txns. Big Endian is bytes written like this: AB CD EF (which seems sane to me), whilst Little Endian reads AB CD EF as EF CD AB (bytes reversed, hence read from little End).
Now, you make a txn referencing where your old coins came from, ie the TxID. Blockchain.info and every other blockexplorer uses Big Endian. The protocol though... Little Endian. So you take the BCI TxID and reverse the bytes! Why? Who knows! 
Oh, and value in Satoshis is Little Endian. So forget that, and use Big Endian and you've spent a fortune.

Yeah, or Satoshi is a team of people and Kapeles was one of them. I don't think this is the case, but assuming it's one person who made this is folly. The hodgepodge of little/big Endian values, DER encoding, appended bytes, signing a rawtx with substituted values for scriptpubkey: none of that points to a person with a preference for a certain way to do things. It's clearly an amalgamation of roles. Case in point: the integer overflow issue would never have minted the billions of Bitcoin if it were one person coding the project.

There are but that's not the issue that was raised (and promptly down voted): why is it ok to argue for Bitcoin but not discuss areas where Bitcoin lacks and needs improvement? If there's no discussion or recognition, then there's certainly no impetus to fix things.


I feel what you're getting at is *the price has bombed since then and no one can figure out why..., so trolls.* People were euphoric at the Microsoft news and even now there's still no realisation as to why Microsoft accepting BTC thru BitPay is bad.

You need to get over Buttcoin. The truth is its a group of smart people for the most part with huge issues with a crazy minority here. I know a lot about Bitcoin, I share my knowledge on stack exchange, and Buttcoin isn't all about bringing down Bitcoin;  it's about satire (laughing at crazy libertarians), serious discussions also, and in general, a group of people disillusioned with the way Bitcoin is run by the select few. It would seem for the most part ideals are well aligned.

Right, but all it takes is ONE instance of using an exchange without mixing and you're easily traceable.

People, stop with this audit bullshit, please!
Every person here hopefully has a good enough gut instinct, such that we all know an audit will make no difference to this situation. The shit has sprayed across the room and the fan is flinging around more shit, meanwhile. Bitstamp are burning hair to distract everyone from the shit storm.
Let's be realistic. If Bitstamp can't be proactive enough to do this kind of thing themselves, then demanding an audit sure won't help. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:15:07


Yuck. I agree with the browser route 
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:02:56


Sure, but the stock market isn't proportionally losing huge amounts. Bitcoin is losing price at an accelerating pace...
**I'm asking for rational people who want to discuss this.**
If you want to discuss this, chime in. If you want to keep talking about trolls and Buttcoin and such, no need to reiterate the same discussion.
My theory: Bitstamp has triggered price declines which mining companies knew would hit them prior to exchange reopening; the declining price accelerates losses of companies, companies fold quicker, and the positive feedback loop strengthens.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:54:34

What on Earth does this mean? A "pure" Bitcoin solution means nothing. 
The impediments aren't made by the bank; the impediment is put up thought the fact that people can't earn or pay standard charges with btc. What's a pure Bitcoin solution that could work around this issue? Honestly, there isn't one and talking in "oh, it'll get figured out eventually" is unhelpful imo.
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:09:06


One way would be to make an exchange that abided by rules and regulations and was run properly and didn't have Phil on TeamSpeak relaying insider trading denials. Also, there'd be a lot less hacks, disappearing funds, and all around, transparency. Every exchange currently out there deserves to be destroyed. They're all a big friendly group of charlatans pulling the same old stunts again and again without recourse.

@_date: 2015-01-08 13:57:34


Excuse the skepticism, but the last audit was in May 2014 and we're taking the exchange - not the police/authorities - on their word because....exchanges have such great reputations they don't need to prove anything? So there's been a half dozen casualties (Hashie, VoS, Cointerra, etc) this week alone but it's not an arsonist or a problem: in fact, if the pesky people wanting proof could shut up then Bitstamp could concentrate on their own internal investigation. 


Good to get an insight into why Bitstamp should be congratulated for being robbed. Incompetence and fraud at MtGox is bad, but incompetence here is good I'm being told. You're basically saying there's nothing that can or should be done other than let these guys handle it. And if, God forbid they fuck up, then how were we to know they were lying? After all, what could possibly suggest Bitstamp were not on the level? Identical red flags to Gox? 
I'll tell you. You can stop enabling shoddy shot like this. And I'm not suggesting the exchange be closed down: that would be an extreme measure after all. Oh, Bitstamp shut the exchange down? So if we use a break and enter analogy here: why shut the bank if the lock just needs replacing? And if there's rumours of nefarious deeds, why not quell the rumours with a report? You say they don't have time to do both, and I agree: that's where the professionals (authorities?) come into this. Who the fuck wants the team who dropped the ball to be back in play when it's clear they're out of their depth?

Why do you think I want to discuss price? I only want to discuss price in that everyone is talking about and missing the causative factors, perhaps? I would be overjoyed if Bitcoin went back to the stable $100 marks, to be honest.

Oh, I missed this part. I have a better understanding of what I'm up against now... So it's not about the points I raised, it's about "them" stopping Bitcoin being traded? So basically, as I said...

Then how, just how, are you making the judgement that you'll support it bc it's decentralised? Decentralised isn't a desirable property across the board: hell, try downloading a torrent that's not seeded instead of a https exe file via url and tell me which you prefer.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:13:08


Because there's *shades* of ponzi/pyramid scheme in the way BTC is distributed. It's not a straight up Ponzi, but it has similar properties, which, while you may have good intentions, are doing no favors; least of all your family.
You're so certain you're right about Bitcoin succeeding but you can't be any more certain than anyone else, homework or not.

My point - admittedly unclear😀 - was that perhaps the sale isn't going to be made on price alone. Some customers/clients adopt on affection for fan base preferences and I'm tipping this is closer to the truth here.
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:19:18


Can we stop with the "technically it's not BTC" platitudes? And namecalling? raises a valid point and throwing around ad hominem attacks is the same old reaction, time and time again. 
The day that there's some concern for these issues I'll be pleasantly surprised. 
If the truth be told, Bitcoin would be doing a lot better if these and similar issues were faced instead of avoided. The only steady agreement is in attacking difficult questions, and that's not right.

Oh, like TradeHill? They were a BTC exchange who had $100k stolen. As in dollars, fiat dollars. This was in 2012 and would have been the equivalent of ~25,000 BTC; luckily because it was dollars it wasn't a BTC exchange hack which people could've learned from. 


Exactly. Bitstamp are clearly very smart in their ability to placate investors and make small fiat hauls like TradeHill's seem amateurish. Bitstamp, MtGox and every other exchange has marketed itself as being like a bank in all facets except fundamentals like compliance, fiscal security, and solvency. 
Bitstamp are actually delayed, I'd assume, due to laughing themselves into a state of disbelief at victims of the hacked BTC are defending the exchange for performing so well relative to MtGox.

You're right in saying that, I'll concede. However you're assuming that there's a benevolent set of self-governance which will stop this from happening. The greed wins every time, based on what the years have shown us in the Bitcoin space. 
No, not all Bitcoin businesses or exchanges are scammers: nor do I think those that do wrong set out to do so. But that doesn't make it OK, nor does it make the few bad eggs' "crashes" acceptable. Regulation may not be the answer but the current Bitcoin solution is worst than regulation in that there's no recourse whatsoever; where else could CruptoDouble thrive with not even breaking the law?  
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:20:47


My sentiments exactly. While real issues are around - probably the toughest days in awhile - THIS is what you think about. Is that all that matters to you guys? Getting rich from Bitcoin? While there's ECDSA, Txn volume and unconfirmed Txns banking up to be discussed, you're winning the lottery. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:43:30


This is just...ridiculous.
You need to understand that the fight doesn't take place on the Internet. There's no plausible way of maintaining the Great Firewall Of China. The limiting factor will always be cashing BTC into fiat currency. So there could be a satellite for ever person, but if all the banks and your government have made it illegal then it's not happening when other options aren't illegal or blocked.

You're getting downvoted too. See? This is why I like Buttcoin. There's actual discussions over there.
Here's a tip; accusing everyone of being a troll is a nail in the coffin. 
You've got several options with newb posts (which, shock!, may have a newb account!):
1. Ignore
2. Don't tip. You're not forced to
3. Call them a troll until they prove otherwise 
4. Be like any other community and be helpful

@_date: 2014-11-27 09:39:29
Yeah, I know where you're coming from. I was just assuming another straw man argument, so my bad. 
I think whenever the private keys are in another person's control, the temptation and/or lack of security preparations will ALWAYS be the prelude to disaster. 
It's not just MtGox. The proportion of "hacks" or "losses" or outright scams since 2010 is exceptionally high. Why would this be any different? It's impossible to say. 
My opinion ... Eschewing all bitcoin's strengths for a centralized service which holds onto your money but has no recourse if it runs away... That's bad

This is disingenuous, no matter whether you've added "short term": no one can say Bitcoin is more stable than the USD. And for that matter, pointing out issues/flaws in fiat/USD/Euros/whatever doesn't in any way mean the opposite is somehow true for Bitcoin. 
And FWIW, I think price stability is something that is very helpful for Bitcoin. People seem to think a bubble is a good thing.

Do you understand how this all works? 
1. The devs write code, open source. Any malicious exploit would be caught nigh immediately (like the integer overflow error which made 120 billion BTC out of thin air)
2. Miners in collusion with a sizeable percentage (it need not be 51%) of the hashrate **can do anything they like**, 
*eg, they could wind back the chain, they can reject transactions, double spend transactions, block transactions, or if the miners are in bed with the Chinese exchanges (highly likely), then insider trading can run rampant.*

Yes, but the miners go where the money is. If the network forks, the miners choose the profitable chain. And no, the majority of miners are not pools of users: some Chinese mining farms account for 3% of the total hashrate, and they're not run by users.

Bitcoin took off when the gawker article mentioned Silk Road. There is a strong correlation between illegal activity (buying drugs, especially); just because it doesn't sit well with you doesn't make it untrue.

Nailed it. Once Bitcoin replaces dollars and such there'll be no taxes because Reasons. Also, war and famine will not exist because Reasons. It's very simple: just upload the Bitcoin source code to the Fed mainframe - just like on ID4 - and Bitcoin will rep,ace dollars. It's that simple. Money is the root of all evil, therefore if we change the money, everything else will fall in line: just like how the Templars argued that prohibition of alcohol would do away with child abuse, rape, domestic abuse and sin in general.


who is "they"? Is this a conspiratorial "they"? Corruption is part of human beings. You can replace it with Bitcoin, but I fail to see any signs from the last six years that Bitcoin is immune to corruption and such. So it's basically "they" need to go, and Bitcoiners need to be the new elite because Reasons.


Bitcoin is **a public ledger** FFS. This "fiat and bankers are evil, therefore Bitcoin is the answer" argument is so wrong. Bitcoin won't end wars and famine and taxes and somehow end corruption: it **might** have a hand in ending the drug war. That's it. If you really believe that Bitcoin can stop every evil because Reasons you're a fool.

Right, and it's lucky we don't live under that regime. You don't pay taxes, you go to jail: no execution, no beatings. There's a law and order system in place and society requires taxes. You can hate taxes - I do - but I don't call it rape by a totalitarian regime who steals the fruits of peaceful labour. You want to live in first world society: you pay taxes. That is, if you can afford to. If you're not earning enough, you can still live in the first world society. My government pays for healthcare for everyone.

There was also the huge (~20%) arbitrage between mtgox and the other exchanges. So when average price was calculated, the value was either heavily weighted towards mtgox' inflated price, or in cases on localbitcoins, it was a 10% markup on **just the mtgox rate**.

No, it's not. If you do the math for the electricity prices that Chinese miners get ($0.008/kW) then that's where it stands, around USD$205. Sure, there might be enough profit to tow the line, but like over time they will have equal losses which makes the position untenable. 
The exact same thing happened when all the non-Chinese miners started going belly up: the reason it happened to about 10 at once is because that was the BE point for the cheapest electricity prices which aren't in China.

The whole payout to account holders **cannot** be fair if the mtgox records don't exist, which I'd wager is the case.

I still have the records though of making the actual cash deposit, and that's probably going to be the benchmark for proving your losses

It's not the change that is the issue. It's the way people are enacting that change. Bad behaviour like we've seen recently, all to show you don't do censorship? 
Hodlers consistently find a scapegoat whenever the price isn't headed to the moon: the primary reason people want this block size increase is because they think it's holding back the price, and apparently the mods are in on that. Now the price drops, clearly it's Theymos's fault again. /s

You're assuming that people all have the same political leanings as you. Most people don't want to take the system down, because the system provides them a comfortable first world lifestyle and they understand that taxes pay for society. You hate taxes? Me too! Everyone hates taxes, mate. But they're not going away because Reasons. I can't think of a quicker way to make Bitcoin a target than positioning it as the currency which will unseat governments and end taxes: that's not what Bitcoin is about and it certainly turns many people away from ever using it, because believe it or not, not everyone thinks Bitcoin will end corruption

You seem to misunderstand, mate, bc A-B tests test between choices, A-B, whereas the UI skewing results, as you suggest, would be equally likely for both (cancelling it out). The Bitcoin option wasn't disadvantaged. It was the same UI, and it's randomly assigned, so any variation you argue is accounted for in the stats
You're thinking of having a completely different UI for one and not the other, which isn't how these tests work. Companies like Mozilla use these tests **all the time**, but you're saying they misunderstand the concept? Um, ok.

This is incredibly disingenuous:


Bitcoin has to keep UTXOs forever, whether or not the UTXOs are spendable (ie sub-dust value, `&lt;547`) or represent lost private keys. 


Blockchain's decentralised ledger is incredibly inefficient compared to the way Visa does things. You've absolutely got this backwards.
Bitcoin is never going to take over Visa. 
*The best use case Bitcoin has is something Visa can never ever do and never will do:* **allow DNM-type purchases**.

This isn't anything new. In the 90s there was restrictions on cryptography so that browsers had international versions and U.S. versions, where the former had 40 bit encryption. The laws were repealed, but the FBI have always maintained strong encryption should be restricted.
@_date: 2015-08-13 08:14:51


It's BIP101 which has the specification.
Numerous BIPs have been run in the same manner: miners sign the coinbase field of their mined block with their preference; for BIP12, miners chose between BIP16, 17 and 18; BIP16 won, which is why we use `P2SH` for multisig instead of `OP_EVAL`. 
You'd certainly remember BIP66 (a BIP62 offshoot), which enforced DER signatures (and caused the fork last month): BIP66 outlines exactly what the voting criteria is.
So for BIP101, it's going to go with miners' votes (in their coinbase field of the block); the specifics are/will be in BIP101. It's possible, like BIP12, that 2 or 3 contenders will appear. 
**Miners are the voters though**
It has all changed from when I first got into Bitcoin; back then this sort of community disagreement could be settled much easier because the community could actually have their vote heard (as everyone ran nodes).
Is this good? **NO**. I am not strongly for or against the block size increase, however, 
I adamantly believe that nodes - **irrespective of whether they're mining nodes or not** - should be given a voice by vote. But, that BIP hasn't been proposed yet 😀

Yeah, someone sitting on $600 million is driving the price up higher. Some people don't give a shit about money. What you just said makes no sense: as soon as the coins move the whole thing will collapse. I doubt anyone here would hold Satoshi in high regard if he cashed out $100-$600 million and got rich, while everyone hodling watched the price of their coins decrease by **at least** 10%


He could but he doesn't even weigh in on Bitcoin stuff and hasn't for five years. The option is still there to do this: why isn't it done? Because Satoshi obviously doesn't care about Bitcoin anymore. You couldn't care about a project and just walk away.

From the BIP65 doc:


As an aside, note how **if the SignatureHash() algorithm could optionally cover part of the scriptSig the signature could require that the scriptSig contain CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcodes**, and additionally, require that they be executed. (the CODESEPARATOR opcode came very close to making this possible in v0.1 of Bitcoin) This per-signature capability could replace the per-transaction nLockTime field entirely as a valid signature would now be the proof that a transaction output can be spent.

Right, if you use sighash_single, it signs the input/output pair at a given index. But let's say you have 2 outputs and one input: if you sign with `single` at index 1 ( since indexing starts at 0), then the signature jus signs the value `1`. This allows one to take that signature and use it with a UTXO to spend it.

@_date: 2015-07-10 09:39:04


No they can't. If you want a secure wallet where you're also buying Bitcoin to put in that wallet, and getting the guarantees provided by said service, you're absolutely going to be using a highly compliant service like coinbase. Even BCI in its heyday never allowed purchase of coins. MtGox was the death knell for wallets/exchanges combinations skirting regulatory bodies. No one should trust a service that won't comply because there's zero recourse if it goes under.
Coinbase certainly does shut down accounts with nefarious transactions, but that is absolutely not going to change if people want a service that provides low risk.

That's really, really selfish IMO. I've had radiotherapy covered by the Gov healthcare system, which taxes pay for. Part of living in a functional society is paying taxes. You can't just opt out because you disagree with taxes: everyone hates taxes. But like death and..,taxes...it's an inevitability.


The whole world runs on the dollar/euro/etc. 


If Bitcoin replaced dollars tomorrow you can bet taxes would be collected. Anyone who honestly believes Bitcoin will spell the end for taxes is deluded: Bitcoin has zero chance of getting anywhere if it's attached to tax dodging. Bitcoin has great use cases with DNMs, remittance and such, but even then, it's not a situation where you can expect to get away with whatever you like *because Bitcoin.*


1. He's an economist. He understands taxes are a necessary evil
2. Bitcoin runs on a public ledger; it was never designed to circumvent taxes.
3. His point was Bitcoin isn't a currency because you can't pay taxes with it: **FWIW I disagree**. Mainstream adoption certainly means towing the line with regulations
4. Taxes aren't going away
There are a lot of moderate voices in who understand that taxes are never going away: just because people think Bitcoin has use cases which don't include tax evasion doesn't make the person "a tool"

Satoshi bailed on Bitcoin 5 years ago. And while no one is certain why, I would argue it's because **Satoshi's vision was "1 CPU, 1 vote".** In the past 3 years nodes have dropped from an all time high of **60,000** (June 2012) to ~6000 at present. This is the complete opposite of Satoshi's "vision". Furthermore, Popper recently shared an email where Satoshi showed displeasure at GPU mining: everything went to shit when ASICs came on the scene, so I can only imagine the displeasure at what things have become. 
You have to wonder why someone who believed in their vision so much would disappear at such an early stage; the fact that Satoshi has never weighed in at all in 5 years tells me that vision died a long time ago. 
**If Satoshi were so invested in this vision, then why can't he/they chime in on this block size issue?**

The sooner Bitcoin owns it's use case - to wit, DNMs - the better. Bitcoin will never be able to compete with the PayPals and Amazons of the world: conversely, **Paypal and credit cards can never be used for DNM-type sales**: that's a huge deal.

That conversation was about GPU mining, as you say. The quote really spells out that Bitcoin is an experiment and there were no considerations for ASICs or GPUs, and certainly not mining centralisation.

I agree. There was Cypress supposedly driving the price and the backlog and fork - both bad news at the time - seemed to suggest price rising was not in line with any logical reason.
China basically runs Bitcoin trading: it could very likely be the start of a pump before the dump, as that would make sense in terms of this spam making trading difficult. Hell, it could be on the way to $1000. I guess everyone needs to remember that 2013 had the same conditions as now and when it peaked at USD$230 (~AUD$300 at the time) it bombed to $70 before the backlog allowed anyone to react.

I don't know how they do it, but recently a Silk Road vendor was selling personalised discount vouchers, which were essentially fraudulent codes. The same logic applies to gift cards: they've been stolen (or not paid for) and the card will be flagged as stolen as soon as you activate it by trying to make a purchase. 
**Selling Bitcoins for any reversible payment option - Paypal, giftcards, whatever - is incredibly risky**. 
I mean, it's even better than these guys trying to offload the cards for cash, because with cash, you've gotta meet up, and then there's a chance they'll get arrested. With Bitcoin, all bets are off.

Right, but you or I have no idea what tomorrow brings. And that's why I'm trying to clarify what the benefit is here. Why take the risk on the volatility? Or better put: do the benefits and risks of holding Bitcoin outweigh not holding Bitcoin?

Right, but Bitcoin was made with "1 CPU = 1 vote" in mind, which stopped being the case after ASICs were used for mining. **All it takes to make the limited supply worth nothing is &gt;51% of the mining power**. I find it very hard to believe there isn't collusion between the symbiotic Chinese exchanges, mining pools and traders. We can have the rational actor debate, but this is a huge issue now more than ever before.

Or ask why they don't trust an anonymous computer programmer who bailed on the project 5 years ago.
If OP asked some pertinent questions **and listened** to the replies, it'd be immensely more helpful than this "with us or against us" mentality.
Ask open ended questions like:
1. What have you heard about Bitcoin?
2. Do you see a place for Bitcoin?
3. Why/why not?
4. What concerns do you have about Bitcoin?
Asking these sorts of questions leads to discussion. In fact, the questions go both ways. If you're in favour of Bitcoin that doesn't mean you are above logic in rationalising your support. And to be clear, arguing "banks and fiat and government are evil" is not in any way arguing for Bitcoin: tearing down the "opposition" doesn't make Bitcoin legitimate. 
You're never ever going to get someone on board by saying "bankers are evil" if **they** don't care about bankers being corrupt. (And yes, FWIW, IMO bankers can be corrupt). Not everyone shares this "unique" world view of "fiat and politicians are evil whilst Bitcoin is the panacea".

Bitcoin would do a hell of a lot better focusing on strong use cases like DNMs and such ahead of taking on the credit card behemoths.

Are you asking for specifics or implying the banks have problems discerning anomalous transactions? Either way, banks use an algorithm to flag suspected fraudulent transactions. If they miss a transaction, you tell the bank and they refund you.


[heres how they do it in Australia](
If the bank's systems detect what they think is an anomaly, they contact you to check. If they do not detect an anomalous transaction - like your $50 Amazon purchase - then you tell the bank and they refund you. 
I had a $1500 of charges made on my card while I was in hospital for a few weeks. The bank tried to ring me, but I missed the call. I eventually returned their call and they refunded the money and allowed me to go back ~6 months to dispute charges. There were none so it didn't matter.

Bubbles are not good. In fact, if another bubble comes, there's always going to be losers in that, because holding coins at peak value and selling is different entirely. So assuming it pumps in price - which I think it will do to a degree around block halving - then who is buying the coins you're selling?

Society moved past the precious metal peg. Bitcoin has too. That's why the Digital Age is fundamentally different than the Stone Age, or the Bronze Age or the Iron Age: because digital currency and trade has *substituted* for those archaic precious metals.

Not solely directed at you, I'm baffled why pegging to a precious metal is necessary for these digital revolutions.

I'd compare Bitcoin to something where you don't need to lie and make disingenuous claims just to provide what we already have. Bitcoin is an experiment and it is a success in that it proved the Blockchain can work. No one is steering the ship. No one is coding, no one understands the tech, and it's a hotbed of scams. 
**The only good use case for Bitcoin is DNMs**. That's not bad, per se, just the truth.

Likewise, my preference for vanilla ice cream rules out chocolate being a flavor. And because chocolate is no longer a flavor in contention, it is only fair to assume that chocolate is inferior.

I believe you may be confusing what goes on here as healthy. It's not. No one codes or even makes life easy for those growing the ecosystem, latest egs being Trezor and Mycelium Entropy. There's a litany of anti-capitalist platitudes about Bitcoin being the world's saviour yet all anyone cares about is getting rich. There's nothing new there. 
The primary use case for Bitcoin is DNMs, which is fine, but the DNM ecosphere is entirely unhealthy, and there seems to be a very strong correlation with DNM health and Bitcoin's. 
Honestly, no one does Bitcoin any favours asserting its a panacea for the world's problems, nor asserting its unable to be stolen or that it's free and instant. It's disingenuous, whether you realise it or not: no one is going to trust Bitcoin when they're told here in it's going to save the world, because that feels like setting the bar really high and is bound to fail.

As well as the language barrier, there's also the fact that US traders are asleep by the time the Chinese start selling off.

‪&gt; * The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members' participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group (for example, lying to family or friends, or collecting money for bogus charities).


‪&gt; * Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group.

No, we don't. It's been that way since their inception. The whole point of BTC-e, and why they suffer so few hacks, is because they fly undercut he radar by design. BTC-e has always been the exchange to go to with stolen Bitcoin, as Evo recently reminded us. My hunch is they pay pennies on the dollar for "tainted" coins. But no, there's absolutely no concrete information on BTC-e admin's, other than rumours of being Russian mob.
@_date: 2015-04-18 14:42:55


No, I don't believe so. There's issues with a disappearing arbitrator, bc then the 2 sigs required to release funds must be used by buyer and seller, and the issue is why would you sign off on a transaction paying either the buyer or seller ONLY (bc Bitcoin reqs spending the entire output)? Also, they have to trust that the recipient would follow through on whatever agreement was decided (ie a 50/50 split must be sent to vendor or buyer, and the vendor/buyer then is trusted to send the 50/50 split instead of keeping the full amount).
Also, the DNM BlackBank has set up escrow which *looks* like multisig, but the notion that they can release funds immediately with a special code means the site has setup multisig off-chain, or they've done a `2 of 3 keys OR just a masterkey`. I think the latter, since they only accept compressed keys (scriptSig space limits).
Also, it's ridiculous to expect escrow agents to offer free service unless they arbitrate. Furthermore, requiring an arbitrating party at all is essentially PayPal anyhow.
There's no clear solutions in multisig, because assumptions are based on "good actors"
@_date: 2015-04-18 14:54:02


That makes no sense whatsoever. Why does it always have to be disparaging comparisons between cash/cards and Bitcoin? Use an apt analogy.
1. People don't "support" cash. 
2. People don't "support" credit cards. 
3. People use both because they're ubiquitous.
4. Bitcoin supporters who are 100% for "no chargebacks" unless it benefits them are hypocrites. 
It's actually worse that people can't balance two points of view (not everyone); you don't need to be 100% for chargebacks or 100% against them, to the point of making ridiculous analogies. It's entirely possible to admit chargebacks are helpful sometimes, sometimes not, than it is to be a 1000% uber-hyperbitcoinisation stalwart.

You specifically say you purposely circumvented trade restrictions, and now you're wondering if you've broken a law? So you came to to share an "anti-climatic" $35 transfer story and you're wondering if there may be problems with living in the Middle East and using Bitcoin to purposely trade with Israel because obviously trade restrictions doesn't mean restrictions on trade, it can only be a figure of speech like when someone says "that's against the law", it actually means "the law applies to other people".

The assumptions are that it will happen again because it happened before. I can't prove or disprove either a for or against argument... What I can tell you is the landscape is very, very different in 2011-2013. No one really knew about Bitcoin. You could still mine it with GPU. The price never really went too crazy, so it was mostly tech people.
Now, everyone has heard about Bitcoin (whether they know more than the name is a different question). You can't mine as a hobby. There's a lot of people not using Bitcoin (ie not spending it). But I think this is the biggest factor: **the DNM scene has become unhealthy**: the biggest driving factors in past bubbles were MtGox trading bots and DNM growth.

it's not broken. Your experience proves that. If you'd lost your Bitcoin what would happen? A lot worse than being annoyed by the bank because they need your account info to match to your lost card (seriously, **if you forget your account info, realistically, how can the bank help?**
I've lost my card overseas and had a new one within 36 hours. In Thailand. 
This disingenuous assertion that "the current CC system is broken" is **ridiculous**. It works incredibly well. And no one is crying out for an alternative. Yes, "there's technology that works", but the implication that Bitcoin solves these problems conveniently skips over what doesn't work in Bitcoin. **With Bitcoin you're on your own**. 
EDIT: I want to add, I do see a place for Bitcoin. It does very well for DNMs, for example.

I really hope you're the louder minority, because it'd be sad to think that the majority of Bitcoin supporters are using "I want *not that*". Why? Because you reach a goal by saying what you *do* want. Focusing on what the credit cards do and ttearing down their real world use cases doesn't help Bitcoin. Quite the opposite. And it certainly doesn't harm the banks. 
A more pragmatic approach, which I'd urge everyone to take, is to *pick your battles*, and, again, *aim for what Bitcoin **can do***. A hyperbitcoinisation mindset is not rational bc Bitcoin will never ever, ever replace these legacy systems. If you recognise that you can start looking for where it can be beneficial.

I don't see how you come to that conclusion. There is a great assumption that all Bitcoin proponents are operating as honest participants. Take the Ghash.io 51% mining issue: it was more profitable for Ghash to **not** turn away customers but it had to because it was getting too high in hashrate. This is also assuming miners in the pool will move away from the more profitable pool to benefit the network
The protocol is fantastic in some ways, but it's not a panacea. And it's certainly hasn't found a way to make honesty more profitable: because rigging markets and such may not be what Satoshi designed in the protocol, but it's a fundamental example of unfair play being more profitable.

As for 16 (plus expiry/CVN) numbers on a credit card, it's nothing compared to the 33 case sensitive letters in a Bitcoin address, and before you say "use a QR code", there's nothing stopping that for credit cards either.

I can understand frustration at Buttcoin because it seems like it's a hoard of rabid anti-Bitcoiners, which is not the truth. There's a range of people, but the most common Buttcoiners are people who know a lot about Bitcoin because they've been involved with it since ~2011 (like me).

There's a fee. Zero fee is misrepresenting that.
Also, ask yourself *why* they turned down the Bitcoin: it's because a known, flat rate with a familiar service backed by assurances is nearly always preferable to an unknown, variable cost with no assurances using unfamiliar processes.

I'll do what so many are having issues doing...answering the questions directly, without parroting "go to Bitcoin.org and click FAQ" (like you didn't think of that, FFS):




Avoid these apps. God only knows what sort of bloatware is installed with this kind of app...I know from past experiences that &gt;60% of Android Bitcoin apps are a combination of useless, resource intensive and scams, the only variable is the proportion. This doesn't apply to legit apps like GreenAddress wallet etc, and IME its doesn't apply to iOS (though there is a Bitcoin roulette game on iOS that lets you gamble but Wong allow withdrawal, which is the kind of shit all these android apps do)


Try [BTC SE]( I've got no idea mate, ditto for 


`100,000,000 satoshis = 1 bitcoin`. So to convert from Satoshis to BTC simply multiply by `1E8` (100 million)


So, `6E5 / 1E8 = 6E-3` BTC (= 0.0006 BTC)
`0.0006 * $236.36 = $0.141816` (Google Bitcoin exchange rate, $236 is the value in USD$)
So 60,000 Satoshi = ~$0.14
I really like the [zeroblock]( app for iOS/Android for checking prices and conversions. It's free but I paid the $1-2 extra for colour charts, as it's a great app and deserves support. **Support good Bitcoin apps like this, PLEASE DO NOT support the Android miner/gambling apps** (uninstall and rate as the pieces of shit they are)

You know, many people have this exact idea. The problem is there's a dozen developers with the skills and Bitcoin tech background to make things happen...a dozen when it should be thousands. I don't doubt the price will pick up around 2016 for block reward halving but there's some mining issues which need hashing out (no pun intended), namely whether half the reward will cover expenses. I certainly can't say with 109% certainty Bitcoin won't hit $200k, but I think it's fair to say there's a 99% chance it won't get that high.
@_date: 2015-03-27 10:17:14

That is the issue. If you can't get the vendor to sign (assuming you can even contact them!) then you're both not getting the funds. Also, there's no compromise.

@_date: 2015-03-18 07:48:26


No you haven't misunderstood it. It's the most complicated Bitcoin "solution" and as such *no one uses it for the most part*
Fyi, there's 2 types of Multisig:
1. P2SH (peer to script hash) has addresses starting with 3. 
2. Redeem pubkeys directly (the script engine will push this format: `OP_0 OP_m 0x21 compressed pubkey 0x41 uncompressed pubkey 0x41 uncompressed pubkey OP_n OP_CHECKMULTISIG` where OP_n/m is representing the m-of-n part. The maximum standard Tx is 3 of 3
Multisig doesn't solve many problems. It also has brings problems:
1. The scripting engine doesn't know if a P2SH Tx is wrong. It's a hash of the Tx so forget...
2. Don't forget the op_0 (empty null byte for off by one error) lest you make the Tx irredeemable 
3. Like PayPal, a 2 of 3 Tx *is still arbitrated* **Edit** an eg: in 2of3 if the vendor and admin both sign on a Tx you dispute (ie never received), then the Tx has been arbitrated to pay the vendor/admin (sadly it usually goes this way when a vendor uses their good reputation to "prove" they're in the right)
4. Multisig doesn't automatically mean funds are returned: forever unspendable yes, but it doesn't mean disputed funds will be returned
5. Unless you're coding the raw transaction and distributing the pubkeys etc, you're always relying on a third party to provide the GUI. look what happens when the GUI disappears: 
Also re 2of3 Multisig: **how do you contact the vendor to sign a Tx (you both need to sign) and trust said vendor to refund for an order you never got?**
Here's the reason Multisig hasn't stopped this problem: *multisig is far too complicated at this point in time*. It's very easy to say "oh Multisig is an option" but in reality the underlying raw Txs and such are incredibly limited in scope and hugely complex

That's just it: Bitcoin is an experiment with POW, and in most instances it's a success. However the arms race that is Bitcoin mining certainly doesn't seem to be in line with *"one CPU, one vote"*, but all that aside, the fact remains that the Bitcoin scripting language doesn't allow the complex functionality Ethereum (by design). There's still only 6 types of *IsStandard* BTC Txs whereas Ethereum seems to solve this.
I don't see the issue really: Bitcoin won't be the only solution since it can't do everything everyone wants. If Ethereum moves forward a certain functionality that cannot be achieved with Bitcoin that's good news, I'd think!

I read it all! Some great points made. 
Re: rebuilding the scripting engine from the ground up, I think that's the whole point :)


Yeah, it's very abstract. I'm certainly familiar with the issues posed by oracle Txs in the Bitcoin network and the workarounds required (because otherwise a miner can intercept the info and spent it themselves if it's a simple puzzle). So I'll have to read up about limitations more.
Am I understanding this point though?: that *besides Eligius mining pool the Bitcoin network won't relay non-standard Txs* 
I know smart contracts is very abstract, but it certainly seems like functionality on par with what BTC testnet offers should be the bare minimum for the btc mainnet.
Re crowd funding development funds; I think it's one of the few projects that isn't VapourWare i.e. investors invested, the devs used the money accordingly and there's code, testnet etc to prove it.
Thanks for the info though. I'm not choosing one over another, but I certainly think an open mind for these initiatives is best.

Number of nodes is ~6000. Two types of nodes:
1. Full nodes (like I run) have the full Tx database indexed, using *txindex=1*
2. Nodes have just the Tx database relevant for one's keys/UTXOs
Obviously the former is more valuable. 
That being said there's no real incentive to run a node, let alone buy one. If you care about the Bitcoin network or want to play around with the protocol it's great though

This. If you've ever associated your IP address with a Bitcoin payment, which is highly likely given most Bitcoin newbs aren't running a VON TOR node, then it's quite easy to link identity to BTC Txs. This isn't even really a debatable point: it's been shown time and time again the best btc provides is pseudo-anonymity. 


Yep, they do this is Australia and they do it well, as you know.
I don't see why people feel the need to argue that Bitcoin is:
* instant
* free
* anonymous
When none of those properties are completely true. It's not instant, it's not free and it's not anonymous. That isn't to say Bitcoin doesn't have benefits, but selling Bitcoin on the above three properties isn't truthful.

I can vouch for this. Having worked directly in hardware and support for eftpos payment network and the pinpads, I know first hand having worked for a huge chain here in Australia, that chargebacks are negligible. The most a single business has ever had is 5 in a year. They were a huge problem and they eventually left the company. Most franchises had one, zero usually.

Oh, so you might donate with all that? Great, will you maybe be donating a huge amount to offset the lost donations?

How much would sales need to be to outweigh those cons?

No mate, [a full node]( has the full UTXO index database. It requires the txindex=1 flag. The default is to only index UTXOs relevant to your keypool.

Interestingly enough, the genesis block's first Tx is not indexed, so trying to query  will not work on a full node since the genesis block is by definition unspendable, and therefore isn't in an UTXO indexing

Technically correct doesn't always translate to correct. Like Bitcoin wallets are technically Bitcoin key-chains; but expecting the terminology to be technically correct in this instance isn't the crux of the discussion.
Also, Bitcoin is secure if you don't use it. There's a litany of security issues which have to be acknowledged, and given the lack of insurance, that's certainly "tricky".
@_date: 2015-03-29 06:20:13


This attitude is ridiculous. You don't care enough that Bitcoin succeeds most days and then go on to say it'll shake up the establishment. The question that remains is why ambivalence is limiting your convictions to actually grow Bitcoin in a productive way, eg coding or learning to do so. 
Even if there were 100,000,000 subredditors with fervent beliefs of Bitcoin dominance, **it doesn't change the manpower behind development**. In fact, judging by node counts things are getting worse and the pressure is not going to be carried by a dozen coders with exemplary skills AND intimate knowledge of the protocol.

Right, I get that. But certainly you must acknowledge that this link is quite prominent already? It's not a matter of "if" regulation sees things this way, because it's already happening. 


Again, I'd argue that the association has been made long ago: Bitcoin is seen as a shady method of payment BUT *acknowledging the facts is the best wag forward*.. 
Honest question: do you think not acknowledging the connection to criminal activity is helpful? I don't. It's quite simple AFAIC: by admitting Bitcoin is not fully anonymous and also acknowledging criminals use Bitcoin, it's a simple matter of responding to overly restrictive regulations by saying; *"What's the problem with criminals using Bitcoin if the technology allows for tracking?"* That can't be done if the neither the link or pseudo-anonymous functionality is acknowledged, right?

No. A 2 of 3 signature situation with a customer, vendor and arbitrator, is always going to have the arbitrator sign as the deciding vote! 
For eg, I'm a DNM customer. The vendor says to the market admins he sent the package. I disagree and won't sign off on it. 
The vendor and admin sign 2 of the 3; **it's been arbitrated against me in this example**
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:03:29


Me too. I called TORMP, SheepMP and Atlantis as scams because it was clear the admins were in it to get rich only. BMR was smart in that the admin saw the heat was too great. Silk Road was the end of it all really. Silkroad2 didn't even offer escrow IIRC and the scams are consistently high value so it won't stop happening. 
I do feel for people who owe bad people lots of money but I also know that the dangers are known to all how fickle these marketplaces are. It's not like Silk Road in 2011. We're 4 years down the road and you all have to admit *its more noteworthy when a DNM* **doesn't turn scam** *rather than vice versa*: and that's saying something.

That's a small issue compared to:
* PseudoNode "proof of concept" (of something or other) wreaking havoc
* why SPV won't cut it
* why running a node is everyone else's problem
With ~6500 nodes running worldwide it's not hard to use pseudonode to get 10% of nodes at all. And this seems poorly done, since it's all traceable to the one source. Probably a test run for future exploits where it's far less obvious the nodes are all malicious

How does a 51% attack work? 
Also, the Germans and English will argue pretty successfully torrents are effectively killed. Also, Chinese and Russians can't legally use Bitcoin in all instances. So sure, it's not dead, it's regulated though
This "nothing can kill Bitcoin" hubris is completely uncalled for. Bitcoin is never going to topple the establishment. If you think that you're a fool. There's possibly a complementary place for Bitcoin, but it's not replacing the banking system, nor is Bitcoin such a threat it's going to be attacked and killed off.

Ok, but what about *now*, ie today? I'm curious why people don't see this as a very simple and effective way of supporting Bitcoin that anyone can participate in.

So you're saying that accepting Bitcoin requires a proposed payment to use it and you need to educate people on the system? Recent changes in Australia (worldwide?) where you must use your pin for a credit card were hard enough yo educate people on, and don't even get me started on the chip cards. This is tech they use everyday and it's hard to get off the ground. Why in god's name would anyone want to educate everyone when the standard payment system does the job well and requires no education?

1. Losses with Bitcoin occur at the human to network level. This is comparing pineapples and oranges. 
2. IMO it's completely misleading to call it the fastest computer in human history, because it's not a single computer, but a network, and the network is run by ASICs, so again we're comparing apples and oranges.
People don't care how their money works, they just want it to work. Bitcoin works, but without consideration for the negatives of being your own bank, people don't have a compelling reason to move across from where they are already. And TBH, these half-truths don't help, IMO

Shallow? The post has **6 sections including methodology with calculations to back it up**. I'm not even weighing on whether I agree or disagree with the post, but calling it shallow and saying it's "hating on changetip" is unfair, at best, IMO. 
I applaud you for actually running through the points you have and responding in turn, but getting annoyed at this kind of thing is unwarranted. 
Before I knew about Buttcoin I read about BFL buying a site which was basically satirising the whole BFL business-model. It turns out it was a Buttcoin blog telling people *[ Onion)-style* how huge the problems were with BFL. BFL bought the blog in a nefarious manner, then proceeded to change the bad press. And when shit hit the fan later on, everyone was questioning how it could happen. **Holding Bitcoin businesses to the same standard as any other business is NOT being negative**. If someone provides links, allegations and deductions in a rational manner, it's not trolling. It's part of a healthy community.

That's not very helpful. How can you assert btc escrow is the future if you haven't used it before?
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:05:39


You nailed it. This is exactly what will happen. It's the perfect opportunity to pump the price because everyone is expecting the price to jump. Many people will get burnt by this. 
As for data for the last block halving, it's difficult to correlate that with this block halving because of Bitcoin was a completely different beast back then: firstly the price didn't move much until after the halving, secondly ASICs were just coming into the market, and finally, most sales were going through Mt Gox which was manipulating trading data.
I don't have a crystal ball, however I am quite adamant that irrespective of the outcome, there'll be a huge pump at block halving by pumpers and self fulfilling prophecy.

Introduce me to someone who actually uses the Bitcoin paid for a project without stealing the btc and disappearing and I'll be equally impressed. Ethereum has real promise. It's got a great scripting engine which complements Bitcoin since all the interesting smart contracts and such use non-standard Txs which aren't relayed by standard nodes. So Ethereum certainly offers greater flexibility in that regard. How useful it is remains to be seen but it's moving at a blistering pace compared to other projects in the ecosphere.

If it were **40% extra** for cash money ($) then that's *sort of* implying what you say. Offering **a 40% discount** for Bitcoin is the opposite of that. Any rational human will look at the BTC price and think "Bitcoin is worth pennies on the dollar".

Correct. P2SH and P2pkh are both great space savers. In 2011 MtGox lost thousands of bitcoins by sending to p2pkh `0` which is irredeemable, so it makes sense that this is an issue given that if you make a Multisig script incorrectly (which has *a lot more room for error* given public keys have to be in order etc) then it's irredeemable. I'm not sure why we're disagreeing: are you saying it doesn't make sense bc it hardly ever happens or something else?


Well, it's a foible if you are used to writing raw transactions like you and I, but a total newb can easily miss this. The blockchain shit itself when someone sent 0xff instead of a nullbyte bc originally it could be anything.


Very true. I don't think we're in disagreement. I'm not saying these issues are insurmountable problems or that GUIs don't make multisig easier: what I'm simply trying to do is share some of the reasons why it's more complicated than the "if ppl use multisig there'd be no problems" responses we often hear. 
That's why I was outlining the above: I want people to understand where the limitations are because not everyone wants to learn first hand or enjoy coding raw transactions for the hell of it.

You're not considering the vendors whose profit depends on the pull system (online subscriptions, porn, Netflix, etc). That being said, this is an important point, as I'm not a fan of companies being able to take money at will.


Except when you're ordering stuff that needs to be delivered! 


Not having customer information does not make things easier for merchants. Consumers? Maybe, but you should know that not everyone cares about privacy as stridently as Bitcoiners do. Furthermore, the Blockchain is not anonymous in any sense. It's a permanent record of transactions which can serve as a public means of financial spying on a level that's blows the current system out of the water.


Maybe that's something you'd want to find out since you're using it as a selling point, lol.


We're doing apples and oranges comparisons again. The vast majority of people don't use money transfer services, they use banks, whose fees are often less than Bitcoin.

I wanted to add this discussion in case people are interested: 
It basically outlines a malformed Tx which is represented by some APIs as non-canonical (ie it's different to the core rawtx) This can have downstream effects. So it's certainly relevant when discussing trust in the Blockchain/Tx data received.

That's completely contradictory. An experiment is only as good as the results and insight it gives. The very notion of implying trust is important in a trustless system makes zero sense. Likewise, it makes little sense to have third parties offer Bitcoin services as a means of a "patch" when they're driving Bitcoin towards centralised services. 


Why? Why must the experiment succeed? 
I tend to think the only reason Satoshi would walk away is because he saw Bitcoin as an experiment: how do you think Satoshi would feel about his "one CPU, one vote" currency being run by centralised mining and 3rd party services?

"Efficient" implies some metrics. More efficient how? Tx speed? Confirmation time? CO2? Safety? Short term hardware costs? Minting? Obviously none of these apply, but I'm curious what you believe


No, it's not immoral, nor amoral. It's very simple economics: shit ain't free. Furthermore, it's been the way that ever since prehistoric times that communities were made of contributors. This applies to finances as well. You have strong convictions but seem to reap the benefits of all you dispose.


You just said Bitcoin is better because it's more efficient


Let me lay it down for you: while you've been wrapped in cotton wool in the first world, devoid of direction, adversity or aspirations... When the worst thing you think the world has is taxes and fiat devaluation, you're making assumptions that are misinformed. 
The world wars weren't fought for profit or whatever strange brainwashing idea you have: these people put their fucking lives on the line and died, probably younger than you, on a beach trying to save other human communities from being gassed, executed, burnt alive, shot, bombed and raped. Some kid died younger than you on a faraway beach so you can live your cushy life and insult their memory and bravery. Well sir, fuck you. 


Does this apply to you? What makes you Dunning-Kruger proof? 
Better yet, pray tell, what makes you so morally upstanding? Community service? Nope. Communities are sheep flocks. Philanthropy? No... Inspiring others or respecting sacrifices made by others? Or perhaps helping the homeless? Or is it just being an insufferable prick who decides they're better than everyone yet eschews modern amenities, living off the land and practising what you preach?

*Does anyone see the problem with the FAQ and the discussion (below)? OP says its a threat only if there's a significant proportion of these pseudonodes...right after he says how you can have one setup in minutes and they can't be easily banned from the network. Seriously?*
This was an experiment into how easily can full nodes be "faked". In conclusion: very easily.
A proof-of-concept implementation (&amp;amp; documentation) is available here:
To the network, PseudoNode appears to be a normal full node. It relays invs, txs, blocks, etc. just like a full node. In reality, PseudoNode is a type of p2p proxy server. It merely forwards any request it cannot handle (getdata, getheaders, etc.) to neighboring nodes. For more information see the above links.
PseudoNode uses no disk (no blockchain download required), uses little CPU/RAM, and uses less network resources (bandwidth) than a normal full node. A PseudoNode can "sync" with the network within seconds.
PseudoNode demonstrates some of the problems with incentivized full nodes (including the "Bitnodes Incentive Program"). It is difficult to prove that a full node is really a full node.
The implementation mostly has novelty/proof-of-concept value. It is not intended to be "production" software.
And the FAQ:
Does PseudoNode harm the network?
Short answer: No.
Long answer: Not unless the number of PseudoNodes significantly overwhelms the number of normal full nodes. Otherwise, if PseudoNode can connect to at least some good nodes (default 2), then will PseudoNode will acts just like a normal node and contributes network bandwidth.
Can PseudoNode cause the network to fork?
No, PseudoNode just follows what other nodes are doing.
Can PseudoNode steal coins?
Can PseudoNodes be banned from the network?
Not easily. Requests that PseudoNode cannot handle directly can always be forwarded to other (cooperative) full nodes.

A full node -  - either has the whole Tx index or doesn't. You need to explicitly state *txindex=1*; it's got nothing to do with connection settings. By default the node is useless for validating Txns except your own.

So it's gotta be Bitcoin? The 20Mb block size still isn't implemented, so why shouldn't an alternate take be assessed? Bitcoin is an experiment which yields valuable insight into what does and doesn't work. How can Bitcoin offer everything to everyone? Explicitly: how can one determine what works if there's no experimentation outside Bitcoin. It's like limiting computing to punchcard typewriters because tablets are "cashing in" (businesses need money to research, code and such; "cashing in" for new technology is incentive to research)


I am not talking about currency functionality solely. Redundant Bitcoin clones like Litecoin != Ethereum.

And before you tell me I should've written the password down, perhaps you'll read  or consider not all keyboards are the same (TeamViewer for example). Mycelium 0.8.3 also didn't confirm you wanted to delete a private key. Brand new HDDs crash. You've got no proof, no experiences and an opinion, so great to know

Bitcoin's closest analog is NOT gold for the reasons you just gave: it's a physical commodity. Bitcoin is closest to Internet cash. 
That being said, the Spider-Man quote isn't necessarily a great thing in itself, as with great responsibility comes great risks. Consider whether people *want* to be their own bank - accepting all the associated risks - and the answer in the vast majority of cases is a resounding *no*. 
I like Bitcoin for the experiment it is. I like the idea of some of the smart contracts (Ethereum thrives in this area). I think the Blockchain offers some novel benefits. But, Bitcoin is not a panacea. It is novel, interesting and offers some interesting changes to the current state of affairs, but whether or not those changes are for the better (compared with the current system) remains to be seen. 
Honestly, the biggest problem Bitcoin faces is having a dozen coders working on a project which needs a development team numbering in the hundreds, at least.

So these questions you speak of... what are they? Because these subtle nuances are difficult to decipher when you've shut down these types of questions because they're new accounts which are clearly Buttcoin trolls using throwaways. It's good to see you're sticking to the important issues like post counts, karma and witch hunts, and you do so *consistently*: this is probably the 4th or 5th time you've done this kind of thing. 


So these ongoing issues, like 20Mb block size, Tx rate, security concerns etc: that's all stuff that's frivolous to you, is it? I say this because generally things "you hear a million times" are pressing issues relevant to the community: I'll bet the whole global warming thing must really aggravate you, it just keeps getting discussed like people are looking to discuss possible solutions and consequences...again and again! 


So now you have an issue with how people act in Buttcoin itself? Buttcoin is a great place; it's a mix of satire, experience, rational discussion and theoretical chats. It's great to be there because I can post here in and not be excommunicated by the group. Clearly the reverse isn't true. A lot of Buttcoin has been in Bitcoin, like myself, since ~2011. What is it exactly that trumps your opinion over years of experience?  But you know what I like most about Buttcoin? The alleged power we wield in vote manipulation, conspiratorial brigading, long-con reputation building for trolling purposes, oh, yes, and still contributing to the Bitcoin community, despite this inane tripe. If rational, calm discussion about facts and opinions based on years of experience are a problem for you, then perhaps you should consider telling us what makes you so much better.

I wouldn't say unfriendly. Some banks won't let you use LocalBitcoins but others will.
As for double tax, if you buy from CoinJar, then yes. They've got a weird setup which taxes you 10% and then assuming you're buying stuff from Australian websites, there's the same 10% tax included in all the prices (you never add sales tax here, it's just factored into the price). So at most you're paying the standard 10% GST if you don't buy through CoinJar.

So people are getting hacked, and companies...and that's supposed to be better than the protocol getting hacked? If the protocol was hacked it would provide more positives than slowly being hacked to obscurity. Why? Because a 2.0 of the Bitcoin experiment could build on the issues encountered now.

Altcoins generally refers to clones of Bitcoin (forks with varying POW/POS, variable block times etc), ie CannabisCoin, Feathercoin, etc etc
Ethereum and such aren't so much altcoins. They operate differently and are motivated but fundamentally different technology.
Writing off everything as an altcoin isn't necessarily accurate IMO.

OKCoin, and every other Chinese exchange, are intricately linked in their inner sanctum of insider trading. Clearly it's not far fetched to think the huge Ponzi scheme run by the other Chinese exchange is effecting the ecosphere. The Chinese are mining all the coins and better yet, are essentially walled off from rumours spreading through to English speakers until far too late (even hours). This Ponzi has ripped off some rich Chinese people, and if people think the Govt won't move to shackle Chinese Bitcoin businesses in response to large scale scams, they're forgetting history

You're right. It should, but I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there's not too many people who are versed in Bitcoin who can code as well and have the time to improve the network.

He's alluding to the fact that BTC can't be both totally transparent and totally anonymous by virtue of the fact that once you've pinned an address to a real-world identity, the transparency forgoes anonymity. Yes, this could be patched with future developments, but it's not the case now.

ABC is the equivalent of PBS in Australia. (Actually SBS is closer, but ABC broadcasts Sesame Street and documentaries and news shows etc; you won't see The Biggest Loser or whatever on it)

Yes. Because the latency from the pseudonode will add delays while adding nothing. So the sum total of *a negative* + *nothing* ==&gt; *negative outcome*. 


yep and bc of the way propagation of nodes for Bitcoin works, God forbid you get a node that's extremely slow and then the pseudonode compounds that further.
Also, what's stopping a huge proportion of these being used in nefarious/detrimental functionality? It's the kind of thing that should be assessed beforehand.

Oh course it is. If people can't see the obvious manipulation of the pumpers I'm amazed. It's taking candy from a baby; all it takes is some tentative news and people think this time is finally the one.

Who uses Bitcoin then? The investors? You're completely oblivious to the fact that PEOPLE need to use and approve of the technology. 


So these widgets are going to inundate people because... Reasons? You're saying the bad publicity will be a moot point because so many people are using it? On par with that circular logic is *no one drives in New York because there's too much traffic.*


Wow. I never knew the dot Com bubble was the world turning their back on the Internet! I thought it was investors leading money trying to buy into the buzz that surrounded financially incompetent companies. 
These "parallels" you're drawing between the Internet and Bitcoin are a stretch at best; and that's assuming we just ignore the huge historical inaccuracies these assumptions are based on. 
Bitcoin is an experiment. There is no company doing PR or paying R&amp;D costs. you're comparing apples with orange... coloured cats.
I like bitcoin as an experiment: I certainly can't see how anything you've asserted is true is anything more but naive speculation.

Thanks for adding this valuable insight. There's far too few self-centred posts discussing Bitcoin price and how it's great buying cheap coins
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:43:52


That's weird? Why? I find it weird that there's a whole bunch of people who've been in Bitcoin a year and think they know everything. 


Are you for real? That's the entire content of this fucking sub! There's no tech discussion or anything else, it's just memes and witch hunts and talk of trolls. There's absolutely no respect for a dissenting viewpoint and that is not a healthy community. So understand these "trolls" you speak of are interested in Bitcoin - it's the community that has often drained people like me to the point of "fuck it"
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:52:25


I'm confused. Who's paying a premium for what? For security? Don't we have secure payment systems today? Also, given miners are fully capable of 51% attack of they saw fit, it's not secure whatsoever


What self interest? The miners are conglomerates. For individuals the only self interest seems to be the inflating price of the token as an investment.
If we're talking about cryptocurrency in general, yeah, some of this applies, but there's a long way to go and Bitcoin won't be the iteration which is the standard IMO
@_date: 2015-02-24 06:44:39

It's a shame there not a more constructive voice handling inevitable legal hurdles. This was bound to happen. The status quo gets challenged and scams are prevalent: it had to happen. Again, it could've been better managed with more positive lobbying IMO.

Comments like this probably suggest the exact opposite

No, because

As opposed to the other Txs which do what? This is how internal tumbling works so you can't be sure because walletexplorer shows a wallet being emptied and moved to newly issued addresses any more than you can be sure a hacker gas emptied the wallet and split it. Show me the trail to another exchange and I'll believe your Blockchain analysis.
I don't doubt they've been "hacked". In fact, I'm 99% certain there's dodgy shit going down since MyCoin went under. What I take issue with is implying the Blockchain data proves this one way or another.

@_date: 2015-02-22 04:49:28


This has been asked over at [Bitcoin SE](bitcoin.stackexchange.com). It's very strongly implied that there is no answer to this because of the way POW hashing functions. I don't think there is any use for the data, but it's interesting in that *how can that be proved?*

Here's some disconcerting things to consider:
1. China's exchanges all seem to be practising regular shady tactics like insider trading, inflated trading volumes (This comes from the TeamSpeak and players like Jeff from Bitfinex)
2. China has the large majority of industrial mining operations
3. The language barrier essentially shuts out the Western World, and that's a huge advantage
4. China is very good at coordinating price pumps
Considering those three points, you have to conclude that the Chinese are very much running the distribution, manufacture and sale of Bitcoins on a very large scale, and it's even harder to believe that all these entities aren't operating symbiotically. It makes speculating a very risky game IMO
@_date: 2015-02-23 03:54:34


That is not what a rubber hose cryptanalysis refers to. This platitude is ridiculous because you're forgetting the HUMAN to PROTOCOL interface. Humans use Bitcoin. No one is arguing SHA256 is insecure; it's a strawman at best

The insight to be gleaned is that Satoshi went dark after the wikileaks drama and had never come back. Perhaps the bitcoin experiment was just that. The silence speaks volumes.
