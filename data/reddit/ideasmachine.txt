@_date: 2018-01-19 21:01:40
whats the alternative?  I would love a better option to get your funds into the exchanges...
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:15:10
yup, i'm sure there are lots of trolls here getting paid by the post to spread FUD
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:56:27
100k noobs....that will eventually leave when they really understand the game and its players
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:11:31
yup if they go to low then all faith will be lost and they wont be able to recoup, 1% of BTC holders own 99% of BTC they do what they want just have to buy the dips and have patience.

@_date: 2018-01-12 21:54:26

@_date: 2018-01-05 10:43:12

@_date: 2018-01-26 10:13:00

@_date: 2018-01-25 04:40:54
Maybe its Roger V
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:45:25
I would still like to yell at conbase for crashing BTC
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:09:39
Do you guys get paid by the post?  
Did no one notice what happened when the first batch of contracts expired? 
Just watch and wait for tomo...
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:39:50
It took a month of support tickets to finally get my coins off their exchange, and I will never go back, the layout is terribly confusing and my experience was horrible.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:33:36
you only lose if you sell, unless it was bought on margin...them dudes are str8 fucked
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:17:46
FUD as usual
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:14:14
once the market cap reaches 1trillion plus it wont affect it as much...thank god they cant print more btc
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:27:12
Sounds like BITCONNECT
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:35:36
no one gives a shit, more bullshit...
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:25:20
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:41:39
Well knowing Coinbase is it possible they will pull a super dick move and cancel the orders?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:11:29
is love to see a bot free exchange
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:15:59
feels fishy right when the corporates are about to get involved at NASDAQ...
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:41:33
haven't made any moves yet gonna observe till the weekend, LTC volume was very high today.  Corrections will come for BTC as well lets hope it works out in our favor.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:46:15
Why is this pinned, its like saying look both ways before you cross the street or don't eat the yellow snow...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:57:48
Calm your pee pants, BTC was just attacked yesterday no one said the attack was over...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:45
Sorry on Binance Bitcoin Cash is listed as (BCC)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:49:14
lol some people cant get their funds off gdax like a fucked up hostage situation
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:07:13
The fucking bots are out of control i hope they drown in fees...
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:28
although the trading interface on Binance is pretty sub par they need a better GUI
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:49
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:16
I removed all my coins from coinbase a while back, but curious does all this stem from their BCH fiasco?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:06:20
already happening to all coins
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:26:38
There is a coin called PonziCoin (PONZI)?  Seriously....anyone have any???
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:39:34
that's the CryptoHypno effect....
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:42:21
What's all this bitcoin cash bullshit going on... Its confusing as hell
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:45:36
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:34:17
Coinbase asks also when you dealing with larger amounts
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:10:53
fucking spoofers
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:27
time for the turn around
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:55
these schemes are horrible...i hope BCH plummets to nothing as people realize its just pump and dump
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:26
they want you scared so you sell your bitcoin and they can buy it cheap....
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:58:37
I wonder if it would have been as bad if he just used a different name, I mean bitcoin cash really.  That's like someone opening new company and calling it NIKE SHOES, and claiming we are the real NIKE
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:31
Only Ripple is in the positive? WTF where is the money going is there a new special iphone that requires bitcoin to buy it?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:08:17
No it's not, its also not cool to keep driving the Bitcoin prices down.... Now I need a J
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:13
Aww what the fuck is this all coinbases fault?  
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:51:13
Well he did say insider trading isn't a crime
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:07:36
I have many but here is one, i've read that both coins cant coexist, does that suggest one coin will crash or possible to be absorbed by the other if that's even possible.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:18:02
So Ripple is the the central banking systems Bitcoin killer huh?  I have ripple myself so I am not bashing, it works great.  Just that this price manipulation is just blatant, as well as the media coverage...BTC was great because of what it stood for, this is just corporate greed as usual.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:53:07
I was told below $600 a yr its OK to not report it, can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:07:10
Still idiots buying BCH...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:18:37
 take it lol!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:02
so do i, and that ver prick
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:50:17
you would think that the transaction fees would keep people from selling
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:20:28
Do people still think that they need to buy a whole bitcoin? Who cares what the price is for 1 coin....buy what u can its the percentages that matter... Noob central here
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:07:46
Hedge Funds...
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:54:10
I can see that, was just looking for answers...
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:23:12
Why are gdax prices so off?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:31:53
of course coinbase is doing maintenance....wtf
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:00:57
Any thoughts on what will happen?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:12:46
Until that network gets clogged up as well, and im sure you want it to be centralized as well giving control to a minority.  Decentralized is the key 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:43:05
its the banks...ripple was the only crypto in green last night, bank of england uses ripple
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:32
looking forward to the bcash CRASH if that massive sell order goes through on GDAX HODLERS are golden!
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:03:13
I'm enrolled in this course, its not purely about Bitcoin just a heads up its more about blockchain technologies and its fairly technical. As I went to school for engineering its feels pretty familiar also challenging.  The material is very good, the videos do put me to sleep though...just like being back in school lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:41:17
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:25:18
who knows for sure....I just blame coinbase and BCH, as soon as BCH was listed on Coinbase the shit ate thru the fan and it fucking fell on our heads
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:08:58
Samourai Wallet  is interesting
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:53:01
Fuck them...
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:20:42
So before the dip a few days back the market cap was ~630 Billion, now its at ~500 billion.  Lol where did the 100 billion go?  back of my mind keeps thinking someone wanted these coins cheap and normal people freaked out and sold, therefore transferring them to the rich that missed out, the ones that said btc was shit and worthless...
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:46:51
depends if you are trading over 2btc or not
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:49:29
just transfer it to another exchange gdax is shite
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:50:22
tradeblock is decent
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:26:14
Thinking about dumping all my bitcoin for Litecoin, I don't trust the futures traders feel like they are controlling the bitcoin price and stumbling its growth....also the transaction fees and times for BTC are getting ridiculous anyone else have thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:58:11
lol, this is the beginning, shits not going anywhere, eventually we will all have qr code tattoos and will be charged for everything including air...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:48
cant use gdax currently, its like a stuck turd
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:38:27
Yeah, isn't that always the case!
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:16:36
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:36:16
Bitcoin is the original even though there are other blockchain technologies that may be more efficient and economical, time will tell...
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:02:21
thank god wall street going home for the holidays finally seeing some green
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:10:09
So Goldman Sachs which is essentially hand in hand with Washington and Capitol Hill wants to open an exchange, and Coinbase has all these issues driving the price down and causing average Americans to sell...I wonder who is gonna buy it all up low.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:26:35
HODL if you hear me!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:16
So far Binance has been the best for me.  I tried Kraken who locked me out of my account which I still cant log into to get my Ripple out.  Coinbase , well that's how we get our money onto the table, necessary evil but don't use it for holding or trading.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:59:03
im sorry i asked
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:32:11
Ripple is doing real well and is actually used in the real world.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:11:58
bcash is dead horse
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:09:40
not with all the bots pumping and dumping
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:23:02
Why the fuck would you name it Bitcoin Cash it sounds like  a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:23
I had some BCH sold that shit like hotcakes, its tainted now
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:05:47
No complaints on binance except the trading interface needs a refresh
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:41:08
lol just a coincidence that everything is in the green after wall st shuts down...greedy bastards
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:41:00
Tuesday Dec 19th Market cap was 630,369,000,000 USD
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:19
I will drink to my HODLING and yours!
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:54:25
seriously not letting you see the chart history on GDAX even....
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:24:09
mostly the people that dont know whats goin on are still spouting that bcash nonsense 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:45
BCH trading is running smooth at binance, just sold my BCH for BTC and came out positive
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:25:59
thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:12:16
no probably not
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:54:50
lol now i see why scottrade reports were so useful...converting eth/btc/ltc conversions are going to be a pain in the ass, plus you need the fucking timestamps...
How is the IRS gonna keep up, an audit would take years for a bot using day trader that has thousands of daily transactions...
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:52:41
it is friday lets hope pockets run deep
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:34:52
what happened, entire market showing red...even ripple
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:13:43
Invest only what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:25:15
coinbase/gdax are greedy as hell, manipulate charts, claim outages, freeze buying and selling....
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:00
New laws will charge tax on eth to btc and other conversions as well
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:35
go to gdax.com and choose the BCH exchange
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:24:38
use gdax
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:02:48
So anyone have any thoughts of why there are almost no articles describing the current dip?  I am gonna hold on been in this for over a year and this is just another small tremor, like the many that have happened in the past.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:25:54
it broke, the banks got in and got their cheap bitcoin now they are on holiday the charts look different if you are paying attention
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:40:49
Are you also taxed on converting one coin to another? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:14:35
if the fees were super cheap the bots would have a field day
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:23:44
you need your feet in both buckets, im split 50/50 between btc and bch, wasn't the way I wanted it but hey it is what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:24:58
You probably need a Mystical keyboard that you must buy with BCH
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:04
BCH = BIG CONSPIRACY HOAX
Have fun with this
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:24:14
type it in
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:02:42
glad i could be of service
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:02:41
you should be able to log in with your coinbase account.  As long as that is verified then you should be good to go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:43
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:58:21
nope 0.5btc for 5eth
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:50:46
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:27
thats been around nothing new
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:52:17
wait for trezor update, if needed immediately id go for ledger nano S
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:12:12
Well...you know they can manipulate the price with or without and exchange if they want to so maybe it will create more traction and overall growth
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:58:47
sorry 9eth
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:21
LOL " The CRASHENING" I love it
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:08:27
People taking money out to spend for holidays, deep pockets taking out more
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:33:48
its pissing me off
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:43:32
all crypto not just btc...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:54:20
just swapped 5 eth for 0.5 btc, i hope we get back up to 17k
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:37:25
Be suspicious of any service that asks you to give them your bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:59:31
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:19:06
thanks for helping, ill continue my search for more info and keep my BTC
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:01:53
Fake news is being circulated everywhere like a childish game of telephone, coin on coin bashing, govt banning news when its not true, everyone is scheming and its not helping the cryptosphere at all.  Meanwhile all the major companies are working on blockchain technologies, even Visa has openings for blockchain developers.  Blockchain tech is here to stay companies, banks and governments are all afraid...the system is fighting back.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:36:00
its the people that are retarded and fake news is whats to blame
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:44:30
/s for sarcasm at end of your statement....for all the new people
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:42:25
kraken sucks good luck getting your coins off the exchange
