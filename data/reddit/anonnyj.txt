btc-e is back as wex.nz
Old btc-e accounts get "tokens" relative to how much they were holding before. You can trade them in, or wait for them to go up in value or some shit.
They lost MetaTrader support, though.
Edit: Note, they no longer do business with Americans (though IIRC you can get a foreigner you trust to spot you and get you back in).

Not an argument.

That'd be perfectly fine for a personal account, which this is not.

Key word "effectively", there seems to be no comment in OP about thinking it's intentional.

People knew about PRISM etc in advance too, but you were a conspiracy theory crackpot if you talked about it

Telling everyone to do that would probably net Coinbase enough new active traders to more than pay for people trying to pull a fast on on fees.

@_date: 2018-01-05 15:54:13
Yes. It's the new version of btc-e.
They don't serve Americans now though because of the mess before.

Perhaps try random off by one letter typos. If you're lucky, there was only one mistake... 
grow -&gt; groe / groq / grpw / grip   
Or perhaps all letters were capital? Or just the first letters of each word?

25% is huge. 
Sure more is needed, but 25% is still huge. Intentional spam aside (which this makes costlier), the reduction would help prevent this kind of clogging even happening in the first place.

Also "too", not "to"...

Anything but absolutely airtight code could cause a huge mess/loss of faith. "We fixed some boring crypto shit" doesn't make headlines.

lmao the ordering on this site is fucked
If you try to order by numbers, it does it "alphabetically". 900 -&gt; 90 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 800 -&gt; 80 -&gt; 700 etc

Cash is a favorite among terrorists, criminals, Nazis (ie people who don't agree with you), pedos, etc.
It's about time we banned cash!
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:56:19
That has been my experience too, amongst several apps, which seems odd as hell because it's trivial to code. Perhaps the exchanges themselves are choking at the interesting points, and dropping connections.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:31:25
Yeah, like one of your guesses: The point being that it's only fast, at the moment, because it's empty.
People here say BCH's ledger will be too bloated at scale  because of the increased block size. No clue if that's relevant/true though.

Real talk, make sure to choose a good name. Perhaps bounce it off friends/people here first.

Weekly? Sounds a little frequent (at least from a position of ignorance). What do you do there?
