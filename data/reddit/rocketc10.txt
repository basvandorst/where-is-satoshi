Bitcoin,s existence does not depend on the destruction of fiat currencies. However, the continued existence of fiat currencies may depend on the destruction of Bitcoin. There will likely be an attempt to overthrow power, but Bitcoin will not be the aggressor, it will just have to survive it.

"In particular, reformers pushed for standardization and control over small change in order to reduce transaction costs. While thousands of different kinds of currencies may work well enough for small, local markets, national markets demanded national monies -- or so the thinking went."
So if National economies need a National currency, what do International economies need?

It makes sense that having a 1000 currencies would become bothersome as the economy of a nation was becoming more nationalized. 250 years ago, railroads and the telegraph were all working to 'shrink' nations around the world, so it stands to reason to make a more universally accepted currency. 
Today, the internet has created a market that connects private buyers and sellers across international lines. They're simply too many currencies for the modern marketplace. If private citizens, under different governments, are to make exchanges, there needs to be a universal currency, which must be recognized equally by each citizen, regardless of governance. Therefore, the currency should not favor one state over the other, but should be stateless and decentralized.  
The article argues that Bitcoin will fail because several private currencies no longer exist, because a government destroyed them. The author fails to mention how many National currencies failed, because its government has destroyed itself. Nobody uses the Byzantine Solidus.

"The dollar will never fall to Bitcoin"... 'because if it might, we will kill you.'
