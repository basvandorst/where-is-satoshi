At least the tooth fairy left a paper wallet. Seems legit.

Thanks. Sorry for the repost.

Also got it. Weird.

I've never used it, and seriously doubt "the survival" of bitcoin has to do with *any* particular exchange. I wouldn't want bitcoin's image associated with a guy who allegedly laundered money to drug traffickers either, and apparently neither does the BTC foundation.
Whatever, there's tons of exchanges and services being made every day at this point.

Agreed. Its just better for the image of the foundation to cut ties.

Positive news moves slow. Give it a few weeks.
Meanwhile negative news even if its unconfirmed seems to cause instant panic sell. Whatever, more cheap coin for us.

This is still good news!

Actually never mind. I get it. Coinbase seems to print a wallet from their website which wouldn't actually be safe at all right? Whereas the service you're suggesting has a java client so I could run it from a boot CD or compute disconnected from the internet right?

OK i exaggerate. You scan a QR code and its paid. Takes a minute.

I would buy litecoin if there was a service similar to coinbase that made it easier than me having to go through OKpay or a similar small and not exactly trustworthy pay service..

oh my god, you're right.

This seems convenient. I'm worried about losing the private key though. Do most people make multiple copies in paper just in case and store them in multiple places? I'm more paranoid of losing it than getting hacked overall..

I don't quite understand how everything works offline. How does my wallet receive bitcoin if there's no access to the blockchain ledger

Paying for my seedbox for torrenting... takes literally one second to pay in bitcoins using my coinbase wallet.
If anyone is interested since most people post businesses that offer bitcoin payment, the service is Feral Hosting
