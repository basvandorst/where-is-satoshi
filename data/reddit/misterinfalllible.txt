\&gt; What started really to bother me, is my girlfriend. I lost completely her credibility about business and money.
Tulips, beanie babies.

In theory smart contracts might be ok.
In practice, the room for careless or malicious coding makes them unusable.

I don't expect perfect results for a long time, in part because current users don't care enough to demand one- they're using every new crapcoin as an gambling opportunity and don't really care about the currency aspect.
Remember "smart contracts"?  Those people are a community that tolerated false claims about their utility and implementation.  And they also signed off on claims about using the blockchain for anything.

In theory.
In practice, it's a crappy design, crappy implementation, with crappy crypto tools and crappy exchanges.  Riddled with con artists.
When there's a failure, the community doesn't police itself repeats.
Enthusiasts pretend that it is simultaneously a store of value, a volatile investment, and a currency.  You don't want something that's simultaneously all three of these things.


Enthusiasts don't have a working model for what this would look like.

Bitcoin is useful for certain special cases, like smuggling drug money.

Here's an overview I started skimming.
\&gt; but what would it take for them to be functional and secure; 
Dunno - I don't really know cryptocoin stuff, I've only observed that the current implementation and community are so bad it's not worth participating it.
Broadly, do we want an area of finance where regulators and antifraud cops can't parachute in and fix stuff, freeze stuff, or reverse stuff?  
Is this how you want your stock market and checking account to work?

If you really hate someone, teach them to recognize bad keming.

Blockchain isn't just for the unbanked,
real people in developing nations already have non-cryptocoin stuff that works better and cheaper than cryptocoin stuff.


I think OP is secretly hoping to defeat moore's law.

If everyone lost faith in driving on the right and half of folk started driving on the left, there'd be mass deaths on the streets.  This situation is no more farcical than your scenario.
The Euro and Dollar are backed up by the 800M who support it, and the 7B+ people that want it.
Meanwhile, you're pretending that your speculative investment vehicles are also functional currencies that usefully transfers value, when that's really only true for drug cartels and so on.
Various cryptocoins fail all the time, as the pump and dump people bail and screw the bagholders.  Worse, clusters of coins all rise and crater at the same time.
So it's actively harmful for you try to get your parents to join other suckers when they might bet on the wrong coin, or hold the right coin for too long.
The only way you could hurt them more is to convince them to store wealth in an cryptocoin exchange.
