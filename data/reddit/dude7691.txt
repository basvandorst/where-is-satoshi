Kraken works well for me. Use SEPA transfers to transfer directly to your bank account. I typically get about 98% of the value of the BTC directly in my bank with the other 2% being taken by fees.

Also why tf this post downvoted? If this guy wants to sell his BTC let him, it's his money.

This made my day, thank you kind sir.

I am around 6 months into my investments in crypto, so I'm fairly new but I know BTC has come back from China fud, attempted BCH takeover and worse in the past (mt gox). But this is quite a big deal if there aren't enough bulls to keep the price stable as the big shorts deploy their cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:57
The time to sell was at $15-20k, not now. I didn't manage to because kraken was being stupid so I decided to just hold on. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:07:20
Think about it, they trade in $ right? BTC is set to destroy the $ one day, or seriously devalue it. So their current masses of wealth would be worth next to nothing (hyperinflation). It's in their best interests to destroy bitcoin before it grows too large for them to stop.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:49:28
Or use your BTC to trade with and then acquire more BTC like I do :) 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:25:40
Because that wasn't the rate we got it for, we only own around 0.934BTC between us. I had to wait until I was 18 before I could buy with my own ID and stuff so I missed out on 2.4k when I wanted to buy (back in July), was 18 on the first of this month. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:14:51
Bought $4550 worth at $4.6k BEFORE the china news. Got a brief chance to sell again at a $20 loss, but was convinced we'd pull through short term, how wrong I was... Gonna try to buy the dip to get my dollar cost average down to $4.3k ish 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:24:42
No, I was entrusted with managing the entire portfolio and I chose when to buy, I made a mistake and have apologised profusely. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:06:57
Yeah I wish I could do that haha. Come back in 3 months to ATH's of 6k, I'm a bit too addicted though xD
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:01:02
Have to agree with this, I think I'm gonna see if there's a temporary rise, sell, then wait for the FUD and buy back in when it hits lows over the weekend. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:24:00
Trying to do that, I have another $1000 which I would be willing to invest but I don't know where that bottom is going to be. Some reports saying it will consolidate now around 3800-3900. Others saying Goldman's predictions of $2221 are well within reach. Buying $1k at $3900 which I could do now would lower my average to around $4390 which means that if we get back to that I'd break even. Just a huge risk and that would mean practically all my net worth is tied up in BTC. Just wish I'd waited another day before china started chatting shit because then I would've waited. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:17:29
Well it's true, coinbase screwed me over and indirectly have made me lose a shit tonne of money despite the fact I'm actually predicting the rises and falls correctly. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:36:21
Well judging as the price has just gone back up to $4,700 there is still potential. But yeah I think the best advice from all of this is to try and not watch the markets because then you just drive yourself mad, only really applicable to day traders. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:14:46
No, I'm mad at people selling at the mercy of corrupt governments and bankers who only have their own vested interest at heart. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:17:32
I only gambled what I could afford to lose, I didn't expect to be going in and losing absolutely everything to scammers. And as far as I know if you win you can sue for the court costs and such. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:15:02
Because they only let me sell into euros and none of the exchanges I've found will let me deposit those euros. I have a UK bank account so I'll end up paying loads of fees. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:04:40
Sorry to hear that man, you must feel shit as I do. None of us predicted this China stuff, I bought because I thought it was just profit taking at $5k which I predicted. Immediately after I bought, a $100 rise which was going to be to around $4.9k I would have said where it would have found new support. As soon as China started chatting shit we dropped to $4.1k. That's rough though man, the danger with altcoins. Huge gains but also huge losses (if you sell). Best of luck anyway man, that $1k loss represents about 20% of my net worth (I'm 18), so I hope your loss hasn't impacted you too much. All the best 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:07:33
Reassuring words man, thank you :) 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:28:51
Well I've hold on this long despite billions of dollars being panic sold and I have no plans on letting go just yet haha so I'm doing pretty well I'd say ;) 
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:23:22
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:06:22
Yeah I wish I could take my eyes off it for 3-4 months and come back to an ATH of 6k haha. Think I'm a bit addicted xD
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:13:25
My main problem is I bought in initially at 4.6k before the china news, and then kept getting told to HODL by everyone around me, including my investment partner. We sold at 3.7k predicting a dip and I predicted right, it went down to 3.47k this morning and I missed it, and now I feel the only direction we're heading is up. So I'm $1200 down in a week. And I can't afford counselling :/ 
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:26:09
My account was not hacked, I can be sure of that and there was no malware on my computer. My account was only active for 10 minutes before I deposited any money, the probability of an anonymous hacker discovering my account and then taking action against it is highly unlikely. And yeah, I'd rather make a statement and make sure the site either gets properly regulated or shut down for the good of others, because it's a load of bullshit. I only gambled what I could afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:08:01
Yeah you should be man, made a good move. Unlucky on the drop, must've been hard through the rough years. You deserve your profits for having the courage to stick it out :) 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:05:11
Yeah if I hadn't bought already I'd be waiting now, because there's so much uncertainty in the market there's no chance for big rises. Good move. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:50:28
okay yeah, that explains it xD
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:15:45
Same here :/ $4620 1 day after the 5k sell off
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:50:28
okay yeah, that explains it xD
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:22:21
This chart might help you
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:08:00
Or just sell it for fiat then convert that into BTC using the fiat. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:03:04
link me? Haven't seen it. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:29:08
What price did you buy at? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:18:23
This is what I mean, I am sure this is what has happened, their support are so sarcastic as well telling me to have a "great day". Like fuck off you just stole all my money am I really gonna have a great day? lmao
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:28:33
Ignorant? Explain
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:44:58
Yeah I mean with the October closure of juan-btc trading in Oct and the uncertainty of segwit 2x I think there's a chance I might see it again. But who knows. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:33:05
Was trying to compile evidence of the site being a scam, I hate people like this who literally ruin people's lives just so they can increase on their millions.
