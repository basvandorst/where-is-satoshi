I have a feeling you know you're joking, but in case anyone else doesn't get it:
In hacking, there are three types: white, black, and red. It has nothing to do with skin color.
**Edit:** For those who don't know what a Red Hat is, it's the term for a government employed hacker. (There is also a Blue Hat (who hacks for revenge: i.e. Anonymous).
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:57:49
Yes. Because the proportion of time needed to statistically analyze the block chain is equal to time spent on reddit. Get your nonsense out of here, and while you're at it: Fuck you.

Meh. Too propaganda-y for me. I mean, I love BTC, but not this video.

I have a 32 core server that's dormant at the office... I'll boot up a cpu miner and point it at whichever pool you guys recommend; it's not much but it's at least something. Anyone want to save me some googling time and point me to a quick how-to? (I'm at work)
EDIT: I've got it set up and I'm mining! It's not doing much, but it's something ~~(&gt;0.7MH/s)~~(2.554MH/s). I'm using Slush's pool. Here's the miner I'm using:  and here's Slush:  . If you build cpuminer, make sure you have libcurl4-openssl-dev package (assuming you're using Debian).

I believe it does indeed have to do with trusting corporations. It's not just fortune 500's that I'm talking about, though: I run a software corporation, if I were to sell closed-source code, my clients would have to trust me as well. Every client I've had (with the funds to do so) has done an audit on the code we produce, and I respect that. Anyone who uses software deserves the chance to do an audit.

Uhm, you're an idiot. The main reason this was even found at **all** was because it was open source and a contributor of RedHat reported it--and then a patch was applied a week later. In closed-source systems, this would have been less likely to been found. However, it's always your choice to enjoy your closed source bullshit.

is mostly correct, but don't get hung-up on the dollar-values. It doesn't have anything to do with the price. It has to do with people spending bitcoins they've received from mining vs coins they've received by spending their income purchasing (or, ideally, money they've received by performing services in exchange for BTC, but this is significantly less common).
BTC has become more precious to us than it once was. If we spend our BTC, we can't just tell ourselves that we'll just wait a couple of days or weeks and let our miners replenish our stash. A lot of BTC was free money back then (free at the cost of electricity, but that wasn't substantial enough to change our perceptions of it). Now, mining hardware isn't everyday hardware that most users have--now they're specialized and expensive. You can't get bitcoin without significant cost.
tl;dr: BTC's scarcity (in terms of the common-user) has increased. So now that my supply has become more finite, when I give my coins away, I feel like I'm giving away something that isn't free or easily obtained.

Can you add some scale to the pictures (like... a banana or something)? I'm seriously interested in buying one if the size is right. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:03:54
It's also (temporarily) convenient, because 1m฿ ~= $1 US

I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to accomplish, but regarding theft and reddit: I think the only theft to be had is by social-engineering people (like I've loosely done to your account), and then either using that information to aim an attack on their web-wallet, or to gain access to their reddit account and swipe their coins stored within their Considering much of reddit doesn't use SSL, the latter is significantly easier.
**Edit**: Also, it really bothers me that you're not concerned about me, a random stranger, having your phone, address, and personal email. Social engineering is a real thing to get past people's passwords. If I know enough about you, I can call twitter and get them to reset your password and send it to my own email. Additionally, say I thought you slept with my girlfriend (I don't think this, by the way), I know where you live and how to get ahold of you. If I thought you deserved a beating (again, I don't), it wouldn't be hard to arrange. (Please don't interpret this as a threat at all. I'm just trying to get you to see the importance of privacy.)

I actually think the reality of this situation is counter-intuitive. Back in my BTC tipping days* I used to tip $5-$10 for posts that I found informative or ones that made me laugh--but it was because Bitcoin was a science project. Yeah, sure it had value, but I didn't think it would actually become this *real*. So, it was easy for me to spend. It was like tipping monopoly money. **Now when I see bitcoin, I actually see a currency.** I'm not tipping you fun-money, I'm tipping you money I worked for. This makes me more stingy. When I was tipping you $10 it was because I was making $50/day mining--I didn't work for that $10; if I tip you $10 now it's because I went to an exchange and bought it. It's a different mindset.
Compare that to doge: doge *is* fun-money. Its entire premise is that it's a joke coin. Sure, I'll tip doge, because while it *is* worth something, I don't view it like I view BTC or the dollar.
\* I rotate reddit accounts about once a year; I don't like having a posting history that's long enough to identify me.

This is most likely a PR/lawsuit plan in lieu of being sued for holding that guys' funds excessively and having one of the PayPal managers saying that Bitcoin is against PayPal's business model.

Congress are part of the opposition to make ISPs into a utility. Making ISPs a utility is a solution that would render this whole debacle moot.

Oh, that's an position I can tolerate. I mean, I don't agree with it, especially if you're lumping integrity in with security (which you may or may not be doing), but it's at least not frustrating. You're just choosing to trust corporations more than I am willing to.

It's because information is power, Tim Peterson. I know you're studying at [REDACTED]. I know you wear [REDACTED] and have a [REDACTED]. I know you're [REDACTED]. I know that you use a [REDACTED]. I know you've worked on [REDACTED]. You know a [REDACTED], and a few others. Now, I don't know how well you know them, but I know you know them and I know under what context you know them. This was all gleaned without even sorting through your twitter (which was easy to find)...
So, no, it's not that I fear people will take my BTC... I just value my privacy. It's my life and I'd prefer to not share it with every stranger on the internet. The majority of people are sane and possibly even pleasant, but it only takes one malicious person with an agenda to really fuck things up for you.
**Edit**: Holy shit man. I have your address, phone number, and your personal email. See my PM; I'll tell you how I got it so you can purge it from the internet.
**Edit 2**: Redacted your information. Good luck, @_date: 2014-03-05 19:06:27
Because security flaws like this have never been years later that were found in closed-sourced systems (cough Windows). C'mon, man. I don't understand your argument against open source as inferior to closed sourced. Closed source has absolutely no benefit for the consumer, and you're shunning open sourced applications because it gives the user the ability to review and modify code if they are able and want to.

Sure, a P2P Exchance could replace Cryptsy, but it won't replace MtGox, Coinbase, and other centralized fiat/crypto exchanges, which is what was referencing.

Oh come on. I have a checking and savings account in USD. I also have a checking and savings account in BTC. When I'm buying something online with a site that offers to transact in BTC, I will use my BTC; if not, then I'll use my card. Just because people are not spending their BTC for the sake of spending it (because it's "cool" or whatever) doesn't mean they're holding; you wouldn't advocate that people don't have a savings, would you?

WTF? Shame on you for upvoting this, Cloud Coins are a fucking sham. [They have over 1,000,000 pre-mined blocks.](
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:03:01
And how would you decentralize the fiat part of the p2p exchange? You can't. That's why bitcoin is so important.

As a coinbase user, I wouldn't mind having your team reply to Mr. Wales on Reddit instead of email, so I could also be more deeply informed of how your bid/ask system works.

I like this very much--even as just an example of why open source facilitates creativity. Thanks for doing this, man.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:24:11
This is indeed correct. If you spend your coins from your wallet, there is a VERY good chance your backup will have less (or zero) coins.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:18:13
is right. It is not an acceptable solution to have anything less than purely anonymous votes. Trading anonymous voting for anything will only breed problems. Vote-bullying is a real and powerful threat--this isn't theory: it has been shown to happen in the past.

I wanted to say, "Mine them." But with ASICs being dominant, it's kind of worthless. I read a paper earlier, that proposed a fix to that by lowering the rewards proportionally such that a block is mined every second (which also fixed the transactions per second problem), so hopefully that gets traction and the whole issue is fixed and I can again say, "Mine".
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:12:39
Cool man, I like that you explained its conception and your methodology to solve the problem without making it a 5 page article. I love hearing about solution processes, and this one was nice and clean. Good job.

Does Mt. Gox give you an option to specify the Tx fee when transferring your coins? (Genuine question)
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:43:09
Oh fuck off with your misinformation. Open source allows its userbase (those that are able) to collaborate and apply a fix, rather than having them just sit on your thumbs and wait for the proprietary vender to implement and release it. It also allows the *public* to audit the software and not just low-bidding auditor.
