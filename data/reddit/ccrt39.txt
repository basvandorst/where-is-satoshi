I've managed to make a full lightning/bitcoin node run on [mobile]( any merchants in the uk interested in accepting lightning payments? I'm looking for some early adopters/testers

I've been working on creating an all-in-one, simple to use point of sale system, [ It's still early days though

Accepting btc isn't great due to wait time and transaction fees. In my opinion lightning network(bitcoin 2nd layer) seems like a good solution(no wait time, negligible transaction fees. That being said, lightning is still in very alpha phase.

electrum: This is the closest one, does offline transaction signing. Unfortunately missing bip44 and does its own mnemonic thing

Don't think I can get the master node out
Hard to sign transactions offline
No bip44

What options do I have for a cold storage wallet? My requirements are:  
* I can generate addresses offline  
* I can sign transactions offline(I transfer unsigned transactions by usb)  
* bech32 addresses  
* supports HD wallet, bip32(I only have to backup one thing!)  
* I can backup the master node(master key and chain code)  
* I can backup wallet accounts(the ext priv and pub)  
* bip44 so I can split my coins into "long term account, beaten with wrench fake account, daily account, change account etc"  
* run on desktop(I want to run it on a raspberry pi with no wifi wrapped in a Faraday cage)  
* open source

I'm building a [directory]( of places that accept main-net lightning payments, so far I have bitrefill, tor guard and the blockstream store. Know of any others?

Like a map? :) [
If you zoom out you can see two places!!
