Gotcha. Thanks for the info. So if you want to be private you don't want to give it out. Especially if you're trying to stay under the radar.

Could you store your bitcoins on a paper wallet and a Trezor? Or it one or the other? What are the pros vs the paper wallet? Cons?

So say I purchase from Coinbase, once it is in my account I want to move it to a paper wallet? Let's say I make 1 paper wallet, can I just move bitcoins I purchase from Coinbase to this same paper wallet? I apologize, I'm very new to this. I've read A LOT. But I still feel like I know nothing.

So the 3 paper wallets have nothing to do with what's stored on the Trezor?

On localbitcoin.com I see you buy from individuals, is there any risk in this? Like I'm guessing you create an account and put your wallet address on it?

Noob here, since people are handing out their bitcoin address left and right. Is it safe to do this? What are the cons along with passing out your address?

Do I need to tell my CPA that I purchased bitcoins? Or just oh my normal taxes?

I understand other people's views, I just don't understand the negativity. You sound like you know what you're doing, and even if you don't you sound like you LOVE what you're doing! We need more people like you. Thanks for the good read and replying to so many comments.

Every withdrawal has to be manually approved by a polo employee. This is causing delays. There is no way to speed this process up unfortunately. I've seen waiting over 24 hours now with no confirmation. I did submit a ticket though as a backup so maybe if someone looks at the ticket before looking at my withdrawal they can approve.
