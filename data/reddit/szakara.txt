The market is jaded now. Floors and ceilings mean a lot less than then used to. If you are arguing the complete opposite, someone who ignores the market book completely, I would say you are naive.
Edit: That was a typical dickish redditor response of me. Forgive me, I have been out drinking. You have to evaluate which orders are legitimate and which are not and make your trading decisions from there. It is easier during high trading activity and dramatic price fluctuations than it is in a stagnant market. Genuine floors/ceilings can be vital information for the active trader.

No no, I should have been more clear. He/she was repeatedly placing and retracting their orders, anytime it was close to executing (or actually did a little bit), it was canceled for a few minutes and then placed elsewhere in hopes other people would sell or place sell orders that they could then buy into without the price slipping upward.

This is just a floor at 127 and a volume spike hasn't occurred. There are no phony buy and sells occurring.
I don't think your reference applies to this scenario.

Indeed. A lot of people want to burn Mt. Gox at the stake when they are attacked and bogged down, but I don't see much praise about their new trading engine. They have been making significant improvements to their infrastructure and public relations.
If you can't handle the volatility and the growing pains that come with participating in a paradigm shift in currency, either reduce your holdings (I did :) or leave the market altogether. No one is forced to buy BTC.
Things will get better with time, but expect more DDoS attacks, downtime, and huge price swings in the near future...

There was a bid floor of 8,000 @ $127 and a few other large floors between 125 and 126.5 (See [126.5]( [125.21]( [125.00](
This was a very opportune time for a large holder to sell because the price slippage was kept to a minimum. Rarely can a seller expect such liquidity.
Given [the waning interest in Bitcoin]( and growing fears that Mt. Gox may face serious legal issues this year (CoinLab, DHS Dwolla account Seizure, and Liberty Reserve being taken down) I would think anyone with that much money in Mt. Gox would seriously be considering moving their assets to a safer location, at least for the interim.

Totally true, but you can just put in 1 for the amount. I thought it would be nice to show how much Mt. Gox is making off your trade, since they don't display that info in their UI. I just threw this together last night. I will add more bells and whistles when I have more time. Thank you for your feedback.

If bitcoins were completely useless, well, at least as useless as tulips, they would trade for less. Less people would buy into something that is completely useless. Even you said yourself...


But then you say ...


Emphasis on nothing there. So, which is it? The usefulness of bitcoins have absolutely nothing to do with its price, or just a little bit? To not nit-pick and address your argument directly, here are some reasons the utility of bitcoin and its properties may factor into its current price:
The ability to buy and sell goods with bitcoins means that, unlike holding a share of stock or a tulip, they are more liquid. Increased liquidity gives the perceived notion of reduced risk. "Well," a potential bitcoin buyer might say, "if I buy a few bitcoins, at least I can buy goods online, maybe a video game, or even a pizza." The buyer doesn't just have to hold and wait for the price to go up. They are buying something that can be used for more than speculation
Businesses have an interest in receiving bitcoins because they know the probability of a chargeback is dramatically reduced, they don't have to pay 2-4% in transaction fees, and it differentiates them from their competitors, which can be especially favorable in the 20 - 35 male demographic. This increased adoption can lead to increased interest ("What is this bitcoin thing you say you accept?!"). In this scenario, bitcoin's usefulness yields interest. Increased interest may lead to increased demand. I think this is definitely happening and plays role in the market.
What about the guy who offered up his house in exchange for bitcoin, or the story about the Porsche for 300 btc (can you believe it, less than 10k miles on a Cayman!). You don't think these stories breed interest and demand? Bitcoin made these transactions easily possible and secure. I would call that use that yielded interest, and thus increased demand.
So, I ask you this: if bitcoin adoption was widespread, I am talking being able to get a sausage mcmuffin at Micky d's, buy a condom in your local dive bar's bathroom, pay for a round of laser tag, buy a beer, etc. **would its price be influenced any different than it is now?**
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:08:54
I am also having issues. I transferred a decent amount of bitcoins to another address, and after 5 hours, I have 0 confirmations. I'm not sure if it's a problem with blockchain.info sending them out or the network is having issues?
@_date: 2013-06-03 01:30:20
[Watch this]( and [listen to this](
Bitcoin has some unique characteristics that give it inherit value. Such as:
* The basic ability to store and transfer monetary wealth without a middle man or institution.
* No government can ever confiscate your Bitcoins (but if you are careless, they may be stolen from you by hackers).
* It's more anonymous than using credit, but probably a bit less so than using cash.
* It's the democratization of money. People regard it as the Internet of money.
But, most of its value comes from it being an investment vehicle. Bitcoin is treated more as an asset right now than anything else. A lot of people bought, and are still buying BTC, in hopes that it will dramatically increase in value over the coming years. 
If Bitcoin is ultimately successful, meaning that it is used daily to move around big money, its price will necessarily have to be dramatically higher. I think a lot if its value comes from that.

Bitcoin's price is already manipulated often (maybe not daily, but at least weekly). DDoS attacks, fake floors/ceilings, dark pools, bogus news about impending attacks. Bitcoin's growth will be coupled with ever-increasing [attempted] price manipulation. Especially so since Bitcoin is almost completely unregulated.
Placing puts and calls are only a stone's throw away.

Yes, incrementally. CampBX offers AON and dark pool orders, but their orderbook is so thin it doesn't matter much.

@_date: 2013-04-07 09:05:37
Mt. Gox is probably the most battle-tested exchange at this point. Their experience dealing with DDoS attacks, a wave of new accounts, record-breaking volume, and security breaches has probably helped them evolve into the safest and most robust Bitcoin exchange. I like to think their partnership with Coinlab will only make them even more robust.
I fear if another exchange received an influx of new users, they may find themselves unprepared and fall victim to the same issues Mt. Gox has had to deal with. In short, I think Mt. Gox is the least likely to "fall" because of their experience. Hackers probably haven't seriously attacked any other exchanges because there is less to be looted.
But, I agree with you. Using different exchanges only breeds competition, which is good for all of us.

**I am cross-posting this from because I think some will find it valuable in this subreddit as well.**
I am happy to share with you guys a mobile web app I have been building
that allows you to see the Mt. Gox orderbook on your phone.
As we all know, a BTC ticker can only tell us so much about what's going on in the market.
This web app is meant primarily for smartphones, but I have been [using it in
conjuction with Clark's site on my workstation]( to double check the depth. Clark uses a 
different method to update his book and sometimes it shows orders that no longer exist 
and vice-versa.
I have tried make this mobile orderbook work on as many phones as possible.
If your phone supports open websockets, the app will [display a dot in the top-right corner](
* A gray dot means your phone has open websocket support, but you aren't connected.
* A green dot means you are connected to Mt. Gox's data stream.
* A red dot means you have been disconnected.
The main advantage of the websocket is that your ticker will update in real-time as trades occur.
If your phone does not support websockets, the app will manually check Mt. Gox every 5 seconds for the last price.
Regardless of your phone's support for websockets, the orderbook updates every 60 seconds. When new orderbook data is being retrieved, [a loading twurl appears in the top-left corner]( At somepoint in the future, I will have the orderbook update in real-time, but I just wanted to get this out there as I think it provides value in its current state.
If you have an iPhone, you can save it as a web app by [tapping the box with an arrow coming out of it at the bottom of Safari]( Once the options appear, tap '[Add to Homescreen]( (I just call it 'Orderbook') and you will get a [convenient little icon on your homescreen]( that launches the web app.
I know this is possible on Androids too, but I don't know the exact process.
If this web app does not function properly on your smartphone, please send me a message with the following info:
* Your phone's make and model
* The current software version its running on
* The web browser you are using to access the orderbook
Thank you and I hope you guys like it.
**The next feature I am looking to add is the ability to switch currency.**

There is definitely some abrasive and piercing truth in your words, but bitcoins are no doubt extremely useful. Eventually, they just may be the most disruptive force the likes of Visa/Mastercard, Western Union and Moneygram, have ever seen.

I didn't get the JavaScript error, but my transaction sent without a fee too. Blockchain.info usually automatically adds txn fees, right? It's not like Mt. Gox where you have to manually check a transaction-fee checkbox when withdrawing.
My hunch is maybe their script that automatically adds a fee to outgoing transactions failed, and our transactions were put out into the network without fees. But still, even transactions without fees included confirm in a reasonable amount of time.

When there was over 57 minutes of trading lag on their servers yesterday, I thought for sure it was an attack. I contacted them and they said it was their engine clogging up. Growing pains... I appreciate their honesty.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:52:13
I think exploiting the crashes are the best bet. It's easier now that the trading engine doesn't get so clogged up. I literally watch the market all day, whether it be on my phone or out of the corner of my eye while I'm designing. It's really not a healthy habit.
It's easier with smaller amounts. Imagine if I was trying to do what I did with 300 Bitcoins instead of 30. There's just not enough liquidity. I usually just throw around 5 or 10.
If there is a small bid-ask spread (&lt; $1) and strong support going up and down, don't even try. Might as well hit up Satoshi Circle at that point. Just kidding. Never gamble.

@_date: 2013-03-28 21:43:56
I don't know specifically what the issue is, but Mt. Gox's lag is due to their insufficient infrastructure. Whatever the bottlenecks are, they cannot handle medium-level trading volume (which is unacceptable, but we don't have much of a choice right now).
A lot of people are just sitting and watching 
[bitcoinity.org]( and [clarkmoody]( When the transaction table freezes up, people holding BTC start to get a bit worried. They wait a bit, staring... waiting... hitting the refresh button... neither chart seems to be updating.. And then all of a sudden a huge waterfall of red arrows and sale orders come pouring out. "Oh shit," they think to themselves "I better protect my capital!" And a sell off begins.
I know most on this subreddit have seen that massive rush of red arrows flying vertically on bitcoinity. We all know that feeling.
I think you nailed it by referring to the occurrence as a feedback loop.
Someone places a large and legitimate (non-panicky) sell order and Mt. Gox chokes up, the pages stop updating, people get worried, they see a sell off, maybe hold out for a minute, and then the lag gets really bad, they decide it's not worth the risk to hold, and sell.
Chicken and the egg.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:23:37
Because it's not John's money anymore. He gave it to Stacy. It's worth more because he single-handedly shot up the price of BTC and sparked a rally.

I think the three main reasons volume has fallen so low are:
* The bubble popped.
* The bubble popped.
* The bubble popped.
It's just not as easy to turn 5k into 20k right now. So, the allure of Bitcoin has waned. A lot of people cashed out, a lot of people left the market with their tail between their legs, and many are just holding.
I do not find it worrying because the last 60 days in the Bitcoin sphere have been ridiculously tumultuous. Huge price gains, blockchain fork, Mt. Gox getting hacked, Mt. Gox trading engine clogging up because of record-breaking trade levels, and the most violent price swings I have ever seen (after the crash).
I think we are due for some calm. Bitcoin can't party everyday of the week.


Did you watch the latest 110 wall come down? I literally saw 10,000 BTC in market buys, everytime 109-110 was cleared, a few rich fellows would throw up some new 1,000+ BTC walls, which also got eaten up. It was nuts. There are still spikes of activity, I think we will see more of them soon. BTC volume was as low as 13,000 when the price was $47 (post blockchain fork recovery I assume).
Bitcoin has been rising steadily over the last week. It just hasn't been rising *wildly*. There are still more people buying than selling right now.
Overall interest in Bitcoin has fallen (when compared to the last 60 days)
* Google Trends for 'bitcoin' significantly down: 
* Bitcoinity 'connected users' down by 60-80% from 10k+: 
* The growth and activity of this subreddit tapering off (see 'Subscriber Growth This Month'): 
We may soon have an upward breakout if the current divergence trend continues...
Being that the code is open source, and a legion of ubernerds have unsuccessfully tried to hack/crack/manipulate it in anyway possible and have only been left wanting, I am not too worried. The infrastructure of Bitcoin is sound. I have yet to come across any formidable argument against it outside of a pool getting too much hashing power.
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:39:09
It wasn't pulled. Please see [this screenshot](
Each candlestick represents a minute. Each corresponding volume bar, at the bottom, also represents a minute (you can see M1 is selected). When the ~10k BTC market sell was placed, it didn't cause the price to go below ~$126.50. This means **there was significant downward resistance due to large bid orders**. If the large bid had been pulled, as you say, the price would have dropped to about ~122 on that candlestick.
Although what you are talking about does happen, somewhat frequently, it did not occur in this instance.

@_date: 2013-03-30 03:05:58
Exactly. Someone placed a few enormous bids. The market reacted immediately, trying to buy in before the price skyrocketed (before the crazy large buy orders executed). The same dude who placed these phony humongo orders probably sold into that strength, making great profits. Demand was artificially created and now the price is artificially inflated (temporarily). There are a lot of people uttering WTFs to themselves right now.
@_date: 2013-06-01 02:37:20
What you are seeing is a cached version of Clark's orderbook from a few hours ago. The site loads the market depth once initially, then uses Gox's streaming WebSocket API to collate to new orders as they are placed. Meaning, Clark only reloads the order book at a minimum of once per hour (it could be much longer than that) and your browser most likely just uses the cached data.
I double and triple check market depth by using [Bitcoinity's visual graph]( and [Bitcoin Charts](
@_date: 2013-06-01 00:58:48
Usually large price floors do push the price up. 
Imagine you have a bid for 10 BTC at $126.90. 
You are thinking there is a very a good chance your order will be fulfilled soon. But then, another bid is placed at $127.00 for 7,900 BTC.
Holy crap.
Now, someone holding BTC (or a pool of bearish holders) needs to execute a market sell order for at least 7,900 BTC for your order to be fulfilled. This is extremely unlikely for two reasons.
* The 7,900 bid shows extremely strong demand, especially with a few bids under the $127 for over 1,500 BTC (See [126.5]( [125.21]( [125.00]( Why sell if the market looks as though it will be moving upwards soon?
* The bid for 7,900 BTC is ~48% of the trailing 24-hour volume of ~16,250. There is, on average lately, just not that much liquidity on Mt. Gox.
Since it's super unlikely now that your bid of 10 BTC @ 126.90 will be filled, you have to **move your order above** the large floor at 127 to make it more likely. Now someone may only need to sell a few hundred BTC for your bid to be filled. But, the act of you moving your bid to $127.01 from $126.90, because of the 7,900 BTC floor at $127.00, is in essence how large floors may induce upward price movement.
I hope that makes sense.
I give more credence to the 7,900 BTC floor than I do to the ones at 126.50 and 125.10. They were both pulled earlier today when they were getting close to fulfillment.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:08:35
I have used them four times for depositing funds directly into my Gox account ($500 per deposit). One time my deposit got lost, I emailed Erik directly, it was resolved within an hour after that. The other three times went perfectly.

There exists windows of opportunity when day trading is more probable to yield gains. My goal is simply to increase the amount of BTC I have **without using any new funds** and only by anticipating market fluctuations and playing the bid-ask spread.
Here is my transaction history from yesterday. Scroll all the way to the bottom and work your way up. 
[ ( 'Outs' are sales, 'Ins' are buys )
It took awhile, but I was able to convert 29 BTC to just over 31. That may not seem like a lot, but shooting for 2 BTC gains per transaction when only playing with ~3,500 USD is unrealistic.
I am posting this just to show that it can be done. Clark Moody is a phenomenal tool in predicting extremely short-term market swings. I don't even try to play the market if his site is down. I don't use bitcoinity. Sometimes, I leave it up on my TV while reading or something.
If you want to try and gain some BTC, start by playing the crashes. You can see from my txn history, that I got the biggest single gain from yesterday's crash.
Crashes are by the far the easiest time to garner free BTC (and quite a lot of it too). The herd is so predictable after Gox experiences downtime. The key is selling in the very very beginning, if the selloff has been happening for more than 3 minutes, you have missed your chance. Don't sell at this point because the price is going to rebound soon and you'll just end up giving away your BTC. I place market orders during a crash, I see a lot of people placing limits orders and they just get passed up. Crashes usually involve lag, so you only know where the market was 50+ seconds ago. Buy back when the crash beings to taper, if it's already rebounding, you are late, place a market buy order.
Day trading is much more difficult. I will try doing a screencast next time there is a good opportunity. The strategy is organic and quick; it would be hard to detail it in a bulleted list.
Edit: Ahhh crap... the gain amount on Trade 5 is incorrect, it should be +~0.046 or so. Haste so often yields mistakes.
Edit 2: Fixed the screenshot.

I agree with you 100%. My post was getting so wordy as it is, I didn't delve into this.
People trying to manipulate the market, usually with orders between 1,000 and 2,000 BTC, will park their bid/ask either right below or above another semi-large order, say 200 - 600 BTC, just incase someone does try to call their bluff, they have a buffer zone that allows for an increased amount of time to cancel their order. And if their order starts getting eaten up, they will cancel it ASAP.
The closer a sizely bid/ask is to the current price when it is placed usually correlates with its "realness."
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:23:52
It is absolutely relevant. 
Imagine a scenario where John wants to send 5,000,000 USD to Stacy. Instead of using a bank wire, John decides to try out this new-fangled Bitcoin thing. For the sake of brevity, let's assume John has no problem getting his fat stacks into Mt. Gox. It's going to take forever for a 52,000 BTC floor @ $95 to be eaten up, so John has to place a market buy order. This pushes the price of a Bitcoin from $95 to $135 USD in less than 30 seconds.
Holy crap! The market becomes bullish and everyone wants to get in on the action. The price would probably exceed $150 after this monster buy order.
For the short term, this puts John at a loss, now his 52k BTC are worth maybe 5,500,000 USD. Stacy is like well you wanted to bypass the international wire transfer, so, your loss!
Now Stacy needs to convert her ungodly amount of Bitcoins back into USD. The next day she does a market sell order and pushes the price down from $150 to $100.
Mt. Gox lags up, the market freaks out, and a selloff occurs after Stacy liquidates. 
I think it's evident how this situation is less than ideal.
If people can't even convert 5MM to BTC without the market going crazy, Bitcoin will never succeed. Legitimate and mainstream businesses are less likely to accept BTC because they constantly need to fear wild price fluctuations. Accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment before the bubble popped was more appetizing because they were receiving payment in something that was predictably increasing in value. Now... that's less certain.
So how can Bitcoin absorb these large transactions without notably manipulating the price? A very high market cap. (You could increase the amount in circulation too, but that's a different argument.)
Bitcoin is so cheap and premature that one rich guy could just buy all the Bitcoins available. The more expensive a Bitcoin is, the harder it is for any one individual or institution to move the price around. I could dump 10k right now and move the price up ~76 cents. As a currency, that's unacceptable.
Stable prices yield confidence, confidence in a currency increases the likelihood it will be used, and I think widespread use is characteristic of "success."

It's highly likely that it *is* a single order. People would be leap frogging each other (127.00001, 127.00011) to ensure their bids were executed first. I also saw it placed all at once. You think a bunch of people just haphazardly decided to place a million dollars worth of BTC orders at the same time at the same price?
I would say that is highly unlikely.
Also, 7,900 BTC @ $127 = $1,003,300
Minus fees, that's about 1 million exactly. Looks like a single and well-thought-out bid.

Bitcoin may not be directly mentioned, but I think Schiff's opinions and insights into how western countries have been managing their currencies, as of late, indirectly endorses diversifying high liquidity assets.
Also, I think everyone on this subreddit should be familiar with Schiff's sentiments. It's the growing interest in these beliefs that are, at least in part, helping fuel Bitcoin's growth.
Is there a rule that any posts to this subreddit must explicitly mention Bitcoin? I did not see the rule in the sidebar, and if so, my bad.

I see little-to-no benefit from the partnership either.
**Here's what CoinLab has to offer Mt. Gox (according to CoinLab):**


**Did CoinLab help Gox facilitate deposits made via Dwolla or bank wires? If not, I am  assuming that CoinLab was planning on implementing support for ACH transfers.**


**Ok, sure, [but what does that mean](
**Not only would CoinLab get US and Canada exclusivity, but also this no-longer-in-business stipulation of sweetness**


**Can anyone concretely elaborate on what CoinLab is/was supposed to bring to the table, beyond ACH transfers and a credibility boost?**

If you are going to attempt to trade for gain, you need to define a goal. Do you want to increase your USD or BTC holdings? 
Selling your BTC in the early stages of a selloff is an easy way to pickup some extra Bitcoins, but the dollar value of your holdings may temporarily, or permanently, decrease. If you see the market dropping like a rock, get into your Mt. Gox account and place a market sell order immediately, don't be an idiot and place a limit order. You are 10+ minutes behind reality and there is a strong chance you will miss your target. Once your market sell order has executed, decide how many BTC you want to try and pickup during the selloff. This part is tricky, don't be greedy, I usually shoot for just a couple BTC. If you are lucky and your buy order executes, don't go repeating this process on the same selloff. You have accomplished your goal of increasing your BTC. The market could reverse at anytime. I understand that today was an exception to this rule.
Increasing your USD holdings is much easier because, up until today, all Bitcoin has done is go up. So, you are already making solid daily gains. If this your goal, I strongly recommend not trying to day trade. You may get lucky a couple times, but it only takes one asshole to come in and place a market order for 1,500 BTC either way to completely distort your projection.
I know looking at the graphs of days past makes day trading look easy, but in a market as volatile and unknown as Bitcoin, it's nearly impossible to do regularly and achieve predictable gains.
The best tip I can offer you is to look for the DDoS attacks (yes, they are happening). If you notice 10-15+ minutes of lag and the ticker sites are running like crap, get out of BTC ASAP. If you're wrong, quickly buy back in, eat your loss, and wait for the next opportunity (selloff). 
The market is only predictable when speculators and longs are moving in the same direction.

Generating a private key on a virtual machine, that is offline, is probably the safest place to store your coins. Obviously, this is not conducive to frequent trading. Mt. Gox is inherently less secure than a cold wallet. But, I think it's more secure than any other exchange right now, because of their experience dealing with attacks. 
As far as USD goes, if someone hacked your account and initiated a transfer, you would probably have a decent time window to contact Mt. Gox and cancel the nefarious transaction. A hacker is more likely to buy BTC with your funds, and then immediately transfer to one of their addresses.
Another caveat with having large amounts of USD in Mt. Gox deals with a worst-case scenario. If the price of a Bitcoin crashed spectacularly fast, a large majority of Mt. Gox accounts will convert their BTC to USD as quickly as possible. Mt. Gox could then be bombarded with a huge influx of withdrawal requests, so much so, they could just run out of money altogether. Similar to the idea that if everyone went to the bank at the same time and tried to withdraw their funds, the bank simply wouldn't be able to honor their customers' credits.
Overall, I think you are okay. Be sure to enable your yubikey not only for accessing your account, but for any USD or BTC withdraws as well. If we can't trust Mt. Gox to securely hold our funds at this point, Bitcoin will take a catastrophic blow.

It's good to know you are at least interested in *some* illegal activity!
Relatively safe investments yield anywhere from 3% to 8% a year, after that you are going to start to take on some risk. Riskier assets, like emerging market growth funds, can yield annual return as high as 35%, or greater. And we all know individual stocks run the gamut.
If you buy $1,000 of bitcoins today (~7 BTC), they are probably going to be worth at least $1,250 by next weekend. If you find that holding BTC for a week was too stressful, sell your BTC (there will be plenty of people happy to take them off your hands) and walk away knowing that you made a great ROI. Also, take some joy in knowing you dipped your feet in the newest and greatest thing since the Internet! (Ok, that's a bit pedantic, I know).
If you decide to use a significant amount of your money to buy BTC, you need to be prepared for a wild ride. The price will be going up and down a lot on a daily basis, although, weekends are usually tame. There will be large corrections (sell offs, realizations of gains, etc) in the coming weeks, possibly as much as 50% (O_O). The people that bought 20,000 BTC at $70 are going to be looking to reduce their risk profile by taking some gains.
Bitcoin for the long haul is an unknown, but given the current situation of many western countries being nearly insolvent and printing money to deter currency crash, I think Bitcoin is either sailing into, or out of, the perfect storm.
