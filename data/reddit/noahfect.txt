I don't understand that.  Does Snowden think he'll catch an even break from the Trump camp?

It's simple once you realize the truth.  Reporters are people who weren't quite good enough at writing fiction to find anyone else who would pay them for it.

*Let me tell you what: go down to Somalia.*
You know, it occurs to me that this is the sort of thing someone says when they hear an argument that they don't have a ready answer for.

The question of exactly where rights come from becomes a very important one when someone claims that the state holds the "legitimate monopoly on violence."  You can't be too surprised when you receive downvotes after making the latter claim without considering the former question.
In the apparent absence of a God to guarantee our basic rights as human beings, it seems unwise for us as individuals to grant *anyone* -- much less the US government! -- a monopoly on the use of force.  A similar argument can be made for currency.

Here's a clue for all the Linux fanboys out there: if the only way Bitcoins can be stored safely is on a machine running a specific (and nonstandard) desktop OS, Bitcoin does not have a bright future.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:56:01


It's unthinkable, in this case.   I was sitting at the machine at the time, installing a huge Xilinx software package.  I happened to glance at the Bitcoin client after the installation finished, and noticed the transaction had happened about an hour earlier.
There *is* a RealVNC server on this machine with a pretty good but not awesomely-obscure password, so I've changed that PW and put it on a nonstandard port.  That's pretty high on my list of suspicions.  The new machine I'm setting up for bank/financial stuff won't be remotely accessible at all.
I agree that the rounded quantity is weird.  I'm going to leave the BT client running for a while to see if any other shenanigans happen.  Not much left to lose at this point...

Also, about that $55 million deposit you're expecting from Lagos, I'm afraid there has been a minor delay.

Good point, I do have a Dropbox account but the wallet file isn't on any directories linked to it.

I dunno.  Many so-called investigative journalists have had feet of clay.  For every Daniel Ellsberg blowing the whistle on a genuine scandal, there were two or three assclowns staging truck fires, clutching their pearls over runaway Audis, or "war corresponding" from the rougher side of the Brooklyn Bridge.

Sorry, bro, but anything with &lt; 10% market share is "nonstandard."
It's not the least bit useful to suggest using Linux instead of Windows as a means of keeping one's Bitcoin wallet more secure.  What it *does* accomplish is making both Bitcoin and Linux look bad.

Then, as I said elsewhere, Bitcoin is doomed and those coins weren't going to be worth anything anyway.  Don't shoot the messenger.

Yes, Windows 7 x64, all patches up to date, behind NAT.  I don't use IE and would respectfully suggest that the choice of OS by itself has nothing to do with anything.

It was mostly a collection of cliches, stereotypes, and logical fallacies that would get me (justifiably) crucified if I used similar ones to argue with you.

No, it wasn't encrypted.  The fact that the wallet wasn't drained entirely makes me think the file was obtained a couple of days before it was used to grab the loot.  If you subtract a couple of the small deposits from Middlecoin you get a number pretty close to (but not exactly equal to) zero.  
The last time I was hacked was when I accidentally opened an attachment with happy99.exe, so it's kind of a bummer to end a 15-year incident free run, with Windows, no less. :-P  I don't really give a crap about the $4K+ worth of BTC, but not knowing the attack vector freaks me *way* the hell out.  Definitely a splash of cold water to the face.

It's not as if the morons chanting "LOL WINDOWS SUX USE LUNIX INSTEAD!!1!!" are *wrong*, per se, but they aren't correctly identifying the likely problem that I ran into.  They're just advocating security by obscurity, which works great until it doesn't.  Blaming Adobe or Sun/Oracle for their endless parade of zero-day security holes is probably more reasonable.  
Most likely, I opened a .PDF I shouldn't have, or granted permission to run a Java app that I thought was safe but wasn't.  The Windows versions of these tools are the most heavily targeted for hacks, simply because they're the most common.  I doubt that will change anytime soon.  The right thing to do is probably to keep financial and other sensitive info on a completely separate machine, Windows or otherwise, that is never used for anything else. Full admin rights on that machine should never be used after initial setup.  That's going to be my own strategy, going forward.  Sloppy, overconfident practices are more of a hazard than the choice of OS, any day of the week.

Nothing unusual in the WinVNC4 event log.  No access attempts except from my own LAN and cell phone.  Doesn't necessarily mean anything, of course, since if someone has pwned RealVNC they can do whatever they want with the log.

Patents don't work that way.  If Coinbase used and/or documented the technology in question before anyone else, then neither PayPal nor Mastercard nor anyone else could have filed patents on it.
By far the vast majority of things that could be patented aren't.  Good thing, too, or we'd be living in the Stone Age.

Exactly.  If targeted by a patent troll with a warchest like, say, Nathan Myhrvold's, your company can be "dead right."

Well, yes, it does become more difficult.  Not only does it become less rewarding as the subsidy falls, but the hash target also decreases.
