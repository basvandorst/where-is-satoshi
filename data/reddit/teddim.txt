I think that may be the point of no return.

I think they're saying that people will trade using atomic swaps rather than using a centralised exchange.

It's actually spelled macOS, I thought that was what you were referring to.

I know this is an old thread, but anyway: so if you make a transaction, it includes both your public key (which can be verified by hashing it and comparing it to your address) and a signature signed with your private key (which can be verified with the public key)? Is my understanding correct?

That bot isn't active here :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:25
CAD, or something?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:38:48
You spent $50 when it was at $2800? Or the other way around?

It's a foolproof plan!

It has actually gotten a lot of people very far, financially.

I think that's true for most emojis :) It's not strictly necessary, but it might speed up the adoption of crypto currencies, given that emojis are quite popular.

It actually stands for Hopefully One Day: Lamborghini.

You spent whatever it was worth then, not what it's worth now. Literally anyone could have been a millionaire by now if they had the right information – there's no need for you to feel bad just because you happened to have used BTC in the past to pay for things. :)

We gotta hurry!

iirc they got in at a way higher price than that.

How'd you lose it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:07
Not trying to be a Bitcoin hater (I own BTC myself), but you could always give a different coin. I get why you'd rather give BTC though, since it's the only cryptocurrency a lot of people know.

How would you land on the moon without hitting it, though?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:10:49
One bit? Or one bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:57
Better yet, who sold?
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:36:13
Possibly a dumb question, but won't BCH be able to implement the LN once BTC has it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:05:56
I think the Bitcoin logo would lend itself pretty well as an emoji.

Why is the price displayed by GDAX so much higher than on other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:05:54
They really don't own most of them, though. But I agree with you otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:49
GDAX went above $19.6k very briefly.

I bought some BTC today, I'm all about that 1X.
