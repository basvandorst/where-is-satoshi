Merry Xmas!
I'm looking forward to seeing what effect the reward halving will have on the market in 2016!

Ah yes, I was thinking about buying some more. I better not, otherwise the price will drop back lower than before.

Nice. I'm going to use that.

Without the public key, how does the network know its a valid transaction?
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:16:40
The blockchain is not necessarily only for *peers who do not trust each other*.
Within a private network, the benefit of using blockchain technology is to remove the need for central processing of transactions... see 'Byzantine General's Problem', which is about networks coping with the failure of one or more of its components.

Is selling a bad idea if you can buy back tomorrow for even less?

Is it a virus? While the link says reddit.com, I notice that it has http and not https.

I offer 25% off my software product...

Good on ya!

I guess you could call it a... bitcoincidence 
@_date: 2016-05-15 11:20:50
It would seem more credible if it was one of Google, yahoo and Microsoft rather than all three.
Not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin in any case.

I don't really understand what the issue is here? Isn't blocking spam a good thing? I'm not arguing for or against, just asking the question so I can understand.
