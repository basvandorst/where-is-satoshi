Just a quick question about lightning
Since the transactions aren’t occurring on chain where is the information stored, is it still the same public ledger where every transaction is visible?

Right so if there were 5 people on the channel sending a bunch of random payments to all parties, once channel is closed only the end balance would be known and not any of the transactions. Does this mean lightning can effectively be used as a way to keep transactions hidden from the general public as no one knows who sent who what?

Let’s say there was an open channel with 5 people and I sent you a btc and you sent it back, would it be impossible to determine who funds were transferred from and to?

Let’s say I send you a bitcoin and then you send it back to me and the end balances are the same, the channel is closed, is there then any trace of me sending you money if the end balances are the same

So let’s see if I have this correctly. Once the Channel is closed ALL transaction made on the lightning network is the logged into the main chain?

Oh sweet that means lightning actually improves privacy of transactions 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:57:09
So does this make lightning transactions private? Or is it still public

What should I use instead that has easy UI

The bank was just a crappy example, obviously there are protections in place but the point still stands, unforeseeable circumstances aren't something normal people take into account. He had money in liquid assets and now they're frozen. 
Better example would have been if a bank froze his account for no reason

Are you seriously shitting on him for something unexpected? It's like saying "oh your bank burnt down and you lost your money? well shouldn't have gambled your money"
