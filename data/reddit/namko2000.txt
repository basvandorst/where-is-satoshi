Does anyone know a BT2 / B2X futures whale? If seems it became a small dolphin in 1 day :P

Impressive! I bet it will be $10,000 in 2 weeks tops.

I think all of crypto will benefit from this. Bitcoin and all of crypto are going to mone into our everyday lives. Björk announcing you could buy her album with BTC, LTC, AudioCoin and Dash is good news as well. And let's not forget Lili Allen regrets (now she's big suppoeter of bitcoin) :)

If the panic hits, we could see that scenario unfold. Look at MT. Gox. Nobody thought bitcoin could drop by that much. And if bitcoin gets screwed, the whole crypto gets screwed.

Bitcoin Silver is not worth much, don't have high expectations:  
I'd buy Bitcoin just for Bitcoin :) My bet we hit $10,000 by February, if not before.

I think it will happen sooner. The news will be priced-in even before that. When institutions pour their money in, we go to the moon!

Great! Will they add ETH as well? Or the top 10 coins by market cap:

What do you think will happen after the BTG fork? Will is go back to $5000 or continue to go toward $10,000? My bet is that it will drop and altcoins will rise heavily soon after the fork is done.

This is strange. Bitcoin at ATH, Chinese miners selling their mining gear. If this gets serious, it might disrupt the current positive emotion around bitcoin or am I missing something?
