Please tell me my sell order went through over the past few days...

So who would everyone recommend?

So the money that was "hacked" and stolen was actually seized by the US government? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 22:12:23
Ah, gotcha. Thanks!

I was still able to vote. Did RES allow this?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:53:44
Answer: wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:22:42
Ah, that makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to explain.

If MtGox gets their shit together and their site online.

Unless you're cute. And a girl. And have huuuuuuugggee tracts of land.

Also, the market was on the way back up when it went down. It had already dropped to $96 and when the site crashed it was right around $111.

I didn't search the previous threads but I did scroll down a few pages and didn't see anyone asking, probably because everyone is downvoting them (like this one). Obviously it's just theories but there are some pretty smart people on Reddit who might have some good ideas and see some telling points. I am not going to base my decision on that and I believe Bitcoins are NO where close to dead. But for those who missed the boat as early adopters will get a chance to get in at (close to) the same rates as the early adopters. Again, Bitcoin will rebound.

Just used an alt account with IE (no RES) to vote, went back to Chrome and refreshed, and it counted the vote. So that ruled out RES and confirmed that it is working... Hmmm...

Right, I understand that it won't be MtGox setting prices, I realize that part was worded REALLY badly. But I agree with your answer, MtGox will quickly drop to everyone else's going rate.
