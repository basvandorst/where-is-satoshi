At least longer than it would take for all clients to accept bigger blocks
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:05:02
1 month+, I would say its actually 3 month+
@_date: 2016-04-18 23:57:45
What is csv?
And dont worry, HF is tested, I would be more worried about Segwit cause latest news like that 
Ok if you want lightning, fine. But there are other people around and bitcoin and lightning are 2 different things and should be working ideally without affecting the other ones function. Plus it doesnt necessarily delay segwit, to be honest segwit activation is actually still far away( I expect 3+ months), HF before would be still very possible imo(takes only 1 month)
@_date: 2016-04-13 21:00:04
You said that the chief scientist of the bitcoin foundation is a troll, so why you even expect a response from all those trolls? Dont feed em
The only thing needed is that you submit some shiny new code to scale bitcoin well since you seem to be the perfect person for that. In case you really are, pls contact me, Ill put my money where my mouth is and pay you really well.
And btw its better to repeat all the arguments that should be seriously considered than just calling someone with a clearly better understanding a troll.
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:56:36
Why do you think its fast and effortless? Every client has to implement a lot of code, compared to increasing the block size limits its anything than effortless.
@_date: 2016-04-19 15:16:09


Ofcourse, companies like coinbase/blockchain like to use/support untested software. What thing is exactly not tested?


RemindMe! 2 months "Segwit still isnt there, you are wrong"


I agree, it needs consensus and it will get sooner or later(core wants to HF too), as its ready Im still waiting for you telling me why it shouldnt be theoretically done now.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:50:44
Why exactly do we pay a 15℅ Fee for lending then if there isn't any security for the funds?
@_date: 2016-04-18 22:22:00
Can we bet that segwit isnt deployed in 1 month? Betting all I have.
The path is wrong imo, take a look here and see that segwit takes time  and consensus isnt clear either. So we should HF first, then SF with segwit as its more safe.
@_date: 2016-04-13 20:46:52
Yeah if blocks get even more full its your own fault when you dont want to send a tx with 15 usd fee? Get your head examined, its not the same if the appropriate fee changes, its bad. Or would it be also same experience if the transfer of your paycheck costs you 500$ instead of 0$? 
@_date: 2016-04-18 22:11:42


You entirely missed the point, I just wanted to point out that your timeframes dont make any sense. Which one is better doesnt depend on how old the idea is.


If the blocksize increase has consensus, it wont, so you never know.


Its activasion depends on unanimity, not the other way. Thats why its imo at least more safe than segwit, you never know if everyone did the hard work to implement it and it depends on client update too.


That was just correcting your argument about the timeframes.(so blame yourself) You basically said the idea of segwit came up later than the blocksize increase, so it has to be better. So I said if you want to argue with timeframes, it would make sense to have a look at the time it would need to activate it.
And yeah the debate is about whats best for bitcoin, since blocksize increase is ready and hasnt any rational disadvantage, I think it would be the best way. How good an idea is hasnt to do sth with the support of the idea. If most would support raising the upper bound of btc supply to 42m, does that make it a good idea?
Beside that Bitcoin Core planned already to hardfork after segwit, so if you are on their side pls explain me why we shouldnt doing blocksize increase first(since its effortless, more secure) and segwit later to give devs more time.
@_date: 2016-04-18 03:28:07
why? not every client has proper segwit implementation...
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:13:31
You are correct, but please tell me what it means about the btc experience if you previously had to pay much less fee(or even no fee) for faster confirmation than now. Its **exactly** the same solid experience, right?
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:37:46
Thanks for admitting that it isnt the same solid experience, else you wouldnt have to play with fees. And please also note, its just the beginning of block being full, as transaction volume is very likely to increase it will get even more worse over the time.
@_date: 2016-04-19 15:01:04
Again, I dont bring timeframe arguments, you were the one argueing it is only 1 month away. I just corrected you.

My question to you first:
*Fast forward to now. Bitcoin is running as solidly as always*
Have you used btc in the past weeks? No? You would have noticed that transactions take ages to confirm which is *a big problem*
@_date: 2016-04-19 15:40:43


They generally agree with HF, they dont want it now as the "vast majority of bitcoin developers" are paid by blockstream, so they are looking forward to implementing things benefitting lightning first. Those who arent paid by blockstream(gavin, jeff eg) prefer HF first, as it would be the best for bitcoin if you leave out blockstreams interests.


Thats why the blocksize limit isnt removed, its just lifted. Effect wont be noticeable at all @ 2 MB and is nothing in contrast to full blocks. 
Beside that, Segwit if its really deployed in 1 month will hurt bitcoin more, as everyone needs to update their client/implement new things which isnt done now or just in 1 month. So fixing urgent things first and giving developers more time for smooth segwit deploy makes more sense imo.
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:48:49
Whats the source of the 12 month figure? Blockchain size was unlimited, so if you mean since somebody came up with the idea/code its like 6 years, so its meaningless.
What does 5 months means? the same, exactly nothing, because its not active and you state yourself rollout over the next few months. No one knows how long it takes. Take a look at the adoption  most arent ready yet
Blocksize increase in contrast is completely ready, and could be active in 1 month, since switch is really effortless ( companies have proven its possible to do it in &lt;4 days, have a look at the segwit adoption and see the difference), so Id say **1 month &gt; next few months**

You know your argument is useless if it still applies when you reverse it.
You could also say: judging the fails listed there, Core Devs/Supporters shouldnt teach BU about quality / competency.
Roger Ver happily tossed the loss because BU built a client which follows his beliefs and fixed the issue quickly, so pls dont argue about the impact of those fails. In fact you can also see it like this:

seems like this a myth going around here, read this 


Core stated beside HK agreement that they wont do blocksize increas
e. So you want to deploy Segwit and afterwards tell them to fuck themselves and support BU? I wouldnt think thats bad, but I doubt thats what you wanna do.


I agree, maybe there should be a [IM ONLY IN FOR MONEY] at the top of the post, since many idiots treat some upvoted posts as facts.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:39:22
(facepalm) It does NOT increase the blocksize. It can only compress transactions, IF both sides support Segwit. Doesnt look good so far 
Thats why many advocating increasing block size first, and maybe do segwit later. 
In fact Core was once in favor of increasing block size first, but then decided to drop it in order to force anyone to use their LN which not only does not exist and wont be ready soon, but also would be defeatable by 51% attack, so much for decentralization.

If Autodesk improves Maya ( = Bitcoin Network) with an update containing a new 3D Model Format ( = Segwit), which a lot of users cant use in almost every case because they are dependent on some addons (= Bitcoin clients / services) which arent compatible with the new format. Just because the new Format renders 4x as fast, you cant claim your processor (= limiting resource) is running 4x as fast as before. It theoretically just can render 4x as fast in the best case.
So maybe "made up" is not 100% accurate, but Id call it misleading "advertising".

Really stupid comment if you don't have an arguments why
a) small blocks are good
b) why exactly 1mb is perfect, why not 100k or 200k? When small blocks are great, I guess 200k is fine too
c) what's so bad about bigger blocks? (especially when segwit gets promoted as an actual block size increase here, isn't segwit bad then?)
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:06:57


not really, I dont think theres a single miner/mining pool out there with enough power to create a block which isnt aware of the possible fork, I dont see why 99% of the hashpower wouldnt end up in the hard fork chain.
Users would also notice, they would have to upgrade their client anyways for segwit ( else no capacity increase if no one receives and sends segwit txs)
Are you currently using bitcoin and are you fine that you are paying more than for a overpriced paypal transaction?


isnt a great comparison at all, but I have a better one for you:
Core: Bitcoin needs a fee market! Oh? Your Tx arent getting confirmed? No problem just pay ... unlimited fees, could be 0.50$, 5$ (as Core Dev luke-jr suggests) or all of your money. Dont worry, will be fine, we dont want users to upgrade their software, just to upgrade their fee. Anything else would be unsafe and we would risk losing users ( which ofc have all unlimited budget for fees)

Who pays such high fees for spam? Respectfully, your claim is utter horseshit.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:10:32
Re &gt; 10sat/byte: Old wallets could use such fee, used to send tx without fees back in the core 0.10 times. And bitcoin is an open ecosystem, anyone can make his own client with a custom fee.
Look at chart another way: Even if you exclude all &gt; 10 sat/byte tx which would never be confirmed atm, there are still so many **non-spam** transaction which **doesnt get confirmed**.
Im using even Core 0.12.1 and still have 4 transactions stuck while having paid appropiate fee.
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:41:27


But not high priority. And what do you expect to happen if every user pays 20% premium on normal fees? As long users still want to use bitcoin, fees will go to infinity.


It doesnt, it makes just transactions smaller. I dont even have sth against Segwit, but it doesnt solve the scaling issue for longer than 1 year.


You dont need fiber, as I said some nodes theoretically could just leech and/or just connect to 1 node, then you can run at least 2mb just now. Not sure where you live, but bidirectional internet via sattelite or sth should be working.
And for 20-50k you can rent out a 40 USD vps for a pretty long time.


Im travelling often enough to know that you cant have a full node everywhere and in every situation( e.g. Smartphone only with 2G), its fine/it has to be fine when not every device runs a full node or you just remote to your 40 usd vps which could be your home pc in 98% depending on your area.


Can I ask what makes you so sure about that/where you live? 5-10 years is a pretty long time, within such time cell phone towers got installed to cover reasonable areas and there is maybe some innovation like Project Loon.
Beside that your millionaires/neighborhood could put sth like 1m$+ together, pretty sure you could get decent connection for that.


Great, just like Trump I need some (block-) votes to make bitcoin great again, thats why im trying to debunk some bullshit here.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:53:33
Ive read the bitcoin whitepaper and some satoshi posts multiple times, it clearly says that bitcoin should scale fine in the bounds of Moores Law ( yes I know, the law didnt apply in the recent years, we can still handle more than 1mb fine), not something like keeping Blocksize artificially small for no reason ( it was introduced as a temporary fix against spam, you can handle spam also in another way, see Bitpays BIP for example)
I would also remind you that the Core Devs including Borgstream CEO Adam Back were in favor of a block size increase HF and even promised such one in the HK miner agreement, but now all the sudden they seem to forget about that. Im no conspiracy theorist, but many theories have been proven right over the time.
And if you look at the bitcoin classic page  i cant find one classic dev that moved to unlimited. In fact unlimited was developed at the same time as classic.
Even if I dont see any clear proof why unlimited wants to destroy bitcoin, I agree that it might be better if Core+Unlimited devs would be doing a blocksize increase. But thanks to the now hated , there is serious effort and money behind Unlimited now, I think its fine. So far I havent seen anything bad about unlimited except that some believe that the block size should stay at 1MB.
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:07:05
Im in for yes, but lets make the blocksize great again first!
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:00:08
you know that bitcoin classic != bitcoin unlimited?
and that was only in development with no buffer overflow in the release?
Its quite the same as to say Core Devs are incompetent because they had some problems while implementing segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:12:18
Absolutely wrong, take a look at 
And see my other comment why this argument/tweet doesn't make sense
@_date: 2016-11-20 14:48:00


No, but he employs most Bitcoin Core developer in his company Blockstream, which basically controls Bitcoin Core now. (thats why its called Borgstream)


I am aware. But Core Devs promised to implement a blocksize HF, which they didnt do.


Which is so great to do when even the project page tells you that most libraries/companies arent ready for the breaking changes it does to bitcoin : 


That the Hardfork will never be in Bitcoin Core, because they are too focused to ruin bitcoin with Lightning Network theories(it isnt implemented, nobody knows when it is, nobody knows if it will ever work). Segwit is one the things they would need for that. Blockstreams valuation comes from that they want to establish a second layer on top of bitcoin and charging fees for that. This is being told long time on and so far that seems right :)


No, it doesnt increase blocksize. It compresses tx, and for that libraries/companies/software for bitcoin would need to have segwit implemented, which isnt really the case atm. Dont get me wrong, Segwit has some nice things, but it isnt the ultimate scaling solutions since it could provide max size equivalent 1.7mb blocks.


If you dont mean Segwit, they havent, and they wont judging their comments. Else you seem to not know if you are in favor of increase or not.


Partially right, there are numerous things to be improved. But blocksize is most urgent one, since tx fees are skyrocketing, blocks are full, and bitcoin becomes less useable.
Bonus point: its at least a critical issue, which could have been fixed over a year ago with a simple and clean HF.


for what reason? except supporting use of the non existent blockstream lightning network?
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:33:04
You are aware that Segwit is necessary for LN? That nearly all recent features / soft forks benefited LN? And that Segwit isnt actually on chain scaling until all clients support SW, which isnt the case atm?
So judging your argumentation he isnt hurting and he is right :)
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:11:37
github link to it? i guess you are just spreading bullshit
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:54:43
doesnt make the patch of the code unclean or not simple.
And btw take a look at the skyrocketing fees. 2-40 USD for a fee DOESNT make using bitcoin cheap either.
So you can choose between
a) Dont increase blocksize:
Congrats, skyrocketing fees, bitcoin will be only useable for transferring large sums, TX fees would be much higher than a 40usd vps.
b) Increase blocksize:
bandwidth, and average storage in consumer hardware went up, so a 2x increase doesnt change much. But it makes bitcoin transactions cheap again.
Beside that not everyone needs to run a full node, or how do you keep up with for example 2G and 0.34 mbit upload?






Totally, most in those countries couldnt afford the high fees for every transaction with 1mb blocks either. Those who can will certainly have a good connection.
**Also: not every client need to upload to 8 other nodes, those countries could just *leech* from other nodes, the required donwload speeds are just fine**
And yeah as I said, full node is even now not practically for many situations, wouldnt change a thing. In those countries its normal to just have a smartphone, not even a PC, so I would guess 80% couldnt even run a 1 MB full node.
*(beside in Syria you couldnt run too)*


Yeah then just skip Segwit, HF and Make Bitcoin Great Again.
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:48:31


See my other comment


That's not "Core devs promising a blocksize hard fork". So, a lie again.
No, you just lied, it were 5 Core devs that signed:  and 0 Core Devs that were speaking against that. Plus the official bitcoincore site links to such roadmap.


No, you just lied again: Their node will run fine, thats correct, but they cant to anything with Segwit tx. Since bitcoin is all about tx, either their node/software/library will be useless without implementation or segwit will be useless if you cant use it. Pick one


No, you just lied again: all links say they are WIP. I said that keeping the blocksize artificially small because LN will be fine is a stupid idea when the blocks are full and fees going up. And as you just proved, I cant use LN atm in production and no service accepts it for now.


Dont be naive and accuse others of lying. They ofc get 180m$ funding to do... open source... without generating revenue ... from AXA! See here, they plan to charge on LN payment channels 
You can charge fees also in a decentralized network.


it isnt bullshit, its correct. I dont see a blocksize increase in bitcoin Core repo or any effort to do real on chain scaling for now ( Segwit doesnt help for now, see reason above )


it increases the effective THEORETIC CAPACITY, not anything else. dont lie to me. Thats the real bullshit being told here. A new users comes here and complains about slow tranactions / high fees, and get the typical reply: Segwit will fix it(it wont for at least 1 year from now) or use LN (ohhh wait, it isnt ready yet)


Depends on if you want to keep the bitcoin userbase small. Ofcourse there you can keep users from bitcoin away if the tx fee is too high and it will regulate itself like supply/demand. But that isnt my goal and wasnt satoshis too. There is no way that satoshi wanted to keep the limit low.


Yeah if you like slow transactions and high fees, youre welcome :)


Lie again. Classics Effort was 2 MB, and 8 MB wouldnt have broken Bitcoin too. And if blocksize is fine atm, why dont increase it if it isnt needed/wont be used? Long confirmation times and high fees are keeping users from bitcoin, I would call this breaking it.


im educated thanks, but you better stop being a troll by accusing others of wrongly of lying and such shit. That usually happens when you are out of arguments. So maybe read Satoshis white paper again and educate yourself.

@_date: 2016-11-07 22:05:49


Ive done that already, as I said you can choose between 
a) Rising Cost of a full Node which is not needed and will be very long time under 50 $ and assumed as fixed
or b) a infinite rising cost of transaction fees


It doesnt lead to mining centralization more than it is in current state. And for node centralization, its pretty much the same. There isnt any "not bitcoin-addicted" bitcoin user which runs a full node, so that wont change much with bigger blocks.
Smaller blocks will lead users to seek for btc alternatives as tx fee will make btc unuseable, which will keep btc userbase naturally small, which isnt exactly decentralization by all means. ( more users =&gt; more miner / full nodes )
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:33:12
wtf is wrong with you? Segwit isnt simple and clean, the review and development of it took months. If you want to see a simple and clean patch, take a look at the available HFs.
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:11:33


It isnt a lie, LN without Malleability Fixes is useless crap like Western Union.


Im not even against Segwit after all, I agree that it brings some nice things. But 
1. As Roger said, bitcoin needs a capacity increase ( segwit doesnt help as most people wont use Segwit, adoption is too low for now) and all Core does develop is things for LN which is far far away. Giving them Segwit now is like signaling that we are fine with that.
2. Software/Wallet Adoption is currently low, no need to hurry now
Not bullshit, but seems like an average post where you dont argue with facts and just falsely accusing of lying.


Same here, SegWit is no onchain scaling. Even if all people would use SegWit tx(which wont happen, I guess less than 5% will use it), it can only reduce tx size by a constant of like 2, so blocks would also be realistically also full since then 2,5% of low fee unconfirmed transactions would get confirmed. Increase capacity by a maximum of a constant isnt scaling.
As I said im not against Segwit, just do HF now(which is actually scaling) and Segwit later when adoption is higher, makes more sense imo
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:31:37
Dishonesty and hidden agendas? Its worse than CNN here
The arguments are pretty stupid, newly created Reddit/Twitter /Medium Accounts arent dishonesty and there are a lot of big Blocks supporters in There is also no hidden Agenda, the Agenda is clearly following Satoshis Vision of P2P cash.
Unlike Bitcoin Core Devs who promised Block Size increase HF not only years ago, but also in the HK agreement with the miners but they seem to forgot about that now. Thats hidden Agenda, btfo
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:18:49
Strange way to describe that it solves problem(s) necessary to solve for LN, you could ofc also solve them in a softfork called "Borgstream Power Play v1.0", but still makes sth like Segwit necessary for LN
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:36:03
You are aware of that LN doesnt exist for now ( actually it is years away!) and blocks are full?
Bonus round: LN critics arent just some things, 
nobody knows how / if it ever works and what will be possible.
Dont get me wrong, im not against innovation. But surrendering btc to technology which is the defintion of uncertainity isnt a good idea imo.. Especially when Satoshis scaling vision was totally different.
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:54:52


Nice way to agreeing to my position. You are basically saying sth like bitcoins still works without being decentralized, P2P, open and proof of work (that "database" is what IBM wants to sell :D ), it just doesnt have any advantage to MS SQL Server. So like LN without it its completely missing the point and doesnt make any sense.


Thats correct. I wrote it that way because I see here many times: "Help! blocks are full, tx confirmation take ages" and the answer is we need to activate Segwit. But even if segwit is activated, judging the current implementation status 95%+ wont use it, and it reduces tx space only with a constant of like 2, that isnt enough to clear the backlog of tx and doesnt make the blocks less full / tx less slow, but maybe a bit more inexpensive for some time. ( which also wont last long since blocks are full and you need to compete with fee)
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:11:13
You can, because it seems it wont be opt-in anymore in the future
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:33:25
Checked out:
*"Bitcoin Core 0.12 will be released around February 2016 and will include opt-in RBF, and after that it will likely take a couple additional months before the behavior is commonplace."*
I might agree that there might be very rare cases where RBF makes actually sense(most of them are not implemented and far from being useable yet, or is there any cool thing I could do with RBF already today?), but I dont really see the point why the most of the users/miners should use RBF.
In fact I dont find it reasonable at all if even your FAQ states that some transaction processors/old wallets might get scammed by RBF. Correct, there isnt 100% security with FSS w/ 0-conf, but I trust Mike saying that transaction spaced w/ 10 second gap have max 1% risk(and still decreasing with every additional second). Commonly used (opt-out-)RBF would increase this risk to 100%, right?
*Sidenote/can be ignored: While RBF is clearly breaking compatibility with old wallets, processors etc., some other changes(that make more sense imo) get rejected for breaking compatibility.*
Thats one of my problems with RBF, and I'd like to know why the average user/transaction processors/miners should use RBF commonly(or why it should ever be opt-out)?
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:12:28
There is still a problem because core devs want to kill the "opt-in" part about it in the future. At least it seems so:
@_date: 2016-02-05 16:01:40
**Warning** This release contains Replace by Fee, which isn't probably what you want to have.
Before Upgrading read this 
or TL;DR: it will introduce sky high fees and could render bitpay/coinbase useless.
*Edit:* devs had pointed out its actually opt in, but you can still show your opionion about it by not upgrading your node
@_date: 2016-05-21 14:06:59
Currently in bitcoin theres a hardlimit for blocksize ( block cant be larger than 1 MB, there are some opressed efforts to change that ). Miners can choose which transactions to include in their blocks and as mining is profit oriented, they will logically choose the ones with the highest transaction fees first. 
Now if the blocks are full which means there are more transactions than the blocks could include, there is effectively a fee market then.  Assuming that every transaction is needed ( which is either already the case now, or will be in near future, doesnt matter ), everyone will increase transaction fee to get their transaction confirmed. Unfortunately this will lead only to higher transaction fees, not more transactions in the blocks and not faster confirmations at the end. More people cant fit on a bus if you just charge each person more.
And this wouldnt happen if blocks arent full, miners could include all transactions including those without fees, therefore full blocks create fees, its correlated.
@_date: 2016-05-21 21:27:27
Pls read before posting
I said that fees are caused by full blocks and there's nothing wrong about it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:32:28
nope, a client might be able to relay blocks and stuff, but isnt able to receive new transactions
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:00:17
There are rational arguments for that:
First of all even if Segwit is a soft fork, it requires all client to implement it ( and theres very much to do compared to block size increase). As you can see here most clients havent even started to do that 
And because Core`s Roadmap plans a hardfork for blocksize increase too, nobody could really answer why not hardfork first ( no work for clients, fast and secure ) and then push segwit ( dont get me wrong, segwit is good, but it takes a lot of time) after all devs have updated their client. SegWit deploy is imo more than 9 months away, block size increase could be done in 2 months.

No, the risk of a double spend without RBF opt-in flag isnt realistically there after 5 seconds of tx propagation; with opt-in you can always double spend


Imo not a good idea to break something first and to hope it will get fixed another way by another feature in the future

Thats why I said "realistically", without RBF theres less than 0.1% chance you can double spend a tx if the first one is already propagated for like 20 seconds in the network.
