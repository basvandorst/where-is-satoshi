Hello 
I am Sophie from Belgium. I wanted to ask you for a donation to the OMF. 
The open medicine foundation is searching the cause of and a solution to CFS\ME. A chronical illness that is progressive but it is in many countries not accepted. It is a complex disease and many millions live went missing. There are patients who can work for half time, there are patients bedbound 24/24 and 7/7. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disorder characterized by extreme fatigue or tiredness that doesn’t go away with rest and can’t be explained by an underlying medical condition. CFS can also be referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID). Tiredness or fatigue 
 is just one symptom of many. The patients have more health problems. They have indeed a battery problem (tired all the time)  (never recover or very slow) and never start a day like they once did at 90-100% battery level. The imumesystem has problems, they get every year some infections. Like soar throat or inflamminations. Also from a little infection we dont recover like before. It takes a long time. (Like 3 weeks for a infection that healthy people recover at 1 week). They are many patients with CFS that have more diagnoses. Like ME, fibromyalgia, PDS,... There is currently no cure, so treatment for CFS focuses on relieving your symptoms.
I m sorry for my bad english, you can find more information at the OMF wesbite. 
and millions thanks!!
