I understand your arguments and the idea behind the trezor. But if enough people start storing serious amounts of bitcoin on trezor, don't you think it will become a target for attacks. It may not have wifi, internet, bluetooth but it is connected to a computer via USB whenever you need to spend. Also, the iPhone is designed to only run signed software but that hasn't stopped people from running unsigned software.
The problem I have is I don't see the trezor being significantly safer than an iOS wallet, maybe its marginally better, but thats not enough to make me feel comfortable storing more than a few bitcoins on it

The bit I am uncomfortable with is that you need to connect it to a computer directly to use it. My computer is so complex whose architecture was designed well before security became a major concern that I can never know all the software that is running and what it might be trying to do.

Whats to stop people from finding vulnerabilities with the trezor and "jailbreaking" the trezor?
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:26:28
I just want to say this is fantastic. The concept is exactly what I had in mind before I even discovered your wallet. Thanks. I have a couple of questions:
* Can we add some kind of address book. I like to send BTC to my wife occasionally and copying her BTC address from another app is cumbersome
* When the iOS device is backed up, does any of the private key information go into the backup, whether in iCloud or iTunes. i.e. do you use  kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly or similar for the keychain?
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:32:04
how is this worse than the trezor?
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:26:17
yes, dedicated device, less complex, less attack vectors, lower probability of attack, thanks
That was better than the hotdog explanation.
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:56:48
OK thanks, but I am not ignoring the attack vectors of the iPhone, I am trying to understand how the trezor is better. Apple has been trying forever to prevent jailbreaking and the running of unauthorised code on their devices and have so far failed. How is trezor better placed to prevent similar "jailbreaking" techniques?
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:37:59
One more question for the author, why don't you market this a bit better. I installed Hive today and was a bit "meh" about it. Then I was thinking how would I make their wallet better, then I came across your wallet and it almost exactly matched perfectly my idea of the perfect wallet. I think just having the wallet in the app store is understating how good this app is. Build a slick website, do an interview with Coindesk or other sites. The app has a lot of potential in my opinion
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:50:20
ok, so apple hardware from almost 5 years ago is vulnerable. That doesn't make todays devices easy to crack. Maybe in 5 years time people will post youtube videos showing how easy it is to crack today's trezor.
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:02:59
can hotdogs interact with software on your computer? Not a comparison that makes me feel any safer
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:57:33
please read up on iOS security before posting false statements.
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:18:04
I wouldn't feel comfortable with more than a few thousand dollars worth on anything but a paper wallet. The fact that you are constantly connecting your trezor to a computer via USB and that computer could potentially contain trezor specific malware.
For anything less than this amount, I feel totally comfortable (so far this thread has yet to convince me) with it contained on an iOS wallet plus its much more convenient and can be pin locked, remotely wiped if lost or stolen.
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:59:03
It mainly affects jailbroken devices or a rogue app has made it into the app store. 
Despite being a massive target, it practically doesn't exist if you have not jailbroken your device. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:50:22
thoughtful intelligent response, thanks
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:48:18
the iPhone is also designed to resist reading of the keychain by unauthorised parties. Are you saying its easier to crack the pin code on iOS than it is on the trezor? If you can show me something that proves this is and always will be the case, you are on your way to convincing me.
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:22:52
good point
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:38:10
agree, however I need to connect the trezor to my computer in order to use it, the attack surface of my PC is many times that of iOS. Its this problem which makes me feel uncomfortable storing a large value of bitcoin on it.
In my view it sits in an uncomfortable position, not secure enough to store large amounts of bitcoin and not convenient enough to use as your everyday wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:54:20
I would fully support a dedicated offline device which printed out paper wallets
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:51:04
thanks for your valuable input, yes I do use apple products but feel no need to convince the rest of the world to do so. This debate could apply to any platform similar to iOS, Windows phone for example, not just the ones made by apple. 
I use a very nice iOS wallet for smallish liquid amounts of bitcoin. I feel safer with my wallet on iOS over OSX and I use paper wallets for my larger bitcoin balances. I can't figure out if the trezor is for your everyday wallet or for your life savings or for both. I thought this debate might help me solve that problem.
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:10:04
This is a good point but I have multiple paper wallets each with a smallish balance. I plan on importing as needed these wallets into my everyday wallet. This means that I am only vulnerable once at the time of import for a relatively small amount.
I get nervous at the paper wallet generation phase, thats the bit that I wish was easier. I know of the piperwallet paper wallet printer but I don't trust thermal paper.

Isn't a 12 word seed simply another way of representing a 128bit seed with a checksum. What you are really testing here is whether 128bit seeds are strong enough. See this answer

Just so you know. I still use my 5 year old iphone and 3.5 year old iPad, despite my kids dropping them on the floor countless times. The longest I ever used a Nokia phone was 2 years. 
About your point. I live in a country where everyone works super long hours to buys heaps of junk that they end up throwing out. Wouldn't it be better if everyone worked less hours, spent more time with family, friends and the community and bought less crap. Just saying that consumerism sometimes doesn't lead to more jobs, just increased working hours and a poorer society
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:46:28
So you're essentially saying that the volatility forces consumers to become speculators
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:22:16
But maybe I have an old valid address from a previous transaction in the clipboard. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:51:42
It's people speculating on the future value of bitcoin bidding up the price. If bitcoin becomes mainstream, its price could be justifiably quite high. Its a high risk, high reward bet essentially on bitcoin's future. I believe at around $700 at the current point in time, the risk doesn't justify the potential reward, but thats just my opinion. 
Not necessarily a bubble, although I am sure some people bought in just because they thought the price would rise without really understanding the currency and its potential future
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:54:39
Thanks. Merchants have Bitpay etc to protect them from the volatility but there is still no good service that I am aware of to protect the consumer from the volatility.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:15:16
The problem for banks is that bitcoin is associated with lots of fraud. Criminals steal a user's online banking credentials then transfer funds  to an exchange or localbitcoins user where they can buy bitcoins and make off with the bitcoins. I was a victim of this type of fraud whilst selling on localbitcoins. I.e someone payed me with stolen funds. I had to spend several hours with the bank sorting it out. 
I personally believe that if the banks provided their own mechanism for converting fiat into bitcoin, they wouldn't have to deal with all this fraud. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:17:57
Your post really shows what a f* up world we live in. Governments are meant to represent the interests of the people right? If the masses want bitcoin, but the banking class don't, then who's side SHOULD the government take, and who's side will it take.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:36:06
After you withdraw cash from the ATM, they don't get to collect transaction fees on your subsequent cash transactions either.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:02:22
I still feel a bit of trepidation when moving bitcoins between my own wallets, double, triple checking, then hoping that I have copied and pasted the correct address.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:02:49
First of all, are you talking about debt induced deflationary spiral. Or a deflationary spiral caused by a naturally deflationary currency. I am not aware of any major instances of the second. 
Second, I think that maybe the inbuilt inflation in our FIAT currencies may be causing the hyper-consumerism that we are experiencing in the west which may be contributing to the rapid run down of the limited resources we have on our planet. Maybe a deflationary currency which is constantly appreciating in value may make people think twice before spending it on that piece of junk that you just throw out a few weeks later.
