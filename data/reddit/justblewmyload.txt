Since when have we reached "stability"?

This is great!

Very very well put. This is a well-spoken man. Kudos to him. I will be using this as a framework for pitching Bitcoin to people who are ignorant to the premise.

The test was fun. Thanks for that.

Well the Dow J is only 30 stocks...

Can you swag me out right quick
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:54:15

Sweet list!
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:13:39
Relax. I thought it was hella funny.

I used Shapeshift.io yesterday because of all this Cryptsy talk. It was painless and instant.

This is great news. Thanks for giving us the option and I'm enjoying your game so far!
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:42:06
You the best! Thanks!

You had me at bubble fart.

Just cracked a beer to this good news!

What a baller! Crazy how he had the confidence and foresight to do such a thing back then.

Every Visa needs a Mastercard and every Coke needs a Pepsi. I think it's only natural that there will be other players in the space, even if Bitcoin is by far number 1.

I've used BTC-E over 4 transactions. Nothing but good experiences with them. Just don't keep your Bitcoin there for longer than you need.

Yeah I've always been sick of MoonGuy.  His contributions to the community are intelligent and add to the discussion every time... I haven't seen him during this crash, seems like a fair weather fan to me.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:32:15
That's awesome.
