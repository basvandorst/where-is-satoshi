Nah this is a good example of why a lot find you all just insufurable. You can't accept the fact that people have all the same information &amp; knowledge as you and then conclude "wow this is really stupid"

@_date: 2014-05-25 18:16:32
You can be as efficient as the physics of the universe will allow but the fact is "mining" is just brute forcing against an algorithm designed to make brute forcing the solution harder the more transistors you throw at the problem. You all will never get ahead of the power creep, ever.

My name and address are on public record all over the place due to the fact that I am an adult that owns things so I don't get all bent out of shape having to tell people what they are. Even trying to make this an issue I need to worry about with using a credit card is pretty dumb.
Worse case someone gets all my CC  means oh man 30 minutes with the bank fixing that garbage.
Worse case someone gets my bitcoin keys and it's poof **gone**.

This is my hobby, pissing on dumb nerds.

Because exchanges have super great track records  between 1/2 of them shutting down randomly and having customer service issues that would make comcast cable blush.

A god damn bank lol
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:06:56
So the only way to take bitcoin is to tie it to a real currency so the end user/business is buffered from the insane speculating you all do? Yep that's a good sign.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:27:54
That doesn't answer my why jump through 2-4 extra steps to go to walmart and buy something. My cash/debt/credit/checks all work just fine without taking my chances at an exchange, which another one blew up yesterday in case you missed it.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:44:26
Doing redundant calculations to simply find some arbitrary # of 0s vs 1s in a computer is the very definition of wasting electricity. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:24:23


The people running the show say otherwise, tough.
Also once the IRS rips open the exchanges and bitpay and the like they're going to be able to tie everything you did real easily on the blockchain (because bitcoin isn't anonymous you see)
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:08:51

So bitcoins don't constitute funds so why are you all so bent on everyone else treating it as such?

@_date: 2014-05-31 16:50:40
That is one of the dumbest comments I've found today while finding choice shit to laugh at.
"This currency is great you just have to have the exact amounts of all your purchases in a 30-60minute time frame all calculated out ahead of time to get around the fact that confirmations take longer than 5s"
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:08:09
Yes Gox was the only exchange that had to suddenly shut down that week to fix a 3 year old issue. Oh wait [they weren't the only ones](
"The three biggest Bitcoin exchanges — BitStamp, Mt. Gox and BTC-e — all halted trading temporarily in the last few days. BitStamp and Mt. Gox account for more than half of all traded Bitcoins."
But lets keep acting like the protocol doesn't have a major flaw that existed for years because your developers are apparently morons for thinking it's a "minor issue" that crippled the system for days. Haha god you all hear what you want.

That all sounds nice until you remember that once people do steal from you in bitcoins it's gone for good and there is literally nothing you can do about it. At all. It's gone. All those exchanges getting hacked/taking off with the bitcoins, poof gone. So the solution is to ....make it worse. Ok.

Pretty sure that's impossible.

@_date: 2014-04-11 22:46:02
Mining is a mind boggling waste of electricity. Literal power plants of power being used to do busy work. This actually offends me.
Which leads to: Neat someone found a way to not require a server/center point to enforce actions. It's inefficient as hell (see point above) which negates its usefulness.
No chargebacks is a bad idea for anyone isn't a hardcore libertarian/anarchist/just plain ignorant. See: Any now defunct exchange, every scam pulled.
7 transactions per second limit, unless you change the block size. Which will just keep making the blockchain bigger faster. Except everyone gets around this by keeping a significant amount of movement on the exchanges. Which is funny cause it's a perfect example of why we centralize things in the first place, again negating the point.
Speaking of centralizing things: Mining pools. There was a nice panic here when some group was about to hit 51%. Again gee wonder why people are pooling their resources into a central authority? Oh because it works when someone's managing. Oops!
The entire Magic the Gathering Online Exchange episode was a giant step by step of "why people have a ton of rules about how you handle money/currency" but most bitcoiners completely ignored it because it conflicts with their worldview.
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:41:07
Ha yes the whole few dollars I've paid my credit union in.. lets see I can access a host of random ATMs for free (7-11 namely), bill pay is free, transferring to any checking account is free. Hell I'm not sure the last time I paid anything to them directly I'd honestly have to go look. Oh I know it must have been the like $100 bucks in random interest I got on the meager amount of money in my accounts last year. Yeah they sure bent me over.
Meanwhile $5000 didn't get ripped off from my account. Yeah I sure am a sucker in this equation.

Bitcoin systems *never* have to be updated or have maintenance on them.
Literally a week after a major issue came up that several exchange/services/wallet clients that required a ton of effort to fix lol.

* Smug posts about how much better they are than religious people
* One or two posts from teenagers in hyper religious homes looking for advise.

@_date: 2014-03-27 20:26:31
I just think this idea is stupid cause I actually have some understanding of energy usage, computers, networking, and the like. The economic side of the dumbness is just the icing on the wasteful cake.
Also nice us vs them raa raa going on here.
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:08:02
More like you don't understand how any of this works. All you know is BLOCKCHAIN = GOOD! and keep running with it.
Also  they're already doing this. Except in a sane centralized way because centralizing things is generally a better idea on computers. But when you're a bitcoiner such as yourself you think everything is a nail to be hammered down.
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:52:17
That's because that is literally the thing everyone is doing making these charts: wishful thinking without a shred of facts to back any of it up

@_date: 2014-02-13 23:22:04
Computers need a unique identifier because of a lot of programing reasons, not having one is a major design flaw. Ask any database person how much not having some unique field per entry would make them want to throw themselves off a bridge.

No bitcoin uses excessive busy work to fake a trust mechanism because you all have such a boner for decentralization that it's the only way you think this needs to work.
Central authorities exist in computer science for a reason. It's infinitely more efficient and easier to secure.
Edit: here's why mining is super stupid. You want to have a 1000 nodes verifying everything? peachy go for it. Everyone pull out their old NES from 1984 and let those mine. Those would just be as secure as all the existing mining equipment at a fraction of the cost.
The stupidly wasteful part is how much power you're throwing at an algorithm that's designed to prevent power creep.

Only in your ignorant imagination bucko. 
Btw the obvious retort to what I said is "but we need all those cycles to prevent a 51% attack on the network!" since that is a well documented weakness of the protocol. Which is why it's hella stupid vs a small collection of closed off machines. Also your argument falls flat when you factor in that the current banking mechanisms literally handle the world economy while you all had a panic when a single gambling site nearly flooded the blockchain. 
Always funny how little most of you understand your own garbage.

Why would I reinvent credit cards on top of bitcoin? That's kinda the problem here: there's a lot of "something!...but with bitcoin." I already have that thing why bother getting involved in this mess?
That gambling site nearly brought down the system 2 years ago and nothing has been done to address it. Yeah lots of confidence there :P You ramp up transaction speed at the cost of disk space &amp; having to transmit it all. Great they finally enable pruning, hopefully all the miners play along.
Edit: network propagation is going to become an issue if this system got really used. You spit your transaction at the closet node, the but node that finds the next block never see yours in time. Now you're waiting even longer to confirm it. I think this already happens. Again I don't want to be standing around, it's annoying waiting 3s for my card to confirm.

You realize that no one really paid linux any mind outside some niche applications until someone sizable took the core code base and applied it in a way they have control over and sold an actual product based on that.
IE if bitcoin ever "takes off" some how it's going to happen the same way.
Actually to be fair Linux actually did things better, bitcoin mostly has shown why societies have all these "damn laws" about money.

Automated services were properly built on the assumption the transaction ID is unique (cause that's kinda the point) but it isn't. System can't find the ID it's looking for, assumes something failed and send out the same bitcoins twice.
Basically the protocol did something wrong and some systems are built knowing that but if you didn't and built your software on what should be a slam dunk function then people could abuse that and rob you.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:16:11
Doesn't change the fact that small scale power generation is not cost effective or consistent at all so your idea is dumb.

I'd sit here and refute this tangential nonsense since a lot of it has less to do with how banking/currency works and more into social woes but you won't listen. You'll shift the goal posts like you always do and bend/blur/twist what the points around because BITCOIN MUST BE GOOD!
 This comment you bitched about in the bestof thread was so on the spot about bitcoin fees but you just stick your head in the dirt and go "what fees?". There's no way to get value through the bitcoin system without paying for it. The miners/mining itself (it isn't free), the exchanges, bitpay all takes their chunk out along the way. Yes I'm sure you'll dream up some perfect little situation that you can point at and go NO FEES SEE??? and sit there all smug, but I already know it will be some perfect little almost never happens setup. We'll go back and forth counter exampling because you just won't except that bitcoin has issues.

Lets see:
* the original programer/current devs completely miss that the transaction ID isn't unique as it should be.
* 2011 the bug is noticed, logged in a wiki somewhere, and partly ignored.
* Some days ago someone finally starts abusing this bug causing some automated systems (gox, other exchanges) to double send bits cause they can't find the ID in the latest transactions on the block chain
* Gox is the first time to come out and say oh shit we're getting smacked by this. Other exchanges follow suit. Oh and some wallet clients completely choke on the same bug.
* Devs I think finally go uh oh well uh just check multiple other fields to verify a transaction is right ( this is stupid btw)
* Bitcoiners shoot the messenger
To be far as long as Gox has been running someone should have checked the bug listing better and did the *workaround* as some others did. What is hilarious as all the pent up anger at Gox is just coming out at them when the real issue is the glorious bitcoin protocol having a flaw that caused issues all over the board. Not that you all want to acknowledge this because it would mean admitting this whole thing isn't ready for prime time and you're too emotionally deep to want to face that.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:21:08

I'm just going to repeat myself: Everyone was fine using Gox as the  go to price for bitcoins right up until they weren't 10% higher than everyone else (cause their withdraws were broken), but now that they aren't the golden child it's time to lock them in the basement and beat them with hammers. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:15:13


That's why this is pretty damn funny

They're made up and even people in the current "evil" financial sector know their "technical analysis" chart making is "if things keep going as is this will happen" guess work at best. For example there was plenty of "ok we've gone from 100 to 1000 on Gox in this time so in the same amount of time we'll be at 6000!" charts all over...and then Gox exploded.

It would come to a screeching halt because bitcoin can currently handle 7 transactions a second under optimal conditions. I don't know many transactions happen the world over in a given moment but I suspect it's a hell of a lot more than 7/s.
Also bitcoin is a giant waste of energy so.

Yeah those power numbers are making some bullshit assumptions to make bitcoin not look so bad, not  buying that for an instant. Yes power consumption gets into a big who's being the biggest wasteful jackass on the block pissing match. The bottom line is the bitcoin system could be run on an NES somewhere and be just as fast as it is with the piles of machines trying to run it now. It's supremely wasteful no matter how you try to deflect. Google on the other hand at least doesn't do 99.999% duplicate work with that power.
Mt Gox is still classic bitcoiner head in the sand nonsense. You all were just redoing what most the rest of the modern world already figured out, just everyone's too busy trying to be "disruptive" and "innovative" to even consider the lessons of the past. Again, bitcoiners have a worldview and they will stick to it above all else. I'm fine with this personally cause I get to laugh my ass off.
Hell your comparison dies right too: original bitcoin wallets kept the keys in plaintext in 2010/2011 whatever year it was. Way past when AOL figured out oops that was a dumb idea.
No chargebacks is bad for everyone. You have to be neck deep in some broken ideology to think otherwise. I trust bitcoiners on this point as much as you all go on about inflation killing your worth.

@_date: 2014-05-07 17:02:15
Every half brained idea I've seen in this sub to reuses the blockchain to do XYZ has been obviously thought up by some hair brained idea guy who has no freaken idea what the hell they're talking about. "lets do netflix...but with bitcoin!" "how about steam...but with bitcoin!" "how about house deeds...but with bitcoin!" "DRM..but with bitcoin" and on and on. All you all know is this magical protocol does a thing and you want to jam it into everything because you're borderline cultish around here.
As long as you all have to use coinbase &amp; bitpay to give merchants actual dollars you haven't solved the evil banking fees issue. If anything you made it worse: fees to transfer cash into bitcoins/have to invest in "mining" equipment, exchange fees, bitpay/coinbase fees, fees anytime you so much as *move any amount of bitcoin* (I do this for free at my credit union BTW). Guess what it costs a little to move money unless you want to slowboat a check from A - B. Apparently most of you use shitty banks that take advantage of your laziness.
I don't give a crap about using VISA's network or what they use it for. They have to maintain it and they built it so they can do whatever they want, including keeping me out of it. I thought that's what you free market types were all about? Besides I have access to another network called The Internet that gasp can be used for many many things :D
Also no one says you have to use VISA. If you don't wanna, don't. Checks &amp; cash are still valid payment types last time I checked.
Because getting you all riled up and hitting you over the head with your own delusions is funny

I have a dissenting opinion therefor I must be ignorant?
Not the fact that the only "business" taking these are selling drugs, child porn, and burritos has nothing to do with it.
Not the fact that due to rising mining complexity there's going to be an issue where electrical costs are going to outpace BTC value has nothing to do with it.
Nothing to do with the amount of scheme, scams, and lying that's surrounded this whole experiment.
Oh I forgot about MyBitCoin exchange just up and disappearing after being "hacked".

@_date: 2011-11-23 00:57:09
It's usefulness is limited because a handful of places accept Bitcoins. Nearly everyone takes my credit card (Wikileaks is about the only exception.)
Doesn't really help the biggest vender is probably Silk Road followed by TOR based child pornography sites. I've never seen any other sizable Bitcoin-only venders, because there are a dozen easier payment methods before Bitcoin becomes viable.

How about Gox take some of that money they're making and upgrade their shit?

I'm sure the 3 customers they lost over this is offset by people like me remembering this wonderful bit of satire of internet funbux later.

Good news: Buying mining equipment is exceptionally stupid as none of is it going to come out on the positive side when this whole thing finally comes to an end. The difficulty is spiking too fast. So don't feel bad you're missing out on that!
@_date: 2013-07-23 16:50:27
Dude scammed the lot of you for that many internet funbux and only walked away with $150k? am I reading that right? Jeez even the best of you are bad at this!

Are exchange owners stupid or lairs is the big question it seems. Which begs the question how smart is the group here for putting any faith in these things when they have historically been failures.

I was laughing in 2011 when the first crash happened. Then I laughed again a few days ago when it really blew up. I plan on having another good laugh in 2015 when another cycle happens.

Hahaha oh boy an e-celebrity for Internet bux! How important! I should treat someone who got all up in arms over a parking space/$1.50 like a child with much more respect that I have.
Oh no I shouldn't, this was pathetic. ...bahahaha important bitcoin person ooooooh man. Phew. :wipes a tear away:

Everytime Gox lags everyone goes "omg those HACKERS" when the reality is Gox has a shitty system that can't do more than 7 transactions/s and someone(s) just did a major cash out that's hitting a ton of orders.
Gox sucks and got you all to buy into this hacker excuse.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:15:39
I know right, that lameass fiat bank account of mine hasn't changed value at all in the last week, vs bitcoins wild fluctuations from 130 to 70 to 120 to 100 to 55 to 95...man I wish my savings did that! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:24:05
You mean you shouldn't listen to a insular group that circle jerks and is only interested in the price going up so their "worth" continues to climb? noooooo

50% drop in price in 24H is a crash, hope that helps.

I would love, LOVE, to hear someone try to talk my mother off why she should use bitcoins instead of her Amazon Prime account (or whatever it's called) for her idle shopping habits.

It's funny trying to draw this comparison when gold is considered the go to for looney toons who think the world is going to end tomorrow. Soooo what are you trying to say is a positive here for gold or bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:16:20
How well have the various bitcoin charities done with this "1 billion dollar" (not really) economy? You should look into that.
Terrible. The answer is terrible btw.

There's a reason most companies don't let you account share with someone else's information, but let's keep acting like this is anything but the fault of you &amp; the guy who ...I don't want to say tricked because you walked right into this. Keep banging that bitcoin drum!

So did Beanie Babies, TF2 hats, and Wow Gold. Whoopity do. Difference being they all do something (TF2 hats do anything or just for show?) besides try to be replacements for something that doesn't need to be replaced. Hell more people care about WoW Gold than bitcoins. Fake MMO money has more value to more people than your super currency of the future. I wouldn't be surprised if you all barely hit parity with EVE ISK. 


haha ok sure buddy
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:03:35
I'm LOLing at the comments as everyone was all WOO $100, $150, $200 etc etc while the price was going up but now it's "pff who cares".
