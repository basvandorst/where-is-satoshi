Ideally the best outcome would be to take over their own ATM's and beat them at their own game.  But the word partnership sounds very nice too. 
Edit: word not world.

you're right, it's pitbull terrier, but I think it's time to drop the "pit" and rename them to american bull terrier.  This one will not be fighting in any pits! :-)

I had a similar incident where I wanted to return something that was purchased through purse, so I went throught the amazon return gift process but the merchant refunded the original buyer instead of me and did not care about my problem at all.  I tried contacting purse about it and it's been 3 days with no reply.  So now I'm out of my product and money.
