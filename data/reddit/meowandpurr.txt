Well seeing that Bitcoin crashed less than Facebook who was considered the gold standard, I'd say Bitcoin is strong.  People only look at short term like the article says and will learn from their FOMO decision soon enough :D

Sorry guys, but here’s the thing, Facebook started the tech stock sell off which should have seen an impact on Bitcoin which is also in the tech sector, however it did the opposite. I just thought that was interesting but yeah site is crappy, just interesting opinion.

Couldn’t agree more with you. ��

True, and thanks for the clarification. I think Monday was the larger drop for some tech stocks I guess and on Monday the Bitcoin price went up nicely.  Let’s hope it keeps going.  I’d love to see Bitcoin performing better than the stock market if only people wouldn’t keep fear-selling... worried the pump and dump from large whales could cause continued volitility.

Interesting how the tech market crashes while Bitcoin goes up over 20% lol.  Bitcoin can HOLD it's own!
