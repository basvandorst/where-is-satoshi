Hey, there's a big difference between us 2016 and newer Civic drivers. We actually care about our cars. Don't even get me started on the late 80s-early 90s model Civic drivers.

Easy there Roger Ver.

I agree with you. Do you think atomic swaps will help break that unhealthy habit?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:14:46
Tax write-offs ya know.

Do people like you just want absolutely no communication, virtual or otherwise, with anyone anymore?

Best guests he's had...Jordan Peterson, Graham Hancock, Trevos Valle, Neil Degrasse Tyson...Andreas.
Edit: Oh, and Dan Carlin!

Yeah, they just said it so many times over the course of a decade (1998-2008) that it happened within their window. Broken clocks are still right twice a day.

I think more importantly, who is this Japanese guy on her news taking credit for Bitcoin? Did Satoshi step out of the shadows?
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:27:03
You're assuming you're responding to a person that didn't use 100% of their available credit to buy BTC at the ATH.

Dude, I'm 29, have myself rewound cassettes with a pencil, and even I'm looking at your first job as an archaic venture :)

Oh boohoo. Can't handle a small market correction after 3 straight days of soaring. By the way, it's going to go down more. Newb.

Yes, many memes suggest hookers are making money from this rush as well.

So where am I at during all this as someone who bought in at $480?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:28:05
.22 bought at $50 back in 2015.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:32:08
And Bitcoin Litecoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:23:42
You got a bargain education.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:15:42
I think you're right, and that's after it corrects back from the all-time high.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:07:39
Kinda low-balling it aren't they?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:57:23
He's an interesting guest. That's all my point is. Notice I have Neil Tyson and Valle, a paleontologist, on there too.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:10:14
You are really dedicated to this creative username of yours.
