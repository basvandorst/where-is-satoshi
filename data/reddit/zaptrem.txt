A blockchain* there is more than one.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:25:59
So what is the point? Hypothetically, if I for some reason hated the idea of an alternative currency but was fascinated by the possibility of decentralized apps, why would blockchain still = bitcoin?

Does segwit -&gt; non SegWit get a bonus?

Eventually it is in their best financial interest to fix the situation. If they have other priorities than SegWit in the short term, decreasing the fees likely won’t take them long.

Can you explain what you mean by this?

I wrote this guide mainly as a way to help others out following the same path I did. After running into so many Windows-specific compatibility problems I was ready to throw my computer out the window! Hopefully this should save fellow Redditors some time and sanity, so they can get to the fun part (creating and breaking things!)  :)

I'm imagining your average smartphone user who has no idea when they will open the app next. Unless the channel is closed, I wouldn't publish my payments from him, so if I disappear and he closes it when I'm not paying attention he could only publish the state up to right before he sent money to me so he could steal, right?

TCP/IP is very general and can be used for much more than value transfer. It seems like Bitcoin would better fit one of those other, more specialized protocols you mentioned.

I don't think Lightning supports pruning right now, though it is in progress.

I see. I would have done that too if it weren't for my VPS provider assuming a Bitcoin node and Bitcoin miner were the same thing (I tried to convince them otherwise but just kept getting "TOS says no mining")
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:05:55
If your home net connection is awful, I suggest putting the lightning node in the droplet as well.

I wrote out this text guide on Medium and posted it to Reddit earlier, but it was overshadowed by the Tether news:

Can they still benefit from SegWit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:53:52
Duh. Totally forgot!

Thanks for these useful corrections. The original guide was mostly from memory and my own notes, so I missed a few sticking points. However, I'm pretty sure LND uses the same wallet password the guide instructs the user to encrypt using the encryptwallet command earlier (correct me if I'm wrong, I might have run the create command in LND as well and just created two separate wallets with the same password).

I think my guide is the best we’ve got

Won't the funds be recovered if the counterparty closes the channel?

If BTC should be seen as digital gold instead of cash, why would LN cause an increase in value?

Do they still update QuickTime for Windows?

You're missing the bigger picture. Look up, at the people that see millions of dollars in each fraction of a percent change in the inflation and interest rates. Also, look at the baby boomers, who might be less willing to buy corporate bonds if they know their money will accumulate automatically. Finally, what makes you so sure Bitcoin will ever be stable? Despite the parallels people like to make to modern currencies ("neither is backed by anything!"), Bitcoin will never have the minute-by-minute fine-tuned control the US Dollar does.

More value is added by a transference mechanism to something that is designed to be frequently transferred than something that is frequently ~~hodled~~ hoarded (gold)

I'm not arguing with the potential of blockchain technology. My previous post was mostly came from my concern for a future capitalist economy that is run on a deflationary currency. Right now, we depend heavily on the Federal Reserve to keep the US Dollar inflating steadily so people are incentivized to both spend and invest. Right now, our capitalist economy depends on money being "multiplied" by being lent from person to person and bank to bank. If people hoarded their money instead of spending it because they thought it would get more valuable in the future our economy would simply collapse.

Coinbase certainly can be trusted. They're operating in the US and following every regulation for existing as an exchange and store of value and so on. They also have a significant amount of VC capital behind them, so even if they ARE hacked your BTC should be safe.

Yes, and Satoshi Nakamoto has quite the fortune in Bitcoin stocked up. All of the cryptocurrencies are like this because people are greedy by nature.
