You're forgetting about arbitrage. As long as people felt they could withdraw fiat from mt gox, they would buy/sell to bring other exchanges into line with the mt gox price. So during this phase you could consider all the exchanges to be part of Gox, in a way.

For a while the situation was that USD customers had trouble, but Europeans had it easier, and Japanese even easier to withdraw. So there were enough 'leaks' to enable arb. Also, my guess is that Karples, having a surfeit of goxbux on his system with not enough real $ to back them, blocked the big accounts from withdrawing, but allowed small fry to get through.

It's all very well being captain hindsight and saying "ha ha the value of bitcoins has gone up since then", but the fact is that at the time they were worth fuck all. So it's really no different than if he had spent &lt;insert equivalent in USD at the time&gt; on pizza. Or to put it another way, you might as well laugh at some guy who spent 10 dollars on a pizza and say "you should have invested it in bitcoin instead".

Hold your horses, your dollars are not profit until you sell them for food. If the dollar crashes (excuse me, I mean WHEN the dollar crashes), your profit will be zero.

What kind of a self loathing masochist do you have to be to want to pay taxes on bitcoin? I mean, hasn't the government stolen enough from you already? Bitcoin is the one opportunity you have to hide your property from the mafia. Don't throw it away, people.

Yes, because it would totally be in their interests to not recommend gold when they were invested themselves, cos there's NO WAY that doing so would drive up the price of gold.

This article is shortsighted IMO. 
What I see happening is: Cryptocurrencies (whether BC or something else) become more and more prevalent, and more and more trade happens outside of government's purview. Eventually the whole eCommerce supply chain is conducted in crypocurrency, and no tax is paid (stores that choose to pay tax are soon driven out of business by those that don't) 
This forces governments to make ends meet by placing larger and larger taxes on everything they CAN control - basically everything conducted in fiat currency - breathing tax, council tax, you name it -  Which of course will drive more people into using crypto. The more they try to squeeze, the more incentive people have to escape, the less money they have to pay for police and jails.... you get the idea. 
It's the beginning of the end for these bloodthirsty fucks, now excuse me while I celebrate with some champagne.

People in those organizations may well adopt bitcoin from the bottom up, but orders come from the top down. And the people giving the orders don't need any safe havens - they can print money at will. Their safe haven is maintaining the status quo. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:51:25
actually it's totally in their interests. If you own a big fraction of all bitcoins then by spending them you would be effectively inflating the money supply, increasing the price of all goods and services in bitcoin. Thus you would be poorer. If you hoard instead, you are richer.  It's like the debeers diamond cartel. Choke the supply and keep the price high.

Why not use bitstamp? 0.4% commission. They don't have a UK account but a one off international transfer fee is better than paying 5%

This is a great idea. Dupe the gubmint into believing that bitcoin is a source of revenue for them, and keep them fooled until they realise too late that they're finished.

Is this meant to be some kind of obscure double irony, or are you really dumb enough to think that?
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:10:01
if bitcoin goes up because some other currency has inflated, then bitcoin users are essentially unaffected, as we are no richer than before

Yeah, it's like "No shit, sherlock".  The value of bitcoin relative to fiat depends on the value of fiat! Who knew!

Well, if you break up a transaction into many small transactions, all going to the same address then you will even it out.

What does that say about the government? That they care more about wars and drone strikes than helping their own elderly citizens should worry you. Do you really want to fund such an evil institution?  Are you really going to say "hey you should pay taxes cos otherwise the government wont have money for the elderly, they need their drone strikes ya know"? Come on.
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:06:57
Ah, didn't know that. I had assumed each small transaction was an independent dice roll, thanks for setting me straight.

Incorrect. You are engaging in reductio ad absurdum.  All they have to do is not spend their coins ALL AT ONCE.  They have to spend them slowly. And by slowly, I mean they could still afford to live like emperors.  
If you have, say, 1 million bitcoins then by putting up one big sell order on mt gox, you would be shooting yourself in the foot. On the other hand, if you put up 100 sell orders, each spaced 1 week apart, then you would be better off, as the demand over that period will more closely match the supply. Spread it over 10000 sell orders over 5 years, and you're even better.  
Therefore it IS in their interests to limit the spending of their own bitcoins, but that does NOT mean that they have to go to the absurd extreme and spend nothing at all. It's a trade off.
@_date: 2013-03-10 01:41:10
That's your choice of course, but it sounds borderline paranoid to me. How are they going to find out? If you say you spent them, how can they prove you didn't? So they lookup a transaction on the blockchain, you simply say "Yeah I bought a used laptop from this guy. He wanted to be paid in bitcoins".

There are 3 possibilities. 1. your grandfather ends up getting as much value out of medicare as he paid for in taxes over the course of his life (as compared with private insurance prices).
2. he gets more value  3. he gets less.
Which of these 3 would make it a good idea to have medicare rather than private insurance?  
If 1, it's no different. If 2, he's getting more than his fair share, aka stealing from other people. If 3, then medicare is worse than private insurance.

If I was Nakamoto I would have written my real name down, encrypted it with a strong hashing function, then put the hash in as a comment in the original source code, like this:
    The real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is below:
    rfh984afq3lhf3i7htqcm8odgp984t4tu384tcmlsdukht4
That way, if I ever decide that it's safe and desirable to reveal my identity in the future, I can reveal key to the public, thus revealing my identity and proving that I'm telling the truth.
I'm quite surprised he didn't do that.

Not true. If the price drops by 20% and you then buy, then you will have 25% more bitcoins in your wallet than you would have had by buying before the price drop. That means 25% more money for you in the long term.  
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:25:16
Bitcoin is also a threat in terms of taxes. BC makes it much easier to avoid tax-theft, and when that catches on, all governments will suffer.
