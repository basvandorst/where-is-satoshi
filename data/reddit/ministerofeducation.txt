I love the way you phrased it: "or else we might get replaced by some shitty centralized coin."
What do you mean? There's plenty of decentralized coins who already do what BTC does, in fact, they do it 10x better.
I know you need more investors to protect your bags, but camon lmao
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:42:58
You are very annoyed by a simple statement. I'm the one wondering, are you like this in person? Relax son. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:40:42
Yet only 9k active users.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:04:50
ayy lmao. I've read most of your comments and I found you hilarious. Do you have any comedic channel on youtube or something I can follow?
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:23:12
Really? I thought the whole world woke up at the same time. So, when USA wakes up we expect 400k active users right?
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:10:00
hahaha, when will you guys realize you're being conned every fucking day by whales. Jesus christ, please people, wake the fuck up.

@_date: 2017-12-02 22:28:19
lmao, at least you have a sense of humor about it I guess, hopefully you've invested and made some of it back, gl
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:14:49
You wrote ponzi scheme wrong mate
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:21:06
18 thumbs up? Clearly these plebs didn't know how to use Tor
EDIT: At least that's what a friend told me, k3k.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:43:38
You're a special kind of idiot:
You follow mr scam Charlie Lee, use coinbase, support BTC and make fun of Bitcoin cash.
You're doing it very wrong. My friend, education is key. Stay in school kids.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:53:28
lmao, dat guy swimming in btc moni
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:43:01
I uttered the exact same words.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:13:09
What is a ponzi scheme? I can't wait for this shit to blow over in 5 years. It will be hilarious. All it takes is this:
Markets collapse or you enter a severe recession. People trying to get their BTC back into FIAT to live: Nope. We ain't got that kind of money - every exchange.

What you need is some Jordan Peterson in your life, you never had your shit together, money didn't contribute or destroyed anything.
I love having more money after never having it, I can buy stuff for my niece, I can travel more with my close friends, I can make dinners at my house for my friends, etc etc. How would this be bad? Trust? lol wat.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:29:14
No one said otherwise. All trash alts.
There's only two alts who will survive this nonsense. XRP and IOTA, convert now or enjoy bankruptcy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:41:11
Bitcoin boys eat this guy's shit like it's gold.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:11:09
You're one of those guys who never read the whitepaper have you?
No, it's not doing what it was designed to do, it was supposed to be a p2p currency. **It is not.**
315K transactions for whales with an almost equal amount non-processed because the little man can't really move BTC besides trading for coins. BTC is just about some whales waiting for more bag holders that pour their hard earned money into a shitscam. Wake up and smell the napalm boy.
PS: No, LN is not gonna save this coin, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:18
Try &lt;500 USD, by the way OP talks, he's probably from a country like Ukraine, somewhere CIS.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:23:41
As a software engineer, you guys are just funny to me.
I said it once and I'll say it again: XRP(Assuming they can bite at swift) and IOTA
Good luck with your investments boyz.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:37:07
Until it doesn't.
That's how a ponzi works. It has a limit.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:35:47
Sorry downvote boys, I forgot it was a "store of value" lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:36:53
Why are you donating to charities? Do you know how corrupt most charities are?
Only a kid without real world knowledge would have such a novel dumb idea. But it's ok, you don't want to go to the bank? I'm sure the charities CEO's will have a riot with your donations.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:40:56
Who cares brother, it has become a ponzi scheme lmao, just go to your neighbor door and ask if he wants to be saved by our lord bitcoinjesus
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:07:15
That's obvious, millennials are mostly retards with no real world skill.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:35:56
Yes, BTC going for 100k amiright? lels
You boys better prepare for 2018 crazy market ride.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:24:18
Lmao. How does this not sound like a cult?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:58:06
Doesn't look like a pyramid
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:46:15
If people got to know what Bitcoin (network/technology) is, they wouldn't be here for anything else than money making till it breaks.
Which is fine tbh, I like money too. Just don't ask people to get to know the network/technology, that might deter people from joining the cult.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:04:27
You're a smart fella.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:21:48
but BTC technology is so good, you guys will be ok!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:25
This is why you should read whitepapers and be somewhat knowledgeable about the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:48:10
Yay then BTC will do what any other alt shitcoin does! Fantastic
