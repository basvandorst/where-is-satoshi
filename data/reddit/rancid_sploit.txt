The BTC ship has sailed for Greece. It's the rest of Europe that should be buying some, seeing how easily and quickly capital controls are implemented in a EU and EURO member state.

Now, all we have to do is scaling the bitcoin network to be able to handle all these transactions. In order for this to become a valid use/business-case.
@_date: 2016-03-09 10:48:37
Yet, you are not relaying transactions. So, no! Not a full node.

That early vision did have a more progressive view on the matter than what you are describing here. And the rarity lies in the amount of bitcoins available. Not the the amount of transactions/blocksize.

True, but then i think we get an unworkable situation. In which to much money could potentially get lost for the invested businesses and individuals. I have no clue where we would go from there, so the 'no split' scenario seems more plausible to me...
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:59:35
First big block can only be mined from Januari 2016. All they can do now is produce new blocks with XT and increment the block version.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:16:55
There is no split. The block chain forks and the longest chain, the one with the most PoW simply wins. If you continue to work on the lesser chain, you will be working with coins nobody is accepting, hence worthless. In that situation, I think you'll quickly shift to the new chain.
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:26:29
Blocks mined with XT will have a newer block version indeed.

He exports his keys to wallet software on his pc which are not dependent on a central server.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:48:08
It absolutely makes sense. But the word fast is not in its place in this discussion. A lot of proposals have been made in relation to growing the block size. Some have been implemented in code and have been extensively tested.
The testing has been done. We figured out the advantages and disadvantages. I'm pretty confident that kicking the can, with growing to 2mb, will not have disatrous effects.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:00:36
We'll see soon enough. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:47:13
The status quo does NOT equal consensus. The act unfolding in front of you right now is consensus. That 'mob' can release whatever code they want, if the economic majority does not follow, then that potential fork is dead. If the economic majority does follow and the protocol forks, that means consensus is found and we reach a new status quo. And the process can start all over again.
There is no central authority that should decide what features we do or do not implement in bitcoin. Only the economic majority can do that. Core is trying to be that authority and more, and that will be its downfall.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:06:42
None. Initial release of classic will be 0.11.2 + 2mb blocks. That is it.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:27:48
I don't think you understand what you are saying here...
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:11:23
No it is not. 75% is already super conservative. All you need is 51%, or 33% blah blah selfish mining and assuming no one else is doing selfish mining.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:57:43
That is not how this works. Certainly considering block rewards keep on halving. Better start innovating before subsidies go away.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:55:11
6 Billion is ridiculously small in comparison to this projects ambitions. Growing block size means more fees, which in turn means faster ROI (Return On Investment).
I think the conclusion that an increase in block size to 2mb is conservative enough for these guys, and that the increase of possible fees and usability of the network make a valid business case for those who invested the most (miners and startups).

This so very much. The bitcoin project is based on many highly specialized and technical fields of expertise that no single individual can grasp them all at a deep technical level. On a general high-level, sure.
Developers need to add new features, fix bug and listen to community. Let the market decide which features make it and which don't.

A political coup, lol. There shouldn't be a group of devs that have the "reins of the Bitcoin project" to begin with...
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:53:36
What you are seeing now are other development teams taking matters into their own hands and start producing their own implementations. The economic majority will decide what version of the protocol we will run and what the blockchain will look like.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:19:31
Hell no, the more competition the better. We need more different development teams. We need several reference implementations and then some. The economic majority will decide. If that doesn't work, then bitcoin does not work. Decentralize all the things!
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:34:46
So, everybody starts building datacenters in northern europe, resulting in electricity prices and industrial real estate prices rising... And incentivising other countries/locations to figure out how to produce cheap energy, if anyone cares and if there is anything to gain from doing that. Sure, some locations will come out on top. That seems only logical to me, but that doesn't make other locations useless in terms of mining bitcoin for profit.
The market remains at play.
And I also seriously doubt GMO are the only ones looking into and investing in improving bitcoin mining efficiency.

It would soon become way to expensive to carry out significant attacks. Just the sheer amount of transactions needed to bog down the network.
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:10:40
These days you can get about 1.5PB (yes, peta) in 12U rack space. I think we good...
Edit: And those are just legacy spinning disks. Go with flash and get 1.6PB in 4U. Granted those systems do rely a bit on data reduction (compression and deduplication).
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:03:45
You are not taking into account all the factors that aid in decentralization. Location plays a huge roll in this. The availability of enough electricity and its price, cheap cooling, space, etc. You can only grow as big as the limits of those factors allow. Ofcourse more efficient hardware also plays a role, but to get your hands on that hardware, you will have to pay a premium (buying or developing). As long as you can raise your profit % for every dollar invested you are good. But at a certain point this stops and you can not grow further without eating into your profits. Resulting in many miners co-existing/surviving in competition.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:15:53
That is the cost right now, when the network is not under attack. Raising the fees only a little bit at time of attack would drastically change that.
Edit: So would raising the blocksize:
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:31:06
BTW, you will never loose the bitcoins with a low or no fee.
The bitcoins will return to you wallet's balance when they are removed from the mempool (when they are not accepted into the blockchain for to long).
If you see your transaction not being accepted by miners for a few block, you could try to double spend it with a higher fee to speed up the process (you need to know what you are doing here ;).
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:28:16
I guess that explains it then. It is a confusing situation though.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:16:51
Not realy. Anyway, it all depends on how that network deals with such spam attacks. You can look [here]( for a detailed account of what has already happened.

@_date: 2015-09-21 16:22:16
That method is depricated and the torrent download is no longer maintained. Since the newest version of bitcoind syncing with the network is faster or equally fast as bootstrapping. You have to validate the whole blockchain anyway.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:38:07
Thats probably because of the signing key. I haven't been able to verify that yet. It should be easily circumvented by the un-brick procedure, which doesn't check signatures.

Yeah, check the compressed addresses and you'll find the coins.

          0x8a, 0x39, 0xed, 0x40,  0x7a, 0x84, 0xfe, 0x1b }
    };
From here: 
And this is an excerpt from my settings.txt:
    # Permitted public keys for signing firmware:

No way to predict that. It will take quite a while before we get to that level of transactions. I would imagine that by that time, decent broadband connections would not be a rarity anymore. Even then, just rent some cloud stuff to run your node. 
You can not just extrapolate transaction count and subsequent bandwidth needs, without accounting for future develoments in infrastructure.
Save up a few bitcoins now, and by the time we scale to the size you fear, they will pay for all the bandwidth and cpu time you could wish for...

They're not stupid. They have to keep the status quo. If they just go balls out bitcoin, they will be regulated and fucked over to oblivion, like the rest. Even a fortune 50 corp. like IBM.
Edit: Actually, if you've followed the IBM efforts in crypto the last few months, they know exactly what they are doing and how the whole bitcoin, blockchain, crypto world works. They are handling this pretty cleverly and if they succeed they will have managed to again be at the forefront of a new technology.
Check out their 'Smarter Planet' ideas and products. This ties in very nicely with their whole crypto effort.

Exactly what I was thinking. It doesn't sound bad at all. You'd have crypto fiat in you bank account. Send it to an exchane, 1 fed confirmation. Trade on exchange. Cash out bitcoins, one bitcoin confirmation. Sounds better than what we have now.
This could do wonders for the integration of bitcoin in the legacy system or vice versa.

**What does HD mean?**
HD is short for Hierarchical Deterministic. Typically, bitcoin wallets generate each new bitcoin address from a unique random number, requiring a separate backup of each new address. To avoid losses from lack of backups, such wallets use a single bitcoin address for all your transactions. HD wallets instead use a “master seed” (a single large random number), to derive all future bitcoin addresses sequentially from that single seed. This means that you only need to make a backup once, and all the keys generated by an HD wallet can be restored at any time in the future just from that single master seed. HD wallets greatly improve your privacy by being able to keep generating new addresses. If you use the same address continuously all your transactions will be associated with a single address, and because all bitcoin transactions are public anyone can see what addresses you are sending funds to, and calculate your total balance. With an HD account new addresses are created whenever you send and receive funds, making your transaction activity and total balance very hard to track.
**How do I make a backup?**
To create a backup, either tap the “Secure My Funds” button on the main page, or choose “backup” from the menu. You will be shown a list of words, one after the other. Write those words down with pen &amp; paper. You then have to type in the words again, to make sure you got everything right. Store this word list in a safe place! Anybody who obtains this list can access current and future funds in your wallet! Note: The backup procedure only backs up your HD accounts. Your classic single address accounts are not part of this backup procedure.
**How do I restore a backup?**
If your phone is lost or damaged you can make a fresh install of the mycelium wallet on a different device. Upon startup, choose “Restore Backup”. Choose 12 as the length of your word list, and let the “password” checkbox unchecked, and proceed to enter your word list. This recreates your master seed and automatically creates and synchronizes your first HD account. It might take some time until your first account is synchronized and the balance updates. If you had more than one account, navigate to the “Accounts” tab, tap the button with a key icon and plus on the upper right corner, and choose “Add HD Account” to re-create your second account, etc. Note: This procedure only restores your HD accounts. To restore your classic accounts you have to manually import each key/address by going to the Accounts tab, click the + button, select Advanced, and then Import. If your previous Mycelium installation had a Local Trader account you can recreate your trader account and data by clicking “Buy/Sell Bitcoins”, select the “My Info” tab, click “Create” and select the account that your local trader identity was associated with.

It's a bad idea. 
Your bitcoins are safe. As in, they are backed up. If your phone crashes, you can restore your wallet from the backed up seed.
Now this is all fine and dandy, but your bitcoins are not secure. Not even close. Your actual master private key and all private keys are on your smartphone. This is an internet connected device prone to hacking. These could be stolen and used to steal your bitcoins.
Keep your private keys offline and sign big transactions offline if you really want to keep your bitcoins safe. Look into multisig wallets, BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, Trezor (Hardware wallet), Electrum, etc.
