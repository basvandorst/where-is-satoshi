Bitcoin's infrastructure and ecosystem is still being built by entrepreneurs every day - remember this is a 'new' technology when you look at how old banks and the dollar are.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:42:19
There's a US exchange called [Coin Market](
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:36:08
On a series note, he and Jared mentioned that regulation and security will bring stability to the currency, and that cryptocurrency is the "inevitable future".
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:06:00
This sounds awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:53:27
Fair play, haha. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:07:26
API is being tested with a small group of ppl and will be released soon
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:14:47
All part of the process of the Bitcoin ecosystem maturing
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:43:52
Will the 'anonymity' hold up, or will the transparency of the blockchain and the scrutiny of the world win over? We shall see!
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:04:53
you've already been judged...

At CoinMKT, our fees are Maker-Taker.  We actually offer a rebate to the market maker of .25%.  That means, you have the chance to make money on the transaction itself.
As well, we have a banking partner and accept wire transfers.  
Edit: deleted a letter.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:40:14
They have good PR and they've been around a while. [CoinMKT]( adheres to all current AML / KYC requirements and any we'll follow any future regulations needed
@_date: 2013-05-11 23:53:30
Thanks for the questions:
1. Deposits and Withdrawals with cryptocurrency is pretty straightforward. For USD:
- Dwolla
- Bank Account (US Customers)
- eCheck/ACH
- Wire transfers
- PayPal (coming soon)
2. We will be accepting customers from outside of the USA, but we're primarily focused on enabling USD to enter the cryptocurrency market.
3. We can't really give away too much, but we use multiple master wallets and balance the load of coins in each based on trading.

No good for Gox
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:50:19
You shouldn't be, we've already filled trades with that pair. Please send support some screen shots or info to track it down.

Hey All, 
We're working on a few bugs we're experiencing with coin withdrawals &amp; ID verify. One note - if you have a middle name on your ID, include it in the First Name field, the scanning software processes your first name &amp; middle name as your first name.
We're working on a fix for this.
Please be patient, we'll get these kinks worked out! If you have issues you can email us at support
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:00:46
We ask for your information as part of KYC / Compliance. It is necessary from our end to know our customers to do our part to enforce AML laws in the US.
@_date: 2013-09-10 07:44:12
We're up guys, take a look:

When your mother starts asking you about Bitcoin, you know the currency is here to stay.

It used to take a bunch of guns and a large van to steal $10M, now you can do it with a laptop, crazy world we live in! 
@_date: 2013-09-08 05:12:24
Hey all, 
We're aware of a few bugs we're having, and we're working on fixing them over the weekend. If you have any issues please email support
@_date: 2013-10-02 03:26:02
Excited to be there, looking forward to it
@_date: 2013-09-11 07:52:50
I'm not sure I understand - this is exactly what we ask for:
Account Information - who are you?
Transaction Details - do you send &amp; receive money, are you real?
Balance - do you have a balance with which to deposit on our exchange?
Send Money - Deposit USD with us.
Receive Money - Initiate withdrawals from our exchange.
Funding Sources - Where does your money come from? AML / KYC requirements.
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:53:05
In their terms of service they explicitly say they do not do business with exchanges
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:21:10
You should start one!
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:31:40
yes we're working ACH as we speak
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:24:54
Yes currently our business model is 0.5% trades, 0.5% on withdrawals. As we are in beta, we're experimenting with all of these models and your feedback is welcome.
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:38:44
Interesting - never heard of this site but good article. They should have mentioned [CoinMKT!](
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:57:07
[CoinMKT]( will be operating similarly via wire or money order
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:43:40
You can use CoinMKT.
You can also buy 6 other cryptocurrencies through us as well. We support Dwolla, money order, or wire for USD. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:49:15
Guys - if there is a middle name on your drivers license, you must include it. The software scans the middle name as part of the first name. Please email support if you have issues.
@_date: 2013-10-02 05:43:35
They should be, the govt. shutdown and inability to control spending / debt are great examples of how Bitcoin can step in and be a stable, reliable currency for the people by the people
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:20:07
Or if it becomes so illiquid that it's not useful. The same property that drives the price up makes people hold onto it, and if no one spends it or uses it, what's it really 'worth'?
@_date: 2013-09-11 11:07:45
Hey all, you can find a lot of answers to your questions on the site, we're live now:
@_date: 2013-09-17 18:01:18
Glad to hear it!
@_date: 2013-09-10 06:13:20
We're working on an ACH provider to help out with that, will keep you guys updated.
@_date: 2013-09-09 22:20:24
Thanks for the great feedback.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:58:36
You can use Egopay &amp; OKPay, or a Money Order. We're working on getting ACH &amp; Wire back soon
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:22:29
Add [Coin Market]( , based in Santa Monica, CA, launching soon, focused on USD &amp; all crypto
@_date: 2013-05-13 00:40:00
That's a good point, we have reached out to them, they have one set of rules for 'virtual currencies', and another set for 'currency exchanges', we're unsure of the status of whether we will be able to support them going forward. 
That being said, as long as you have a US Bank account, you should be good to go for depositing USD.
@_date: 2013-09-17 06:31:26
Let me know, I come down there fairly often. I'm a UT alum, and I have a new BTC &amp; other cryptocurrency exchange
If anything becomes a regular event please post it!
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:56:28
I'm not sure, they were definitely filming the panels but I haven't found any links or heard anything yet, when I do I will post here
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:12:02
That issue has been fixed
@_date: 2013-05-11 23:36:40
We accept several methods of payment, we'd love to chat more! email us at support
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:43:10
cash + stock options
@_date: 2013-10-02 05:44:37
Another exchange in the US that's easy USD in and out:
@_date: 2013-05-23 00:23:31
Yes AML is the big issue and certainly needs to be addressed. 
Though I did hear a very interesting point at the conference as well: "Before Bitcoin, there was terrorism and criminal activity...and it was usually funded by the US dollar"
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:49:58
As of now we have been approved by Dwolla's compliance team or we would not be doing business with Dwolla.
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:02:47
I think there's quite a few gains left to go, good article though
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:35:36
Feedback welcome, drop your email in the box to be notified, beta coming soon!
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:17:32
No - your coins have shown
@_date: 2013-09-08 05:18:43
If you're having issues getting in please email support, we'll get you in.
@_date: 2013-05-11 23:59:39
We're definitely focused on the funding issue, our main goal is enabling USD to enter the market, so we're with you :)
That being said, it's not just that they're hard to fund, it's partly that they're hard to fund where the coins actually are. If all of the sellers of BTC or LTC were on an exchange that had easy deposit &amp; withdrawal of USD, that'd be great. 
You run into problems when you receive an order from the US but have to utilize an API to place an order on a foreign exchange. As we work on building the market here, we think that problem will decrease over time. 
@_date: 2013-09-08 16:05:46
Interesting catch, we're definitely an exchange - I'll have our legal counsel take a look at that and get back to us.
@_date: 2013-09-08 08:57:57
It's not over yet, we're working with them - so very good.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:01:06
We experienced some hacking attempts in the last 48 hours so we disabled withdrawals to be safe. Thieves are assholes, I know.
We're working on getting everything sorted out again, and I've seen your thread. I apologize for the inconvenience, we're on top of it.
@_date: 2013-09-11 11:05:37
Bugs with ID &amp; withdrawals fixed.
@_date: 2013-09-08 05:22:55
Hey guys - we'll get the bugs worked out, we're working hard.
We wanted to get out there and get started as opposed to building in our own little private box for forever, we hope you'll stick with us through this beta as we work out the kinks.
Any issues you find please send our way and we'll work on them asap - support
