Then also try Ólafur Arnoldson ;)
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:05:20
That's the thing, right? You try something out because the concept interests you, and then, somewhere down the road, it pays off. That's when you get that 'AHA! SEE?! SEE?! I KNEW IT!' feeling.

Thanks for the advice, will look into it.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:39:00
Actually, I did. Didn't expect that... Yay Reddit!
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:02:04
It is on iTunes as well. But this was a nice opportunity for me to try Bitcoin, and spread the word about some cool new technology.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:59:06
Awesome stuff! I recently started accepting bitcoin for my music as well. Not a lot is happening yet, but we just have to all jump in to make this grow bigger and bigger.
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:02:53
I'm regarding this as euphoric pump. HOORAY! :D
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:05:45
I need a captain here...
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:05:21
Currently looking into the sue-ability of the thing.
More will follow when I know more.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:16:56
Oh and, the bitcoin album has 2 additional tracks. Got yer incentive right there! :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:25:54
Hey that's awesome! Hope you enjoy it.
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:22:56
So... 1.2 billion potential new users.
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:39:41
Hey that's cool, I didn't know about Rdio.
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:00:35
I'm using bit/tracks to sell my album btw, they have a very nice layout and easy to understand mechanism.
Check it out:

If you're on the hunt for music anyway, try Erik Satie (if you don't know him already ;))
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:24:38
Well, in my honest opinion, music is already pretty darn cheap these days. But then again, if someone finds it too expensive, they are free to refrain from buying it.

Time for me to sleep. 
Thanks for the great responses everybody! Will answer any other questions tomorrow, feel free to ask anything about my Music, the Bitcoin thingy, my love-hate relationship with Sweet Chili Sauce and of course, feel free to ask about FREEDOM! WHOOO! FREEDOM!
Ok. Time for bed. 
EDIT: regarding the freedom bit, I'm not from the USA... there's freedom in a lot of places :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:54:04
I know the feel.
Feel free to listen to the full album (minus 2 tracks).
Just hope that, if you really like the music, you'll consider a purchase. :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:04:08
It's recorded on a grand piano that I was fortunate enough to find and use. Glad you like it!
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:55:05
Still, the webside providing the service gets a cut.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:03:57
He's an inspiration to me. Check out Nils Frahm as well!
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:17:54
Hadn't thought about that. Though, I don't use Apple's logo and I use a different font. A box with a glare can be made by anybody. Any other thoughts on this?
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:01:11
Love Debussy. Don't know about Villa-Lobos, got a specific piece you recommend?
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:14:33
That is true, although iTunes sales are counted in the charts, and bitcoin sales are not. So both have their pro's and con's.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:06:05
At the moment, bit/tracks pays out a higher percentage.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:22:37
Ditto. It's been my falling-asleep music on and off for a long time now.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:40:01
Thank you for telling me, you just made my day :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:55:20
Happening on Bitstamp too from time to time. Would love to see an explanation or idea for its cause.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:40:53
Where iTunes refers to it's website/store, I simply refer to bit/tracks for my bitcoin sales:
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:50:35
Why is that?
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:17:33
I just made my piano album available to buy with bitcoin, so I'm still waiting to see what will happen. This site does a great job on making music available:
