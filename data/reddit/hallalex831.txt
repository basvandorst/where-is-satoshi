Paypal does not reverse friends and family transactions because they are supposed to be one way.
The only reason to send as friends and family for commercial transactions is to avoid the paypal fee, which violates the TOS.  The screenshot further proves that OP violated the TOS by doing so.  For lower value amounts, paypal never reverses friend and family because you cannot renege to friends and family.  
The only way to reverse this is if the funding for the payment was from a linked credit card, and chargeback filed directly with the cc company.

In crypto markets, short term is a few days and undoubtedly buying on popularized support levels is a good bet. 
Obviously calling the most optimal exit points is challenging so as long as you don't get too greedy and are willing to settle for exceptional holding period returns, I.e. 20% over 3 days, is a great win.
Of course hindsight is 20/20 but running the historical analysis on such a strategy shows great gains. 
Since the fall of Mt gox, the optimal short term traders strategy is to buy off the bounce and lock in 20% profit.  This is a reoccurring pattern that can be used for massive profit once or twice a month.

Nope, back around 2004 or so there was a platform that allowed bets for cs, maybe cssource... it's been a while.
It was kind of like creating lobbies.  You would create a lobby and set it to 1v1, 2v2, etc. And also set the buy in amount, usually something low like a dollar or 2.  Or you could join someone else's lobby.
Once all the players were in, the game would auto start and at the end of the game you would get your funds credited or withdrawn.  
This was the first time that hacking was actually more than just for fun.  They had whatever shitty valve anti hack system but there's always a private wall hack that you could use.  It was great.  
Only thing that sucked was the system would take a 30% vig, but it was worth it because there was nothing like it at the time.  There were also tournaments for bigger money but you had to play carefully because many more people spectating and will kick you out if they can prove you're cheating.

Regulations are aimed at for profit services built around the blockchain, not the blockchain itself. 
Everything Satoshi created is and will continue to be free of regulation. We can still be our own banks. Self report to the IRS if you wish. 
However if we want coinbase, circle and friends to help us be our own banks, then these companies should be under higher scrutiny than the average shopify store.
Increased barrier to entry would have undoubtedly prevented some of the major heists we have seen.

Collusion is allowed in free markets, which through the decades has been proven to hurt the people.  
The current regulatory system is not ideal, but it is still better than no regulations at all.  Anyone who believes otherwise is an idealist refusing to accept reality.
Just wait until the bitcoin economy grows and is traded on traditional exchanges. You are right that self interests will align... that is the self interests of all of the major exchanges to manipulate price.  People will be begging for regulation once exchanges become the counterparties to the majority of derivative contracts... and the new NYSE index is a step in that direction.

I agree that a transparent system should bring more transparency.  But these are absolutely corrupt regimes, and the leap from publicly displayed corruption, as many of these countries experience now, to transparency does not make sense.
If a govt is corrupt, but now supports transparency, it's bs, not real.
If a third party is creating the new registry, then it won't be taken seriously.  Corrupt regime changes have proven to require violent revolutions, and I don't see how an overnight blockchain will actually disrupt anything

Because the American dream (home owenrship) cannot be realized in that scenario.  For a bitcoin economy to work, the way almost everything works today needs to be restructured to work in a bitcoin only economy.
Just consider population growth alone and a 21 million cap.  The year is 2050, and my personal wealth is 100 bitcoins.  I know that my children, and children's children will have to work 2x as hard to earn their 100 bitcoins.  
Edit, I guess in this example 100 bitcoins during my life are equivalent to my children's 50 bitcoins in terms of purchasing power.  But wow, talk about growing disparity between the rich and the poor.  At least now, the rich have to take even small risks (treasury bonds) to keep their children's trust funds from losing purchasing power.  In the bitcoin only scenario, the literally do not have o take any risks, besides keep their coins secure via epoxy
Edit2, honestly I don't believe bitcoin was designed to become the 1 true currency.  Bitcoin is an amazing technical feat for digital consensus, but global dominance? Doubt it... let's just take it for its merits and use it as it was purposed but pitching it as the future of global currency is unreasonable for many reasons

As you know, bitcoin requires the knowledge and motivation to secure coins, or trust a 3rd party.  It is up to the individual to educate themselves.
There are similarities to the financial crisis where banks marketed ARM mortgages to buyers who they knew were one unfortunate event away from not being able to repay.  A bitcoiners line of thinking would be to blame the buyer for not thoroughly reading the papers they  signed. Yes, banks have been proven, through large settlements, to be at fault. But so are the buyers for accepting the terms. 
Banks offered a product, and consumers accepted.  That is free market.
Banks were fined for not being more obvious with the risks.  But is it the responsibility of the bank to educate customers on the risk?  An individual needs to either have the skills to read a mortgage contract and I nderstand the risks, or hire a lawyer with fidicuciary responsibility to explain it.  
How is the required knowledge to secure coins different from this?
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:50:39
The risk is the capital invested, and the potential return is 100x on capital.  Bitcoin is not the only investment in the world that can offer this kind of risk-reward profile.
The key is the probability being assigned to each outcome.  If you believe that is 50-50, then bitcoin has an incredible expected return and you should go all in... what is the ev with these assumptions?
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:07:47
Lower interest rates discourage savings...
The real answer is that in a bitcoin only economy(single global currency) bitcoin's value is measured purely in purchasing power of goods, not in exchange rate against statist currency because they no longer exist.
Since bitcoin is limited in supply, the a single bitcoin will continuously buy more gallons of milk. With continued population growth, a bitcoin will be able to keep buying more stuff year over year.  This means that the mortgages of today are no comparable to the mortgages of the future. A future mortgage will not be principal + interest as it is today, because that is impossible.  I haven't actually thought this out because the whole idea of a bitcoin only global economy is absurd, but if it had to guess the mortgage would be linked to an index tracking the value of bitcoin against a basket set basket of goods. Meaning that a 30 yr mortgage for 100 bitcoin is converted to the increasing cost of the basket of goods.  Honestly the whole idea is absurd and will never work.  However that doesn't mean bitcoin can't succeed in the current niche market it satisfies

It is leasing a domain. Very high profile popular domains sell for millions of dollars. The one Roger Ver owns, because of first mover advantage, is a good one.

There is so much evidence spanning over a hundred years that proves regulation has helped consumer, vs zero regulation.
Just a recent example, predatory lending leading to the financial crisis.  Borrowers who knew they could no repay happily accepted the terms of their loans, and banks happily lent the money out.  That is free market.  Even with regulation, it happened... can you imagine the wild west of finance without any watchdogs?

Makes sense. There's little reasons to carry large sums of cash in a backpack. 
One reason that comes to mind immediately are cash auctions. For example tax foreclosure auctions in some cities require payment in cash or cash like vehicles like bankers checks.  I'm sure there's other examples, but not many.
Saying that you have a backpack with 20k in cash because you are moving across the country is sketchy because it should be in a national bank acct instead. And distrust of banks is not a legit reason

Classes are all relative. If 3.2 billion people come into the middle class, who is in the lower class? Think about it...
There will always be the bottom classes, if everyone in the world receives 1 million dollars tomorrow, there will still be the bottom 20% of poorest in conparison.  
Fighting to bridge the gap between the wealthy and poor is noble, but bring 3 billion people from poor to middle class just means there are another 3 billion newborns to fill the poor class

Cash in, bitcoin out is ez. The problems arise when cashing out.  For this reason a min prob of default should be set at least .5; meaning the moment fiat is converted to coins, the expected value is immediately negative.
For you degenerates out there, it's basically playing at a table where the vig is 50%.  GL and SFYFL

Everything Roger Ver said was true at the time.  The withdrawal problem was caused by the traditional banking system because it placed arbitrary limits on the number of outgoing wires for personal checking accounts.  In bitcoin, there is no limit and no differences between bitcoin personal and business accounts, unless coinwallet is giving out private keys again. Checkmate

I dunno, he was prob one of their best retail customers.  Tens of thousands in just incoming and outgoing wire fees.
If I recal, there were also other accounts like the US one where 5 million was seized.  
Also back in the day it was pretty difficult and shady getting bitcoins. People rarely cashed out, or only did so through merchant adoption.

Have you considered book rentals?  On demand cable channels are able to charge $5 plus for 24hr movie rentals.  
I know it may sound archaic to charge someone for your work, but the reality is that it allows you the time to write your next ground breaking book.  At the end of the day, a writer needs to earn a living, and if that's in bitcoin or dogecoin it doesn't matter.  The only thing that matters is that you have food on the table for you and your family.

20% return for a 9 month period is a win.  
Like you said, most people refinance their loans with new loans to fake the history, and then finally run off with the big score.
In the end, borrowers are not held accountable for defaulted loans.  It does not go on their credit scores.  Once that is fixed, ill be happy to invest, but obviously the return will be much lower, probably similar to what you would get on lending club
