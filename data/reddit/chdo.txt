thinking that cryptocurrency is good and that rampant homophobia, racism, sexism, etc. is bad isn't a confusing position...

i'm uninterested in wasting my time by debating bigots online, but nobody here is arguing legality. in so many words, they're just employing their right to free speech by expressing the opinion that the Gab and nothing more.

I’m actually in favor of designating broadband access a public utility, but I’d also point out that the differentiation of public vs private is no small “technicality” and, in fact, a core component of government and law.

You’re making a flawed, absolutist argument. I’m okay with an Internet platform choosing to deplatform someone for facilitating/participating in hate speech. I can be okay with this and not okay with other forms of censorship without being hypocritical in the same way I can be okay with some forms of pornography and not others.

coinbase is a private organization, not a government entity

i realize you're likely a lost cause, but i'll try anyway: 
the law around this issue is actually pretty fuzzy.  a number of states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi and South Dakota -- (and i'm assuming you're U.S.-based because of your love for the current President) allow businesses to refuse service on "moral grounds." additionally, businesses are legally categorized into divisions that have more/less freedom in choosing who they serve.  banks are public accommodations, but i wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase was classified as something else entirely, giving them significantly more freedom in choosing who they provide their service to than a traditional bank would have.
for the record, here's a list of reasons business **cannot** refuse service in New York: [ \- note that political affiliation (and I'd argue faux-libertarian, absolutist free-speech espousing moron is a political affiliation) is not on the list. further, choosing not to supply a service to an organization affiliated with or who directly promotes hate speech is different than refusing service to a particular category of person (i.e. race, sexual orientation, gender, etc.).
