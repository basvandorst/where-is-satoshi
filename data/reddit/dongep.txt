Bitcoin as decentralised banking in my opinion is not about ignoring consumer protection and KYC, it's about **making sure no one minority can control, get central access to, or significantly manipulate** the banking system. 
And with lightning this doesn't change in the end (I think).
Also you will always be able to use the high fee direct settlement to the block chain, LN is only for consumer adoption.

Isn't the difference that it does not increase node space requirement, therefore leading to less centralisation?

But could it be an option for the small number of people that don't want to settle via LN for whatever reason?

Yep, and I actually think it's funny! So far, I have never witnessed a joke that was completely horrible, that's why I really don't understand what all the outrage is about.
Sure, it plays with stereotypes, but it doesn't do it in a stupid manner imo.

Thing is, the more people have bitcoin, the more people can settle via bitcoin. Also this crazy price rise means people are incentivized to accept bitcoin as payments. Meanwhile people will hopefully get more and more educated and realize that spending in the ecosystem increases the value of their investment so they will be inclined to settle via bitcoin (at least I'd hope they won't just hoard it) and what does that mean? A boom as people look for newer and more innovative ways to be paid in bitcoin.
And even if the price falls, the realization that adoption and use is the ultimate value to bitcoin is a maximally stabilizing force.

That's not the same as printing money. It's more like a loan.
You might THINK you have those bitcoins but if enough people withdrew, you'd realize you don't.
That's different to printing money where you can't realise other than through inflation.

I never understood why you guys hate it so much tbh.

True, brother

Oups. Looks like my show-off of fancy maths failed pitifully.

So if I need to pay someone, my segwit address will guarantee a much lower fee for sub 10 min confirmation?
Most wallets will only offer things like 'economic', 'instant' etc. instead of allowing the user to set concrete fees; is 'instant' with a segwit address guaranteed or at least supposed to definitely net a lower fee than 'instant' with a non-segwit address?
Thank you for answering

Lal. the whole concept of KYC is about innocent until proven guilty not being good enough.

Wohoho. Calm your horses. This only struck me as funny, as they are especially asking for exactly 50k in collaborated donations.
No need to get all grumpy.
