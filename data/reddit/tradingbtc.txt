LOL, it's more specific about the chart pattern/price.

Thanks for your input and although you have correctly spotted a morning star pattern that is not what we are trying to highlight.  It has to do with both grey shaded boxes. A debate on technical analysis is not where we are trying to focus with this chart.

Not sure what you mean. We run a website that provides content to viewers and in this case we gave exposure to this analyst by embedding his video on the site.  If you had a video and we embedded it on our site and you got more exposure I don't see what the issue is.  We are a news website and we posted news so what is the issue? Viewers will see his video and then go to his channel and subscribe.

We are a news website and we posted news about what this analyst thinks about bitcoin and when people view his video they will go to his channel and subscribe.  What's the problem?

The analyst clearly stated his viewpoint but trading patterns are patterns that repeat so a trader has to look at all viewpoints and come to a conclusion and take action.  Buy, Sell or do nothing!

Here is a good video on whether bitcoin is going to drop like gold did back in 2011.  Very good analysis here:

Not sure what you mean as this video was made by another analyst so I thought it was a "very good analysis".  Why question whether it is legit or not?
