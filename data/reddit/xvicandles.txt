The man speaks truth.

That's how it reads to me, too.

I thought about that, but it seems like it's actually harder to put money in Cryptsy than other exchanges. You still need to go through verification hoops to have any money in your account at all, and, IIRC, they're about the same as other exchanges. And it looks like only checks work for getting money into the account. It just doesn't seem to add up.
Maybe there's some verification step that's easier. IDK.

Can you still backdoor bitstamp by making them a trusted gateway in ripple, or are they shutting down their ripple gateway?
If not, what's the point of killing unverified accounts if they could just grab USD (or, technically, USD denominated debt) through ripple?
If so, that's big news and would pretty much end ripple.

No, what's retarded is the number of people downvoting and trashing a hypothetical. Of course it's not going to happen, but there's value in discussing what the ramifications would be.
If they were to reject the UK money, they'd be left with a nascent sovereign currency that might not be terribly liquid in the first couple of years. What if they were to accept bitcoin for tax payments? Would that be helpful? What would that mean for their new sovereign currency? What would that mean for the adoption of cryptocurrency?
I expected responses like that, not "OMG you so retard not gonna happen." Of course it's not going to happen, but that doesn't mean there isn't value in thinking about it and discussing it.

Every coin on that exchange can be sold for BTC directly.

If they were dealing with Paycoin futures, CFTC would have jurisdiction. They aren't.

I really wish traditional banks did this, too, instead of having me have to go through their site to read communication. A gpg'ed email would be just as secure, and it would be an encrypted local record which, with the use of DKIM, could be directly tied to the servers of the bank that sent it.

Linking your bank account to any other bank or financial service usually requires validation of micropayments.
Don't worry. Once you get coinbase hooked up, it's a super easy service for buying and selling BTC. There's a little upfront time for setup like with anything financial, though.
(I've heard  is easier to set up, but that's just hearsay. I don't use it.)

So are they just sending .0001 BTC to every address that's ever been used? Novel advertising.

I don't even know what this "solution" would look like. People can roll their own public/private key encryption by hand. It's just math. You can't keep a master key. You can only do that if people use commercial programs for their encryption, and Bad Actors would just stop using that software and roll their own.
If you make encryption criminal, only criminals will use encryption.

I still don't understand how the 1MB cap will help limit the centralizing effect. You're still going to have large numbers of ASICs that hash at incredible speeds. It's not like my cell phone is ever going to compete with that.

Oh, I see. Thanks!

If you believe that, you can make a lot of money through arbitrage right now. 6% return over a few weeks is fantastic.

Thanks for the heads up.

I've been running 1.8.4 for forever, and I've never had a need to "upgrade."
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:53:50
This is good work.

It means you can directly change the source code of the project without having your submission approved.

Man, if you pick like any of the top seven on the first page, they have transactions. It's not a random search. He might have searched based on page numbers he thought of, which means page numbers that other people might also use. Coming up with a number isn't random, it's informed by life experience, some of which is shared by other people. It's more like typing in brain wallet phrases and hitting used keys. "who is john galt" has some transactions, man.

Right, there would be a massive increase in the potential money supply, and, supply and demand being what they are, the theory is that would cause a drop in price.
