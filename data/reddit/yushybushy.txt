I'm wondering, does a business still have to pay taxes on the bitcoin transaction?

But wouldnt you stil need to pay taxes?

Yeah but how do you do that with bitcoin? Do you send screenshots of your transactions? I doubt the owner did that.

Yeah posted on the forum a bit ago and it seems that soon after another post with a same problem followed. So i guess it's a problem on copay's side.

Apparently copay had a problem with the servers and many more people had the same problem. After 15 hours i got the money in the wallet. Thx for the tips everyone
