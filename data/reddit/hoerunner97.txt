I bet they wish they were holding the real bitcoin since 6.6 pounds but I guess they should hold onto this pretentious little fork in case he grows up to be something valuable.

This Christmas I gave hardware wallets to all of my family members, set them all up on segwit, transfered my funds to a segwit address and then sent a batch transaction to all of them. fees were completely reasonable. 
P.S. this thread helped a lot

I wonder if all the people with accounts over 2 years and excess of 10000 karma denying that this happens are all accounts that have already been bought.
Honestly after seeing what the Clinton campaign did with CTR, I wouldn't be surprised if there was less than 200 real people on r/bitcoin

If they couldn't make money off of fees, then they would have to make that money another way. They would have to say "I'm not making enough money to cover my electricity and make a profit, so I'm going to have to sell my bitcoin at a higher price." Every miner would have to charge more per coin, and the market would find the price point that keeps them in a profitable business model. Less money in fees would raise the value of bitcoin for everyone.

We should all put up ads on Craigslist saying that we will answer any questions about bitcoin via email for free. Maybe even offer people 1 USD of bitcoin if they set up an account.

tennis balls are great. Every now and then a red dot might show up on the tennis ball, which makes you want a tennis ball even more. As long as the dot stays on and moves with the tennis ball you will be so happy. Sometimes the red dot moves off of the tennis ball and you will chase after it for hours, and at the end of the day you wont have your tennis ball. This is the worst case scenario, but you'll get over it. Because you don't have the cognitive capability to see the man shining the red dot was just tricking you into giving up your tennis ball.

I love how she bashes Bitcoin for being made up, useless, and dangerous. And then compliments the speaker for saying "Mr and Mrs. 401k" as being quite good. This chairperson sure know's what's valuable in a society, I'm glad this individual has a job at the SEC.
