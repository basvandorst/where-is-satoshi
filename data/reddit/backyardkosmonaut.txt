I mean it's already down and predicted to drop 17% in 2017. It doesn't have to actually bomb to scare people into moving their money to a more stable currency and Bitcoin is the easiest way to do that without strapping physical cash to your gooch and getting on a plane.

What they don't normally do that?
 Traders weren't trading till a week ago? Buyers didn't want to make money till just now?
Granted idk much about it but that seems like a flimsy explanation.

Ok...So what's your hypothesis? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:36:29
Again...What's your hypothesis? I'm by no means an expert, just going on what my friends in china have told me they are doing to avoid being taxed when they move their money out of the country. 
Do you have another explanation with more to back it up? Because so far this thread has been all guesses and since that's the case I'd say my guess is as good as yours, unless you wanna explain why its not.

No obviously the amount people buy and trade changes. 
What is causing the change? 
Asking why the price of something goes up and getting the answer "well people are buying more of it" sounds really fucking dumb. Of course they're buying more but why? I already said I think it's Chinese buyers feeling pressure from currency woes. 
What specifically do you think is causing more people to buy? Im genuinely curious not trying to troll.

Chinese people trying to move their money offshore in a tax free manner before the yuan goes completely to shit in 2017.
