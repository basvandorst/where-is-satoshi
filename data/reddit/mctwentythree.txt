It’s over 9000!! We have done it once again!
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:10:20
very SOON @ 10890
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:33:36
Sort of, we are supposed to already be at 60K according to McAfee lol

Buy at ATH of course

I kept telling all my family, friends, and coworkers since this time last year to invest/buy, but all to laughs and side-eye 'good luck with that.' I truly believe we will see mass adoption in crypto in 5-10 years. It's only inevitable with growth in technology. I mean, they even have Bitcoin displayed in the Smithsonian in D.C. as the currency of the future!  [
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:30:01
um, yeah it did, and now we are about to break 10,400 and most likely hit 11K very very soon
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:03:56
And we just blew through **9600**! Onto 9700, here we go
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:30:49
Yep, I'm gonna guess so at this rate. Up we go!
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:45:18
We've done it bois, blew through 9700 and hit 9801
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:08:52
It's been a long 1.5 years.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:00:43
This is moving faster than Nov 26-29, 2017. crazy... awesome!
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:03:15
What a night, right?! I don't think I'll be sleeping :P
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:01:52
going to edit again? :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:35:05
Oh definitely. I fully expect the Alts to hit and exceed their ATHs if and only if BTC reaches ATH. Depending on your alt, look where it dumped to in Dec17. I'm not sure about FLDC though, it's even lower than previous so I probably wouldn't sell that now.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:32:05
Annnnd back above 8k, aw yeah
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:38:44
That’s what I said last Thursday. Freaked out after it went from 6300 to 6000 literally after I bought then next 24 hrs went to 6900. And now look. Don’t wait :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:08:19
Indeed. Indeed it is. Very very nice ;)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:21:12
Alts will bleed while bitcoin is on parabolic bull run because everyone will dump to join in on the bitcoin train. The actual dollar value of the alts will either stay the same or even slightly increase. Once BTC reaches ATH again, that's when to diversify again. Just look at Dec 7-10, 2017
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:03:13
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:48:46
Yeah, you should diversify into BTC
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:43:41
I agree. Just think, 2K @ current BTC versus 2K @ BTC ATH ;)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:25:59
I passed out after a happy hour. Wake up 5hrs later and am visibly shocked of the gains and it just keeps going :O
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:04:16
Go all in BTC. ETH like all other alts may have steady climbs here and there, but once BTC takes off like a rocket the alts will plummet. That is then the time to dive back into ETH. ETH will hit 1k again after BTC hits ATH again.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:45:16
So closeeeee
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:44:06
"**When you didn't \[buy\] Bitcoin at 3000$, nor 4000$, nor 5000$, nor 6000$** " nor $7000! :O
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:16:05
Why? Are you hoping to buy in again? Because I think the only way you’re gonna find that price again is during a possible pull back
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:35:39
Never sell, only buy when it dips :)
Edit: but seriously, buy and don’t touch. I learned like you did, hard, in late 2017

Coinbase is trending on the Apple App Store!
