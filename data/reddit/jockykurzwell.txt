Very fair point, hahaha.

That sounds logical, however, I'm getting more and more confused. How does electrum desktop keep track of incoming payments?
Thanks for the talk BTC :-)
@_date: 2014-07-20 11:15:03
There would've been space for the part that comes after the 'and'. If you give a source, don't cut it.

You, my sir, are a hero, gentleman and scholar. This is exactly why I posted the question, I am going to go nuts with this deal.
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:34:52
Now I fully understand the possibilities. Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:35:31
@_date: 2014-08-13 09:33:10
True, but for desktop/phone wallets, that's possible through the use of multibit and so on. Is there equivalent software to run on a server?
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:47:07
Yes, look around where? 20% is a lot and it would be Nice if you shared these gems. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:01:03
Reference, yo.
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:27:27
Me too.
But where would we get the 2% from?
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:07:18
What is the difference between electrum server and desktop? Why the need for a blockchain? Creating addresses and writing transactions is enough in both cases. What am I missing?
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:26:11
I can only find weloveservers.net, their cheapest plan is 4$/mo and 15GB won't run a full node. What am I missing? 'cause I want that 2$ deal, ten of them.
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:57:55
he would, just like you apparently. thats the point.
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:55:51
Probably ways to do so, think coloring. But nothing in the protocol as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:55:25
Yup, neo and bee. I was thinking of going to Cyprus to talk to some people there. But... 9 press releases, 15 topic, 24 prognoses and NO address da wilt visible?
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:26:17
PayPal thrives on being a central point in ecommerce payments. Why decentralize that. Trying to get lots of merchants to accept Bitcoin through their system would be easier and probably a lot more doable. 
Personally I do not think this would be sustainable for PayPal, but I can be wrong and you never know with these big firms.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:05:33
Really? That's the worst point if you ask me. QR codes are barcodes for geeks just like barcodes are barcodes for geeks.
Its visualized data that is translatable with software. 70 yo grannies use barcodes in libraries, stores, airlines, zoo tickets etc. The difference is that most protocols to read barcodes require a central database that tracks validity of the tickets as well as expensive equipment. While QR codes for bitcoin payments can be read with almost any phone and is understandable without the blockchain or any other database.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:52:22
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:50:47
No, to clarify why: an address isn't created or generated (in natural language, these terms are fine). They're picked. They represent nummers, of you look at it that way: looking at a number, you cant find out who picked it.

I was actually dicking around, do you know what p and np mean? Cause I think that if you do your question would have bene different. What do you mean by moving a currency to nondeterministic polynomial complexity?

Are you gonna try it?
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:10:34
I know this discussion isn't new, but I think the combination of media and the rich and famous is something we're used to in classical economics.
However, and extravagant guy like Kim Dotcom may form a risk for Bitcoin when he shows up in the newspapers with a 'f*ck the system song' again. If people realize that this guy owns a big share in the Bitcoin economy, it can be bad news for the trust people have in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:08:48
Poetic, that's all I can say. Satoshi is the creator, Keiser is the evangelical. Who will complete the holy trinity? I hope for bit's sake it's not Dotcom.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:24:25
You're right, the model they use are CFD's

Will Cyprus' Economical breakdown be the economical breakthrough for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:50:37
Stablitity in price, yea sure. But Bitcoin needs entrepreneurship, we need to be able to buy regular stuff. Market making is all nice, but that's not what Bitcoin is all about.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:57:15
Thanks, yea it does.
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:23:29
Sure, but if some acresses latest facelift is news, Bitcoin better profit of it publicitywise
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:26:09
I do not think he is a hero, the propagandical clips, the extravagant behaviour and the kicking against the system is not what we need. Kim Dotcom is getting to many followers within the group of people that will prove to be very very dangerous in the next couple of years.
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:36:36
Does anybody know why?
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:27:03
I don't assume they are lost, but if Satoshi doesn't want Bitcoin to fail (Seems not to farfetched to think) he wouldn't make one single transaction with these blocks. If he would, everybody would know that 8% of all Bitcoins are in one guys hands, and they can be spent. Bitcoin would collapse.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:51:06
Of course, that's the thing about it. It doesn't matter whether the movie is a good one. The point is that it may start a trend of bitfunding.
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:12:45
Thanks, fixed.
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:50:58
Thanks for the compliment (even if it wasn't intended as one :-P).
The directory is growing every few hours, and we're performing interviews with some Bitcoin entrepreneurs in the Directory. I hope the community is interested in their view.
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:28:36
Ouch, were they worth it?
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:19:45
I Agree, a lot of the bigger wallets are either companies or lost old ones. However, a lot of early adopters must have 10 thousand of them. And we know of a few investors like the Winkelvosses, Max Keiser, Kim Dotcom is probably one, early Silk Road merchants, Pizza delivery men, companies selling VSP early on and the list goes on and on. I think 40 is a good guess.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:25:38
A few thousand people with more than 10.000 BTC would mean that there are a couple of tens of million BTC, which isn't the case.
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:59:08

I believe it'll come down soon, there's this TV program in planning.

@_date: 2013-04-24 03:06:06
The first couple of thousand. Where only one test transaction has been done.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:48:33
I understood, but you said spam is saying things over and over, and I said say that again, so... Just kidding
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:15:39
Yes i'm sorry, I know what CFDs are. But the idea is the same, possible gain from Bitcoins 'devaluation'
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:19:06
E-wallets are a bad idea, but that is a fact so obvious I can't really feel sorry for everyone. 
I do not want to be a party pooper, but I've got a serious question.
I know the operators of InstaWallet didn't have access to private keys, but just think about this: If they haven't got access to the keys but they wanted access to the keys just for shizzles and giggles, isn't this the way to do it? "Hey, something went wrong so please send uss your keys and we'll wait 90 days to claim you key was given twice so we won't pay you, nanana." 
So I guess my question is, am I wrong about the fact that the only thing that gives them access to your funds is the keys they request you to mail them?
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:24:47
Say that again?
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:45:14
Why do you think Bitcoin is worth 30-50 at most? In other words, what reason do you see that the market cap should be 300.000.000? Thats kind of an arbitrarily low number of a monetary system, don't you think? 
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:47:39
Classic case of the 'sew me's', is it like when they started building CERN these murcans were afraid they created little black holes, but with creating little planet earths?

That's my point, however, I'm not going into the silverscreen business. :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:44:53
Of course, the effect will be different in the future. But remember, a million blocks will always be a little more than 4% of all of Bitcoin, belief that 4% of a currency can be sold will destroy the value. Bitcoin or no Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:24:38

@_date: 2013-04-23 22:39:27
The shock will be there as soon as one of those blocks are touched, remember, we can see every transaction and we can see it when the early blocks get spent.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:58:42
Sorry for the typo, the article has been edited. We don't know if it's legit yet. But we've invited Knc for an interview on Bitcoin Square.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:26:35
Thats the problem, I have never been interested in e-wallets so I have never tried to fathom the way they work. I just guess that if someone puts their money in an e-wallet they made sure it was safe. Was Instawallet not provably safe? In that case, why the hell would you give Bitcoin to a few guys that know JS and JSON that know the private keys? I would really really be disturbed if that is true.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:56:48
Yup. Get some Bitcoin create an encrypted wallet. Leave the passphrase in your head and possibly partly written down and upload the shit out of your encrypted wallet. Let entropy do the rest.

'twas about the joke, my good sir.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:51:55
You don't get the point, It does not matter if he spends or sells. As soon as a transaction transpires from one of these blocks, people will know there is 4% of their currency that can be thrown onto the market at any time. And because they don't want to wait for it, they'll sell. Whether Satoshi actually sells or not.

Of course, a large sum of money is stolen from a large group of people that trusted one guy to handle it. And within a few hours, somebody has been blamed for it. Not somebody that is hard to find, but somebody who is known for doing this stuff. And to make everything a little more easy for the trusted bloke to act like he's doing everything he can (while the real thief is picking a new jetski), the blamee left contact information. 
This all makes me think about something that happened years and years ago, when I think of it, I think it was 2008 or something. But luckily, because this happened, we adopted a crypto-currency that was handled by a peer-to-peer network, for this should not happen again.
Keep. Your. Bitcoin. Safe. And. Keep. It. YOURSELF!

This sadly is your only choice. Coinbase's infrastructure is to young to keep up with the growth and they will make mistakes. They do not have a solid plan for customer support but they probably are watching social media. I don't agree with your choice to call them thieves, however, it will get you their attention and they will be happy to resolve the issue, hopefully.
