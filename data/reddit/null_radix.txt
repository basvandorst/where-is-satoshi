i saw you select Vitalik. Are you considering using Ethereum?   I think making a simple contract would be more effective than backing with the bitcoin blockchain.

...  
 if notes and coins were abolished and the only way to hold money was through a government-controlled bank, there would be no escape.  
...  
Finally, the “black economy” will be hugely diminished, and tax evasion made all but impossible.
sounds like Utopia to me!

One thing is for sure. Alternative Bitcoin Implementations absolutely can not Co-Exist on this sub! Thou shalt not have strange Implementation before me!

Whoever is doing this is doing it on their own and is not related to the Ethereum community at all.

what part of the title is misleading?

funny this article is allowed here, but ethereum is an alt-coin so any discussion of it is banned.

**Email:** messages get sent to and from email servers where they are stored to be retrieved later by the recipient and sender.     
**Retroshare:** messages get sent directly to and from the recipient and sender.  If the recipient is not online the message is broadcast to friends that you both trust. Messages are encrypted also. 
**Bitmessage:** messages are broadcast to the network and everyone on the network downloads them. Similarly to how everyone running a bitcoin client downloads the blockchain. Messages are encrypted; this way only the intended recipient can read them.

no I meant, how do you get the data back from OSM? but I found your github i see you are using 
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:05:05
really cool map! how exactly do you get that data from OSM? OSM always seem to be a bit slow for me.

but is it in the mind of the Chinese? There maybe a lot more newbie than you expect.

yeah but anarchism was historical impart  defined as being anti-capitalist.  And capitalism was defined as being an oppressive alliance between the state and capitalists.
Today's world is different than when those terms first came into being. Capitalism has been democratized... everyone can be a capitalists! it is the american dream! So capitalism is now seen as liberating instead of oppressive. After that concept seeped into our culture's collective conscious it paved the way for an-caps. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 01:09:55
as a some what "radical anti-capitalists" I think this is ridiculous. If they end up buying a enough of this debt they will eventually just make the price of the 'bad debt' go up by creating demand for it. This is simple crowd-sourced funding for the capitalists who own the debt in the first place.

If you are interested I think that the bitcoin protocol is sort similar to the concept of [direct democracy]( A core anarchist concept
Here is an excerpt  


@_date: 2013-03-27 21:26:58
really? over at I would say there is some interest. The thing is bitcoin has potential to help anarchism in its aims but is not an inherently anarchist activity in itself.
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:07:27
yeah exactly! but also more generalized. so like crowd-sourced FedEx + crowd-sourced greyhound.

It would be nice if it were federated too. Then someone could indepently stepup an instance on the clear web also. This could also lead to its use as a local rideshare system. With each community independently running their own instance. Hitchhikers and Taxis companies could almost go extinct. 
EDIT: 
Also use as an rideshare could obfuscate the white market with the black market.
