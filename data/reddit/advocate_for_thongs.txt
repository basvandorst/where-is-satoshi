The delusion here is absurd.

That's what I mean. It seems impossible a lightning network could function better than what we already have and be remotely user friendly.

I'm pretty sure it's considered a commodity by the us govt

Or they are DAG based

Does any of this really sound like a feasible solution to you?

And take your coins off of the exchange. If you don't hold your private keys, you don't really own your coins.

Though I agree with most of what you said, don't you think that increasing the block size to actually make the cryptocurrency usable in the short term is necessary? Like what is the point of having BTC right now? It's so expensive to use that it isn't practical. LN kind of makes sense, but until that can actually be implemented, something needs to be done. But even then, LN seems flawed as a concept to me since it seems like a ton more computing and processing power will be necessary to create and find payment channels off chain. Sure, it will save space on the block chain, but it doesn't really seem like an ideal solution. I don't think a given cryptocurrency will succeed unless it can be used like cash: with instant transfer of ownership. Lastly, is there a reason why nodes would have to have every single block stored locally instead of like the last 500 or something? Obviously you would want many copies of the full block chain, but surely a fully copy at every node is kind of overkill.

Dude putting all of your savings in an extremely risky investment probably isn't the best idea. There is a very real possibility you will lose all you have, however small that possibility is.

Bitcoin has no "true value." It is only worth what people are willing to pay for it.  Block chain technology and cryptocurrencies are absolutely here to stay, but I'd be surprised if Bitcoin retained its current value. Bitcoin right now isn't even feasible as a currency because of extremely high transaction fees and long confirmation times, and there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies with numerous advantages over Bitcoin. The main thing Bitcoin has going for it is name recognition and therefore perceived value.  It might survive simply as a "store of value" coin, but bitcoin's future is anything but certain. If you actually have your life savings in BTC, I would highly suggest pulling out to a point where you would be OK if the value went to zero.

So since I replied I've done some research and what I was talking about before is called block chain pruning and is something that is already done frequently to keep hard drive usage small. Partial nodes are nodes without the entire block chain. Obviously, you are correct in that the most security would come from having all nodes be full nodes, but I don't know how feasible that is going into the future as crypto becomes more mainstream. There has to be diminishing returns the further back on the block chain you go. I do see the need for the entire block chain to be stored in a decentralized manner, though. I hope that LN can be totally seamless, but most descriptions of it seem like, as an end user, I would have a bunch of BTC tied up in certain channels, almost like preloading gift cards to places I do business with.  This doesn't seem as ideal as just using cash, where the transfer of value is instantaneous and absolute.

Could you point me towards a resource outlining some of your points? Specifically, I don't see how Bitcoin is superior to LTC or Bitcoin cash, especially in terms of scalability. It seems that with a 1mb fixed blocksize, BTC is doomed to fail to scale as a currency. It could very well remain a store of value, but I feel as though that is less desirable than a true currency. I don't keep my money in gold bricks because it's a pain in the ass and I would have to convert it to USD to use it.  granted, converting BTC to another crypto currency is easier than gold to USD, but the fees are pretty prohibitive for any small transactions.

Probably like 15 grand

Yeah you should probably sell those and invest in a well diversified index fund.
