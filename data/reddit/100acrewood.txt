The research topic is actually pretty interesting and pertains more to alternatives to traditional identity verification (using birth dates, employment history, etc.) by instead using the blockchain. I read it much more as a "how can we use this technology for improved security for everyone" rather than "how can we track people using this technology".

You said you bought at $20 so I'm assuming you didn't mine any of them then. If that is true:
(a) if you are a US citizen and you later sold them for USD, or used them to buy stuff, talk to your parents and get a tax accountant to help you out. You will need to report "capital gains" taxes for your earnings based on the date you bought and sold them.
(b) if you have NOT sold them or bought anything with them, then you don't have to do anything. Keep them safe and just know that when you do sell them or buy stuff, you will need to the capital gains taxes on that year's tax return.
(c) if you aren't a US citizen then I have no idea.
The IRS will never send you a form. It is your responsibility to file taxes as required. It is confusing at first, but it gets easier once you have filed taxes a few years and/or worked with an accountant.
Regardless, you may want to talk to you parents about it so they can read up on it and be prepared for if/when you do decide to cash out or use your bitcoin. Better to be ready and informed ahead of time.

All other things equal, the benefit of bitcoin in this situation is in the circumstance when you are all paying the bill separately, rather than a single person paying the bill and you paying that person back.
With many bitcoin merchant apps, when you make a partial bitcoin payment, the QR code and balance will update to reflect the amount remaining. So if you have 4 parties, each could make a payment, and you'd see the balance decrease after each payment is made. With PayPal it would take quite a while to enter all your CC information, or username/password for each person. It just isn't convenient. With Venmo you have to send money directly to the other person, rather than the merchant. 
Remove bitcoin from equation: the idea of "programmable currency" is beneficial over any payment gateway for these situations simply due to the flexibility you have with handling the user experience.

You do not pay the conversion fee from BTC &gt; USD, the merchant does. And that merchant just saved 3-4% by you not using a credit card. That means the 1% transaction fee for them back to USD is still a profit even if they gave you a discount (and mind you Coinbase charges 0% fees up to $1 million).
Also not all merchants convert back to USD. I own two companies both which do not convert back, and I know of another business in my area that also does not convert back. We are early adopters of Bitcoin and so we do what we can to support the economy at this stage.

True that first world countries benefit less than other countries when using Bitcoin, but there are still many benefits. Since you specified "average American" I'll limit my response to that subset of the global population. If you aren't aware of benefits of other countries with more volatile currencies just look up Cyprus in 2013.


Why are you going USD &gt; BTC &gt; USD? The point is to go USD &gt; BTC and spend. Thus you are only charged 1% in the conversion from USD &gt; BTC, and then you buy your goods at a discount from a merchant that offers one for BTC purchases. Some merchants offer 5% for Bitcoin purchasers.


Yes you are charged tax on your GAINS. So if you gain $1,000 and are taxed $350 on it, you still made a net profit of $550.


Same goes for investing in stocks or bonds. Don't like risk, don't invest. Put your money safely in a bank and lose 2.5% guaranteed each year due to inflation. And you can still write off your losses as a tax deduction.


You also could gain a lot in a short period of time. If you don't want to worry about that risk, don't convert USD to BTC until you are ready to make a purchase. Thankfully the USD is not volatile, so this is the main reason we will be one of the last countries (assuming no economic collapse) to adopt BTC.
Outside of the direct comparison of value to USD, here is a conversation I had with another redditor that explains the benefits to a consumer: 
All that said, Bitcoin shouldn't be considered as an either/or to the USD. At this point in time Bitcoin has benefits over USD described in the link above, but the USD also has benefits right now too. They work an tandem for the purpose at hand. I believe in Bitcoin's future, but that doesn't mean I don't still use USD for most purchases today.

I'm on my third business venture and you really hit the nail on the head. Being an entrepreneur in any industry is tough. But add bitcoin on top and it adds another amount of risk and pressure. You now rely on a new technology that many have never heard of or areliance misinformed about. You have skeptics and large institutions with a vested interest to stop it. It all piles up, and from experience I know stress presents itself in odd ways. It takes a certain type of person to be able to cope with the stress and struggles of entrepreneurship, which us why it really helps to buddy up with a mentor or business partner. I never could have made it as far as I have without the support of others in my life. Never hesitate to ask for help or talk to other entrepreneurs about struggles. We're all in the same boat together.

Doh, you're right. I haven't linked an account in a few months and forgot the second step. Even if the other method (verifying two deposits) works, either way you are basically in control of the account, which I doubt any employer would be willing to do just to pay someone in BTC.

 is multi-sig, doesn't store private keys, and even utilizes nLockTime so if their site ever disappeared your coins would be returned to you. It is one of the "safer" web wallets for those reasons.
For Android - Mycelium is my preferred app. They are releasing an HD wallet version soon so even if you upgraded the OS and somehow lost your wallet you could restore it. I think any open-source HD wallet (including Wallet32) is great for a hot wallet.
As others have said though, if you are storing large amounts of bitcoin savings, I'd buy a Trezor. Simple, easy and secure.

Well put. If they treat it like a currency now, what happens when smart property and decentralized exchanges like Counterparty are being used on the regular?

I'd rather see coin mixing or some other method of anonymity built directly into the Bitcoin protocol. Zerocoin is an extension which means it is not required, but I would rather see this functionality built right in and "always-on". Andreas Antonopoulos talks about this a lot and I think he is 100% correct that it should have a higher importance, and is necessary for Bitcoin's future.
So, in light of today's news we should all be raising awareness and working to get this into the core.

To give you some more comfort OP, I experienced an issue with the Trezor web wallet where I generated about 6 receiving addresses (let's call the A, B, C, D, E and F), and sent coins randomly to a few of them out of order (to B, D and F). The trezor web wallet was not updating my balance since it wasn't looking past address A. I contacted support and they said to send a small amount to addresses A, C and E, but even after doing that there was one transaction that was not being recognized. Lesson learned: always send money to trezor using the receiving address displayed and not to later addresses! They said they'd be fixing the bug in a future release (a very fast response from support).
So I ended up using Wallet32, entering my 24 word phrase, and using the longer rescan method it recognized all of my coins. From there I wiped my trezor and resent the coins.
Wallet32 is open source and I've looked through the code (I'm an android developer myself) and it is safe. I've heard rumors that Mycelium should be support HD Wallets very soon as well.

Since Trezor uses BIP39 (which in turn is based on BIP32) you can use various applications to restore your wallet. When I first got my Trezor I ran through the process of restoring to another wallet in case of failure, just so I was familiar and comfortable with the process.
I was able to send money to my Trezor, then use [Wallet32]( for Android to restore my funds using the 24-word seed.
Pretty easy process, and now that piece of paper with my seed is worth more than the Trezor itself :-P

When I first dove into Bitcoin it was all I though/talked/read about. My wife was subjected to political rants, economic theories, price tickers, and the highs and lows of every week. I found that what I really needed was an outlet. Reddit is great but the brief conversations and debates don't give you the ability to really stop and process everything you've seen throughout the day. So I started a blog which really forced me to spend more than 5 minutes reading an article and upvoting/downvoting. It also put my energy to better use, and after writing a 5 page post I was usually tired of thinking about Bitcoin and wanted to go do something else. This eventually lead to starting a new Bitcoin-based business which forced me to focus on the important topics, and ignore the small stuff (such as daily price swings).
Since you are still in school you obviously don't have a ton of free time, but if you are passionate about something you should welcome it and help it grow rather than hope that it will fade. If Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance it will open up an entire new industry. You didn't mention your major, but a lot of professionals are very successful by merging two of their interests together which helps separate them apart from others in their industry.  Take the risk, put yourself out there, and apply everything you learn through your coursework to bitcoin. You might find an innovative idea that you could grow into a new product or service that merges Bitcoin with another industry or niche. Obsessions and passions like this don't come along many times in life, so identify the fears and reservations that make you want to just be "laid back" and complacent, and take them head on.

What type of bitcoin plugin are you looking for specifically? Something that simply generates dynamic QR codes for you and sends the payment to you? Maybe something that uses a blockchain.info wallet? I'm a web/mobile developer that has created a few WordPress plugins, and if you send me some specific requirements I might be able to create a WordPress plugin for the community. I can't promise a quick turnaround, but I like to contribute in any way possible. 
It reminds me of the early days of WordPress. Every time I needed a plugin I ended up having to develop it myself. It was great for the community but frustrating when I was working against a strict budget and a looming deadline. In this case it is a niche market ("WordPress plugin developers") of a niche market ("Bitcoin"), so the number of active open source contributors is pretty few and far between.

What I'm getting at is as the borrower, how do I know I'm not giving my loan proposal with personal information to a depositor that is actually an identify thief? Depositors (or the proxy reviewing the application) need that personal information to review the risk, and to have proof of the borrower's assets/income. But the borrower needs to know they're not giving that info to a scam artist.
Unless you have a programmable way to remove the completely remove the trust required between a depositor, lender, and borrower, you are still going to have to require some type of identification and vetting process between the borrower and each person that is reviewing their loan.

You can use this site (a fork of bip32.org and modified to include Trezor):
Transfer this to an offline computer for safety. In the source code there is an "english" folder with an index.html page you can open to view in english (unless you speak japanese). Then:
To test your 24-word passphrase:
* Select 24 words
* Enter your passphrase
* In "Derivation Path" choose "Trezor k'th account i'th keypair (receive): m/44'/0'/k'/0/i"
* Go into your MyTrezor.com wallet, go to the "Receive" tab and click on the address you want to try and re-generate. Under the QR code there is a path like this "BIP32 Path: m/44'/0'/**k'**/0/**i**" where k/i are actual numbers. You will need the values of "k" and "i".
* Back on the bip32 site, for "account (k)" put in the "k" value from mytrezor.com.
* For "Keypair index(i)" put the "i" value from mytrezor.com.
* Look at "Address" and it should match what is shown on MyTrezor.com
* Try it for a few and you'll know if it is working pretty much right away. If the address comes up but isn't the same then you likely put the wrong values for k/i or typed your password wrong.
Let me know if you have any trouble. I've been working with BIP44/BIP32 a lot recently so I'm happy to spread the knowledge.

I've been using Mycelium for about a year, and since their HD Wallet release it has become the only wallet I use for "semi-hot wallet storage". As cygnus_X mentions, malware could possibly be a problem, but you'd have to first download the malware which is of course a risk based on your user patterns. I would avoid downloading random "bitcoin price ticker" apps. And make sure you have a backup of the passphrase.
There aren't many apps that I would trust as a "full time wallet", but Mycelium and Greenaddress are probably two of my favorites (though IMO GreenAddress' user interface is even more complex and I don't recommend it to non-technical people for that reason).

It is a bitcoin wallet without volatility. This gives you the ability to have your money "in bitcoin" but pegged to the value of a currency. So for someone that doesn't have access to a bank but doesn't want to deal with the volatility of bitcoin, it is useful. Or for a merchant that accepts bitcoin but doesn't want to convert back to USD, they don't have to speculate on price.

I doubt the protocol will end up being the limitation at that time. The tipping point will be the beginning of mass adoption. My personal opinion on what that point will look like:
* Users no longer wonder if an exchange is going to move offices overnight and prevent you from accessing your funds for months on end.
* When 10% or more of your Facebook friends have purchased a Bitcoin.
* When users can safely store Bitcoin without worrying about viruses (hardware wallets)
* Users that *choose to use a traditional "bank"* can store their Bitcoin online alongside their fiat money.
* One or more countries have defined their regulatory regimes, and those regimes make companies and investors that have been waiting for the "ok" jump in. (Could be banks, brokerages, credit unions, etc.)
Just speculation, but that is what I foresee. 
Think of email: non-technical people weren't sitting in forums researching the progress of email as it was being developed. That is where we are now with Bitcoin. Email caught on as word of mouth took over and the every day Joe saw how it would make their life easier. If signing up for email required a dedicated offline Linux PC, a sheet of paper, a printer, etc., nobody would have used it. 
In sales, you define a person's "pain point" and use that to define how your product/service will resolve that pain. Once Bitcoin provides enough utility to resolve a pain point in the every day person it will being mass adoption.  Today, every time we get a bubble it is because a bunch of new speculators are coming in, but then the price detaches from the true value. When it hits the tipping point people won't be panic buying, they will just be buying Bitcoin for some mundane purpose...buying cheeseburgers, sending money to a family member, donating to a good cause, etc. Mass adoption is less about "I need as much as possible right now to get rich and/or stick it to the banks", and more "I just got paid and it happens to be in Bitcoin".
The tipping point is where there are enough people that are actually buying Bitcoin and having a good experience with it, that they tell their friend. And their friend finds it a very easy/beneficial process, they tell their friends. And exponentially, the users start flooding in. Exponential growth is very difficult to comprehend as humans, which is why it has been said that when we hit the tipping point it will be unlike anything we've experienced before.

Some additional comments to your response:
Push, not pull: yes in most cases the arbitrator is usually favorable toward the customer. But it isn't always as easy as just calling the credit card company and getting that money back. Check out the [Enzyte scam](


It took two years for the president to be indicted. The customers had to deal with quite an ordeal from the fraudulent charges. They may have gotten their money back from the credit card companies, but it wasn't as simple as a single phone call since they had initiated the first subscription purchase. Having to deal with arbitration process and legal battle is something that wouldn't occur with push purchases.
Security: Sure it just "hurt" the banks/credit card company, but it is still an inconvenience you again don't have to worry about with Bitcoin. No more re-issuing cards, waiting for the money to be credited to your account, no arbitration, no worries of theft at all. That said, I do agree the area of consumer protection may be lacking right now when it comes to things like getting refunds back from merchants, or an exchange/wallet service absconding with funds.
Accessibility: Okay so a 0.2% fee if they use an exchange like bitstamp, 0% if they use coinbase and do less than $1 million in transactions, or 1% with Bitpay (or they can just pay $30/month for zero fees). Still much less than credit card for the merchant, and now they can increase revenue by accepting another method of payment.

Maybe not *yet* but if there is a 
 market need for insured bitcoin deposits, someone will fill it. What if I offer to insure your entire Trezor wallet balance for a fraction of a percent of the balance per year? Got scammed? Got you covered. Product not sent? No problem.
My personal opinion is that type of thing will arise. The most secure wallets will be supported, possibly by the developing company themselves. The process of recovery might be pretty arduous, but fraud prevention is an added risk for the providing company.

Under US law (which isn't the case here, but nonetheless), if Karpeles were found to be using the "corporate facade" to be protecting him from criminal actions, the veil is removed. Also if the business transactions and corporate structure is used to disguise the true nature of what is occurring behind the scenes in order to deceive the parties, the veil can also be removed (i.e. fraud). 
You can't just create a company and then commit fraud, and have yourself personally protected. Since they are going after him for fraud, I don't think the corporate veil will withstand if he found guilty of those accusations.

True, changing the mining algorithm would probably do more harm than good since most major miners would have useless hardware on their hands (and in turn would lose confidence in mining in the future). 
Instead of changing the protocol maybe the answer here is there needs to be more ASIC manufacturers to meet the demand and drive down the price of equipment, and co-location mining facilities located where electricity is cheap. Right now there aren't many chip manufacturers, and so as soon as a new product is released, the larger miners can just buy them all up (or strike an exclusivity agreement). The market may naturally end up figuring this out in the end.

Push/Pull: I'm not 100% positive, but I believe some CC did not refund the charges right away. It was an ongoing process over months and months to prove that there was actual fraud occurring. If you watch American Greed Season 4, "Sexual Performance Pill" it goes into greater depth, which is where I got this point from. In fact regardless of Bitcoin that show is pretty entertaining and informative. 
The problem is that at first you trust a company and think "well it must've been a mistake" and then you keep getting charged and they say "don't worry we cancelled it; refund is on your way" and then weeks later you get charged yet again. Then you have to prove to the CC processor that you had tried to cancel the charge (your word against theirs). And for a brand new company with very well done marketing, there may not be enough information out there to assess the risk from a consumer reports standpoint, regardless if the BBB is useless (which I agree).
Security: My point was more about the security on the merchant side (protecting your data/information) in which case Bitcoin is more "secure" since that data isn't given out. But I totally agree that from a consumer standpoint if you are not well versed in computer security then you are at a very high risk. I think hardware wallets will be absolutely necessary for mainstream adoption, because we can't expect everyone to have an offline Linux PC used for cold storage, to know to use one exchange but not the other, and to setup 2 factor authentication right away. There is way too much to learn right now to use it, so for the general population it is definitely much better to just use traditional methods. But in a future where we have hardware wallets (and hardware safes), I think the security will be automatic. So my point here may have more weight to it in the future from a consumer computer security stance.
Accessibility: whoops, you're right. I was stuck on the merchant stuff from the security reply. So yes, if your friends are converting to fiat that is a valid point. Though I'm happy to pay $0.01 to the dollar for a bar tab and avoid a $2 ATM fee. And yes the requirement to register with a service may be an argument now (though you can send BTC to people without an account if they didn't want to convert to fiat right away using [Coinapult]( but if Bitcoin does become mainstream then that would be less of an issue. It would be like asking a person if they have an email address if it reached that level. In which case volatility will decrease due to the market pool size. Of course any argument for or against Bitcoin has to be constrained to a point in time, since right now there are less benefits than there will be in the future if it gains mainstream adoption. 
Even as someone that believes in Bitcoin from every standpoint, I agree that all of your concerns right now regarding store of value, bad exchanges, and wild-west marketplaces are completely true. Which is why anyone in can be considered an early adopter, because we have to deal with all of these issues. But all of us early adopters that do believe in it are forward-thinking to where it is widely adopted and these growing pains are resolved. In the present it is definitely a risk/reward situation which is why speculators flock to it. But over time as it grows these issues will be resolved by the market, and regulation (regardless if we want it or not, it is coming). Or it will completely fail and everyone will laugh at us :-)

Here is why the idea of regulated mining that Allaire fantasizes about would ruin one of the primary benefits of Bitcoin:
Let's say they work out a treaty and we end up with 100 mining cartels around the globe. These cartels are regulated and monitored by government authorities. Since these authorities are now overseeing all of the mining power, it gives them the ability to manipulate Bitcoin withing changing the protocol. They would be able to blacklist certain bitcoins by decreeing that miners must not include those transactions in future blocks under penalty of law (which is improbable now since mining is decentralized). Even if each mining facility in these cartels do not have more than 50% of the hash rate, the entire collective mining would be under the regulation and power of a single collective government. They could then set the required transaction fees, and essentially tax the global population via increased transaction fees as needed.
I can accept certain levels of regulation, but that type of talk from someone that has been on most major US government panels is scary. It completely negates the entire purpose of Bitcoin.
I know it is tin-foil hat thinking, but Allaire started it.

It is definitely a good question and it will be interesting to see. I would be greatly saddened if a cryptocurrency didn't become a global currency simply because I want to live during the era when it occurs and experience the outcome first hand.
I agree that people will never use the decimal notation; it is just too difficult to scan and read. My guess is that until Bitcoin is actually used as a global currency, prices will always be in USD/Euro/etc. Us early adopters love the technology, but non-technical people just want their coffee, which will always be $3.50 (or whatever). They don't care how much a single bitcoin costs unless they are holding it as a speculative investment or store of value. When it becomes main stream, the apps available will handle it so well that you won't be thinking in terms of BTC vs. fiat. You'll just trust the app, scan the QR code and be done. (Or use a Bitcoin-based debit card once those are available). Most apps already do this, but I think it still could be greatly improved.
I am torn about the future terminology of mBTC/uBTC/satoshis though. I used to think that in my lifetime, I wouldn't see everyday people talking about it (assuming bitcoin is the currency that survives). It would be hard to picture everyone talking in terms of "mBTC" and "uBTC" when referring to price. But then I thought about the internet: nobody knew or cared what a kilobit or megabit was until the internet went mainstream. Now you could go up to most people and say "I was downloading a video at 28kbps in 1990" and they'd know what you were talking about. I think younger generations are able to adapt to technical terminology a lot quicker that older generations in a non-technical field since we grew up with it. And our future generations may live in a world where cryptocurrencies always existed. So it will be easier for them to adapt to the idea of a global currency, and paper money is some extinct concept in the way that gold coins is to us today.

You could, though you could experience slippage with large orders. I don't know how much the max amount is in this system though. Also there aren't exchange fees (for now) with this.

In regards to Tor: at that point mining would take up a significant amount of power (warehouses full of miners required to even get shares of a pool). I would imagine they would investigate locations with suspiciously high energy bills and raid them if they discovered large server warehouses, rather than try to target users via IP address. It might take a lot longer to find the "criminals", but it could be done. It would be like a modernized counterfeiting. Also like Ashlir said, since they control the validation, any coin not awarded originally to a known miner is automatically blacklisted.
I imagine another coin taking over would be more likely at that point, or the protocol changing to benefit the many rather than the few.

Where are you located? One of the big considerations in the USA is AML/KYC compliance both at the federal level (FinCEN) and the State level. Some ATM operations handle this for you, but if you are handling compliance on your own it is a pretty big factor of both time and cost. Creating a federal AML compliance program is in the low 5-digits as far as legal costs go, and takes months to draw up. That is just for the feds, whereas at the state level it depends on their local legislation.

I respect the various opinions on regulation, but I know that many regulations end up helping large existing businesses by creating a huge barrier of entry for new startups. Just look at how FinCEN has already cut out a lot of hopeful entrepreneurs already by having a stance the coincides more with existing laws of money transmission rather than adopting new rules. Technology adapts quickly, and if you have these overbearing regulations in place, it means you need to react even more quickly which is simply impossible. If the government stops trying to protect consumers from themselves I think the market would be able to grow over time.
Regardless of my opinion, regulation is coming, but I hope it is one that makes it much easier to enter the market rather than stifling that innovation. I am hopeful the NYDFS truly does try to get avoid the archaic laws of registering in every state in the US for Bitcoin businesses. That is absurd in an internet-based global economy. The best outcome from these US hearings is that they have minimal regulation, but just enough to build the confidence of banks, credit unions and other corporations to start working with Bitcoin companies.

I wouldn't want three random "depositors" reviewing my salary, net worth, work history, tax statements, favorite ice cream flavor for a large loan. And if you aren't providing any of that personal information, there is no way for a depositor to judge the risk involved.
If you have to trust some random person, wouldn't it just be easier to just have a traditional commercial loan officer be the one that reviews the applications, and the "depositors"  are more or less a distributed bank for the loan officer?

True that first world countries benefit less than other countries when using Bitcoin, but there are still many benefits. Since you specified "average American" I'll limit my response to that subset of the global population. If you aren't aware of benefits of other countries with more volatile currencies just look up Cyprus in 2013.


Why are you going USD &gt; BTC &gt; USD? The point is to go USD &gt; BTC and spend. Thus you are only charged 1% in the conversion from USD &gt; BTC, and then you buy your goods at a discount from a merchant that offers one for BTC purchases. Some merchants offer 5% for Bitcoin purchasers.


Yes you are charged tax on your GAINS. So if you gain $1,000 and are taxed $350 on it, you still made a net profit of $550.


Same goes for investing in stocks or bonds. Don't like risk, don't invest. Put your money safely in a bank and lose 2.5% guaranteed each year due to inflation. And you can still write off your losses as a tax deduction.


You also could gain a lot in a short period of time. If you don't want to worry about that risk, don't convert USD to BTC until you are ready to make a purchase. Thankfully the USD is not volatile, so this is the main reason we will be one of the last countries (assuming no economic collapse) to adopt BTC.
Outside of the direct comparison of value to USD, here is a conversation I had with another redditor that explains the benefits to a consumer: 
All that said, Bitcoin shouldn't be considered as an either/or to the USD. At this point in time Bitcoin has benefits over USD described in the link above, but the USD also has benefits right now too. They work an tandem for the purpose at hand. I believe in Bitcoin's future, but that doesn't mean I don't still use USD for most purchases today.

The news about Mt. Gox, China ban, and the IRS may have instigated large sell-offs, but really we are still just coming down from the Oct/Nov bubble. The price is decided by the market, and obviously it was overvalued at $1,200. It was obviously a bubble, and the market needs to correct itself accordingly. The slide down from the all-time high just shows that the majority of people believed the price was still too high based on the current infrastructure, news, and overall sentiment. Even if all that bad news hadn't have happened, it is likely that the price would have dropped for some other reason we'd try to correlate.
If you look at past bubbles, it follows a similar pattern where the price rose 10-30x its value, and then at the top some news caused a huge sell-off. Mt. Gox being hacked, the hard fork, etc. But many believe the drops would have occurred regardless, simply because a spike in value from $1 to $30 in such a short period of time shows that the price had become detached from the actual value (which by definition is a bubble).
But if you look at the price from a longer term perspective, it is a much more positive outlook. We look at the short-term and see a price drop from $1200 to $500. But if you step back you can see from Sept. 2013 to March 2014 the price rose from $125 to $500. A 400% return over 6 months is not too shabby.
It may continue to drop more, but eventually it will stabilize once it hits the point where more start buying because they believe it is undervalued. From there as long as more people continue to adopt Bitcoin, the price will rise accordingly. And I'd expect to see many more crashes in the future as long as it survives.

My big issue with today's NYFS hearings revolves around this statement from this article:




Regulators believe they can control a decentralized currency via regulation. Venture capitalists welcome regulations since it will help them make a large profit by making reducing competition by smaller companies that don't have millions of startup capital. But the fact is that in an international decentralized currency, every "vote" matters. If one country stifles innovation, entrepreneurs will move to another country. If the core protocol of that currency changes to benefit a segment of the market (or a central agency), the users will move to a different truly coin, one that is truly anonymous.
Regulation of fiat already exists, so governments should continue using your regulatory regime of USD, EUR, etc. But the idea of changing Bitcoin itself to meet regulatory standards is ridiculous. Banning coin mixing or "tumblers" is absurd ~~as that would be the first time a technology in itself would be banned~~. I can't believe some of the statements that came out of today's hearings. Some of the people in that room had absolutely no right to be representing the collective interests of the people.

Now we just need them to come out and say that exchanges that do not deal in fiat do not need money transmitter licenses.

Interesting you say that. Conversely, VS2010 was terrible on my PC. Incredibly slow, crashed on launch, and like you said -- buggy. But 2012 was so much better. On the same computer it was faster and while it still has some issues, it was leaps and bounds better. In fact I still had 2010 installed and every time it opened accidentally due to some file type associations, it lead to a verbal outlash while force closing it since otherwise I'd have to wait 3 min. for it to finish opening.
The awesome thing is that they have the intellisense of VS available to other editors:

It is only entrapment if the person was pushed to do something they would not have done under normal circumstances. Michelhack obviously was willing to sell bitcoin and already had "at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins". If Michelhack had no intention originally to do this and the undercover agent convinced or influenced him to suddenly go through with it maybe, but definitely not the case here.
Still, I never would've thought twice about money transmitter laws. Bitcoin is a currency..no wait it is an asset...no wait it is just nerd money. It seems the law only applies when convenient to the prosecution.

There is a part of the population that is interested in Bitcoin as either a store of value or a speculative investment, however for one reason or another they are not buying bitcoin directly right now for a variety of reasons. Lacking of technical understanding to feel safe buying themselves, lacking trust in existing exchanges, or simply not interested enough to devote a full weekend to becoming educated enough to go through the buying process. All of that is understandable at this stage. This subset of people can range from professional traders, fund managers, brokers, non-professionals that enjoy trading for fun, or anyone that has a retirement account. My father in law has mentioned multiple times wanting to buy some to see what happens, but simply does not have the technical knowledge to do so. Its just too early for someone that is not familiar with the technology to throw money at it and feel secure.
If people in this category want to put money into Bitcoin today, they have to do a ton of legwork and trust some unknown company that may go bankrupt or abscond with their funds. On top of the risk of bitcoin itself, it adds another layer of risk in trusting this new company with millions of dollars.
So then what happens if one day SecondMarket's Bitcoin Investment Trust is available directly through Vanguard, E-Trade and other existing/known/trusted platforms? And it is available through the NASDAQ, making it available to any brokerage? That opens up investments in Bitcoin to a whole new level of money, increasing the market liquidity. People that believe in the Bitcoin technology won't have to worry about private keys, cold storage, hacks, viruses, etc. They will just log in to their existing brokerage account and click "buy". This would also open up investments into Bitcoin through tax efficient accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, etc.
That amount of new capital available to the market may significantly increase the price at first since many will be looking to buy in at first. Just as the number of users/investors increased in October/November as more and more people jumped in, it would occur to a larger scale once it is available to a wider audience. And as more money is available, the market becomes more liquid which will reduce the volatility. It will also do away with some market manipulation from the larger whales since there will be a lot more orders they will have to fulfill to increase or decrease the price with a huge buy/sell order.
I know there are quite a few people that hate the idea of wall street coming into Bitcoin, but I think there is a lot to be gained from it. I would probably have more BTC in my retirement accounts if it was an option, especially with the recent IRS tax guidelines. It opens up Bitcoin to new people, new money, and the media will eat it up. And with larger, existing/trusted companies providing exchange services, we will move past the days of these startup exchanges being hacked every day, causing the market to drop at the drop of a pin.

I would keep hounding Coinbase about this. It might take a while due to the lacking support since this is an issue on their side and its not like you send a transaction to the blockchain.
I would explain the situation and see if they can re-send the email that was sent to the bad email address (that you recently created) so you can at least obtain the coins you sent. This is really akin to if you sent money to an email address and that person never received the email due to a spam filter.

Your comment about the emergency bill is a good one for the present. But if banks (or PayPal) begin to integrate bitcoin into their services, which seems more and more likely each year, at that point Western Union is going to have some real cause for concern. Once their competitors are offering significantly lower prices to undercut Western Union, they'll have no choice but to use it themselves to stay competitive.
The integration of bitcoin will benefit existing companies in nearly every market as opposed to outright fighting it. I'm sure Western Union is watching, and is just waiting until it starts having an effect on their revenues before they react.

You are correct regarding why "7 transactions per second" was selected. However note that transactions vary in size, so the "7 per second" was just a guesstimate, and has proven to not be entirely accurate since many transactions today exceed the estimated size when that limit was set.

I do think WU/banks would still have transaction costs for the convenience of instant cash-in-hand services, but the market will open up with new competition and drive those prices down. The reason banks take so long to process transactions today is due to process they use, ACH. You can read a good/simple description of why ACH takes so long [here](
If Bitcoin is used for the underlying transfer, the banks can be confident after a few confirmations that there is little-to-no risk of double spends. Which means they'll be able to offer nearly-instant transfer of money (utilizing the underlying Bitcoin network) to all of their banking customers, with immediate cash-outs. As soon as one bank starts doing this, others will start following suit. In order to compete they will have to offer lower prices, or a better value for their services. Since they aren't using ACH, they don't need as many employees to verify and manage the transactions. It can all be automated and run 24-7. Less payroll and less costs allows them to reduce prices.
Unlike Western Union or wire transfers today, people will have the *option* of using bank services, and in our example the only reason you'd want to use those services is for an emergency requiring less than four day cash-outs. If Wells Fargo is offering instant money transfers to any of their locations for $5 due to the scenario described above, nobody would have a reason to use Western Union anymore. Western Union would be forced to react if their customers started using other services that were cheaper and faster.
Of course that is all speculation, I have no idea what banks are currently thinking or how it would actually play out.

Here are the advantages to a consumer for every day purchases:
Push, not pull: Bitcoin is a method of "push" payments instead of "pull". With credit cards you are trusting that the party you provide your CC number to will keep it safe and secure, and will not try to charge you for more than you agreed. The merchant "pulls" the money from your account. With Bitcoin you decide when and how much to pay rather than the merchant, and "push" it to them. You are in control of your own money (what a concept!).
Security: You don't have to worry about attacks like the data compromise that occurred with Target recently. No more worrying about waiting for a bank to re-issue you a new card and that you may be victim to identity theft due to a company not updating their servers to fix a known exploit. Since Bitcoin doesn't require personal information, nothing is out there to be stolen.
Privacy: porn subscriptions are a great example here. You don't have to worry about explaining what that $39.99 charge was on your bank statement to others on the account. Sure they use a generic name, but any time I see a purchase on my statement with my SO that I don't recognize, I'm going to question if it was a fraudulent purchase. It has happened before where her card was stolen and was used to buy some products online, and she never would've caught it except I raised a flag when doing our finances.
Convenience: how many times have you wanted to buy food or a drink and the vendor only accepts cash? Why do they only accept cash? Because it costs them too much to accept credit card (the 3-4% fees eat their small margins too much). With the minimal miner fees of Bitcoin that is no longer a concern...any vendor with a cell phone or even a printed QR code could accept your bitcoin payment.
Accessibility: how many times have you been out for dinner or drinks, and someone pays the tab and you say "how much do I owe you? [pull out wallet] oh sorry I don't have any cash on me. I'll pay you back once I can get to an ATM." I've paid family/friends in BTC multiple times now in these exact situations.
Hope those give you some ideas of why it is beneficial for the average consumer that isn't sending money overseas.

Fells Point is a great afternoon trip.  Traffic isn't too bad in that area since there are tons of cross streets. If you use I-95 it is pretty easy to get in and out though that is coming from someone that does it regularly. The bar with the ATM (Bad Decisions) is separate from the main strip, so there is street parking available.  I can usually find a spot within 2 blocks of the bar.

As is repeated over and over: the Bitcoin network doesn't care who connects to it, and relies on being trustless. Innovate, adapt, and fix the problems now and we'll be ready when Bitcoin becomes an even larger threat to those with billions of dollars vested to prevent disruption of their entire industry.

Without a monetary token of incentive, how do you prevent a 51% attack while keeping the ledger decentralized? Even if IBM has its own blockchain, the only way to secure the chain is to prevent a 51% attack with enough computational power. Plenty of altcoins have failed due to not having a secure enough network (Auroracoin for example).

Plus, as a result of higher prices for imports on things like electronics (which businesses of course use to operate), local retailers and merchants have to increase their prices to remain profitable. Which can lead to higher consumer prices over the long term.

Agreed, much better word for it.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:15:48
Then instead of using a blockchain, why not just use a database that is publicly readable to everyone, and uses a chain of hashes to verify previous records were not changed? It seems to defeat the purpose of a blockchain if a central entity controls the flow of information. It seems like it is forcing a square peg in a round hole at that point. If the Federal Reserve published it's records every year, that would be "open centralized" without a blockchain and probably would be much more efficient.

Agreed. Each time one of the underground illegal marketplaces gets busted it further proves that Bitcoin is not anonymous, and it is easier to get caught than using cash. This will be further evidence in debates of "well criminals can do X anonymously with Bitcoin" to which the rebuttal is a list of every criminal that has been apprehended.

The thought of Bitcoin being created by the NSA is the scariest thought ever conceived. And they have a hidden backdoor in the cryptography itself so even though it is open source the backdoor isn't apparent. 
I probably won't sleep for a week now, thanks!

A well written and unbiased article. I like that they focused more on the utility of Bitcoin rather than solely on the volatility and regurgitation of skepticism found in a lot of other articles.
Of course the comments are about par, but one step at a time...

Circle is pretty well anticipated because of their team (ever better now), their funding ($9m in seed funding), forward-focused compliance with FinCEN and their focus of making it easier for general user adoption. Here is a great interview:  Allaire was part of the Senate hearings in November.
Unfortunately not too much is known about what products they will be releasing, though there are some rumors of them being a "Bitcoin Bank":
Personally I'm really looking forward to their product launches. Their plans are very thought out and not just a "let's throw together an exchange in 3000 lines of code and hope I don't get shut down next week".
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:11:41
"Tie guy" is [Tom Keene]( He had his mind made up about Bitcoin before he ever understood it (watch the first video of 12 days of Bitcoin where he asks if it is a physical coin, though had already had multiple comments about it being a scam). I've never seen him say a single positive thing about Bitcoin. He's entitled to his opinion of course, but is very close minded about it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:45:54
He could sell half now, and hold half for the long-term. That way if it goes to $10k/BTC he'll be happy about the gain, and if it drops to $100/BTC he'll be happy about cashing out during its peak.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:54:52
I wonder why this occurs...is it due to higher confidence in the currency? Seems like there is a psychological explanation for it. 
And FTR I do the same thing (though I always buy back the same amount of coins I spend).

gave a great response, but to add:
1. 
2. 
3. (see 
4. Apple is not a great platform for Bitcoin developers due to their strict terms and conditions. They don't allow apps to transfer money without using Apple's API, which restricts what the app can do. That is likely why Coinbase was removed from the app store. Blockchain.info does have an app although it is limited in features. Worth a try though (I'm an Android user).
5. If you enter your wallets as "watch only" in Blockchain.info it will keep track of each address' worth, as well as a running grand total in USD.
If you are just getting started, my one suggestion is to PRACTICE sending small amounts of coins to yourself. You will have to pay transactions fees on the small transfers (anything less than .01 BTC has a mandatory fee). But it is well worth spending a dollar or two while learning how to create/store wallets, than realizing 10 years down the road that you did things wrong and your 1000 BTC have been lost. Start with bitaddress.org and just play around generating some addresses, and re-entering the private keys in the "Wallet Details" to see how it all fits together.
Also refer to  to get a good walkthrough of how it works, and a few cents worth of bitcoins for free. 
Welcome and good luck!

Anyone that is expecting to shop on Black Friday should purchase their budgeted amount in Bitcoins with the intention of buying on that day. Plan on buying $100 worth of goods? Buy that amount in coins and spend them! That way you don't lose any of your investment portfolio, and you are also supporting the cause.
I'm waiting for my transactions to clear just to buy a Bitcoin t-shirt (it's the simple things).

This was the first time I've seen an in-depth review of the potentials of the Bitcoin outside of the transfer of money (such as a decentralized stock exchange).

True...the more I read about the instances where this is occurring, and news of the upcoming iWallet, I am seeing it more in line with your two points. It seems like their blanket statements with app removals (not only in this instance) could indeed be a way to manipulate app availability without running into antitrust problems. And I imagine they'll always be able to get away with that since Bitcoin isn't being declared "legal" or "illegal" by most countries. Though I wonder if releasing their iWallet functionality will raise more suspicions and allegations of antitrust if they continue to bump Bitcoin apps.
Apple's lawyers win this time.

Did you have 2-factor authentication set on your account? That is rule  when it comes to securing your account.
Coinbase isn't going to be able to do anything here. It is unlikely your coins were accessed via any intrusion on their side. It sucks, but coins you can't afford to lose should be put in cold storage.

Transaction fees are required when sending less than 0.01 BTC ("dust spam"). Small transactions like this are discouraged since otherwise someone could send a million different transaction of 0.000001 BTC which would put a lot of strain on the network. 
One day after all of the coins are mined, the fees will be the only incentive for miners to continue processing transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:09:23

Coinbase also provides merchant tools that convert the bitcoin to USD similar to BitPay. Coinbase's checkout interface is pretty intuitive (much like the rest of their site) and guides the user through the process easily. I hate to compare to PayPal, but it reminds me of their interface of "Pay using PayPal", "Sign up for PayPal" or "Pay using Credit Card". These are the types of improvements that will allow for a more widespread consumer adoption of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:19:48
That is a really good point. PayPal's systems already exist, are secure, and have mainstream trust. Those are the perfect aspects for an online Bitcoin wallet. And like their existing model, you would just keep your coins in PayPal until you want to transfer them out (at which point you would incur a fee). Its really the exact same PayPal only with a different currency.
And all that means is more widespread adoption for Bitcoin.

I actually go on Facebook and scroll down at least 10 pages each day, and search for "bitcoin". I've said to some close friends that once I see my peers posting about Bitcoin, it means it is hitting the mainstream in my peer group (semi-jokingly, I accept it as my own truth).
There have been 2 posts in the past month linking to articles about it. No discussion under those posts from anyone, and no "likes" the articles. I see it as a matter of mass adoption. Bitcoin is still a long way from the average person showing any interest in it. Right now it is technophiles, investors, and hopeful futurists. Casual users on FB aren't going to talk about it until it is affecting their personal lives. Even then, you don't see people posting on Facebook about the bullish stock market or the price of gold.
Just my two satoshis.

As much as I hate their policy, you are correct. Developers are fully aware of their terms of service (I am a mobile developer) and we consciously make the choice to implement features that are in that "gray area". Unfortunately Apple is notorious for not having clear reasons for rejecting apps. So we commonly take a gamble with some of these features hoping it will go under the radar.
So this is less a story about Apple hating Bitcoin, but simply that the Coinbase app (or any app allowing purchases within an application) does not meet their terms of service due to the ability to purchase outside of their payment system.

The version of the compiled Android wallet app developed by Blockchain.info is a later version than what exists in their source code repository. Having the source code to an app being open source ensures that a company doesn't have any malicious code in it -- particularly something that could be collecting you private keys and sending them back to a server.
Since the newest app version available is newer than the one that is in their code repo, users can't be sure this malicious code doesn't exist.
Very likely just a mistake where one of the developers didn't push their changes before uploading it to the app store, but its great that people like are actively keeping tabs on it.

I agree. And in a patent you can only claim rights on the advances you make, so any existing aspects like virtual currencies that are filed by other patents can't be enforced by JPMorgan. I think it would be a huge stretch to uphold a claim that Bitcoin exchanges or developers were in violation of portions of this patent due to those wide variances.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:50:56

You are correct: transaction cap is [7 per second]( It is an intentional limit until the network can handle it.

Very interesting. It sounds like a promising solution plaguing a lot of users that aren't familiar with the security procedures to protecting your coins, as well as the rest of us that don't want to continue to rely on untested hot wallet/exchange services.
I wasn't too familiar with Open Transactions so I did a bit of looking around for others that are also interested:


* [Open Transactions Wiki Page](
* [How Can Open Transactions Benefit Bitcoin](
* [What Is Open-Transactions](
* [GitHub Source](
It really sounds like this is the layer atop of the Bitcoin protocol that was intended to occur organically by service providers as Bitcoin matured.

I run a small client-based business that accepts Bitcoin as a method of payment. We even offer a small discount if paid in Bitcoin prior to the due date. Our invoices are sent out in USD, but we have a link to a payment page where they can pay via Bitcoin. Since we use Coinbase's merchant tools, the Bitcoin is converted instantly into USD. There is no risk for either us or our clients, and we are helping promote the use of Bitcoin.
If your contract is requiring payment in Bitcoin, it really should account for market fluctuations, as should your accounts receivable process. I think this is less of a problem with Bitcoin as it is with your contract's terms and conditions. Your attorney and accountant should have some advice on structuring payments this way, and how to handle the volatility without additional risk to either you or your client.
Regarding the argument of "nobody wanting to use them" hurting the value, [check out this interview with the BTC China CEO]( regarding value (link jumps to 4:30 but watch the whole video when you have time).
I definitely feel your pain in losing a contract due to something like a market fluctuation, but as you know in business you just have to learn from the experience. Make your terms more flexible in the future and hopefully it will be a better experience.

The point is to build merchant confidence in Bitcoin. If a merchant participates in Bitcoin Black Friday and only has 1 Bitcoin sale, they might not think the ROI of integrating Bitcoin is worth it at this time. However if they generate more revenue from Bitcoin than expected, they will continue to support the protocol.
Anyone here can be considered an early adopter, which means making sacrifices and dealing with inconveniences as a consumer and investor. But if you believe in the principles of Bitcoin, then it is well worth it for the long-term gains.
