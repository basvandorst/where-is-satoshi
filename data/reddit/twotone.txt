It only allows partial network security.  I like as much security as possible  Sure, the fact that I have to go through the whole validation process is annoying, but it's really nothing.

Red Hat's business model has the potential for a lot more clients than what embedded can.  They also started with a good bit of cash making it a lot easier to push it, something I don't have.


That requires hiring people who'd be able to maintain it and provide support.


That's stupidly hard.  I'd have to hire a certified security expert as there is no way in hell I could do that and it be marketable.  Security isn't cheap nor is it easy.


That requires hiring skilled linux admins to work as support.
My point is that this isn't cheap.  Even starting small requires tens of thousands of dollars, something I don't make in a year.  Red Hat started out with money because Bob Young had already been running other business from before ACC/Red Hat.

One word: Support.
I know of no commercially available distros that specialize in embedded Linux that offer commercial support.  Hmm, I smell a business opportunity.

You know, you should have just said this first instead just saying 




Well, from my point of view from earlier it was new news, so to me it was possible that I was.  Someone had to have been and if this had been new news, it could have been me.
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:59:28
IRC and forums do ***NOT*** equal commercial support, in any way, shape, or form.
IRC "support" is a crap shot, you never know if someone will help you, if any one remotely knows of a way to fix your problem, most offered help won't actually fix anything (might even make shit worse), no one is obligated in any way to help you, and it could very well likely take several hours to actually find a solution let alone the time it takes to fix it.  Downtime kills, be it servers or embedded systems like ATMs.
Compare that to the support available to RHEL users who can just call up support at any time of the day, 365 days out of the year;  Their support ninjas know their distro inside and out, and will be able to fix any issue in a matter of a couple hours, if not less than an hour; And to top it off they are obligated by contract to make sure your shit is 100% right again.
IRC and forums are good for power users who don't mind getting their terminal dirty, it is not in any way an option for commercial enterprises.
E:  The more and more I think about this the more and more I wish I had the money to start something like this. It would be expensive and very risky but could very well be very profitable.

It's an old /b/ joke/reference.  Some /b/tard had highjacked some woman's MySpace account and started posting her shit on /b/. When she became aware of this, she went to 4chan in an attempt to have them taken down. After threatening to involve the authorities, she was met with the response: “I WENT THROUGH 7 PROXIES GOOD LUCK". 
It was a decently epic thread.

All of the ones that allow full network security have a *LONG* set up time.  Also, bitcoin-qt is also known as "Bitcoin Core" and acts as the standard for all other wallets.
I also like QT because QT (the lib) allows the gui to fit in with the native theme.
