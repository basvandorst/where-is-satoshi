You use Ethereum when the network is congested.

Everything happens faster in crypto is the golden rule to remember. Merchants need to be ready for a fast volatile market instead of today's slow volatile market. Gas stations and supermarkets has been ready for a long time already by switching over to digital price tags for instance.
Another thing to remember is to see everything from a bigger perspective. While crypto may crash multiple times per year it recovers within days/hours. Fiat crash with a few years in between but the consequences are often disastrous due to the longer recovery time.

That doesn't mean a fair trial, the CC company becomes both the judge and the jury and it's still evidence based. How are you as a customer gonna prove that the item was destroyed before you opened the package and how are you as a merchant gonna prove that you did send the package but either the postal service lost it or the customer received it but are hiding it to get both the item and the money.


Honest people wont try to stop their transaction and honest merchants will refund you. Dishonest customers won't pay more than the price of the item just to stop the transaction and dishonest merchants will loose their customers and disappear very soon. You don't need a dispute process under those circumstances.

Well isn't that the establishment logic? it's not only in the ghetto cars are on fire, it's in the whole country. It's not only Muslims who commit crimes and rape in Sweden, it's all men... and so on. Don't you remember? I think he's just trying not to be a racist by your own definition. You should have thought of this earlier before insurance fraud, revenge, hate towards Sweden etc caused so many car fires.

Depends if you make it a problem or not. Too many transactions flooding the network is a problem. But not the fees, you can always adjust them depending on how fast you want your transaction to clear.

Still, the market repaired itself before WW3 broke out.

Post WW1 Germany had a currency with government regulation, what did the government do to save the economy? Actually most wars after the invention of fiat currency has been related to money somehow. There where wars before fiat too but for other reasons.

A customer who pays with credit card can initiate a chargeback up to 120 days after the purchase was made, without any technical knowledge. Besides, nobody would pay $20 in transaction fees to steal something worth less than $20.

Doesn't matter, people do bad things when they think they're anonymous. Usually chargebacks occurs with items that has to be shipped where the fraudulent customer says they didn't received the item even if they did but you as a merchant cannot prove it.

When the blocksize becomes big enough their blockchain will be too big to fit in a NAS, desktop PC or home server. That leaves no other options than to store the chain in a centralized cloud.

I hardly doubt that, not even the scamcoin beconnect have crashed to zero yet.

Banks could convert into exchanges and earn a lot of money on people trading between crypto and fiat. They also have debit card agreements in place and other services connected to the old monetary system so if they added support for cryptocurrencies too most customers would stay with them.
