The daily market is 1-2 billion. To those that think there won't be collusion between whales in the futures market, or that these firms can't pool their capital: Competition is a sin. - Rockefeller
Believing that the US government will regulate these firms only shows ignorance of who runs the government, and neglects the vested interest the USFG has in maintaining USD fiat supremacy.

If a loan is delinquent it can be classified in various ways. The bar chart shows "90+days". So there are loans that are delinquent that do not qualify to be included in the "90+day" category, chart authors assume double. For example I may have missed my last two payments. What would support the 2x claim is a rate of delinquency chart. comprende?

Disagreement here seems to center around timing. The BTC hodler is a long term position, while every trader thinks in tiny increments. Traders tend to see a BUY signal when everyone else is frantic so they can jump on for a brief ride. They dgaf what happens after they close the position.

When measuring trading volume, LN capability and any related metrics surrounding amount of BTC being transacted across the entire network: how are intermediary transactions treated in the calculation? For example, if I have a 100 sat wallet and spend 25 there are two transactions at minimum right? Aa spend (25sat) and return (75sat). When reporting volume transacted, would it be the full 100sat? Same thing with lightning, how does the calculation of transaction volume go about?

One clarification question on this point: if a business wants to adopt BTC as a payment, the concern of volatility is paramount. Is there a threshold for which BTC transaction value must reach before the business can utilize futures as a hedge?  Are there any business services that offer this to clients?

I'll be pleased to see those that have been in the space for a long time leverage their gains against the presumably out of touch futures market. If the adoption rate continues the future price is outrageous and any position would be very risky. Imagine 10x or 100x leveraging. I'd be entertained by institutional nay-sayers put their yachts where their pie holes are.

I think your should pursue this idea. Anything to lower the threshold to entry is good in my view. Brainstorming:

just some ideas. good luck

A similar price movement with gold that is explained as a flight of capital from other asset classes. BTC has similarities to gold and may also be utilized as a safe haven in bear markets.
