Every roulette spin is independent of the prior spin so its always the same % chance of hitting red or black or some number.  The purposely display prior roulette spins to fool people into thinking about probability and getting more suckers to bet on red/black.  A casino is not going to give you an advantage like that.

Each candle stick is a representation of a unit of time and shows how much the price went up or went down in the unit of time.  Red is decrease and Green is increase.
So for example in that graph each candlestick could represent an hour and you can see hour by hour how much it is increasing or decreasing.

I think its because it's taking so long to transfer bitcoin to and from exchanges that no one is able to benefit from the price gap.  I would think normally they would be relatively close because people would be buying and selling quickly between exchanges to catch the profit and thus they would eventually equalize.

Perhaps I don't understand Futures well enough but in simple terms isn't it just a Contract to buy BitCoin at a guaranteed price from a Seller?  
How would this decrease the value of BitCoin?  Who would sign a contract to sell Bitcoin as a lower price?  If anything I would think it would just provide further stabilization as it now provides Buyers and Sellers a mechanism to shield themselves from the crazy price fluctuations.

You can buy and sell on the gdax exchange directly which is owned by coinbase with very little fees.  You can also put a sell order for as many btc as you want on the exchange though it'll take a while to sell them all and you probably won't find a single buyer for 1,000 coins at a single price.

If I borrow a Future Contract and Sell for 18,500 and price drops to 10,000 I would buy it back at 10,000 netting a 8,500 profit.  I'm not going to sell my bitcoin that I bought.  Sure if you sell you bitcoin at 10,000 you would net 2,500 but then you would be dumb to do that.

The normal recommendation for starting out is 30k but I would say you really need closer to 100k.  You have to be able to leverage a large principle so that you don't get eaten alive by trading fees.  It's  like playing blackjack but you also have to pay a fee every time you want to enter and exit a hand.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:41:48
If it was a Roth 5 years invested than I would say go for it.  But in this case probably not smart.  You would need the price of btc to almost double for you to recoup your original 12k after penalties.  You are better off reinvesting in some risky stocks if you feel like gambling.

The US cracked down on US exchanges pretty hard and prosecuted people unfairly to send a message.  Some of these people such as [Charlie Shrem]( didn't even knowingly participate but were still convicted even though banks and investment firms have been caught for doing the same even more blatantly with just a fine.

Coinbase is what convinced me Bitcoin was here to stay.  Every person I have shown the app to has downloaded it and bought some btc. Versus back in 2010/11 when I told coworkers about Bitcoin and only 1 person out of probably 50 actually was hyped about it.

If you are a futures trader you can double dip.
Basically run up bitcoin a for few days buy buying large quantities inducing FOMO and at the same time short some future contracts.  Then sell all your bitcoin at once for a profit trying to force a market panic so you can profit on your future shorts.  The risk is if another whale calls your bluff you are toast.

Bitcoin isn't waiting on some technological breakthrough for it to be viable for the masses like your example of the internet or even the personal computer to add another.  It's currently ready for use and very few are using it for its intended purpose.

I'm looking to avoid paying capital gains tax.   If I can keep the money in a Roth I don't have to pay them.

GOOD MORNING CHINA!  Nothing happened while you were sleeping I promise.

Not a Good Friday.

Which Exchange?  Most have an API such as GDAX that will at the very least provide you with filled orders data.  The P&amp;L analysis is pretty straightforward if you have that.

Giving a bot that you personally didn't program access to your trading account is beyond retarded.

I personally think 5,900 as the low is generous.  I think we are going much lower unless moby dick shows up.

It's already dropped 10% on rumors.  What % do you think it will drop then if it's confirmed to be an Binance security issue?  It certainly won't go up.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:44:09
Good Discussion.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:41:54
I'm just trying to figure out the truth with the information that currently exists.  I have a good stake in BTC and I'm currently trying to make a determination whether or not I want to exit the Market for a day or two while this story resolves itself.
It does us as a community no good to dismiss any information just because it may not benefit us. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:08:22
Might be able to find a Lambo kit.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:47:04
If you are looking to get back in than you should just wait for it to level off or gain some momentum for a day or two.  It's pure luck buying the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:28:44
This sounds like the Chinese New Year's and Wall Street bonus line.

So I should probably use this credit card to buy bitcoin.

? Explain
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:02:28
The rise back to 9,000 was nothing but pumps the whole way.  Very little volume and organic growth in between the pumps.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:59:57
You are hyper focusing on brick and mortar retail which has been pretty much dismantled by Amazon.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:51:57
Today is different.  There are rumors circulating that the Binance API has been compromised.  That is Mt. Gox level crashing if true.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:11:39
Are there not rumors circulating that the Binance API was compromised?  Did I not state a fact?  
Or are you referring to the Mt. Gox statement?
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:40:42
Binance db resync is taking so long because they are located on the moon.  A very forward thinking company.

Anybody with the internet and a brain can see that investing in altcoins isn't going to yield better results.  You are probably worse off right now if you are in alts.

What he is actually trying to say is HODL.

The framework does it for you.

The fees will add up.  Better off doing it manually on Gdax.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:21:03
You can setup a Limit Price as an additional option on GDAX.  So if you set it at 10,400 than it won't execute if it's $10,500

You bought a paper weight.

Penny Stocks don't have thousands of open source developers investing their time and knowledge to make the technology better.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:13:22
According to this thread that doesn't seem to be the case.  We still don't know the truth.
Edit: Found another one

You receive a Lambo as a dividend.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:40:07
What about lambos?
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:50:14
That's a good amount to invest in btc because it succeeds 41 and precedes 43
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:52:23
You could argue the alternative.

Looks like it could go either way at this moment.  Going to market sell and put in a stop loss buy order.  Buy High Sell Low!

Goolag at it again.

Doesn't prevent the buyer from selling btc on the market once they have acquired it.

The rise to 20k and fall to where we are now made no sense either.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:09:27
From what I recall the future markets where you can short are already cash settled so no actual bitcoins are exchanged.
For Example:

Are you speculating or is this what happened?  And I don't really understand the significance of losing a copy of your DB.  Wouldn't think it would take long to resynchronize.

Not entirely true.  If less people mine the difficulty drops and it requires less energy to yield the same results.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:06:33
Because I'm buying the dips.

Get those Vegeta meme's ready.

It means that you may not get the price set as your stop.  If there is a sudden surge in price it'll probably buy higher than 9,600.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:29:08
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:18:02
Sure you did.  I'm also sure you have some brilliant reason why you didn't sell when it hit 8k the first time.

I'm buying the dip.  WITNESS ME!

I hope at the very least the one lesson everyone learns from this is that shit coins do not provide you diversification in case bitcoin crashes.
