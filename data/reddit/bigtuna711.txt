Wow, they are either stupid or have some agenda.

Just to explain for anyone who doesn't understand, they should show the percentage yield to be accurately compared.

Thanks for the explanation, that makes sense.

Ya, that's a good point.  Would treating bitcoin as a currency rather than as a commodity be better?

Just hit $740 on GDAX!

Ya, your right, thanks.  You would still pay 30% on all the bitcoin you sold.  It would just be annoying to have to sell additional bitcoin for each of your bitcoin transactions.  If bitcoin could just be used to pay taxes, things would be easier.

Interesting, I was under the assumption that any gain in value between buying and selling (or trading) of a commodity was subject to capital gains tax.

Ya, I not worried about anything, it's just a thought experiment.  I was just researching bitcoin taxes and I starting thinking about a situation where someone had all their money in BTC.  So take the edge case of moving 100% of your net worth from BTC to buying a house.  How would you pay capital gains tax on that BTC used in the transaction?  Would the government force you to sell your house to pay?

Just replace "Buy gold and silver" in the video with "Buy bitcoin".

3Blue1Brown has over 250k subscribers, so hopefully it gets some more technical minds interested in bitcoin. He also has some other great math videos as well, check them out.
