Have you ever been to a public school? I can't call that useful in good conscience.

I'd like sources on that.
You know what history has shown us? That when handed the power to tax and start wars, some people will use that power.

You already pay for all of that. It's called "taxes".

So, if they don't want to pay for the things you think they should pay for, they deserve to be thrown in a cage.
1. Right, but they don't threaten people. If we have to threaten people to get them to pay for the services that they want, how do businesses stay in business? I was never threatened by Sunkist (I don't know who made it, I'm just saying the name on the can) yet I am enjoying one of their sodas. How is this possible?
2. Other people seem to have gotten a pretty good grasp on this sort of thing. Every business out there has to deal with this. Regardless, why are you punishing other people for this? Isn't that your problem to deal with?

Irrelevant. Entirely irrelevant. Whether or not you benefit from something doesn't mean anything. If you benefit from something in a sort of "Roads help get things places!" that doesn't mean you have to directly pay for it. That's ridiculous. If the roads were private then people would pay a sort of toll (I can't really imagine what the market would come up with, but you get my drift) and that would include for shipping goods. This would simply be added into the price of the things you buy. You would pay for it anyway.


See above.


I don't know, but there are tons of different ways they *could* be handled.
What I think will happen is that there'll be a sort of blacklist for these types of people. I could imagine stores paying a company to keep lists of these people, most likely with pictures or some way of identifying them. They would then refuse service to these sorts of people. At this point I imagine they would have options. They could choose to go to a private prison, hopefully to be reformed (I don't know enough about psychology to tell you exactly how this would be done, but it couldn't be too unpleasant or no one would pay for it). This would then be made note of and they'd be removed from the blacklist (maybe a small note indicating they had a prior offense that was remedied, just in case they commit an offense again). Or they could not go and simply rely on the generosity of friends and families.
I'm not entirely sure, though. People could come up with other ways of handling this sort of thing, maybe better ones.

Alright, let's sum this up.
* Most people want the things taxes pay for.
* Most people benefit from the things taxes pay for.
* A minority of people do not want the things taxes pay for.
* If we do not threaten to throw people in prison, no one will pay the (I'm calling it something else) subscription fee for those things that they want.
Did I get all that?
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:52:58
So, are you saying no one wants those things?
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:38:19
At this point you'd probably have to pay someone to take it.

1. Doesn't this simply demonstrate that the threats are ineffective and the "owners" of the music should find better ways of either securing or monetizing their service? On top of that, you still haven't explained how it is the people who make Sunkist are still in business without threatening everyone to buy Sunkist.
2. It doesn't follow that we then make everyone pay for them. That's a total leap. I'm sorry that roads are subject to the same forces *every company* is subject to. Thing is, that's life. Sorry for your bad luck. That doesn't mean you get to take what you want to fund the roads people may or may not want. These services shouldn't be treated as special. Unless, of course, you are for taxing 100% of everything and everything is just kind of laying around for people to grab. That'd at least be consistent.

I want to make this absolutely clear.
You believe people will not pay for things they want unless you threaten them.
Two things.
1. How do businesses stay in business?
2. Why don't you just not charge them and then not let them use those services?
