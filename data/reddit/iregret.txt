I want to do this, but I also want to wait until after Coinbase gives me my bitcoin cash.

I wish coinbase would give me my bitcoin cash.

While I'm attached to my username, I'd probably let it go for 26.03 BTC. LMAO.
If it makes you feel any better, I once had 5 BTC and gave them all away. It was my version of reddit gold.

Awesome. I wonder how many folks had similar experiences? I gave away quite a bit on r/millionairemakers. I even tipped a guy through text message from a craigslist transaction. Lol. I just wish I would have taken it a bit more seriously, that's all.

Has r/Bitcoin always been this political or is it just the environment post trump that makes everyone a bit political?

At least you had a good time!

I’m just using NiceHash’s wallet because of low transfer fees. Is this a bad idea? Should I be transferring to Coinbase? My thought was mine until I have about 1 bitcoin, then transfer to Coinbase. So, this is something that rarely happens.

People keep saying this, but is there any chance that it is possible for them to get that high? It seems more likely to me that the value will go the other way...

Thanks for the detailed response. Seriously. I'm getting into mining, mostly for fun, but I'll just hold my bitcoin earnings. Maybe one day they'll be über valuable!
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:53:41
That's awesome.

The easiest way is nicehash.com.
