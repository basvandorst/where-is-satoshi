A nonce is pretty important, especially if the you're dealing with money! It ensures that requests are executed in the correct order and also prevents you from loosing your money if your application somehow ends up retrying the same request multiple times (network delays, DDOS, heavy load,..).
To fix your proplem it's usually enough to let each thread wait for a second after sending a request.
If you need more than 1-2 api calls per second, you have to use a timestamp with higher precision. If I remember correctly *process.hrtime()* should do the trick.
    function nonce() {
        var t = process.hrtime();
        return 1000000*t[0] + t[1]/1000;
    }

Welcome! a few tips:
* Forget about mining, the difficulty is just too insanely high and it's going to skyrocket alot more.
* Don't trust anyone (people &amp; websites), it's kind of sad but there are still ALOT scammers in bitcoin land.
* Don't believe everything you read (&gt;50% is manipulative talk).
* Use 2FA and secure passwords (&gt;10 chars) and never use it twice, even if it's annoying (Protip: [Keepass](
* Store most of your coins offline (paper wallets) and use a secure hot wallet (Protip: [Blockchain.info Plugin](
* 2 weeks are never 2 weeks (aka. Don't buy anything from BFL).
* Most important: Keep calm and DON'T PANIC (aka. sell high, buy low).
I found out about bitcoin in 2011, mined some coins with my CPU but thought it wasn't worth it so I deleted everything (**DOH!**).
Anyway, because I found it awesome and saw a huge potential in it, I kept watching it and as we hit $30 I got a strange feeling so I started buying and at $70 I went almost all-in.
Then suddently shit got *totally crazy* and I didn't get much sleep since... I won't tell the whole story because it's tl;dr so let's just say I survived the insane rollercoaster pretty well.
I'm now daytrading and playing with algorithm trading (bots) but I won't touch most of my coins in the next 1-2 years since I still have this feeling and I think we're still at the beginning and bitcoin will maybe replace paypal one day.
Whatever will happen, looking at all the fun I had and things I learned during this year, it was totally worth it and I'm just happy to be a part of this.
I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do!

I don't use Amory but it looks like you're using a key chain.
The root key and chain code can be used to calculate many "linked" bitcoin addresses.
You said you send your funds to the same address which should be one of the addresses in the key chain.
To recover your funds you have to enter your root key + chain code on the site mentioned which will generate a list of your addresses and their private key.
In order to spend the funds you have to import the private key of the address you used.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:31:31
Address != Private Key
There are various formats/encodings of addresses and keys, to get a good overview of them, go to [bitaddress]( click on "Wallet Details" and enter the following "mini key": SxCPzj6z4gAdznkAYHihA5TfjfKHcF

Yes but as almost anywhere in bitcoin you have to look at it differently.
Your numbers are true today, but since they take fees in USD and BTC, all of their commissions on buy orders below $120 are now worth more.
Also the average daily volume during the march bubble was 100.000 on the up and 200.000 on the down, peaking at 500.000 on April 12. Given the exchange rate back then and the fact they're still lagging, I think it's save to assume they made ALOT of money and didn't spend much of it on infrastructure... 
Also, those $2.9m are not gone (yet), they're just frozen.

maybe i should have used 10k for nr. 1 ;) anyway the trick with nr 2. is that you don't just buy everything at once, instead you "pump" the price up in multiple steps. if you buy a few hundred coins trades every 1$ or so, it looks to the other (mostly new) traders like there is a rally going on, so they might join you and push the price even further (i think some people call this "bull traps").

Well they'd need to breach TOR first to get the current location of the server. Anyway I don't think the server location is of any value. DPR isn't stupid and as we know: *smart people don't shit where they live*. I bet he's using virtual cloud servers (with encrypted ram disks) and once per month he's moving them to another cloud provider. So even if they get the location and a search warrant for the datacenter, they'd have to shut down the server and all data is lost forever (well, they could freeze it with some liquid nitrogen before shutting it down but data would still be encrypted).
That's kind of how TPB is doing it and all of the above stuff combined with the power of Bitcoin..

I suggest we all keep using Bitcoins.. They are not awesome just because they are new, they are so awesome because our genious Satoshi spend ALOT of time thinking about their design until he finally came up with an almost perfect configuration and that's why most people believe Satoshi is a group of people; It's almost impossible for a single person to understand every aspect of Bitcoin because you would need to be an expert in cryptography, money, markets, p2p networks and alot of other stuff. The only other coins which would make sense would be something like Namecoin because it is build on top of the original Bitcoin and they can be mined together (it brings also the domain stuff as a little extra feature). All the other stuff is monopoly money, mostly designed out of greed by some random developers which are just messing arround with Satoshi's perfect configuration values. In fact they are a threat to the real Bitcoin because if they ever get popular miners will start to switch between mining Altcoins and BTC, which could cause a osciliation of the distributed hashrate.
@_date: 2013-04-21 06:58:53
that's the point, they didn't steal but they "loaned" all affected users coins. the question is: how many? and where did they came from? let's say coinbase (*CB*) got 2 users: User *A* and User *B*, both owner of *100 BTC*. *CB* stores their coins in a shared wallet (*200 BTC*). Now, because of a bug User *A* was able to spend *125 BTC* and as a result *CB* changed his account balance to *-25 BTC*. This may seem like a good idea but the problem is: *CB* would now have only *75 BTC* in the shared wallet. What happens if a few days later User *B* decides to withdraw all his *200 coins*? Think about it.

well it's hard to tell without knowing the code that generates the compromised part of the website but a possible attack vector could be the title or url of the news article, so if you scrape the news of another page they might have changed that page to contain the code in the news article.
However this does not explain the uploads but if the script for uploading avatars is flawed it might be possible to trick it into accepting a file as image or worse executing code embeded in an image.
You might also check your access.log for strange urls and/or injection points.

Software and stuff would be no problem, I'm a developer myself and I also know some high skilled people which would like to join the party.

I never lost a single satoshi, it's just my sense of security.
I watched pirate run away with alot of peoples money and I saw hundreds of people buying pre orders from BFL for crazy prices even after it was common knowledge that they didn't ship anything yet and they won't make back their investment.
I also saw mining pools loosing hundreds of coins because someone hacked their servers and altered their payout code.
Common sense is just not enough if you deal with larger amounts of bitcoins.

well just to clear things up, it worked quite well for me as an indicator for future trend change and it makes quite sense too, even if there are "fake" walls and such. let's say the price is going up and at some point the rate starts to go down. this means that people are either started selling moar (there is more BTC in the marked you can buy) or people are canceling their buy orders and/or think the price is to high (there's less USD in the market). in both cases it's somehow logical that if the rate keeps going down for some time the price will start to follow at some point. if there are alot of "fake walls" the rate will still keep changing but the price stays the same, anyway at some point it seems to hit a "critical mass" and that seems to be the point when people/bots start jumping on the train.

still, difficulty was at 256 (now it is at 637844) and the first blocks (block reward: 2482 coins (now: 353)) where mined each 30-60 seconds, so if they turned their mining rig on it and flipped the switch just after the release they could mine alot of coins until other people managed to configure their rigs to mine it, too.

Smells like some tasty coverup to me. Yesterday there was a post on reddit about a bug which allowed users to withdraw too many coins. Coinbase "fixed" it by setting their users account balance to a negative value.

because i was there when satoshi was still developing and guys used to spend 10k BTC to buy pizza and i'm still not rich (because no one knew bitcoin would grow like this, so we spend thousands of coins for useless stuff). i'm not against making profit with usefull services but ripple is not usefull because it's centralized so it has nothing to do with bitcoin more then that it takes your BTC and gives you debt and it's aggressively advertised in bitcoin boards..

Ya but be careful with that, truecrypt is doing on the fly encryption which can lead to corrupted containers/partitions/files on certain conditions like power outages and such. Happened to me twice.
You should always create an additional paper backup of your keys (for example put all keys in a txt file, encrypt it with AES and print it).
If you're using linux you might also check out [encFS]( it's really awesome and more failsafe than truecrypt and there's a [port for windows]( too.

Well, it looks like your BTC ended up [here]( together with (probably) more stolen coins.
Buuut.. there is a ultra tiny chance that you might be able to do something.
I was bored so I started following the other outputs of the address your coins got withdrawn to.
It turned out the attacker tried to mix his coins but [obviously failed doing so]( (nice taint, dude).
Anyway alot of coins end up [here]( and that address was used multiple times to [send ~$10k]( to "1LNWw6yC..." which is a deposit address of mt.gox... ha!
I'm not sure if that helps but you might try contacting gox, maybe they can lookup his name, given all the verfication stuff and problems they have because of dudes cashing out stolen funds.
btw.: I have to admit this is kind of cool: [18K9UsPJ..](

As a "young tech *professional*" you should know how to protect your private keys from keyloggers and greedy service providers (for example by using paper wallets for coldstorage).

can't be the reason i got all my btc back and i did &gt;1k trades with them. i believe this is because they think people used the site to launder money from stolen bank accounts and now they have to check all deposits and trades before they can make any payouts
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:32:54
correct. Currently 25 btc block reward + fees for the first one who provides the proof. The block reward is halved every 4 years, so in the year ~2140 the miners will only get "paid" the fees and bitcoin turns in to a full deflationary currency.

well you're wrong. it's called algo trading because those bots use a algorithm to decide how they trade and as a programmer and experimental bot trader i can assure you that each algorithm needs input and produces output. and thats why every bot can be analyzed you just have to find out how it produces it's output. it may be extreme hard because you don't know which bot responds to your probes but it's theoretically possible. those black boxes you talk about are not just fast, companys pay millions to hackers and so called quants to programm them. so i'm sorry but chart heads won't die, they are the future. anyway why you so mad bro?

Well, whenever I get the chance to pay with bitcoin and they are not undervalued, I do it.
I find it alot more comfortable and fun to pay with them (I once bought something for a friend (he didn't knew about bitcoin) and my hotwallet was low, so I had to import a cold storage paperwallet. The WTF on his face while I was typing the private key by hand was quite impressive but I never forget the face he made when the USD balance updated :D)
Anyway I think bitcoin got alot more usecases beside trading and spending, just think about it's use  as ingame currency for example. 
Since we're currently living in times of change and it feels somehow more ok to spend 1BTC than $100 for random crap, I expect alot more stores to accept bitcoin in the coming year.
@_date: 2013-08-21 08:02:38
I get your point and of course it hurts, maybe even alot but people around here are telling other people to buy bitcoins to get their money out even if they'd have to [take a &gt;10% loss]( because they think Mt.Gox has no more money which is in my opinion totally nuts.
Don't forget they're operating since 2010 when bitcoins traded for a few cents, they have alot of coins and they even covered a 2k BTC loss once and right now they're trying to become fully compliant in the US which costs them around $25m in the first year alone.
I don't think this will kill them, karpeles may not look like it but he's a fighter and at least for me gox is still the most trustworthy exchange.
In april there was a [nice article]( about gox, which kind of changed my mind about them.
@_date: 2013-09-29 07:56:52
Yeah that's why you store most of you coins on  paper wallets. If you'd store your credit card data on your computer a virus could steal it, too.
You don't have to use those services to use bitcoin. Just like you don't have to give your paper money to total strangers to use paper money.
