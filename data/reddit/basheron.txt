Amazon's stock price surged way back in the day, even though it was 'just' a bookstore. Investors priced in the future potential of the unique features of Amazon. Amazon had this killer feature that would suggest books based on your and others buying preferences.
Future capabilities are priced in to Bitcoin right now. Lightning network / layer2 is 'the' killer app. The current rally started when investors saw the potential for the segwit soft fork activation.
Yes, everyone wants bitcoin to take over the payment system world RIGHT NOW! But relax, its a process. We only have 1 shot at doing this right, because bigger battles lie ahead. We lost several digital currency battles in the past, lets not lose this one.

On chain transactions were never designed for retail style purchases. Even when the mempool isn't spammed, blocks only happen every 10 minutes.

The Louisiana purchase was 50 cents an acre (inflation adjusted).
Now the average midwest farm acre is worth (conservatively) $3,020. That's a 604,000% increase.
It took roughly 100 years to fully exploit that purchase.
It will take bitcoin 20 years to fully exploit its use.

It's not a fix, its a trade-off.
They are sacrificing decentralization and trustlessness for blockchain capacity. And if Bitcoin is to ever become a world currency, 800mb will be just as bad off.
Blockchains don't scale on chain because bandwidth does not follow moore's law. We have to develop trust-less layers that can be built on top of the blockchain if we want to preserve what we set out for in the beginning.

Layer2 are the solutions. No blockchain can serve micro-payments for everybody across the globe. 
Some solutions are trustless, some are trusted. Depending on the use case will determine what people use.
The greatest benefit is that the chain guarantees a set inflation schedule &amp; can verify the authenticity of the currency built on the layers above. The chain itself is not the end all solution.

It removes volatility by moving exchange trade risk to investors.

No benefit per se, just licensing differences for those that sell software. FreeNAS is a popular FreeBSD distribution for home file/media servers. The only advantage FreeBSD has over linux distros is its ability to separate user environments with jails, which are a lot more efficient than virtual machines.

Most users will likely only use the layer 1 blockchain less than once a year, to onboard to the lightning network. Once you're in lightning, you don't need to write to the blockchain, and fees are ridiculously low, since the marginal cost of hosting a lightning node is near zero.

False. If someone steals my ledger nano S, they get 3 shots at guessing an 8 digit pin, then the device wipes itself. In fact, its safer to protect yourself against theft if you use several hardware wallets than writing down your wallet passphrase on paper.

Technically running a bitcoin node would be an internal service, not external. The service would be running in a jail, which is a compartmentalized operating environment, common on BSD systems. Even if the jail goes 'rogue', its easy to nuke the jail without effecting the host system.
Many home users run FreeNAS for more than file storage. The freenas forums are overflowing with plex and media questions.
A FreeBSD jail is the ideal environment for a state-sensitive lightning node: redundant drive array, modern self healing ZFS file system, and jail compartmentalization. I cringe seeing people run lightning on raspberri pis, they are 1 spinning platter away from catastrophic channel loss, at least until lnd and others integrate live channel backups.

@_date: 2019-10-15 20:34:28
AMP is probably the biggest upgrade lightning will ever have, apart from an accurate model / algorithm for identifying needed capital allocation for routing. 
AMP allows the utilization of multiple separate channels and routes to complete a payment. Right now lightning requires the entire transaction to happen over 1 path, which reduces the maximum transaction amount to the smallest chain in the link.
AMP should massively increase the success rate of payment routing.

Miners believe the longer they can keep transactions on layer1, the more money they can make. Layer 2 bitcoin still needs layer 1 as its security / immutability anchor. There will always be a need for layer1 transactions, and the value and fees will still continue to increase to pay for the layer 1 mining process. The beauty of sidechains is that "bitcoin" can take the form of monero, zcash, or p2p lightning channels. Most (not all) altcoins become irrelevant when the value can be in 1 ecosystem but expressed with varying technologies that never become obsolete in a value sense. If a sidechain loses popularity just move your coins back to layer1 or another sidechain!

President Richard M. Nixon and his globalist sidekick, Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, knew that their destruction of the international gold standard under the Bretton Woods arrangement would cause a decline in the artificial global demand of the U.S. dollar. Maintaining this "artificial dollar demand" was vital if the United States were to continue expanding its "welfare and warfare" spending.
In a series of meetings, the United States — represented by then U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — and the Saudi royal family made a powerful agreement.
According to the agreement, the United States would offer military protection for Saudi Arabia’s oil fields. The U.S. also agreed to provide the Saudis with weapons, and perhaps most importantly, guaranteed protection from Israel.
The Americans laid out their terms. They were simple, and two-fold.
The Saudis must agree to price all of their oil sales in U.S. dollars only. (In other words, the Saudis were to refuse all other currencies, except the U.S. dollar, as payment for their oil exports.)
The Saudis would be open to investing their surplus oil proceeds in U.S. debt securities.

@_date: 2017-11-14 23:03:24
Thank you for your well thought out response. I think comparing Bitcoin to a proactive production software isn't exactly apples to apples.
The reason fees are temporarely so high is due to 2 reasons: Spam transactions and people competing with the spam and each other to get priority. Yes, its a shame that when spammers attack the blockchain we have to pay a higher fee to clear transactions, but understand what you are proposing. Currently the artifical block size limit punishes the spammers with the economic cost of conducting the attack. It doesn't prevent the attack, for sure, but it makes it expensive. This is where we get in to game theory: if bitcoin increases the block size in response to spam attacks, then the economic disincentive by spammers gets incentivized. The spammers get what they want, and they receive a 'return on investment'. Its kinda like "we dont negotiate with terrorists": it prevents terrorist behaviour because they know the outcome.
Now just because an altcoin doesn't suffer from spam attacks, doesn't mean its not a problem. Bitcoin is spam attacked because of its value to users and the political implications of being that status. Noone spam attacks BCH because of its limited users.
Increased fees during spam attacks are a feature: It allows important transactions to happen despite ongoing attacks.
If we removed the block size limitation then bitcoin could be DoS attacked until NO transactions can clear, which is much less ideal than allowing high valued transactions to clear, despite high fees.
The other difference is the public space nature of the blockchain. For bitcoin to be a peer to peer system, the blockchain had to be distributed to a sufficient number of peers to ensure its decentralized nature. 
Thus, the blockchain suffers from "tragedy of the commons", the abuse of public space when noone is given ownership of the space. I dont recall the exact story, but there was a beach in the early 20th century marxist experiment: a public beach, which in the hands of private owners would have tried to preserve its value as a beach, but in the hands of the public the sand was mined until all that was left was a mud hole. When there is no ownership, noone takes care of the public resource.
The blockchain is the same way: it is a public source burdened by private owners (peers). If we abuse that resource, less and less people will host the storage and bandwidth costs until bitcoin loses its peer to peer quality. 
We could argue exactly how we balance that need as a public space vs the loss of decentralization, but we should agree that more efficient use of the space already allocated should be made more efficient before increasing the burden of that public space. Schnorr signatures, layer2/3 seems to be the most efficient use of such space. Because an immutable record can just as effectively store 10 dollars or 20 trillion dollars, IF it can maintain immutability thru its decentralized nature.

And how do you think the government enforces 'net neutrality'? By installing back-doors in network traffic management interfaces, of course!
Yes, the phone/cable company has a monopoly over local markets, but unlimited 4G plans are getting cheaper. Lets not regulatory squash new internet startup ideas. The market always finds an answer and delivers.

Don't confuse featurecreep with sound engineering principles. 
Ethereum has already proven it has no immutability and that its sole unique featureset requires trust in the software built on top of it.
Bitcoins featureset has been to date built in a trustless manner, and trusted software can still be built on top of that.

I agree, but people want to irresponsibly scale to see that vision today. Bitcoin needs to scale on technical merits without losing any of its properties that gives it value today. And that takes time.
We are upsetting a fiat system that has been used for hundreds of years, we can't rush this. All eyes are on Bitcoin. We can't let it fail. Scale has to be done right, even if that means adoption has to slow down for a few more years.

I keep hearing this argument. What killer features does any other blockchain have that makes bitcoin inferior? Monero transactions are immensely size inefficient and does not scale. Zero knowledge proof based blockchains require a trusted key setup. Ethereum's mutability is controlled by a central authority and its young blockchain is growing so exponentially they have to resort to sharding.
Do not mistake featurecreep as best design principles.

@_date: 2017-11-23 23:04:55
The problem with ethereum is its feature set, its a trade off compared to the featureset of bitcoin. On ethereum, you have to trust the applications built for its featureset. Bitcoins featureset is more limited, because they want to maintain its trustless nature.
Ethereum also has broken immutability several times. Its not as good of a store of value.
Ethereums blockchain size has gotten so big in the 2 years its been around that they have to resort to sharding. This also centralizes nodes to only be able to spin up on high bandwidth locations.
In the end, each blockchain serves different purposes based on design principles. Every feature is a tradeoff.

The best and most bleeding edge developers and ideas are being worked on for Bitcoin.
Featurecreep and/or a rush to implement ideas in a short timetable do not make a coin 'the best'.

Blockchain growth is not an issue so long as storage mediums also grow at a typical rate.
Ethereums blockchain size grew 500GB in 2 years, that isnt sustainable, and hence why they are sharding the blockchain.
Right now just about any PC made in the last 5 years can still easily host the bitcoin blockchain, and its projected growth doesnt exceed the growth of mass storage devices.

Because the marginal cost of running a lightning transaction is near zero. Ideally you commit 1 transaction on chain to open a channel, and you may never have to settle to the blockchain again. You can buy /receive on the lightning channel, then spend from that channel. There are economic incentives to not cheat, and if someone does try to cheat, then the second on-chain transaction happens.
The result is a trustless, peer to peer, instantaneous, anonymous, and nearly frictionless payments!

Commits are the last 'step' in the development process. For example, it took several academic cryptography conferences to study the security of schnorr signatures. We are talking about securing the most valuable &amp; immutable record ever conceived by mankind, and to do that right takes time. The bitcoin space is working the long game, to be ready for the real battles ahead. You think NYA was bad? Wait until nation-states try to attack it.
Developers get very little love for the hard &amp; dirty work of keeping the distributed client safe, secure, and efficient, like optimizing databases, ensuring proper network topology, and writing academic research papers, a fact that most altcoins take for granted when they fork Bitcoin Core and add 1 feature.
Bcash will always be core 0.14.2 with 8mb blocks. Add it to the list of altcoins made by copying the core project and adding 1 feature.

100 years from now, Bitcoin will still exist due to engineering decisions to maintain decentralized user validation.
Bcash is a short sighted project of Roger Ver. He's trying to scale in a linear fashion, when we need engineering solutions that scale by orders of magnitude. Without user validation, Bitcoin just becomes another central bank authority.

My node is already uploading 1+ TB a month.
Blockchain with bigger blocks either work because no one uses it (bcash) or concessions are made to centralize nodes (ethereum).
Bitcoin must survive 10, 100, 1000 years from now. Increasing the block size has lasting negative drawbacks, and only kicks the scaling solution cans down the road.
First rule of bitcoin: do not break bitcoin.
I'd rather see bitcoin only succeed for rich people than fail long term for poor people.
No block size increase. Ask me again in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:15:52
Unless you have a scaling solution that doesn't suffer from "tragedy of the commons", then it is fact layer 2/3 is the best answer to date.

Hardware wallets generate your 24 word seed in an offline enclave. Thats what makes it so secure.

@_date: 2017-11-26 15:49:09
Serious. How many other altcoins have tested security protocols so much that they discovered bugs in openSSL, which secures 30% of the internet?
Don't confuse bells and whistles with best development practices. No block chain is more efficient, battle hardened, or decentralized than Bitcoin. There is a lot of academic work being done with core devs and universities to ensure the planned efficiency and privacy features of schnorr signatures are ready for a megabillion dollar network. No other block chain is getting the development talent that lightning brings to scale cheap, instantaneous, and orders of magnitude higher transaction volume.

The technology, as combined, is 8 years old. The tecnology that bitcoin relies on (encryption) is much older and proven.
The tech can scale by orders of magnitude with second layer payment channels. We know for a fact that this will work, its been proven in test ecosystems, the only unknown is what topology we implement to allow this to work. Several models exist, and all of them are possible. Google "lightning network".
Yes, people are speculatively investing in this tech because of how distruptive it is to a banking industry that has not changed much for several hundred years. The payoffs are huge if it suceeds, and as bitcoin currently stands, even if it never improves, already exists to permanently replace services like western union.

It will take time and resources to develop the proper software, but its very easy to implement, since it runs on top of the protocol, no changes are needed to bitcoin itself.

Lightning network that runs as a second layer over the bitcoin blockchain does have the capacity to replace paper currencies. If we try to do all transactions on the blockchain itself it will grow so much that no one can host it on their own computers, and we would need the government or amazon to host it, which kinda defeats the purpose of a decentralized network.

1. The ecosystem is more complex than normal right now, if you have a friend that knows how all this works, ask them for help. If not, continue to step 2:
2. For the sake of newbies: I highly recommend you keep your bitcoin on coinbase.com. They can safely split your coins. Make sure you turn on 2 factor authentication (with an app like FreeOTP or Google Authenticator) on coinbase.com AND your email, you have to do both! Get a hardware wallet like 'TREZOR' or 'Ledger Nano S', keep reading, learn this asset class, and safeguard your private keys. Move your cryptocurrencies to the hardware wallet a few weeks after the hard fork. Some time in December should be safe.
(Pros, hear me out: Yes, I know, "your keys your bitcoin", but coinbase can add replay protection by including new mined blocks in withdraws. I think the party risk vs. newbies losing their bitcoin by replay attack is better in this short timeframe.)

Someone puts up a lot of bitcoin for sale slightly higher than market price, but when the price gets close to that, they remove the order, or move the price above market price again, so it was never really for sale to begin with.

Bitcoin is defined as 'peer to peer cash'. If we increase the block size to large quantities you loose the 'peer to peer' part of it.
Fortunately, we can have both, the lightning network massively increases capacity while keeping the decentralized nature of 'peer to peer'. Here is why layer 2 is the best path forward:
Do you remember what phone companies used to do to 'scale the internet bandwidth'? People got 2 phone lines and multilinked two 56k modems to have 112k speed. This is only a linear expansion, proper scaling needs to go logarithmic. So we got DSL modems, and cable modems, and 4G, and fibre, etc. Each one logarithmic capacity increases. If the phone company just kept laying down more and more 4 copper wire strands for more phone lines, the infrastructure cost would implode the increase in capacity.
Going from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 block sizes is only a linear increase in capacity. If we want to maintain bitcoin as a 'peer to peer cash' system then we need to scale it logarithmic in the same way the internet had to scale logarithmic.

"they can mine 1 MB in half the time of a 2 MB block "
Thats not how it works. Miners are simply trying to find a number that when hashed with the transactions, creates a number with the amount of zeros in the beginning to match or exceed the required difficulty.

It changes over time so that it takes on average 10 minutes to find a block. It is important to limit the speed and space of blocks due to an economic term called "tragedy of the commons". If we allowed unlimited blocks and unlimited block size, the block chain would get so big so fast that no one could host the shared ledger of the blockchain, and as a result we lose the decentralized immutability confidence that makes Bitcoin great.
But dont fear! Layer 2 solutions like Lightning allow unlimited instant transactions with nearly 0 fees to be conducted with zero 3rd parties or trust! It uses the immutability of the underlying blockchain as its security model. The best of both worlds, a decentralozed limited blockchain, and unlimited in-channel transactions!

Yes, however you need to trust that the other person has successfully split their coins, AND all your current UTXOs are in 1 address. To do this, before the fork, send ALL your bitcoin to your own receive address. This will consolidate all of your unspent transaction outputs to 1 address.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:19:24
So, technically, if you trade at .2, and *if* the trade pair goes down to .01, you could buy an equal amount of BT2 tokens as you own BT1, remerge and, and walk away with a nice BTC profit pre-fork.

Basic misunderstandings here, first of all all layer1 nodes need the same blocks, you cant split the network as described. Block size needs to be restricted to prevent spam attacks, on chain transactions need an open market fee to keep the p2p portion of the p2p cash ethos that is bitcoin. If we make the blockchain too big too fast only large corporationa can afford to host it, then we lost the p2p ability.
Layer 2 like lightning is still a work in progress, especially to routing and network topology algorithms. The 'easy' answer is that lightning nodes will centralize to minimize fees into a hub and spoke topology (imagine everyone using lightning thru common payment channels with coinbase) but again, network topology algorithm proposals include a tor-like or mesh designs. But since fees will be so low to the point of the marginal cost and layer 2 is still trustless, users may just provide 0 fee network relays as a benefit of using the network itself.
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:42:00

@_date: 2017-10-11 22:13:58
They aren't the enemies of bitcoin, miners have economic incentive to mine the most valuable chain. Also, you are confusing mining power with signaling, which are two very different things. For example, ViaBTC is signaling NYA, however they publicly stated that individual pool participants can chose to mine BTC or B2X. Signaling does not equal hash power....

Miners want to keep transactions on-chain to collect fees, they see layer 2 apps like lightning as taking that revenue away. Users believe we need the short term capacity increase to prevent early adopters being turned away by high on-chain fees. It comes down to users view of what bitcoin is: Is it an on-chain microtransaction network that needs large centralized servers to make that happen? Or is it a distributed, trustless, censorship resistant store of value system that has market based fees to maintain that? 
What many people don't realize is that it can be both: a distributed, permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant store of value on the blockchain AND a micro transaction network on layer 2 protocols like lightning.
The argument comes down to timing and process, which is sad that people on both sides of the argument want Bitcoin to scale and improve, but degraded into tribal political mud flinging.
I'm on the side that on-chain transactions should be distributed, permissionless, trustless, and censorship resistant, and want micro-transactions off-chain. I also think Bitcoin is too popular for its own good, there is a ton of demand for bitcoin, but at the same time bitcoin is not mature to fulfill that demand. I want it to succeed by its technical merits, 'big blockers' want it to succeed by adoption rates.

Bitcoin's current iteration is NOT a flat line adoption curve. Segwit is a capacity increase. Schnorr signatures, MAST is a capacity increase.
Lightning is an order of magnitude increase in capacity. 
Block weight can be increased by hard fork, but hard forks needs to be planned years in advance, not 3 months.
The reason its an attack is because if a company or group of companies can controlt he development of bitcoin, then governments have their avenue of influence and control: force those companies to write back door code, or KYC, or whatever.

The problem with the Xapo stance is that protocols could change back and forth based on the longest proof of work. Economically speaking I don't think that will happen, but if it does, without replay protection, people will lose money as it switches back and forth.

Why is second layer an agenda? Its the best scaling solution proposed to date. I can do thousands of transactions with only 2 on chain transactions. 
There is more low hanging fruit  to further optimize the blocks before we goto increasing the block size. Schnorr signatures alone is a 25% capacity increase. And WHEN we do a block size increase, we cant be hard forking every time, a reasonable capacity increase formula needs to be explored.
Look at the problems Ethereum is having with their block chain size, they are already resorting to sharding the block chain, and they are only ~2 years old! You cant shard forever, less you start to lose shards!

51% attacks are very limited in what they can do. Miners build blocks, nodes enforce the rules. All miners could do with 51% is double spend their own funds, or mine empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:27:55
Nodes validate the miners work and represent economic activity. Miners follow economic incentive and mine the most profitable (most valued) chain.
The 2x fork and the BTC chain will start with the same difficulty, so if 1 chain is valued less than the other, the economic inventive is to mine the more valuable chain.
Currently on the futures market, 2x is valued at .22 a BTC, "if trends continue", the economic incentive for miners will be to mine BTC, not 2x.

It CAN be done correctly, but not in these time frames.
Hardforks are hard to steer the market with vs. staying with the legacy chain.
If and when we have a hard fork, it needs to be planned years in advance, not months. And we should take advantage of a hardfork with a long list of wanted feature upgrades.

No, because you are not copying value. Post fork, some people put more value into their forked coins, when you sell to the buyer, you are taking in new money, not existing money.
So yes, BTC price could increase if there are people out there willing to buy your forked coins.

Coinbase can add replay protection by mixing newly mined coins into withdraws.

Bitcoin's blockchain does not need coffee economics to thrive.

Yes, inflation. Government can not 'by decree' fix the value of a commodity. If the US Government issues 1 oz .999 fine gold coins and says they are only worth $500, the coins would cease to exist because everyone would melt them down and sell the commodity on the open market. In the same way, if the government declared that same coin is worth $3,000 no one would accept it. (Gold is currently ~1300 per ounce)
Fiat always results in inflation. The temptation to use 'decree' to generate more money and tax people without ever taking their currency away is too great.

Fees are necessary to prevent 'tragedy of the commons', which in this application would mean bloating the size of the blockchain to unsustainable levels. Segwit lowers fees because it takes less 'capacity' on the blockchain. In the future, schnorr signature transactions will also take less 'capacity'. Lightning will allow us to take nearly all of our transactions off chain, and fees are expected to be incredibly small to non-existant.
Solutions are already planned.

I think Bitcoin has succeeded on the level of a new currency, but the payment system is somewhat lacking. It’s very hard to use, and that’s the big challenge on the Bitcoin side.”

state actors in general...?
Anywho, bitcoin needs to prove its anti-fragile ability before wide adoption begins. This not only includes outside actors, but actors from within. It's a growing pain, but I hope it passes like it has passed all others so far.

We had to prove bitcoin could upgrade. At that time people believed Bitcoin had found its weakness / fragility. UASF moved us past that and showed Bitcoin is also anti-fragile in that regard.
More tests will come, especially when central banks start to feel threatened by Bitcoin and governments start using coercion and force against people they identify using Bitcoin. Don't underestimate the governments greed to invisibly increase taxes by manipulating the monetary supply through inflation.

Yeah, I gave up trying on my FreeNAS jail. I'm running a windows VM and run the Bitcoin Core installer in there until core 0.15.x makes it to the repository.

College is for some, but not for all. You can make a fine life for yourself in the trades, and if you employ other tradesmen, you can make more than the college grads.

Could be an online vendor trying to consolidate UTXOs for lower fees in the future. Thats why its at 1 satoshi per byte, theres no rush for this transaction to happen.

I believe transactions that are not face to face use an escrow service....

Well, we got a lot of attention over the last few days due to price, so normies are checking us out.

To be fair, bitcoin is a terrible name for bitcoin, but people use what they know to explain new things. People know dollars and cents, bits and satoshis are easy.

Too big to fail, that and central banking allows governments to continuously increase taxes thru inflation.

Everything is a cause/correlation!
Man, the media just go for the low hanging fruit, don't they?
I'd argue F2Pool withdrawing from S2X caused the rise, but honestly none of us know the desires of moneybadger.

I'm biased, but FreeNAS is a great headless distro for FreeBSD :)

This is why raspberri pis are not ideal, at least until they can support the overhead of a modern self-healing redundant file system like ZFS.

"Keys to the repository" is meaningless. Users decide what software to run, not developers. If the Bitcoin repository went rogue the CODE would be copied to another repository.

First of all, it doesn't matter what satoshi said, this isn't a religion. With that said, satoshi did predict payment channels. [
