I have to disagree with you on that. A lot of people who are HODL try to be optimistic but they’re not delusional. They make memes to soften the blow from bitcoin’s major dips. 
I’ve been mentally prepared to lose all of my bitcoin’s worth since i first bought it. And the purpose of me asking this question is more theoretical than practical. It’s just another version of the age-Old question: Does paper money have intrinsic value?

Is it an original?!

It actually applies no matter what amount you buy. If you invested a significant amount you have more of a reason to think it over and realize that there is a huge risk.

I just hate when people buy bitcoin without understanding risks. Which is why many lives were ruined after the big dip because they don’t mentally prepare themselves to lose so as soon as they experience a loss they wanna back out. You can literally control whether or not to clock in your loss. I rather have a bitcoin worth $1000 than to confirm my loss at $2000.

Um bitcoin is a currency not a stock. Its like saying you can never realize your usd wealth if you don’t spend it.

OP is very much entitled to bragging. Bragging is allowed under certain circumstances like this where his friends called him a moron and said btc was a scam. They didn’t call btc a scam out of OP’s best interest. They clearly didn’t care whether he lost his money and only cared enough to make fun of him for it. If it weren’t for that moron bit, then the text would totally be uncalled for.

Wouldn’t be surprising if they had to do with the big dip. There’s many ways it could’ve been done the easiest way being manipulating the media’s tone on btc.

You could even make it so that the purchase isn’t all at once causing a steady increase to attract more people

Regardless of the risk doubling the market cap will reflect in the price heavily so even if people sell right after a net worth increase of 50% will grant you that much more money

I didn’t buy bitcoin solely for the purpose of gaining money. I’m holding it until there’s a mainstream acceptance. I’m young and I have no responsibilities yet so my money is good where it is thank you very much
