Any idea how you got infected?
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:19:30
Because the halving will bring major user adoption or something?
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:21:28
I was showing you how i got downvoted and called a troll because someone didn't agree with me. 10 minutes after your post where you implied this stuff doesn't really happen here unless you say something really stupid. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:12:08
Obligatory, no. Annoying, desperate and irrelevant, yes. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:02:03
Everytime when i think i've seen it alll here i get proven wrong. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 11:21:49
Yes, i'm such a troll for not joining the circle jerk. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:58:15
You trolls? What's that supposed to mean? And i never said Bitcoin was dead. Why would i?
And thanks for the downvote. Such a great tool when someone says something you don't agree with, right.

Yes, that guy spammed a zeroShedge link for 2 or 3 days. The mods deleted the posts but for some reason didn't ban the url so he was able to post it many times and probably infected quite some people. Malwarebytes probably didn't pick it up because it was a new exploit? Took a few days for them to learn about it. Just guessing.
You think he had full access to your computer or just a keylogger? 
I have no idea what that is what he deleted but he most likely deleted it because he used it and it left traces of him.

In 2017?
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:18:31
This rdiculous article was already posted. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:59:55
Riiiight. So now it's suddenly 2017 where "it" will happen. 
I love how we just pull random dates out of our ass like that. 
Well at least we can stop with all the bullshit here for 2 years. Just sit back and wait for 2017.

What is Mycoin? Another exchange? Hacked?
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:51:56
Because he recently said he isn't interested in using Bitcoin. Since then he is old, clueless, no idea about technology, irrelevant, a crook and so on. 
When he last year said that he considers Bitcoin a great invention he was praised as if it was Jesus reborn.

You mean like this? 15 minutes ago?
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:28:43
I sure haven't. Kinda odd if they're that big. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:11:41
What does this have to do with "how Bitcoin works"?
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:26:24
Bitcoin might be dead by the end of this year. The thing is nobody knows. Nobody on this planet knows. 
It keeps amazing me how you people just present the wildest predictions as facts. Over and over again. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:01:18
I remember the last 6 months of 2013 where threads like this popped up several times. 2014 was where it was gonna happen. 2014 was the year things would get huge. At least 10k per coin and mainstream adoption. 
Anybody who questioned this was frantically downvoted to hell. They were called trolls and paid shills. You had no clue how Bitcoin works if you couldn't understand why it would happen in 2014. Well, we all know how that worked out. 
I have no idea what will happen in 2017. Bitcoin might be huge or it might be dead. 
But please, can you people for once learn from the past and your mistakes. This really is a nasty flashback to 2013. We're doing exactly the same thing. Just calm down a bit and for god's sake stop downvoting people just because you don't agree with them. This place is for discussion. From both sides. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:45:22
Because everyone who knows how Bitcoin works just knows 2017 is the year it will happen. Right?
One of your 9 upvoters is also free to answer that. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:40:25
Yes exactly. An exchange. These people are pumping money in an exchange that makes them money. They don't give a shit what that exchange exchanges. Bitcoin, altcoins or bananas. All they care about is the profit.
All these fundings left and right have very little to do with Bitcoin itself. They just see profit and couldn't care less where the profit comes from.
Do you see any company putting millions in developing the Bitcoin core?
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:52:16
Wait till we get to the quickening. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:04:51
Just another insane post from one of the most insane posters here. 
That you lost your wife and all your money due to bad investments in the past what does that tell you? Take a guess?
