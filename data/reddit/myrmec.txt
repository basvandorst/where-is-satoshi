Transaction fees on the main bitcoin chain will probably descend, but stay above what they used to be. Coffee purchases will most likely be done on a higher settlement later or in other cryptos.
No crypto can do high volume cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:35:39
My average charge is over $500 and I can’t get people to pay with BTC because they think it’s going to spike tomorrow, or they’ve been told that the fees are $30 (they are not, but they turn around and give $30 to an ATM)

It got too popular too fast. Fees were a fraction of a penny a year ago, but now everyone on earth wants in and fees are way up to like $20.
Just to be clear, no other crypto could handle this volume either.  Not even close.  They transact cheap because nobody uses them.

How about Bitcoin Cash?  I don’t hear you chanting “bgold” etc.  It reeks of insecurity.
I’ve been a hodler for years and you’re really bringing this whole thing down by shitting on BCH.  It’s a legitimate competing fork, an implementation of a different development philosophy — it’s very existence proves the supremacy of Bitcoin.  THIS IS HOW COMPETITION WORKS.
Every time I read “bcash” I just think of a trashy ex girlfriend talking smack. Fucking relax with the shit talk. We’re better than this and we’re over it.

Assange is inferring that crypto was created as a response to government-corporate collusion and irresponsibility.
Government funds a lot of its actions (like bailouts) by inflating its currency, which is not possible with many ctyptos.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:38:19
Fees were a few pennies before this massive surge of interest.  I suspect they will go down again as things level out. Then when these lightning layers start going in, use cases will be quite different.
Even now though, you can move $100,000,000 worth of BTC (if you have it) across the planet, in 10min, with absolute security, for $15.

Our ancestors worked together to form governments and granted them the power to enforce taxation (with representation) in order to accomplish things. We the people continue to work together to maintain that system. I don’t know if any country in reality that subsists on donations?
You aren’t coerced to do anything. You can choose to earn under the taxable minimum.  You can choose to go offshore and earn whatever you want and not pay taxes.  But if you want to stay here and prosper, enabled by taking advantage of the myriad of services that we have decided to fund to move towards utopia, you have to pitch in.

Libertarians were the first ones fired up about the bailout.  It’s the opposite of a free market solution.
Socialists and moderate liberals (a different thing that “commies” btw - that’s like calling republicans “Nazis”) got involved because the government was bailing out the rich and powerful for reckless practices.
The moral of the story is that these two groups have a lot in common, and bitcoin serves both of their interests.

*TL;DR: Yes you can get suspended over nothing by lazy school officials, and no it doesn't effect your life.*
In my highschool art class, we had a sub one day and no assigned work so we were all just sitting around chatting.  I was wasting time cutting a paint stirrer into strips and gluing them together, while quietly talking with the two hot girls I unsuccessfully macked it to all semester.  About 60 minutes into class (they were 90min if I recall, this was 1998 or so) school security and two real police officers run into the room and surround me.  I'm shocked, the girls are shocked, everyone has their best WTF face on.  Except the sub who never even looks up from his newspaper.
They take me to the disciplinarian, who is absolutely fuming mad.  He's asking me questions like "What were you intentions?"  I'm completely dumbfounded and I tell him so.  He slaps my glued pile of sticks on his desk and tells me I'm being suspended for crafting a weapon (At this point it sort of looked like a big jack made of pine sticks, without a sharp edge on it.  I seriously was just absentmindedly doodling with glue and a paint stirrer) and threatening the sub (who I hadn't spoken to, disrespected, or even really looked at other than to hear we weren't doing anything in class.  We had no prior history or anything.)
I was suspended for 3 days, graduated with a 3.4, was voted most artistic out of 1200 kids, earned a BFA in illustration, have a successful art career that I love, and support a family of 4.  I hope the sub and disciplinarian still love their jobs.

It takes transactions off the main chain, and is a place where companies and banks can make money from you by processing your transactions. They can also impose their own rules there, like removing privacy or allowing refunds, etc. It's not Bitcoin.

Well maybe the floor will be there in a couple years.
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:17:07
You have a 30 year wait.  I recommend not paying any attention to BTC till you are thinking about retirement!  :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:24:23
I'm kind of a novice but here's my understanding:
Two opposing philosophies on how to fit more transactions into the network.  Miners wanted a bigger block network - think replacing cars with busses (which they'd make more money on), and the developers and traditional banks wanted "segwit/lightning/sidechains/whatever" - non-Bitcoin sidestreets (which *they* would make more money on)
Basically two greedy dishonest sides playing chicken with the rest of us in tow.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:06:26
Chill man.  This stuff is highly technical and counterintuitive.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:10:22
Resting bitch face?
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:50:17
I would say that with a huge influx of new people right now, this is the worst time to experiment.  We should double the block size yesterday and just see how it goes for a while.  I agree, a 20-year plan is a bit ridiculous for something this volatile.  You don't worry about mortgage rates when you're in 5th grade.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:37:09
I'm... I'm so sorry...

Crime?  So you don't use cash then either, right?
The only thinks I've purchased with BTC so far are video games, Internet access, and stickers.
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:22:32
Please don't talk like that
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:58:03
My understanding is that you can just follow the trail from wallet to wallet?  And even tumblers aren't 100%?
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:03:41
It's cash.

Just search "Bitcoin" on Craigslist.  Plenty of people are accepting it.
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:48:46
This makes Bitcoin largely impractical for almost everyone in real-world situations.

 &gt;it's very much cash, you need cash to open up a bank account. and when your transaction clears, you get cash in the end.

"Second layer payment system" or whatever.  It's not Bitcoin, it's another layer of service right?  You're storing value with someone then transacting off-chain, unless I'm misunderstanding something.
I'd rather they just threw more processing power at mining (isn't it more profitable the higher fees get?) rather than throw more processing power at sidechains.
