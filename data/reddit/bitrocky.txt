"The Journal was turned into a propaganda vehicle for its owner's conservative views. That's half the definition of Fox-ification," he wrote. "The other half is that Murdoch's media outlets must shill for his business interests. With the News of the World scandal, the Journal has now shown itself willing to do that, too."

I would do it on an exchange that allows limit orders and setup the orders to bracket and trade both sides of the market once you have accumulated a few coins. Add more weight to the buy side to accumulate or the sell side to distribute. Here's my book. in your case multiply by 10 or 20...

Thanks OP for a thoughtful question. I have been wondering about the mechanics of wallets for a while (how they assign coins to addresses) which I have not seen anywhere.
Another question I have is "Can you spend specific coins in your wallet?"
