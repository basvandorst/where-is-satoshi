So if I had bitcoin for the last two years I could go back and get my coins from all those hard forks? Or I have to do it when it happens?

Thanks a lot, I bought too but only $350. Maybe a heads up a little sooner next time!?

Haha very clever. I only ask because I want to move my bitcoin over there and get the free hard fork coins. [BTCD.io](btcd.io)

Fuck this dip shit. I'm ashamed to say I have a Chase account, only because they bought my local bank out, but not anymore!!! Fuckers just lost my business.
