libertarianism is high-minded stupidity though. its just for extremely right-wing young people who dont want to be ostracised by their liberal peers.

You could repost this to if you want some easy karma. I'm too lazy to do it but the idea shouldn't go to waste.

Will this mean they no longer have to pay tax? If they accept payment in bitcoin, then couldnt their profits theoretically be $0/year?

The tech doesn’t matter if there’s no demand. Nobody wants to use crypto and making crypto less shit doesn’t change that. 
People want their money to be readily accessible and easy to use. They don’t care if it’s decentralised or deflationary. Crypto is never going to take off unless people start using it. Businesses are not going to suddenly start paying salaries in crypto, partly because that would be illegal and partly because it would have no benefits to the business. Therefore a crypto takeover of the economy has to be consumer driven. If consumers are getting paid in USD then they will have to convert to crypto to make purchases in crypto. There is no reason for them to do this other than the novelty. 
It doesn’t matter how good the tech is because for the average person crypto is just a reinvention of the wheel, and it doesn’t fit their existing car.

The internet was being used for its intended purpose by many many people in the 90s.
Bitcoin is not the internet. We have digital fiat currency and have been using it for decades. From the perspective of the average consumer bitcoin provides nothing of value and there is no interest in it.
To a certain extent it is impossible to discuss crypto with a person who thinks it is exactly the same as the internet and is therefore destined to succeed. It’s not an argument that is based in reality.

Crypto hasn’t even come close to matching the economic inertia that gives fiat currency its stable value. 
The vast majority of crypto owners have no interest in using it as a day-to-day currency. A limited number of vendors do accept bitcoin in exchange for goods, but I have never seen a mainstream vendor who advertises prices in bitcoin. They advertise prices in fiat.
The idea that crypto solves a problem is always presented in vague terms. There is no demand for an alternative currency. Nobody really cares about using bitcoin. Nobody is buying bitcoin because it improves their ability to operate in the economy on their preferred terms. 
Crypto investors can go on and on about the benefits of crypto, but the fact is that nobody cares. And if nobody cares, then the imagined benefits are just a meaningless sales pitch.

OP can do what he wants, but he looks like an asshole.
