Not when competition is involved, with 10k transactions there is significantly more transaction fees meaning more and more compete for a share and consume electricity in the process.


The minimum btc transaction fee is 0.0005 BTC * the current market value of $10 is 0.5 cent. This transaction fee goes to the miners who spend the majority of it on electricity (and hardware).


One miner could produce all the 7200 BTC per day, but again when competition is involved it doesn't work like that. More and more miners join and a balance is form with most of the profit going to electricity.

Interesting points.


When 50 BTC block rewards stop miners have no incentive to include a transaction with 0 fees so it would probably take years to get accepted.


To me it's not beyond a stretch of the imagination to imagine miners and pool colluding to drive the transaction fees up.
For example if the big 3 pools slush, deepbit and btcguild decided they were no longer accepting transactions without a 2% fee they could make other transactions 80% slower. So as a consumer I can either pay the fee and have my transaction processed in an hour or refuse to pay and have it take several days, if speed is required then users will have to pay. If the pools who are charging the fee can offer greater returns than others then more and more miners move to those pools and fees get higher and higher.


Yes, probably not linearly, but with increased volume you have more incentive to steal. If people are paying no transaction fees and mining is not profitable then security suffers.


It is 1314000 Megawatt hour, so 150,000 MW. Maybe not a problem, but is it the best way to use our finite resources?

If bitcoin became mainstream law enforcement would still need to protect it, your wallet can be stolen just like a credit card number. Regulation is one no longer needed but a lot of these costs would still be required. 
Yes printing money does consume resources (It costs ~7 cents to make a $1 USD bill), as does mining gold, but that doesn't necessarily make bitcoin a better alternative.

I was unable to find the information on any server farms. But for a guesstimate say 100,000 servers worldwide @ 200 watts each = 175,200 MW-hr/yr. Of course you have various end points, ATMs, tills etc but in a bitcoin world this would still be required.

I'm afraid it is you who does not understand. The majority of transactions fees will be spent on electricity and the majority of money earned from mining bitcoins will also be spent on electricity.
