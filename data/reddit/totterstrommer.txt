Uncreative cunts?? Y would u say that?

You going to just dany any argument stated toward bitcoin, no matter how valid it may sound?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:02:44
It has been but it won’t be forever. This is a fact.

It doesn’t ”speak for itself”. Yes, the most risky ones are the best options for gaining ”fast money”. Is this new for you?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:02:09
Cash? I assume you mean you can pay with bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:35:49
So why wouldn’t you wait you actually have that 6K and then buy some BC with it??

How you define moon? Some people think it’s now
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:15:07
People need some limit that they know when to sell &amp; buy lambo. 10 k is a nice round number.

If bitcoin crashes to $1000, I’d call that inflation (value of my money decreases)

Pls don’t

Tf you talking about? Apple has taught us the exact opposite: it has done nothing first but everything better than competitors. Or were you just being sarcastic?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:46:59
Isn’t it clear there’s plenty of newcomers? More serious question is, who’d sell at ATH when the price has veen climbing for 8 years.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:05:35
I guess. Just don’t see what the result of this Twitter poll is ”speaking”.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:21:53
Yes but Apple wasn’t first. In your analogy, Bitcoin would be Nokia or Blackberry and some new hip alt coin would be Apple.

Yeah like everyone wouldn’t know that moron
