This is dangerous misinformation.

No. Not everything is gatekeeping in a shitty bad way. Some things are more proven than others and pointing that out isn’t being classist, or superior or whatever.

But at the time $32 was the highest it had ever been, and then it dropped. 
The losses for somebody who had say 800 bitcoins back then were comparable to the loss someone who had 1 bitcoin experienced this month. 
What’s wrong with your assertion is that you assume bitcoin will never be higher than 20K again, but history shows that bitcoin has frequently recovered from losses of 50% in value. It has happened a number of times. 
So while this was the biggest overall loss of value in American dollars, this kind of thing has totally happened many times before. 
Imagine how strange a comment like yours would look if it had been about the drop from 32$.

You haven’t lost money until you sell your bitcoin. Hold it.

So nothing. 
Slipping tire was suggesting it was a conflict of interest, with an implied judgement that this was "bad". 
Quiz was clarifying that it wasnt a conflict, but simply a bias. His post didnt come down on either side of whether it was "bad". 
Theres nothing wrong with the winklevii pumping up bitcoin.

Much better :)

Yeah a bull attacking something below it completely destroys the metaphor.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:34:43
So, if the market is bullish, it tips towards the bull, which makes the bull look up. But if it's a bear market, it tips toward the bear, which makes the bear look up... which destroys the original metaphor.  
Further, if the bull is down, that's a good thing... which is the opposite of what the chart would show.  
I just don't think this thing makes any sense.

not to the new adopter who just sunk thousands of dollars into bitcoin because he heard from a pal how great it is. I'm not criticizing bitcoin, I'm just trying to help maintain expectations. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:36:18
that sounds right. The drop seems to fall just under where it would have been before.

I agree. But not everyone coming into this subreddit is going to be approaching this with a level head. The point of the thread is to try and help ground people who are off "to the moon". 
Everybody loves to say "oh you gotta be in it for the long haul, don't look at the price this week or last, worry about five to ten years!" 
But in my opinion, that can be problematic as new people adopt. They see the price skyrocketing and want to jump on while they can, all the while maintaining that mantra "ya I'm in it for the long haul!" - then a few days later their investment is halved. 
We heard about a few people last time whose lives were ruined, because they put their life savings into bitcoin and then it crashed. In at least one instance I can remember, it put a redditors marriage on the rocks. Now - did they hold on to their bitcoins and are now finally seeing their reward? Hopefully. But some people jump onto this subreddit, see nothing but clear sky posts, and get reckless. 
I'm just trying to remind everybody that spikes like this can be tricky, and we shouldn't be getting TOO excited. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:24:05
no, I'm not touching mine for at least a few years. I'm literally thinking about other people. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:39:50
oh it will recover. But if it drops, maybe it'll take a long while before it comes back to the same place. And people who are just adopting, and getting excited might be in for a bit of a shock next week, that's all. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:53:21
well, media pulled people in last time too. I guess we'll see. But as other people have mentioned in this thread - what matters is the long haul, so welcome to bitcoin! :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:38:03
I am. I'm just concerned that people will be buying now, then getting very upset when it crashes later this week. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:29:51
agreed. The amount of hyperbole going on around here is insane. On both sides. 
Bitcoin has the potential to be something very valuable, NOT as simply a cash-in opportunity, but as a currency, as a tool. 
If you invest now (still very early in it's lifetime) you're investing in an experiment that could yield long term benefits for the PLANET. maybe. 
And in return for that investment, just like any other, you may get a sizable return. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, and it never was meant to be. 
The past few weeks have seen an enormous influx of people who misunderstand that. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:09:36
a lot of people felt really shitty after buying bitcoin at $220 last spring. Sure it bounces back slowly, but it still sucks for people jumping on the bandwagon. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:17:08
agreed. I bet it could be done. Right now it seems they're only paypal though. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:22:48
this is the best post on here all day. 
I'm just grumpy because I bought into all this (yes, with the money I could afford to lose) at a time when BTC was worth twice what it is now. 
I have faith in the long haul, but can't help but feel stupid.
