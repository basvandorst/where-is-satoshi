Is the Coinbase timestamp different from the bitcoin transaction timestamp through looking on the blockchain?

tipping seems like a great way to transfer bitcoin from holders to the mainstream.

There has been no active development to Armory in over 2 months.

What is the most secure android wallet? Are there any non-web wallets for android?

I've been reading through Nolo's recent threads. He doesn't seem experienced in taxation. bitcointalk.org seems like a big troll pit, it's really hard to know what's really going on over there.

Every method except cash/goods transaction in person is reversible. You are correct, the bar for reversal of bank transfers is higher. Most bitcoin exchanges now have multi-tiered limits and KYC procedures even for bank transfers because of the possibility of reversals.

Asking law students is an interesting idea, but it doesn't really address the main concern. I'd like to talk to a lawyer, and have him/her prepare some document so if the IRS/whoever comes knocking on my door, I'll have something to show them, and someone credible backing it up.

Didn't even know TradeHill was still around. I've been only paying attention to exchanges monitored by bitcoincharts. Thanks for bringing them up again!

There is a risk of project abandonment for any OSS. It's unknown if this is a short hiatus or if it's an indefinite break. Given my very limited information and very limited research, Electrum seems more likely for long term success.
Electrum has 3 main contributors, dependent on 1 language (python), and seems to have the main functionality of Armory (for my purposes). Armory has been done mostly by 1 main contributor, is dependent on also installing the Satoshi client, and uses 3 different programming languages (python, c++, and java).
I could be totally wrong, but it seems like Electrum is a better bet at this point. I would love to contribute and or take over Armory, but it would take way too much ramp up time compared to learning and contributing to Electrum. I'm also probably not alone.

Why not sell your place in line via ebay? At least you'll be able to make money from it.

From May 30 2013, 
I’ve told my friends that it is entirely rational to allocate one percent of your assets to Bitcoin -- as I have. Call it schmuck insurance. As the 2008 crisis proved, schmucks can cause a world of damage.
Taken at face value, Chamath was worth $200 million at the time, and ~$2 million worth in BTC. Since that article in May 2013, both FB stock and bitcoin have nearly doubled.

Sending money directly from a bank account can also be reversed. There are people that hack bank account logins, then convert money to bitcoin. Or you could be dealing with some sort of drug money. These transactions are then later reversed, much to a seller's surprise. This is for both ACH and wires.

What are good NYC meetups for meeting other bitcoin developers / contributors? I'm just playing around with making bitcoin apps and want to make sure I'm following best practices, etc.

This doesn't really answer the question. The acquisition problem also affects SecondMarket's Bitcoin Trust. If they get some investor that wants $1,000,000 into bitcoin, and need to buy more to fulfill the order, what could they do that other people couldn't do?
