Im just as confused as you are, im not sure why the transaction went through and why the address was not checked for errors. But this is not a hoax post and I am not lying, I have contacted Paxful support and have a very lengthy email conversation with their support team, I have escalated my issue to the site admins and I am waiting for a resolution to occur, I will let you know whatever happens.

Lol read the post, also why the fuck would I be making this up??? just asking

At this point I don't think anything I can say will convince you that im not lying, so I am willing to send screenshots just to prove my innocence
seriously though if you don't believe me after this then I don't know what will
also the intended address was:  1K7JtE4x3s1U5Mc2nT9CVF4rDJu1PdWqu1 
the error occurred between the s and U resulting in this address  1K7JtE4x3slU5Mc2nT9CVF4rDJu1PdWqu1 
you can check both on block explorer if you really still don't believe me

Dude you got me, howd you know? but seriously I can't have bought drugs since this is a user error sending from paxful, and its not enough (a small amount as described in the post) to warrant me hiding it from my wife, I gotta say though you're a pretty creative person

I was transporting the bitcoin to a wallet on my laptop running on linux, I did double check and the error was changing a 1 to a l since the characters on my Linux machine can easily be confused when dealing with 1's and l's

Actually then in that case you are correct, if you had actually read the post you would know that it was a mistype and therefore sent to an invalid address,

l as in lowercase L, not | there's quite a difference there...
