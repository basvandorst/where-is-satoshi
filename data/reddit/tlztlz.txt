Can I be honest? There is no added value for me. You talking in length what the market did and how you reacted to it. It's boring.
Also it's not personal enough because there is no face. Just your voice.

But I wish you good luck.

BRD wallet is not my favourite anymore. The user has to proactively turn on Segwit address support for lower fees. I also had problems syncing.
Good beginner wallets are HODL, Blockstream's Green address, Eclair and BlueWallet (custodial).

I don't want to confuse you. But there are no coins. No files that send around computers. Then we have the double spending problem. When you have a file, you can copy it. Double the money. The one video I posted from 3Blue1Brown explains it pretty well.
If you don't want to spend on a hardware wallet yet that's ok. I would use a software wallet on your phone. Phones are generally speaking more safe than PC's because you don't have root access.
If you are ok carrying around 250$ in your pocket. But if the value goes up to 300$ or more only keep a fraction in your pocket/phone. Please consider a hardware wallet.
Good Mobile- or hot wallets (because they are connected to the internet all the time) are: HODL, Blockstream's Green address, Eclair or BlueWallet.
This wallets generate their own keys. Write the mnemonic words down. Store it somewhere safe in your house. Write it down again and store it at your parents house. The private key is never shown per se. You only transfer with your public keys.

Rule  only invest what you are willing to loose.  
Rule  not your keys not your Bitcoin  
Rule  only invest in, what you understand.  
Additional tipps: can you pay your normal bills without that money. Rent? For the next 6 months?  
How long will you hold on, when you lost 90% of your investment? When will you sell? Timeframe in years or % in gains?
You shouldn't take investment advice from the interwebs. DYOR do your own research. If everyone advice you to invest 1k, would you listen to strangers on Reddit? Why? So you don't have to decide for yourself?

well informed, stubbornly irrational and in many cases, unethical minds in the world.
You're up against the computer that can react faster than you. 
The trader who has more experience than you. 
The fund that has more money than you. 
The insider that has more information than you. 
The others that will misinform you. 
The inner voice that will do it's best to undo you.
So, leave all your dreams of making quick and easy money, behind.
The first aim is survival. 
Your absolute first goal is to learn how to stay in the game.
You can only do this by mapping the territory. 
By understanding how the enemy thinks and acts. 
By having a solid game plan. 
And by picking your battles very, very carefully.

**DON'T PUT YOUR PIN ONLINE! NEVER**
Splitting half is really a bad idea. The chance that you loosing one is high risk. If a robbery occur hackers can brute force the rest of the words in weeks.
Keep your words in a bank account is the worst. They can get seized and stolen. Not your keys not your money. And you just give them away. Keep your seed safe in multiple places.

Yes it's complicated. Electrum is a good wallet for PC. I highly advise you go hardware wallet first, mobile and then software wallet. Send 5 bucks worth of Bitcoin to your mobile wallet. Then to your electrum. So you learn. Also about the fees.  I always use 1- to 5 sats per byte never more.
If you learned a lot, you can transfer the rest to a hardware wallet.

Congrats, welcome to the club!
The seed or the mnemonic 12/24 words is the information that creates the private key. The private key is used to sign a transaction. The public keys are generated from your private key. Public keys are like a bank account number. They are public. You can email them, post them, print them etc. 
It's like a letterbox with two keys. You can give away your public keys so that someone can unlock the little lid to put something in. But only you can take it out with your private key. Therefore private keys have to stay private. Never ever save them as a backup online or on your PC. Not your keys not your money! All exchanges have your keys. Otherwise they can't send you your Bitcoin.
The other way around it also works. Like a billboard with a lid. Only you with your private key can post something on the billboard behind glas. Only people with the public keys can open the lid and read. But they can't post information.
A hardware wallet keeps the private key save. It never leaves the device. You have to sign a transaction by pressing physically buttons on the device. Therefore you can use the hardware wallet on a malware, spyware and virus infected windows 95 laptop that you bought on a black market in Russia. Because no hacker can crawl out of your computer and press the buttons. Off course there are still attack vectors. But it's pretty save. 
As soon as you have a hardware wallet, you send your Bitcoin to the wallet.

This is a question for First, don't tell anyone how much you own. You are a honeypot for hackers now. The lack of your knowledge will attract them even more.
Yes buy a hardware wallet first. Trezor, nano s, digital Bitbox. Use the wallet to create a new address. New seed = new private key. Don't import your old private key from Bitcoin core. Now send your bitcoin to the new address in your wallet. Don't type in the public address, copy it. Wait until it arrives. Double check if it's in your new wallet and gone on your bitcoin core wallet. To be triple save, make a backup of your bitcoin core wallet. The private key. Pen and paper. Never digital.
Then you can delete bitcoin core. But just then.

You signed up on coinbase with KYC. They and the IRS know who you are and when and how much you bought.
Buy BTC. Transfer to an exchange that had Monero trading. Monero is a privacy coin. Sender, recipient and amount is hidden. Buy Monero with your BTC.
Now send your Monero to xmr.to with your BTC Trezor address. 
xmr.to is like a VPN to your BTC. You completely breake the link from your coinbase ID to your Trezor. But up to sending xmr to xmr.to you can be tracked!

This is something only you can and must decide. Try to be reasonable. Not greedy. Don't let emotions steer your decision. Fear of missing out, greed, ...
You ask is that good? Why do you want strangers on the interwebs decide for you? Take responsibility. Make a plan, stick to it. 300€ every month sounds a good start. Only invest what you are willing to loose! Don't be reckless. Install a mobile wallet. Save your seed. Get a small amount of Bitcoin. Learn how to send an recieve, fees etc. Buy a hardware wallet. Set it up.
And yes I like getbittr.
Good luck.

Only selling 100 USD for bitcoin shouldn't hurt that much. Nobody knows how much  the price goes up or down. Bitcoin price fluctuate much higher than dollars.
The USD has fallen against what? Bitcoin? Gold?
The *purchasing power* of **any** fiat has fallen due to money printing out of thin air.

Many wallets have different use cases and attack vectors. They all need to be open-source and not tied to your identity. Phone number, email etc.
Greewallet is a good starting point. They just introduced TOR on their android and iOS app.

**Bitcoin doesn't care** would be the better design.
You can't regulate bitcoin out of your country but you can regulate your country out of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:29:57
Yes privacy is costly. Time wise, complexity wise and money wise, because converting costs.
The main problem is, Bitcoin runs on an open system. Also when you want to buy, you have to touch the banking system. Therefore KYC and AML. If you use a decentralised exchange like bisq, then it's different.
In Switzerland there are ATMs where you can buy up to 5k per day without KYC. But that's Switzerland. There you can also buy jewellery up to 300k in cash per payment.

How Bitcoin works under the hood: 
 
@_date: 2019-08-08 11:36:36
Why do you want to sell Bitcoin when the price of Bitcoin goes up?
When you bought Bitcoin for USD in the last month, you could sell it today for a gain of 100%. 1 BTC = 6000 USD a month ago. Now 1BTC = 12000 USD. You could sell 0.5 BTC for 6k USD and still have 0.5 BTC worth of 6k USD.
If you sold Bitcoin for USD in the last month you would lost hard in comparison. 
I think we have a misunderstanding. But your conclusion is right. HODL on and buy more of this bitcoin.

Imagine a string with beets on it. Like an abacus with some beads on it. You put the beads on it with opening a channel. On your side it's 5$ beads. Let's ignore the 2$ difference from now. You can spend by moving the beads from your left to the right. Unfortunately before you spend you can not recieving. Because there are no beads on the right.
The 5$-3$ difference is the fees to open and close the channel. I do oversimplify here a little bit.
So you have 3$ outbound capacity and 0 $ inbound capacity.

This would be a hardfork. Change in code that is not backward compatible. What you described is like litecoin or BitcoinCash. It will be another shitcoin. Bitcoin Plus or so. 
I will not be part of it and continue to mine on the original chain. Two of my friends also. Therefore Bitcoin will survive. This is exactly why Bitcoin is such a hard money. BTC is written in stone and can not be changed. That's why all the other coins are way less secure. A foundation, a group, some core devs or just a couple of miners can change it and say let's print more money.
**Nah, thank you. I stick with Bitcoin. I know what I get there exactly!**

Darling. Someone on the street you don't know approaches you. He made you create a bank account. He now wants to have your bank account number. On top of that he wants to have your online passwords to check your bank account. So full access. He can now change the password and lock you out. He than can use your bank account for whatever he thinks.
Do you personally know this person? Do you have his name and address? Company name? Probably not.

Do they promise you high returns in short time? Ask yourself why they don't keep their profits for themselves.
Is it a pyramid/Ponzi system? You get money by onboarding other poor souls?
Do you need to send them money to get your money?
Why do they have to hide behind torrent address? Something shady going on?
Do they have a clear open company address/contact/people faces on their site? Probably not.

Bitcoin is in his early stages. Like the internet. Want to send an email? Go to an university mainframe in the cellar. Back then you even had to route your email yourself before SMTP. Bitcoin is there. Hard to use. Clumsy and slow. Prone to errors.
Now look where we are. My mom's emailing me with a swipe of the finger from her iPad. That's where Bitcoin will be. With the internet technology 30 years in place it will exponentially support  evolution.

I gave a speech to some politicians in this small town Steckborn. While I was waiting for my bus, I stumbled upon this sign. A little quirky coffee shop. I was interested what system he uses and how he integrated it into his non BTC PointOfSale system.
He just printed his QR code. On his POS he choose other currency/voucher. Because his sell needs to go into the system.

I would say for me to use a passphrase on a Ledger is more secure than the risk of forgetting/loosing it. I don't keep the passphrase at the same place.
It shows that security is not a black/white thing, but a range.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:34:44

Microcontroller (MCU)
The Secure Element checks the full microcontroller flash at boot. You will be at more risk to not update your HW wallet.
But nothing is 100% secure: 
In the above video they were not able to retrieve your keys, only add a new software on it.
That's why a strong passphrase is a must. Even if someone gets your keys. A passphrase acts as a strong 25th mnemonic word.
You can use an old laptop with a bootable os to update your ledger. But you need to verify that you got the update from the right source. 
Good security is hard....
Viel Spass am Gerät!

It gets converted immediately to cash. The hotel is not (yet) interested in holding bitcoin. This was also a clear decision as a marketing move. There are not many transaction in bitcoin at the hotel, almost no need/questions from customers. 
But nonetheless this is a great sign for bitcoin adoption. Like the Amazon of Switzerland Digitech/galaxus also implemented a system when your purchasing above CHF 100.-
