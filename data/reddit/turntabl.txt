New York, NY — Jeffrey M Kurzon, a local attorney and former Obama organizer, announced today his campaign Kurzon for Congress is now accepting Bitcoin, the digital currency that the IRS recently ruled as a form of property. He is the first New York federal candidate to do so. Kurzon is a Democrat on the ballot for the June 24 primary. He is one of the few federal candidates in the United States to refuse monies from PACs and lobbyists.
In May the FEC announced unanimously to allow political committees to accept Bitcoin in increments up to $100 in value. Donations can be made on Kurzon for Congress’ website using Bitcoin payment processor, Coinbase.
Kurzon stated:
Big banks and corporations through their PAC and lobbyist contributions have made puppets out of Congress. Bought career politicians serve their special interests by stifling innovation to maintain the status quo and by standing in the way of preserving the internet in order to sell access to the highest bidder. Bitcoin presents an opportunity for not only our district, but also for their families around the world. About 38% of New Yorkers in our district were born outside the United States and many of these families send money overseas. Our district’s median household income is 20% below the national average. Bitcoin presents an opportunity for less friction and significantly lower transaction costs for families and small businesses than traditional financial service outlets. Much like the promise of an open internet that changed the way that we communicate and do commerce around the world, this technology has the potential to do the same in the world of financial services.
Other campaigns around the United States have begun accepting Bitcoin. Kurzon is the first candidate to do so in New York.
