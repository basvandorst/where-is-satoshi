He does buy and sell to fiat, we both work for a bank and my team actually flagged him due to the large volumes of fiat going through the account. He actually got wholesale fx rates on his account due to the volume he was putting through

Maybe because the dips are always losses of larger value. 
$10,000 x 1.3 = $13,000. 
$20,000 x. 7 = $14,000
Make sense now? What's more exciting or painful, being up 3k or down 6k.
Simply answer yo

I work with a fellow who does exactly this, arbitrages between the exchanges. Bet his having a really good time this week

It's absolutely a thing and I personally know a guy making excessive dollars doing it. He runs bots feeling out the market and is never in a trade for longer than 30 mins. Pays up the fees to get the transaction confirmed but doesn't care cos he makes so much on the spread.
He cleared 70k aud this week

This has been answered time and time again. Bitcoin is the base funding currency for all other alts against usd.
If bitcoin goes down they all generally do too

It relates to new laws in Australia requiring exchanges to be registered. Individuals who accumulate funds on behalf of others is not allowed. If you wish to purchase bitcoin you still can.
The accounts being frozen are moving hundreds of thousands of dollars from generally cash deposited funds that flag up Due to the money laundering nature of the activity

Yeah I'm with anz to! Pretty sure nab and anz have some direct transaction channels on the back end, in the past the first transfer to nab would take 1-2 days it then subsequent transtions would be processed overnight!.
Having setup 2fa yet with them, moved all coins away simply due to that, to many stories of no 2fa and monies gone lol.

Yeah I've seen some bad feedback for coinjar on the sub but I think they just getting through thy teething stage of setting it all up, Def got no complaints with them though!.
Haha yeah that's it isn't it, there are places in Vic but I would need to go for a drive to get there, hopefully it starts picking up this year!

Based on his user name I would say trollo be his name

It's a cat.
Look up dead cat bounce on Google

Maybe cos of the 1000% gains this year, just saying that's a good reason to sell 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:24:02
Yeah jumping in to say this too. Do they  think wall St never traded a volatile product before? Hell volatility was once a thing in the markets before the central banks took care of most of it. Wall St is the volatility.

Disagree with 5.5k being the floor, expect selling to continue below the mean to really flush out the panickers, then a rip back to 5k. I'm targeting 3.8k-4.3k but won't be there for long.
Expect it to limp until after Feb futures expire.
The Vix does absolutely not control the price of cryptos. It's like me pulling up the murder rate vs declining internet Explorer chart. 
Correlation is not causation.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:22:01
It's Bonds leading stocks, with maybe a little bit of VIX and FX moves with China thrown into the mix.
Bitcoin is yet still a drop in the ocean compared to actual global financial markets, as far as bitcoin prices go, all its trying to do is have a look back at the mean, which is still lower.

Agreed, the just miss of 5k basically was the start of sellers territory. 2200-2500 is the new best value range going forward

Mr 64 bitcoin has been on the books through the whole range down to 3000 and back. I spent hours watching the DOM last night, but there was always 100 buy order about 60-70 bucks lower. Most likely the exchange having a very wide spread for larger liquidty risks. If you can get random large at markets orders hitting your bid/offer but then stablizes they can flip the fills or keep risk management in check.

Feels like the only way the VIX Is affecting bitcoins markets is by the way of bored volatility traders jumping on something that's volatile, because the last few Years markets have literally been dictated by volatility selling strategies, which appruptly unwound last night.
Bitcoins supply and demand is in fact based on the variety of other factors, which pass through and Inherently determine the supply/Demand of bitcoin itself. :)
