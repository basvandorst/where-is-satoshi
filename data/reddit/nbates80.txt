Not only expenses go up with inflation, so does people's income. So it is not useful to consider income and expenses on this discussion.
tomtomtom7's point is about the money each person has on the bank, not income and monthly savings.
The middle class man will have saved 8400$ last month, but if there is a 10% inflation now he can buy something that last year costed 7637 (since in one year that thing's price will have increased by 10% due to inflation)
As for the poor guy: he will have saved 600$ in one year, which will be as if he had 545 last year in terms of what things he can buy now. But if he is poor he probably can't save anything (as you said "50 a month, if that") so inflation doesn't depreciate his savings since he doesn't have any.
They both will have their income, expenses and monthly savings (if they had any savings) increased by 10% each year. But if you had savings, your savings will decrease year by year.

I think what parent means with "shilling snake oil" is that the people that already owns bitcoin is trying to convince people like us (I'm Argentine too) to save their money in BTC (instead of USD) hoping they can cash out. The reason is that lately BTC has been in a downtrend, mostly because people who bought in expecting it was going to go back to 1000USD/BTC like last year is now selling.
So, I would say he means BTC is a bad purchase vs buying dollars.
Also, I think parent is a troll. So, while I agree he is a douche I think (as an Argentine) that he has a point. Why buying a very fluctuating currency like BTC instead of saving your "hard earned wealth" in more tried-and-true currencies like USD (illegally, yes) or other investments?

Well... many people believe that if these places are not raided is because they know what strings to pull to avoid that. I don't usually hear about these places being raided. In any case I don't think government cares about this too much (long to explain but I think government is ok with people buying dollars illegally as legal dollar is heavily subsidized, so it saves the government money)
The cave I use existed for years now and never had any problems.

The problem I see with Argentina and BTC is that people already buys dollars to escape the crisis. It is easier, available (buying dollar blue is very easy really) and well known. BTC is another unknown to add to the equation.

Why would you want to store your savings online? I'm not talking about bitcoins for day to day use but savings.
I don't see the point of it. If you plan to save money for more than year, storing it physically is an option.

Just to expand on what you said. The official peso is a real*ish* rate too. If you buy anything with a credit card you get that rate (+35%, but still cheaper than blue dollar).
This means that to me it is much cheaper to buy things using my credit card than using bitcoins or dollars (just sell the bitcoins and dollars on the black marcket and use that money to pay my credit cards)
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:25:50
Argentine here. I don't think buying bitcoins is that hard as there are people selling it on localbitcoins, several forums, fb pages, etc. There are even miners (as electricity is quite subsidized). Never bought bitcoins yet.
However, it is not hard to buy dollars either if you are willing to pay the black market rate (which is also the rate you pay if you are buying BTC).
If the idea is saving, buying dollars in the black market is easier, provides more liquidity (specially if you don't live on the country's capital city) and less spread. 
Many people is also opening offshore accounts in Uruguay and using that account for savings or for international transfers (a trip to Uruguay now and then is quite cheap). That's completely legal.
Other people transfer money through illegal entities (called 'caves') that, ironically, charge less than a bank.
Argentine have great ingenuity when it comes to circumvecting laws. Many of the ways we have are simpler than BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:24:23
Assuming you know how to get bitcoins in the first place and that you want to get out of the country in the second. 
Most people just buys dollars, and hide them "under the mattress" until they can use it for vacations, expenses, etc. Even in the case of vacations and buying stuff, it is better to use credit cards abroad and then pay them in pesos at official rates in Argentina. If you do that and sell your dollars at blue rates you get a 20% discount in all your purchases (official rate+35% fee/blue rate = 0.806 at the moment)
In my case, I buy dollars and sell them as I need the ARS for regular expenses and investment. Even if I could I wouldn't put all my money in BTC and keep it there, that's a risky investment strategy.
So yes, if you just want to flee the country with a huge amount of money (over 10 thousand dollars) that you can't account for, BTC is good.

Inflation, if you consider monetary theory to be true, is just the depreciation of money. That is relative to everything, including workforce.

I would say service businesses that sell services from Arg to the world.
Exporting businesses are different because they still have to go through a lot of controls to ship the goods. AFIP wants to know exactly how much is being sold, central bank wants to convert the incoming USD to ARS at official rates. I don't see how would they justify shipping a lot of stuff abroad without getting USD in return.
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:08:25
Sorry, local lingo. "Cuevas" or "Caves" is an illegal currency exchange. It's the place where you go to buy/sell dollars without government control.

It is not far fetched. The outsourcing company I work for does exactly this:
- Developers offer services to US companies
- US companies pay to this company on the US in USD
- Company sends USD from US to Arg through illegal means (caves)
- Sells some of the USD at blue market fees, use the rest to pay some of its developers
- Use ARS to cover for expenses
I do something very similar with my own clients:
- Get paid in Canada for my development services
- Person in Canada wires my money to an account in a fiscal paradise
- I fly across the country to buenos aires, go to a cave, hope they don't screw me and give me the money I transfered (didn't have any problem in years of bussiness)
- Come back to my home with USD
- Sell my USD when I need ARS
BTC could replace the illegal means, expenses, fees, etc. Problem is that there is not enough liquidity AFAIK and I don't think we could manage to get a consistent flow of ARS (ironically). That is, if I got BTC it would be hard for me to get ARS when I need them (with USD I just go to the exchange house and they gladly offer ARS at blue rates for my USD)
This could change if more people started saving in BTC
**TL;DR: in both cases there is a big income in USD in US and expenses in ARS in Arg, but no ARS income since we have no clients in Argentina.**
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:15:36
I don't know if USD is safe on the long run but I know BTC is risky on the short run. I could end up on a situation where I need to hold BTC just to recover the value it had initially.
So even storing BTC before I find investments can be very risky. But I don't think storing USD while I find investments is very risky as I'm sure US government will do a lot to keep the price of the USD stable as much as they can.
So, I'm not saying you should buy USD and store them for retirement 30 years from now. I'm saying you should buy USD and use that to build a shares, bonds portfolio and other investments (physical investments like gold, real estate, etc). The stability of the USD allows you to move the money in a predictable way without rushing. If you were to do the same with BTC (leaving aside the problem of buying shares, bonds, and physical stuff with BTC) you would have to worry about volatility while holding BTC.

I did some research using localbitcoins and at the moment it is HIGHLY COSTLY to transfer money from Canada to Argentina using bitcoins vs using a cave. 
If I buy BTC in Canada and sell in Argentina I can get 10.11 ARS for each CAD (for the amounts I need to transfer), while if I use a cave I can get 12.12 ARS from each CAD (including commissions).
Plus, it seems there is much less liquidity than less year.
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:11:02
This is not about being right... it is about people knowing about this.
When I say "inflation" in Argentina, people don't think about USD inflation, they think about ARS inflation. Most people is not even aware there is inflation in USD. The main concern people has right now in Argentina is getting away from ARS inflation, this can be achieved by buying USD, stocks, goods, etc. So as long as they can get USD easily enough, they will be ok. 
People seeking BTC have to be financially savvy enough to understand that BTC could be a better bet on the long run but not financially savvy enough to understand that putting all your eggs in a BTC basket is a lousy investment decision.

He probably buys abroad. E.g. you charge for a service in usd, but get paid in btc so you can transfer, then sell btc locally.

OP said "over 50%" I only said the actual value (about half of what op said). It is not a rebuttal for "suffering from inflation" but for the actual figure.
I'm not denying inflation or its actual value. Now, if you want to say we are suffering from over 10000% daily inflation go ahead.

Is there something like Kickstarter but accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:57:38
I don't see why. Buying bitcoins do not have a surcharge but you pay a much more expensive dollar exchange rate (same as black market exchange rate). 
If you have cc it is still less expensive to pay the surcharge (1 dolar is about 8 pesos after cc surcharge, and about 10 pesos if you use bitcoin). And... the 35% gets refunded on fiscal year end (either as an income tax deduction or an actual cash deposit on your bank account).
btc is a great alternative if you don't have cc, because buying dollars is restricted (and you probably don't want to go to the black market). But that didn't change with this new measure.
The real problem is that the free exchange rate is about 10 pesos and is supposed to increase. That's mainly due to monetary emission. But this 35% increase rate is only the government trying to maintain an artificially low exchange rate (keep in mind that this 35% does not apply to companies importing goods) that no free market is able to match.

a) I don't need to give you a proof that I got a refund. I won't disclose my bank account information to prove a point on the internet. Just search Clarin and La Nacion, there are no articles about the surcharge not being refunded afaik, if that was the case I have no doubt that the two main opposing newspapers would report that.
b) I never denied the existence of government paid shills. Just denied to be one.
You know what? Maybe I'm a government shill and the refund was the government way of paying me!

May be, but harder to exchange. Remember Argentina != Buenos Aires
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:56:43
I think about this as follows. Consider two extreme cases:
* Case A. BTC is money 2.0: There is enough people interested in using BTC as a means to an end (the end could be transferring value or just purchasing). Then:
More goods and services available =&gt; More people interested =&gt; BTC increases value =&gt; deflation =&gt; investors get wary =&gt; less goods and services available =&gt; less people interested =&gt; BTC decreases value =&gt; inflation =&gt; people start using their btc to generate value =&gt; more goods and services available =&gt; etc
Which means there is one "stable point" in between. 
* Case B. BTC is gold 2.0: People uses BTC as an investment, expecting to cash in.
BTC price increases at a rate **R** greater than other investments =&gt; People get interested =&gt; More people buy BTC =&gt; BTC price keeps rising faster =&gt; people don't have any capital left to invest =&gt; BTC prices increase less than other investment alternatives =&gt; people starts cashing out =&gt; BTC value decreases =&gt; BTC value becomes interesting again\* =&gt; People start buying =&gt; BTC prices increases =&gt; etc
(\* Does it?)
Now... let me explain why I think we can't have case 2 forever even if we are there at the moment:
People will only see BTC as an interesting investment while the yield rate (for that risk) is greater than R, the yield rate for other investments with similar risk. So that seems to be a stable point. However, keep in mind that R is not a price but a first derivative of price over time. So it is not a stable point UNLESS the economy can generate enough value  as to keep BTC price from saturating, which seems unlikely considering people is investing on BTC instead of investing on things that generate value (as per this case assumption!). 
It would be great to have a mathematical toy model to simulate how case A and case B would interact. But my gut feeling is that there should be an overal stable point with rate R from case B being a measure of the value generated by case A.

Because minimum wages have increased over inflation for the past 10 years. 
Inflation has only become a problem the past few years since salaries are starting to lag behind. 
But also, check out the historic inflation figures 
I remember being young on a country with 3000% inflation (around 1990) and it wasn't nice :)
So yes, I think the government is dropping the ball on this and inflation is becoming a problem. This surcharge is the government trying to keep an artificially low exchange rate (for imported goods mainly) and at the same time expanding monetary base and keeping foreign-exchange reserves up. 
Something's gotta give, I hope we don't end up on another big crisis like in 2001.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:06:50
As a recomendation, bring dollars. You'll be given a much (MUCH) better exchange rate than using cc if you take some time to find somebody who changes you.

A better system would be the government to ask you to pay for "cops, fire fighters, ambulances, roads, military" also pavement, infrastructure, etc.
If you don't agree, you can't use any of that. You get robbed? Bad for you. House on fire, too bad. Want to go from point A to point B? Pay your neighbour to let you dive your SUV through their property. Etc.
The good thing about that system is that everybody would "opt in" and we wouldn't have to hear childish complaints.

I don't "think". I got refunded last year so I "know".

There're many definitions of fair. In my definition, a fair system would guarantee that a person who's poor because he didn't have luck would still have enough to live. It would also guarantee you can't get money without working for it as long as there is people working for it and not getting it. 
For some other people, having some randomly selected rich guys is fair. Of course they have to use words like "risk" or "foresight" to make it sound fair, because they like to think there MUST be something inherently superior in those who got lucky.
@_date: 2013-08-06 17:23:44
Yes. You only need to declare if you are bringing more than 10,000 USD (iirc). And of course, if you are Argentinian you have to show you paid taxes for this. I believe this is common practice on many countries. 
But generally speaking, turists are already doing this. However, take into consideration that places like hotels will charge you in USD and if you ask to pay in pesos (the only legal way of paying for goods and services in Argentina) they will convert the amount to the "dollar blue" rate, so you end up with no earnings.
Also, many turist services are already increasing their fees.
In any case, you'll have it easier selling USD at free market rates than selling bitcoins. 
One good reason to use BTC instead of USD is security.

The problem I see with that is copyright laws legislate about things that are mostly virtual and can be exchanged online without caring about real world laws. On the other hand, bitcoin is a virtual currency but you still need to buy real things like houses, cars, food. That leaves papertrail and you will eventually have to pay taxes for that.
