That is correct

While that's all possible, we are focused on creating a secure identity. We are not interested in creating a more elaborate network as you described, but that is an interesting concept

What is your passport idea?
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:44:31
There is no central company to verify, only a public key. The project is open source, so can be modified to fit your needs, but let me see if I can clear some things up. The demo was made in a short time, I know its not perfect, we aren't good at shooting video.
The QR code points to your information on the blockchain. We create all the IDs and sign them with a private key to ensure there are no fakes, but we have no information of any user. All we do is sign, otherwise anyone could make an ID, which would make fakes possible. Now back to the blockchain. The QR code points to the location of a cluster of entries, which our software, or a software you build can use our public key to verify which are legit and which are not. The encrypted information stores all the info on the card INCLUDING your picture and some information not on the card. This means if you scan it somewhere, not only is it verified as a legit QR, but you can see if the rest of the information matches the information coming up.
To get verification you need, the card, the password, and
(optional) a fingerprint. 
The whole "consolidate" thing is a result of our system. If 2 companies use the same system, why create 2 IDs? We could create you 2 or 3 with different looks and say its your store X and store Y, but why not just use 1?

No, Factom. See Factom.org

Interesting idea. As of now no. If you lose your password there is no way to recover the ID. This is an issue, but there is 1 benefit to that, no one has access to your ID except you. Companies/clubs/groups/anyone with memebers doesn't need to store any information to verify their users, just the code on the barcode. (We also have a more secure unique ID inside the encrypted data, but atm it just serves as a private identifier). 
So write down your password! But your idea is interesting and we will look into it, the project is young and we aren't sure where to go with it.

School ID systems is one of our inspirations to do this project actually. So I apologize if the wording caused confusion, but you should know the context. This project was constructed for a competition and judged by technical judges in the decentralized industry, so all of our current information is with that in mind. We were referring to the **potential** in the video, as that is what our intended audience was interested in.
Before this reddit post, that was our only audience. I am glad you are here though, and let me answer your questions. First, our company isn't as active in the process as you may think. We as Cryptid can only issue IDs, meaning that once we give you our software (which is open source and you can download it today if you want), you can verify any ID that we have made or will make in the future. So any ID you made is permanent, but we have constructed methods to allow for changes, but all the originals are still accessible. 
To answer your questions:
1) If we fold, no new IDs can be issued unless we give our private key to a new issuer, which would be the case if we had customers. 
2) No IDs will be lost if we cease to exist. No changes need to be made, all existing IDs will continue to exist as we store no information, and all these IDs can still be verified.
3) Another company can easily take over, all we need to do is give our private key to someone else.
4) The software currently available is all the software we have to issue and verify IDs. Meaning customers do not need us to verify, and the software is already out there to take over.
I hope that helps answer your questions, and the price point of 5 cents is for issuing an ID. The QR can be stored on anything, but what it is stored on may cost additional (like the physical plastic piece).
Please feel free to ask any other questions, I'd gladly help explain anything further

Also cards will be able to be flagged as "compromised", so if your card has been compromised a new one can be issued, and the both IDs know of all other IDs under your name. This means you don't need to tell every company that uses Cryptid of your new ID, instead your new one will work at any location that accepted your old one, but the old one will not work. Hope that clears up some of the security aspects
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:34:02
That was a big inspiration. We've done a lot of research on many forms of identification and how they prevent counterfeiters, but we've come up with a much cheaper solution. I'd hope school systems took advantage of our system as the current student IDs have no security
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:37:55
It's not an encrypted private key. It's a location to the data on the Factom blockchain.
Edit: the data is signed by Cryptid's private key to ensure validity. The data is encrypted with the user's password. Also, it uses fingerprint verification as well, not demoed in the video. The ID has 3 factor verification
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:49:10
Are you referring to keeping it in coin or the discount? Just curious on what you are referring to
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:19:46
Thank you sir!
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:14:00
Saw this too late damn
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:33:46
I see, I don't really have another computer to use unfortunately, but I do have an OS on a flashdrive... I guess I'll go for it. Thank you for the PhotoRec link!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:26:03
SecretEmperor said to remove my hard drive. Must I do that or can I just run PhotoRec on the current computer with the hard drive? (Btw im posting from my laptop, the PC hasn't been used in months)
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:21:49
10% is more than enough to try with $5000 dollars on the line haha
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:37:21
Will do =)
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:33:07
I see why you'd think that but It recovers all files. Even made an update for bitcoin wallets =) I just wasn't sure what the file type would be
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:15:12
I am currently using photo rec, I hope it proves well, if not I'll look at sending it to a company, but I'll take a crack at it first :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:34:00
The computer was wiped, so using Photorec to search for it. I have over 1000 files now, so removing the excess will help haha
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:40:52
I told reddit my story on how the computer was wiped, and there is a possibility the wallet file was not overwritten over the years (small but possible). They directed me to photo rec. Photo Rec is spitting out my hard drive and everything on it to my external which im looking through every now and then
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:14:01
Ohhh is that the type? Thank you =)
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:19:26
If its time... I'm screwed. Ubuntu was installed ~a year ago. But probably less than a gb has been downloaded on it since, so i was hoping it wasn't overwritten
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:21:11
Sorry, not to savy when it comes to hardware. Why install it on another computer? Can i run PhotoRec on the one its currently installed?
