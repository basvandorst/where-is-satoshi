Yeah I also agree it’s a little funny.  A lot of trump voters have also pledged their vote for Yang. Wonder how this election will turn out

Trading stocks are stupid. Its a lot more riskier considering the volatility but that also makes it a lot more rewarding. The average individual trading on the stock market loses. 
You don’t have to trade away all your bitcoin on a trade either, so you don’t miss out on the next boom

in all seriousness though theres a lot of problems that bitcoin has, that bitcoin cash solves. I completely agree with you but I think it will be bitcoin cash that will be the way huge bullish long term one!
