Edit: should flesh it out a bit. "Simply how the system works" is not really saying much. The system has been designed by people like him to promote people like him... so, yeah. 
Being elected PM by your own party without any public say in the matter is undemocratic and - moreover - when it happened with Gordon Brown, Johnson was outraged and foamed at the mouth against it. 
So there's that.

It's not but there is a strong correlation between racism and Islamophobia. 
Most normal people are rightly condemning of Islamism and scum like Daesh. But most normal people also don't see these maniacs as equalling to Islam. 
Those that DO think that Daesh are synonymous with Islam are uneducated on the matter and highly likely to be uneducated on other matters such as race and gender too. 
So you could say that most sane people realise that 1.6 Billion Muslims aren't a threat because if they were we'd all be dead by now - and the irrational ones who see all these 1.6 as a threat are not racist to do so.
But they very likely ARE racist for other reasons.

Not exactly true. If you had a halal loan for your business - say20k - then the 'fee' would be an agreed percentage of profit. 
So if you made 1$M then you'd pay X%. If you made $2 you'd pay the same X%. If you lost money and went bust you'd pay the loan plus some agreed fee. 
Seems fairer than a fixed percentage on the sum regardless of success of failure. The idea is the the lender shares in your success/failure rather than exploits you regardless of either turnout as is now in the West.

Meh... there are racists out there. It's a thing. Even quite popular. 
99.99999999% of them hate Muslims too. 
Personally I think it's because they're pussies and not like the old Nazis they so much admire - they can't stand up and say "I'm a racist suck it up byatch".... they have to obfuscate. 
And because - as you so germanely point out - Muslims are not a race then it's a great place to transfer all the hate and not have to nail the racist colours to the mast. 
And of course it's allowed and even encouraged to hate Islam so it's win-win. Probably even validates their petty existence on some level... might only be the only acceptance they have into society even.

Well, the 'truth' aspect is worse than grating. I wasn't really referring to that. I am not a Christian but as a religious studies academic I can assure you Dawkins is embarrassing in his pronouncements on religion. He basically knows nothing at all about current thinking or any development in theology in the last 50 years. Which is fine... just don't go in that arena to debate then. 
It would be like me - who knows nothing of biology - writing a book critiquing Dawkins life-work in that field. You just would not do it. Academically I am talking now... not in terms of belief. 
It's a bit embarrassing. At least Dennet has some philosophy.

You could get round it by publicising the public key so people could deposit coin maybe. Then the price might rise quite a lot and people would wait to purchase it. 
The KLF did something similar back in the day with some of the money that would become the $1M they burnt. They put $500,000 (GBP actually) into a perspex sealed container and put it on sake for $250,000.
The idea was that as a work of art it might rise - making a point about silly prices for conceptual art - presenting any potential purchaser with a dilemma; cash in for 100% profit straight away by smashing open the case and destroying the artwork or hold for possible potential high gains down the line and resell as an artwork, possibly for millions.
Seems an analogue for crypto in many ways.

No, but then I don't think fighting Nazis = terrorism. It didn't in the 1930s - though Nazis said it did - and it sure as hell doesn't now.


Not so much but then again, as I said, they fought the Nazi scum in WW2 and are pretty much the reason you can give it large now in the name of your 'freedom'. Freedom 'the Commies' won for you. From Nazis.

Yeah, that's blasphemy which is not strictly criticism of Islam but of God. It still sucks, don't get me wrong - it's not from the practice of Muhammad either. They can't trace it back. 


Not sure. It depends on the culture I guess. I'm not a big fan of laws and control. But I am forced into a bit of an elitist position on this, which I don't like.
I think everyone should have the right to 'shout fire in a crowded theatre' but I also think that - ideally - no-one would. 
Seeing as we're living in a time when many people demand the right to do this and fully intend to do it I think they need to be restrained somehow. 
Back to Islam as an example. I think blasphemy laws need to go and that the extremists who enforce (wrongly - but it doesn't matter whether they are right or Wong if they're enforcing) stoning or killing for criticising certain things are scum who need to go. 
BUT that doesn't mean I feel the urge to go and do the very thing that will make them pissed off. Why would I do that? It's not actually countering them or working against them. It's just juvenile. But that's where we're at right now so we need to stop somehow idiots from acting out. Until they grow up.

Yep. Pretty much the entirety of Gab's demographic. It's essentially the go-to place for scum who've been banned everywhere else. 


That is a problem but not one that is operative much in this case. Not much difficulty seeing the haters on Gab as that's their main lair. They are all corralled in one place and it's pretty obvious from what they say what hate is. 
I really don't think one needs to debate what violence is - you kind of know it when you see it. 


Not aware of any Islamic country that does this for criticism of Islam *per se*. If they do then it's against Islam itself so I guess they'd not be Islamic in a way. Saudi I can imagine might have some stringent laws but not for criticising Islam in the abstract. I'd class many Saudi/Wahabi speeches as hate-speech too though.

You do not factor one thing into your analysis: many people are getting more and more pissed off with 'the system'.
They express it in different ways: antifa, Trump-voters, Brexit loons, alt-right, Socialist resurgence. And that's just on the end of the political spectrum. You can do the same analysis across religious and other demographics. People have had enough.
There is no 'normal' anymore and your concept of the general public using crypto to buy things applies to the old 'normal' world-view. We are changing, things are falling apart. 
Sure Government is panicking - but not because they fear Crypto, because *things are falling apart*. What they fear is what happens **After** that - when they have lost control.
Crypto can be a big part of that 'next thing', a new world if you will. Hell, some of us even want to make it happen but if you think that things are 'business as usual' and see Crypto and Government response in that context then I think you're maybe not seeing the big picture.

@_date: 2017-10-28 17:09:31
I agree with you man - 100%. But those are the exact reasons I can't support this Independence drive *by these people* in charge right now. 
It's exactly as if a Francoist offshoot started opposing Franco because they weren't allowed to be part of the inner Cabal so they start agitating for a new movement that does indeed oppose Franco but is founded on exactly the same ideals.
You won't find a more money/capitalist/banking nation than Catalunya. It's almost their whole raison d'être. This is what it's all about - tax and money. There is nothing about freedom in this... no matter how much they say it. 
For years their Chamber of Commerce has (literally) been in Tel Aviv. Israel trains the police (just like in the US and the end results down the line will be the same for the same reasons) - if you think there is anything remotely radical about any of this I have some shitcoins to sell you. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:46:26


Not really. I take my ideology from only one side though. Perhaps you mean that. 


The same place it was when those Allied extremists invaded Normandy in WW2. The same place it was when the extremists of the Jewish Resistance had that extremist-hatefest back in the day. Same place it is when any 'extremist' stands up for justice.
I get the feeling you didn't quite absorb my points about black/white binary thinking. 


Feelings can be unreliable! Be careful! ;)
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:24:50
True. Some people like the Kurds and Palestinians need self-determination and freedom but if you stack up the Catalans in the same order-book it kind of looks sketchy: the wealthiest people wanting more money. 
Also you need to factor in the bigger picture with players behind the scenes wanting to break up Europe. Russia has a hand in this and Israel is a major backer.

Don't get me wrong, I'm with you there but the thing is this 'New State' they want is no different than any existing State... they just want their own version of the existing crapolas. That's because of their Nationalism. 
If they predicated it on something *other* than Nationalism it could fly maybe. 
I'd be right behind it if they wanted to do something new and radical but the argument is essentially 'we need our snouts in the trough too' rather than 'let's break up the trough and start something completely new'.
Basically just right-wingers without power wanting more power and more money and more influence to join the Neoliberal circle-jerk. Ain't no way I'm supporting that. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:41:59
You do not factor one thing into your analysis: many people are getting more and more pissed off with 'the system'.
They express it in different ways: antifa, Trump-voters, Brexit loons, alt-right, Socialist resurgence. And that's just on the end of the political spectrum. You can do the same analysis across religious and other demographics. People have had enough.
There is no 'normal' anymore and your concept of the general public using crypto to buy things applies to the old 'normal' world-view. We are changing, things are falling apart. 
Sure Government is panicking - but not because they fear Crypto, because *things are falling apart*. What they fear is what happens **After** that - when they have lost control.
Crypto can be a big part of that 'next thing', a new world if you will. Hell, some of us even want to make it happen but if you think that things are 'business as usual' and see Crypto and Government response in that context then I think you're maybe not seeing the big picture.

I think people are scared to stand against Independence. Or have been - is changing now. Hundreds of thousands in the street against it Sunday. 
Another thing I wanted to point out though: most people in Crypto seem to be 'against the Man' as it were and seem also to be supporting the Catalans in some mistaken view that this lines up. It doesn't. 
The Catalan government and the whole independence movement are not about change. They are about JOINING 'the Man'. They are pissed off they have not had their slice of pie and their 'rights'. They don't want to CHANGE their rights or the system.
It would be exactly as if the people in this sub decided they wanted to 'sock it to the man' and oppose centralisation not by getting into Crypto but by protesting for their rights to join the boards of the Big Banks and using arguments that show how they've been excluded from the big money. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:08:13
I mean there will be essentially two societies - one for the rich/elite and one for those that don't meet the benchmark they define. Which could be a financial benchmark, a political one or an ideological one or combination. 
As it is now we have one society and our thinking is that we can progress in it if we work hard and rich/poor, left/right, people of all views exist within this system. I think the elite will split off - are doing that if you really examine it - and make their own. It will separate.

@_date: 2017-10-31 11:06:09


That's not my logic. My logic is yes, they have the right but I don't support it and I've given my reasons. 
Look at it this way, say a US State wanted to secede then - if they attempt it legally, unlike the case here - then I would support their right to try it (like I support the Catalans 'right'. actually there are no such rights - to try it) but if they were Neo-Nazis or even just vanilla Right-wingers who wanted a Right-wing state on the lines of a Trumpian envisaged Utopia then I would oppose it on the grounds it goes against my views. That is my right also. 
Also how do you fit in the majority (latest polls) of Catalans who DON'T want the right to choose at all and are happy with the way things are? Why should a minority have the 'right' to enforce their views to the extent that they feel it necessary to break the law?
Something similar happened in the UK last year where a bunch of right-wing Nationalists living in the past enforced decades of failure and lack of hope on a younger generation who unanimously rejected their vision and the lies and propaganda it was based on. What about their rights? Sweet FA I guess.

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:28:14
I don't think it will help tbh. Probably there will be more chaos re other  Independence movements. It's presented now as Catalunya as a whole but that's a kind of stalking horse. There are other regions in Catalunya itself who will want some autonomy if they get Independence: the Balearics, Valencia etc. Even the French Pyrenees region will get drawn in. That will bog things down for a long time. 
Also then other regions like the Basques and areas of Italy and Eastern European areas will be emboldened and Europe could disintegrate... that's probably what they're banking on because there's no way they will be in the EU ever if it goes through. Already 40% of businesses have left Catalunya so many more will. 
I can't see any Crypto solving any of it tbh but who knows.

Yes I do. Having lived in Barcelona for 20 years and seen daily the censoring and eliminating of any non-Independence discourse it's not something I can support. The fact that Rajoy is a scumbag fascist really doesn't get the Catalan fascists off the hook. 
There's two things I can't accept in this world:
1) Racism and Nationalism. And you bet this is both. 
2) Reductionist non-thinking. 
You need to look into this deeper. I could school you on the political discourse behind this but you should do it for yourself. Suffice to say this: the only difference between Rajoy and Puigdemont is nationality. Their politics is the same and here's another clue: it sure as hell ain't left-wing in either case. That might fly for you but for me and Catalans who fought Franco it's a non-starter.

Very naive view. This is the view of all reductionists btw: if you oppose something you must be its opposite. 
Of course those elites oppose someone else joining their ranks. Because that someone else **WANTS** a slice of the pie. WANTS to become part of the elite. 
By your logic if someone is so greedy they want to join the Greedy Club and the Greedy Club is so greedy they don't want them to then this means the applicant is not greedy at all. In reality they are the same. Dog eat dog. 
So I don't have to show you anything other than something you can't see: Scumbags not in the Scumbag club want to join the Scumbag club. 
Nevertheless I will just leave this here:
**In favour:** Zionists




**Against:** Anti-Francoists:

All true but the thing is that the plan may actually BE to break up Europe. And if that happens it might not be a good thing... for sure the people behind the plan don't have the interests of ordinary people at heart.
@_date: 2018-07-06 10:03:47
They are in a way excuses but the plan is a wider vision that goes back to Middle East wars post-911 and is geopolitical in nature. You're right that the plan is a final division between rich and poor where the rich finally pull up the drawbridge and sail off in their ark. Perhaps literally if they get off-planet in the next 100 years or so. 
The main problem - from the pov of a non-elite member actually stopping this or escaping the consequence - is that all the modalities used to bring about this final division of rich/poor have been designed to actually *get the victims to be the prime movers in their own extinction* and hence to defend it to the death. It's not just turkeys voting for Xmas - it's turkeys forming a highly armed crack militia with the sole objective of protecting the abattoir with a shoot to kill policy for vegetarian activists. 
Brexit would be a classic example: benefits no-one except the elite who will become hugely richer. Working Class people - who voted for it, would do again and are the most vociferous supporters - will be screwed. No more free healthcare. Spiralling living costs. Wages plummeting. None of it gives them pause for thought now and will not do when it kicks in. Defend it to the death. 
So that's what you face. Also in crypto there is a parallel issue. Some form of crypto may well be the means the rich use to start their 'New Era' while all the while Libertarians keep bleating about how it's 'our thing'. Meanwhile the whales manipulate and accumulate. We have our turkeys too. 
I would counsel anyone who really believes the system is dead and dying (and it is - the discussion is really about who is killing it and to what end, as you point out) to **REALLY** abandon it. Wholesale. And to think of solutions pretty quick. Imo - but could be wrong - it's kind of pointless to think of crypto as something that will help you 'win' in the system (i.e. pension pots or lambos or however you want to conceive it) because the system won't be there very soon. Or rather it will but you will be locked out of it. 
Time to start making your own system. We're in a unique and amazing place here, we don't need alternatives because there are none - but once the elite have fucked off to their own playground locking you out you'll be able to start again from nothing - to make your own thing. Not as an alternative to anything - just an expression of you. We can each do that: intentional communities. This is a once in a civilisation chance to start over, we'll be forced to anyway. 
I'd start thinking about that now. Could happen very quickly. I've been planning my own 'new thing' for a few years now and I think time is quickly running out by the look of things. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:09:44
Yep. They're fascists. That's what they do. 
My point is not that they are not scum. My points are these:
1) If a fascists kicks the shit out of another fascist it does not make the victim a Marxist
2) I have no dog in the fight between right-wing neoliberal loons who want their snout in the trough with the ruling elite right-wing neoliberal loons who are excluding them. 
3) All police everywhere would react the same. That's what police do. They don't rock up with bunches of lillies. Call an illegal vote for secession anywhere in the US, Germany or UK and see what happens. 
4)  applies also to Catalan police. I have seen on three separate occasions the Mossos - aka the Bastard squad - kick the living shit out of squatters and protestors. On one occasion I saw a Independence demonstrator in a wheelchair whacked with a baton and also rubber bullets fired on squatters several times. Often happens.

Maybe it sounds like that to you. Luckily 'sounding like' to someone is not a benchmark of fact.  I don't know. My view is just a version of "I don't like what you say but I will defend your right to say it" with the **"I don't like what you say"** bit underlined. 
Of course, for all I know, that might be what you object to and you feel I have to agree as well. Who knows?


Pretty much. But many people who opposed Hitler - Stalin for example - were also (re)branded as 'evil' by the US when needed. Same thing happened with the Taliban. 'Truth' is fluid and you're always one step away from the evil-basket. Catalans could easily be positioned there if they make a wrong step. Go against Israel and Corporatism or a Central Bank for example. Not that they will ever do that. 


Well, that's because they're right-wing quasi-fascists. But here's a clue: that does not make anyone they oppose their Polar Opposite by default. 


It sounds exactly like how a 'democratic' government would act. There is no country in the 'free world' who would tolerate the calling of a non-sanctioned election in favour of secession of a region. They would ALL send in police to stop it and from there it's a lottery whether it all kicks off. It's kind of what police do. Especially militarised ones. 
Btw, do you have any opinion on the activities of the Barcelona Catalan police (the Mossos - aka 'Bastard Squad') and their behaviour over the last 18 months which no-one seems to give a fuck about?
* 1) Closing down all anarchist squats by extreme force
* 2) Shutting down the protests by the anarchists and attacking them with batons
* 3) Firing rubber bullets at the crowds in the same instances over 3 nights
* 4) Smashing Independence protestors in wheelchairs with batons.
The above are the Catalan police btw. I have witnessed all the above incidents and they are well documented among left-wing and anarchist groups. Every incident is probably 10 times worse than the Spanish police incident - on their own people btw - and all not causing any outrage at all. 


I do know actually. Here are the reasons:
* 1) Legitimised Islamophobia since 911 compounded by Governmental failure to combat racist groups who equate Islam with terrorism across the board.
* 2) Capitalisation on the situation by Dominionist Christians in US political lobbies
* 3) Sheep like UK and Western administrations ass-licking the US following them in the previous point
* 4) More ass-licking to the Saudi/Israeli axis for oil/money
Add to this the kicker: A non-questioning binary-reductionist mindset among the consumers of 'news'. We have "Rebels GOOD - Asad BAD" and now the same with Catalan/Spain. I can prove this actually because every time I say something like this I am a 'supporter of Rajoy'. The reality is though, why can't both be wrong? Why can't both be the same?


I don't do emotion. I've been diagnosed as lac king empathy so that kind of precludes it. Might be what you're picking up on. But here's a clue: I don't like right-wingers (I think you got that) but I kind of don't mention them when they're not there. Someone who hates spiders *might actually one time SEE a spider*. 


I brought up right-wing because Puigdemont leads a right-wing party that wants power to press ahead with its agenda. Fair enough. I'm just calling it like it is and saying I don't agree.

Yeah but the 'get a job or build capital' bit could fit better in less radical markets. Seems a bit myopic for this space if you catch my drift.

This is the one I am excited about:
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:40:35
I'm thinking the same. People do it though right? I'm not talking about day-trading, just grinding here and there over a given period. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:55:46
Is Cryptosteel dead? Been hearing reports of no answers to emails or contact over extended time.

Paid for what? Depending on that, Stripe does it. Make a simple web page and go with the free Stripe option. Fees might be high but you could check it out. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:55:01
I have some questions that aren't answered there
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:34:22
I guess they just need what they need on a standard sign-up. It won't be anonymous obviously but not sure how much authorising they do. I get the impression it's not much.

Transferwise: it's a borderless account Euro and GBP. 
Example fees:
British Pound	50p
Euro	0.60€
They actually used to do BTC too (iirc) I believe but stopped. Possibly they might start again in the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:23:57
But will it be the last time we hear from you?
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:18:16
They don't answer support mails, people are waiting months with no contact to be verified (me) and some people (not me as I'm put off trying it) claim to have problems withdrawing. 
None of that sounds good.
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:47:21
It always happens like this. For me anyway. Check your email and you'll see a confirmation mail - then just go back to the Dashboard and should be there.

@_date: 2017-07-02 12:38:08
Cool... thanks
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:57:38
Right. Loads of triggered lamers in the thread, I point them out and I'm the one amped up. 
Got ya. 
Not the best argument for your intellectual position. If you have one.

Personally I think this is inevitable. BTC and crypto will never be mainstream because they are oppositional. That is, they are a real/sane solution which is an alternative to irrational/insane non-solutions which are always - and inevitably - the mainstay of society. 
Society is structured that way to control the masses. It's not about empowering them so why would something that empowers them be adopted? 
Things like crypto are an alternative or escape from that control so, unless society changes radically or there's a worldwide revolution (clue: won't happen) there will always be a need for a counterculture. And that's where oppositional elements like crypto emerge from - which is also why they will never be mainstream. 
If BTC becomes mainstream then it means it has been co-opted and corrupted. So another solution will emerge to oppose it. 
I do think though that we're near to such a mainstream coin which - imo - will be used for a form of Universal Income. Probably first - and soon - in the EU. UK might even jump on it as a Brexit solution which is the first obvious application of it and why they are now talking about implementing Universal Income in the UK in the last few days. 
I suspect the Universal Credit infrastructure is also a test-bed to roll this out in the next few years.

So you could still go down with the ship then. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:49:08
I see what you did there. Smooth.
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:38:02
Not a bad idea but not sure if in this area huge wads of cash will be an issue!
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:47:57
Need more info. In the US I'd give probably it a miss. You never know who's an Ayn Rand fanboy there. 
But in Europe we'd - you know - just have a laugh.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:06:36


What is a small set amount?
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:25:09
Love it when Crypto Jocks think they are 'socking it to the man' when really they are just another bunch of right-wing breadheads in it for the cash. And no, I don't mean the OP but the Crusaders in the comments. 
Probably scared that if (when) Crypto does subvert the ruling elites they will go with it. 
You get the impression some of them would love to have been City Traders but didn't make the grade.

Recover them to their own wallet lol.
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:04:44
Can't we just shit talk? After all, none of us have any artistic ability. It's what we do....
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:26:20
Why is it on such a backlog and not shipping until Sept 4th? 
What will happen if I wait a few weeks to buy - get a sooner date, later date or stay the same?
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:16:39
why not?
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:08:04
ETA?
