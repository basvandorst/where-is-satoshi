Will I actually be able to read that post if I click or is it going to ask me for some bullshit BTC micropayment?
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:45:32
nice thematic post: 
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:00:05
ah yeah always tricky outside the us... though a canadian friend of mine mentioned being able to connect a credit card to circle and using that
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:05:47
congrats Oscr. you are doing the right thing for your posterity!

not sure what is up with this community bashing some of the easiest entry points into bitcoin like Coinbase and Circle.
it's like if you were to introduce someone to USD and say, "hey the best way to store your cash is under your mattress instead of at a bank. that way you have full control over your money."

Agree with I use Circle to buy BTC and move to my personal wallet
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:20:14
I had something similar happen to me. Circle helped me get it back quickly 
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:42:26
I've had two friends who ran into the same... ahem, issues with the user agreement.
Circle gave them time to remove all assets from the account before closing them. The tricky thing might be to get their attention during the July 4th holiday. Maybe email or tweet at them might work

Hands down easiest and fastest way to buy Bitcoin online with no fees. They let under 18 use the service as well, might ask you for some approval to access
@_date: 2016-02-16 04:11:10
Coinbase is a great service, but they really need to offer instant availability like circle.com. If you use a debit card to buy BTC off Circle, you get your BTC immediately
@_date: 2015-09-27 06:42:00
Circle. Their price is usually ABOVE market price, even when you sell BTC. So you're probably getting around 2% improvement over Coinbase. 
Coinbase spreads are just pretty ridiculous. Especially if their goal is to promote BTC as an everyday currency
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:22:41
Circle.com is instant. Connect bank account, credit or debit card. 
When I first signed up took me about 2 mins to buy and send BTC offline
@_date: 2015-09-19 02:05:37
LibertyX is great but I prefer Circle for the convenience. Why leave the house to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:01:33
This is a malicious move by Coinbase. It basically hurts other small start ups in the Bitcoin world by creating even more legal costs for them.
Even if Coinbase doesn't succeed with these patents, the small guys will have to spend all their money fighting this...
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:56:49
Hey coinbase, this is not cool bro. Many start ups in the Bitcoin ecosystem use these technologies in the same way you do. There is definitely prior art. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 11:05:37
Circle or Coinbase are the most credible. I find Circle easiest to use
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:38:44
what is the purpose of anything? vanity of vanities, says the preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity. what does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:57:23
Cool. Sounds extremely illegal. Good luck with the CFTC
@_date: 2015-10-01 05:53:40
FWIW I asked Circle support to increase my sending limits back up to where it used to be and it was granted with no hassle... Still pretty bad this happened with little warning
@_date: 2015-10-18 00:52:21
Business model based on violating money transmission laws in every jurisdiction in the world? Probably not going to fly
@_date: 2015-11-22 04:56:40
Interesting. If true, that means they're effectively lying to their customers when they claim free conversions between currencies. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 00:53:19
Must be hard finding employees/customers willing to go to jail for you
@_date: 2016-05-26 22:25:17
I sent my buddy in London BTC and he was able to cash out to GBP via circle.com. Seemed like an easy option.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:32:54
* Hanging out with friends? Now you can send and request money from people nearby. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 09:32:12
You realize you can now hold your balance in USD now right?
So you don't have to be exposed to volatility. 
Any BTC you move in is AUTOMATICALLY converted and locked to USD (at the price at the time that you send it). And YOU CAN DO THIS IN UNLIMITED SIZE. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:35:15
yeah man, i totally heard that the nsa uses cellphone gps to track people now as well... i guess we should live totally off the grid and stop using cellphones
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:58:31
not sure i follow... you're going to use your coins... to buy more coins?
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:41:20
yes you're right on all counts. merchant processing side of the bitcoin industry is in dire straits. why else would coinbase be diversifying into every possible cockamamie vertical they can come up with
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:12:04
cool -- looking forward to Coinbase shutting down merchant processing in favor of Bitpay and consumer wallet in favor of Circle
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:48:14
agree, Circle very easy way to get started
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:03:20
just curious, what happened with circle?
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:30:24
he's so incredibly wrong. surprising that wences would flaunt his ignorance so publicly
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:24:00
+1 for circle. works with credit and debit cards (be careful w/ some credit cards though that charge a 'cash advance fee', circle usually warns you if yours does).
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:46:28
aww man, bitcoin should be open to everyone...no matter the age
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:31:12
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:51:23
yeah how about a superbowl commercial already... damn it coinbase
