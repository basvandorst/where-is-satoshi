Also I'd recommend google 2-factor authentication. I didn't do it for a while because I thought it would be a major PITA but it really isn't that bad.

For transferring bitcoins, if dropbox works, I'd recommend truecrypt+dropbox to store it. If not if she has a friend who has some web space she could truecrypt it and store it there. Last case would be true crypt on a flash drive. For the super parinoid, a regular truecrypt volume+a hidden volume. That way if you are forced to decrypt it you can decrypt your normal one that maybe has some school work or something personal but not incriminating.

Apparently I'm not the only one who though your post deserved downvotes. 
And I didn't downvote you because I disagreed, I downvoted you because you didn't offer any explanation as to why you disagreed and thought it was a PITA. In fact, I haven't downvoted your comment above where you actually describe why you think it's a PITA though others have. Even though I disagree.

You're obviously doing something wrong then.

It takes less than a minute to generate a unique password for you device. Add password to device. WOW, what a major PITA that was.

I made the switch to [btcguild]( If mtred ever gets their act together I may go back but btcguild looks really nice and is pretty functional already.

better than mtred?

If I recall correctly, when the buyer goes to register the vehicle, if tax has not been paid on it, he will have to pay it then. If tax has been paid, you'll need to provide a receipt and I'd imagine find some way to give it to the government. Probably easier to not collect the tax and let him pay when he registers. You might want to provide a receipt for him for an amount in USD because otherwise I believe they will make him pay taxes based on the blue book value of the car.

Also there's [mt red]( which was setup by a redditor.

Or you could add something more to the conversation and explain why it was a PITA and then maybe I wouldn't downvote you. Instead it seems like you were just disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing. 
If you had to do that every time you wanted to check your email I'd agree it would be a PITA. Fortunately you only have to do it once. Not a big deal for the peace of mind and security it gives you in my opinion.

This is why I'm glad I use a different password on each site I register and I use google 2-factor auth logins.

I've mentioned this elsewhere in the thread but check out [mtred]( which was setup by a redditor.

You obviously haven't tried it. It's not because you setup random generated passwords for each app that doesn't support it. eg. I set one up for my phone. If something happens to my phone, I go in, disable that one password and nothing else is affected. 
So no, it's not a PITA.

Not really, I already have different passwords per site. It is based on the site but then a simple crypt is placed over it. (Ie, something like a=z) It's primarily so that someone looking at the pass would recognize it as unique to the site and instead it looks like a random password but it's easy enough that I can encrypt/decrypt it in my head. 
Also I use gmail's two factor authentication.
