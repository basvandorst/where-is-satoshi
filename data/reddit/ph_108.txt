Sounds like I should compare ML to the others.  Thanks

In no way am I attempting to discredit your comment.  Perhaps I should clarify my question/statement. 
I am aware you can swing trade.  
My revised question is, do other platforms exist for non-stock brokers and non-Wall Street earners,  other than Robinhood, that enable high frequency, quick liquidity, for FREE on each trade?

I noticed that too — it is similar with stocks.  If I set a limit, I set the limit based off the metrics on Yahoo Finance, and one more platform to confirm pricing and volume first. 
RH does admit that their actual indicators are still in the somewhat early stages and continuously being developed.  At the same token, we all have to eat.  
Did you notice COINBASE has the same BS with pricing? 
If you buy BTC on COINBASE, it is (I am 99% positive) $50-$100 more than actual market price.  If you sell directly from COINBASE app, it is $50-$100 less than market. 
I always transfer free from COINBASE to GDAX, set a limit order, pay no fees, and then send to another wallet from GDAX, not COINBASE.

Is there a less costly way to swing trade without taking your series 7?  
Edit:  $5 a trade is OK for long term if chosen correctly, BUT when I used one of those stock Brokerage services with fees and a broker, I received 10% YOY ROI.  
With Robinhood, my YOY ROI is currently 355%.

Robinhood as a whole allows you to buy, hold, sell.  Also has margin accounts.  Also, No Fees forever.  
They make money by the interest on your uninvested cash balance.  
That’s for stocks.  I’m not sure what it means to be “based around a HODL buy/sell via IOU.”  Do you mean Robinhood Gold?   Margin trading?

Agreed 100% - First World Problems.
Excellent response. 
Is it possible to really open this market, go on a bull run by getting second world (or third world) countries in the game?

You have a very good point and it sounds to me that you are speaking from experience, which I do not object.  
I use other platforms to perform the charting and multiple other resources.  Robinhood as you say does have some buggy scripts in it, which I won’t deny.  In my experience though, I have been able to do well with YOY ROI, and am not a licensed stock broker.   I 100% agree we need licensed stock professionals and their software.  In my situation, I perform better than expected without fees on RH.  
However, I do move my larger equities in stocks into more secured accounts with professionals watching it.  RH works well for small swings (under 20K), but undoubtedly cannot replace a real life, human expert.   
Your point well taken and I thank you for your input.
