Your understanding of FRDI bill is flawed. Check link below and on the right side you can see a box with "relevant links". 
Read chapters 4 and 12 to assess the facts and impact of bill yourself. 
Demonitisation was a year back. Its effect of huge influx of funds in banking system is more or less completed. 
Bitcoin and cryptoassets in general would grow manifolds in india in next few years. But it has little to do with FRDI bill or demonitisation or similar nonsensical logic as put forth by OP. 
Growth of cryptos in India has more to do with:
1) much higher speculative gains in short?!, medium and long term. 
2) Lack-lustre performance of other asset classes. 
3) Addition of new investors in large numbers to crypto investment community driven by past year's crypto returns, creating huge demand-supply mismatch. 
Downvoting the post as junk/spam post.

The core problem with fiat money is that intrinsically it has no value. Read the following articles from Wikipedia and also check suggested reading in the pages.

Try Bitbns or localbitcoins. Com
IMO: Take a breather, you may be feeling FOMO. The current rally seems more like a sprint rather than a marathon.
