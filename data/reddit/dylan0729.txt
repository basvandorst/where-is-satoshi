Newbie after Thanksgiving here. Only put what I could afford to lose, so I'm not hurting too bad. Yeah, it sucks to see it dip (I've put about $270 into BTC that's only worth like $200 now), but I have faith it'll rise again.

If I sold right now, I'd have made $60 while I slept. Not as much as some, but more than minimum wage workers make per day! It's a start!
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:04:44
Nope, good ol' US of A. US minimum wage is 7.25/hr. $60/8=7.5, or $7.50/hr.

Except... no. They "make" money by loaning you the amount and charging you interest, but the money they make off you doesn't come from nowhere; you earn it somehow, taking it from somewhere/someone else via wages or trading or whatever. And they got it from somewhere else. And they got it from somewhere else. Until eventually you go back to when it was first printed.
The only money creation is when you actually create bills or coins. Before that, it's just circulation.

No, the US. US minimum wage is 7.25/hr. $60/8=7.5, or $7.50/hr.

I mean, until relatively recently, it's mainly been used to make hard to trace illegal purchases. That much is true.

Unless you can manage a small loan of a million dollars, the best way I can think to learn that power is the mantra everyone keeps spouting.... "HODL."

So 260 days?

What about just buying and holding? That's not taxable at all, right?

Any transfer from one currency to another, be it altcoin to altcoin, altcoin to Bitcoin, Bitcoin to fiat, altcoin to fiat, or the reverse of any of those, has a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:33:34
Can't be taxed if you fire anyone who tries to tax you, just like you can't be prosecuted if you fire anyone who tries to investigate you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:40:45
Hell, why not?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:41:25
Not sure if I was supposed to reply to the comment or new one, so I did both.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:08:07
Put it this way: a hardware wallet would be worth more than I actually have in coin at the moment. That may not be true if it continues to rise, but it's true now.

You know Steam stopped accepting it, right?

Hey, noob here! I have a little in a wallet on Coinbase. I know how to move it to GDAX, but I have questions:
How do I move it to a wallet offline?
What's a good wallet to move it to? Hoping for something free if possible; I put my Bitcoin budget into the btc already.
I have an old phone with no service I can put a wallet on via WiFi and delete the WiFi connection. Would that be secure? 
Would this move cost me any btc to do?
Is there anything else in general I should know?
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:03:48
Who else is gonna run a court? Corporations?
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:54:56
Put it this way: If you link someone CP, it's considered sharing it, even if you don't directly send them the file off your own hard drive.
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:12:58
Soooooo... If it has links to it, that's only a minor step away from it. And basically it seems like it's trying to say, "It has links to CP but NOT CP ITSELF SO IT'S OKAY" and I'm just like... There's gotta be something that can be done here, right?
Like... Don't get me wrong, not trying to fud the place up or anything, but this is a real problem that needs to be addressed, and trying to act like it's not is just gonna make Bitcoin and its supporters look bad and hurt adoption.

If I sell and make a profit, I have to pay capital gains tax. If I sell and lose, do I need to report anything?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:17:05
So even if I sell at a loss it's still income? That's crazy, considering overall I'd have spent money, not made it!
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:57:54
I don't really know how; I'm gonna be honest, most of the technical side of Bitcoin is totally over my head. I'm just acknowledging the need; it's not up to me to fill that need.
I just know this is a nightmare for Bitcoin, and the fact that anyone who runs a node will be downloading illegal data of one of the worst varieties will probably discourage people from doing so.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:12:26
But we ARE the market.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:05:09
It's trying... And it's not fooling anyone here, but it does fool people.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:34:43
Nah, they think those things should just happen for free without taxes, or be paid for by corporations who would for some reason care about your street lights. Not through taxation, nah, they want Coca-Cola and Microsoft to fight over who gets to give you street lights or rebuild your roads. Because that's how things work.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:36:34
If you're a small business, most likely you're in the red. Unless their electric bills, equipment costs, and employees can all be paid with BTC, they need to sell.

I have 2 hundredths of one. I'm broke as a joke.
