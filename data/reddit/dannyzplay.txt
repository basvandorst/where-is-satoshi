What a snowflake, get's triggered by a name then resorts to poor-shaming.

Should have sold it and put into XRB instead. You would have given your dad his original investment back and kept the exponential gains.

For those looking for an alternative I recommend binance.

Should have read their policy first.

I had heard about bitcoin in 2014 but always brushed it off as something insignificant until recently.  
  
I'm so mad about how much of an ignorant moron I was.

So things are supposed to get worse before they better?

LOL where is this from?

Shit I just recently got into it and have been kicking myself. Can't even imagine what some people are going through if they watched bitcoin grow from like &lt;$1.00

Always in a state of REGRET. Probably lost like 10 years off my life just thinking about it.

Which painting are you referring to?

Tomorrow it will be on sale for 3 dollars.

I only got into bitcoin recently but I only used up a specific amount of funds that I wouldn't have a heart attack over lol. Not sure why this wasn't obvious to most people.

It's funny because when prices are skyrocketing and the bulls are out in full force, that's when they think they should be buying. But when the market has been in a stagnant state lately, they don't want to buy now.

Honestly what the banks are doing is God damn hypocritical and should be unlawful. They seem to have no problem with people going to a casino and maxing out their credit cards. But oh God forbid someone makes a crypto related transaction.
