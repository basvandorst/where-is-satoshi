Lots of people are waiting for that so they can buy, though.  Then the price will go back up, at least to a point.
What would you do if tomorrow, BTC was $5k each because a bunch of people sold?  I'd buy 20 of em

It's intrinsic value isn't 0- btc is still used to convert USD into other coins, which have low transaction fees or other real-use cases.

Explain Elon Musk then.  Elon is worth $20 billion.  He had enough money 20 years ago to never work a day in his life again.  
You can only take risks like Elon when there are no consequences for failure.  No matter how badly he screws up, he will never struggle to pay rent.  And so, he's free to try to build spaceships and shit.

We will eventually reach the point where the only people employed full time are a small set of specialized laborers.  You can't have an economy that runs on art.  
UBI would increase the trend towards entrepreneurship and gigs.  No more working some shit 9-5 earning $10/hr to move up the ladder.

More like when they pass off fentanyl analogs as heroin.  The majority of overdoses are due to users not knowing exactly what it is they are using, and therefore not knowing exactly what dosage to use. 
Opiates wouldn't be that bad if they were legal and administered under medical supervision, like they are doing now in France and Denmark.  For the present, the darknet is safer than buying from a street dealer.

That's a gambler's mentality.
Better to assume your investment is gone, as if you never had it in the first place.  Then, you can make decisions based on what you have now, and how much you are willing to lose.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value.  Everything that is valuable is so because others believe it to be.  Even human life would not be valuable if we did not agree that it is.

Supporting drug dealers is a plus for me.
Drug laws are bullshit, and without drug dealers we would be stuck with them.  Are you OK with the government being able to tell you what to do with your body?
Plus, what happens when your doctor prescribes you medicine, but it costs 10 times what it should at the local pharmacy?  If it's cheaper overseas, you can get it at a fair price on the darknet.  They are doing us a great service.


Meh.  Society is why we have religion, soul-crushing desk jobs and institutionalized inequality.  I'm not a fan.

Just like dollars
$1 is worth 9000 satoshis now, but just two weeks ago it was worth 15,000.  It could go back up again- who knows.  
The very existence of an easily accessible volatile asset like Bitcoin means that everything else is just as risky to hold because of opportunity cost.  If bitcoin goes up, you just lost every dollar you didn't gain by not buying bitcoin.  
Besides, bitcoin is more stable than ever.  In the early days it could swing ~500% a month while today it's more like 10-50%.  If it were to reach $500K or so it would have a similar market cap and stability as gold.

Yes, they are extremely important features.  Maybe you don't do drugs, but what if birth control, abortion, or your prescription medication were outlawed where you live?  
Or if not outlawed, some medications are unreasonably expensive through pharmacies.  For example, I had a prescription for Modafinil when I did shift work... but that stuff's like $30/dose in the US.  Outside the US it's $1-3 a dose though.  Sometimes this gap is far more extreme.

This is the goal, it is not?  Maximize the profit/work ratio.  That's why mankind invented technology.  One glorious day, when robots replace workers, we will all be capitalists, making our livings by simply by choosing where to best allocate our resources, without having to actually do anything.
Crypto is good because it automates lots of stuff usually handled by banks and lawyers, and has the potential to eliminate those jobs.  And it makes it easier to buy drugs and ignore laws.
