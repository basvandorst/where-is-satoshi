Are there any forms of advertisement for bitcoin? Probably not official, but like posters on walls...?
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:56:21
Are there still people reluctant to use BTC? If so why?

for a block to be valid (accepted by everyone, including the folks who dont update the software) it needs to have only 1 coinbase transaction, with a deterministic amount based on the block height. you cant have more coins being included in a valid block... you need to hard fork the chain

haha shoot ! back and excited !!
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:57:46
so exited !!
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:01:20
how?! changing consensus rules like coin supply does require a hard fork

Great read indeed !!
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:49:47
Thanks! That'd be awesome indeed, but I am sure some will, now it's our job to spread it!
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:26:22
Haha nice dude ! what’s your research about?! I agree and it feels great to be a part of it !
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:33:33
nice ! feel free to share it with me in pm if I can help in any way, would love to just give you some feedback ;)

Down the rabbit hole !!

What I want to spread is the knowledge, I'm not and will never tell anyone to buy or sell, your money your move. And your wrong I have taught IRL and explain to a lot of people what bitcoin and the blockchain is, some of my close friends went in  and there are not angry at all because I always told them, the price can go anywhere in the short run. I do believe than in the long run it will go up, but that's my view. I do think everyone should know what it is, even if a lot of people do not need to know, it's pretty damn interesting.
Apparently, this does not apply to you because for some reasons you are able to know where the price will go in the short run, so congrats, you are soon going to be a billionaire !! If you do not have a lot of money to invest in, you should consider selling advice to the big funds out there that are already in this market, I'm sure they will pay a lot to spot the changes between a bear and a bull market.
More seriously, I have been studying markets in general for about 10Y, what I can tell you is that bitcoin is a very small market with a lot of inside information, already included in the price, that makes it very very difficult to profit from it in the short run. But if do, congrats, I prefer to hodl on. I actually do not think I will need to sell my bitcoin for fiat in the future, I believe that at some point, 2Y, 5Y, or 10Y from now, I'll be able to buy real estate and stuff with my btc. But that's my opinion.
About the spreading, once again I was talking about the knowledge, not trying to make everyone buying bitcoin if they don't want to. I wouldn't buy anything now if I don't understand exactly what it is.

thanks !
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:32:02
thanks man ! yes everyone should do that, we just need to spread the word to initiate people and guide them through the right information
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:24:23
Yes always but don’t regret man, it’s not about the price, it’s all about the tech! Of course it’s always nice to make some money :) but it does come with a great risk !
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:25:29
we should start a community ;)
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:09:13
The price will go up as a consequence of more people coming into the space, and it is therefore a measure of global sentiment toward bitcoin, which is fine.
What I meant was, you should not focus on the price because it does not matter from the individual perspective ! You should not regret buying too little at some price, we are still very early stage, and you’ll still get some return in the end! Otherwise stated : making money should not be the main motivation behind buying bitcoin, it should be a consequence of you faith in the tech ;)
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:06:59
so true !! I made my choice : never regret, learn, and buy !

Day trading and speculation is the hardest way of playing that game. If you’re confident and can afford some short term losses, you should own some. If you dont, now may not be the best moment to enter, I agree, but once you get in just Hodl on! Spoting the start and the endof a bear market is just too hard!
Regarding speculators, right people are still hoping to make some money, and they probably will... but at some point people need to stop hoping for the kind of return we’ve seen in the past. And later on, people will buy bitcoin not making any money but just because it is useful (when it will be useful I mean).
We have a wave of speculators right now coming in the space, since a couple of years, but then it will be a wave a people just wanting to own sope bitcoin, even if they know they wont get enormous return!
