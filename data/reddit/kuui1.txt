I only care because it's a powerful tactic on the left to call crap racist. As soon as something is labeled as such they no longer feel they need actual arguments to defend their claims. 
This professor is claiming that "far-right" politics (which to the left means fascist/white supremacist) is coded directly into bitcoin. A far out claim that he never actually supports, but that didn't stop a university press from releasing the book.

I think some alt projects are really interesting, including ETH... But as I mentioned I think valuable innovations will eventually be stacked on top of bitcoin. Ethereum's Virtual Machine is a perfect example. It's a novel idea that could prove very useful, and now bitcoin has that functionality byway of a sidechain named Rootsock. 
I think there are a lot of scams out there, especially be wary of anything with a pre-mine the founders are sitting on... but I don't think they're all jokes. I think the irrational hype-driven markets, however, are a joke. I try to ignore them most of the time as I believe it's just noise in the long run, and I'm not here to get rich quick so I don't care about pump 'n dumps. 
I think bitcoin will be extremely valuable in the future. I don't have a particular price in mind, but I believe it will be so high it would be hard for us to wrap our brains around right now. Even if you were to mention this time a year ago that bitcoin would be worth what it is today, it'd have been hard for me to wrap my brain around. But now that we're here it makes sense if you [look at as adoption via Metcalfe's Law.](

Because with replace by fee you can chose a really low fee and see if it goes through. If it doesn't get in a block in your preferred time frame you can replace the fee with the market rate. You can still use the network with lower fees you just have to plan ahead and use these features.

It's quite telling that you buy into that false narrative like the one you're pedaling while ignoring real facts that can be proven about actual conspiracies. 
You know, for example, Bitmain blocking Segwit because it would prevent their patented ASICBoost from being used covertly giving what is basically already a monopoly further competitive advantages over their competition. 
Hmmm... I wonder why bcash doesn't have Segwit.
Or do you remember that time that the only current manufacturer of SHA256d miners (again in case you weren't paying attention we're talking about Bitmain) had to provide a firmware update for their miners that had a secret remote kill switch installed?

Devs are important. Keep in mind most the code in BCH was copied from core. One of the few alterations made, Emergency Difficulty Adjustment, was extremely buggy out of the gate. Which shows they're willing to use code that isn't production ready.

Bitcoin has high fees because so many people are using it. Most competing alts main selling point is that they're cheaper and faster to transact with. So their supporters often push a narrative that bitcoin is old tech that's broken, switch to ours that's technically superior. 
The reality is those coins are fast and cheap to use because they're barely being used, especially when compared to bitcoin. If they had anything near the user base of bitcoin they'd all have their own scaling issues as well. 
Now here's the kicker, scaling solutions for bitcoin have been in the works for a while now and some are coming online (e.g. Lightening Network). Bitcoin needs to scale exponentially, which is complicated by the fact that blockchains are horrible at scaling while maintaining their distributed nature. 
I suspect once Lightening Network matures and bitcoin has instant, cheap transactions, and micro-transactions are finally a reality, the selling points for most alts will disappear and their speculative value will plummet. 
Check out the LN project when you have time. It's an amazing concept with far-reaching implications for bitcoin's use cases.

That's exactly the kind of false narrative I'm talking about. Nobody blocked a block size increase. The block size increase proposals never had enough consensus to do it. Core isn't going to implement a change without 95% consensus. Which is a good thing. The fact that it's so hard to change bitcoin on the protocol level is why I value it personally.
I'm pro core and I also believe we will eventually have an increase, but it'll happen at a time when other upgrades are ready and when the hard fork is not contentious--meaning it has consensus. 
The people I know who were against the most recent proposal Segwit2x was because it was a back room deal between corporate entities and a mining cartel. That's not how bitcoin's consensus works. They don't have authority over the users.  
I only bring up bcash because this is their narrative they're always pedaling. It's not actually what's happened. Yes, many on this side don't think we should scale linearly. That includes myself. 
That doesn't mean we won't need to increase the size for other reasons in the future. Increasing the size, however, or allowing unlimited block sizes determined by miners, is a slippery slope to having transactions censored byway of raising the barrier of entry for node operators.

I plan on using some of my BTC myself to open payment channels once the network is mature. I think it provides a great opportunity to earn income from one's BTC holdings. I believe it will also further limit the supply available on markets as some people will prefer to hold theirs in a payment channel and earn income from their BTC--it will incentivize holding in a way similar to PoS coins I suspect. 
It's the revolution of money because it allows for new use cases that are presently not served. For example, microtransactions which is far reaching when talking about internet. A blogger or a newspaper, for example, will be able to sell individual articles at10 cents a piece. 
I do believe it will gain traction. LN will be in the background of wallet apps, even ones like Coinbase's. It won't be anymore difficult to transact with a lightening-enabled wallet than any other smartphone wallet app, etc. 


I really recommend doing some research on how much bitcoin's source code has evolved over the years. There are hundreds of contributors and it has been vastly improved upon in many different areas.

You're clueless. Anyone is free to use segwit or impliment it into their platform. The couple times I've moved coins from old wallets recently was so I could dump Bcash. I moved my BTC to a segwit address and paid about 85% less in fees and it was included in one of the two next blocks.

Smart money cares about things like decentralization and a development team with a proven track record. BCH just copied core's code. One of the few actual changes they made to the code, the emergency difficulty adjustment, right out of the gates was buggy as hell.

So tell me again how it is a "far" better investment? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:44:05
You subtract the 8k from the price you bought at to determine gains or losses. So in your example, let's assume you bought your BTC at $4k which means you'd have a 100% profit at $8k. 
This means that $10 was your original cost basis of that purchase and your profit was $10 which is what you'd owe taxes on.

I base my personal investment strategy on the history of internet protocol development and open source development like Linux, not irrational hype driven markets. So long term I can only recommend bitcoin, because I feel any innovation that is actually found to be worthwhile from alts will eventually just be stacked atop of bitcoin. 
Now if you wanna play the alt markets to earn more BTC, I support you but I don't have any advice as I was burned years ago on alts and have already learned my lesson. 
A lot of folks repeat that old adage "buy low, sell high," but I doubt they realize how low is low with alts. 
Litecoin, for example, hit an all-time high in 2014 around $60, within a year it went under a dollar. Now if you held through that you'd be in the green, but your returns would be far less than if you had just held bitcoin.

Personally if I were in this situation I'd likely keep a good portion in BTC. The rest I would use a service like vaultoro.com and use it as a gold bank; when I needed to withdraw to buy something etc, I'd sell gold for BTC then to fiat but only when needed.

Gold/silver are in similar bear markets as bitcoin. I think as long as people trust central banking assets with properties of sound money will continue to be undervalued. When confidence in fiat finally wanes to a certain point I think we'll see BTC, gold, etc return closer to their actual value.

On the flip side, it always amazes me how statist care very little that the state has be co-opted by big banks and know very little about the money they use nor how central banks world wide are running the biggest ponzi scheme in the history of man right under their noses while they are cheered on.

I think adoption could happen all of a sudden now that there's more infrastructure for Wall Street in place. The last BTCbubble there were only a handful of exchanges. So obviously a lot has changed -- from there being tickers on New York Stock Exchange/Bloomberg terminals to regulated BTC investment vehicles.
If we see a correction in the US stock market we might see investors exit into Bitcoin since the available cash in those markets are extremely limited. 
BTC is essentially digital cash, so it's possible it will be perceived as such and become a safe haven asset for Wall  Street. 
Stock markets are a lot more fragile than most of their participants think, especially when you consider a lot of those folks unknowingly own the same assets that others own -- then consider the fact that actually physical USDs in cash form or coinage is less than 1% of the entire money supply -- you have the ingredients to make enough rocket full for a trip to the moon.

With Myriadcoin a single block requires only one of the PoW algorithms to be solved. Each of the 5 algos has a chance to find the next block and the reward for each algorithms is 20% of the total supply. So asics mining the sha are only competing against other asics for 20% of the coins while a gpu miner on qubit is competing against other miners on qubit for the 20% allotted to that algo. 
This means in order to commit a double-spend attack an entity would need to gain more than 80% of the hashing power acrossed the majority of algorithms.
If an algorithm became too centralized it could be swapped out with a new algo in an effort to thwart centralization trends

I agree with the overlying sentiment of the OP but one should diversify. There are other "assets" with the properties of sound money as well, such as physical gold and silver. 
Also, when they're more ways to invest in businesses in a decentralized manner, such as Overstocks new venture, I'd consider investing in tech companies building atop of blockchain tech. 
Personally, I would avoid any "investments" that are part of the legacy financial system. I find it extremely hard to trust any type of paper asset at this point of the game. It all appears too artificially inflated for my tastes.

Are you familiar with what happened in Cyprus that caused the first bitcoin bubble? If or when fiats like the Euro collapse the last place you want to store your money is a bank. 
The best part about bitcoin is that you can be your own bank and you have to trust no one.

It won't end up as centralized by its design. The best working model presently of multi-PoW is Myriadcoin which uses 5 algorithms. So by using 5 instead of one it would require a great deal more than 51% of the networks hashrate to perform a double-spend attack. So by its nature it can never become as centralized as a single PoW algorithm
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:30:26
You would need multiple pools in theory but that's why it's nearly impossible or at least 5x more difficult to perform than on bitcoin. You're framing this argument as if the mining of the different algos are static in nature when in fact it's the opposite. Myriad even has software that changes to the most profitable algorithm so it's always in a state of flux. But even if GHash attempted what youre suggesting Myriad can swap out algorithms with new ones to ensure decentralization. 
Decentralization is the entire point. This 51% issue is the result of a decentralized network becoming too centralized 
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:35:11
Interesting thought here. I personally don't think PoS is secure but using a 6th algorithm that wasn't PoW as a sort of checkpoint is interesting to think about. Perhaps some other kind of Proof, maybe one that hasn't even been thought of yet.

A fake economy. 
The real problems will begin when other countries move away from using the dollar as their reserve currency. We're already seeing this start, some call it de-dollarization. A lot of people don't realize that a large portion of dollars in circulation are held offshore for trading things like oil. If other countries start dumping their dollar holdings for some other vehicle of trade we could see hype-inflation.

Suggest mining on a much smaller scale as a hobby if he can't shake the idea of plugging in a machine that will make coins. Bitmain has great Th/s to $ ratios and they're not doing that presale scam crap. It's really hard to actually come out ahead buying ASICs compared to just outright buying coins.

Depends. PoW is antiquated but multi PoW increases and ensures decentralization. There's no reason to limit the securing of a blockchain to a single hashing algorithm when you can run multiple algorithms concurrently on a single blockchain. 
Edit. there's a working model of this in the Altcoin space called Myriadcoin. It uses 5 algorithms at the same time to secure its blockchain. Sha and scrypt asics can mine along side gpus and cpus on a level playing field while increasing decentralization.

Alt coin developers, many of whom I warned directly, such as Vericoin who run centralized services on their network have plenty to be worried about.
Centralized services have a central point of failure and in these cases it's often going to be the Devs themselves whom are running these services without any considerations in regards to compliance. They're running their coins like a business (eg PayPal) but thought they're immune because their project was supposedly a cryptocurrency.

I moved one btc to silver before the SR auction panic more than a month ago and they've mostly been locked within a few dollars of each other, going up and down together. 
It'll be interesting to see how long this trend continues. I don't follow gold prices but I silver usually moves with gold so btc might be somewhat coupled with gold recently.

Technically it's not impossible but it's exponentially more difficult than a 51% attack on bitcoin. CEX.io would have to gain more than 80% of the network including at least 3 of the 5 algorithms which isn't easy as only 2 of the algorithms are asic minable. So they'd likely need 2 different kinds of asics along with other hardware which is entirely different than the situation now with bitcoin in which they only require on type of asic

One possible solution is switching to multi PoW. Forcing decentralization by allowing more people to participate in the network would be good for every one. 
There's a working model now in the Altcoin space called Myriadcoin. It uses 5 algorithms running concurrently to secure a single blockchain. Each algorithm has the same chance of finding the next block reward and gpus, cpus can mine along w/ sha and scrypt asics. Using a 5 seperate algorithm in this manner means an entity would have to gain the majority of hashing power of the majority of algorithms to achieve a double spend attack which means they'd need far greater than 51%

Well, yes and no. Some are speculating that if the prices goes down further or remains at these levels for too long we will see Bitcoin's difficulty drop. This hasn't been the case yet, in fact it's still rising, but if that became a trend it could affect Bitcoin's security.

I agree, which is one of the reasons I'm so fond of Bitcoin. But if they felt it was threat they could keep the price down as long as they wanted and thus affect market perception. Like I mentioned, they're already doing this with foreign currencies, so it doesn't feel that far-fetched to me.
I personally feel that Bitcoin's biggest flaw at this stage is it's mostly only traded against fiat.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:01:04
It's not looking that way to me. I have 2 friend in particular who had listen to me talk about why Bitcoin is so great for almost 3 years, and now that the price has come back near pre-bubble levels they're buying. One has bought 4 in the past couple days the other just bought 2 today. 
The price drop is good in terms of fair distribution and for those who felt left behind during the inflated-bubble prices.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:50:34

They wouldn't have to necessarily pump the price to accumulate. They can sit tight on buy orders and over time allow people to sell into them. Or buy over-the-counter. 
I almost never actually buy someone else's order. I wait for someone to sell into my order.
Well so far Bitcoin's network has been really impressive against attacks. I'm not sure technically how it would hold up on an attack like youre suggesting but I'd bet its distributed nature might make denial-of-service attacks less effective than attack a regular server.

Let me see, it takes how long to do an international money xfer? While using a distributed public ledger that is secured by mathematics can do it in seconds without worrying about loss, etc. And that is just one application. Obviously one of the most ideal functions of having a distributed public ledger is that one knows without a doubt who owns what, which is not the case w/ the legacy financial system.

So currently registered NY residents need to withdraw and close their accounts?
If so, is there a time window that this needs to be done by like other exchanges have done?
Will Vaultoro eventually block NY ip adresses?

I assume you wrote [this]( I notice the claim that tonal Bitcoin is the first "altcoin."
 I disagree because I define altcoin differently, as do others. IMO a distinguishing aspect of an altcoin compared to other coins is that it has its own blockchain along with genesis block. 
Time will sort out the semantics, but until then you should know there's no full agreement on Bitcoin jargon and not everyone accepts the way you choose to use certain words.

Coinbase.com is likely the easiest and won't have the premium sellers usually add on top. Circle.com also still services NY as far as I know. Both services work like paypal linking to your bank account.

The thing about Backpages is that's where almost all ads are posted for Escorts/Backrubs, etc. So for everyone to magically switch to the same new classified ad platform would be tricky at best.

If that's actually the case then why haven't they been charged with a crime? 
Instead the DOJ circumvented due process by cutting off their access to certain payment options, which sounds pretty shady and is not much different than [this](

A friend of mine uses BTC to post there because Chase kept blocking the charges via her visa check card.

There are no buyers and sellers other than Backpage selling ad space. They're not an intermediary betwenn transactions.
Although your advice does matter to those posting ads who don't want their identity compromised. It seems however that most their posters we're willing to use regular debit/credit cards so that's not much of a concern for them since bitcoin was already an available payment option.

She learned how out of necessity because her bank was blocking her from purchasing ads and backpages is where all the web traffic for these sorts of thing happen to be. 
So if Backpages still remains the place where customers looking for such services go, I'd not be surprised to see most of their users to start using bitcoin. 
Setting up a Coinbase or circle account is no more difficult than setting up a paypal account.

That's known as harm reduction and makes perfect sense which is why it has gained almost no traction in the USSA. It seems the majority here prefer the backward ways of criminalizing behavior they deem to be immoral.
It's the same thing with the war on drugs. Harm reduction would benefit most everybody yet they still rather throw people in cages without thinking critically about how it causes more harm to society than good.

What you see as people trying to pump the price, I see as people being enthusiastic about disruptive technology that has tons of potential. 
Perhaps I see it that way because I don't care too much what the price is and yet I enjoy reading other's enthusiasm as they highlight some of the more obvious use cases (e.g. avoiding capital controls or paying for an online sex-worker ad).

I didn't when my original stack of an average cost of $450 lost 50% of its value.

There are plenty of honest independent working girls who use Backpage, too! So what're we supposed to limit their right to free speech for an issue that's being exaggerated/politicized?
I'm not saying that trafficking isn't taking place but Backpage is not the root of the problem, and only focusing on them infringes on others' rights to use such a platform.

Credit cards were used to pay for ads that were placed or to raise the visibility of an ad placed, not to pay for services rendered by those placing ads. They normally take only cash but now that they need Bitcoin to place ads they may be more willing to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:58:38
My friend has been using coinbase to purchase her ads without issue. But youre correct that that doesn't mean they won't face the same pressures as Visa/Mastercard in the future. As of right now, however, it works fine. 
As for how they get paid for their services, it usually tends to be cash only, but now that they'll need BTC to pay for their ads more of them may be willing to accept it as payment to use later for their adverts. 
Edit: you're right about this being a huge opportunity to educate their industry. Perhaps we should put some ads on Backpages.com telling them to come the Bitcoin subreddit if they have any questions or need help getting started w/ wallets etc.
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:21:54
Well Visa and American Express did the same thing and cut backpages.com off so I fail to see your point. They all suck. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:14:01
Backpage averages 9 million USD a month in ad revenue. Prior to Amex, Mastercard and Visa discontinuing services , Bitcoin was a very small portion of that monthly revenue. 
After these credit cards canceled their services the Backpage users did not move to a new platform, knowing well enough that the customers they seek are using Backpage. So Instead these users have been learning how to use Bitcoin despite that type of tech being outside their normal comfort zone.

I'm pretty sure your average hooker can use circle or coinbase. It's as easy to use as facebook or paypal. And it's all that's needed to place an ad on backpage.

It's been rather steady for most of this year and if you've been accumulating from say 200 to 240 the current price doesn't feel too bad.
As with almost anything that goes up parabolically, as Bitcoin did going from $120 to 1200 in a matter of weeks, it's going to retract heavily. This latest rise has been happening steadily so there's a good chance it won't retract to the low 200 range. 
Anything can happen but it doesn't seem like a bad bet when it comes to investing. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:43:12
I've been thinking about this since the story broke. Backpages is well established for this niche, so if their users actually stay and not leave for another classified platform, this could easily be the most volume transactions business-wise for Bitcoin. This might be huge!

Something insane unfortunately, unless you wanna end up like Charlie Sherm.

The easiest way I've found to get BTC without a mark up is connecting a bank account to Cirlce.com or Coinbase.com

That's funny logic you're using there. The way in which central banks operate is the definition of central planning. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:52:18


@_date: 2015-04-03 01:16:05
check points = centralization, which means there's a central point of failure. Moreover, you must "trust" the operator of those checkpoints to not be colluding. The fact that that remains a plausible variable means it is not superior in terms of security/decentralization.
Although it can be said it is superior in terms of energy efficiency; I don't think most are willing to make that sort of trade off for that.

Are you going to pay his exit fee? It's not like you're free to just move to another country and not pay taxes. In fact, the US is the only developed economy that requires its citizens to pay income taxes even if that income was made in another country.

Sure but what happens when everyone notices these banks are all insolvent and they're forced to do things such as bail-ins?
It's pretty basic in my opinion. Bitcoin allows you to hold them yourself by keeping your private keys secret. According to the blockchain if you let someone else hold your private keys like an exchange you're no longer the owner of the bitcoin associated with those keys. 
Multi-sig allows you to hold your keys still while being able to have your bitcoin on an exchange which in this instance would have thwarted the hackers . 
I agree that the average user doesn't want to deal with learning how to take these steps, but the evolution of the tech will make this all seamless eventually and the front user won't need to know what multi-sig is etc.
