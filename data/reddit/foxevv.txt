There's this lady, they call her "The Yellen".
Anyway, long story short, she has the most powerful UScoin ASIC every created.  She 51%'s it every day for breakfast lunch and dinner.
And then gives UScoin away for free to places like Israel.
China holds a *massive* amount of UScoin, so every day this printing goes on their holdings get less valuable.
They've even expressed their displeasure with this process yet The Yellen does it anyway!
Funny part is China is the biggest ManBearWhale in the world!  You wouldn't want to piss off the biggest ManBearWhale in the world right?  Yet they do it anyway! LOL.  Once the Chinese decide to dump UScoin interest rates on UScoin will go through the roof spiking velocity of money resulting in massive inflation in UScoin!
Since everyone was forced to buy into the UScoin scheme long ago due to threat of military assault if they didn't, everyone will be affected by the China ManBearWhale.
And they don't even see it coming!  Quite hilarious really.
Thankfully I found this other currency a few years ago that The Yellen can't manipulate.  We usually call them "bits" for short.

Bitcoin uses a layering of encryption algorithms.  Just because one is broken doesn't mean the whole thing falls apart.
SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, and secp256k1(ECDSA) are a few that come to mind used in Bitcoin.
If SHA-256 is broken, RIPEMD-160 isn't necessarily, so addresses aren't automatically hacked.
Block creation would be pretty jacked up in this scenario though.  But old coins would be fine.

The point is if the transactions were not initiated by the buyers, but instead the sellers, they are called sells.  Your point is simply "there is an order book".  Yes, there is all the way to $0.01.  Driving the order book down to $0.01 would create a lot of volume, but it would not be to the north, just as the recent selling has been negative.

Because it would be rendered useless.  One could transfer Bitcoin to the ring-signature side-chain, mix them around, and import them back into the main chain.  Completely untraceable.  The great thing about alt-coins is, for instance, the ring-signature technology has already been written and is understood.  Sadly the people holding those coins will lose whatever value they thought they held.

Improved payer privacy, e.g. the ring signature scheme used by Monero, can reduce the
systemic risk of the transactions of particular parties being censored, protecting the fungibility
of the cryptocurrency. Improvements to this have been suggested by Maxwell and Poelstra
400 [MP14, Poe14b] and Back[Bac13a], which would allow for even greater privacy. Today,
ring signatures can be used with Monero coins, but not bitcoins; sidechains would avoid this
