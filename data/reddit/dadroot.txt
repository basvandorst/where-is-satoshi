Sell now to avert more losses, the main reason that made people buy bitcoin was the promisse of huge gains in a short time, that rise ended last year, so now, what you're likely to see, is a stead decline in prices as more and more people realize that they are not going to make a fortune.

Hi, I'm from China, the government is currently orchestrating a big selloff with all bitcoin exchanges in the country, that's the reason for today's fall. You guys should understand why a decentralized anonymous independent alternative currency is so dangerous to  communist unelected government
