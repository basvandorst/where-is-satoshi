I'm already reaping the benefit of the litecoin halving. Up a ton.

I'll roll the dice and short Bitcoin 20x on OKCoin futures.

If you need to buy to short then yes. If you are buying to hold then no.

The price stayed $300-$400 for 3 months then fell at the end of last year.  
Now the price has been $200-$300 for a little over 3 months. With the lower price I'm guessing more people will buy here. But what will we run out of first. People buying above $200 or people selling above $200. Only time will tell.

Wow, I rarely do that. I even reread that comment and didn't catch it.

Bitcoin halving so there won't be much mining and dumping and perhaps the miners would be more inclined to hold but then would dump at higher price.

The fund holds 130,000 BTC. But current holders must sell them to those wanting to buy after the current holders have held on for them for 1 year. They may not even want to sell them. The hope is this fund in the end has to buy more BTC which sends the price up as they buy on the exchanges.

China more specifically OKCoin can only hold this up for so long. The reason they held it up was to take out as much money as they could. Now that people are quickly realizing the pumpers have left the building people are trying to slowly sell everything. Soon everyone will panic sell at once and a huge dump will occur.

The less ways bitcoin can be spent the better. Everyone just needs to hold. Hold so the bigger whales can sell more of their BTC and leave the small fish bagholding.

All these people selling on exchanges have to buy back in eventually. They just want to wait and buy back in when everyone else is for the instant gratification.

Enough for 36 people to put $1,000,000 in. How about these rich Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon people. Could find a couple hundred wanting to put a million in. Then go to China and other places to get more rich people.

Do you know how many people live in China...

500,000 is 0.0003% of the total population.
