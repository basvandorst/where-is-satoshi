Yeah, those are exactly my thoughts.
However, I don't think you can even attribute it to conspiracy theorists twisting everything into a conspiracy because you hardly ever see someone claim that gold is a conspiracy.
With all the fluctuations in Bitcoin recently, people don't understand that the major holders of gold (the banks and governments) can easily manipulate that market at will. Let's say a government sold all their gold to boost their fiat money... What happens to the price of gold, then?
Well, Cyprus is already talking about selling their gold to boost their economy. 
What happens when all the governments have left to do is sell it all to avoid an economic meltdown? Why, sell their gold of course... They don't really have enough Bitcoin. :D

Right. Try posting about it now. I got banned and the post was deleted. ;) 31 results over a 6 month period hardly makes sense compared to a 1.3 million daily visitor count, the supposed demographics of the site, and the rise in interest in Bitcoin by the general population.
It just really makes me wonder.

Thanks for giving the effort to help validate my points, it is greatly appreciated. :)
Isn't it sort of spooky that both the MSM and conspiracy sites are actively trying to stifle interest in Bitcoin? The implications of this seem staggering.

Thanks :)
Oh, and checkout this link for someone claiming the same thing happened to him: 
You can't really censor something completely (in this case Godlike Productions has 31 topics on Bitcoin over a 6-month period as  pointed out), or it becomes too obvious. You just have to keep the post count low enough so as to not attract too much attention to what you don't want people to see.

Why the downvotes? I'm just curious and genuinely interested in anything that might be wrong in the post, or why it doesn't sit well.
