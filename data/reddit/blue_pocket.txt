How many confirmation do you get?

I have the same problem. It's been 2 days. It's 7sat/byte. Do you reckon it will confirm? I'm still waiting on 1st confirmination

Less now

So is it safe to assume in my situation it will stay unconfirmed for 2 weeks then gets returned to sender?

Lies. Show proof. :)

It only allows 10sat+/byte. A company sent me at 7sat/byte.
What do I do?

Let's say you invested at 12k. Bitcoin drops to 10k. You want to cut your losses fast and sell. Bitcoin continue to drop to 8k. Then it shows it's climbing back up to 9k fast. What do you do?  
A) keep waiting and see if it's really stably going up
B) buy now since the tide has changed
If you chose option 1, it's possible that bitcoin has quickly reached 11k before you can access the situation. If you buy now, you would of been better off not selling in the first place.
If you chose second option, it may just be a temporary boost and once you buy , it continues to drop. Do you now sell again at a lost or hold?

The fee is dynamic, depending on how congested the network is. The miners who mined the block and put your transaction in the block gets rewarded the fee (think of it as verifying your transaction). They pick the ones who's offering the highest miner fee first. There is no company behind bitcoin.


The Bitcoin core devs/foundation, disagreeing devs fork (copy) bitcoin into say bitcoin cash.


Simple Google search should give you want your looking for specifically.
