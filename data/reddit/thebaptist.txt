So their goal is to make all fiat worth way less? How does that make any sense? So nobody on this planet can buy anything anymore. And all this happening within 3 years? Competely delusional. You're detached from reality. 
Do you have any idea how much nonsense you're typing?

He will contact you privately claiming you won. He will then send you a coinbase link where you can redeem your coins which is his phising link. Many people will fall for this as they have done in the past.

Not really. Most Bitcoiners don't actually spend their coins. There is no point in businesses accepting Bitcoin. They won't have customers. Like 1000's of companies before them they will remove the option after the trial period.

I cloned yer momma last night and took yer allowance for the next 2 months.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:47:54
I'll explain it for the 5th time.  
After a week he will contact you through pm (mass pm bot), send an awesome letter how you are the lucky winner. He then gives you a link explaining that for whatever reason you need to accept it through a coinbase coupon or something similar. 
Desperate bitcoiner is desperate and will login to his coinbase account through the hacker his phishing link. The hacker's bot will then instantly empty that account. 
And don't give me this "bitcoiners are tech savy" bs. As you can see 100's of people are extremely desperate and would sell their mother for a coin. The fact that they en masse posted their address also shows how extremely naive they are. 
They will blindly click anything if the guy tells them their 1000 coins are ready. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:36:51
Yes there is harm in this. You will find out in a week when tons of people got phished.

Of course it's fake! C'mon. How can anyone think this is real??? I just can not get over the fact that 100's of people here thought it was real and posted their address. Unbelievable. 
In case anyone wonders why so many bitcoiners get scammed, well, here is your answer. It takes absolutely no effort whatsoever to troll bitcoiners. Promise them money and they will believe everything you tell them. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:47:29

"Take The Power Back"
Bring that shit in! Uggh!
Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
Now check this out...uggh!
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and right
So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge
And bow down to their God
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam
Step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change
And to counteract
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back
The present curriculum
I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting
To hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causin' tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that is why
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back
Hey yo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it,
break it down
Awww shit!
And like this...uggh!
Come on, yeah! Bring it back the other way!
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it
Yet we hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Take it back y'all
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back y'all, come on!
Take it back y'all
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back y'all, come on!

You don't seriously think i'm gonna read that do you?
Whatever you typed i bet you simply could add a TL;DR extremely desperate. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:04:53
How do people like you not get scammed all day long?
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:38:58
Reddit software should auto-remove these stupid "this" posts. Complete waste of bandwidth. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 15:17:50
Nobody knows. But imo not much. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:24:50
Hilarious. People here are so full of shit. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:48:43

@_date: 2016-08-04 14:08:27
Because you look like a clown right now. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 20:04:43
What's the problem exactly?
Edit: i wish i could post here without someone hitting the downvote button all the time. Grow the hell up. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 11:21:53
Yet somehow people here still expect complete countries to move to Bitcoin. What reality do these people live in? Certainly not the same one as me. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:08:22
Should have
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:01:47
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:21:52
Stop giving that troll so much attention. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:34:33
Wtf? You asked for payment outside their network and then you get completely upset when they ban you? This has to be a joke. You can't be serious. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:48:15
Oh god, i can't believe i fell for it. You are one of those people i was talking about. Well done, you got me.

Sure. Sent
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:44:26
Because a common game here is to change things around when we talk about credit cards. Then it's suddenly about the seller's perspective and not the buyer. 
Credit cards payments take seconds. Period. But that's a fact some don't allow here so they start playing silly games like the person above.

God, this place is naive. Unbelievable.
This is such an old scam. After a week he will pm you and tell you you are the winner. Then he will tell you he will send it through a coinbase coupon or whatever and send you a phising link.
Downvoted by "i want to believe"
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:40:49
No answer because i answered it in 5 seperate posts already. Just one click on my username would've been enough as i explained 2 times. But i guess it's easier to just downvote me, right?
@_date: 2016-08-25 17:34:32
You are scammers. Your business exists because you allow scammers. You know that, i know that, everyone knows that. Stop pretending it's anything else. Fucking dumbass.

Can't wait to see how many will fall for this scam. People here never learn. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 00:01:00
There is no point in accepting Bitcoin for the next giant. But even if they do it will have the same effect as before with other big companies: nothing. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:05:03
TL;DR purse.io is a scammers haven. 
What the hell did you expect?
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:53:30
You have to be kinda mentally challenged if you still send Finex your money.

And that's why i never use my bitcoins for stuff like this. 
Edit: thanks for the downvote. I know right, what was i thinking posting an opinion on a forum. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:44:34
5%. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:11:26
My excuses. My point still stands but in this case not directed at you.

About 0.

When people here talk about mainstream adoption how exactly do they think this will happen with a payment system that might take a hour to go through?
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:47:40
It will simply the 200th thing that would take Bitcoin to the moon but didn't.

It's a scam, you tard. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:23:37
If you think someone random is gonna send 1000 free coins then you are extremely desperate and naive. You seem frustrated that this give away might be fake. Desperate even. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 17:37:27
Because many bitcoiners don't care about the fraud as long as they get big discounts. The libertarian way. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:21:46
Haha wth?
@_date: 2016-08-27 08:57:09
What are you saying? All Bitcoiners care about is just the price? They just want to get rich by holding bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:20:39


You're delusional. 
Probably Gox alone was close to that. Now add the shitloads of other exchanges that got hacked and other stuff and we're easily going towards 20% of all bitcoins. 
Don't bother to reply, i won't read your nonsense anymore. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:23:50
I could swear this was posted by that other nutter bitcoin_forever. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:05:56
Yeah because Bitcoin never drops 30% in a day. 
Such a safe haven. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:12:54
Check my previous post. This scam has already been done. It works. People fall for it. Stop being so naive. 
Who the hell downvotes an absolutely normal post like this? Why? Seriously, can one of you downvoters at least explain it?

Drugs. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 14:39:15
Why? Seriously, why?
I love Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin. But it just isn't a safe haven! It just is not. It's one of the most unsafe currencies to own! No sane person is gonna be like "well the dollar is doing bad, let's move to a currency that might drop 200 dollars when an exchange gets hacked". 
It just won't happen. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:17:53
Oh right. Well, what could possibly go wrong then if a real Bitcoin expert said so. 
Reminds me of all those experts claiming 10k+ in 2014, then in 2015 and then in 2016. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:50:08
Edit: clearly an old phishing scam that has been done before. It's absolutely insane to watch all these people fall for it. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 03:25:54
Do you think you're adding anything to the conversation with these type of posts?
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:01:07
Still waiting. Show me one post that shows that i hate bitcoin. 
Also give me some examples of how i am trolling.

@_date: 2016-09-17 16:16:12
Because they used the search. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:07:12
No idea. There is absolutely no reason for the average person to start using Bitcoin. I see no reason why it should go mainstream or why the bakery next door should start accepting it. 
Is there any sub out there where people downvote more than they do here? I highly doubt it. 
Why the hell do people go to public, open forums and then downvote everything they don't agree with? How absurd is that?
@_date: 2016-09-14 04:24:10
Why? Because i can't believe someone who wants to banks to a use a system that can handle 3 tps is serious?
Edit: why would anyone possibly downvote this? Jesus Christ, the people in this sub! Unbelievable!
@_date: 2016-09-13 22:53:39
You're completely delusional if you think banks can't and won't do instant transfers. And they understand Bitcoin enough to know that it's completely unusable for them. 
Yes, downvote those facts away. Like it never existed.

Do i jeed to explain it more?

"Hey guys, let's pretend that 3 tps is perfectly fine for all banks and downvote everyone who says something else!"
@_date: 2016-09-12 01:44:34
Discard the facts we don't like, right?
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:14:50

@_date: 2016-09-16 16:29:50
Right. Let's pretend that's not the general consensus here. 
Is there anything that doesn't get downvoted here?? What part of my comment is wrong or deserves to be downvoted in any way?
@_date: 2016-09-15 21:53:51
And in the next topic people are wondering why Bitcoin just won't go mainstream. 
What is there possibly to downvote? Can you people do anything else than downvoting shit all day long? Sometimes i wonder if people here log in just to downvote people and then log out again. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 01:17:34
No, you could not. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:52:46
These threads are pointless. You will either be ridiculed or called a troll and be told that everything is working just fine. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 08:17:53
I don't understand these kind of posts. 
What do you people expect exactly? That the price just goes up and up for no reason?
Also, why should the price go up? I thought it was all about the technology? Getting rid of the banks? Helping the poor? No?
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:20:05
You haven't told us how many of those cheap coins you bought! I'm so curious!
@_date: 2016-09-16 22:31:31
Well, you know, payment options that don't let you wait 40 mins. I'm sure you can think of a few. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 16:16:09
It isn't, obviously. 
Another idiotic thread voted to the top. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 11:04:11
So, like 99% of this sub?
@_date: 2016-09-11 21:30:55
It's not going higher step by step. It's actually down 50% of what it once was.
Edit: yeah, just downvote facts you don't like. Unbelievable.  
@_date: 2016-09-16 19:12:37
Checked again with todays vpn connection and this one works fine. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 22:18:53
How can people say this in one thread and in the next someone else is completely baffled that banks and whole countries haven't moved to bitcoin yet. 
How can the majority here simply ignore that it's completely unsuable for the masses?
@_date: 2016-09-15 23:35:04
These posts need to stop. 
A mod should add the word mining to the spam list. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 22:40:19
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 12:07:15
Nope, there is noooooooothing better or faster than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 22:33:11
Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 12:05:38
You heard him. None of those payment options work better or faster than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:13:39
Let me guess, we should also discard the 780 price 2 months ago. 
And any other price that shows us that bitcoin doesn't just go up and up. 
And of course when it's good for Bitcoin in a different discussion then we suddenly don't discard the 1200 mtgox price. "Bitcoin went up a miillllliion % since it was created!!!"
Yeah, i know how things work around here. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 22:33:03
I nowhere said it's trending down. I simply explained OP's comment is incorrect. But apparently that's now allowed if it isn't good for Bitcoin. 
Downvote away. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 12:07:20
10k in ~~2013~~ ~~2014~~ ~~2015~~ ~~2016~~ 2017! 2017 will be the year guyz! And if it's not then 2018!

Every time something goes wrong the answer is: you should've done x instead, you dumbass.

Hilarious title if you consider the amount of bitcoiners getting defrauded every single day.

You shouldn't use the default wallet, you silly!
Mainstream adoption any day now!

I just read that 600 = cheap coins. So you can buy safely now. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 11:44:31
Hold on. You're telling us that there is a 5 day hold on your account and in the same post you're wondering why your withdrawel doesn't go through. 
Stop trolling.

Just stop with these posts. Please. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 20:39:51
I don't. Because i know you didn't buy shit. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 12:27:21
The scam goes on and on. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:28:01
Or could it be that Bitcoin is completely useless to them at this point?
@_date: 2016-09-11 21:28:29
Or is it more likely something better will be created in the next 10 years? 
Peope using it now doesn't mean anything 10 years from now. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:13:37
Someone sold coins. You couldn't figure that out yourself?

@_date: 2016-09-12 11:36:04


Just like 99% of the people here. At least you admit it.
