I don't blame the creators as they just found a way to get BTC without buying them. I think people buy it expecting massive returns like BTC did in the past, buying 10 thousand shitcoins gives more hope than 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:46:53
No one said Bitcoins is the only problem. Discarding it because there is worse is why we got up to that point.
Everything counts.

I think it makes sense on a global scale, it means that if you want to trade something, you have to give something. 
You can't exploit people of other countries as easily as with inflationary, because what you give today have the same value tomorrow. I think it may means less trade, but probably more useful and fair

I couldn't open any account on a Japanese exchange. The procedures are just too complicated to verify (writing + pictures + physical verification with mail sent to your home). Something is wrong with the way I type the address it seems, never passed it.
Tried Liquid, Bitfinex, some with a kawai character I forgot the name.
Ended up buying a few from a person with bank wire (can be done at the ATM) - and saved my privacy I guess.
Used announcement website.

I'm not sure about the messages given here. 
First I seen it with no sound: I seen a message telling me that there is no market place to use bitcoins, I felt sad.
Then there is "one month free": is it a marketplace where I buy things and I have to pay every month on top of it ? Sorry but I won't click.
Hope this helps. Good initiative btw

Well your average Joe could consider Coinbase as a bank as it issue a visa card, I'm sure their card will be compatible to spend Bitcoin in the future. I don't see any difference with an online bank for him

Idk but some companies spend much more than 40€ on acquisition, this fact alone don't shock me so much.
Banks in my country give 100€ for a new account/referral with free credit card etc.
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:09:21
Let me guess you never been poor right ? I gone from wealthy in France to immigrant in another country starting from scratch with a low pay.
I previously saved up to 70% of my income because I don't like to spend and I am very careful, and my pay was comfortable.
Now that my pay is back to lower, guess what ? I finish the month with 0 because I just have to eat and pay the rent. How do I get out from this ? I have to work everyday more than 10h and hope the company will succeed and raise me, to get a tiny portion of what the boss will have. Until then I'm still poor, and I don't see how someone that don't want to lose his health at work can do to get away from this situation. It's like everything is made to suck all your pennies away from you. 
So I don't like what you said. And I feel shame I felt the same way before actually seeing how it's like by myself.

I suggest you make legal procedure against them as they stole your coins. They will provide the information they have to the police, it makes sense that they can't give it to you.
It's sad that it happened but if you are clean make legal action against them.

Which OS you used ?
What was your own personal encryption method ? There is good chances that self made encryption is way more weak than using a open source software like veracrypt.
And it looks like you make the same mistake again by storing it the same way, so you didn't learn anything. 
So I also vote for the BS option.

You can trade BTC for BCH and BCH for BTC so when BTC for USD raise, BCH follows.
If 1 BTC is 0.1 BCH and 1 BTC raise vs USD, BCH raise too.
Other than that relationship is that BCH is a fork of BTC by people pushing for a larger block size to allow cheaper transaction, but I think the motive was more likely to fork their BTC and have the same amount of BCH to sell it afterwards, but that's just my opinion

Yes ! But for the masses it may be needed a little bit more, they won't care if someone win 100 BTC imo. Soon

In fact they did get the money, the bank was not secured at the agency level and some random people managed to pass basic security. After filing a complaint at the police the bank took over and refunded her.
It just means if the data leaks from the exchange DB, some malicious people can get pretty creative with what they can do with the info. That's personally the reason I don't like this KYC, I don't trust the security of the exchanges and partners for the data storage
BTW it was one of the main banks in France

Not necessarily. It may be poorly coded and store the encryption key in RAM or on the disk. I would even suggest OP to not turn off the computer and make a memory dump if he didn't restart the computer since then. Backup everything including RAM and then only turn off the computer. And never connect it to internet again until the problem is solved or you give up

The thing is I don't give a shit about how much Bitcoin is worth, for me 1 BTC is 1 BTC and that's all. I exchanged some bitcoins for euro because I was thinking it was worth the amount requested. I don't even look at the exchange rate because I consider I got enough BTC to use it 
You talk about gambling and stuff but all your post talk about is fiat money, if you care about fiat why you exchanged it for BTC in the first place ?

You can secure your wallet online encrypted and manage your backups.
And if the online service gets hacked you just make a new wallet and transfer funds.
Coinbase will get hacked. They are a major target and it will happen someday. If they can't recover from the hack I won't be surprised if you lose everything.

Linux + Veracrypt + Double encryption with hidden volumes and fake wallet in each layer of volume with small amount, so it is also resilient to extortion - I think this would be best.
If someone see you having a branded hardware wallet (easily recognizable) - I think it could be very dangerous for your security (until Bitcoin is used by everyone).  
Actually I won't suggest Android wallet. With all the versions of Android and knowing Google and all the friends I won't be surprised if there is a keylogger built-in.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:14:03
I'm curious and never tried this, can you access the private key with a hardware wallet ?
  \- If no, how do you backup it (because I guess someday it will break) ?
  \- If yes, what is the point of the hardware wallet compared to an encrypted disk storage ?
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:25:14
Except the Google phones, all flavors of Android as OS-modified to add spyware/adware.
Few years ago, all apps could access very detailed infos about user actions (with a meteo app I could sniff all calls received/emitted and the phone numbers of every users) - because of shitty permission system. I won't be surprised if that is the case on some Android phones.
