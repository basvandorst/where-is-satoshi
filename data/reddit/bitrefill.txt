The 2% discount for Lightning applies site-wide, it does make a difference because many of our products are sold at face value or with varying markups. We do not apply a fixed exchange rate premium, please see our response to the op for more insight.
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:51:37
We get asked this question regularly, but people misunderstand how we work. The exchange rate is mostly irrelevant. When you see premium pricing on a gift card, it is because our cost to acquire the card is close to or above its face value and we add a markup %. 
We do our best to keep voucher prices as close to face value as possible, but many suppliers simply don't offer discounts or %s that allow us to stay at face value. The range you will see is roughly 0%-10% above face value of the card, and it varies by card. If you see a 10% premium, it is because it costs us greater than face value to provide the card at all. 
Our margins are modest.  
We would love to keep everything at face value, there is no scam or underhanded aspect here. We mark up our products to earn money, simple as that. As we grow, we are able to negotiate better pricing from our suppliers, but it is a long-term process. There is a lot going on behind the scenes to make our catalog possible and to provide so many cards from so many businesses for so many countries.   
What we learned is our customers would rather pay a premium than not have the product available at all, so we list new products no matter the cost, then work to improve costs over time.
Additionally, this year we will introduce some loyalty/reward/referral programs to help offset these things for customers that rely on us and stick with us over time.
Make no mistake, our mission is to help people live on crypto and to advance the inevitability of a Bitcoin circular economy, but we do need to have real revenue to continue to make that possible.
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:12:48
You are applying the term "vaporware" incorrectly. Thousands of people utilize us to enable living on crypto in ways they could not otherwise. A better explanation is here: [
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:15:13
There is no trick. We don't publish our fees because they vary based on our costs and our efforts to stay close to face value on products. Our costs change several times per week sometimes.
There is no spot rate premium being sneaked in. Read how it actually works here:

We are already working to help exchanges with Lightning solutions. It will take time, but we think things will look a lot better by 2020 :)

We offer gift cards for both USA &amp; international versions of Hotels .com, but please note that the target hotel must accept gift cards as an online payment method.
@_date: 2019-03-28 08:39:25
Please have a closer look at our website, [bitrefill.com]( we support most countries and add products specific to them regularly. AirBnB happens to only support USA for gift cards, but we have some countries with many options, and we work on every single customer request for products in their own country.
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:00:39
That doesn't sound right. Please send a screenshot to support at bitrefill dot com and we'll try to sort it out for you and for everyone else. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 08:11:08
The majority of our customer service tickets are either people using cards in ways that the issuer restricts, or a bug in a newer feature we have added.
Not sure what you mean about a card not working instantly. 
All costs are shown for all cards at all times, priced in BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-21 08:05:46
We've looked into this a lot. It might happen, but there some regulations that make it complicated to do in the way we prefer.

Unfortunately no

Coles opted out of working with crypto. If you want them to change their position, try contacting them and letting them know that their customers really do want the ability to buy from Bitrefill!

We buy them from 3rd party wholesale services, always newly issued coins, never from the second hand market.

We were temporarily out of balance. If you had a pending order it should be fulfilled. We had a lot of demand after these posts. Should also be in balance today.

Sorry to hear about that. Please reach out to our support (support at bitrefill com) and we'll try to help you sort it out!  
But yeah, Lightning is still beta. It's improving fast, but if you want reliability the regular on-chain payments currently work well like you said. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:36:06
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:58:08
I think you've misunderstood some parts. Coins in a lightning channel can be sent to _any_ address, in that case the channel will be broken, but you can still send the coins with exactly the same ease as you would a normal transaction.
That is unless there is a route to your destination, which there will likely be as we (for example) will surely be well connected to other merchants and custodial wallets, as well as a large amount of customers.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:57:10
No, your math is off here. It confirmed at the same time as regualr transactions at the rate of ~10-20 sat/B, it's basically half off due to segwit, probably 2.12 as calculated above. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:37:50
The Zap wallet works already and there are screenshots in the article, Eclair currently doesn't yet. Mainly because lnd which we currently use doesn't use the standard address format that Eclair already does. Once lnd upgrades we'll be interoperable with Eclair and other wallets as well.

Check out the new gaming credits we announced this week! 
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:17:39
There are several reasons to connect with our node. Our nodes are well-connected, so having a channel with us will result in more successful routing. We also offer channel services, so you can buy channels, capacity, or refill channels through us and our nodes :)
@_date: 2019-10-09 09:41:23
So, we looked in to the issue again.
The refund transaction we made, to the address you say wasn't yours. We looked up that address on the blockchain, and two days after those coins made another transaction from Bitrefill. It bought a 300 USD Google Play voucher. The email on that order is the same as you use on your other activity, and similar to your username here.
Transactions from the same wallet entity continued all through august and September, still with your email address.
We value your business and urge you one more time to review your wallet to see that this transaction was in deed refunded to you, and keep this thread updated with the results of your findings. We don't publish customer information, but if you'd like feel free to post the address that the refund was sent to and people can check the following transactions themselves.
We take pride in our customer service and the last thing we want is someone losing money for no reason or reporting we failed them. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:41:18
Coinbase does not currently natively support Lightning (like for deposits), but you can use your Coinbase balance and our integration to utilize any of our LN services to route value to anywhere on LN through us now.
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:28:10
We do not commonly hear about customers having trouble with Google Play cards. Each card issuer has their own terms and conditions, as well as internal limits on volume that may trigger them to ask questions. 
Regarding our pricing, it varies largely based on our cost to acquire cards. We sell many cards at face value, but there are also some we acquire at a premium. Look for more news this year about improved pricing and reward opportunities.
We cannot offer refunds on successfully delivered voucher codes, but if you have any problems with your order, please send an email to support with your order information.
Thank you!

It's not exactly fair to say we aren't transparent, but we hear you. There are actually some tough challenges with displaying BTC prices in other currencies across our huge catalog and international customer-base, all with varying amounts of experience with crypto, volatility, face values, margins, etc.
We aren't trying to trick anyone, that is for sure. It's also pretty rare to find vouchers from us at 20% above face value. BUT if you do encounter that, it's because we are also paying above face value to acquire the card. Our mark-ups are modest across the entire catalog, and we are juggling adding new products, improving pricing, improving the user experience, etc, constantly.
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:05:59
I think setting the flag to US makes it work, but I also think it is up to the receiving hotel whether to accept it, so you may need to verify for your specific situation.

@_date: 2019-04-18 11:43:23
You trollin'!
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:36:25
Yes, you just need to set the country flag to USA to get USD pricing when you make the order.
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:43:06
None of this sounds likely. We don't accept credit cards and we have long-standing relationships with our suppliers and a great support team. Let's see your order # and look into it.

Edge doesn't currently support Lightning yet, but you should contact them and let them know you are interested because it is already fully supported at Bitrefill.com!
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:36:59
They are indeed separate networks on the same blockchain, it's tricky wording such things. We're open to suggestions!
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:24:35
Spoke to devs. Lightning tx's are encrypted and onion routed so it's impossible to know which node originated a payment.   
We're working on a fix for windows, but yeah plz email support and you'll get help!
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:36:56
Right. This is a somewhat different approach for accomplishing a similar outcome! Cheers!

It's not a service we expect to be earning any significant revenues on any time soon, so reviewing it from a revenue standpoint misses the point entirely. It's done for the reason that proof of concepts are done - to learn, to advance technology, and if it generates us some traffic then that's of course a good thing.
The fees are there simply because opening LN channels means locking up capital and we don't have infinite capital, and don't want people to expect that this sort of thing will always be free. If it ends up being wildly popular we'll likely have competitors and a market price would develop but we're nowhere near there and nobody claimed it to be so.


This is mean and unfair, but more importantly it misses the point of why this service is useful. In order to \_receive\_ payments on LN one needs to have a channel with inbound capacity. So a simple use case might be someone opening one of the smaller channels for $1 to have a channel to earn up to $50 or so, and the bigger channels could be used by a merchant or such looking to conduct a business. Of course Lightning channels can also be reused potentially infinite times so there's really no good way of calculating spend $X to save $Y, just like any tool you'd need to amortize the cost across the number of times you use it.

Update: We've smoothed some things with delivering these vouchers to private mobile LN channels. Try again sometime! 
@_date: 2019-01-31 10:12:16
You can use Bitcoin Lightning Wallet and some other mobile wallets quite easily. The best part is [Bitrefill.com]( supports Lighting fully and this customer could get their phone topped up even faster and with even lower fees! There lots of people in the Twitter world and links online to help anyone trying to learn about Lightning. Good luck everyone, and thank you for your business!
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:06:20
Lightning is nothing like a fork. It's a cryptographically secure way to move Bitcoins on a second layer that is slaved to Bitcoin. Don't be scared of Bitcoin tech, learn how it works! [
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:40:46
Will see what we can do better for windows, thanks for the feedback. New service. Please reach out here or on [support for help setting it up or to get a refund.   


Good point. Our presumption is that if you already have a lightning channel working you would be more likely want to buy this for someone else, to give a way. We'll figure out a fix for Windows, and think about how we can improve ux further. This is a first version of an entirely new thing, please have patience with us :)

In deed, if you want absolute control of your bitcoins you should keep them yourself. "Not your keys not your bitcoin".
This is just a convenience we did to make it easy for us but fair for the users. And in deed deposits are usually not high as we're not currently a wallet.

Anyone who sells you a gift card can see the gift card code. Of course it would be against our policies. Privacy policy is linked at the bottom of the page.
