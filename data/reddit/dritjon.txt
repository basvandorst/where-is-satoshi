we're not discussing his morality though are we?
we're discussing does he understand economics?

the most prestigious banks in the world are wrong but that 2-weeks old account which said "HODL!!!! MOON!!! BITCOIN IS GONNA BE 50k THIS YEAR" is definitely right

are you seriously arguing that a redditor user knows more about economics than one of the richest persons in the world?
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:27:20

$7 per transaction is still pretty high compared to ETH, LTC, BCH
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:58:30
Im more familiar with eth, but eth does 3x more transactions than btc and fees are 55x lower
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:56:38
I admit I just started reading about crypto, but how is it most secure?
How is it more secure than ethereum for example (which Im more familiar with)

difference is: earlier corrections could be recovered by injecting a bit of money.
If bitcoin crashes from $4 to $2 is a 50% correction, but market lost just $2*21,000,000
If bitcoin crashes from $20,000 to $10,000, now the market lost 
Very hard to recover from that
