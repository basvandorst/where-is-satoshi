I tried restoring a backup from 3 days ago, but nothing happened with it. My password was 10 characters mixed capitals lowercase and special characters unique to my other web accounts. 
The backup file was on Blockchain's server, but I had one from 4 months ago in dropbox. None in email

Even if I was able to locate how that address obtained the coin, it's impossible to get the coin back without it's private key.

I did not use a second password for sending.

Yeah, but what's done is done. So I guess I can just either hope that BTC reaches $2K so I can make it back, or I can declare loss and hope it doesn't happen again.

Thanks. $700 was about 1/4 of my savings account and I'm starting college this fall. I use Chrome OS primarily when using Bitcoin, and as I said in another comment, I haven't actually logged in online in a few months.

My password was generated by my brain.

My wallet wasn't sweeped, because he left .01 BTC in the wallet. But he did somehow initiate a transaction of 99% of the funds.

I didn't log in to the web interface for a couple months. I only noticed by a notification pushed to my phone because I linked their android app to my account. I didn't ever use the app for outward transactions.

This game is actually in my home town, about 20 minutes away from where I live, but I'm in college on the other side of  the US, so I can't make it. I do have a lot of friends that go to UCF though so I will be rooting them on.

While I would agree from a picture and emoji point of view, my opinion is that the in-line the symbol should be vertical. Either the symbol would look like an out-of-place italics or a smaller font size would make the symbol pixelated if it were slanted.

฿ is a single vertical line. If we want a symbol with 2 vertical lines that don't overlap the hollow areas in the B, then it is just as different as the alternatives proposed in OPs document for the group mark.

When installing Bitcoin QT, it first needs to download every block of past transactions. It is a very lengthy download and takes up a lot of hard disk space. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:12:57
Supposedly because it doesn't do anything :)

I remember a Hibachi grill that accepted Bitcoin and for some reason the only QR code they had was on their front door. I had to go outside and pay since they had no idea how to use it.

If you have a small army of them and redesign the heat spreader, you could make a small boiler.

I have a store a stone's throw away from my house. If they start accepting, I think they'll be the first big box store to accept then in my area.

I'm getting a message saying their trades are not available in the US. :(

What about printing it on 80 pound card stock? 
@_date: 2013-06-17 01:22:14
I absolutely will. If I ever go to Vegas, I will remember to only bring a little play money. Gambling is not a good way to pay the bills.

I have a trio of them. Plugged into a Raspberry Pi with an LCD screen displaying the hash rate of 1.00735 GH/s.

Right so. It just takes too much money to mine without trying to profit. You either don't mine, or spend hundreds (or more like thousands) of dollars in hardware.
As it is (3 block erupters and an AMD 7770), I get 1.2GH/s combined, and that about pays for the electricity to run it and the cooling cost (as it raises the room temp about +5 F).

I ordered one of these the other week. With their shipping history, do you think I will see mine before the end of the year?
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:35:59
They would have been great had they been introduced a year or two ago. Today, they are a poor man's ASIC.

I did the exact same. I bought one the moment it opened, but bought a BFL Jalapeño 3 weeks ago. I'll see this one in a week, and I'll see the BFL in a year.

[MinePeon]( is an ArchLinux build you can load onto the Pi, and plug USB miners into. But first, you need some form of a USB miner. I ordered a 5GH/s BFL (Upgraded to 7GH/s) back in June, and I probably won't see it until after Easter 2014.

I'm sorry, I just needed to blow some steam.
