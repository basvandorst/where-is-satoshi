Can you put up collateral based on a verbal say so?

But that could be a senile old man's response to any question.
"Were you involved in the assassination of president McKinley?"
"I'm done with that"
"Did you walk on the moon during the Apollo missions?"
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it" 
"Did you go to the grocery store like I asked?"
"That's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."

Maybe.  But unlike all the other meme coins, dogecoin seems to have a strong community behind it, which is important for the survival and expansion of any crypto.

Out of curiosity, what government, if any, do you consider sane?  Is there a model archetypal government from either the past or present that libertarians hold up as an ideal?

Speaking as someone who believes that dogecoin has a real future in cryptocurrency, there is nothing inaccurate portrayed in this gif.

I think it is very telling that those currencies eventually collapsed in favor of a centralized federal currency.


I think this is exactly right.  While I don't believe bitcoin will ever replace fiat currency or even compete with it, I think it has a yet-to-be-defined role to play in the future.  Perhaps an important one.

"Community" seemed more succinct than saying "a group of like-minded people who actively develop and promote the coin by using various means of communication."  But, ok.

Yeah, while I hope this is true, I'm going to remain skeptical until I see some proof, given how hostile banks have been towards anything related to bitcoin.

Yes, staffed by psychohistorians who possess psychic powers that enable them to defeat The Mule and his galactic empire.

Sure I've noticed a few people saying that, but certainly not the large majority of the community, most of whom didn't jump ship during the several crashes.  Keep in mind there have been and will be other meme coins.  But for reasons I don't fully understand, dogecoin seems to have been the one to gain traction.
