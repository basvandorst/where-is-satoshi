Until bitcoin is divorced almost completely from exchanges then it's reasonable to consider the two of them together, if the vulnerability of one, makes having the other more risky.

So what backs the US dollar? 
+ it's long history of use
+ it's massive day to day use
+ that the US backs it, creates it, destroys it, maintains, allows you to buy it or loan it via t bills and the full faith and credit of the US gov't.
If bitcoin starts threatening governments, say the US gov't by tanking the dollar as people move to bitcoin, what happens when the US gov't creates additional laws regulating/outlawing/taxing/tanking bitcoin?

Whenever the price of an ounce of gold is equal to the price of one bitcoin, ask the nearby consumers:
If forced, would you rather trade the equity in your home for gold, or for bitcoin?
My point being that given the risk and discount factor, gold and bitcoin are thought of in two different realms by most consumers. One as a stable store and potential investment, the other as a risky flier.
Invest in gold for mediocristan. Invest in bitcoin for extremistan.

I understand that.
My question's are such a high premium?  
Why is there no anonymity premium in selling for cash?  
In any face to face, cash btc transaction, isn't the purchaser at some higher risk the BTC are phony or otherwise "tainted"?
I would think given the risk and the anonymity claim that cash purchasers of bitcoin would not be paying the online cashless btc rate.
I am trying to understand the risks both sides entail when buying or selling bitcoins for cash, face to face.

@_date: 2017-01-18 07:28:31
Well that makes a lot of sense, but as I've said, I don't understand why these guys are purchasing at market. The same reason for demanding a premium to sell should suggest they demand a discount on the purchase.

Ah! So that's new to me. I hadn't realized LBC escrows the transaction. I'll have to explore that, thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:53:09


there seems to be, that's why BTC needs various confirmations right? That's why there are various schemes to make offline transactions settle faster right? And make sure they can't be revoked? Make sure the money is in the account? 
I haven't been saying I don't understand why the price to buy is higher in person, but I'm also interested in why the price to sell a btc is market and not below market.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:17:22
Thanks, tonight has been some interesting reading, esp. some articles from a few years back about all the ways one can be trying to do the right thing and yet have bitcoins stolen from various wallets.
But it was also interesting to learn that lots of people have multiple wallets and keep them separate *on purpose* and there are apps to help manage that!

Thanks, I understand that, but what I don't understand is why the spread seems to be reversed, with a huge markup on selling of btc, but a market rate of purchasing btc. That seems contrary to the risks I think of these two activities, especially in person, especially using cash.

How many times can I restore the wallet with those 12 words?
Another way of asking this question is, if I "restore" my wallet onto my phone using mycelium, and then tip my uber driver 1 or 2 satoshis for his good service, will that transaction be noted in my wallet at blockchain.info?
Do wallets somehow naturally sync by virtue of having this same deterministic seed?

I've just done some very piddly sending, and transaction fees on a few bucks were on the order of a dime or a quarter. A very small exchange, but fees were quite high in terms of proportions.
Then I saw someone discussing a several thousand dollar transaction, and again transaction fees still seemed quite high. On the order of a few hundred bucks if I recall correctly.
So I have two questions: how are transaction fees truly determined, and how high are they for buys and sells of a hundred dollars to a thousand dollars or so?
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:28:21
Thanks I was thinking along a different line.
So I can't think of a reason I will personally need to pay multiple people in a single transaction, so what are the behaviors a "normal individual" might do to send his transaction fees soaring?
I was thinking of something along the lines of the reverse casino behavior, if I need to send $5000 of BTC for say a mortgage made from many $100 payments of programming work paid by bitcoin.
Would that do it? And what other things would?
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:15:09


So $7.50 is not a big deal, but when it gets to be $750 or $7500, on a large payment I know I have to make when my funds have all been from very small contributions, what can I do to reduce those transaction fees, or can it be shown that these transaction fees are on the same scale as typical real world transaction fees would be? (Because they seem much higher.)
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:21:40
There is no anonymity premium on selling? Even though, as I understand it, knowing who sold a bitcoin can tell you a lot about what they have purchased?

Right, but the problem was bad enough when Wiki claimed not to do original research, and required two sources. That situation still lets utter shit into the world now defended by saying "it's in the wiki".
Wikitribune is precisely an organ of original research, so it will be wiki but 10000x worse.

I wish there was a way to say, confirm this in 10 minutes or cancel it.
The money was to shapeshift btc to eth. It's the kind of transaction I either want to go through within a minute or two, or not go through at all.
Right now eth is $95 or so. Earlier today it was as low as $82. Imagine I had exchanged it thinking it would go through near 82, but it got held up many hours and it goes through at $95, a 15% difference.
That seems huge and an inability to confirm transactions on a timely basis would keep me out of btc.

That's right and u/zonky is also correct, still many of the complaints are along the lines of:
+ I can't log in
+ I can't withdraw money
+ My transaction is pending (for days)
+ Coinbase lost my money
+ Coinbase closed my account, took my money, and will not respond
Stuff like that makes me wonder how anyone could use coinbase....

At $1, and high fees dollar-cost averaging is literally not an option. With high fees and fees climbing higher lots of dollar cost averaging is literally not an option. 
With high fees, spare change is becoming lost.
I just don't see how Bitcoin becomes worthwhile to use for most kinds of transaction we think of as currency.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:59:30
The part that sucks is that unlike stocks, due to the high and seemingly fees, a person can't even dollar average into bitcoin.
It would be nice to just buy $10 of bitcoin every week regardless of price, but with increasing fees, it makes it harder to use that $10 on an actual transaction.
I just don't understand (I am a noob though) how bitcoin survives as anything other than a gold-like asset, it seems its future as "currency" is going the way of the do-do. And yet if it has no future as currency, there is no reason to value it like gold or diamonds, each of which has a fundamental use in industry or jewelry.
