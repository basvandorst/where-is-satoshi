Greater than 1MB blocks would surely totally kill it too.  Shame.

Can we merge mine on both??
@_date: 2015-12-27 10:09:56
I am seeing this across all(?) [P2Pool nodes](  I rebooted bitcoind on one of the nodes and the warning was cleared.
Is anyone else seeing this warning on their node?
I am trying to figure out what caused this and what it means as I have not encountered this warning before.  Anyone else have any ideas?
*edit:* seems to be everywhere :D

In your start up script, add `-n p2pool.io  -n p2pool.org`
The seed node `vps.forre.st` seems to be down and you are not able to find the network?  If you add initial nodes on your start script, it should find peers and connect to the network.
Try it out and report back.

That site is old and outdated; for latest info, check out

At least 1-10 TH/s is needed nowadays to even get worthwhile shares anymore...  Checkout used miners on ebay or such?
You are usually better off just buying coins and waiting.  But if you need a space heater for the winter and want to maybe have some fun, get an ASIC.

*Add this to the obituaries*. Or rather, it seems the on and off ramps are under attack, as expected.
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:41:32
Of course they are?  If it isn't under their control they must tax, regulate and ruin it.  
Also, this sounds worse than just banning online gambling...  These changes to the wire act could be used to shutter exchanges.  Speculating and exchanging bitcoin could fall into this.  Attacking the on/off ramps they are.
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:55:33
Yes pretty much. Thanks to the Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Acts.  The US is a shell gutted by globalists and the populace is too stupid to notice, care, or do anything about it.

The compromised brainwallets have scripts running on them that are sending transactions back and forth to themselves or to other comprimised brainwallets.  If you import the private key you will see something like  ... and there a thousands of transactions like that on these keys, with more every minute.

Yes that is what is happening, and to move anything from that address requires a very large transaction.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:51:40
It does not seem dead to me?  Just same bad luck, combined with some issues the pool had with the hard fork for bip66 enforcement.  Overall, the fork went pretty smooth though.
Oh hey, look a block! 
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:43:04
Understood, there are bigger things to worry about at the time.   The new icons look nice, I do enjoy them.  I was just used to the color a bit too much I guess.  Themes can be something to implement down the road a bit.
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:00:07
Would an option for different themes be considerable?  It should default to the most professional looking theme, and then we could be able to apply something different.  It is really a non-issue, I just kind of liked the old icon set ._.

It is a double edged sword.
The *public ledger* aspect could be abused. We are seeing this with coinbase and circle and their application of following know your customer laws... Entities will trace transaction chains and flag addresses they find questionable or just don't like.  They will go to great efforts in attempts to identify the owners of coins, and track the movement of them between addresses.  This is all done for *your best interest* of course, at the bequest of our *dear masters*.

Well shit.  You are right.  At the rate they are shipping, it won't arrive till it costs more to run it than it returns...
Are there any *reputable* mining companies to get powerful miners from,  that won't be useless when received?
