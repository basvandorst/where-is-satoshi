I agree. A lot of new people are now experiencing this for the first time, hence the weak hands. I've been more and more relaxed every time it happens now.

a good trader isn't greedy and will sell.

Sure, I agree. But it made it seem like tether was finally going under the ground and people believed the market is gonna crash and burn. That's not the case however, and if anything, it made tether look better because they've printed a lot of the new tethers after the subpoena. All Bloomberg had to do was clarify that this was in december, but they didn't until after the market had tanked.

They should thoroughly research something before dropping a bomb like they did, which turned out to be kind of old news.

«For tax purposes, the classification as an object of speculation means that capital gains are completely tax-exempt after a holding period of at least one year. If the sales transaction is made within the one-year holding period, at least a tax exemption limit of EUR 600 p. a. is effective – the tax exemption limit applies, however, to all private sales transactions in the relevant year, therefore relates not only to Bitcoin transactions of the taxpayer.»
Straight from that link.

Yep. It seems really easy to circumvent though - just hold it for a year.

What countries specifically?
@_date: 2014-01-27 01:58:42
Well if you could find the $100 under the sink, we could add that to the other exchanges, thus lower the difference by 100%, right?!

U wot m8? It's 0 pre mined and it's wealth distribution is comparable to Litecoin's.
Strong denial.
@_date: 2014-01-28 08:16:55
Thanks for a great answer. I understand now.
@_date: 2014-05-12 09:12:12
Dogecoin... No, just no. Keep that on the internet, as it was supposed to.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:50:02
Prove me wrong, then I'll gladly admit that I was wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:35:08
Why? It's way better in nordic countries.

I'm going to watch the whole thing later, but as of right now, I don't get why Charlie is trying to say that Litecoin is anything we should use. A change to scrypt encryption, 4x faster, and 4x more coins aren't really something that's noticibly better than bitcoin. There are other altcoins that offers way more than Litecoin.
Quarkcoin, for example, offers way higher speed (30 sec. speed), 6 times encryption, and basically unlimited coins because of the 0.5% inflation rate, which secures the fact that there will always be enough coins for everyone, whereas if enough people lose their Bitcoin / Litecoin, eventually, it will run out of coins.
That's a coin that's way more prepared for the future than Litecoin.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:49:47
Yup, you're a shill. Can't even name 1 thing that's good about litecoin/bad about Quark coin.

Well, I would never want to donate to someone that doesn't acknowledge the value of cryptocurrency. So yes, the only thing that's stopping me from donating is that they don't accept it.
And of course, Bitcoin would be much easier.
If we're striving towards full bitcoin-acceptance everywhere, why would we want to support someone that doesn't accept it? If they eventually go bankrupt, that's because of their own arrogance.
(Not that it will happen.)

Hey, thanks for the link. The "1 satoshi is the smallest unit" phrase really gets thrown around a lot, so it's difficult to know that it isn't true.
I'm glad that a revolution will not be limited by this, though!

Well, with Quantum computers coming up, nothing's impossible..

Why are you bringing up economic freedom only? The original comment said highest covernemtal control over people's lives, not economic freedom. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:23:37
They already exist on a small scale. To be honest, if NSA acquired one, it would probably be top security, so you wouldn't find out anyway.
This is because it could potentially crack the encryption HTTP uses, thus find out what everyone on the internet does, including officials in other countries. If they find out the NSA does, they would take action.
If I'm correct, ~200 "quantum bits" could carry a number larger than the amount of atoms in the observable universe. It's seriously insane.

Do you realize this is not Bitcoins fault, but fiat money through paypals «Fault»? If anything, it should strengthen your faith in bitcoin. I understand that its frustrating and discouraging but what’s the problem here? The guy got his bitcoins, as promised. You didn’t get your fiat that was promised. Btc delivered, fiat failed.

Me too. I bought at 5900, i feel like a good investor for once!

Good times. Remember the bitcoin ad? Magic money or something with the wizard. It’s how I got introduced to btc.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:45:18
I can buy btc on the coinbase app with a card. Any smartphone can. Don’t they have access to smartphones or cards there?
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:51:44
That’s how markets work... like, every single one of them.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:07:40
Lmao. This can very well be a bull trap. Don’t celebrate just yet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:40:07
Too early to tell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:43:39
Aha, gotcha.

I saw something pretty interesting yesterday. The 15 min graph and 2hr graph looked identical. 
That’s all.

You can earn a lot more than 100% if you short with leverage, and it is how people earn insane amounts of money.
