It's a good question. I'd love to read the answer.

I'm not saying people spend money on personal consumption because of inflation. Clearly people spend money on things they want or need. I was referring to large amount of capital investment. There is a lot of money in people's retirement accounts which is invested indirectly in stocks and bonds. With deflation a lot of people would store the money in savings accounts or store it in a physical form. Most people are not professional investors and don't have an inherent reason to trust the market with their retirement savings. 
I'm not making a value judgement. If we had deflation, I could certainly imagine a lot of people just sticking the money into a savings account and that being okay. My grandparents did that until my grandfather died and my mom took over managing her mother's money.

If you have deflation, people who have the capital to start businesses and create jobs may just decide to sit on their money instead of invest in new companies.

What is it with people that can't tell the difference between spending money for personal consumption and investing large amounts of capital into new businesses?

What if the government forcibly replaces the dollar with a "crypto dollar" that has features like when its received by a government wallet it automines another crypto dollar and puts it into the government account? And it keeps track of your real world identity if you trade in it, but they make all US employers with more than 50 employees run their payroll in crypto dollars? Dollars are also freely redeemable for crypto dollars. In fact the first 500 million that cashes in their dollars gets 2x crypto dollars.
They wouldn't really need to do fractional reserve banking if they could just have superuser privileges to a large forced portion of the money supply. That's basically how they got people on fiat currency to begin with. They could end the income tax and still have more control over people and money than they do now. Instead of raising the debt ceiling, the could just increase the multiplier as dollars hit the treasury. And they could have relatively small fees that pull in money. It could all be just fees to visit the grand canyon because they could make those dollars multiply during that transaction and other money is skimmed off of transactions elsewhere just to act as a hedge on inflation. It would be like the ultimate Keynesian system. They could fund UBI with that system.
Under that system, let's pretend the fed gets to decide the policies for the superuser setting. You'd want people in that job who are over 70 and have no powerful business associates and no children and are well respected in all quarters.

Since they are lying about using it on the ocean floor I assume it is a lie that it works anywhere.

I don't know the specifics of his case, but I do know prosecutors just say a bunch of shit that may or may not be true. I've watched them do it.
