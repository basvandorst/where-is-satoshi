This guy is the Nancy Grace of financial markets. I.E. Lost any credibility years ago.

So, when will it be open to the average European? Article doesn't specify.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:21:07
Nice. Thx.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:00:02
I don't use them heavily, but I've found Bisq, Loopring, Etherdelta. Not sure if any can convert to USD Fiat. Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:18:35
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:34:13
Not sure it's related. But if so; imagine what will happen to crypto markets Ellen the stock market finally crashes.

This is why you use Litecoin for small transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:49:29
Check into the SALT coin project.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:26:09
I thought about doing this, but decided against it. If they aren't as crypto-literate as you, they won't understand or appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:41:03
Keep learning about crypto's, and personal finance in general. Then yes, buy some and hold it for at least a year.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:33:01
So was it illegal just because he ran it through his business? I guess just go straight into your personal account and pay the capital gains taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:52:46
Heh, this is kind of what the SALT coin is doing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:48:11
Word of advice: your bank or credit union is less likely to report transactions below $2000 each ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:56:44
Eventually, yes. It will be the first true global currency. Although I think it will be a coin which hasn't yet been invented.
Compare the major internet players we use everyday: Facebook, Twitter, Google ...None existed during the 1990's internet boom.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:54
Did it come from the Nicehash breach?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:40:00
They're not alone in people fleeing their central government's blood stained money...
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:13:46
Yes, that's it. Just kind of like "Cheers!"
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:50:36
Do all three. Diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:38:01
I figured it meant BTC's all time high. Another altcoin or a hard fork currency will eventually overtake it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:38:27
I'd also like to know. Whomever is succeeding in this space doesn't seem to ever post about it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:24:37
If the final price will settle out in the millions...this is slow :)   
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:52:06
Fuck yes. Plus is decentralizes everything so our kids will also benefit, and so on...
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:27:20
Yes. Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:23:31
Compare those awareness and mania phases to the percentage of people who have partaken in the opportunity, versus the percentage who can. By that measure only a minuscule percentage of people have bought. To me that's still the stealth/awareness phase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:02:07
Dilly Dilly!
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:19:02
Heh, yep. I've found the link below fairly enlightening:
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:54:44
Sure it's divisive, but also true. Most of the problems we have to deal with were not experienced by our parents at this age. And the reason that's true often goes back to an institution which is largely controlled by boomers when they screwed the rest of us. Simple greed &amp; corruption yes, but the age bracket still applies.

You need exchanges in each country which can convert the local (Fiat) currency to digital (Bitcoin, Litecoin). Then just send between the two exchanges, and on to your bank account. I would recommend coinbase for the US. You'll have to research local exchanges in the other country. They may ask for photo ID for security. I'd also recommend sending in Litecoin for a much lower fee. Lastly, on the US side I would withdraw less than $2000 to your US bank account each time to avoid the bank reporting that as an income event to the IRS. This might still happen from Coinbase, but it's the safest way.
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:21:18
Yep, one is always bigger.
Wait, \(looks up.\) This is a Bitcoin sub. Oops.
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:07:31
Right. 3x returns in one year. Can't see it continuing to grow at that rate. The January crash was akin to the 90's internet bubble pop. It will come back, but will take years.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:09:32
We're just pissing into the wind with this one, guys.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:29:46
This is the first time I've heard "Bitcoin Boner." 
I will be using this every day of my life.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:28:02
That's a keeper you've got there.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:55:02
Clearly you don't understand how cryptocurrencies work. They are fundimentally built to not need a third party (gov, Central Bank) to work. You can't close Pandora's box once its opened.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:39:42
Same exact thing happened to me while dining with several new friends. When I said "you can buy $20 worth of Bitcoin," it was obviously news to the table.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:36:48
Bitcoin for politics? No. Blockchain to stamp out corruption? Yes!
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:59:35
Hehe.  The real bubble is the ICO's.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:53:59
This type of thing is going to be an ongoing headline. Crypto was designed to take the power back from the elites who own our legislators. In the end we will starve them out by not using their fiat anymore.

Thank you for your input. Perhaps this one isn't for you. [We have all sorts of other Hoodies, Hats, Shirts and Phone cases available.](

Nope. Manufactured and ships from California. USA Made.
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:41:49
Maybe it has to do with the end of the 1st quarter.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:28:23
Yeah I don't get this either. Can anyone EILI5?

I saw this live and loved it! Great to see mainstream audience exposure. I think she could have made the segment longer, but we'll take what we can get.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:40:48
I'm talking about these 300 guys, from the movie. They all mostly died. [Also, Related.](

So, sales?
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:20:12
It's "all of A sudden" not all of the sudden.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:10:30
How else do I convert my crypto to fiat? ATM's? Their fees are even higher.
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:44:10
I see you combined Shopify with Printful. [I did the same.]( How are you driving sales? Are you getting sales? It's frustrating because FB ads doesn't even allow crypto apparel ads.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:41:27
No where in the article does it say "law enforcement." It does mention and quote "government entities" for taxation purposes. Salacious click bait title.
