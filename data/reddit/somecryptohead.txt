We did $11 to $1100, then we did $200 to $20k.. now we will do $3k to $300k by 2022

No, but If you did that id highly consider talking to an accountant about your jaded thoughts re: what it takes to retire
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:37:18

“The money to be made has already been made” could not be more untrue. If you kept adding to your position down to 3k, you’d be in profit. Don’t overinvest.  DCA on the way down, hodl.

Where is your proof and source that is making you so confident that YOU are the chosen one to educate the people about this?
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:21:29
The TA people were *very* correct when we ran up to 13k, calling for a drop. Then they were very correct on the next many moves too. One single huge green dildo does not mean all TA is garbage. You can’t TA something like that. 
Quite the “grasp” for straws you’ve done there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:24:50
Tonight. Futures trading. Just don’t worry about it

Yep, i knew it was you. Was waiting for you to post. I saw you buy on the order sheet on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:26:49
Such heavy sell pressure right now. Imagine when everyone comes back tomorrow when the price doesn’t change :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:46:28
OMG THE PRICE WENT UP .4% WHO CAN TELL ME WHY? DEAD CAT BOUNCE OR BEAR TRAP OR WHAT? SOMEONE HERE KNOWS.....
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:46:26
The news has been saying bubble, crash, and btc got hacked every single day. Plz tell me what FUD in media will cause a mass panic selloff at this point of the adoption / trend line. I doubt the people standing in line to buy the dip will be patient enough to wait for the bottom. 
I’m ready for the moonshow, not the correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:07:00
Are you FUCKING kidding me? They added bitcoin cash to Gdax? FUCK GDAX

@_date: 2017-12-20 19:21:49
Definitely bots and whales keeping the price of shitcash up. 50 bch order keeps flashing in and out to hold the price up. Just like whales have been spreading sell orders above all 3 coins on gdax  to keep them down.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:23
Guys don’t believe the bch number. It’s artificially inflated by lack of any volume 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:10
And the eerie “moving” sell walls of millions of dollars suppressing the price of btc and ltc these past few days. It’s so fucking obvious

You got greedy. Simple as that
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:42:25
They’ll make their money when btc goes up. How dumb would you sound in the board room “let’s short it!” “It’s up 1500% this year! This HAS to be the week it crashes! We’ll be rich! Nobody is buying it! Time to short!”

Define “clearly a moron”. Maybe you’re the moron for being the one who says “it’s gonna correct!” Since $4k per coin

Of course they didnt see any reason, but now they do
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:21:51
Nobody’s manipulating anything. It’s just a devils advocate theory that everyone and their brother who didn’t buy last week are spreading. It’s fear uncertainty and doubt. Futures will go long on btc because they like their jobs and money. To short btc is playing with Fire. They will get smacked by the upward adoption and trend line 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:40:48
Thanks for the update South Korea!

You must not believe in trend or growth of a technology, and will always root for a correction so that you can say I told you so 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:47:49
Great idea. Do it 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:10:31
Correction upward. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:37:19
Because you’re buying and reselling and betting on the dip instead of just buying now and holding like a normal person. 
How can you not see how difficult you’re making it on yourself

Bye roger 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:26:46

Just buy it now and don’t look for two weeks 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:40:24
So what you’re asking is “will it go up or down”
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:28:59

Bitcoin is not gambling. No need to discuss. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:39:55
There isn’t ALWAYS an exact correlation with price movement to news lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:56:47
buy shitcash if you want to get rekt. 
buy bitcoin if you do NOT want to get rekt.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:09:09
Omfg seriously can we please stop with the gambling, casino, lottery, luck MENTALITY... PLEASE... 
every time i get off the phone with my dad. Hey son if you wanted to go to the casino we could just go to the casino! you should be selling!
You're a technology adopter. Not a gambler, not an investor, not a lottery player. You've adopted technology and the price is going up with adoption and trend. Until we get out of this lottery/gambling/crash mindset, people will have weak hands. They will keep worrying if they hold too long that they'll lose their hand regardless. 
I bet we would be at 15k right now if nobody cashed out at 10k milestone. I can only imagine the people sitting on the sidelines with their money in USD in GDAX 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:48:02
Futures fear already priced in IMO. There is no “big short” coming. Only a big rush of fomoers who will rebuy their sold positions. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:54:04
Shut up pussy 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:24:00
Limit buy. You would deposit usd into account. And set a limit buy at 10k for however much btc you can afford. And wait. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:22:28
I simply don’t mess with alts. Btc has done fine for and if I had alts I would have ltc eth neo omg and thats it. Woulda missed iota. If I had them all I woulda missed a lot of gains on btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:25:48
Absolutely. Plenty of people leave their money on the exchange. Sure, it's not recommended by pros, but plenty of people do it.

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:40:33
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:20:37
You are the market. It looks obvious to you after the fact. But it’s not easy to execute. You will lose money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:31
Terrible advice. Learn about it and buy ASAP if you want to make some money. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:16:09
News was already priced in. Big bad guys who short will get rekt by the trend and leave it alone. Then weLl be at 20k by Xmas 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:25:09
I’m worried about *insert common worry that Someone else wrote” 
Gee you don’t say!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:59
No you can recognize them after they happen and think “why didn’t I see that coming”. But execution is a lot different than theory with day trading. You will miss out on a lot of gains and not know where to set your limit buys and sells. It’s 100% better to just buy and hold. There is NO argument to this. 
Day trading with bitcoin is GAMBLING i don’t care who does it. Show me someone who’s beat bitcoins return this year. You won’t because you’ll never find anyone. You’ll only find people justifying their day trades by calling it risk management.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:01:36
Negligible impact. News hardly budges prices anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:59

Thank you for a well thought out and EPIC reply. Keepin it real with the fact that btc has a long way to go if it’s ever going to work. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:29:09
It’s been a bubble since $10
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:20

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:32:33
Holy fuck you hedl that long and still panic sold during that super fast whipsaw? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:24:07
Panic coins? Still up 10-15% from yesterday and 50% from last week. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:03:04
watch some andreas antonopolous videos about LN and skim the top posts section of this sub and read up on LN
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:03:36
Yup

Until it slumps 30-40% for a few months then we’ll see him panic selling 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:23:25
Wrong way to look at it 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:59:30

we're in full consolidation / flag right now 
Go to the liquor store, buy some beer, and get drunk until $18k
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:57:18
Lol I disagree, but okay 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:09
Kinda tough to bet against a b line for the moon 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:25:28
Haha so true. But dangerous. do not panic sell the drop and rebuy the whipsaw. Because you’ll get whipsawd 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:24:08
Probably forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:40
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:30:43
Because moon and yes we waiting for more societal adoption
You can buy fractions 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:58:17
Lmao? Ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:56:14
I highly recommend you start watching Andreas Antonopolous youtube videos. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:10:18
so its perfectly normal for market cap to fluctuate 20-30%, just like bitcoins price
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:13:24
That’s the narrative that is being widely accepted and causing this selloff since 17k (hahaha 17k). Dig a bit deeper into futures naked shorts and you’ll see quickly just how risky they are. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:21
Lol wtf? Spam. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:58:34
You have too much invested if you’re that worried about 1k and also that worried about FUD
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:05:05
Haha. 28 would be nuts. My unreasonable prediction by next Wednesday is $22k. Wall'd up at 20 and then breakout when the buy pressure and FOMO is just tooooo strong. 
Combine that with more verifications &amp; limit increases on new user accounts.... next week is going to be nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:36:18
Let’s do it I’ll buy 1 btc every day and we send it and split profit then you send me back enough money for the 1 btc and we just keep flipping it 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:24:00
Buy now. It’s been consolidating for about a week. New all time high incoming. 
-guy on Reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:38:52
They will pull the price from Gemini and other exchanges so you know.
I personally believe that futures will only have a positive impact. 
For them to load up enough btc to dump and trigger a mass selloff is pretty unreasonable. peoples buy orders will hold the Price up. 
Good luck 
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:40:49
That feeling when you hedl and it starts recovering
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:19:20
Wow such great analysis. “It’s most likely going to drop”. What a fool 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:10:44

Any massive pivot or dip immediately corrects itself. If we have a long term crash that means something has changed. You’re betting against the system

How embarrassing for their reputation to support such a pump and dump scam BRAND STEALING shitcoin who hires Russian troll farms to discuss the negatives of bitcoin on their own forums.

It’s not a pump it’s not a real price. Artificially driven up in the system.

God it’s so obvious the people who don’t own bitcoin rooting for a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:48
Not necessarily stupid if you are trying to alleviate risk. But you def will make some bad trades. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:44
You are trying to panic sell. Do not do this. It will be back to 20k this week 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:09:15
Wtf man. Instant gratification generation. YOU BOUGHT 8 hours ago

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:30:55
No it’s not market manipulation it’s a new coin with zero volume that they are launching. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:14:46
I would ask, where did they get millions of dollars in btc at one time?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:52:35
Lmao! It’s always the people who aren’t in who are calling the dips. So transparent. Carry on 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:03:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:42:39
yea. it's interesting. I assume many people scan reddit and make their decisions based on what they see.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:56:42
I understand. But they are still waiting for their Coinbase verifications xD

Hello bitcoin my old friend

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:28:26
Oh so you luckily timed a +7% at best sell and rebuy? At least you rebought. Talking to you is a waste of time, have fun gambling and spreading FUD that coaligns with your monetary goals. Btw next time your crystal ball tells you that $17k is the high I recommend not listening to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:48
Enjoy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:57:04
True. You’re right. I think “consolidation” is a better term than correction, aka “crash”
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:58
Ur talking about 1% 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:45:00

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:58
I think you are mistaking market cap for something that it's not. 
Market cap is calculated by (amount of coins in circulation) x (current trading price of coin). It does not tell you the actual amount of money that it is in btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:34:43

Who the fuck is buying b cash at 8500 right now...?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:51:03
What it means is that any short period of time invested is a gamble. Because you don’t know what it’s going to do during that exact period. 
Op posted it because we’re supposed to hold btc for years not make money in short term 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:55:59
If you want to get that it’s going to go down, just bet me 
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:57:10
No, you can’t
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:08:18
I’m rejoiced asf 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:30:29
Btc rocketed up 85% from 9k to 17.5k (I don’t count the Gdax euphoria get rekt wick up to 19.5). For the past week it’s been at 14-18k. I would call that a hefty 25% correction and consolidation. If you can’t tell the corrections are becoming tighter and quicker because of demand to buy and make money.
I would say we are due for a week or a couple weeks of growth now. 25-30k by New Years with a correction to 20-23k after and consolidation around 24-26 for a week.
Just look at the chart. Goes up for a while, consolidates/corrects, then goes up for a while, consolidates/corrects. It’s a pattern and an upward trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:42:16

You didn’t do that, stop pretending. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:31:18
So many noobs in here now. I’m thinking of getting out because of this. The entire dip can be blamed on emotional panic sellers. 
Fullautismal I assume you’re asking what happened because the price just went from 15500 to 14600 on Gdax. Well let’s see the order book was thin for buys and got sold into resulting in a quick dip  
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:24:41

Reckless as fuck. There are investors who hunt these types of things by setting large buy orders that low. If bitcoin were to flash crash and go down, your stop loss would be filled. If bitcoins price immediately whipsaws back like it normally does, you will be destroyed

@_date: 2017-12-09 15:41:39
While I cannot disagree about 'there is a dip coming' because there's ALWAYS a dip coming, I can brutally disagree with the fact that futures will cause this. 
The only thing futures is doing is causing people to freeze, pull their positions out, and wait. 
When everyone pours their money back in on Monday and Tuesday... well.. Let's just say that I made my reservation at the strip club for Tuesday night.

It’s ignorant to think you can time the market, so don’t 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:08
Insane, now people are listening to me when I talk instead of hitting me with what ifs. I think there’s a threshold of when people start listening to you. Right around when you’ve doubled your investment lol

No they won’t. They will want ONE payday and they will bet for btc and follow the trend and make money. And their careers will thank them. 
Or they will try to short, get pwned by the bull, and lose their job. STOP THIS SHORT BULL SHIT
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:20:51
You know in my day on the Internet, 3 months ago, we were flamed and banned if we made a shitpost asking the exact same question for the 30th time OF THE DAY. If I answered this question again, it would be way too many times answering it. And I’m just as lazy as you OP. 
I’m starting to wonder if bch paid shills are out and spreading fud, deflating the price of btc for futures, that way they can load up on sub-15k Btc for the moon show. 
OP, do you honestly expect to get a good answer when your first question is “ will it crash?” 
Regardless, I hold
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:47:32
FUD. You’re just spreading fud. 
Pull your money out of btc and join back in whenever you’re comfortable 
Btw sure a big selloff may trigger a stop cascade, commonly seen in crypto, but the amount of buyers will keep the price sticky, just like always. 
Oh and do you mean a 70% dropback down to $10k, where we so comfortably rested just two weeks ago
GET REAL
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:21:56
I thought it was more than 20k in ONE transaction
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:26:05

Because idiots fall for fud and Fomo back in 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:48:13
I don’t think so. Buy pressure is too intense and there’s a long line of people waiting to buy dips. Immediate recovery on dips is my call and continues along current trend of going straight up 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:49:44
All bullshit aside, try and picture yourself shorting bitcoin. Not only is it impossibly without a crystal ball, but bitcoin usually has very quick downward spikes. Then retrace upwards nearly the next day or a few days later. This is not all cases obviously. But a lot of them. It would be much harder to Time shorts than it would be to just hold and realize profits. 
I can’t see seasoned traders shorting it. But I’m just one asshole on reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:56:57
That’s was it....? That was the big short???

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:33:53
Shill/fudster. The demand for shorting is NOT very high. Matter of fact it is very high for LONGING because it's in a slump. 
Buy the dip, and come back and thank me on Wednesday.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:03:36
Last time it hit 19k it had gone from 12k to 19k in about 1 day. Unsustainable even in bitcoin. Now it’s at 19 with reasonable sustained growth. Don’t relate past performance to future performance. Just put your money in and stop worrying about every percent. Because as soon as btc starts going down then you’re going to panic and sell.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:46:21

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:16
That's because when a significant amount of the volume shifts to the buy side, it causes the price to rise dramatically. It does feel sketchy, but it is real. It happens very quick due to market buys and LACK of sellers (or abundance of holders.)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:00:38
The stress has to be terrible. Imagine Btc doing a 1k climb in ~30 minutes and you can’t even catch it without a market buy
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:26
On Gdax exchange you can see the order book and where people set their limit sells. There was a ~40 Btc sell wall at 16150 and it got melted in 1 second which never happens lol

IMO yes

You essentially know nothing about finance yet are making assumptions based on things you do not understand. I suggest forgetting about the entire thing.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:49
LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:53:38
Oh you actually wanted my opinion well when Crypto goes down it’s usually a result of something. Before you even know it you’re engulfed in a world of doubt and insecurity about your investment. Then while it’s down 20% it flashes down another 10% and you think OMFG IM FUCKED and you come 2 clicks away from panic selling your whole stack. Well before you can even get the sell off, the price recovered half of the crash, and it’s hovering down 15%. At this point. You think maybe I should cut my losses and sell. Now you are whale food. Because in a week, the price will have completely recovered and gone to a new all time high. 
You cannot time the market at all. Just like last nights intense dip, nobody saw it coming. Now if you want to assume anything is going to happen, the opposite will probably happen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:08:46
I would argue that demand is high for longs because of the trend. I don’t believe this is the week that everything reversed for Btc. Right now btc’s price feels deflated based on a couple days ago. 
Go ahead and argue with me but for the past year every time there’s been a dip I have said “buy buy buy” 
How many times have I been wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:36:58
More money in &gt; it rises. Right now more money is going in 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:15:29
It’s way more complicated than anyone can even argue in a reddit post from their cell phone. 
And we are ignorant for even guessing what will happen. 
But I already know what futures did to the price. It caused a 40% correction back to lower 13s. And now it’s going up.

No, it’s not silly. The chances of cashing out and buying in lower are very bad odds. Day trading would mean closing your position every day. You would be rebuying less bitcoin with the same amount of fiat every day, basically losing most trades.

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:55:02
Lol for what $75
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:28:34
Absolutely. Btc rocketed up 85% from 9k to 18k (I don’t count the Gdax euphoria get rekt wick up to 19.5). For the past week it’s been at 14-18k. I would call that a hefty 25% correction and consolidation. If you can’t tell the corrections are becoming tighter and quicker because of demand to buy and make money. 
I would say we are due for a week or a couple weeks of growth now. 25-30k by New Years with a correction to 20-23k after and consolidation around 24-26 for a week. 
Just look at the chart. Goes up for a while, consolidates/corrects, then goes up for a while, consolidates/corrects. 
If you feel confident enough to call an all time top on bitcoin and say this is the last all time high until next year. Be my guest.  But I always argue that it’s still going up and I’ve been right a lot of times.

@_date: 2017-12-04 23:50:48
Do you guys not see the trend???? So many people are flocking to bitcoin that the curve is rocketing upward. Any correction is just a minor blip fixed by insane buyer pressure. I’m not going to be surprised if we don’t see many corrections over 20% for longer than 2 hours. Just too much “viral” behind bitcoin. People are IN LINE to buy bitcoin. Buyers on the sideline, buyers in the game, buyers that can also be sellers but will buy again. Bitcoin is skyrocketing 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:11:13

You’re praying for a dip so you can buy in at a price that is psychologically acceptable. 
Why do you believe that they will short something that has only trended to the moon. If it were my job, I would not gamble and short. I would take the sure thing and go long.

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:29:35
I strongly believe that dips are going to be short lived and any price we see is going to be sticky as fuck and will recover quickly. because of the sidelined buyers, New adopters, etc. to guess that there’s a massive dip would be to guess that millions of people are going to cash out. Nobody is convincing me to cash out when I could miss the moonshow. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:06:51

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:52:18
Double agree 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:53:54
Okay. I'll repost what I Posted a couple days ago. My specific rebuttals to your original post can be found at the bottom of this.
These aren't 'facts' whatsoever, just my beliefs. What more can you ask out of someone typing on the internet? 
For the newbies, I’d like to make a post because there’s a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt in here lately. Here are the reasons as to why I chose to purchase more BTC at this ATH of $12.9K...
-Bitcoin's network can exponentially increase. Think about bitcoin as a social network, or a technology that is being adopted. As the amount of users grow and transaction sizes grow, bitcoin’s value goes up. When you think about how something like Facebook, or google, or the iPhone caught on.... it was an exponential increase. As price goes up, FOMO will only get stronger. People will take their money off the sidelines and put it back in. Many people are sitting back waiting for a crash that just isn’t coming. Bitcoin’s userbase has grown significantly proven by Coinbase's user growth numbers (hopefully they are accurate/real).
-Bitcoin is becoming less volatile. More people are comfortable keeping their coins offline, less people are leaving their money in exchange to make panic decisions. And dips are getting tighter. I think this is because there is so much buy pressure right now. Sure some people sell off and might cause a small dip, but the people in line to buy the dip push it back up immediately. Just look at the chart since the bcash bull shit. A steady trend upwards. The trend is heavily outweighing the shorts, sellers, and panic sellers who are forced to fomo back in at a higher price (I’ve been there too).
-Cboe and cme are going live soon. This is only more press for bitcoin. It is great. I do not believe AT ALL that there’s some conspiracy to short bitcoin. Why would they be wasting their time working on getting it on their system if they’re just going to kill it. Nope. They will bet FOR the trend and it will be their best move in their entire career. The “i Told you so’s” for the upside will far outweigh the “i told you so” for the downside. They will be pulling their price from Gemini &amp; other exchanges, which further legitimitizes crypto exchanges in America. To ban it here would be quite some steps backwards.
-We are riding a parabolic trend S curve on the BTC chart. And I am convinced bitcoin is on a parabolic trend, pushing to go vertical like it did back in the day. At the rate of increase we are at right now, which I think is about 1.5% per day, we will see 100k by early next year. Remember it’s only December 6 and it’s at 13k. Time seems to be slowing down but remember just a week ago when it was 8k and people were calling 12k by Christmas?
This may be the only chance in our entire spoiled brat lives that we get to be apart of something this Insane. It’s basically like if you could have made $1 for every user that joined Facebook, simply because you were an early adopter. Worry less about the short term gains or losses, and more about what the potential is. 
to directly respond to your original post: I think you are falling for the FUD about the high transaction fees and long confirmation times. The average BTC user is not using it for quick cheap transactions, they are using it as a long term storage/investment. This is important to grasp IMO. The average user buys some BTC, and either hodls it in the exchange until they want to cash out, or they transfer it to a cold storage wallet. In which case who cares how long it takes? Right now it's just a little slow.. Lightning network is coming in full force. A little slow transactions isn't going to stop the global trend that is flocking to btc. For christ sake the price has doubled in the past month. BTC's growth is only accelerating. 
Think about the GLOBAL market in bitcoin, rather than just the US. The whole futures thing is simply a new addition in the US. And there already are ways to do futures contracts through less 'regulated' businesses. Whales wouldn't trust them though but they trust cboe and cme. As far as the short conspiracy... IMO buy pressure would ruin their short contracts. It's a GAMBLE. They will not gamble with their jobs. They will go long, make money, and put it on their resume. 
That's all I've got for now
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:38

The trend is overwhelming the shorts soooooo heavy. Nobody wants to move their position to usd for the fear of missing on a quick rise. Plus it’s nearly impossible and downright dumb/cocky to think that you can outsmart the trend of bitcoins growth. Nobody can Time a drop and sure can’t time a drop and immediately buy it. Get ready for moon

If you would like to read some explanation written by a bullish btc maximalist who has about 10 years of financial market experience, look up parabolictrav on twitter. I’ve been following him a while. 
He’s very bullish on the entire futures thing
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:09:48
Well, sell half and hold the rest. What do you want me to say bro? You made the 40th post asking the same generic fud, “will they short??? I can’t lose my $3k!” If you weren’t worried and didn’t invest too much, you’d be sitting back watching the show. But instead you’re nervous enough to post a generic fud question about the best news you’ve ever heard. Maybe you have PTSD from other crashes. Millions of people will now be learning about BTC as legitimate enough to be on cme and cboe..... tell me how that is bad. 
Wall Street isn’t going to gamble against a trend that’s been correct for 9 years. Anyone who bought btc in 9 years and held is now profitable. So Wall Street is going to gamble and put their money on: “this is all going to stop right now! I’m sure of it! Short it!” No. They are going to buy the trend and maybe hedge with shorts. But they will buy the trend and join the gold rush. If they don’t, their careers will be in Ashes when they get trend smacked by the bull and face plant back into btc at a higher price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:02

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:26:50
You see that right there is exactly why I made my initial post. Because you want every answer handed to you. The questions you’re asking are speculative and you’re ignoring the trend and adoption by the PEOPLE. 
A simple google would enlighten you on hundreds of articles about btc being added to cboe and cme 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:28:22
If you make gains in a trade you pay taxes... simple as that? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:07:54
There’s no rush. Put the 750 in. Each day your limit will recharge a bit and you can put in a few more hundred.  
Or link your Coinbase account on Gdax.com and wire your money in, which takes about 8 days to get there. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:35:58
I refuse to believe this is a long term bear market. Couple months max IMO. My gut feels like it’s ready to start breaking out upwards any day. Bitcoin and buyers are impatient. As they see it’s not crashing back to 5k they’ll jump back in for their 2018 investments. 20k probably was a parabolic blowoff top but it’s not the “big finale” blow off where EVERYONE frenzies in because it might be like you have to 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:19:42
It’s not a traditional investment. It’s a technology being adopted by users. And a lot of users now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:50:47

Dude. I can’t even read what you write. You write terribly. I am quite shocked that you have 15 years experience and couldn’t see that cboe futures was only good for Btc. I’ll take the W you take the L 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:59:47
it didn't feel like it. Felt like euphoric FOMO buyers were artificially driving the price up, only to get rekt. 
But as people start putting their positions back into btc, volume will significantly shift to the buy side. Expect to see 16-20k this week
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:29:10

between 20-40% down from last realistic ath, around 16-17k. We'll see 12-13k and then tomorrow, monday, and tuesday we will see something around 16-20k

People are ignorant to think that they can call the top of bitcoin and I don’t mean a temporary top. I mean people who say “oh we are due for a 70% correction back to 6k where there’s support”
You must have forgot about the entire countries who are using bitcoin to make money. Next time you hear about Korean fud, think to yourself hmmmm they’re making money with this, I wonder why they’re releasing news to make the price go down??? Obviously to buy more and instantly make money when the correction is over. It’s a game. Do NOT fall for the game. 
In September China was potentially going to ban exchanges. But on reddit you would have seen people saying “it’s bull shit don’t fall for it” yet people fell for it and the price went from 5k to 3k.
It’s important to take notes about events and price fluctuations so next time you’re prepared. Since 2017 began  bitcoin has had a number of  periods of doubling, 50-80% increases over a week, etc. but every time it skyrockets, it corrects/consolidates/breathes for a bit. Every single time. Just look at any chart that allows you to zoom in on a time period of btc. 
Buy as much bitcoin as you can afford, and let’s make some money

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:08:01
I’m agreeing with the people who are saying it’s blowing off to 20-30k then maybe a recharge / correction. Or maybe straight to 100k. The trend is so nuts. It’s a shit or get off the pot situation. Hundreds of thousands of users joining the party every week. As they make money, they will 100x their original investment to make more. They will tell their friends. It is catching fire RIGHT NOW.

You’re going to get rekt. Just hold and buy more on the dip. Selling and rebuying is gambling. Why would they bet against bitcoin and risk their career on a gamble, when they can bet FOR bitcoin, be right, and make more money than anyone. You’re thinking opposites :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:37:19
16600 It’ll keep bouncing off 17. Maybe.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:59:09
Read my recent post. Also why would the government ban bitcoin when some agency probably approved the whole cboe cme. You’re trying to worry about the 3% chance because of your uncertainty and insecurity.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:17:45
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:08
No, it will not cancel your pending purchase. You are on the hook for 1k. While I understand you’re a little worried because 24 hours later you haven’t doubled your money, you’ll just have to be patient. 
It is very clear about the waiting period before you can sell the bitcoin. When you made the purchase, it locked in the price at the time you bought it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:35

Instead you bought a potential dead cat bounce. Not saying it is, of course the uptrend could continue. But we definitely could retest below 10k. If we do just keep buying more on the way down

I’m as certain as one can possibly be about it. In fact I think the momentum has built so much that it’s going to hit 12k this week and 15k by end of year. All from people getting their friends and family into it, and the recent success of investors. Even noobs. Once coinbase accounts get approved for higher deposits.....

no there isn't, and why do you need it quicker? are you going to be buying and selling every couple days? you'll likely get wrecked day trading crypto if you're a noob. you should hold longer than the 7 day period that it takes for the coins to clear. 
your other option is to use a different exchange like GDAX, wire the money in from your bank, which could take as little as 6 hours on a business day. Then purchases are instantly available.

The fees will kill you in the long run. It’s not easy to predict or everyone will be rich. You are sure to make a bad move or two and lose a large gain or make a large loss, thereby throwing off your emotions and causing you to go on tilt and make dumb trades. Just let it sit there and forget about it. If you need the fiat, then you’ve put too much in bitcoin. What if it slides down 40% over the next few months? You’ll shit a brick 
Isn’t there some type of limit for fanboys and band wagoners to say “hodl” god it’s getting so annoying hearing everyone and their brother with $1000 invested calling themselves a Hodler. The people who have a lot and who’ve been holding a long time are hodlers. Sorry
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:06:03
It takes a while to "clear". go to Accounts on Coinbase and click on your btc wallet. on the right it will show you your purchases. click your purchases and at the top of the popup it should say "xxx purchased @ $6800 per btc"

This isn’t smart whatsoever. Even super veterans would tell you it’s dumb. Bitcoin investment comes with very large swings guaranteed. You must have zero responsibility/bills ... or your “90%” is a small amount of money.

@_date: 2017-11-16 20:29:50
just do it. you're in the military and have a consistent income. when I first started checking bitcoin price it was $15 per bitcoin. I had 10k+ in my savings account. at that time, i couldn't even justify myself to buy bitcoin. Why? because worrying about it dissapearing or whatever and nobody just told me JUST BUY SOME DUDE WHO CARES IF YOU LOSE 1K, 2K, 3K... i really wish someone slapped me and said dude just buy some who cares about what other people think? if you lose it all, oh well
if i had the mental stability to hold the bitcoin for 7 years it would be worth 700,000

I personally think it looks good. I got more at 6k and 7k in the past couple weeks and I’m confident.
Clearing the transaction log can only help. And as foreign countries wake up to a confident bitcoin outlook they’ll drive the price up. 
Or maybe the complete opposite

I bought more above 7800 today. After surviving such a brazen attack, I imagine the btc investor scene is confident as hell. And analyzing past/recent dips it seems like the dips are getting smaller and smaller. With such an intense attack last week only affecting the price ~25%, Im not scared.

No. because there are guaranteed 30-80% swings. let's say you have $10k saved and you dump it all into bitcoin. are you comfortable with seeing your life savings go down to 3k for a few weeks/months if there's a big dip?

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:47:57
I think bcash has about another 300-500 to go down. I picture it in the $300-700 range. It’s way overpriced right now. I can’t see ppl really believing in it. I’m very surprised at the market cap of it
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:49:17
idk, doesn't this mean market cap would have to be around 150 tril? lol

Yes. Watch out for these big time. Just go to  and log in and change password and set up 2fa if you are worried about something. 
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:32:53
No because bitcoin is very high right now compared to what it was a couple months ago. 
Id decide how much btc I want to buy, buy 1/4 of that, and leave 3/4 to buy once per week or per month until I run out. DCA, risk management. Of course, it could just keep going down and down and down. That’s up to you to decide.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:13:45
another option is to increase your limits on coinbase, and use a credit card to buy. these btc are instantly available. but then you pay 4% fee. if you have a 1.5% cash back credit card, it's only a 2.5% fee :) lol

You were so sure of yourself yesterday. Next time remember how back and forth you were and how much you regretted it. The vault will help but you need to be less “responsive” when the price moves 7% lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:25:25
Did you buy your first bitcoin during the last pump and dump or are you a long time owner of btc? 
The fees and barrier to entering back into the market are going to screw your “day trading” trades up. It might not even go below 7500 what do you know ? Lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:49
no. or maybe yes. hmmm

I would say 10-12% fluctuations is normal. 20% indicates a pretty big selloff, like the first bch pump and dump. I don’t see any of those coming. Only confidence and positivity as of now. 9000-10000 is within a month or two I hope

I understand your disagreement. Let me clarify. The people who annoyingly chant hodl who make the same “should I sell” post as soon as it’s down 4% and then make another post “should I buy” while chanting “hodl hodl hodl” in their post

Dude, are you the guy I was talking to last night about the price not going lower than 7500? Cuz I can’t find that post from last night. The person said they were selling and buying back at the dip and I said what makes you think it’s going below 7500

I like these guys attitude who are pushing for wanting to mine even unprofitably. Although, that’s not the “ideal” situation for bitcoin. But it does feelgoodman because “a community who helps each othef”

yes you're good. coinbase locks your purchase in when you hit buy button. If you don't finish the entire transaction by the time they update the exchange rate again, then your transaction will instantly "fail" because you didn't complete the purchase in time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:36

@_date: 2017-11-19 19:06:41
So you went from ~$39k in net worth to ~$21k  net worth to ~$500k (you said you had 130 at time of bch fork) ...... and somehow lost $450k down to ~$60k .... sounds like you got real greedy with your trades on margins. Making too many moves and emotional decisions. Not everything in crypto news warrants a quick response and decision to sell/hold/buy. Just ride the waves. 
I see so many people saying “omg do I sell or hold”. It doesn’t have to be a decision every single time. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:31:27
I kind of agree with the pessimistic side. For exponential growth we need exponential amounts of people diving into the bitcoin scene. a significant amount of people, companies, countries, etc will have to start buying bitcoin. Are we nearing our maximum of the amount of people who want &amp; have the ability to invest? Maybe not. But maybe. 
But, then I think of it like this: if there was a specific brand of casinos where almost everybody wins money... wouldn’t people flock there like nuts? Wouldn’t there be a line with 500 people in it at all times? 
If there was a lottery machine that spit out winning tickets nearly all of the time, with some bad runs, wouldn’t people wait in line for days for it ? 
Now don’t get me wrong, I strongly dislike that people view bitcoin as some “gamble” or “lottery ticket” but unfortunately we’ve grown to a point where many of the people who are buying are very ignorant to even the basic technology. They’re viewing it as a gamble and potential get rich quick scheme. Have we grown so big that these people will have their hopes crushed, cash out, and never come back?
