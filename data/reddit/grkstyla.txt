I don’t care about price/BTC.. I can’t use it.. that is the problem 
This is not the first time this has happened, why isn’t there emergency difficulty adjustment or something implemented or even discussed

 I checked bitcoin ticker and I know it’s not locked in but it’s scheduled to get a estimated diff change of +1.92% and a speculative did change of -3.31%, I think these values are either wrong or not being calculated correctly because it won’t make much of a difference, especially waiting so many blocks for it to happen
I was talking to someone and they made the point that we have so many ways to hold wealth but that bitcoin was created for the pure fact that it is easy to transact, if it doesn’t have that what does it have?

Yeah no intermediary needed, the blockchain does a great job of withholding and freezing my funds
I lost my job and live off bitcoin that I invested when I was working, and can’t buy food or pay bills because even when I use decent fees everything is stuck in the blockchain...
Why isn’t there any core team discussion made public on their thoughts on situation? Can someone link me if there is?
I can’t even convert to another alt just to get through Christmas...

I agree with you, I am not as negative as you, but why is there no discussion on fixing this problem.. what is going on with the core dev team, do they not see these problems? Are they profiting from the higher tx fees?

open some of the transaction and check out the fees used
these are coming through right now back to back on blockchain

I agree, but sending it is so important, it’s like having a credit card you don’t know the pin to

Thanks for the link, yeah it’s been very difficult because I only bought btc and even sold my bch when it initially was redeemed after fork, in the future I will diversify across multiple coins but it’s very hard to see money in my wallet that I can’t access
I feel the main thing roger ver has accomplished is the community spending more time targeting him and the bch community and not focusing on btc development and issues.
Who cares what the coin price is or which one is the real bitcoin when the crazy amount of hardware and electricity on this planet dedicated to confirming transactions for btc chain is still not able to keep up, what about a difficulty correction or something...

That’s quite good, I have one 3 days ago with 295.837 sat/B and one more 2 days ago with 367.188 sat/B both unconfirmed

Thanks for the links, I have seen the recovery page before, but it seems that i would use that to move the bitcoin out of the wallet, but i just need the private key for BTCC not necessarily abandon the wallet

Thanks a lot, now I can sleep lol

I’m sorry, I don’t quite understand, your explanation leads me to believe that it should be simple, but I am dumb
Seeing balance on website vs seeing own wallet on webpage, aren’t these the same thing?
I use a automining service and in order to not have all eggs in one basket I don’t use their wallet I use BitGo,
I have it password protected and 2 factor auth, with encrypted keycard for each wallet
Should I be worried about aug 1st etc etc with my setup or do I leave it and go with the flow?
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:14:13
What about bitgo, is that safe like electrum, or does it operate like coinbase too?
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:17:02
Thanks so much for the detailed reply, there is some talk in the keycard about bitcoin retrieval using some tool they host separately in case they go down, not sure if that’s the same though.

Spoke too soon, worked it out, thanks for the help
