You are a genius. This will really help adoption.   It should be the official slogan!
Bitcoin. I figured it out. You figure it out.

Nothing you’ve said is incorrect but you failed to answer any of my questions.
@_date: 2019-12-24 18:40:14
Nice meme. So your answer for the Hong Kong resistance movement is a meme?

Serious question.  How does BTC help protect someone from banks and being locked out of the financial system?  What good is having BTC with no place to use it (ok, very limited places to use it). I can’t buy groceries with it. I can’t make my car payment with it. I can’t pay my medical bills with it, etc.  I know this is all supposed to change but I’ve been around BTC and crypto since 2013 and not much has changed with regard to using it. How does it protect you from banks and the existing financial system and being locked out of the system.  How would BTC help the brave people of Hong Kong resistance movement if they can’t actually use it?
Seems to me it’s main use is speculation as type of digital gold. When I want to use it, I have to convert it to fiat which is sent to my bank account.   So is the idea to store all your money in BTC (where you can wake up and be down 20%) and convert what you need daily to fiat?  Is this really escaping from the financial system?
I’m pro-BTC and not trying to a troll or be negative but I just don’t see how BTC protects you from the existing financial system.

Whatever poser
@_date: 2019-12-24 18:27:48
Wow your copy and paste skills are so strong.  How is this even related to my comment?  How does this answer my question of how BTC helps the the Hong Kong resistance movement today, right now??  It doesn’t.  
People around here are so desperate to be right, that they will post anything to convince themselves.   Try doing some critical thinking for once in your life.
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:48:11
But how do you get value from your Bitcoin?  The answer is you need to sell it for fiat and use banks and the financial system.  So your argument is the way BTC protects you from the financial system is by using the financial system?
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:56:32
I can assure I’m not a nocoiner. I’ve sold more BTC than you could ever dream of owning. I feel you are the real poser around here. This thread is about The people of Hong Kong and the OPs claim BTC will help them.  I don’t see BTC or crypto helping them.  Sorry your pea brain prevents you from understanding that.  Try answering the question instead of responding with comments you stole from someone’s meme.
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:50:52
I agree it is very impractical and therefore doesn’t offer the “protection” I see thrown about so much around here.  My question is how does it protect someone from the financial system like the OP claims?  To me just because you can use it in rare instances, doesn’t make its use case protection.  I’m open to having my changed but it’s use case is speculation, not protection.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:25:57
Or it crashes because everyone can easily sell. 
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:11:44
You are so right. So many uneducated people in BTC Reddit who can’t think critically. All they do I quote some stupid meme they read.  You try and point this out and you’ll be attacked as a nocoiner, buttcoiner, poser, etc.  You need to be a fully indoctrinated full fledged BTC fanboy who questions nothing and quotes nonsense or you are the enemy. It’s been this way for years but still sad to continuously see.
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:57:44
So your argument is BTC will protect you from the financial system because ‘someday’ it ‘might’ be widely used and accepted?  How does it protect you until then?  How does it protect if this doesn’t happen?  Serious questions.
@_date: 2019-12-22 20:18:39
Accepted sure. Actually used?  That is the real question.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:57:40
Hahaha. Are you serious??  Maybe just delusional?  Crypto Credit cards turn crypto into fiat currency via BANKS!  Who do you thinks processes the credit card payments?  Santa Claus?  
You don’t even understand the basics bro. Please don’t comment on things that are above your understanding.
@_date: 2019-12-24 18:21:10
Good points, thanks for sharing them.  I feel these are rare cases though and not the norm. Perhaps that will change or I’m wrong. I’m just trying to argue that the ‘run to BTC, it will save you and protect you’  message thrown around here is incorrect. I just don’t see it that way. I certainly don’t see any incentives for someone in the US, other than speculation.   
Unfortunately it is near impossible to have any real dialogue or discussion around here. If someone raises a question or argument that doesn’t fit the indoctrinated ‘fan boy’ viewpoint that BTC ‘fixes everything’, you are just attacked as a nocoiner. Certainly doesn’t instill confidence that BTC will ever be taken seriously on a global scale.

My bad. I misinterpreted that as being related to MUFC. I deleted my comment because in hindsight it was more hostile than it needed to be. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:45:28
Good points. Thanks for your answer.
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:43:51
How does it protect you from the financial system?  Today in this moment how does it protect the Hong Kong resistance movement?  That was my very clear question that you’re simpleton mind is unable to answer.
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:54:48
I’m not anti Bitcoin at all but I’m not here to argue with mentally stunted children living in their moms basement. I posed a question based on the OPs post.  You didn’t answer my question and instead with responded with something completely unrelated.
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:40:23
Again no answers to my questions. Just delusional comments. Sorry that you refuse to accept reality but USD is king where I’m from.  Maybe it works in whatever podunk backwater sister-fucking shithole you are from, but not in NYC.
