I m wondering, coinbase beeing so bad (wich i agree with) why there isn't a good alternative out there? Where you can buy directly with euro/dollar/gbp and so on that is ok?
(waiting for my sepa transfer on coinbase for 3 days now cant buy in dip)

As long as you put in right reference code you ll get it, even if you didnt do that right you will be refounded (i did misstake on code got money back) in regards to support i got replay 2 months after when it wasnt an issue anymore. Good luck
Ps: just opened post that buying on coinbase you allways pay more for bitcoin then it is atm
