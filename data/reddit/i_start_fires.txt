True enough.  One thing I would say regarding your original point is that the MtGox implosion highlights the major difference between regulated fiat exchanges and unregulated, semi-anonymous currencies.  This is why such a major problem is having an effect on cryptocurrencies across the board and leading to headlines about the unreliability of digital coins.  It's a pretty major issue that needs to be dealt with, either using some sort of peer-to-peer exchange security, or preventing large balances from being held for more than 24 hours or whatever.  The point is, there are real problems--not with Bitcoin itself, but with the way people think about and handle all digital currencies, and these problems need to be solved rather than ignored.
So I think you're on the right track suggesting that we focus on gateway market aspect, but I agree more with the first part of your post that we need to re-think the whole ecosystem.

I like dogecoin and I can get behind this idea.  Bitcoin has always been the serious coin for actual investment/profit, and it's getting legitimate attention.  Dogecoin is silly but it seems to appeal to more people.  I foresee a lot of people "graduating" from Dogecoin to Bitcoin as they become more serious about cryptocurrencies.

This is a good way of thinking about the issue, but emotions are raw right now so I fear your ideas are going to be largely ignored/spat upon.  Too many people have lost a whole lot of money in the past few weeks to look at 'the future of Cryptocurrency' with any kind of objectivity.
