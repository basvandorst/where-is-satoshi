Let me guess, they have to maximize CEO compensations?

Is it me or from what I recall all of the mentioned exchanges have been hacked in the past? Yet BitMEX to my knowledge has not been hacked but is not on the list. One can argue that they refer to customers in the US and BitMEX does not allow US customers

Oh boy, I have so many questions!

Yeah I didn't mention the premium on OTC orders for simplicity reasons,  slippage and spikes from liquidations when buying through exchange creates uncertainty in the amount you will pay eventually if your goal is to have 1000 Bitcoin now no matter what. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 04:18:53
In an OTC purchase you go to the counter and say,"hey, Bitcoin is $3300 how can I have 1000 Bitcoins?" And they give it you 1000 Bitcoins for $3300.  If you go through an exchange, to buy this amount of Bitcoins you will have to deplete the offers of people selling Bitcoin for $3300, this pushes the price to 3301 now, when you buy all offered coins you keep moving up until your volume is covered. 
Eventually you will on average pay more than $3300 for every Bitcoin. 
OTC purchases cannot change price, but if the buyer of this OTC Bitcoin purchase transfers these Bitcoins to an exchange immediately and shorts/longs he will affect the price.

It should not take 20years. The mempool gets pretty empty daily and your transaction should be mined in a day or two. Even if no one wants to mine your transaction ever because of the low fee, you can double spend it with a higher transaction fee and have it mined faster

This will help you understand the underlying math, its easy to understand without getting too deep into the math

ETFs and other financial products will do nothing to adoption. Yes, it might  be advertised and lobbied better if  markets have stakes in Bitcoin, but that's it. 
Itl go mainstream once the ecosystem is less tech/savvy and people trust it as a payment method. 
Bitcoin itself cannot be regulated (even Bitcoin Core developer's updates and hard forks cannot be enforced if miners/nodes dont trust the update), its built so it resists regulation!

Democracy has died a long time ago unfortunately.

Im not following...

We should not justify government's hiding of money on war, war should not exist at all at this point of time. Its just greed of the few pushing many to die.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:26:31
Conflict because of greed, and I bet you and me are not the greedy ones. Or even the Russians you meet everyday, or the Chinese that work in sweat shops or the non royal Saudis

Well, true... But the government gets an increasing credit line that will not be repaid ever. Its kind of indirect printing of money.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:16:50
The complications of the system hides the simple truth, that the government prints money not backed by anything. If everyone understood that this is how money is created, they would challenge the purpose of taxation to begin with. 
The increasing debt ceiling is the most simple example that no matter how well the economy does, there is no way/reason to pay debts.
If im not mistaken, most taxation started when government needed to fund wars (WWI, WWII) and they could print more because it was backed by gold. 
This is no longer a thing since Nixon 'temporarily' suspended the backing of US currency to gold.

I'm with you, but are you paying rent insurance and other living expenses with BTC where you are located?

Once Bitcoin adoption is where everyone in crypto-space wants there will be no need for Coinbase. Until then, people rely on the convenience Coinbase provides for converting Bitcoin to fiat and vice versa.

I cannot agree more with you. Unfortunately we have come to believe that government transaction is OK to remain hidden, while citizens have to be transparent. Imho it should be the exact opposite.

Unfortunately the land of this planet has been occupied already by the greed of the few.  If only we could migrate to other planets and start new nations with better values... We have seen empires come and go, unfortunately I think the whole planet needs a reboot at this point.
