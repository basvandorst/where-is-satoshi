No it has not workednas yet.
My money reached crypto capital after 1 month. 
I then traded using that money on cex.io
I then sent money from cex.io to crypto capital - to be sent back to my bank. Its been weeks and the transfer has still not reached my bank
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:09:13
I have just sent some money using it too. Lets see if gets to me.
Fingers crossed.
Fees were correct for me though 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:19:05
Are you asking me about money coming from crypto capital or from CEX to my bank account?
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:27:34
Large is relative.
How long has it been since you sent the money?
I had to wait 1 month for them to credit the funds
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:41:47
Thank you Eric for stating the obvious.
Please allow Google to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:45:16
Completely agree with you.
Infact cex.io are loosing their creditbility for associating with such a shitty site
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:04:00
Every multi million dollar company faces threats. Be it hackers or theives. 
By publishing a fake phone number on the home page of their website - Bitstamp are the ones that are coming across as manipulative and misguiding. 
I don't know how other exchanges work but these guys, sure are shady as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:58:53
Why should India wait for other countries to set regulations and then follow suit?
India has some of the brightest IT minds in the world. Satya Nadella (CEO of microsoft) , Sundar Pitchai (CEO of google) are just some of the examples of people with Indian origins running some of the largest firms in the world.
The problem with India is that they do not want to embrace development if a high ranking official is not getting a bribe. This is corruption. This is the reason, India follows rather than leads.
Bitcoin and blockchain are going to revolutionize the world. If India opens itself out to this - and Indian developers get on board - India has the potential to change the world.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:07:50
Haha true that. Completely agree with the risks... which ones would you recommended then sir, other than Bitstamp? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:31:47
"They have a central london premises" - Bullshit.
They have an address and phone number on their website - both of which are fake.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:55:23
Ya this is what makes Bitstamp more shady.
They have an address listed in London.
They have a bank account in Slovenia.
They have another address on their website which states an office in Luxembourg
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:13:12
Said no one ever...
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:53:05
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:31:50
They could have had anyone working at an office located at that address to pick up their mail. 
They should have mentioned it was a MAILING ADDRESS only. And again the phone number published on the website doesn't work either. 
Mate, most multi million dollar companies - if legit - will publish their real head office address and if publishing a phone number - I am sure it would be a real one.
The fact that their published phone number doesnt work and there is clearly some uncertainty with their  address proves that they are giving people an impression which isn't real. Don't you think this makes Bitstamp a little shady?
Well I don't know the British legal system - but any one with a little common sense will know that something isn't right here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:25:04

I have figured out that HDFC and Indusind do not want to work with crypto currency related projects. These are two banks in India that have refused working with a brokerage to collect payments in INR for sales of crypto.

Hello u/Sholtie,
Exactly like yourself I have been conducting arbitrage.
I thought crypto capital would be ideal for this as the exchanges that I use are linked with them. I sent money to crypto capital on 15 Nov.
It is now 23 Dec and the funds have still not reached.
Their support are crap!
They hardly answer emails. I had to send atleast 3 emails for 1 reply.
Before sending the funds they told me that it could take upto 5 working days but that was a lie as its been more than a month and my funds have not been credited.
I suggest you use another method, even if they credit my money I will not be using them again as their customer support proved that they suck.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:00:40
It isn't difficult to register a company and get listed with companies house. It really isn't difficult at all. 
If they were rejecting strangers they could have asked the reception staff to advise visitors to come back with an appointment. 
The receptionist and security both confirmed there was no Bitstamp LTD office at that address. I then told them that I am owed money by Bitstamp. They advised me to go to the police. I doubt they would have given me such advise if there really was an office at that address or if they were advised to ward of strangers.
Why list the address on their website when it isnt real? - obviously they want people to feel they are legit. Its a trick they are playing on our mind.
Also the phone number listed on their website doesn't work either. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:42:07
In India,
Do you know of any Payment Service Providers in India that are willing to accept bitcoin? Or any PSP that is willing to provide an internet payment gateway to an ecommerce platform that wants to sell bitcoin and ether?
This would be a good indicator of whether India has made any anti-bitcoin laws as yet or not?

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:54:13
Yes and the response I got from the RBI is that they are presently not prepared to get involved in crypto related projects.
We emailed them through their website at:
This is usually the case in a country like India. Unless you have a lot of money and are willing to bribe people, nothing gets done
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:29:01
They have shown the following address on their website:
Bitstamp Ltd5 New Street Square, London EC4A 3TW
I visited that address personally last week.
The receptionist at that office told me that there is no such company existing at that address. She then went on to say about 15 other people like myself have visited her in the past 6 months looking for bitstamp because they were owed money.
I subsequently send them an email asking why they have an address on their website which isn't real. There was no reply to that email.

Someone needs to create a way in which mass adoption takes place.
This means a program or app which can we used to allow everyone to use bitcoin as an everyday bank. 
1. The program has features which somehow calculate risk and lend btc
2. The program allows btc holders to invest btc and share btc earned if the project is successful

Trading stocks is speculation and luck. The market reacts to changes that we can't even think of. The community involved in crypto currency is growing.
 WHAT MATTERS IS THAT the overall centiment by the world population, in the belief of cryptocurrency being a valuable asset/commodity/store of value/tradeable derivative is growing.
I believe if you want to make money then ARBITRAGE is where its at!!!!
You just need to observe multiple exchanges closely. Im trying to build a simple wordpress website showing the arbitrage between exchanges but I just can't seem to integrate api's. Can anyone help?
For example: there's a MINIMUM of a $150 USD difference between CEX and Bitstamp all the time. At the time of writing this article the arbitrage is $195 USD between these two exchanges.
I have made mistakes along the way, for example; you CANNOT send ETHER from Bitstamp to CEX. I want to make this information available to the worlddd for FREE...
just need the support and time..
Anyone with word press experience willing to help?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:39:54
Not really. Just set up an account at your bank primarily for this purpose. I believe with commonwealth you can set up the account over the phone even.
Then start off with X amount of money as your initial investment and keep rotating the money through this account. Its not that much of a clusterfuck...

The arbitrage opportunity usually carries a $200 gain. The cost of bank deposit and trading fees is $65 in total.
Nett arbitrage gain is usually $135
If Bitcoin price is at $7,000 this would mean a 2% return on investment over 4 day period. Annualized that's a 175%

Thank you all. I usually think I am alone but I am glad that theres soo many others here re-affirming me for the long haul. I just got into the crypto world in September, and this present dip just scared the hell outta me.

ok guys. Welcome to Arbitrage.
So you need to register with 2 exchanges that show a price difference with Bitcoin or Ether.
Usually this price difference is in the region of $100. On some lucky days, this can even be $200. 
E.g.- Bitcoin BUYING price on Coinbase is $7000 USD /// Bitcoin SELLING price on BTC Markets is $7100 USD
1. Using FIAT from one exchange - ideally the one that has the lower price - buy bitcoin or ether. 
2. Send this bitcoin or ether to second exchange on which your registered with. Typically for bitcoin this takes 20 minutes and for Ether it takes 5 minutes. Atleast in my experience soo far.
3. Convert Bitcoin or ether to FIAT (by selling it) at the second exchange. Put the money back into your bank account. 
4. Usually we make $100 per Bitcoin. We loose about $20 in transfer fees.
Thats about $80 nett for a couple of clicks.
Please let me know if you have other questions?
Do give it a try.

Here is the reply I got from CEX after my SEPA withdrawal:
Thank you for request.
On our side processing of the bank transfers usually takes one banking day.
Such transactions may take up to 20 banking days for the banking system to process with your withdrawal.  
Unfortunately, we cannot influence this process somehow.
We can provide you information on this transaction after 20 banking days from the withdrawal date.
We appreciate your patience and understanding on this matter.
Best Regards,
Support team

Coinbase did not work for me however I am about to do one from CEX. Please tell me if it eventually reached your account? I suppose its been 5 days

Kolarkso, I hope your money reached!
I got a confirmation email from CEX saying that the money has been successfully withdrawn but nothing has arrived at my account. I'm getting worried now.

When you say 'us' - who are you exactly referring to?

I just want a clear scanned copy of the above documents

If you're new here, then I hope you have your seat belts fastened. This is going to be one hell of a bumpy ride

The law came into effect in Jan 2018.
If banks do not open their API, they will be fined.
I have a crypto brokerage:
Visa, mastercard and some acquiring banks did not want to work with me because I am a crypto related company. 
Does anyone know if my platform can now make use of PSD2 to collect payment directly from the bank (with the customers consent) without involving VISA/Mastercard?
