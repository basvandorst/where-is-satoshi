China is very protective about its currency. They protect how much rmb you can bring out of the country. That might be part of it too.

yes WU made the advertisement. They didn't consent to their trademarks being used in another manner. Since the OP cut and paste their advertisement, they have to at least have some print that states that what was created wasn't WU's ad. Something along the lines of Western Union is a licensed trademark of X  company

Did have the disclaimer that Western Union is a legal trademark of company X. Because every company that has another company's name or logo is bound to have that information. Even if it is just small print they still have it.

Not really. They have to defend the use of their logo or it can stop being their logo. You can't use the actual logo and claim parody. You're just using their logo.

I would imagine since Western Union is probably a licensed trademark, which it is, you need to state that fact. I don't think this guy did that. If a company fails to protect a trademark they can lose it.

Is that you're actual ad?  You used a logo you don't own? WU has to defend themselves here. You used their actual logo. If they don't defend their own logo they can lose the rights to it. If you made a fake WU logo you would have been fine.

You have to defend logos or you can lose them.
