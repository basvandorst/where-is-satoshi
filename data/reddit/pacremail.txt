I like how everyone gets emotional when we get a correction but has blind optimism and cockiness when we fly up 2-3k in 24 hours. Relax, this was expected, everyone is trying to do too much both in chatter and obviously in the markets.
@_date: 2019-07-03 12:23:31
Except your entire point is built on the idea that people care about btc or crypto, and most don't past the ability to potentially get rich. If that becomes too conveluted people will move on to the next idea.
Mass adoption, Joe shmoes and institional investors alike move on, they're not in this, they don't care, people who are realize they can't do anything liquid with their coins in this country, and a mass sell off occurs setting you back to right where btc was 5 or so years ago without any real way to push forward.
Governments don't need to ban anything, they can make it difficult and illegal to the point where the juice isn't worth the squeeze. Most people who aren't in the crypto space like you and I don't give a shit about this stuff, this is something you need to understand.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:04:30
Yeah most people don't realize this on either side of the issue. Most in the crypto scene don't realize if governments pursue the exchanges and throttle your ability to buy and sell, your only real option is OTC (local btc etc) and mining which just isn't viable for a market looking to push into the mainstream.
On the flip end most people out of the scene dont realize the KYC and AML requirements that most major exchanges have today and think this is underground which is far from the case for most users at this point.
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:44:28
Blah blah blah this is retard logic from people who have never had any money or anything. Only in this space are people this new and stupid.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:29:42
Again, how is this related to crypto? You keep making it seem like crypto is the first time the world is seeing anything of value. 
The reality is people who have invested real money into this or got in early will have even more real money and people who invested small money will have a little more than what they had. 
This opsec narrative of crypto being something secretive that you don't discuss due to fear of being kidnapped comes from people who never had anything and are expecting 6 fig percent returns which they won't see.
If a person owns half a bitcoin at 3-5k cost which is money for a lot of people and btc goes to 250k, congrats you have 125k. No one is coming to kidnap you for that.
People have watches, cars etc of equivalent value and live in homes worth 100x that. You're making it seem like people are about to go from rags to riches in droves and jealous outsiders will turn criminal in response.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:06:28
Gold is a hedge and btc is being seen as that too but if it's banned and labeled a scam gold will do, it's not as if investors didn't have options before btc. You have to think about it from both angles.

This is irrelevant and doesn't address anything in my point, I'm pro and long bitcoin and have more invested in this space than 99% of these subs, but I also didn't get to where I got to with blind optimism and ignorance of legit threats especially from governments.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:48:46
You're thinking in terms of people in this scene, talk to someone on an institutional level or an UHNW and you will understand quickly their needs are not the same as people on this sub who own half a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:14:31
I understand what you are saying but I fail to understand how my signicant investment in crypto doesn't put me ahead of 99% of the people in the space, and how those with even more money wouldn't be able to buy their way into it as well?
Slippage notwithstanding, as slippage doesnt work the way so many people on here like to think it does.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:13:14
Lol no, maybe you're talking about the top thousandth of the top 1%. And this still fails when someone can just buy up a ton of coin with their dollars because they are already better off than most.
Also governments could intervene by banning exchanges, but this isn't really relevant to your point, as the wealth gap doesn't change whether we are measuring in dollars, bitcoins, gold etc.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:47:51
Incorrect, theres no reason bitcoin becomes that product and not another centralized digital product. Our understanding of why things are fucked up doesn't translate into other people seeing it that way on a larger scale or caring. 
The government has done well to cover up the inevitable for decades and you can be assured they will continue to. I don't disagree with your pov but the idea that this is black and white is incorrect.

I understand your point now, but I think you can also agree this is an extreme as it would literally require bitcoin to replace fiat, whereas I think a lot of the major money that will flow into this space will do as a hedge/alt investment etc.
Would be pretty cool though if that did happen :)

I don't agree with this because I know the sentiment from a lot of fund managers, high net worth etc. They think crypto is bullshit and if they're told its banned because it's bullshit no one would think twice.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:32:18
That's the point.
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:36:18
That's right it's in institional money that won't touch this at the moment, you realize anyone registered can't buy right? Now imagine the position if it were banned. Now add the fact that joe shmoe can't setup an account on coinbase and buy. How are you not understanding this?
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:18:25
That's not how due dilligence works, you don't pick up the phone and call a guy in the compliance office and ask him if you are good. 
That's like saying you don't think every fortune 50 company did their due dilligence before doing business with China? You do understand we just had a trade war with China because the government (Trump) decided so, right? 
For starters, Coinbase was a tech startup and due dilligence is the last thing tech startups care about, securing their next round of funding is.
Coinbase has dealt in a non-regulated environment thus far and although I am sure it has used its power and money to get the best legal opinions and lobby in Washington it doesn't change a thing. 
The same way tariffs were levied on China and vice versa, if the government wanted to get aggressive with crypto, haulting the abllity to buy and sell is a pretty effective method. 
Full Tilt Poker had signicant depository money seized and was then considered a scheme as they could not pay out all players if they decided to cash out. This was deliberately. Bitfinex recently had similiar issues with its depository bank(s).
I am long crypto and coinbase, but the idea that the government can't make crypto extremely unappealing to the average person nevertheless institional players is laughable at best.
All these future expectations and pricing targets people keep throwing around are directly correlated to a large influx of money into the space. 
This doesn't happen if the government isn't on board, which is why you've seen crypto have such a difficult time getting institional adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:06:06
Again where is this overnight millionaire scenario you just described a decade or more.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:00:34
The reality is there's no reason why the products we know of and care about now (btc, eth, etc) end up being the dominant products in this space.
If the US government banned these decentralized coins off exchanges but still allowed them to sell centralized dreck, said dreck projects, exchanges, marketers, bankers etc would all be incentivized to sell said dreck to idiots.
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:53:16
I am well aware of how moving money around (laundering) works and why crypto is a legit use for this. The point I am making is the methods that exist now, real estate, art, gold, ghost cities, cash swaps etc still work despite crypto being better.
The implication im making isn't that crypto ceases to exist if a global power like the US were to ban it, it's that THAT would be the only real use case at that point. 
We are both pro crypto so let's think about this together. Why are most people interested in this space? Because they think it's the future and more importantly for most, because of the economic benefits.
Why has there been so much pull back from major institutions after the 2017 run up? Delays, banks pulling potentials desks etc? Caution. Now they are slowly leaning in because there is an appetite from an investment perspective.
What happened around the globe in 2018 with crypto? We sold off, why? What happened each time a country announced adverse news or an exchange announced it had to shut down?
Supply and demand is where this is headed, and while the supply is scarce if the demand doesn't exist because btc or crypto isn't viable from a legal pov most people aren't going to care to take the risk of taking on a headache.
This whole thing works because we believe this is going to grow, we are still in the infancy, ahead of the curve. If governments take drastic actions people aren't going to keep flocking to this market because it's illegal. They're going to avoid.
Crypto already has enough nuances and hurdles to overcome, the idea that a country like the US banning exchanges or the ease to buy and sell crypto isn't a bad thing is just flat out wrong. 
This isn't the drug argument where people like doing drugs, there's little value in an online digital currency that has no spend case and is illiquid.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:42:33
I'm not sure the point you're trying to make here and you're grasping at straws with your examples. 
You shouldn't run your mouth to the wrong people the same way you wouldn't walk around the wrong part of town with lots of cash/jewelery on you. 
With that being said, this isn't exclusive to crypto and again, this advice is moot to 99% of the people who keep preaching it.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:38:34
Binance wants to compete to be one of the front runner US accepted exchanges and is most likely going to offer a watered down "Binance US" version of their current echange in order to comply with what regulators/US government want.
Binance does what binance has always done in my opinion, what is good for their pocket while putting a clever marketing spin on it. 
Binance is in touch with the crypto space and understands how to pander to the community. They (CZ) are also smart enough to understand being a major exchange in the US gives them the footing they need long term.
The way I see this shaking out the US government will only allow so many exchanges to operate freely, so getting in on the ground floor as an exchange is as important as getting into crypto on the ground floor as an investor.
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:08:42
His point isn't off though, the reality is if government x takes their fiat and digitizes it, you essentially just created another and better crypto in 99% of the world's mind. 
It's the same reason why JP Morgan coin was created and even mentioned, decentralization isn't really something the average person understands because the average person doesn't understand anything about monetary supply, quantitative easing, etc.
The value in crypto is the ability to move money across borders with ease and in my opinion will always be. 
The Panama Papers showed the world a whole different aspect of just how much money there is, and what people that control that sort of money are willing to do, and crypto is the perfect layup for that.
Crypto becomes the next vehicle (real estate, art, gold, etc) for moving money and that's what the ultimate value is and there is a signifcant value to that.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:05:42
Yeah, you know no one with money, all we do is sit around and talk about business, investments, Holdings etc. 
Perhaps what you meant to say is people who aren't trash don't associate with trash so they don't run the risk of ending up in bad situations, what does this have to do with crypto?
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:12:48
Not really but ok, crypto has struggled to obtain mass adoption after going parabolic, a scenario like this wont help. Crypto has been around for 10 years people started caring when they saw upside and getting rich. 
There isn't a necessity for this unless the rest of the infrastructure becomes developed and that doesn't happen if something like the US government takes a fuck crypto we are banning it approach.
You need to step out from the space and realize that not everyone outside of us cares about this.

@_date: 2019-07-16 15:37:58
The point I am making very clearly is people make money from all different investments, businesses, and that crypto is no different. 
This fight club narrative that if you open your mouth about crypto you become a target is the equivalent of saying if you open your mouth about your business or stocks you become a target.
If someone is a criminal and you have something worth taking its moot how it was earned. Likewise if a person isn't a criminal to begin with they're not going to become one to steal your crypto gains. 
And again, this narrative is derived from people in this community thinking they're going to become overnight millionaires through crypto, they're not. 
That ship has sailed.

@_date: 2019-07-03 12:21:46
So essentially defeating the purpose of this better way to move money in and out and killing any mass institutional adoption, and any retail adoption makes sense. I am just curious, if the US banned tomorrow do you see the price of crypto moving up or down?
People in this space run their mouths a lot about how to circumvent if xyz occurred and at the same time beg, plead, and desperately pound their feet worrying about mass adoption. 
Mass adoption doesn't happen when the biggest economy in the world bans you, take a step back and understand the way the world works.

@_date: 2018-11-25 06:21:10
I understand the way markers work, I also understand the way tech in general is perceived and disrespected by markets until eventual adoption and acceptance as the norm.  You're short sighted if you think this 12 or 18 month snapshot of btc and crypto means anything, but I think we're in agreement on that point. 
I don't personally see btc as a store of value although I believe that's where it is headed. The tech doesn't seem to be there to support mass adoption as a functional platform. 
I owned fb at ipo I watched wall street bash Amazon, tesla and countless other tech companies until they accepted them. Bitcoin is nothing different it just seems the backseat investors and critics are more vocal on this one. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:59:49

Whenever I try to find information surrounding an event (bch war updates as a recent example) I have to sift through 70% fluff bullshit in order to find the information, ignore the authors position on it, and then corroborate it with 1 or 2 more articles containing the same fluff bullshit.

This is actually a concern of mine as well I appreciate the response. Their language is mehhh but all the pre fork reports suggested they'd be giving both. I really hope people don't get screwed. 
Edit: I suppose the waiting around game to see if SV dies off is what they're doing now but it doesnt seem viable if SV holds a value as it has been they will be able to get away with that. i.e. the current COMBINED pricing of ABC and SV makes up the prefork pricing, so to say it doesnt exist wouldn't fly and would essentially mean coinbase just stole hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars that didn't belong to them. 
Also, I am curious if CB is even in a position to just convert your coins to ABC and mark it as BCH on the exchange - wouldn't other exchanges all have to do the same? In other words, wouldn't BSV have to literally cease to exist across the board including all the exchanges that are now supporting it in order for that to happen?

Whether you convert back to fiat or not is moot. There are funds known as short funds that bleed money while the market rips and are heavily funded as a hedge on an institional level.
There is no reason to assume someone who enters crypto despite gains would cash out later. There's plenty of spec trading use cases, Long term hold cases, and in the furure that most of us foresee the ability to spend the crypto.

Regulation for the industry is legitimacy for the banks, qualified investors, fund managers etc. 
Regulating the industry doesn't equal decentralizing a coin. It means the regulating bodies hold the industry and major players to a standard. KYC, shutting down exchanges that are non compliant, etc and most importantly rubber stamping the industry.
Nobody I know that is registered can touch crypto, no qualified investor is being pitched crypto by any bank, most exchanges outside of the ones already heavily regulated in the US have a hard time finding a bank for their deposits.
Regulation changes all of this from day 1, and if you want a valuation anywhere near what the moonboys keep begging for, it's the only way that's going to happen.

1. DCA is a pretty rudimentary strategy that multi billion dollar funds use.
2. Your stop loss comment is hysterical at best and sad if you think that's how size players play. Stop losses should be left for day trader clowns that are over leveraged. 
3. Investments go up and down, unless you can point us to a market that never had any price fluctuations I'm not sure what present price has to do with future price.
4. Lookup what a J curve is.
5. The fraction bitcoin holders aren't holding up the price of bitcoin by hodling.
This was a nice way of saying you have no idea what you're talking about with regards to investments, markets, or emerging markets for that matter.

It doesn't.. the real bottom was 6k which was broken by bch war garbage and was unnecessary. Sub 6k pricing forces people to stop mining, panic selling, and even some long term money to take some gains and money off the table and sideline.
We can have that strange sideways 6 to 8k zone and build from there where you're not forcing people to exit and companies to shutter.
This pricing hurts too many people, and even shorting becomes way too risky here as the juice is hardly worth the squeeze.

Alts move with more volatility anyway you're investing into the industry so long as the coin is still aren't and isn't a complete shit coin this isn't really an issue. Eth bch and most of the top 10 will go up in value as btc does.

I doubt coops got hit mildly I just never looked at them back then so I can't attest and don't want to scroll through streeteasy and look at the historic comps. 
I am sure coops got hit just the same only the % might have been 30% off instead of 50% off because they already trade below retail. 
Coop boards have been known to block residents from selling below what they deem as fair market value propping numbers up (they are notorious for doing this to keep the value of their own apartments up and the building appealing). 
The idea that new developments and buildings were being sold for 50% off and NYC wasn't affected by the last housing crash is wrong is all I'm saying. NYC LA, MIA, SF all suffered as did the rest of the country.
NYC is not insulated from a housing crisis as its grossly overpriced here and people are already paying out the nose. The cap is terrible and the only reason it continues to trade is the backend value. When that is threatened people want to cash out and walk away.

The little money who bought in at that time isn't going to move any markets

Where do you see the stats for 5 to 10% I remember a broker friend of mine showing me a specific offering for a high end building in the financial district at 49 cents on the dollar.
I moved to Miami around the time and people were also in a similiar boat. I'm not saying the rest of the country didn't get hit harder but 5 to 10% is definitely downplaying the tier 1 housing during the crash.

Not as retarded as anyone still opening shorts at sub 4k levels. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:03:44
That's the underlying issue.

Reminds me of the earlier internet days when people started signing on and didn't know any better. There will always be a learning curve with tech. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:06:15
Thanks mods :)

A doesn't matter to anyone outside the community
B not even close, you need bandwagon hoppers both retail but moreso institutional. 
The real adoption comes when it's regulated and institional money can buy in without worrying about dealing in a non-regulated marketplace.

Yeah sure but they ship all over and device still needs to be plugged in correct? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:02:04
Yeah that's my takeaway from this too. Thanks

Not really we already were trading sideways for months from the low back in December you could have bought anytime in the last 5 months and been up excluding the last week or so.

Agreed 
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:34:56
So you mean the people who weren't expecting to make millions off of pennies have a chance of making a reasonable return - this is shocking!
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:52:14
Agreed

Institutional money does not need bitcoin, stop. This is where the elitism here cripples real world reality. Bitcoin and the future growth in value is directly correlated to outside money. 
The only outside money that can make moon dreams into a reality is big money, the exact money that can't enter.
Anyone who is registered in banking.
Any BB. 
Any fund manager that isn't crypto focused. 
Any commercial bank. 
The only UHNW individuals that have an interest in crypto at the moment are coming out of Asia.
To the second point you made, I see regulation as the SEC and most likely the CFTC setting up rules and requirements. 
I see exchanges having to comply with even more regulations and scrutiny so shit like Mt gox, quadriga, and bitfinex/tether don't occur.
I see KYC being required. I see merchants having confidence because it's easier to insurance crypto. I see custodial services becoming the norm. I see industry in general being able to build off of the legitimacy that regulation brings to this market.
Gold has regulation across the board, why shouldn't digital gold?

Big money doesn't work this way which is why this logic fails every time. The guys putting up buildings at several thousand a sq ft aren't losing their homes, they're looking for places to park their big money.

That chart is probably older than crypto

I saw a thread earlier that had an article showing price movements at expiration of the futures and the pattern, however, historically do we get a bump immediately after expiration or more pull back?
Can't find article now :/
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:05:30
Seriously 
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:29:20
Can you elaborate on the last part? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:20:06
Good boy now go sit down and stop spewing nonsense.

Website looks scammy

No expert said that you're talking shit people had price predictions based on store of value value, reserve currency, institutional adoption etc. That's called speculation. If the credit card warriors would have showed some restraint and patience in their buying this forum would be far less whiny.

I made 30 eth on a few trades while watching a movie last night don't confuse your inability with other people's ability. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:12:15
So accurate

There is no problem there, emotionally panic selling is a problem, not holding through a bear market. You don't need an escape hatch, you need patience. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:22:35
Yes but eth is trading at around 3% of btc which is a historically low conversion.
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:39:59
This can't be serious... 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:04:33
Lolol these scams are getting more clever

What does 30k have to do with the price point we are discussing? Shorting a bounce from a 1+ year low has the potential to net you what? At what risk? The juice isn't worth the squeeze.
The same way an asset becomes too expensive to buy and you don't dive in, sometimes it becomes to cheap to short and you don't dive in.
People like playing with fire and then wonder why they got burned no diff than those that bought on the run up last year. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:03:53
The user didn't use coinbase whitelisting correct?
@_date: 2019-05-18 08:10:30
I like this logic.
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:31:03
Won't we be due for a next one in 10 years? New noise I guess 
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:47:11
So short of having proximity to the device supply chain hack would be irrelevant? I ask because I have a few ledgers that I bought from Amazon that came from 3P sellers. I know shrink wrap can be applied, but it doesn't seem there'd be a point to sell hacked ledgers if you need close proximity.

This is a bad swap rate from eth to btc. Hang on to that eth and swap when alts go into bull at 2-4x the current rate.

Developers were openly marketing new developments at 50% off. If you look at the apartments that sold in NYC during 08/09 and look at  12/13 or 04/05 numbers for the same units, you will see the same disparity you see in any other market.
Coops already trade below retail due to the nuances you mentione above  and other issues (boards, age requirements, no renting, other stipulations, etc)
NYC Coops are notorious for having tremendous entry barriers in the first place so it's not really a good measure to go by. 
A better way to assess that would be the condos and what buildings traded for and the reality is most people who were neck deep on their borrows wanted out.
