You would be senile, at this point, to think any coin will have any sort of monopoly over the world population. BTC had that chance in 2014/2015 but did not have a solution ready, which fuelled the alt coin market. No coin ever will have that chance again. 
So stop the nonsense of "either it is a solution that serves the world population or it does not work" argument. 
I do not accept the premise.

Fees that are so low they are all but unnoticeable to end users and more importantly the guarantee they will stay that way.

But by that time we would already probably have quantum computing or very very high capacity, low consuming energy machines (I think). The population grows at a rate of 1-1.2% a year. Not significant compared to the doubling of computing power every 4 years (25%  /year).

2 questions I would ask AA, but maybe you can give your 2 cents:
1 - why endlessly increasing the block size is not the answer?
2 - Is it really endlessly? won't it come to a time where the network as no need to scale anymore and just stays the same size. Doesn't  Moore's law predict that the computing power will eventually provide the capacity needed, the same way in 2013 you would require a 500$ laptop to perform what now can be done by a 25$ raspberry pi?  
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:30:34
Even if Moore's Law is slowing down, hardware will keep evolving. Those 1:30 may be 20 seconds in 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:53:11
 Although Litecoin's fees are low by most payment system standards, they are not low enough to support native micropayments.
Furthermore, the Litecoin community has a philosophical overlap with Bitcoin and is not committed to on-chain scaling. The Bitcoin Cash community, by contrast, is fully committed to on-chain scaling and intends to increase the block size as needed in order to ensure that fees remain low. This is a critical difference.

The challenge is not the name. The challenge is to create a new protocol and get 51% to run nods on that protocol. Which in these days is virtually impossible. Today the main protocol used is "Bitcoin Core", but people don't include "core" in the name because it's the main chain. If you can hijack it with a better solution, your solution becomes known as just Bitcoin, and theirs would be considered "Bitcoin Core". So it's a matter of popularity. The most popular gets to use just "Bitcoin". It was designed for the best solution to prevail, but it was obviously hijacked by some really scummy dudes.

Well those printers were needles with ink... then came jetprinters, then laser printers, etc. Why would 3D printers be stuck to plastic?

@_date: 2018-05-02 11:44:04
Exactly. It they lost majority they would have to find a name for that chain. That chain would be called Bitcoin Core. And the new consensus previously known as "Bitcoin Idea Whatever" would be known as just "Bitcoin" for the time they had majority. If they lost majority they would go back to being called "Bitcoin Idea Whatever".

If all you got is a 4 year-old piece from a source nobody knows... let's see it.
In big letters generally a piece reveals the main ideas behind it. This is what they highlighted:


at Munich Airport in 
1999 photographing 
himself inside planes 
parked on the tarmac, 
apparently in a bid to 
boost his claim that he 
owned a private jet
Such a criminal mind...


be attracted to him as he squired a cluster of pals around the 
Caribbean in a rented yacht he hopes we’ll think he owns
He should get life for that.
Also they've been targeting him for a long time:


Yes, he was involved in hacking when he was underage.... 20+ years ago when he was a teen. Give him a break already?
And yes, apparently he was involved in stock manipulation price, he was sentenced and paid a big fine. Wall street 1, Kim 0. 
They never do that over there in Wall Street. Shocker.

It has the potential of becoming a currency and its potential is very strong on the internet. For day-to-day real purchases I don't know, but hey, we all knew in the 90's that one day internet would be wireless, we just didn't know how, we just knew it would. I wouldn't be too worried about the "how" at this time, but with the right tech development it has potential to achieve great things as a currency.
Also, Kim Dotcom has been saying he plans to encrypt half the internet in the short-middle term and [yesterday he told Max Keiser he is getting ready to launch]( I think Megacoin can become a relevant player if he succeeds.

You simply do what Louis Ck did in 2011 with his special.
You do a gig, film it and sell it for 5 bucks (not 20 bucks on a DVD release so that publishers get their 85% share).
 You know how much he made with this model of distribution?  $1.34 million. And yes, it was on the top downloads of Piratebay and basically everywhere.

There are degrees of certainty that can make a statement so close to true that you can't say they are lying, because it is a word that is used when somebody is saying something that is opposed to truth.

....and you're still giving advise to millionaires. Like, you really don't see it that the decision of doing the absolute opposite was successful.
Most of them are geeks who made it BIG time exactly for not knowing better. Your knowledge made you less money in this particular case. That is the entire question, that you are not getting. I already admitted that for everything else you are right about risk management. Like Alessio Rastani, if he doesn't admit that he was wrong by telling everyone BTC was a ponzi, for his viewers to not invest. I mean, now the viewers see all these rich bitcoin kids, look at Rastani and think: "Will he ever mention bitcoin or at least admit he was wrong on THIS one?"


If you think my example of a guy selling you the winning ticket in the street and you facing a binary decision (50%) has something to do with actually playing the lottery, than you really didn't get the example. You had a 50-50 decision, sell or not sell. Winning big one time decision vs. winning small decision regularly. You have treated BTC like oil or gold, when voices were already saying this was special and unseen to our world. You chose to ignore those voices and those voices now might be echoing in a penthouse. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:23:01

@_date: 2017-02-25 19:01:23
Shame you didn't see that bitcoin is something unseen and unheard of to mankind, as some of us here.  


There is a thing called "putting your money where your mouth is". So if those people in 2011 did put their money where their mouths were, you don't say they were full of shit because there's no way they could know. Of course nobody here is Nostradamus and "knows", that's a naughty premise to base your case. You simply say they were right and you were wrong. Or better put, they've used a successful system tailored for Bitcoin investment (the ol' hodl) and you've used a disastrous system not tailored for Bitcoin (pre-defined trading ideology).
Like Alessio Rastani, and others, you didn't see the big picture at the time and stuck to markets mentality.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:08:14
That is the thing. It does make you money outside of that decision. But if you have to bring that up, I think you know you're decision doesn't stand up on its own. 
 We are talking about BTC only. Comparing only one single action you are defending vs. the action of hodlers. 
Why would you regret it, right? Either you aren't aware that in some cases this single action made people millionaires or you are really not in this for the money but for the discipline. 
In real life that would be the equivalent of seeing everyone around in ferraris and keep thinking "I did the right decision. Long term baby! I'll beat the other commodities trade and make a comfortable living".  Repeating the mantra of resignation and denial. Whatever works for you, mate.
Imagine we are walking in the street with someone. The 3 of us are approached by a guy trying to sell a winning lottery ticket in the street for 50$. You and me didn't believe in him and the guy that was with us bought it because he had more information, or the numbers sounded familiar to him, or he had the hunch that the guy was telling the truth. As soon as he cashed the sweet millions in that ticket I would say: Shit, should have bought that ticket ohhh nooo, just had a once in a lifetime opportunity! ahhh! 
...You would say: Buying lottery tickets in the street is not EV+ I regreat nothing. 
Well, sometimes you just need to be right once and you retire. Then EV is irrelevant.
That's called being really really right (or lucky - doesn't matter, if you're talking about ISOLATED events). 
Like 10 000 BTC for a pizza sounded reasonable. That guy has zip-hole now instead of 10 million. He can still argue the pizza was delicious and it was worth the btc at the time and he would be right. If he does not at least admits that if he had a time machine he would do it differently then it would a plain idiot statement. Almost as idiot as:

If you are into bitcoin and cryptography you should familiarize yourself with the concept of negligibility. The odds of the sun not rising tomorrow are small enough or unimportant enough to be neglected, therefore negligible. Any event facing such odds is normally referred to in any non-conceptual language as "certainties".
If by saying "see you tomorrow" you are labeling me as a liar you should check your language skills, seriously. 
Edit: Even if I gave it to you that technically I am lying, even then, "speculating" would be a more accurate term.

No, not even 1 year, because now there are 3 or 4 really strong candidates with really good features. If ETF gets denied, we will see BTC turning into LTC: No functionality or usage other than markets.

If you have "buy back" as a end plan, than you believe it will go up in the long term, so you just want to play with risk. Holding (vs. selling at some random fetish number like 2500) is a better plan. 
Imagine you begin selling  for no particular reason. If you are wrong when will you stop that process of selling? When it reaches 3000?
If you just hold you don't risk anything (if you are set on long term) but you eliminate that possible extra fiat from a hunch, yes, but still, not tempting enough, because it does not have any solid basis. 
You might just get stuck with that fiat and having to wait for a fall that never comes to buy back. 
You either trade or you don't trade. Making those type of one off trade because of a suppose pattern will be costly most of the time and even deadly, depending on how much you sell and how late you re-invest. 
If you want to convert BTC to fiat with a guaranteed profit, sell it at a 6/7% markup to other people. That is the only 100% proven way to make money selling btc.

Few people holding too much coins. 
What good is decentralization when the economy of it starts almost as unbalanced as fiat ended. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:03:04
I agree. But today admittedly a btc=x $.
Imagine in 10 years a burger costing 500$ because the dolar becomes worthless. 1 btc being worth $1M is a consequence of both btc growth and fiat weakening. 
Where I'm trying to get at is when would we stop caring how much dollars a btc is worth and how would we quantify what is btc strengthening and what is $ collapse . I'm interested in the process, not the end result. The process might take a considerable amount of time transitioning and I haven't heard much about how ppl envision this delicate period on a macro scale. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:46:51
Good ideas shared, thanks. 
Governments should have no problem with bitcoin. Banks have a problem. The federal reserve has a problem.
If I want to become a drug dealer, buy weapons on the black market, pay for a prostitute, etc I can do so by using cash.
If I go anywhere to buy goods and services and pay cash, government gets its taxes. So it shouldn't be different if I pay BTC. 
Blockchain technology will make banks the telegraphs of the XXI century...useless. As for goverments, their role is not threatened, it might change a bit here and there, but not drastically. It's the equivalent to bringing the gold standard back. That's what BTC will do. Getting rid of the gold standard was the begining of the end of fiat currencies and the monetary system as we know it. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:42:53
If you want to buy BTC now with fiat you need to buy it from someone, at a markup. 
Set shop. Be that guy that sells. 
That's the only way I know that 100% of times makes money selling BTC for fiat. 
Everything else is speculation.

I do share almost all your points of view, but with a tenth of the blindness. 
I don't care what the new kid on the block is trying to do. All I care is how I can benefit from it. Slander never stooped anyone. It is a complete waste of energy. Like holding signs in the street. 
You resemble the banks talking about Bitcoin 3 years ago. 
Now their tune as changed and want to be in the blockchain. 
So why not skip that entire step of useless slender and get down to the actual reality.

I keep wanting to switch this off but then I read


and I see $19,848,915,352 held by nobody and get intrigued by your denial.  
I'll keep examining cash as the test tube it is. No bad comes from that. 
Again, they are not bitcoin. Bitcoin is descentralized, as it should,  yada yada. Maybe there's a group of people who wants to try the CEO model. Why the outrage? Oh then call yourselves something else! Oh they'll trick the noobs..Yeah back to the circular argument.
You look like Muslims talking about "infidels".
I'm not advocating for cash. I'm advocating it's healthy to have an entity biting your heels. And I don't even care what that entity is doing. But if it's going to make me better in the long run, than I want to aknowledge it. It as always been in any service industry. It's not about crypto, it's about human nature.
...And some of that energy comes from hating the other side and I'm ok that you are a part of that branch of people that usually exists on the opposing sides. 
Somehow you were expecting Bitcoin to be the first "thing" with no competition to ever exist in the history of the world and now you're waking up to the reality that although BTC is the one and only BTC, it can be replicated to a lower standard version. And you're in denial about it. Scared even, it seems. 
It's gonn' be ok. Daddy's here. shhh shhh

@_date: 2017-11-20 16:43:50
I understand it's delicate but not crucial. But I don't think the approach of treating "Bitcoin" as fiat treats "Dolar" to be a big issue. If you go to an Exchange and you ask for dollars, you don't need to know that there is a Surinamese dollar, a Fijian dollar, Namibian dollar or Tuvaluan dollar, most people don't. But if you can't tell the difference between Canadian dollar and American dollar or if you think that all dollars are the same thing, there's clearly some space for improvement on your basic knowledge about money. Going forward I expect Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to be highly distinctable and common sense stuff. 
Out of curiosity, what's your opinion on "Ethereum Classic" naming? I think that one is even more blatantly misleading and I don't see any outrage from Ethereum community.

I think Iphone is a scam because a phone made in China is not worth 1000$ + schedulled obsolence. Guess what, Apple is the biggest company in the planet. Are those things healthy? No. Do people care? The free market says no. 
 Free market is healthy. What you do within the free markets is dog eat dog. It's like free speech and the cliche "I don't agree with what you say but will fight for your right to say it". I don't agree with BitcoinCash tactics, but I will defend their right to compete and make their thing. 
And by the way I know their plans and the parity ordeal. I don't have trust issues there. Not going to happen, ever.
You let the kids play. You let them try. You let them fail. You let them learn. Free markets are like nature. Only the strongest survives.

Let me give you an exercise. 
Imagine this scenario (just for the sake of argument):

 BCH
 LTC
Explain me the importance of not being an alt-coin in this scenario.

What I meant was I share the same point of views in a 1:10 intensity. So I'm not saying you are wrong. That does not mean there's no space for other people to be right with a different set of ideas in this space. I come from a country where people go to the soccer games and before and after the game if they encounter people from the opposing team in the streets they just kick the shit out of 'em for no good reason. This usually happens between the clubs that are  and  Nobody gives a fuck when the  comes to town. It's only when you are disputing  that tensions rise. Oh and in my country some clubs have very similar names, but who gives a fuck. (Desportivo de Chaves, Desportivo de Aves, Sporting Clube Portugal, Sporting Clube Braga, Futebol Clube do Porto, Futebol Clube de Arouca, etc)
In the TV broadcast usually, the commentators say what other clubs from around the world requested a pass to send their scouts to observe the game. Sometimes the list includes Manchester Utd, Real Madrid, Barcelona and all of the big ones out there. And the reason they do it is because if you want to remain relevant, competitive and want to be the best club with the best team, not ony you want to study strategies and plays of others (that are not even in your chanpionship), but if you see something they have that would make your team better you will try to get it (eg: buy their players). 
All this analogy is to make the point that what's happening with BTC/BCH, in terms of decisions that were made, market response, rivalries, etc happens in every arena where there's competition. I happen to have a stance more like a TV commentator (that doesn't blast one side over the other), but can comment on which team is better using common sense and facts. BTC will always be  but don't try to shut down others.  
It's not a competition to see who knows more about bitcoin. I've been around since 2013 and I have a good general understanding of the technology and the economy of bitcoin. It's my opinion on Free market of ideas that you oppose (not my knowledge). Look, if cash had appeared in 2013, I would tear it to shreds. But in 2017, I'm more like: Meh, There are some issues with BTC, lets see where this goes and learn from it. 
Face it, if BitcoinCash was worth 2$ we wouldn't be having this conversation. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:20:29
Any player in the service industry will say they are better than the competing product. Directly or indirectly. If cash's shtick is to say they are the real one then so be it. Again, new comers are not 5. Like Pepsi and coke. Which one is "the real" coke? How many products use the "The original" slogan and claim they are "The original", "the authentic", etc when technically there can only be one valid claim of being the original and the authentic? 
As I said, it's more a pride and honor thing. I've been around a long time. I felt it too. I'm passed beyond it now and looking more into what the future looks like.

@_date: 2017-11-20 16:20:54
I get this politically. but it doesn't quite apply to the service industry. 
If you have one phone manufacturer in the world, it may become shit, because it doesn't have the incentive to be better. it's the only one. 
If you have Apple and Samsung batteling to have a better product for 10 years, we the consumer have a better product.

Pretty clear you are advocating against using exchanges, giving your main points against: 
- trading will bite you in the ass
- there is always a risk the people controlling your bitcoin
- Gox should have been a lesson to us all
I'm not saying you are not entitled to this position. 
All I'm asking is, what is the alternative? How do you have a better medium to measure supply/demand (which ultimately and organically sets the value of the coin)?
I get your point. That was clear. We should realize the risks of what we are doing before we do it. But SOMEONE has to do it. We cannot depend on in-person transactions and then word of mouth to broadcast your sell/purchase (which is technically the only alternative to exchanges). Or go back to [this]( Exchanges (verb) need to happen. Many thousands a minute. World wide. 
So my question is, again, what is the takeaway? 
- trading will bite you in the ass. Ok, fair advice **if** what you're saying is, be ready, know your risks, although it sounds a bit like a doomsday statement. It will bite some people in the ass, yes. We are all adults. McDonalds will ruin your health...yes if you eat 10 burgers a day. But I wouldn't generalize that everyone that is a customer will die because of it. At the end of the day it will bite irresponsible people in the ass...and in that particular example there's alternatives to McDonalds! Not with exchanges though.
- there is always a risk the people controlling your bitcoin (any idea on how to avoid this? Any idea of an alternative system that works better?). Even in regular fiat exchanges this needs to happen.
- Gox should have been a lesson to us all (What is the lesson? How to act on that lesson?).
You could leave the exchanges to the "financial experts" and financial institutions alone... but yeah...why in the hell would you want to do that now that we finally have the once Utopian free market exhange, by the people, for the people?
 Would that be a decentralized/organic market? It would be more of the same. You should **celebrate** exchanges. They are the motor of the crypto world. Without them there's no value consensus. 
I guess this was an overly-elaborated way to say: - U full of shit m8.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:27:38
Point taken. Time will tell. But in the process, everyone is getting better. I think people don't appreciate how valuable is the process, the now. Wars are fought throughout history. It's not new. It's expected even. America was stronger after WWII. It shouldn't be proud, but it did. Looking back we can recognize that. 
All I'm advocating is that we should fight, yes, but understand that "war" and competition might be what we needed to get moving.

There's BitcoinPlus and BitcoinDark and nobody is talking about those names. Why not admit that it's not about the name alone to start the debate. It is a mix of pride with honor, which is noble. Look, Gates and Jobs had their feuds, one stole from the other, one deceived the other, but then they went on their merry way and competed for users. We are at the time of conflict. 10 year later Jobs could have still moan about this and that but to what end? You just go ahead and offer the best product you possibly can and then the consumer decides. We live in the era of the internet. Don't treat new comers like 5 year olds. It's the same product with a few tweaks. Bytes are bytes. Ones and zeros. They (cash) went bold. Lets see if it pays off. If they fail Bitcoin community knows they were right. If they suceed, hats off. Either way Bitcoin thrives. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:14:13
I think we should look at Bitcoin Cash also as a potential safety net for when the Bitcoin network has a huge backlog or high fees (for whatever reason). If you have trust in Bitcoin (has I know you have) you should place it in a higher pedestal and assume it will always be  I don't see the threat of take over. I see it potentially as a service that can support Bitcoin in hard times and can allow crysis to be more manageable, sort of as emergency stairs are used in office fire drills.
The next day, everyone is back using elevators.  
But it's nice knowing the stairs are there.

I meant your banter. I don't engage in banter or attack you personally. Not my style. It's just a waste of energy.


So did Steve Jobs, so did Bill Gates, so did Mark Zuckerberg, so did... Point?


Wait, they have the ability to suceed at that in your eyes? I thought they were total losers.


It does. I fucking love Bitcoin. 


Nop. It's not a contest. Maybe for  spot, we could argue. Not for  But we can learn a lot from their attempts. 
Let me give you an example. Lets say they steal this information and they clone and implement lightning before BTC does. They fail miserably. Wouldn't you be happy to have that tested before in their network? Wouldn't that help to improve our own implementation of lightning? You see the bad and I'm with you on that bad (just not so passionately). But you don't see the benefits that can come from having a mini-version of basically the same product, just managed poorly. Even at managment you can learn from bad examples. As to what you not want. 


Maybe you'll find me at r/btc, but there I will be talking about Bitcoin. 
if BitcoinCash was failing you wouldn't oppose it. You're worried. But you shouldn't.

Lets say we considered it just a part of the portfolio (instead of a fixed % of the entire bankroll), the risk is already assessed. With some trial and error (or research) we end up using exclusively ExchangeA and B (less surprise with timings). Wouldn't this optimize the process?
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:39:33
I agree. What I think they could be doing (and this would make sense while being as shady as it looks to be) is offer a ridiculous low price for pre-order, use the pre-order money do buy the hardware, use the hardware for their own gain until the GH vs. difficulty is no longer that attractive, by then the user is stuck to a non-profitable/break even product for 12 months and the GH is always one step behind difficulty, praying for btc to sky rocket to new heights to make a profit.

Even if it takes 3 weeks. If it costs me USD824 and I sell for USD875. Is it really just the time thing?

Good one.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:03:25
Maybe it's me, sorry. I am honestly not getting it. I buy for USD824 and sell USD875. Even if it takes 1 month I'm still getting the USD875 (that value is locked regardless of BTC oscilation). 
I'm still getting the USD50 profit (one month later,yes) right?
edit: Ah, So they wait one week and then withdraw at the usd/btc rate of that time? If so that's almost criminal lol. I own BTC but never withdrew any.

Believe in BTC and hold or sell and get over with it.
If you want to trade try the BTC/LTC market. It's at 0.03131BTC per LTC and its was sitting at around 0.036 before yesterday's crash. This way you don't get stuck with fiat if BTC rises without looking back and you still make small profit. Well, that's what I just did with my btc, not saying I am a guru or advising, just sharing my current plan.

@_date: 2013-12-07 11:13:30
I understand the model of the 12 months is a trap, but 1000GH today would be attractive right? You would get your return easily in the 1st month (plus the possible return for real BTC believer who think 1000$ per btc is just the very beggining). The pre-order thing is as shady as a corner hooker scratching her arms. 
Edit: 1000$ per btc is a figure of speech, I am aware of the current price.
