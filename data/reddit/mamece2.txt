Hello, after several index attempts I think Its going to be synced.
I had problem with the blk00252.dat
After booting with a lubuntu live session i did a fschk to the partition. Fschk found no errors. I came back to ubuntu and started the node again.. Ive passes the blk00252 and still 0.94 in progress. I think the node is going to make it!
