No, you can only buy Yellow Snow when you take at least four scoops, here is a 25% off coupon on your next purchase! Oh by the way, when you put our yellow snow in your freezer it'll kick out the other ice!

My problem with windows exactly, you need to download IDEs and requirements from questionable websites. Spin up a VM to run docker images etc.
In the end it's only my personal opinion anyway
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:02:26
It's either that or a painting of a thunderstorm in the Netherlands

It's not that it's impossible to code under windows. Just that it sucks compared to *nix. Lack of package management, lack of proper command line power tools, everything needs a shitty slow GUI, etc. It just sucks ass
EDIT: windows 10 even includes an Ubuntu VM which just confirms the issues in the first place

If I remember correct they use both, but homemade bullets were less reliable and generally worse and thus less valuable
EDIT: I keep reading everywhere that at least in the game the only bullets you can use as currency are the prewar bullets. Though I think to remember that in the book they used both, though the homemade bullets are less valuable - which makes sense from a 'real-world' perspective but not from a game mechanics perspective.
Likely in the real world traders would accept any kind of bullet if they really needed to. But if they have the option to be picky they will be because homemade bullets are unreliable.

IMHO linux &gt; osx &gt; windows for development. Windows absolutely sucks ass for dev work, for OSX it's mostly their crappy desktop environment and locked platforms that annoys me, they are very anti user. I've worked plenty on all platforms to know

In Metro 2033 (book and game) they had bullets as currency. Which made a lot of sense as well since you absolutely needed them to survive and are difficult to make
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:22:29
Not if you factor in the cost of the panels

No you're right. But it's not deciding who can mine in that sense. Everyone can mine. Though there have to be certified blocks every so often. It's basically two separate systems: identification and certification. We have chosen to implement them in a certain way but you can use the basic structure to create more objective methods. End users can opt to certify miners locally, or disable the system entirely. It's not built in in that sense
There are more usecases for cryptocurrency than a purely 'free' system. Look at the mining distribution of bitcoin and the problems this potentially creates. A government type entity needs to address these problems. They're social problems not technical

For the EFL project we've developed a certified miners system to reduce attacks and the impact of multi pools. Every sixth block must be mined by a certified miner. To become a certified miner you're required to sign the block with the coinbase address, so the miner can identify themselves. The EFL foundation can then choose to certify this miner using a special transaction. All information is stored in the blockchain. Obviously this introduces a central party with a certain amount of control. We're thinking about automatically (de)certifying miners based on historic behavior though we haven't really come around to developing a solution like this

We can hardly fathom the scale of the universe or how many atoms there are in our hand, let alone imagine how many atoms are in the entire universe which can only be an educated guess with orders of magnitude room for errors in the first place.
I think it's a fine comparison. Just not when you look at it mathematically

Repeat questions and statements in your own words. It'll allow you to check whether you understood it right, think a little more about it and even point out flaws in a question or statement if there are any hidden.

That's why you'd want to delegate it to a company like gitlab. But probably a single large server could handle the bitcoin git traffic just fine.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:12:50
In that way yes. A lot of small FOSS wouldn't have been found or even existed without GitHub. Though I think this is less of an issue for bitcoin in its current state. To come up with a system that enables GitHub like functionality in a purely decentralized way would be hard though. The blockchain would become massive unless it's sharded. You also don't want people to have to pay to push a line of code, open an issue etc. It's possible, but hard. I found

Github is just basically a front to the open source git software (Linux foundation) which is decentralized by itself. Anyone can set up a git server, anyone who has a clone of the repository is essentially a git server. Github doesn't have anything absolutely essential for anything, it's just the default place for open source and they have some nice workflow additions (issue tracker, merge requests etc).
If github gets messed up you can simply move to gitlab, bitbucket or the Bitcoin Foundation could just set up its own server
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:32:15
ofcourse, git is just one of the tools github uses, so to speak. Git is just the core.

I never said they would choose fiat over btc, and I'm not saying btc couldn't be used for interplanetary transactions
Lightning could perhaps be used locally for daily shopping I'll give you that

If I were the boss on Mars, and there would be sufficient resources, I'd opt to create a MarsCoin based off BTC. That could seamlessly integrate into BTC
There would not be much reason to keep using BTC. I'd want to have a degree of control over the mining power (in the sense that it must be local) and not be dependent on earth for security and transaction maturity.
You don't want to freeze your economy because some nutjob dictator decided to press the red button. Obviously this all depends on political stability on earth and perhaps further improvements on BTC itself that would allow say independent side chains (which I think is already possible but it must also work without the mother chain)
EDIT then again money may not even really be a thing for a long long time on Mars. The colony might not even want to have a thing like money eventually
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:22:32
At some point they'd certainly have a use for money. I think the question is whether they'd want to or, or whether it'll occur naturally after a period of bartering. At first there's no point to have money
@_date: 2019-02-22 17:17:41
On mars you got a 20+ minute light speed delay so if you want to be connected to a blockchain on earth it wouldn't be very practicle. I don't think it would even be possible to run a miner on Mars due to this delay (ignoring energy constraints) so no I don't think Mars would opt to use bitcoin
The technology certainly supports it to some degree but if mars wants to have an independent economy I don't think they'd use bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:20:12
But it aligns with my opinion so it's true!

Short term thinking. Borrowing from the future. In Dutch we call it 'roofbouw' (loosely translates to overexploitation) referring to how farmers can wreck their soil by extracting as much as possible too fast

I don't think they will

What I mean is if you go on the darknet and go "Attention drugdealers, hitmans and hackers! I have some amazing toasters for you!" it's hard to argue you didn't know
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:03:23
Yeah you can just copy them all no problem, optionally delete wallet.dat
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:12:49
Well you could argue that you knowingly accepted dirty money, depending on the laws in your country that may be punishable

Well my bank won't process transactions during the holidays so there's that. Pin transactions still work they just take more time to settle
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:43:01
I'd just copy everything except coin.conf and wallet.dat. There are also a bunch of index files that are needed to be able to read the blocks. Otherwise the pi will have to reindex which takes just as long
