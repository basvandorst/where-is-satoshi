Sure.  Asteroid mining is why I suspect precious metals will be relatively worthless in 30 years.
Some questions:  How much wealth is gotten by the money printers each time they initially print and sell a dollar?  At what cost to the printers?  At what risk?  How many times can a single printer do this?  At what point in history does this happen?
You'll find the story is very different with gold miners.

"The Man" (the banks) isn't stealing money.  They're selling money.
In exchange for what?
If you add up all the dollars in Federal Reserve notes and in people's bank accounts, you at least hundreds of trillions of dollars, but no one knows for sure how many.  What did people sell to get all that money?

The moment there's n clones of Bitcoin's accounts, and everyone has to switch to these because Bitcoin is being beaten by a technologically better cryptocurrency, is the moment that Bitcoin loses.  Its price drops to a factor of 1/n.  Its supply rises by a factor of n.  and it's officially beaten by that technologically better cryptocurrency because everyone doesn't know which of the n currencies they're supposed to be using.
What do you do then?  Use all n at once?
If you're using n different currencies because no one can decide which one they're supposed to switch to, you might as well just start using the currency that was beating Bitcoin in the first place!  You're already using multiple currencies!

Bitcoin will eventually fail.  At 10 minutes/transaction confirmation, it's way too slow.  The GHOST algorithm lets us have the same security at 20 seconds/block.  So it'll be replaced by a better cryptocurrency.  And every new app-coin is evidence that people want a more powerful protocol.

In the early 1930s, the average citizen lost his ability to exchange dollars for gold.  In 1971, the banks lost this ability as well.
Honestly though, gold backing was a terrible idea.  Who thought that they wouldn't print more IOUs than they promised to?  Who thought that they wouldn't stop honoring the IOUs entirely once they'd gotten everyone's gold and people had switched to fiat?  The whole thing was a scam from the start.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:33:57
Considering that Counterparty is essentially an altcoin, and to use its smart contracts, you need to use both Bitcoin and XCP, Counterparty is not a solution anyway.

I went to a talk given by the professor who lead this research.  He said that they just tested different sized starting populations of "unshakable individuals".  In the model, new converts are never unshakable, which makes the model unrealistic.
Their conclusion was that if you start with an unshakable population of at least 10% and the other people are always swayable, the majority is always eventually converted.  If less than 10% of the starting population is unshakable, and the rest of the people are swayable though, then the opinion never becomes a majority opinion.

The dollar is created when the central bank prints a dollar and sells it to someone.  The dollar represents the amount that the central bank bought from people in return for dollars.  Technically, it's supposed to be a loan, but they haven't paid on it for 80 years.  So the dollar is backed by the collateral people have lost to the banks.
Bitcoin was created when someone wanted to build a freer, more equal tomorrow.  The units of currency represent the percentage of the entire future Bitcoin economy, which people hope will be larger and wealthier.  They were largely awarded to people who quickly adopted and secured the protocol.  So Bitcoin is backed by dreams of percentage stake in a society.

@_date: 2014-12-19 00:43:12
The "Why" of Bitcoin is that (whatever currency your country uses), the banks create money for -free- and they buy stuff with it.  Since the banks get money for free, the money system our countries use funnels real property into the banks, at no cost or risk to the banks.  This creates a whole lot of inequality.  Bitcoin was created so we'd have a form of money without someone having infinite money.
Also, the theory is that without a constantly increasing supply, the value of Bitcoin should tend to increase, not decrease.
Aside from that, Bitcoin is fairly competitive with your country's currency's technology.  You can use Bitcoin online, and (unlike your country's currency), you can send it to anyone at a low fee without restriction.
The only problems, IMO, that Bitcoin has technologically is that:
- Secure transactions take at least 5 minutes, so it really shouldn't be used in a store. (a few newer coins can achieve the same security in 5 seconds because of an algorithm [GHOST] invented by some Israeli scientists, but there's been no talk of implementing this in Bitcoin yet).
- Transactions cost about $0.05, so you can't buy anything smaller than a pack of gum or so.  There has been some research into algorithms (PoS) that could lower this, but no one, as far as I know, has found a solution proven to work.
- Not anonymous.  People often say Bitcoin is anonymous, but actually, it can be traced.  There are many attempts out there to make a more anonymous coin.

No.  Money isn't free.  It isn't created out of "thin air".
To put a dollar into circulation, the bank needs to find someone to make a loan to.  The number amount represents how much real (non currency) wealth is owned by the banks.  In other words:  The banks own more real wealth than all currency put together.  That is what fiat is backed by -- the fact that we've given everything to the banks.
For someone to bother starting a cryptocurrency, they need to think that they can sell it to a community who will trade with it.  The number represents how much of this society a person could potentially own if they switched entirely to the cryptocurrency.  Cryptocurrencies are backed by the potential wealth of a, hopefully, growing economy.
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:38:03

The central banks make the money for free -- as much as they want for the moment.  And they sell it for property.  It then circulates throughout the rest of the people.

And by "worse features", I mean that it's slower than Ethereum (Ethereum secures 50x faster than BTC), and it costs a higher transaction fee to use than Bitcoin.
Yes, Ethereum contracts are executable in Counterparty and vise-versa.  That's why I say that Counterparty is a bad port of Ethereum: It has all the features of Ethereum, but it has the extra limitations of running on the Bitcoin blockchain.

According to the CPI (~2% inflation per year), it's closer to $13.
However, the CPI uses an ever shifting basket of goods to compare the value of the dollar to (People buy less expensive goods when the purchasing power changes, and different goods become fashionable.  The CPI index tries to measure what people actually buy).  If we keep the basket of goods from 2002, however, it's probably closer to $20, but there's no official organization that tracks the prices of a constant basket of goods.

Technically, the make money by buying property or loans in exchange for the money.
So it's actually better than free for the banks.  It's theft.

And again, if the solution "just move everyone's accounts over to a clone of the new currency" actually worked, then Bitcoin is doomed to failure because banks would just move everyone's fiat accounts over to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-12-26 04:40:45
And how will Bitcoin decide which innovation to add other than by being beaten by another currency?
Seriously, your solution to "Bitcoin may be beaten by a technologically better currency" is "We'll clone that other currency and move to a 3rd currency"????
And how will you decide which of the many clones to use?

You would need to change the protocol to implement smart-contracts straight in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin's protocol hasn't changed much since its release, and smart-contracts would be a huge change.
On the other hand, a few alt-coins already do implement this.

A finite gold supply sustains itself.  Gold is mined once and sold once.  By many miners who have done a shitton of work to get that people.
Fiat, on the other hand, is continuously printed.  Always by the same people.
Fiat is unlimited.  Printed for free. Sold for real value.
Gold is relatively finite.  Costs a great deal to mine.  Then it is sold.

Very interesting.  I've been worried about this myself considering how large the site has gotten.  Can you comment more on this?
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:06:42
Counterparty uses Bitcoin's blockchain, but it's an altcoin.  You can't write any smart contracts that interact with Bitcoin.

You're kidding right?
The central banks:  The owners of the currencies.  The creators of the money.
They have infinite money, and they get it for free.
@_date: 2015-05-01 06:25:59
No, it really isn't possible.  You'd need smart-contracts that can sell bitcoin based on future events (such as prices).
That's not possible because smart contracts (such as Counterparty's) cannot be loaded with Bitcoin.

The intent of your original statement was clear, but it's badly worded.
If you have a $10 bill from 2002, it's still worth $10 today.  But in that time, its purchasing power has declined by a factor of ~12.
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:59:09
90%?  Psh.
So what?  People don't usually start rioting until 95% of their after-bill-and-tax income is going toward food.

I can't answer that.  But consider that Bitcoin's protocol has never updated except to fix bugs and implement features that were planned from the very start.  They haven't even implemented the GHOST algorithm which would speed up Bitcoin's security by 50x and make it viable to use in a store.  They've been talking about implementing sidechains for about a year now, and that still hasn't happened.
IMO, Bitcoin's Dev team is a mess.
BTW, we do have to worry about people forking Ethereum
and eventually, we all have to move to Quantum Computer resistant currency, or our money will become worthless in several years.

Cryptocurrencies are a gimmick in this game.  You could do it with dollars.
@_date: 2014-12-26 02:46:40
You're counting on something extremely unlikely.
1. A cryptocurrency creator would only lose money by doing this. They have no reason to invest their time into this development.
2. Anyone who made a purchase of Bitcoin in the time after the release of "Bitcoin Redux" would lose and have no reason to switch.  In fact, if Bitcoin Redux were released, I'd sell all my Bitcoin for Ethereum because there would be 0 risk that I'd lose my position in Bitcoin Redux.
3. Anyone who'd just sell their Bitcoin and buy Ethereum would be securing their money just as easily.
But by all means, bet all your money on this unlikely and nonsensical occurrence.  I can't stop you.

Pressuring?  He said he wanted to buy them.
It's just not wise to think that you'll be able to buy them at the current price "over the next few years".
When it was at $10, I thought "I'll buy some now, and I'll buy some slowly over the next few years."  Then the price was at $100 before I got around to buying any more, and I said "Fuck.  Well, I'm done.  I don't have enough money to make it worth it anymore."

Whoever told you that clearly doesn't know that 2015 is the year Ethereum is being released...
@_date: 2014-12-26 03:18:55
Right.  Some currency will implement it. Probably soon.
But it'll require a fork of the blockchain for Bitcoin or Ethereum to implement it.
I have no faith that the Bitcoin Dev Team will get its shit together and do that.  Ethereum's dev team might.

Yup.  February or March

The only thing I don't like about Bitcoin is that there's absolutely no way to make a trustless futures market with Bitcoin backed contracts.
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:47:42
I bought a bunch a few years ago.  That was a good time.  Back then, I recommended Bitcoin to my friends.
Now, I recommend Ethereum, which has many technical advantages.

This could be done with dollars and PayPal.  Nothing special.

People have been philosophizing about cryptocurrency since the early 90s.  Long before Bitcoin was released, some of us (myself included), expected this to happen and foresaw its rise.
@_date: 2015-05-01 06:35:27
However, I don't think that the lack of Bitcoin-backed futures contracts is something that most people will care about for a while.
@_date: 2015-04-12 00:54:52
Because Bitcoin has no interest rate being set by banks, it is very unwise to create or accept a loan in Bitcoin.  Neither party has any guarantee about what the price of Bitcoin will be at the maturity of the loan.
Since you're working with an economist, I suggest researching on how, despite the fact that Bitcoin has no estimated future value, people can still do financial planning with it.  (My suggestion:  Vouchers that track the price of goods, similar to BITUSD, and futures markets priced in Bitcoin are necessary before you can have any confidence about the future price of goods).

No it isn't always good to theorize.  That's how people go insane.

@_date: 2015-03-26 16:26:38
It seems you were right.
On closer examination, I've found that Vitalik is actually quite insane.  He sincerely believes his high-minded ideas are airtight and does not listen to criticism and counter examples that people point out. He does not understand that there are contradictions to all of mathematics because math is invented by describing evidence as it is found, and reality does not actually follow mathematical laws.
Additionally, the idea of a VM on a blockchain is not actually that original.  Nick Szabo had the basic idea before him.
Perhaps Ethereum will eventually be released.  But perhaps Vitalik is simply too in love with his ideas instead of evidence to make it work.
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:32:31
Fair enough.  Do you want me to send you a dollar or so?  If so, let me know your bitcoin address (sorry, I don't feel like using changetip.   I don't have an account, so it would take a while)
It took me a lot of thinking and experiencing, but I've realized that words alone cannot prove anything, and evidence is always needed.  Also, software pretty much always has bugs.  There is no such thing as perfect practical security aside from what hasn't been broken yet.
However, I do believe that Ethereum's dreams are achievable.  Absolutely anything is achievable because reality doesn't actually follow mathematical laws -- instead, mathematics is fit to the evidence that we find.  They just might not be able to do it.
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:23:45
I'd say it's a combination of all of those.  Except I don't think people understand fiat enough for there to be any cognitive dissonance.
But also, if a store decided it was only dealing in some other currency and didn't accept your nation's fiat, it would in fact by shut down by the police.  A store can accept whatever currency it wants, but it's illegal in your country not to accept the fiat.
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:14:44
You got it!
Next piece of the puzzle:  What is fiat backed by?
I promise it *is* backed by something.  It's just nicer to think it's backed by nothing.
