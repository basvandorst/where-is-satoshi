Science fiction with an extremely high possibility of being reality within a few years. 
As soon as traditional currencies move to the blockchain, as Russia and many others already plan to do, its potato:potatoe. 
Swaps between blockchains will become an insignificant everyday occurance.

What makes you think you'll ever need to swap your cryptocoins for fiat? Just go spend them directly with merchants. 
If your merchant doesn't accept cryptocoin, find another merchant

Assuming the market to spend crypto for everyday items doesn't soon follow, making fiat obsolete ;)

"Might get replaced by an altcoin" that's NOT what you should be worrying about. Government regulation and taxation is the real danger, any coin resistant to that will thrive

Then hold $30 bucks. If you had done that in 2011 you'd be a millionaire by now. That, or get a job

This really isn't conclusive evidence of theft. Merely bad practice generating the key on the server. I would do a bit more research before accusing someone on such accusations
