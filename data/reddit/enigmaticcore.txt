The nature of their legal claims calls for a precedent. The technicalities surrounding those, should raise a huge red flag.

This is the biggest issue. I'm amazed there hasn't been a lot more publicity. Some of his support was taken away because of the murder accusations, however, I think there is probably more to it than that. Wither he is guilty, or innocent, this case needs more publicity. The more analysis this case can get, the better. Or else, we simply have the government deciding without a decent check and balance system. Whatever their opinion, people need to be educated in that opinion. Each individual can do their part to increase publicity.

The person who ran SR didn't spend much of this 'cut' for being so centered money. Even if they did, how many were saved from street violence from the same process?
In any case, what about the process of justice? Is it not important for anyone, guilty or innocent, to have due process? There are multiple issues involved. It's not just "does this man deserve to be in jail". If law were about personal opinion, we might as well live in a dictatorship.

It's 'retarded' to ignore all the other issues involved and make an argument of "just don't do that". That adds nothing to the discussion.

Why 'click away' before you have your answers? The problem with this case, and many, many other things... is that people don't take the time to educated themselves, yet still form their opinions and act and accuse based on them.

A lot more useful things were said after about minute 9. Things move from motherly support more and more after that. I wish there were a more succinct outline available for those without the attention span to not dismiss things after the first 5 minutes.
