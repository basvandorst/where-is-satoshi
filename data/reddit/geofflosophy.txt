The fact that he didn't create the math behind bitcoin is more to my point, but fair enough.

Satoshi didn't make the sexbot, he just made an AI platform. Specifically the self-awareness part. There are many other robots at the time that act like robots. He fuses the technologies with this new AI code of his to form the first independently intelligent machine.

Well no one knows what he is. He's a great assimilator of disparate information, but maybe he's just a thief with a time machine? I do wonder why he would create AI if it might threaten humanity, maybe that link needs to be expanded upon.

That's easy enough to change.

Lol that chart tho...

You're dumb, a bigger block size is by definition out of consensus.

I agree with OP, though I don't think R3 is really trying to kill Bitcoin by forcing Hearn out. I think they are just trying to lower the price enough to buy in themselves before the next big surge.

I agree with OP and Monkeybars, we haven't started yet. We have to bust through all time highs before we start mooning.

Lol dude we're drawing attention to the hypocrisy of their message, and using something that is 100% neutral and spoonfeeding them their racist narrative. Anyone who runs with the "white male money" narrative has no clue and hasn't done their homework.

Not on message, private property. They had at least 10 police and 6 squad cars.

To answer your question, they are screaming about congestion because the confirmation time is high. Bitpay accepts zero confirmation transactions, but when you send money to bitpay you are cashing out that money. For two people to transact peer to peer without middlemen they need to wait for transaction confirmations.

Also they would still need your pin and passphrase, which ideally you would store in an alternative location.

Bitcoin will unite us. Trump wants to tax remittance 35%, but Bitcoin has no walls.
We got a nice "Bit-Coin" chant going. They pulled me away but I did my best to get the message across.

It's unstable because it is small market cap. Realistically it is going to need to be in the 6 digit range before we can expect any kind of stability like what you seek.

They are a legit company, the owner is on video here: 
Whether they will get positive ROI or not is debatable, but my bet is yes, which is why I bought contracts. The 30% revenue reinvestment is a big factor for me, they can do this at scale to maintain my hashing power in a way that individual miners and group buys cannot.

I own contracts on Cloudhashing, and have very thoroughly vetted them to make sure 1) they're legit and 2) they have the promised hashing power sourced. Their Platinum contract is actually cheaper than 2 two-year 10 GH contracts from Bitcoin Frenzy, though they are claming 25-55 BTC in the first year, with that upper estimate being the same as the claim by Bitcoin Frenzy.
These guys have no credibility established anywhere, and they don't have any information on when the contracts are starting or where they are getting their hashing power. I would be very weary buying, at the very least contact them first and find out the answers to those questions.

I have a 50 BTC limit in coinbase, so I could purchase 100 BTC in two days.

I think that NYC is the place to be. The population is huge, and the city is truly international. Neighborhoods are hyperlocalized, so you can offer value to 10s of thousands of people by just having 20 or so stores accepting bitcoin in a 5 block radius. The finance connection is also huge.

These miners will not be profitable. There is 1000 TH+++ entering the market by the end of September alone between KnC and Avalon preorders. They need to charge much less.
