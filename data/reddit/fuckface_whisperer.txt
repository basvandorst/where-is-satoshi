Like Enron?  Or Lehman Brothers? Or WorldCom? 
You're not really using a solid argument here.

I stop by now and again to read the delusion.

Governments accept tax from anything that made anyone money.  Bernie Madoff and The mafia included.

I sold my Bitcoin long long ago, and no I don't believe in it.
If you think something so volatile is a good currency, you're the idiot.

I'm good.  Thanks for your concern though fellow human.

Are you saying there will never actually be a peak and it will grow forever? 1mm, 5mm, 100mm, 1bil, etc?

That doesn't entirely make sense.
I assume you mean that Bitcoin will be ready when it's adoption and use is widespread right?  So you'd have an ever increasing population using Bitcoin, which by definition would pump the demand and since supply is capped, the value would keep increasing.
Which is a problem in and of itself.   Why would you ever spend something today that's worth more tomorrow?
