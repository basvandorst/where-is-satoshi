Cryptos need very high risk appetite and low interest rates to moon like last year. I'm not sure a stock market crash is good for cryptos at all.  IMO if the S&amp;P 500 hit 3500 this year, BTC might reach 30k.

Looks like China caught on to this scam.  They are creating crude oil futures denominated in yuan, and they reportedly are demanding the Saudis accept yuan for barrels of oil they buy.

The assets are different, times are different, but investor psychology stays pretty much the same.  Markets are driven by greed and fear, very powerful emotions which approaches extreme levels at times.
Here's a bubble stock from personal experience:
Thankfully a trailing stop forced me to sell too early back then.  This is the kind of crash one never forgets.  I hope something like this doesn't happen to BTC, but it's a possibility to keep in mind.

Key levels
Support: 8250, 8000, 7750
Resistance: 9090, 9350, 9500
Going above 9.5k and sustaining the level for more than a day or two would mean a significant trend reversal. 
Falling below 7750 would break the counter-trend rally since Tuesday, followed by possibly a re-test of the 5.9k low.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:02:57
Absolutely - lots of liquidity in the system is a must.  Since cryptos yield 0%, a continued low interest rate environment is required too.
This is the scariest CPI release in 10 yrs. We'll see what happens, but IMO we don't go from having inflation that are consistently too low, to suddenly very high inflation over 2 weeks.  The markets are spooked by inflation fears, that's for sure.

Bitcoin has always been risky AF.  Risk is a function of volatility. BTC volatility is almost 10 times that of the S&amp;P 500, and stocks aren't the safest investments to begin with.

Not necessarily. BTC once dropped 94% in a bear mkt and came back stronger.
A lot of cryptos will get wiped out though, fraudulent schemes will be exposed all over, just like how a lot of garbage dot com companies went bankrupt in 2001-03.

The volume for bitcoin futures have been putrid, accounting for just a tiny fraction of equity futures (e.g. S&amp;P 500 e-mini, NASDAQ 100) and commodity futures (oil, gold) volume.  Most institutional investors have no crypto exposure.  It would actually be very bullish for cryptos if institutions start buying a tiny bit as "alternative assets".  The potential for inflows are huge.
The best use of bitcoin futures have been for the whales to hedge their large BTC holdings via shorting.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:49:04
Oh I know exactly what happened, I held through that bear market.  It was relatively easy because I only had less than 1% of assets in BTC.  At some points it felt like it was definitely heading down to zero.  When you can feel despair from just checking the price a couple of times a week, THAT was what a bear market bottom felt like.
A long term investor buys when there's blood in the streets.  The sentiment now is anything but despair and hopeless.  On a mere 6% pop there are all these beginners FOMOing and cheering non-stop and ready to declare victory.  From experience this means we're nowhere near a bottom.
Long term I remain bullish on the technology, just not bullish at all on this grossly inflated price.  IMO bitcoin will survive and thrive again and probably make news ATHs eventually, even if it falls to $600 again. 
There are no financial instruments that are buys at any price.  When valuation is sky high it means the market has run far ahead of fundamentals and priced in a perfect scenario.  Reality rarely turns out perfect.  This principle applies to stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate too, not just cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:59:00
Long-term bonds are in trouble.  Short-term US Treasuries are still the safest and most liquid investments in the world.  That's where institutional investors have been hiding during this market selloff.

This is very similar to mid-2000 for dot com stocks.  Their share prices were chopped in half from ATHs reached around March 2000.  Money on the sideline who missed the exponential gains in the prior year came in to buy the dip.  Sentiment was actually pretty positive: hey, the internet is still the future!  There were no memes back then but plenty of talk about lambos.
Then the next wave of the bear market hit and these stocks went down another 85-99%. Most bottomed around 1 to 1.5 years later. At their ultimate bear market bottoms, stock message boards were eerily quiet and sentiment was extremely negative.  Most investors have given up and there were virtually no one saying buy the dip. 
Here's the leader of the dot com stocks at the time, Yahoo.  Keep in mind it did better than most of its peers:

I don't think there's a better choice with cryptos

Cryptos yield 0% and there are no reliable, third party data on commercial usage

In an unregulated market like cryptos, there may be a lot of wash trading to create illusion of volume. Some of these patterns look highly manipulated

That was my point - FX is a zero sum game, but not because of future contracts, because most of the transactions are spot buys/sells.  When taking into account a basket of foreign currencies, USD vs its many fiat pairs as a whole, is broadly a zero sum game.

Lower volatility is a good thing for the bulls. If insane volatility continues it'll turn off all but the most hardcore gamblers.
Lower volume on the bounce is a problem though. Volume has tapered off since 7.2k and consistently decreased.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:33:32
The fundamentals of cryptos aren't really quantifiable at this point, which makes their valuation exceptionally ambiguous. 
This is the reason why cryptos can go to the moon, or crash worse than any other asset.  BTC can be worth $100 or 100k depending on who you ask.  It's a sentiment driven market.

It depends on your age - if you're young, a high risk portfolio like this can be rewarding, and you'll have years to wait for huge gains without needing to withdraw money for retirement.
You can consider adding some international stock exposure, via ETFs such as EEM or EFA. International stocks have trailed far behind US stocks in the past few years, and they tend to outperform in the late cycle with strong global growth.

Currently Wall St has a very small presence in the crypto space.  There are only a handful of cryptocurrency funds and BTC futures volume have been putrid.  I think Wall St will eventually adopt some cryptos as legitimate financial instruments but that process will take awhile.  When it happens, the inflows will drive a massive crypto bull market that dwarf the one we had in 2017, but it'll probably be a few years down the line

Cryptos are correlated to global risk appetite.  Here are a few of the most widely used measures of global risk appetite, I've provided the tickers for the ETFs tracking these assets:
1) S&amp;P 500
2) MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM)
3) MSCI EAFE Index (international developed market stocks, EFA)
4) Russell 2000 (US small caps, IWM)
5) US high yield bonds (HYG)
There are other measures too such as EM bonds and cyclical commodities, but the above would be a good start.

In order to be an effective currency, price stability vs a basket of major fiat currencies is critical.  This composite price can be high or low.

Leverage is way lower than other future contracts such as S&amp;P 500 e-mini, oil, gold etc  because of the very high volatility of bitcoin. The talk on the Street around the btc future launch was about the insanely high margin requirements.
Institutional investors have to be accountable to clients.  Imagine having to explain to clients why you loaded up the portfolio with penny stocks and then they lost most of their life savings.  It's career suicide.  Like it or not the stigma with cryptos is real and it'll take awhile for this asset class to get accepted as legitimate investments.  Regulations are required before most institutional investors will even consider cryptos as legitimate alternative assets.

Either it defends the 5873 double bottom successfully (an excellent scenario), or it fails there and heads to a likely 90-99% bottom. 
Judging from past post-bubble crashes, Amazon and Yahoo stocks dropped 95% during the dot com crash.  I can't justify BTC having better fundamentals than these two, and BTC went up much more than AMZN and YHOO on a percentage basis during the bubble phase.

True, but Microsoft and biotechs like Amgen and Biogen didn't have exponential rallies in 1999/early 2000.  Bitcoin absolutely went parabolic in 2017, so its comparison should be the dot coms and telecom equipment stocks, superstars like Yahoo, Amazon, CMGI, infospace, microstrategy, inktomi, i2, ariba, commerce one, freemarkets, qualcomm, Cisco, Nortel, Juniper, Ciena etc
IIRC none of these superstar stocks fell less than 90% in the ensuing bear market. 
CSCO fell from $82 to $8.  That's 90%.  It's 18 years later and now it's trading at $41.  I wouldn't call CSCO a company with poor fundamentals.

Percentage wise bitcoin went up a lot more than most dot com stocks during the tech bubble.
Comparing the market caps of cryptos vs Google is interesting as both technologies are transformative. When Google went public in 2004 it already had the largest market share in search engines, had only a 23 billion market cap, and many on the Street considered the IPO to be overpriced.  It took 19 years for Google/Alphabet to have 750 billion market cap. Bitcoin has only been around for 9 yrs, altcoins a lot shorter.
Google has far more users than the entire crypto space put together, even if you only count the search engine and youtube. Long term I'm bullish on blockchain technology, but cryptos having 2/3rd of Google's current market cap is frankly ridiculous and indicative of a massive bubble and prices running way ahead of fundamentals.
The sentiment here is very similar to Apr-Sep 2000.  It was Yahoo stock message boards back then.  Money on the sidelines who missed prior year's exponential bull run came in to buy "the dip".  FOMO was in the air and sentiment was pretty bullish.  The NASDAQ rebounded 40% during this period from the Mar 2000 crash.  Then the 2nd wave of the bear market hit and dot coms went down another 85-99%.
Short-term traders who bottom fished tech stocks and took profits quickly did fine, as long as they had the discipline to cut losses immediately when key support levels were broken in Oct 2000. Buy-and-hold bulls who believed in the long-term potential of the internet and bought half way down the Himalayas lost their shirts when the full mountain-shaped mean reversion completed.
For some perspective: a year ago BTC's price was $1050
What was the technological breakthrough that justifies a 10x rise in price?

Exceptionally ambiguous valuation is a key reason why it ran up that far.  Depending on who you ask, bitcoin can be worth $1 or 100k.  There are very few things in the world for which the disparity in the perception of value can be that large.

BTC was at 1k at the beginning of last year, it's still up 700% since then, wouldn't be surprised to see it revert to that starting point or even fall significantly below 1k, if only briefly
Huge parabolic trends have a knack for dropping insane amounts when momentum chasing hot money runs out, and it turns into a nasty bear market. Many of the hottest dot com companies back in year 2000 dropped 90%+. Some went bankrupt, others were bought by larger companies for pennies on the dollar.  Among the surviving companies, most are still down 50 to 90%+ from their Y2K highs.

If it breaks Tues low of 5873 and don't bounce back quickly, the ensuing capitulation will likely get very nasty, no levels are safe until the entire bull run in 2017 is reversed (sub 1k)

Why wouldn't there be sellers?  The whales are still up anywhere from 700% to 10000%+ and they have a ton of BTCs
Put yourself in their shoes, if you bought at $10, doesn't it make sense to sell at least a major chunk and lock in some huge gains?

You might want to be cautious if it involves drawing straight lines on a chart. It all depends on the scale used by the charting software.  Different scales would give very different levels.

On industry consolidation: I agree with you here. The key question is which coins will be the survivors and subsequent beneficiaries of lessened competition.  The new market leaders might not exist yet, just like how Google, FB and Netflix were not public companies during the dot com bubble.  What's your view?
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:59:35
Sure, zoom out: BTC price at the beginning of 2017 was 1k, at the beginning of 2016 it was $430

Singapore's government is working on a blockchain project to create a digital version of the Singapore dollar.
Here's what the Singaporean regulator said about crypto speculation:
"But the speculators and the people who are making money out of this speculation of the cryptocurrency (market) are perhaps negatively impacting the whole experimentation of cryptocurrency."
I find this to be pretty disturbing.
Your thoughts?
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:23:28
Yup, there's no guarantee BTC will survive and emerge as the crypto leader in the next bull market.  Its technology is the most proven and secure though.

Technicians call the 50d SMA crossing below the 200d the "death cross", and the reverse the "golden cross"
From experience this is an unreliable signal, because it merely signals a mature trend and is thus a lagging signal.

Exactly - too fast too quick. It happens with every bubble. Speculators see a get-rich-quick scheme and pile in.  Markets have an evil habit of shaking out all but the staunchest bulls.
For reference:
Amazon stock dropped 95% during the dot com crash.  Many of its competitors went bust, the industry consolidated and that allowed Amazon to become dominant in the e-commerce space.  
It took AMZN 9 years to get back to its 1999 ATH, but the stock is now much higher (11x), 18 yrs later.  The bulls who bought anywhere near the crash low of $5.5 totally raked it in (AMZN is $1339 now)

Undoubtedly it works well for a bull market pullback.  However, in a bear market an asset can melt down on low volume for days

Currencies are fundamentally used for commerce, not speculation.
Are there any reliable figures on the growth in commerce volume conducted using BTC, in the past 12 months since these technological improvements?

Most Wall St exposure in BTC right now are pro traders getting gambling fixes in during weekends.  There are a few crypto funds such as BK but total AUM is tiny.  On the other hand, institutional ownership represents huge potential for growth and IMO will be the key catalyst for the next bull market.
Having both a future position and a spot position in the underlying asset is a basic futures trading strategy.  Net exposure and delta are adjusted this way.  It doesn't mean there's price manipulation. 
Here's a comparison of ES and BTC trading volumes:
1.2 million vs 1.4k  
If you think some Wall St institutional investors are manipulating BTC spot prices to feed their small number of BTC future contracts, then only trade on weekends.

BTC should survive to see another bull market even if it ultimately crashes 95%+ from ATH, can't say that for most other cryptos though
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:24:20
BTC went from 1k to 19.8k last year. The most comparable recent examples of assets which went up that much that quickly, are internet stocks during the dot com bubble, and most of those stocks ended in total tragedies.

Governments will have much tighter control on digital fiats than on bank notes (paper bills).  They can track every purchase made by every citizen.  I think this is the opposite of what blockchain tech is meant to be.

Crypto investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars or more in exchange "hacks" - e.g. Mt Gox, Coincheck, South Korean exchanges etc. You haven't accounted for these huge losses.
Of course it matters whether it's a currency or commodity, the fundamentals and valuations are different.
With little quantifiable fundamentals and exceptionally ambiguous valuation, cryptos are a lot closer to online poker than an asset. Which is fine - some poker pros made millions in the online poker craze just a few years ago, so a casino game can be very profitable to some players, and there are skills which allow poker pros to have an edge vs other players. However, Hold'em is not an asset.

Cryptos are clearly a threat to the banks' oligopoly.  They can't control the crypto world but they can shut (most of) the path of conversion from fiat to cryptos and vice versa

Head &amp; shoulders is a long term pattern. The powerful reversals typically occur when the pattern took over 1 yr to develop.
Short term traders can use it for reference, but I'd caution against trading based exclusively on this. It's nowhere near as reliable if the pattern is just minutes, hours or a few days old. 
Algorithms(bots) can easily draw a short-term head &amp; shoulders pattern to lure traders into false reversals.  This happens with stocks all the time.

The odds are pretty poor tbh
Out of all the dot com and network equipment stocks in 1999/2000, only a few have made higher all-time highs, and it's 18 years later.
Amazon is the best case. eBay, Priceline and qualcomm are other examples.
Many dot coms went bankrupt, others were bought out by competitors for pennies on the dollar.  Sector leader Yahoo survived and had a decent bounce, but never got anywhere close to its Y2K ATH again.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:55:22
Great company, still own some of it now.
Yeah AMGN did more than double in 1999, but the dot coms were up  500 to 10000%+ within a year.  Biotechs weren't very appealing in 1999 but were a lot more resilient on the subsequent crash.

Futures volume on CME and CBOE have been anemic.  The problem is  institutional money don't have much interest in trading bitcoin atm.  Adoption will take some time, having unregulated exchanges that keeps getting "hacked" and investors losing hundreds of millions is a huge problem.

That's probably true, but the banks will learn blockchain technology in these types of experiments(while getting paid), and will band together and come up with their own new cryptos
These would be huge threats to the existing coins, including BTC

Network equipment powered the Internet, so they're relevant for sure.  Besides qualcomm, hardware companies such as Cisco, Nortel, Lucent, Juniper, JDS Uniphase and Ciena were all bubble stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:14:18
Yeah a 70% drop from ATH (19.8k -&gt; 5.9k) isn't even close to being the worst BTC bear market ever.  The key is BTC has come back stronger after a 94% crash before.
As long as you're mentally prepared for what a prolonged bear market might look like.  Stop losses might come in very handy too.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:44:09
Good explanation of speculator psychology!
Besides traders who actually experienced a massive bubble firsthand (e.g. dot com bubble), most folks are not mentally prepared for how nasty the ensuing bear market can become.
Markets tend to swing from one emotional extreme(greed) to another(fear), exhibiting some symmetry - the greedier it was, the more fearful it becomes later.
