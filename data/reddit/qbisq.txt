It's not trashing, this is a big issue. The better decentralized exchanges there are, the safer and stronger the bitcoin world will be. Having this huge honey pots isn't sustainable &amp; Polo can take a little poking. 
The whole point of a decentralized exchange is that it can't (or at least shouldn't if it's build well) go off-line or get hacked.

True. Thought isn't it only Wave assets.  The thing about Bisq is that it's all kinds of Alts + Bitcoin/Lite/Doge to Fiat.

@_date: 2017-08-01 11:50:51
LOL, thanks for the compliment!

Yeah the brainwashing is pretty bad, but I think if something is explained clearly and well enough, while conforming to normie PC guide lines, truth is hard to deny. At least that's what I think.Granted, there will always be some idiots that are incurable. 
I mean, if you have enough attention span to read a blog post you might be in a good position. Also  because coins are crashing some people must be more receptive to changing the way they look at things... donno

@_date: 2017-05-18 08:48:58

@_date: 2017-05-16 13:21:36

@_date: 2017-05-11 21:39:55
this might help 
@_date: 2017-05-03 08:45:29
Looks like brianwashed dude has picked a side. The collectivist propoganda has sucsseded. Sad and dosn't further a solution.

I can't wait for the day I can not pay my taxes in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:01:01
Doesn't Bitshares only let you trade synthetic coins?
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:49:36
 I am aware of that lolz aspect, I can assure you thought Bisq has more than 1 and only user...there are actually 3 user. j/k.  
Ok, help raise the liquidity, this is an amazing program.

I'm new to posting on Reddit - how come my post isn't showing up on the first page of "last 24 hours" even thought it has enough votes? :(. Is it because of the "inflammatory" language?

Looks like you've picked up a meme. The jewish propaganda has succeeded. Sad and dosn't further a solution.

Nope, planning to take part in the d.a.o though and contribute to the project...
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:05:58
Thank you. It's the second time I got it wrong when making a meme. Maybe this time the right spelling will stick...

I can't disagree it's somewhat cumbersome (thought it's going to be improved!), but there's nothing political about the client. The programs dose it's things...
