nah.  Ya gotta do the opposite.  Shop at Purse.io -- as much as you can.  They really helped me out by giving me a job.  I like doing MadBitcoins, but it really didn't pay the bills and now I have a lot of bills.  I hope to do more episodes in the future and am trying out a new show called MadSteemit.  I hope you'll check it out. -- and I still do The Bitcoin Group every week on WCN and am very active on twitter and in the SF Bitcoin Meetup (which I help organize).  Still very active in crypto, just have a job now.  Nothing wrong with that.  :)

I know the voice is an acquired taste but it comes with the character.... the rest is a mixture of shyness, bright lights, no teleprompter and necessity is the mother of invention.  You might like The Bitcoin Group, I still do a bit of a voice there, but the content is much more front and center....

I'm a big fan of GTD, although I've fallen away from most of the systems I read about in the book.

Today I'm donating to six charities using ChangeTip on Twitter.  I don't have much money, but I'm donating a dollar to each.  
I'm writing a personal message to each one and if they don't accept ChangeTip, I plan to write an email to each one explaining in a very basic way how to create an account and why they should do so (to avoid losing tips).  I'll also include basic information about how to sign up for Coinbase to link their account so they can withdraw their money.  
Here is a list of the charities.  Most already accept bitcoin and probably have changetip set up.  Some will have never heard of bitcoin, but I hope they will accept.  
Let's do some good!
