It's equally stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:49:10
Just because a fool is right some of the time doesn't mean it's a good idea to make foolish decisions.

When I scan the qr code? I don't ever remember some kind of seed 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:45:51
I'm not saying bitcoin is a ponzi scheme but comments like yours sure make it sound like it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:55:53
Nobody can help someone as stupid and greedy as you. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:13:48
The QR code itself is a backup seed that can be used again any time in the future? That would answer my question.

I always figured if I had access to my google account I would be able to access my auth on another device but have never needed to. Is that false? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:49:53
Do you know what literally means?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:53:03
That isn't successful, that is losing in the world of crypto. In Less that six month I have made 500% on my bitcoin, 220% on my eth, 200% on ltc, 600% on iota, 200% on ICX, and 1,200% on raiblocks. If I had got LUCKY day trading might be up 20-50% total, and down if I was unluck. You are only fucking yourself over in the end.

I moved some bitcoin from my ledger last week and payed "standard" level fee of $67. It has nothing to do with coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:25:23
I just tried looking through the settings for a seed but couldn't find it. Can you explain how to find it or link to somewhere explaining? Hearing this makes me scared take my phone out of my house with all my wallets and exchange account on Google auth.

Sounds like your dad has a dumb ass kid who can't even do basic arithmetic, I'm not sure I would listen to him.

First mover advantage doesn't last forever and is really the biggest thing bitcoin has going for it still. I still hold some btc in my portfolio but I am betting on my alts experiencing faster growth in 2018.

If you're so broke that you have to borrow $3500 (to buy $2201 worth of bitcoin) you definitely should not be investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:30:53
Blindly calling alts shitty just sounds like you are making yourself intentionally ignorant because they don't benefit your bitcoin investment. Bitcoin is not the end all be all to distributed public ledgers, that isn't how technology works. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:53:48
Except every day their are better and better alternatives. Acting like bitcoin is the end all be all to block chain technology is like living in 1910 and insisting that the model T will be the best top selling car ever made. Technology doesn't work like that.

If you have less than $1000 worth it's not really worth it to move it off of an exchange. If you want to move around smaller sums of money exchange it for lite coin or ether.

Keep telling yourself whatever you need to to justify bad trades while other people got rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:08:22
Because everyone here knows you are full of shit and have no idea how to do that or else you would be a billionaire with more important things to do than trying to convince people on reddit how smart you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:46:38
That would cost him 20% of his investment, definitely not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:25:11
Lol, this is so stupid. I doubt there is a single person in the world who diversified into solid alts that regrets it. My entire portfolio (Which holds a significant amount of btc) is up 110% while bitcoin has been falling. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:54:14
At your impossibly stupid choices, you deserve to lose everything if you aren't trolling. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:47:27
And it's obvious that you only did it very few times and got very lucky, or much more likely you are totally full of shit and lieing to strangers on the Internet to make yourself feel better about your own dumb choices that cost you tons of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:31:14
The only people who care when bitcoin plummets are the people who bought in 2 weeks before, sounds like you are still butt hurt about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:21:10
Good to know, I had no idea I was supposed to be backing those up. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:35:35
All I see is a sad attempt to beg for money by attaching a qr code to your wallet on an otherwise wholesome pick. Pretty pathetic OP. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:41:03
There is an almost infinite number of price points that were ATH at the time that would have screwed you over and you would either still be waiting or lost all your profit selling low buying high. You aren't fooling anyone by  pretending you have some amazing skill that everyone else fails at consistently over a long period. You just sound like a very sad man trying to convince strangers on the Internet how smart you are.

"A lot of money" Really made way less money than if he had just done nothing after buying, unless he bought last week.
