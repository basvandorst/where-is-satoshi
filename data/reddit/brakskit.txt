1) It doesn't matter what the US government decides, if people want to use it it will be used. Reference: drugs, prostitution, illegal immigration, abortion, illegal guns, and other world countries.
2) People don't act because they have no alternatives. This is an alternative, but not many people know about it. High-profile senate hearings publicize BitCoin, so that more people will realize how useful it is, and this spurs demand.
3) There are no valid argument against BitCoin. There are economic "story telling" arguments, and predictive "doom and gloom by story telling" arguments, and false equivalences with closely related things (fraudulent exchanges, Silk Road, &amp;c), and outright lies ("it's a Ponzi scheme!!!"), but no actually valid arguments.)
4) All the standard aphorisms apply: buggy-whip manufacturers, the invisible hand, liquidity, privacy and freedom.
BitCoin will become a game-changer (oh, that phrase!) simply because nothing can stop it.

I'm a bit worried that they'll invent something so good that the government will feel the need to defend their fiat and do something horrible.

New or used?
@_date: 2014-05-02 23:36:59
Why wouldn't they?

When you consider what the "law" has done for/to us it's just fair to pirate.

Are you trying to scare away new users? Have never encrypted my wallet and never will, still have all my coins.

Selling it ASAP will just drive the price down, so this is actually bad for Bitcoin! Somebody please tell me I'm wrong.

Sounds plausible, should we start digging for backdoors?

Never, Google Wallet is the enemy.

Doing things the way they've always been done isn't much of an answer.
Let's use movies as an example. The way it is now (apart from not being able to use Bitcoin) is that somebody that may have a completely different view of the movie decides how much everybody gets paid. If I love the script but hate the special effects, why shouldn't I get to decide that writer(s) get paid more than the special effects team? Why keep this all-or-nothing attitude when you can reward precisely the people that do a good job?

You wouldn't care either, if you knew what "checks" Uber do.

Openssl is open source too. Has anyone audited the Bitcoin source? If not maybe it's time to start the funding.

Go away, agent. Tell your masters that their tactics don't work on us.

And which one is the most anonymous and has sellers that accept po boxes?

Correction: NO fees!
