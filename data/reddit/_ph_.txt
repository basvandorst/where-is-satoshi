Basically sign an oath declaring that you renounce citizenship; generally the expectation is that you no longer live in the US following this. Remaining in the US becomes complicated because you then technically become an illegal alien, and would need a visa or green card to stay here.

Generally speaking, that's called living in a society where we believe humans have fundamental rights, and furnishing those rights costs money- be it food, shelter, or medicine. I'm sorry if I fail to sympathize with wealthy people who are upset that the cost of living in society is taxes, and they feel it's unfair. On a more practical level, the costs of living in society are constant within an area regardless of how much you earn. This means that if we need to redistribute wealth in order to bring people up to this basic standard of existence, it logically should come from those who will be least impacted by the cost, meaning the wealthy. This justifies the situation you just described, where the people who pay the most get the least, and vice versa. Of course, this is before going into the documented economic benefits of ensuring that the basic needs of living are covered, none the least of which is allowing for some amount of deregulation as the free market actually functions the way we think it should.

That's sort of the issue- you'd become a "stateless person", and that's sort of a legal grey area.

Theft generally doesn't benefit you. If you believe taxes don't benefit you, you are free to renounce your citizenship and become free of paying all taxes.

Also a botnet is where a hacker has infected a number of computers with a virus that allows him to hijack some of the functions of the computer. Done subtly, this allows DDoS type attacks, and any other use that might require a large number of computers operating simultaneously.

So what you're saying is that Nixon used his crafty and conniving ways both to attempt Watergate and to secure the US's economic dominance?

Im guessing that long term, it'll stabilize around $200/btc. When we get there and it stays at $200 +/-$50 for about 8 months, then ill be comfortable relying heavily on btc.

Compare it to regular fiat cash. I know that I do work and receive cash, which I trade for stuff I want or need. I don't know exactly how money is produced, very little about economics, I'm a programmer so I'll skip open source, etc.
It's sort of like saying you need to be a mechanic to drive a car.

The most trivial counter-example is healthcare. It is fundamentally incompatible with a free market. Suppose you get hit by a car and are rushed to the nearest hospital. You don't have an opportunity to evaluate the prices of surrounding hospitals - if there's even more than one - and make an informed decision about where to spend your money. You just get stuck with the nearest one, whatever their rates are- there are no market forces regulating prices here.
Your example about comcast being granted a monopoly is an example of what I mentioned earlier- individuals who have a financial interest in the private option.
Monopolies existed before government intervention to stop them, like the oil barons of the 1800s. Unregulated free markets uniformly result in pseudo-feudalism. The fact that some monopolies are allowed to exist doesn't change this; and, the fact that monetary monopolies were granted by people who had monopolies on violence also doesn't change this. 
A monopoly on access to a local physical resource is not equivalent to a monopoly on a market.

That's plenty equitable but entirely ineffective. There are services in society that are not compatible with a profit motive, or require a regulating force to keep prices from becoming unreasonably high due to local monopolies- for an example, Comcast.
I think bitcoin is better than gold and both are better than fiat as a currency. I don't think bitcoin is currently as accessible to the average person as dollars, and I don't think any business accepts gold though.

Provide a solution that is similarly equitable and effective when compared to taxation. If you have no alternative, then you're just complaining about the costs of living in a society because you think they're unfair.
I should note that those private sector alternatives are usually used because the public options have been hamstrung and/or underfunded by individuals who have financial interests in the private option. If you look at governments that do not do this, all of these systems are more effective and more used than the private options.

No, but that is the upper limit of what it could be worth; of course, by that point, dollars would cost 1/3.8 mil bitcoin

In california waiters still make $4-ish an hour so long as after tips they make more than $8, and if the tips dont add up to $8 an hour the employer has to pay the difference.
