I'm a Korean citizen and calculated this for a while. If I get a trustworthy partner in the States to split the profit 1:1, the annual max profit is 4,500 USD at the price gap of 20%. That will get me a new macbook or a nice designer bag, but is not in any way a life-changing sum of money and not worth getting on the watch-list of my bank or spending all my foreign transfer limits; I need the limit for taking holidays and stuff.

Sorry, pardon my wording. more like regulation than restriction. I don't think they can ban cryptocurrency at this point. Tax, limits on transactions, harder authorization processes are more likely. They kind of have to have something now that they said they are coming up with something.

Everybody, including middle school girls, at least heard about what it is. I know a portion of people who are well-educated and have believed that blockchain is the future for years. There is also another part of the bithumb who are just there because they don't want to be 'left out' while not understanding what exactly Bitcoin is. 
This is kind of irrelevant, but I don't think any one of them are thinking about North Korea threats when it comes to cryptocurrency thou. So NK does not have a role unlike some articles suspect.

I live in Seoul and the government is looking into passing a bitcoin regulation bill according to today's news. The price on bithumb will make or break depending on what they come up with next week. Complete ban on cryptocurrency is unlikely, but still... I already got my seed money out long ago and am stilling hodling, but i worry about the people I know here who invested in bitcoin without not necessarily believing or agreeing with the idea. This wouldn't be a fun weekend for them.

Yup, you also need a mobile phone from a Korean service provider and a Korean bank account for authorization and transfers. Once you have all of that, the authorization can only take five minutes. Transferring bitcoin is a bitch and there is extended delay time for confirmation, so google-translate and read everything on the 공지사항 board before opening up an account.

This was on the prime time news today.

I think a lot of them are just that. Kids as young as thirteen yrs old can open up an authorized bithumb account with a mobile phone here.
