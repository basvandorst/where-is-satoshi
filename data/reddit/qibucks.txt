Looks like the shorters and dumpers have won again, don't expect a bull market at this rate before 2020, if ever.

I am very excited here: 
    One startup, Global Bitcoin ATM Ltd, plans to install five machines per month in the UK
 As I am an early investor in this project and today we were all over the news and exploding, even on Yahoo UK! I can't wait to tell my Family in the U.K that they can go and buy some coin from a machine from a company that is going global..and one I had faith and promise in. Bank Of The Future will also showcase it in the crowd funding section as well so micro investors can get a piece of the cake too as well as individual Investors who wish to purchase a machine and get it placed by Global Bitcoin ATM ltd.

The Company is real. The Directors are real and I also am an Investor and have a vested Interest in the project also. I am based near Vancouver at present and have visited and purchased BTC twice from the the Machine in Wave's cafe. The GBA website is under development at the moment and most of the early capital has already been raised just through word of mouth and the Company is backed up by some big BTC legends and very interested Parties. Once you all see the first machine up and running purchased an displaced by GBA I hope that will dispel any doubts you have about GBA. Also for anyone interested in this wonderful project they can join a skype room we have there for Investors who are interested. Also like one member just posted you can contact Robocoin directly to verify the legitimacy of GBA. You will be pleasantly surprised.
