@_date: 2015-06-12 16:21:54
sure, the refund to a charge doesnt apply for a day or two, but I think most people arent broke enough to care since they made the purchase in the first place thus assuming that money was gone. with credit cards, I have greater trust for the credit card company to have my back than some bitcoin scam company who knows bitcoin is trustless and chargebacks arent possible with btc.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:04:20
honestly, I dont need the money. bitcoin was just a toy I played with in the past. I am not hodling because im stuck with a bag and ive never looked at bitcoin as an investment. imo, you "rational" speculators are everything that is wrong with btc. if you were rational, you poor fucks wouldn't be buying virtual lottery tickets with your minute disposable income

except you need to deal with a less regulated, possibly scam based exchange to get your money out. fee calculation analyses have actually shown its much higher in reality. the chargeback issue means buyer gets fucked instead.

thank you for commenting with basis in reality. it's refreshing. we should also realize that "secure" is a relative term - would you also agree with the recent calculations that show that bitcoin can be denied or subverted for just $5k/day?

I thought it was two weeks(tm). man whats with the goal posts around here?
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:20:21
actually, the original fundamentals touted around have now been shown to be bullocks. anonymity? nope. coinbase bans people by monitoring their transactions. fast? nope, 2.7 txn per sec at best. robust? nope, for $5k a day the network can be denied. no fee transactions? nope, service layers on top, like atms, lead to 25% fee on small txns? decentralized? y..nope. increasing centralization, not to mention the handful of bitcoin lords who hodl 99% mktshare. flexible? nope, cant even implemented blocksize increase, 1 line of code. I could go on, but I think the only fundamental left is DNMs. my prediction 1 year from now btc is trading sub $60
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:12:24
yeah, i might be wrong. as this sub illustrates time and time again, there is no shortage of stupid people. the debacle i was referring to was basically the whole situation surrounding the mt gox scam and people buying into $900 cheap coins all the way down to where we are today.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:51:56
no not really. but it is an interesting thing to consider: does the world need a trustless ledger?
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:08:07
sure, the blockchain is a public ledger and they actively track what you do with your btc, often several hops out. there have been many posts of people getting banned from coinbase because they were suspected to buy cannabis, etc.

Your autism is showing. My initial comment was a joke with a bit of truth. Your response is setting up a strawman with basis in pedantry of my original comment. In a non-rigorous sense, yes, after you deposit fiat it does take 4 days to actually "receive" your bitcoin (from coinbase) [...assuming you dont have a visa credit card]
  
For added clarity and specificity which seems needed, coinbase is quoted because it is the source of the statement. Again, this was me making light of it. Y so srs bro?

Before the Internet (particularly the www), nothing like it existed. And so I agree with that point. Currently, millions of people have flawless interactions with our current monetary system. Bitcoin addresses only a few pains of a few libertarians mostly at a philosophical level. Not to be myopic, but when I compare the excitement around the introduction of the www to the masses with bitcoin, it's totally different. Note: I'm actually pro bitcoin but the false analogies to Egypt and most of the delusional comments really make me cringe.)

No problem. Im not disputing its flaws and I think its likely we are coming from different places in terms of perspective. I actually didn't even consider what it would be like coming to php as a beginner-surely yes there are a lot of pitfalls. I have been using php since the early days so naturally ive learned about the oddities, pitfalls, and evolution of the language in increments while probably taking the cumulative burden those things create for granted.  I use php for profit and other languages for personal projects. It is indeed a perilously productive language.

I explained it t o her in simple terms and she asked where she could spend it... Why would she restrict her options to overstock etc? As an investment vehicle? ...Nope, too volatile. I just don't see the common persons use case; it's not a great investment (too risky), it has no advantage for consumer spending. This leaves only p2p transfer of value  (sending money)...it really doesn't happen that much. The only way I see bitcoin succeeding on a large scale now is in third world adoption. Everything I've seen lately are novelties and contrived things. Is anyone actually doing anything interesting with it? Why should I be compelled to use bitcoin nowadays? Why should I care that big company xyz is accepting bitcoin? Why would I take the time to acquire bitcoin to spend it at this company? I'm very open minded and actually wish bitcoin would succeed.

I agree with your sentiment and the logic around preparing for scale, but the striking difference is that btc offers no practical advantage while also requiring an absurd amount of technical ability for the avg person to use and secure. in 1995 there was no shortage of viable ideas for the web (among technical people), but there were difficult constraints.  to contrast, here we have technically advanced people still searching for a compelling reason to displace money. "be your own bank" only appeals to preppers and black marketeers and such. If you cant tell I just really think the early Internet comparison is a disingenuous to sucker in the gullible into believing in that type of market expansion, and thus price increase.

Perhaps what you're missing is that the analysis is not just comparing the *direct* fees in a bitcoin transaction versus a credit card transaction as that wouldn't be telling the whole story. 
  
Looking at the whole picture (what's really required), if I wanted to go send someone BTC for "free", I'd have to first purchase bitcoin (coinbase takes a fee to buy it) and then my counterparty would pay a fee to convert back to USD. You might say, well, that's not fair! Just store your money in BTC... but volatility.
  
Edit: Not to mention, it takes me 5 business days via coinbase to obtain my coins (ridiculously slow) and then probably 3 more business days to turn it back into cash via ACH. In the case where I wasn't actively storing bitcoin, it'd be faster to just mail a check.

Yea but that analysis makes no sense. It's been one year of trending down more than it's ever been worth. In most businesses they look at the prior 6 months to discuss trend, not 4 years ago. I'm so sick of seeing this fallacy on this sub. Bitcoin clearly jumped the shark , $300 price level is just residual of its $1000 bubble. I stand by my prediction, in 3-6 months bitcoin will be $50-100/each.

Yep,this is the chicken and egg problem and for most people (especially people without much money) it doesn't make sense to buy into a declining asset as your money obviously becomes even less. Yet, philosophically this is what needs to happen is for everyone to have the same faith. I'm pretty sure the bitcoin community appreciates people like you willing to take a loss in the interim for the cause, despite it not being financially wise. I hope bitcoin succeeds and it's people like you who deserve the benefit if it ever does.

If there was a system wide failure, I highly doubt bitcoin is going to be the answer for even 1% of people, but rather hard assets. What if the Internet goes down? Anyway, the prospect of systemic failure is not something I really want to debate as I see that as far off and unlikely and for now I don't entertain the doomsday prepper mentality. I mean to each his own, but to me that's really tinfoil and batshit crazy.
  
Also wheres the audit with the last few failed exchanges? How is the current paradigm not just replacing banks with even shadier unregulated exchanges? And lastly, where the hell would people spend their bitcoin in such a scenario? Who would accept it? If the economy came crashing to a hault, pretty sure Internet is gone leaving a small populace of people who own bitcoin and perhaps want to trade amongst themselves - but the market outside of that would be nonexistent

I wouldn't call $300 "cheap"....I would call $1200 a bubble. I think $300 is still a really decent premium. I'd imagine they'll be $50-100 once stable.
  
Edit: a recurring problem I see with this sub is that if anyone so much as mentions a price less than the current price, they get downvoted by the cult of bitcoin hoping for the moon on price which considers it only as an object for speculation. With that said, looks like I'm on track with my opinion as bitcoin is now continuing its trend, dropping to $280.

Enjoy your $20 loss (at least) per btc because its currently at $280 and falling.

@_date: 2015-01-14 16:49:35
Yea, but as I imagine we both know, there are some real paradoxes and catch-22s in the way of that future idealism. For example, as we've seen, the more merchants that adopt bitcoin, the lower the price is driven (each purchase is converted to USD instantly - or in other words - BTC is sold, putting downward price pressure.) From the perspective of merchants, no one is really using bitcoin to purchase, so there's no incentive to accept. Lots of chicken-egg stuff. I could go on, but I assume you're very familiar yourself.

Is there any way with Coinbase to convert BTC to USD instantly and keep the USD in the Coinbase account? I basically don't want to have to wait to withdraw funds and then redeposit, etc. for my next purchase
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:07:05
Well, not really - only if you take your point about the US dollar being backed by gold, which I said nothing about. Technically, I'm still right - you just threw in some extra pedantry about its gold backing, but it was still the US Dollar and so my original statement is still accurate despite the fact I acknowledged your point (which doesn't change the merit of my original point.) The only relevant currencies you should be looking at when comparing bitcoin should be the established ones still in existence.

As a small business adopting an unfamiliar technology I want support, but bitpay support is $300/mo and I doubt I'd see $300 in btc sales in a month. They have to figure something else out. Perhaps take the lead of the exchanges and pursue a more profitable industry that's not bitcoin related.

Problem is, wasn't the cost savings of bitcoin recently debunked vis-a-vis western union? I mean for most people, there's a fee to buy and a fee to sell. Also, I just bought some bitcoins to show a friend via coinbase last Friday and by the time I receive them they're down like 40% lol.

@_date: 2015-01-19 23:48:31
I thought this was one the main appeals? Send money anywhere for free. While there aren't really intrinsic bitcoin fees, so long as the other fees can't be avoided there goes another potentially huge use case in which btc falls down when put in front of the mainstream. So long as btc can't be efficiently converted to and from fiat, there's no real value or potential of becoming its own legit economy.
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:30:32

@_date: 2015-01-08 21:00:29
Wait, no, that my estimation of how long the "US currency has been in existence" should not be the focus, all pedantry aside. The focus should be on the fact it makes no sense whatsoever to talk about relative longevity of bitcoin versus third world currencies. But of course - we don't want to talk about *that*.

Cool theory! I think you're on to something, but the 'orderly decline' is likely the mechanics of supply exceeding demand. The whales are having a lot of trouble finding buyers so they're forced to trickle sell. Once all the whales/early adopters have cashed out, the market of bagholders should stabilize the price and finally establish the needed volatility and merchant synergy for eventual moon. I for one am going all in if BTC drops to about 50ish.

@_date: 2015-04-26 14:29:47


Obvious solution is obvious. As soon as the blockchain voting prototype reaches production quality, voting and maintenance of the list will be decentralized just like bitcoin. Smart contracts on a sidechain are the solutiom to all of these short sighted problems you mentioned.

1. 
  
2. I think it missed its one major shot to achieve escape velocity by finding brand appeal and a use case for the mainstream. vcs have lost interest. too many scams. infighting. cult behavior. tax classification. large exits. foundation bankrupt. its not so much I think itll cease to exist, but that itll be a stagnant, and eventually fast declining financial instrument (in terms of price). if not for dark mkt, it would be reduced to pog status.

in the free market sometimes innovation can come from anywhere. if this proves to be superior to bitcoin with the backing power of Amazon maybe they'll open source the code and a new better bitcoin can be developed with Amazon's source code for the basis. not sure what the licensing would look like (hopefully mit), but the way im looking at this news is a positive signal for crypto.

theres a gem in your comment that I just now excavated.

They use the same basic model, but can add specializations and learn from the mistakes made in bitcoin (fast follower, low barrier to entry.) to be realistic here, bitcoin doesnt really have that strong of network effects yet so it is vulnerable to being superseded by an alt. its only defenses are in the vc backed ecosystem and a cultish following (no offense intended by the use of the word cultish here)

You speak about bitcoin like it is an animate object. Reality is, bitcoin doesn't have feelings about anything.


  


  
So your argument is essentially that the solution to bitcoin adoption is hand waving about some intrinsic properties in which (1) it still exists and (2) it's reliable? Sorry, if that's the best argument you can make, you lose. Not only do you lose, but you're a *loser*. Better arguments for how to increase bitcoin adoption abound, and you can't even point to one?

1 btc = 1 btc. In this scenario USD went down 7%

Here's something I don't understand....why would I convert cash to bitcoin then spend bitcoin so it can be converted back to cash? Why wouldn't I just pay cash ? Also I mean I guess he could survive for a week even if that meant drinking coffee ($25 at a time) and not eating....

The thing that's glossed over is that the show was about living on bitcoin for a week. He couldn't do it. Of course, this point was never addressed after the intro to the show.

I've been using bitcoin for a while and still trying to figure out how I do something useful with it

You're going to explain mfa and multisig to your grandma? K
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:39:04
In the same way people still don't use secure passwords and never will, this will be an unachievable target and bitcoin will never go mainstream ...there just isn't enough incentive anyway for regular people to learn
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:03:04
You're making a fallacious jump from your premise to conclusion by implying that bitcoin technology is better than the existing systems ergo it "technologically supersedes", but that is not demonstrably true. At best it is arguable, but until it is demonstrable to be technologically superior, our current financial systems are not legacy (chargeback as desirable behavior comes to mind. Max transaction volume. Etc.) You need both conditions of the definition to apply and the only condition I see as true is that the existing system is hard to replace. At current, we could not substitute bitcoin for usd and have a working system. It would fall on its face.
  
Do a thought experiment. Imagine completely replacing the dollar and surrounding systems (credit cards, banks, etc.) with just bitcoin. Would it scale? Are all needed use cases and properties met? If not, the dollar still serves a purpose and is by definition not "legacy" as much as the coiner evangelists in this sub would like to slander the existing system to advantage bitcoin marketing. I'd prefer to see bitcoin grow on its legitimate merits not on puffery or slander.

As a business owner, why the fuck would I want to discount my inventory to receive btc when I could receive USD at full price for less hassle and confusion?

What you just said implies that a 'coiner would only buy my product if and only if I accept bitcoin. Even if that were true, it makes no sense for either party as it's the act of spending his virtual  funbux that compels him to purchase something he doesn't want, and I have a customer not truly interested in my product or service, but trying to evangelize so he's not holding the bag.

Some of the rich have, some haven't, but that wasn't the point - the point is the people who are going to make money from bitcoin in a big way probably already have. Enjoy your sub $300 coin and falling

I wasn't speaking personally about it....I actually do speculate quite a bit. To be more clear, I was talking about the average person's reaction, who is not going to be a speculator interested in a "cheap coin trading opportunity" like you apparently  believe per your above comment.

Unless you want support..then isn't it like $300/month?

itll be funny when your brother's license is revoked and you have no recourse. thanks bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:15:59
what you said was ambiguous...are you implying the Internet doesn't have a reliable money transfer protocol or are you being sarcastic? Care to contribute something of value to the discussion?
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:46:56
Yup, and demand essentially comes from interested people in the mainstream, but unfortunately there is no reason for people in the mainstream to ever use bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:51:31
This borders on pedantic, but why do people regularly qualify the banking system as "legacy" in this sub? Something is not "legacy" until it's been actually replaced. And in this case, bitcoin replacing the current system is no more than a highly improbable pipedream. This would be like me incorrectly referring to bitcoin as vaporware and defaming the bitcoin industry as a cult.
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:26:24
They just followed the standard bitcoin security guide

Who the fuck here cares what OP believes? Yes, I'm really asking. No offense OP, but your iq is apparently comparable to the sheeple in an infowars comment thread and your comments are my fix of comedy for the night. Go fuck yourself San Diego

So bitcoin has finally become so desperate it has devolved into sad try hard memes that'll only reach an equally stupid and disinterested audience of 9gaggers? Its like this sub has become a collection of all the stupid people left holding the shovels and continuing to dig when the mine has long been depleted and the rich have cashed out. With that said, I have a investment thesis for the next opportunity (not bitcoin related)
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:36:55
Reason  to start an investment company/exchange and be able to easily cash out with early investor funds if a hack occurs

dude, by definition, that code is blacklisting. how do you not know this? arent you one of the main bitcoin maintainers? 
  
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:55:04
Thanks for making my point. Lets look up what "superseded" means now: ˌso͞opərˈsēd/
past tense: superseded; past participle: superseded
take the place of (a person or thing previously in authority or use); supplant.
  
to spell it out for you - Bitcoin has clearly not taken the place of money, therefore it has not made the banking system "legacy".
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:58:43
I think it should look more like a bot...and maybe name him willy
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:04:28
Actually it is feasible, treat bitcoins being mined elsewhere like another network and allow internetwork transfers to take place, but with a delay analogous to transferring money from one bank to another today

The thing I don't like about changetip is that it takes this really beautiful technology and turns it into an aol chat room gimmick, like emojis, used by what looks to be a bunch of spamming newbs from the outside.
