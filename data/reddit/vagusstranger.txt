Isn't this taken from r/btc? The original caption was about block size restriction.

As a non-economist I found this very interesting. Are there any crypto-enthused economists here that can respond to the points in the article?

Great response! I didn't want to prejudice the discussion but I definitely considered your responses 2 and 3 myself.  
A criticism that I can see as being both a "pro" and a "con" of crypto is that as the value of bitcoin is merely representative of physical goods rather than having intrinsic value like an asset (as you say, a goldbug viewpoint) then the argument that Bitcoin is closer to digital fiat than digital gold has some merit.  
Of course, the truth is more complex than a binary good vs bad, and like you say it may end up coexisting with fiat [and gold?], as it has advantages and disadvantages relative to either.

Not a concern troll, if I ask ethtrader it isn't on topic. If I ask r/btc I'll get their biased opinion. It seemed prudent to ask r/bitcoin as it's within the current discussion.  
I admit BTC isn't a majority of my holdings, but whatever form technological form BTC takes it's historically and currently incredibly important.  
I did try to phrase my question as neutrally as possible, and if you got through my post history on r/bitcoin I hope that the other posts read neutrally too. I'm not trying to be banned, I just want to understand this debate from both sides.  
  Thank you for answering my question in part, but you can keep the partisan vitriol to yourself.

This is an interesting point to be fair. Has there been any data generated on how many of those nodes would stay on Bitcoin Core should the fork commence?  
I mean to say although everyone running a full node has clearly chosen core software, how many of these are politically aligned with 1x vs 2x?  
The picture appears to support mass support for 1x in full nodes, but in a game of chicken between miners and users as suggested above who would come out on top?

I'm not asking about ETH, or any other altcoins. I visit altcoin subs to ask about altcoins.
