If your plan was to hold long term, you won't have a problem.  New day traders freak out and sell at a loss.
My teenage son wanted to invest his money in 2016 and mentioned Bitcoin.  I told him it was a good idea if he planned to hold it at least a year, preferably 3-5 yrs.  He got in at $640, and he's a HODLer.

I'm assuming a 2nd node would help contribute to the cause of keeping Bitcoin secure (by verifying transactions).  The more nodes the better.  Want to use RPI3, because my other/1st node is a wattage hog (gaming computer too), and I would run the RPi3 24x7 instead of 18hr or so like I do now.

Meh.  His giving up exposes a very naive view of the world.  Apparently he thought bitcoin was Nirvana somehow.  Bitcoin will survive just fine without him. 
The reason free markets work so well for human flourishing is that we are all ultimately, selfish.  It is very counter intuitive, but leave us all to our own devices and we will take care of ourselves and our families first, and by necessity that means getting along with others. 
Being a Bitcoin developer requires being a grown up with a truthful, grown up understanding of the world, the proper world view to enable one to work with others.

I'm a software engineer too, and I bet I have more experience and have been doing it longer than you.
The point you're missing is Bitcoin's mission is first and foremost to avoid censorship.
The second point you're missing is large blocks brings censorship via centralization of required mining hardware and network.
You calling these disagreements "politics", including that certain people won't give in to the desire for some people's big blocks, is ignorant of Bitcoin's mission and ignorant of the fact that your argument is nothing new.  
You must be at least the 10,000th person to whine about "why can't we have big blocks too?".

In it's current iteration, Bitcoin use for a retail shop transaction is clunky and not user friendly at all, so that has to change before the general public accepts it.
That fraud and insurance protection you mention is why Visa/Master card transactions are so expensive - it doesn't come free.  It's like "free healthcare" or "free college" - it's not really free, someone is paying for it.  They put mechanisms in place for fraud prevention and transaction item insurance, and those mechanisms require extra people with salaries to be paid and extra IT infrastructure (hardware/applications/network) to deliver those services.
Every time a retail transaction occurs, 2%-4% is added on without the buyers' agreement or knowledge by retailers hiking their prices to cover those transaction amounts they have to pay. But plenty of people and retailers want to use Bitcoin because there is no 4% transaction fee (current block chain memory pool notwithstanding) that gets tacked onto the price of items we buy.  
There's also the value of Bitcoin being an international currency that is easily sent around the world, doesn't lose its value over time while users hang on to it as fiat currencies do, and doesn't have to be transmitted from Dollars to Yen to back again if I want to travel to Japan.
Bitcoin is a great savings account too, and this is another value that Visa/Mastercard don't give.  The Dollar continues to lose it's value with the Fed's monetary pumping policies.  The real/legitimate inflation rate is much higher than the official rate the Feds publish.
The dual nature of Bitcoin is what I find so powerful and unique about it:
1) Bitcoin is a store of value that appreciates over time
2) Bitcoin is also a currency that can be used for common transactions.  
Before 1900, the same thing was true of US Dollars.  The Dollars people held actually increased in purchasing power before modern Keynesian monetary policies kicked in with centralization from the Federal Reserve Bank
I could go on and on.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:10:42
Wow, that is a major public announcement.  I think this article will carry a lot of weight in the Core supporting community to switch over to BIP 148.  If Core provides an official -bip148 switch in an upcoming release, I think we'll have the 51% miner support locked in.

Silbert's "industry leaders compromise" was a cocky, arrogant, condescending presumption that they own Bitcoin, that their vote is more important than everyone else's vote.
Bitcoin is first and foremost TRUSTLESS. 
I don't trust Silbert or Bitmain, and especially not their publicly professed goals.
They're acting like the U.S. Congress, Ds and Rs coming together to compromise on when and how they're going to screw over citizens.  The best thing that could have happened is for them to have never met at all on this topic. 
Bitcoin is Trustless for the sake of defeating centralized government fiat money that continually devalues our money and censors our economic transactions.  End of story. 
If the free market can capitalize on that freedom, Great!  But BITCOIN IS NOT THE SERVANT OF BUSINESS PEOPLE - ITS CORE PRINCIPLE IS FREEDOM, and it affects this through trustless mathematics, not by trusting the signatories of Silbert's "compromise". 
And now we're supposed to throw off one yoke for the sake of another?  Screw Bitmain's bought and paid for shills who troll and fool otherwise bright business people who have forsaken Bitcoin's trustless foundations for the sake of pragmatism and short term gain. 
UASF!!  It can happen Aug 1 instead of 12-18 months from now  that will only satisfy Bitmain and company, while they buy time to regroup and keep Bitcoin held hostage.

At the time of the split, all historical transactions and historical coins are on both blocks, i.e. your coins are on both chains (you have two sets of coins).  
But after the split, any transactions on one chain only apply to that chain.  Basically, it's two two currencies at that point.

Complete lack of trust in what, people? 
You're asking to trust in the goodwill of people, people who have demonstrated reasons not to trust them.  The genius of Bitcoin is trusting in the math only, not any person, oligarchs or governments.  Any protocol that continues towards centralization is trusting people instead of math.  2MB hard fork favors centralized ASIC Boost favored by an oligarch.

That's a naive argument at best - underhanded trolling at worst. 
After SegWit is activated, off chain scaling will eventually nullify the need for 2MB blocks.  
Any growth in the block size increases centralization by Bitcoin mining cartels, corporations and governments that want to suppress free currencies.  End user nodes (i.e. "full nodes") cannot compete with multi-million $ companies that easily afford the extra infrastructure required to create, store and broadcast bigger blocks through the network.  Bitcoin cartels are the friend of big government. 
Growth in the size of blocks will be the death of Bitcoin by eventually morphing it into the equivalent of fiat currency controlled by an oligarch.  
Barry Silbert's closed door meeting of cartel members and corporate suits clearly demonstrated they want, and are very close to, a hostile takeover of Bitcoin. 
UASF really is the last stand hope we have to keep the world's first and most valuable crypto currency out of the hands.

Educate yourself on the technology and how it works.  Read, read, read.  And of course, ALWAYS put your long term Bitcoin in a cold wallet.
When the chain split occurs, all historical transactions and coin are on both chains.  In other words, you'll have two sets of coins that will essentially be two currencies, regardless of the chain that gets to call itself "Bitcoin".  To transact with your coin on either chain, you'll need wallets that are compatible with each chain.

BIP 148 UASF - U can't stop it.

Yep, that's pretty much it.  The market will decide the price and viability of each.

You're welcome
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:57:16
I don't regard it as a leap of faith.  
If BIP148 gets the mining hashing power it needs to succeed, we'll have SegWit and instant-on scaling that is very safe.  If the chain splits, I'll follow the SegWit chain, because it can scale. 
What is a leap of faith about that?
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:36:49
Great response.  It is Bitpay that needs to change their business model.  Bitcoin just needs to stay decentralized and secure.

That's what I like about him...quick mind that quickly sees the logical ends of a position. He's right of course. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:57:17
I greatly respected him once too. But now he has become allied with Sauron with the deal between Bitpay and Bitmain.  He's done a 180.  Money talks.  I have lost all respect for him - now advocating 8mb blocks which is lunacy - he is no longer reasonable.  I have steered more than one company toward Bitpay, but no more.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:50:54
Wow, I think this is pretty magnanimous of  to code the best version of Silbert's "agreement" to ensure it's done right, when he doesn't even agree with larger blocks. He's lending his skills to the community at large to strengthen it. I think this speaks very well of his character and willingness to compromise.  
The above notwithstanding, USAF!!  Bitmain et al are scared to death of UASF because it guts their centralization efforts.  They know it will succeed and they will have to succumb to it.  So selfish - they still stand to gain millions after UASF triggers when they finally accept SegWit/1MB.

There's a big difference evoorhees between an innocent technology disagreement and trying to wrest control of an entire multi billion $ currency engine that Bitcoin has become. You don't seem to know the difference. 
There are some characters in the Bitcoin space that have publicly shown themselves to be 100% self-serving, and they ought to be publicly called out for what they are. Stop reacting as if they are all innocent. 
THE thing that brought many of, if not most, early adopters into Bitcoin was to fight the SOB's at the Fed who keep devaluing our money, including me - that's why I'm here - centralization only brings corruption and screwing the little guy.   Maybe you were just never part of the crowd who was attracted to Bitcoin for these reasons....

Straw man rebuttal - if he'd said Chinese you would have called that racism too.  His critique is about culture common to Asians, not about any race per se that is an inherited trait.  "Saving face" is common across many cultures, including Chinese.  PC language can be so ignorant.

Why wouldn't they?  In that case they'd be sure to earn the new 12.5 Bitcoin in the new block.  That's plenty of economic reason to mine.

Of course they did. Regulations are how they put food on their government tables

Seems within reach - ~33% hashing power has SegWit core code today.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:29:40
Well then, aren't you a good statist!
For every 100% of effort from the state, 95%+ is abuse of power.  People can live just fine without others imposing their will open them.

I just downloaded/installed the latest Litecoin Core, and the install is buggy - installed into hidden directories and the wrong directories from what I specified.  It's a good lab, but it's not ready for prime time in terms of real commerce.

UACOMMENT is worthless and does nothing to actually enforce the rules.  I wish that option had never been added - it only confuses things.

Maybe Bitpay folks can talk some sense into Bitmain's brain and convince to adopt Segwit.  The price of Bitcoin explode almost immediately after Segwit is adopted.

Silbert is such a sell out.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:47:52
Yep.  Those who who fight against SegWit and want bigger and bigger blocks are the equivalent of crony capitalists in bed with government.  If SegWit isn't working by years end, we probably have lost Bitcoin to them.
I wish a lot of people would wake up and realize this isn't just a technical difference of opinion about SegWit vs. big blocks.  This is ideology and world view wrapped up in a technical discussion.  
Big blocks -----&gt; centralization, the friend of government and other tyrants
SegWit -----&gt; decentralization, power to the people, freedom from tyrants of all flavors

Wrong. Currently Bitcoin hash power is controlled by a Chinese cartel of miners led by Bitmain.

It's not stupid at all.  
Wars are enormously expensive and historically have often thrown entire countries into bankruptcy and economic ruin.  The rise of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 allowed sophisticated monetary manipulation to fund wars and deficit spending via currency devaluation and a continual printing press of fiat money.
Central Banking is also what has allowed the massive deficit we (the U. S.) and many other countries now have.  With our Federal Reserve System, money is essentially created out of thin air to fund wars or bank bailouts or what have you.  The short term pain is fairly low, but the bill eventually comes due.  The 2008 mortgage crises is directly caused by the Feds with their free-market-defeating cheap money.

Have you ever been around someone in the office or school who is continually talking and readily giving his opinion, and simply because that person is talking while nobody else is talking, they come off having an air of authority and wisdom?  But they really don't have the authority or wisdom - they just talk a lot.  
That's Vinny.

Segwit 2x is not a compromise - it's a Trojan Horse to keep mining centralized.  2MB blocks is not needed, but Segwit is long overdue.

I don't agree this title is misleading.
Slush has always been a freedom oriented guy.  As such, he's opened his pool to allowing BIP 148, and as far as I know, he's the first and only pool to wholeheartedly allow BIP 148.  (Bitfury mined a block a while back, but they're not completely on-board with this like Slush is.)
In this way, this block is a symbolic beginning of the movement.
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:24:49
Slush is freedom and market oriented, same as me.  If folks want to mine BU and it's a better technology, it should win out.  But it's not, so it won't.  I never said he'll force miners in his pool to mine BIP148.

Regardless of whom she prosecuted, she's a Statist whore who can't find a job in the real world.  Get a life.  
Everyone should understand that Coinbase are not minimal government folks; they don't hate the tyranny and oppression of the US Feds.  They simply see things as they are, and they accept the status quo, and they seek to make money within the System.  
They are absolutely the kind of of folk I abhor, and you should too.  There's other (appropriate) monikers for them depending on your political persuasion: 1) the Left would call Coinbase the 1%ers, 2) the Right would call them Crony Capitalist.  Both are accurate.
