It will not be a payment method for your everyday groceries. It's a store of value. Buying a house, boat or something expensive. The transaction cost will become lower in the near future. Bitcoin cash and bitmain are fucjing with the mempool and making the transfer time very long because they want to have more value of their coin. It's a political game right now. Lightning network is already done but it withhold by Bitcoin cash. Once Bitcoin wins this fight expect it to go berserk.

The fees are low because people make fewer transactions! Bitcoin needs to step up its game if it doesn't want to get eaten by alts

What a dumb message. If the price fluctuates that much the future market will be shut down. If price goes up or down with more then 7%the market is shut down. So stop the trolling and the dumb and childish way of stressing people out. With the future market on its way price will stabilise more and more.

Yes you are buying cfd's but remember, the downsight of this is that the costs to buy and sell are huge in comparison on the real exchanges.

Why good for Bitcoin? You can use these chips to mine other coins than only Bitcoin so don't get you hopes up
