Bitcoin Maximalists have their heads so far up their butts that everything taste like $h!# to them. Because of this they can't see the innovations happening everywhere. 
These people are like the horses before cars,

It's not when you properly design a blockchain to take into account infrastructure and development cost. Check out Bitshares and see the way it should be done.

You should look into BitShares. It a decentralized exchange wjere you can hold BitUSD, BitGOLD, BitSILVER, BitOil, and many other assets. They have a physical reserve but ach asset collatorized by 3x it's value on in they system.  BitShares.org

Nice. Great info.

Bitshares is looking for UI/UX designers and is planning on using OpenBazaar for some things. If you have the skills you can be paid directly from the the blockchain with the Delegate system. Check out the forum and learn more.

The price feeds are a temporary measure to help keep the peg stable in the initial growth. Similar to how new sha256 coin can be disrupted if someone throws a ton of hashpower at it  early. As the volume in bitusd grows the algorithm to maintains the pegs  becomes stronger .

Sending one bitcoin or a thousand coins at once is still one transaction. So

I was there over the weekend and checked it out. I started the process of selling some bitcon for cash but didn't go through with it because of the request for a hand print. Just didn't want to give up my bio-metric data like that.  I didnt try buying form it, but I did buy some hotdogs from Coney Island dog restaurant with bitcoin. No hiccups. The vendor showed my the QR code on the iPAd, I scanned with phone and paid from my Myceliium wallet. Five seconds later he had the funds. Nice and smooth.

I bought a $5 card and was to use it at Starbucks, but never got me change back in Bitcoin like they said.

Over 70% of the current wealth on the planet is owned by less than 1%. I don't see him complaining about that.

It's messy and tragic for the people who have money stuck in GOX but that's capitalism. Do we want entities in Bitcoin to be to big to fail? If one business or entity can bring down Bitcoin from failing then there is a major flaw in the system and Bitcoin should fail. Gox dying the short term is messy and unfortunate, but it will make the system stronger as a whole.

Anything that perfectly pegs USD is an IOU that by definition incurs counterparty risk. BitUSD is not an IOU. It uses market forces to track the value of usd which means it will not always be perfect. 
Part of the reason it off by so much right now is because of a shorting bug. This bug will be resolved on tuesday with the next fork.

Anyone planning a crowdfund should definitely take in consideration these factors.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:57:18
But then you have to trust the exchange. Your BitUSD is on the blockchain, not an IOU from an exchange.

Bitshares can handle 1000tps with 3s confirmations at the moment and can scale up based on network bandwidth and witness nodes hardware.

You can also this with Bitshares. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:55:49
Maybe you should look at Bitshares. It is a chain designed for your audience.

If we could have a system where food is created at the moment it is needed for consumption, that would be ideal. We have an idea for it, The Food Replicators from Star Trek. That's the the ideal, but you if you believe POW is the only way, you would never reach that solution. That's why system like DPOS and others will have the advantage because they are not afraid of change and growth.

They just help with a transactions that didn't go through. The help desk service was fast and good. 
Thanks Emily!

Is there anywhere to pay for it with BTC? Kinda sucks if you can't. At least put it on streamium.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:26:03
The problem with BitReserve is that you are still trusting a third party to hold your funds. The government can shut them down or your money can be mismanaged.  That is why BITSHARES is a better option. Your money stored on the blockchain with 300% collateral and it gives yield.
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:44:29
I remember that hype.
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:19:42
How so? BitShares has been functioning for over 8 months now. The pegs have maintained during all this volatility.

That great breakdown of how a decentralize exchange works.

If ppl in bitcoin can't agree on something as simple as blocksize, How could/would ppl outside bitcoin agree that it is the only solution??? Bitcoin is going to have work in in a diverse money world. If it can't play well with others then it will die.

Still calling it BTSX, but overall a good article. It can be hard to explain Bitshares but this was a good start.

They could have converted it to BitUSD on Bitshares and maintained the value.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:31:22
Do you need the cash physically or just want get of btc? If the latter then bitusd may be an option to convert too for awhile to avoid the volatility. Instead of being an IOU from the exchange, it is a coin you move to your own wallet at will that retains the value of a dollar.

It takes awhile to grasp and explain.
