well bitstamp is a lot prettier than btc-e so there's that.

That looks horribly painful. Is there a story to that gif?

What was the method of payment?
If it was paypal, somewhere in the region of 70-80%. If it was bank transfer then very low.

Because it's interesting and related to bitcoin

This is relevant to my interests. Do you ship to the UK?

Just wanted to chime in on point 5 just so I know you're clear. You're right, after 2-4 years there is a very good chance bitcoins will have increased in value. Perhaps you'll be a millionaire. This is a genuine possibility and I think most people who have been on this ride for a while now would agree with me. Most of those people would also agree that in 2-4 years bitcoin could be worth substantially less, or even virtually nothing. Personally I think that's very unlikely but judging from the tone of your post *perhaps* not as unlikely as you realise. I obviously don't know you and maybe you do realise this. I just wanted to be clear that it would be deluded to dismiss the possibility, however slim, that in 2-4 years your investment could be worth almost nothing.
Your situation is interesting and I can certainly understand the motive for what you're planning to do. Perhaps I'd even do the same thing - just with the knowledge that it is somewhat a gamble rather than a sure fire method of keeping your money safe &amp; hidden for a couple of years whilst it multiplies in value astronomically. 
You make a good point about current banking systems as they are certainly not a sure thing either - not even in countries such as the UK. You give examples of first hand experiences with this so I totally understand why you consider this a potentially rational way forward. I consider it rational as well - even after considering the fact that bitcoin is a mysterious, infant and volatile store of value which is constantly at the mercy of market manipulation and having its growth stifled by a myriad of licenses and laws we've already seen start to crop up in various places.
Just make sure that going into this you have all the facts. €110,000 is far from being chump change but at the same time probably isn't so much that it would be a life changing and catastrophic loss. Again, I'm making assumptions about your personal situation.

Couple of reasons:
* the amount of damage you could do before everyone realises a 51% attack has occurred and ignores your blocks is limited, which leads me on to my next point...
* the amount of funds required in order to achieve this is somewhere in the hundreds of millions, and once you get to that stage you'd realise you've built a huge mining infrastructure and it would be far more profitable to just join in and mine than attempt to "kill bitcoin" and therefore demolish its value
The more you think about it the more you realise the incentive to carry out a 51% attack isn't really there. Especially when you consider the fact that in killing "bitcoin" you only kill bitcoin the currency, not bitcoin the network or bitcoin the protocol. And not cryptocurrencies in general. Bitcoin v2 would be launched the very next day and with it would come a large army of ever more passionate cryptocurrency evangelists.
credit goes to Andreas antonopoulos for saying basically what I just wrote above.

UK bank transfer is pretty good.. basically the only way you're going to have problems is if the bank account was stolen. Bank transfers are generally not reversible except in cases such as that.
