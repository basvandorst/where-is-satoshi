They demand freedom, except when that freedom can be used to hurt someone's feelings, make someone mad, or potentially allow someone to earn a profit from the work they do

How is this a feature of bitcoin? It was Expedia that processed the refund quickly. They could have just as easily waited a week to do the transaction. They could have just as easily refused to allow the cancellation and you've have absolutely no recourse. At least with a credit card, you can dispute the transaction and the credit card company will issue a charge-back to the retailer.

It's not sustainable and they're not claiming it is. PayPal pioneered this model of growth in the early 2000's. They got huge growth by paying $20 for new accounts ($10 to referrer, $10 to referee). Eventually they phased out the program.
They're doing ok today. Business students everywhere study this, it was pretty revolutionary at the time. The point of doing this is growth, not to earn a profit.

By the time we have the technology to mine asteroids and deliver the refined metal or ore to earth, we'll likely have quantum computers that can easily break the hashing algorithms used by bitcoin.
If you've been hoarding bitcoin and expecting it to be worth something 30-40 years from now, you might want to have a backup plan.

Probably zero because there's no such thing?

I'm not sure it's a great idea to base your business model that places limits on where you can spend your currency.
This reminds me of people who are into "green" investing, where they only buy stocks of environmentally-friendly or socially-conscious companies. Sure that's great if it helps you sleep at night, but purposely limiting your potential income isn't great for business.
