I have a BS in business. I know there are classes lol. But your use of terms being "trained" instead of educated, and being highly dangerous people paints an image of a neckbeard. No offense i just thought it was funny.

Why do i get the feeling from your above comment you are trained in the blade and like mountain dew.... 
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:24:03
Definitely clearer. I dont think it sounds prententious as training instantly makes me think of the grand hall at the marriot or worse holiday inn. Training can be anything and often subject to question. 
Educated implies formal classes and pro longed education. Not just a 2 day seminar for $100.

I tried. Both on windows and linux. Didnt work. Went thru every tutorial people sent me. Using the masterkey method and the seed with passphrase.
Kept trying over 30 times....

Have you heard of a printer? I have a hard copy and digital. You have no idea how qubes works.

Honestly running Cryptomater within mega is great. Or within dropbox for android.

I sent from samourai to samourai wallet. Apparently theres an obscure bug they know about but havent pushed a fix. They said they would push it later today but my funds are locked in samourai pool until it drops in 72 hours.
I have an important bill i needed to pay yesterday when i first tried a transaction. 
Now Im trying to access my funds in electrum as they said i could and still use them. But never used electrum and not sure if doing it right.

The second transaction i take as my fault. I shouldnt have trusted the devs that it was a "rare" issue. But banning me for trying to get support from their telegram raises issues. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:06:33


I guess thats subjective cause after i reported problems they blocked me. They could have done the same to other people.


Nope. I keep a photo of the words i took from a second device as my backup.

Theres no part that was dramatic in the begining. I posted about help with exporting the wallet and  started saying i was lying on reddit and they were responding which  was not. Unless he runs both  and  he would have known that account stopped replying to me without explanation. 
You can see when direct messages are read and the issues. I didnt even bring up the second issue. 
Nothing stops the fact that the funds are still not accessible at this time.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:46:46
Well the dev admitted he should have pushed it sooner. And we actually ended that part on ok terms. I then decided to try another transaction on another device. First one under 20 went thru ok. Second one over 1500 is same error. So its not that rare or obscure. I didnt even post anything about that second one to the group. Only the dev directly as an fyi.
Then they blocked me and removed me from the group. So reporting a bug and im removed. The dev  was upset i posted here yesterday. Within 5 mins of the post he was complaining about it. And my post was about finding help to import the wallet to electrum as  stopped responding when i messaged the fix he stated didnt work.

Too complicated for you? Im trying to access my funds. Samourai said I could still access it via electrum but isnt showing anything. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:24:35
It is fucked up. It was a bug he knew about earlier. If he had pushed the fix earlier it wouldnt be a problem. And its not that obscure if happened on two different devices and 3 days prior they had pushed an update. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:29:02
Lol nooo. But kept in an encrypted container. I make sure it wont be accessed and running qubes i think im good :)
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:28:45
Im not going to try the new version until my funds are dropped. Currently over 2k held up for 72 hours in their memepool. I dont want to keep freezing another 2k for 3 days given the current price situation and drops in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:03:10


This is what they stated in PM. It would give an undefined error when checking the transaction. 
More was stated in the main group where we were  arguing about my post here yesterday and they not responding or answering. But i got blocked from that group shortly after i texted the dev the small test transaction went thru and when i sent the second one on the other device had the same error. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:50:52
I understand your point. But Im not worried about the internet connection. Theres no network connected to the vault vm in qubes. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:12:36
No. Ive used btc for years. For electrum to read it theres a process. That website i linked is whats needed. I did that. But nothing is showing and support is now not answering. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:23:14
Well from an RPA and front end dev i wasnt yelling at anyone in beginning. Now i dont work with wallets or android but i can see their github and the fix now. And i can show the responses to  have always been on good terms. He even thanked me for reporting the bug. Its  that said i was lying and posting to reddit when unless he controls both accounts he wouldnt know anything about the conversations. Then he wants to go off that they dont provide support for importing to electrum and a simple answer from samouraiwallet that he didnt know what else to do i would have been ok with that.
This bug was replicatable on 2 devices within 24 hours and theyve known the issue. I find it hard to believe they dont have other issues or complaints they havent pushed yet. Your dealing with peoples money not a game or productivity software. 
For the record I have offered to pay and other ideas as additional income towards the wallet.
