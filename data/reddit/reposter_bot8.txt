Or they could just use dollars

Who was behind it?

You would get a bigger room and larger computer per the needs off a business while developments are made in parallel for the technology. No company would cripple themselves by not getting a bigger room and larger computer if there was a business need.

The fees are a significant concern. The technology has not kept up with adoption and is hindering it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:14:38
Yes and yes. Currency broker. You are taking this argument in the wrong direction. The fees were under a dollar a short while ago and are now $15, which is not competitive with other digital currencies. Follow that tend of explosive growth and the fees are ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:21:30
Bank transfers are free. Other digital currencies are next to free. $15000 average? So on chain transacting expected to only be large numbers? With explosive growth and 64x usage increase, what happens to your fee?

What makes you think it is ethical for you to share that with the entire internet?

He didn't create it as a scam. He isn't giving real bitcoiners the middle finger, he was giving the interviewer the middle finger. What is a real bitcoiner? I have no idea what is real in this sub because posts like this are idiotic.

Yes, bitcoin is far safer than the stock market. Interested in some snake oil?

Good to know the percentage drop in USD but I would think the real story is the percentage drop in Euro
@_date: 2017-03-29 05:40:46
Should look at lines of code as well.

I'm a Nigerian Prince. Give me your money. I have 10 million that can be unlocked if you give me your money. Then I can have both the 10 million and your money. I'm new at this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:40:03
What allows that to happen? I thought transaction fees already put the bitcoin asset out of reach of being a practical commodity for use in monetary exchange. It is not handling explosive growth well.
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:34:05
Hmm? If that is the case, I need to get a refund on some pills I've been taking. Good thing the snake oil keeps my skin clear.

Heavy upvotes and gold. Feels like someone is trying to encourage others to dump.
@_date: 2017-04-18 07:24:43
As exact as that?
@_date: 2017-04-18 06:06:20
Where exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:37:22
Are you using Windows?

Given his position, that can only be taken as an endorsement of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:38:14
need clarification on forks of coins.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:48:51
The dollars purchasing power barely changed. How can an obvious increase in value of bitcoin across everything result in it crushing dollars? Might just say bitcoin is crushing 'it'
This sub is a circle jerk about the price. Like rappers talking about all the money they are making. Where are the women though?
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:20:52
What about vice versa?

Not with a third party service with an api and each user uses an online wallet. Netflix could be an authorized puller.
@_date: 2016-10-17 23:55:44
You must be a troll. Very funny.
@_date: 2016-10-17 23:32:16
You don't need to put all your bitcoin in the service. You could even have the bitcoin on your phone and they make push notifications to  your phone. You could authorize transactions to netflix in advance for a certain amount per month or do it on a case by case basis. Keys are only on your device.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:24:14
Can you explain how to prove ownership of coins and why it was needed? Thanks much and congrats!
@_date: 2016-10-18 03:07:11
What do you do for a living?
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:07:20
Credit and debit are services.
Bitcoin is a currency. Just provide an equivalent service using the bitcoin currency. E.g you could configure netflix to be authorized for a certain amount each month.

Yeh, the bullet doesn't move towards people, people move towards bullets and drag the universe with them.
@_date: 2016-10-17 23:47:51
It is a pull by netflix via a service. Taking the bitcoin off the phone to miss a payment means no netflix service.

Where do you get 3% interest?
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:42:40
Can you share details on the circumstances of the copy paste changing? Were you using windows? What wallet? Are you using anti virus?

I have no sympathy for cameras that break the speed limit
