good enough for me with just the screen shot, it adds a picture to the title, no need to click and read 'words'

If pepsi itself were open source and the soda you made was a derivative OF pepsi itself this would be fine...
Bitcoin is NOT a corporation, its NOT a TM, it's.
I know you recognize your analogy was horrible, but all the things you mentioned are what actually make it 'fine' because its open source fork.
yes, if it was a coca cola vs pepsi type scenario, where it didn't share the same 'flavor ingrediants' and was based on a different ideology but competed in the same space as pepsi then sure you'd have a problem because it would be a foreign competition to a PRIVATE product (coca cola vs pepsi where 'coca cola' makes a 'new flavor' called pepsi soda with their logo.
**In this case however, its basically pepsi coming out and saying hey, we added lime to regular pepsi and now we call this pepsi lime... its got the same pepsi logo except its all green instead of blue and red.**

Uses a variation of the same name... NOT the same name.
Uses a variation of the same logo... NOT the same logo.
No one remotely familiar with crypto thinks bcash is "Bitcoin" and those who do think that, think ALL crypto is "Bitcoin" ... similar to people thinking tissue paper is Kleenex

exactly.... you're right. 
he totally nailed the lines... they are exactly the same. /s 
as i said, good for a backyard build, but not even close in reality, its got the 'broad strokes' of a lambo and thats it
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:23:05
much more less .....
this is like answer yes to a multiple choice question haha
(I understand english isn't probably your first language and I also understand what you were trying to say (that its much less than 500k) just thought it was funny)
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:19:49
still not smart.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:40:35
oh god no, the miners themselves are quite pricey, especially this many.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:51:34
? you're kidding right? I mean yea its pretty good for a backyard scrap build but the thing is twice as tall as it should be, the lines aren't even close to 'right'
@_date: 2019-03-26 05:27:36
EXACTTTTTTLY... do people really think the FDIC is going to help them get their BTC back??? FDIC doesn't give two shits about how much (in their minds) monopoly money you lost

i put $500 at 13,000 last year..... it's not pretty right now, but that's about all i could afford to loose, and it's pretty much happened. but maybe one day i'll wake up and have value again, who knows.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:14:31
I only put $500 in once lol so its a bit different for me as I can't really afford more right now.. but yes over time it'll average out and ride the wave
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:14:49
apparently yes.... it's too late, time for sleep.

today i learned the macroeconomics 8-ball thinks it costs more money than most countries have to DEVELOP a Tesla or iPhone...
the R&amp;D for such projects is quite affordable at a country level, i don't know why your making this assumption.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:15:24
except your not, this 8 ball is pretty dumb

they'll live a bare minimum lifestyle which is HORRIBLE for capitalism / free market society.
deflation means you spend $1 today but REALLY you threw away $5 tomorrow... and since prices of necessities will adjust then you are REALLY hurting yourself by spending.
They both need to work together... inflation currency is for transactions and deflation currency is for investment, there will always be a value to trade between the two currency and that is what you do when you need to spend, you transfer your deflation currency into inflation currency at the lost possible minute and then spend before the inflation currency 'goes bad' and looses too much value.

they also couldn't confiscate it from FIAT banks

the graph is already not lined up... thats only 2 years of BTC compared to 50+ years of gold..... but of course the 2 years of BTC is amplified and lines up with 2/3rd of the timeline for gold.... so basically this whole comparison is useless 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:59:50
this really is the logical solution
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:08:58
I'll just say I know 1st hand this is possible and that government agencies all have the appropriate solutions to do so, they just have to know relatively who they want to listen to... however this can be applied at scale so it doesn't have to be 1:1 listening either, it can be broad based.

well you get INSIDE of this one so 'security' ???
