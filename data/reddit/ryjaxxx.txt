Bitcoin is all about control. It is all on the person and how they utilize them. I myself, have one mine running at 60TH/s with my own hardware. The money that is made is dumped back into PETA GH/s shares currently. Since bitcoin has been dropping my payouts on our normal mine have been not so great. The 10TH/s that I have purchased over the last two weeks from PETA has closed the gap of income that I have been missing. 
All I can say is buy more shares from PETA now while BTC is low. PETA is a great place to store money and gain interest on that money.

How can you say that. I had money sitting in my wallet, making no interest while BTC drops down to 500 USD. I put the BTC into GH/s roughly bought at 0.0016 $1 to $0.87 a ghs. Total my shares costed me around 16 BTC which were just sitting loosing money while USD/BTC drops.
Over the last two weeks I have made about 0.10 to 0.14 daily and this is at a BTC low. So far I have made 1.68 BTC. I can now sell all my 10,000 PETA shares recouping what I already put in plus making an additional 0.68 BTC.
How is that not profitable? I will continue to buy shares with PETA as they do make me money.

Actually sir you are wrong. Im positive $200 when everyone else is down sitting on BTC.
Your numbers are fine but what you forget is the cost of BTC. At the time when I bought the GH/s, the 16BTC was worth around $10,400 (1BTC/$650). 16 BTC is now worth $7,800 a loss of $2600 in BTC alone.
Even with GH/s being down, this is temp and it wont stay below $1 for long. If it goes anywhere above $1.15 per GH/s, which it will, I will have made money the entire time while BTC gets back on track and then sell for a profit.
Either way you look at it. I couldnt pull my BTC out so I invested it and my numbers are not profitable due to the price of BTC but is keeping me stable as if I was still running 60TH mine alone without the cloud mining.
Yes, I will sell the shares eventually and purchase all hardware.

Agreed regarding cloud mining was always a loosing profit because the power cost to GHS ratio ridiculous compared to hardware mining. You can buy hardware now for around $0.80 GH/s but after monthly power it will be roughly $1.15 per GH/s (depending on the state this could be a low number).
At this time since BTC is low, cloud mining is more profitable in the short term but definitely not in the long term.
I just see it as a way to make extra cash right now while we are at a low. I would never do cloud mining normally but I have done the numbers compared to our hardware operation. Overall goal is to continue the hardware mine. 
Once BTC goes back up, cloud mining will be ridiculous again with their obnoxious prices but hey have fun making pennies when that happens.
