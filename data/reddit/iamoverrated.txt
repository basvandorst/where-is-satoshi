Well said! 
You might not like doge but it's what I have for tipping so have some D to hold you over while you rebuild your bitcoin stash.

I know several people who deal almost exclusively in bitcoin or and / or alternate crypto currencies. It's not that they don't have any fiat currency, it's more like they have enough laying around to help supply their basic needs (things they can't use crypto currencies for) and they choose to use bitcoin or &lt;insert altcoin here&gt; to save, barter, do business, etc.

So long  and thanks for all the fish. :-D

It very well may be.  I'm not arguing for the position, I was just trying to relate that it's not unheard of for someone to deal almost solely in crypto currencies or for someone to reject the notion of having a debit card / bank account. It's certainly not the norm or in any way common in most developed countries but there are people out there who distrust banks / governments / etc. so much that they try to limit their involvement in the financial system. 
Personally, I think it's unwise to hedge your bets on one single thing; I like the idea of diversification and trying to have several back up sources of investment.  I think it's a relatively new technology and is in it's infancy as far as the market is concerned.  I do feel it's something to watch and it has great potential; but for me, it's not something I'm comfortable throwing all my wealth and time in. It's a tool, like all currency; if bitcoin falters, similar technology will rise to take it's place.

So... iOS and OSX are obsolete? Freenas and ZFS? How about the PS4's new OS, that's BSD as well.

TIL buying houses with Bitcoin based mortgages might be difficult.  I would tip doge but I think its frowned upon here.

Maybe he doesn't trust banks;  maybe he wants to live off the financial grid; maybe he doesn't trust government run centralized currency; maybe he deals with cash and / or crypto currencies because his business isn't exactly seen as being legal by certain government run agencies; or possibly he's concerned with the security flaws in the whole debit/credit system.  There are quite a few reasons and only he would know.  It's not common, but it's definitely not unheard of for people not to have a debit card.

You sir are correct and I apologize for my ignorance.
