But forks can merge new features and bug fixes right? So how is it a major selling point?
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:40:49
The analogy only works if there were 500 Tor alternatives, all with varying degrees of speed/features/security. I would want Tor to stick to its original intent and I'd use alternative relay networks if I wanted new kind of relay network features.
With Bitcoin, I want to to stick to what it's been: a global virtual currency with low fees. If I want something where I have to pay a lot more just to know that it's backed by a different style of network, I'll use another virtual currency.

Why are you being dense? The intention was to have 21M coins initially. A 1mb block size limit was never talked about at first.


We've had monetary sovereignty, decentralization and censorship resistance while being under the limit, so if anything the data shows that a limit is not needed to have these things.
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:25:03


The 21m was set since the beginning. The block size limit was added later as an anti-spam measure. They're very different and you know it.

And the iPhone used to have 90% of the smartphone market. Things change, and so can the cryptocurrency market if Bitcoin becomes a high-fee low-throughput currency.
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:21:31


That won't be the case when people are moving away from Bitcoin en masse to a more usable cryptocurrency that has both lightning networks AND faster and cheaper transactions.

Liquidity has been trending up across the board with various exchanges offering easy access into cryptocurrencies. Volatility is also a function of time. Bitcoin has seen crazy volatile days as well and we haven't seen the last of them, *especially* if Bitcoin becomes less useful than other currencies.
@_date: 2015-12-21 04:57:37
That's not the only requirement. Liberation and decentralization are also important. The most important thing bitcoin decentralizes is who holds the funds, though. With bitcoin, you can now be your own bank and that's what truly makes it liberating.

Would you prefer if they mined larger blocks?
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:30:56
I would argue that if it is peer-to-peer and trustless but not censorship resistant, it is not very useful. PayPal can handle p2p payments for me with very minimal trust. If they screw me over I can sue them, so not much of my trust is required.
Censorship resistance, though, is not found anywhere else online but in Bitcoin. And because Decentralization gives you CR, as you said, keeping the network decentralized is of utmost importance. That is why any block size increase at this point is questionable, because it imposes more resource consumption on all the nodes participating in the network.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:29:38
So you're saying that if you were actually defrauding the buyer, PayPal would have protected them, right? But that once you proved the allegations were lies, PayPal correctly let the payment through?
What's the problem here? Sounds like customer protection at work?
Look, Bitcoin makes fraud easier because it's irreversible, I get that. But it also allows you to make payments no other instrument can, such as donating to organizations like WikiLeaks or funding a revolution when the powers that be do not want you to do such things. That's censorship resistance at work (enabled by decentralization).
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:40:43
Not really. I use PayPal and Venmo a lot and they just work. I don't have to wait or pay fees either... What weird things are you talking about?
And if you really want to nitpick, we can say Bitcoin is p2Miner2p. "p2p" by itself is not really valuable, unless it cuts costs (PayPal) or enables things like censorship resistance (Bitcoin)... and that's my whole point.

Why are you assuming demand? Most people don't care about Bitcoin (let's be real)
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:34:17
Halvening means a deceleration of new BTC supply. What if the deceleration of demand is greater?
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:27:18
Dollars are also censorship resistant for my kind of spending (buying just legal things) and the supply limit doesn't mean anything if demand is dropping along with the supply... so for me there's nothing new about this kind of receipt.

This is false AFAIK. If the economic majority decides that EB=1 is what Bitcoin is, then miners will effectively be mining an altcoin with more hashrate if they start creating larger blocks. This would basically result in the same thing a UASF would if miners don't follow the UASF.
You're not forced to accept the block size that the miners set, not today NOR if they're running with BU. Again, BU is just a protocol for dealing with on-chain blocksize voting, and it can be configured to behave like Core.
EDIT: Yes, I am actually saying that you can support Core's roadmap and still run Bitcoin Unlimited. Not sure why you'd do that, but *technically* you could.
@_date: 2017-04-12 03:33:49
Isn't BU just about the voting mechanism? Like if the network wants 1mb blocks and votes that way, even if all the nodes were BU, that's what the block size would be. Someone correct me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:41:06
You're right I was off by 0.8% on some of those numbers, that's my bad. Good thing it has no effect on my analysis: you're misrepresenting the facts. None of those answers support your hypothesis that the users wanting larger blocks represent a "tiny minority".


This is un-verifiable and does not help with the discussion.
@_date: 2017-04-21 19:18:30
Challenge accepted. Name me 10 people in the technical community that support small blocks and I'll find you 10 people in the technical community that support large blocks. :)
@_date: 2017-04-12 04:46:33
Right, but that's the case now too I think. If 75% of the miners all got on the phone and decided the next morning that they'd run a client that produces 2mb blocks, they could do that. All the exchanges would stay on the minority fork and economically it wouldn't make financial sense for the miners to do it -- but they *could*. I think with BU, it's the same thing, but instead of a phone call to other miners and exchanges, it's a tag on the coinbase transaction.
I'm not advocating for BU, just trying to clarify what Bitclub's position is. I think you can be for the voting mechanism that BU released, but not for larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:37:27


sorry but the link you provided may contradict your statement... ~50% voted yes to a non-segwit blocksize increase (versus ~40% that voted "no"). Furthermore, 50% were "big-blockers" versus 34% who were "small-blockers".
I think you're alluding to the Bitcoin Unlimited question, though, and in that case you're right that only 23% voted "yes" to "4. Do you want miners to activate Bitcoin Unlimited?". However, that is not a "tiny minority" so you're being disingenuous here (a quarter of users is a "tiny" minority? Really?). Secondly, it is not clear exactly what "activate Bitcoin Unlimited" means. Are they against miners voting for block size changes or are they against people running the BU client? Or something else?
Overall, it is clear that people want a non-segwit blocksize increase. And it is not a tiny minority as you seem to want people to believe.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:47:28
on the soft fork side there is also Extension Blocks. Then for hard fork proposals there is FlexTrans.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:24:37
You're pulling numbers out of thin air just like Greg is. Most of the engineers I know that used to be in the Bitcoin space left it because they were large-blockers and were treated like enemies or incompetent for having a technical disagreement.
I'm not going to claim that there is a ratio favoring large blocks OR small blocks, because the ratio of people I hang around with is obviously different than the ratio in the groups you hang around with.
We *can* talk about facts (eg. hashrate or this survey published by 21), though, if you're willing to have a scientific discussion...
@_date: 2017-04-24 08:09:50
That's us invalidating votes.
You're arguing on the semantics of "vote", which is strange, given that my point was not about the meaning of "vote" at all... it's that people who want bigger blocks don't necessarily want the miners to run a Bitcoin Unlimited client. I mean can we even say that they run Core? Don't they all run custom mining software to maximize ASIC efficiency?
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:18:52
"mine yourself" is not the only way to vote with your stake, you can also invest in mining companies or in their cloud mining contracts. Proof of work is not exactly 1 cpu 1 vote... you can vote by giving your money to a miner and saying "I'll invest as long as our votes are aligned".
I'm not advocating it but there are also people funding DDoS attacks, which is another way to vote with your stake.
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:19:02
Or just modify your hosts file...
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:54:27
That's the beauty of voting for bigger blocks, it's a protocol vote not a vote for which client you should run :)
@_date: 2017-04-24 06:24:19
Proof of work is a voting mechanism. Miners vote for which chain is the main chain by mining on top of it.
Secondly, coinbase-string voting is a way to publicly announce intent (vote for) a protocol change proposal.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:01:27
Fuck. So pumped. Keep up the good work :)

Bandwidth, RAM, disk space. I pay to be a Bitcoin user and don't want corporations to decide that I should be paying more.
and before you say "well it'll make the fees cheaper", well the cheapest fees are on Visa, not Bitcoin Cash. If I wanted a cheap and fast payment system I'd just use Visa. But I want a decentralized and permissionless payment system. I want digital censorship resistant payments. And from what I can tell, that ain't free.
The block size limit is what allows me, a nobody, to run a Bitcoin node and validate that the centralized miners are doing their job and following the rules. If nobodies couldn't do that, then miners are free to do whatever they want and we lose control. We lose the "decentralized" in "decentralized ledger".

I've switched to Brave on my laptops a month ago and haven't looked back, so I can answer this:
Firefox feels slow and clunky compared to Chromium. The parallelism and isolation Chromium provides for each tab makes it much more reliable.
And the reason I don't simply switch to Chrome then is because I trust Brave with my privacy much more than I do Google. So in a sense I'm getting the best of both worlds, the browsing privacy I'd expect when using Firefox with the performance of Chrome.
Plus I get to support the Bitcoin economy while browsing. The only downsides I've seen so far are that this is an in-development browser so it crashes sometimes, and secondly the group-of-tabs UI is annoying.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:37:18


Sorry what are you talking about? Most large-block proposals come with limits on transaction size (eg. capping transactions at 1mb).
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:44:40
Agreed! Voting with bitcoin keys might get us to closer to seeing what the "economic majority" actually wants compared to a Twitter poll
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:41:49
I know, that was my point :)
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:40:58
agreed, so now we'll not only have large block limits tested, but segwit as well. The more tested proposals the better!
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:02:47
Correction: In order to work properly, it needs a *malleability fix*. There have been a few proposals out there. SegWit is currently the most popular malleability fix proposal, but it is not popular enough to activate (requires 95% of the hashrate).
Ideally we can come up with a mealleability fix that has more consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:49:23


You're conflating a "block size limit" with a "block size". Blocks don't fill up any limit you give it. It took 8 years to fill up 1mb.
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:16:56
Can we get a lot of coins to vote for SegWit? Or do we not have as much coins on our side?

Nothing wrong with supporting both core devs and a bigger block size proposal. We're all in this together and we shouldn't let technical disagreements get personal.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:33:34
assuming this is cold storage, the private key is probably split using Shamir Secret Sharing. That way you can use a simple UTXO and still get the benefit of M-of-N signing.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:23:15
Decentralization says nothing about power. It's a technical detail. And "decentralize everything" only sounds good to techies in the space. Censorship resistance says something about power: it says you can broadcast information and anyone can consume it, and no one has the power stop you.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:29:58
it's a downside you can mitigate (do the share combining in a cleanroom, offline, wipe the memory after use, etc.). Another advantage of SSS is if ever you want to change the M-of-N configuration, you can combine and re-run SSS, whereas multisig would require new UTXOs. You'd have to move your cold storage funds (billions of dollars for Coinbase) every time a key is lost or compromised.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:13:20
I disagree. It should be "censorship resistance first" instead of "decentralized first". What we want is a censorship resistant Bitcoin. For that, we need fully validating clients. For that, we need decentralization.
Decentralization by itself is not really a value, the censorship resistance is.
