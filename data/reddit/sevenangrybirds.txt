What begins as an alarming headline ends as a dithering, indecisive conclusion.

Shouldn't we expect far less of a bump in price from this halving event?
The first halving in 2012 slowed the remaining supply of 50% of all BTC, and the 2017 halving will constrain only 22% of all BTC.  It's not like all 16 million Bitcoin already in people's addresses will double in value just because the remaining 5 million Bitcoin are mined slower.

Are we sure the author is comparing apples to apples?
I'd be more inclined to value Bitcoin using transaction growth rates that correspond to periods of low price volatility (implying the market has deemed the price fair during those periods).

Funny how the 'Bitcoin is Dead' article titles are having to grow more subtle, now that the media outlets are aware that we're tallying them up :)

Is hashrate generally a leading or lagging indicator of price?
@_date: 2016-06-10 23:20:16
Agreed-- halving is *beyond* priced in.  I've been tracking a metric, addresses created per day : price (since addrs/day is the fundamental measure of activity on the Bitcoin network that is most strongly correlated to price movements at about r^2 =0.92), that's stood at about 0.000108 for the past year.
This recent price increase has seen the metric shoot up to about 0.00014.  That's the highest it's been since the bubble of 2013-2014-- somewhat worrying.

Honest question here-- isn't it standard practice that for-profit companies often pay salaries to open-source developers?  Take Intel, ARM, Nvidia, etc with the Linux developers.

Even taking my losses on bad loans into account, I've made a 13.83% return on my investment through Bitcoin-denominated p2p lending in the past 4 months.  I've also started to withdraw my principal + interest lately and have had no issue doing so.
Just presenting the other side of some users' experience.
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:35:10
Agreed- diversification is key to making a return.  I've made over 100 loans spread across 3.575 BTC and while a decent number of borrowers have clearly run with the money, those who pay back (especially those who pay early) allow me to offset those losses.
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:07:01
Strongly disagree.  Transactions per second is one metric for the power of the Bitcoin network, not the virtues and morals of its users.
I can think of many use-cases beyond BTC-as-digital-gold; one being IoT-style microtransactions between connected devices.  How does being "trained to spend instead of saving" factor into tx/sec in this instance?
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:44:25
Here are a few of my criteria:
* When a return or APR is too good to be true (over 60%), it is.  Legitimate borrowers could have gotten a bank loan or some other credit refinancing otherwise and not need to come to Bitcoin.
* Income verification is more important than identity verification.  I don't know why that is, but I see a strong correlation between bad borrowers with no income verified.
* Diversify, diversify, diversify.  Small loans (0.05BTC max) only
* Maybe I'll break the above rule if a borrower has repeatedly paid back my loans early or on time
* Check that the borrower is not suddenly asking for a huge increase in funds, ie if they have a short loan history of 1 or 2 BTC then suddenly ask for 50 BTC
* Generally do not invest in a borrower with 0 history
Hope that helps

2 year lurker here, very interested in this idea and had to leave some feedback.
First of all, you really seem to be onto something.  I notice, however, that you've received very little attention for this, mainly due to the way it's presented.  Your kickstarter video and descriptions read more like a tutorial than a business pitch, so your idea is going right over the heads of 99% of viewers.  I would imagine it's hard for people to see the vision of your technology, much less how they're going to make a return off investing in you.
As an engineer myself, I know that it's tough to explain the value of innovative technologies to non-technically-minded people, so here are some business-oriented questions you must answer in order to find more success with fundraising:
-Who is your target market?  I know you said "the list is endless," but give me ONE SPECIFIC example of where this could make an impact if it were on the market TODAY.  The intent here is not just to provide an example of where your idea COULD work, but to show us a plan for where your idea WILL work, ASAP.  That's much more compelling and easier to wrap my mind around.
-When will you start making enough money to pay back the 30,000GBP investment needed to develop your product?  Software and technology get developed all the time for the sake of just developing-- prove to us that your idea isn't just a 'solution looking for a problem' by showing a defensible timeline for when customers will start flocking to you.
-Is Bitcoin widely used enough for this to be an effective anticounterfeiting tool?  How many businesses even accept Bitcoin, much less use them as their primary record for transactions/inventory/etc?  I am a hardcore believer that Bitcoin will be used for all these things in the future, but not within 5 years-- and as the saying goes in the startup world, 'being too early is the same as being wrong.'  Perhaps finding a small-scale supply chain that has already embraced Bitcoin or other cryptos will go a long way toward answering my first question.
-Building off that last one, how will you grow beyond the initial target market to start serving companies who maybe aren't sold on the whole Bitcoin thing?  I'm of the opinion that BTC will gain the most widespread adoption when people don't even know they're using it.  Everyone's already too busy taking care of their problems-- paying rent, finding a parking spot, passing that next exam.  Nobody is going to take the time to learn about XPubKeys and BIP32 in order to check whether that pair of shoes in the store is authentic.  But if you find a way to push all of that to the background with a compelling, simple app (or enterprise software, etc), the floodgates will open.
All that said, I'm happy to give you more feedback and wish you luck in this.  Once you've got an actionable business plan together, I recommend you re-list on Kickstarter, or better yet, on some crypto crowdfunding / lending community, like BitLendingClub or BTCJam.  Anyone else know of other good fundraising platforms / websites?
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:55:44
Hey derrend, we exchanged a few messages 7 months back when you first posted the cryptoproof concept.  Glad to see you're still at it, keep up the good work and fight the good fight.
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:57:36
Fully agreed.  And compound those problems with open issues like whether to change PoS to PoW (or some other form of yet-to-be-invented PoS), the gas-to-computer-operations exchange rate, etc.  
I think Ethereum is one of the coolest projects in one of the blockchain space, but the only reason ETH as a token exists was to crowdfund development.  That's not a good enough reason for me to risk my investment getting decimated while all these continuing issues get worked out.
@_date: 2016-05-21 01:24:01
Because inefficiencies in Bitcoin's source code like signature verification (which are currently being improved by developers) make block transmission times increase polynomially relative to linear increases in block size.  This is harmful to the Bitcoin network, whose main benefit over legacy electronic cash systems (like Paypal or Swift) is its decentralization, because it damages the profitability of mining operations.
If block transmission times increase by even a few percent,  over time miners' profits will drop because they will inevitably sometimes spend electricity and funds on soon-to-be-orphaned blocks.  In such a thin-margin business as Bitcoin mining, that may be enough to push small pools out of business and leave only the largest ~5 players remaining.
In order for Satoshi Nakamoto's envisioned consensus algorithm to work optimally, we want to see as many Bitcoin mining pools (preferably individuals) operating as possible.  And until we can be confident that most other performance bottlenecks in Bitcoin's source code do not exist, we run the substantial risk of damaging the network by swapping out one arbitrary block size limit for another.
*Edit:* Actually, my response is only even for *changing* the block size limit.  If you totally removed the limit, wouldn't miners just try to validate longer and longer blocks to invalidate any blocks found by their competitors in the same time window?  Of course the market would find a time-window-length equilibrium, but that market is made up of only the top handful of mining pools with the best internet connection speeds (minimizing the risk of working on soon-to-be-orphaned blocks).  Still sub-optimal.
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:39:51
Also true.  Interestingly though, price movements are very tightly correlated to transactions/day and addresses_created/day (although the magnitude of those movements isn't correlated).

Sounds like it-- contrary to what the haters say, the point isn't to make money directly from mining.  The role mining/Bitcoin play is just to tokenize other resources like CPU, memory, etc to 'rent' out to developers.
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:39:05
Ok, then let me provide some feedback that clearly BTCJam wouldn't pay for shills to spread on Reddit.
Their AutoInvest feature is not helpful in my opinion-- after letting it run for a couple weeks, I found that the borrower default rate was MUCH higher than those I picked by hand.  I turned off that function pretty soon thereafter and that's when the majority of my returns started flowing in.
Clearly, there are scammers on BTCJam's site, some of whom have run with my money.  The platform has some work to do in terms of improving their credit rating system and policing obviously fraudulent borrowers as well, but I believe this site and p2p lending in general are doing a tremendous good for expanding the userbase for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-21 01:40:59
Funny you should bring up medication.  There's regulation in that industry (look up DSCSA, FMD if you're interested) that requires every package of pills, medical devices, etc, to include a unique serial number and product history of when/where it's been in order to guarantee authenticity.
There are a lot of people in this space who are trying to develop cost-effective anti-counterfeiting solutions, myself included (don't worry, I'm not going to steal your idea haha).  You may want to do some research on track-and-trace in general to see what lessons you can learn and apply uniquely using Bitcoin in your tech/business.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:45:32
My pleasure.  A few more thoughts for you at this point:


I'm glad you took the time to walk us through the back-end functionality, as it shows you've really got something more than just vaporware, but Kickstarter (or fundraising in general) is not the place to share a tutorial unless it's follow-up to someone specifically requesting to see it.  Consider some brief video clips of you using a non-functional prototype app on your cell phone as you 'scan' a 3D printed object in your other hand.


You definitely will want to check out 3D Hubs if you haven't already.  They're a 3D printer matchmaking service that already accepts Bitcoin...perhaps see what companies like them, Authentise, and others, are looking at in the anti-counterfeiting space.  I'm sure they already, or soon will, recognize it's a major issue that is not cost-effectively solved by any existing technologies.


Asking people to do this would be like asking them to mine a cryptocurrency with no block rewards.  Your idea has two directions it could go in from here; it will be either a hobby that remains your personal development project to perhaps serve as prop on your resume (nothing at all wrong with that), or it will become a business that gets adopted by the 3D printing industry perhaps as **the standard** in anti-counterfeiting technology.


Ah, the paradox of starting up...
Perhaps a way to break the vicious cycle is to offer some perks to your early adopters/funders at little-to-no cost to yourself.  Maybe 1000 free cryptoproof keys once you launch?  Maybe you make a CAD model for a 3D-printable key fob for a Trezor or something and distribute to your funders, complete with their own cryptoproof keys?  Or a shoutout in your videos / website (like Platinum sponsor, Gold sponsor, Silver sponsor, according to how much money they donate)?  Or a colored coin whose value is somehow tied to the success of your development?
I know having to spend time on things like perks or the financial side may seem like a distraction, less pure, and less-real-work than actually getting down and coding, but that's how the world works and it's how you break the paradox of starting up.


Good point, thanks for the clarification.
Again, I am keenly interested in seeing you develop this not only into a fully-functional software, but into a real kickass business.  If you do some crypto-related funding after refining your pitch, I will totally throw some coin at you.  Hit me up for any questions and I will be more than happy to help you think this through.
The ball is now in your court.
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:57:52
Would be cool to see someone write a script that automatically 'stamps' a 3D printed model with a QR-coded bitcoin address or public ID by extruding the code into a CAD model to prove authenticity.
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:03:17


You're right that quantum dots are overblown.  The main advantage of a data-only-based solution such as yours (a QR code that can get imprinted directly into the CAD model's surface before printing, I assume) over quantum dots or crystals is that it requires no separate, proprietary material to work.  If someone wants to protect their 3D printed parts with quantum dots, they'll have to go out of their way to buy a printer specially outfitted with quantum dot printing capabilities (or buy the separate, expensive ink canister or whatever)...that's unlikely to happen, even on an industrial scale, especially if solutions such as yours are on the market.
I also forgot to mention the Autodesk Spark Fund...it's a $100,000,000 investment fund targeted specifically toward startups who are fixing problems in the 3DP space.  Perhaps a good group to target your future business pitch toward.
Best of luck on the app development.  Message me when you've got something you want me to look at.
