For this exact reason: Ripple happens.

Really? Didnt knew that. As a matter of fact i dont even know what voluntarism is but i get the idea out of context, more or less.
But there are -isms popping out every day for pretty much anything. Thats a fact.

English is not my first language. To put it otherwise: Those people who follow a trend and mindlessly buy into something without understanding neither what it is that they're buying into, nor the associated risks, deserve to get fucked.

Yup. He pretty much rounded it up. ^^

Good read but i think you're just being paranoid. Its very, very unlikely that bitcoin should fail anytime soon and even more so that failure being a total loss (meaning that it wont get replaced.). It's a well diversified coin that makes it almost impossible to coordinate an orchestrated dump. If the dump is unintentional and lasting then somewhere, something must have gone really really wrong in which case Bitcoin should be the least of our problems.
I think there should be plenty of time and numerous indicators that a crash is imminent. That should be even more obvious when it's about gradual replacement of the coin.
Really i just cant see a way where bitcoin fails and we dont have a shitload of time to pull out.
Unless you're one of those people that throws their money into something and remember to check up on their investment once every couple of years. In that case, thank you for being my cushion!

Your poor brother... Im sure all the starving african children would feel for his loss...
Seriously though, im sorry for your loss but ANY person who considers killing himself over something *they didn't even worked for*, that just pretty much fell on their plate, is a stupid and most of all selfish motherfucker in my book. People lose children, parents, their whole god damn live's work and don't resort to that.

This wild swing made me extremelly happy today! In my head it meant that i've got more time to accumulate than i previously thought! ^^

I've read only halfway through your essay because, frankly, i didn't care to read the rest. You're not saying anything new or irregular. Not caring about the tech and getting in only for the $$ gainz is one thing and is completely respected. Not doing any homework and expecting gainz without any effort whatsoever is an insult to everyone else who's spending hours and hours over this and you deserve to get fucked because you're a fucking idiot.
Third person refference is for ease of writing, nothing personal.

Is this a requirement to work on such positions? I mean, this is a special kind of stupid i thought that it was some kind of tradition in my country to have that combination more often than not but i noticed other countries followed suit. Don't you have anything better to do than steal other people's traditions?

Salty as fuck when i see people just biting into what they're served without even questioning fundamentals as such as **what the fuck is that what im throwing my money into** and things like that.

Jesus, they have an -ism for everything nowdays, don't they?

It's a network that enables banks to have a common currency, in order to reduce the time and fees it takes with the SWIFT system. It also can be produced by the network at any time so the "owner" can inflate and deflate it's price at will. I've seen many things i didn't like about it but i guess this tech is free to be used by anyone, isn't it?

I've learnt more lessons looking at numbers for the past 20 hours than in a whole year of reading about it but not actually investing in it.

Enormous factor, yes. I will be slaughtering a sheep in the name of Fortuna this evening.
On a side note, i bought back in at 1,5k. Found a little nugget of information that gave me some insight that *maybe* it was a hicup, to put it planly, (certain actions of a Korean exchange. Trying to find the article again.) and not really a dump. If it turns out true, more profits. If not, still profits! ^^

To my understanding it was a difficulty adjustment, something that occured again numerous times with BCH, no? It didn't actually split into anything.
About low fees: You are right but the current situation has it that BCH and BTC compete between them and a replacement of them both is way beyond the horizon so a comparison to other alts is currently irrelevant. Plenty of time to improve and work out problems on both coins, assuming that this is the objective on both.

I think the decision to kiss my sleep goodbye and wake up every two hours tonight was the best decision i've made lately...

Sold my BCC at $2.250 a few hours ago and a few minutes later the dump happened.

You seem to understand how ponzi schemes work. Smart people can make a profit out of ponzi schemes too, especially so early in the game. Now you are either dumb or your prospects of profit are greater fighting the Bitcoin rather than fighting for Bitcoin.
I believe it's the latter. Dumb people don't do homework.

I believe it has less to do with timing than situational awareness. I mean, it has reached a level where so many people got involved that you only have to stay informed, know a few things about crowd psychology and how economics work (which i don't by the way but still i try to keep myself informed) and even if this whole thing goes up in smoke, i'll still be able to make some profit.
It's you im competing at the end of the day, not a bank or a government. I just have to sell before you do, when it goes down.
As for the Bitcoin itself: Besides the fact that it became an idea and ideas are not easily forgotten nor given up, It's just a naturally occuring evolution to currencies. From coins to paper, from paper to digital. Nothing more.

I tried various accelarator services but none works. It seems that since the transaction is already a couple days old, it's been dropped from their mempools but on the other hand on other block explorers it's still up. So im in a kind of transaction limbo here. -.-

Seems nice! As far as i understand Andreas Antonopoulos has some really insightful videos and interviews about the matter.
