not really.  I had to contact the parent company, or whomever, I forget the name of it, and they interacted for me.  The end result was that my bank was not being added at that time to their (already) VERY minimal list.  So, I left it go at that.

hi, I'm new to bitcoin and created a Circle account last night, bought in a small amount, converted to BTC and sent it to my own wallet and the transaction time was instantaneous.  It was completely seamless.

Yeah, I tried Circle out also.  Did two very small deposits within a few days of each other. Lightning quick transactions.  Boy was I impressed.  Then, yesterday tried to do another small deposit.  The held it pending for account review, then rejected it (I did have the funds).  Now they're reviewing my account for the next 3-5 days.  What is it with these exchanges.  They seem to be no different than banks, or fiat wallet companies (i.e. PayPal).  I avoided Coinbase due to the excessive complaints about them here on this forum.  I attempted to finalize my banking information in Glidera; they did not have my bank on file, nor was their search for bank function operational.  Still waiting on a reply from them.  Seems like the exchange environment is NOT populist oriented.  And the protections (hoops) one has to go through to conduct transactions are in total contravention to what Bitcoin is about.  I don't know...I'm frustrated I guess.  I want to buy and hodl, as it is referred to here, but, cripes, one can't buy what they want, when they want.

Just a suggestion:  Try a Copay wallet (you hold the keys) and then when you want to cash out, send through Circle then to your bank.  When it came to Circle (as opposed to Coinbase, and I'm still waiting on Airbitz/Glidera to resolve an issue), Circle was seamless and instantaneous.  A lot of us newbies and even the vets here are bitching about Coinbase.  I chose not to even consider them based on that.  Thanks for letting me put my two "bits" in.

They just got back to me.  I was impressed that it was so soon.  I'm not hot about it, but my frustration stated above, and experience so far with the others, well I hope would be understandable.  We as a consumer have to be able to acquire some semblance of faith in these mechanisms in order for the economics of the environment to take root.  That's the point I'm trying to present.  
In any event, the jury is still out.  But, I don't feel as though I was walking a plank in front of the sword tip any longer.  Thanks for your post.  cs

that's right! also:  "Don't Believe the Hype."  I was a fortunate noob.  I did my due diligence and bypassed Coinbase completely.  I started with Circle and only buy in small increments, then put the BTC right into Poloniex and watch it go up and down, or I buy XMR with it in a pairing.  Good Luck to you, and again, you are right:  The reason is now FUCK THEM!

somebody should help the FBI shut down Coinbase
