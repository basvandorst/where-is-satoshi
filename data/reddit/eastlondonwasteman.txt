I would be happy with about 30% in Bitcoin. That's enough investment to bring back a solid return when the price hits 50-100k.
And the rest would go somewhere less volatile, probably property.

Considering how many retailers accept Bitcoin it would be hard to argue that it's not a currency. Equally when compared to traditionally currency it's hard to argue that it's on par with traditional currencies. Ultimately Bitcoin and crypto are so vastly different to what we have known until now so the definitions are blurred.
The problem with Bitcoin being a currency is the transaction fee's and speed of network are likely to hinder it being used for day to day stuff like buying coffee.
But for example it might still be useful if you were buying a car, or putting a deposit on a mortgage.

Lets imagine I am running an exchange and imagine that only 50% of withdrawals of FIAT actually process.
All of a sudden the BTC price halves against the global average because anyone selling and withdrawing has to essentially withdraw 2BTC in order to get 1BTC.
Localised supply/demand within exchanges can drive up/down the price relative to the global average. We saw the same thing when MtGox was failing.

Big traders are doing this already. You need to be relatively bitcoin and cash liquid across many exchanges and currencies.

It's really not. It just larger block sizes which isn't a sustainable method of scaling. The only use is a method of extracting money from fools, so if you are quick with your trades sure.
There are better coins to invest in than BCH if you are looking for actual future utility.

It's a different mechanism but the point is there is still a cost, it's just built into the system rather accounted per transaction.

Absolutely. Hard forks are an expression of will and are ultimately democratic. However in todays world we have to be hyper vigilant against people with bad motives. 
Just look at what happened to America. They voted in Trump and 99% of people with a brain can tell you it's a fucking horrendous idea. Exactly how it happened nobody truly understands but we do know for certain that subterfuge was a component to control the media narratives and build a vocal support base who were ultimately misled into believing lies.

One the exchanges start selling off I expect it to fall massively. I've told all my BTC holding friends to get out ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:12:38
Because it limits a short term attack with hashing power.
Imagine if someone had a super computer which was many orders of magnitude faster than the entire bitcoin network. If they switched it on and caused the difficulty to skyrocket and then turned it off, everyone would be stuck with an extreme difficulty which could takes a very long time to recover from.
I think this becomes less important important as the network grows larger and the power needed to create such an upset gets bigger and bigger.
But imagine back in 2011 if someone had a top secret ASIC miner and could effectively stop bitcoin simply by turning it on, totally obliterating everyone in the network and causing the difficulty to blow up.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:49:17
IOTA requires the node to confirm transactions before you can send. So the fee is actually built into the CPU/Network/Time cost of running the node.

Realistically I don't see the world needing 4 "top cryptos" in the next 5-10 years.
Maybe two at most as a store of value, the rest will end up being utility type chains which in my opinion would not be a good investment at this stage. I lean towards about 10-15% holding in ETH as I think that's the second most promising crypto which has a lot of investment into it with the rest going into BTC.
I don't really see mining as a particularly worthwhile investment at this stage, far too many people down the chain eating into your potential earnings and the biggest problem is the hardware is dominated by a single dodgy chinese manufacturer. If the Japanese develop new ASIC's in 2018 it could be an interesting time to get into mining.
Day trading is fine if you've got the time to sit around doing it and have the capability to do so. However that size holding is at risk in an exchange. I personally don't have more than 10% in any one exchange.
The simplest idea if you truly believe in the utility of Bitcoin is a simple purchase and long term hold.

@_date: 2017-11-15 10:25:16


That's exactly my point.
That's why i said  4 "top cryptos" and then followed up with saying "the rest will end up being utility type chains which in my opinion would not be a good investment at this stage."
There are hundreds of new cryptos right now all vying for a small piece of what's left of the market share. Trying to find value in that mess right now is very difficult and a HUGE gamble. Of course there will be winners, there may be some coin down in 400th place that turns out to have huge value in the crypto space but we don't know how long that will take to emerge.


In my opinion splitting investments 4 ways into the top 4 crypto right now is too risky and more likely to diversify your losses.

People estimate that Satoshi could have over a million BTC. At _todays_ price that's over 7 billion USD. If we imagine that Bitcoin could one day reach 100,000 usd then that would represent 100 billion USD.
That is a HUGE amount of power for any one individual to have over Bitcoin and that will definitely create a huge amount of uncertainty.
And when I say problem it doesn't necessarily mean bad things will happen... It could be navigated in a positive way but we don't know. That's the problem, the uncertainty.

The problem I see with ASIC manufacturers is that they are highly incentivised to mine their machines instead of selling them Which is exactly what has happened with every ASIC company ever.
They manufacturer the units.... sell them.... and then mine for as long as they can to drag out the delivery process to make profit on the sale + the mining.
I'd love to be proven wrong that there is an ASIC manufacturer who is willing to develop and produce ASICS and not actually use their customers like that.... but I think it's extremely unlikely.

These are things that many institutions don't want to do. They want to focus on their core business, not hoping they can build out internal capability because it's difficult and easy to fuck up.
Coinbase might not be the most ideal but we will likely see more and more companies offering to protect and secure Bitcoin for companies who don't want the hassle of dealing with it.

I wouldn't normally be so harsh but you are spreading FUD when you tell people that an S9 is making over £1k month.

I agree with you, the systems around Bitcoin need to improve but the problem is they are dealing with the traditional banking system which is desperately against Bitcoin.
My transfer to Bitstamp is still ongoing after 4 days. It's a joke honestly. I was ready to buy in at the dip and had a large chunk of cash to go.
Once Bitcoin gains legitimacy I hope that the banks pull their head out of their arse and stop trying to stifle innovation.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:50:55
Watch this: 
The TL;DR is that to reach the kind of levels of payment processing which we need for Bitcoin would require incredibly huge block sizes which is simply unsustainable in the long term.
So yeah we could increase the blocksize now and it would have a marginal improvement but we would quickly need to increase it further.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:20:26
Because companies don't understand how to secure their Bitcoin yet that and most companies outsource large chunks of their business to others anyway. I work in the finance industry and you would be amazed at how much of what a bank does is actually managed by others.

This is true however in my experience most open source forks tend to be very clear about the fact it's a fork and will try their best not to confuse the end user. BCH seems more like an attempted hostile takeover than anything else.


This fight for what is bitcoin is harmful to the entire crypto ecosystem. Why BCH people are desperately trying to legitimise their coin as "bitcoin" everyone else is suffering. And what happens when someone forks BCH and then starts the struggle again? This is one of the biggest risks for the uptake of crypto currencies, the perceived instability of the entire ecosystem due to constant power struggles for what is the REAL bitcoin.
I don't know what the solution is but the way the BCH team are going about things is probably not the right way.
