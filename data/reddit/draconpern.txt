Do you mean credit card statement or bank transfers?  It's kind of hard to have a charge on a bank account.

gourl has a 1.5% fee.

You'll have better luck with the economics department.

Something also to note. Paypal isn't that popular in Japan either, and they have been around longer than bitcoin. It's hard to beat those IC cards.  Also, they work even when they are in the wallet, I don't think bitcoin has that feature...

That's true.  I have to say though, when I was in Japan, everyone just took out cash (we chipped in for food).  I didn't see a lot of IOU going around.  Also, there's plenty of ATM's to get cash because they are in 7-11 or family mart.
So besides bank transfers, it's also possible to transfer money using the post office.  For goods, cash on delivery seems to be some what used.

1% in fees?

Same as ads.

I think the idea is that it automatically pays the moment you visit...  Which is not really the best idea.

Negative interest rate is just another form of QE. Now when the bank borrows money, they are given even more money than what they asked.

get a cheap 2U dell on ebay?

Doesn't even makes sense since bitcoin isn't a commodity.  It should be pretty easy for someone to argue that bitcoins don't come from the ground..

Lol.. Registered in Montana with one of those shell registration places.  Did you know that you can supply fake registration information and they don't even check?  My non-legal name was used once for registration at a similar kind of place in NV w/o me knowing it.  I got a copy of the documentation, and obv, there was no signature, or really any way of knowing if the name is even real.

Sounds like a CSRF attack. When you used that login on that site, it captured your session.  Then when you gave them your wallet address, they were able to attack.   This means they may have found a bug in the online wallet that you are using.
