Clearly to lure in the fish but keep the winning regs out. Clever girl...

Experienced this with UBER in Manila earlier this year. Took Uber taxi maybe ~20-30 times, and none of them tried any scams.
Taxi microscams otherwise are a daily occurance in South East Asia, some examples I have to deal with every day in bkk:
-Driver "forgets" to start the meter and demands a nice rounded up number at the end.
-Giving a large banknote - "sorry no change :D", even though 10min ago he was counting his tips.
-Deliberately taking customers to a wrong location, to get commission for each passenger (like for example shitty night clubs).
 
-Accelerated//tempered meter. 
Even if a person has enough experience/knowledge to avoid getting scammed, it's still a major pain in the ass to go through this whole conversation where you try to convince a driver that you're not a fish and you're not gonna get scammed every time you take a cab from airport to the city.

The whistleblower?

Towards the end he says that subversion can be deflected in the early stages with Religion. He went as far as to say it's the only way.  In bitcoin's case, does that mean keeping  faith and hodling?

How long until we get to squint at ignorant peasants and say "what do you mean, you are NOT all-in on bitcoin!?"
