The address is cryptographically derived from the private key. It is a one way function. You can't derive the private key from the address. You need the private key to sign, or validate a transaction that involves that particular address.

Another way to look at it is like running a tab at a bar. The lightning network is the tab. When you settle up at the end of the night the on chain (cash) transaction is made. One difference though is that lightning channels can be open for long time periods.

Yes. It will generate a seed for you, or you can restore a seed that you already have.

This is the same as the ledger though. If you don't know how it is supposed to be initialized "out of the box" you may fall for any scam packaging.

This is exactly right. The scammers are selling genuine (but compromised) ledgers and then trying to steal any coin transferred to them. If the buyer had been for-armed with knowledge they could have reinitialized the device with no loss. They paid a fair price and got a quality device. The scammers make all their profit from the few that don't do due diligence.

They CAN have a history but they don't because nobody records them. So they are fungible even though unique. The exceptions are police sting operations. Bitcoin is not fungible because the history of every coin can be traced back to its origin.

I guess that's why criminals prefer used 20s with non-sequencial serial numbers.

Ledger are committed to open source but NDA prevents the code for the secure element from being published. All the applications are open source.

You should ask your question in the Ledgerwallet sub. Someone from Ledger may be able to answer you directly.

You may find your answer here:

I don't think so. All wallet functions are handled by open source software, and that software only passes a transaction to the secure element to be signed. The secure element is not allowed to interact with the outside world.

Nice work! The tinfoil will tend to keep the heat in. If the box was flat black it would be better.

I didn't think of that. Safety first!

And can you buy it with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:59:37
Come to Canada, epicenter of Bitcoin ATM adoption. Maybe because so many of our stone age banks don't allow fiat payments to exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:49:17
I like how the exchange rate is plainly visible. A lot of machine operators obscure the rate and/or service fees etc.
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:56:29
I have never exchanged for cash, but definitely some (but not all) will sell BTC with no verification, and that is why some people use them. Some machines need pin confirmation by text, which is a side channel breach of anonymity.
