I assumed the most fair way to do it was to act like margin trades never happened. So whatever your wallet balance was at the time of the hack is what you will eventually get back. Nobody profits, but nobody loses. 
First pay of USD customers since BTC was hacked. Spread what BTC is left compared to what was stolen. So if they have 30% remaining, each user can withdraw 30% of their funds. As repayment occurs by fee profits on BFX, they can allow more withdrawals spread across all users evenly by % until everyone is whole.
The only ones to complain are ones that were in the positive P/L on their positions, but why complain when you at least get all of your money back?
Before allowing any trading or deposits, fix the flaw. Guarantee that all new deposits will be able to be withdrawn and not go to other customers who had deposits there when the hack happened. This would generate more trading and more fees, if people trust them from now on.

Go read the CFTC papers and also remember that the two of biggest users with funds on Bitfinex were staff members. These people work together, so everything from funding to trading is done by a few "friends". They control everything!
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:10:48
I'm never getting all my money back. I've written it off. I'm also willing to write of whatever money it takes to burn Bitfinex to the ground one way or another. Im willing to spend up to half of the money I have made off of BTC in the last 4 years to do. Satisfaction is worth more to me than money in the bank.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:33:42
There were far more longs open than shorts, so they are killing off a majority of their customers.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:29:36
Good to know.
@_date: 2016-08-24 05:34:37
I didn't say they were buying their own tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-23 23:44:28
But what about all the people suing? Like myself? I would rather them shut down and go to jail then get my money back. I lost more on them closing my positions than the hacker stole, so I will never get all my money back. At least I'll be happy knowing they are all in jail because they are a bunch of amateur crooks.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:41:13
Can someone explain how this works? I have bitcoins backing my margin long. It is in the red due to the sell off. Now my position closes and the "ghost" bitcoin is sold to who? These "ghost" bitcoins are sold for cash to repay loans. But where is this cash coming from? 
Not only does the margin "ghost" bitcoin need to be sold to close the position but my collateral "ghost" coins need to be sold to repay the lender. 
Wouldn't closing all positions cause more problems?

If you don't believe in whales controlling the market then you haven't been in this space long enough.
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:05:31
I didn't say I did this and lost. I am willing to bet I've made more of trading than you over the years and I don't even know or care who you are. I'm saying from a business run by amateurs this is the best scenario for them, to take from the not so good traders.
@_date: 2016-08-24 05:35:00
Why would I buy the tokens when I believe they will only go down in value?
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:08:40
I am not sure what you are trying to say. 
What I know is that there are more longs than shorts. What I think, in fiat terms, there are more longs in the negative than shorts in the positive. Close them all out and there is a negative balance. To me, what you mean by "they" as in BFX "are taking a loss NOT to kill off their customers" is incorrect, because there is a negative balance now and BFX will have a greater loss to deal with. Or were you trying to say now that more customers have a loss, they have to repay customers less, benefiting BFX?
Being that more longs are being closed out in a negative P/L than shorts closing out in a negative P/L, a majority of users just lost even more money.
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:56:45
Will you take 10,000 BFX tokens as payment?
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:38:07
How can you sell bitcoins on bitfinex if there are no bitcoins to sell?
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:12:08
So if I file for bankruptcy I will get my 21 BTC back?
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:08:46
Even if they don't manipulate they can have people lose out and lose BFX tokens, and BFX tokens as fees. Every BFX token they receive as fees is less BFX they need to raise capital to pay users back. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:28:38
It should be an ICO with a price floor of $1
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:11:58
Also, by enabling BFX as margin, Bitfinex gets to collect BFX as fees. So that is less BFX they have to buy back.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:46:17
I'd die trying to find the hacker before committing suicide. If Bitfinex handles this poorly, I'll just add them to my list as well. Just like Arya Stark.... 
Hacker, Jean-Louis, Giancarlo, Phil, Raphael, Mr. Tang... Hacker, Jean-Louis, Giancarlo, Phil, Raphael, Mr. Tang... 
Did I forget anybody? I'll leave Zane out of this because he came on after they used the shitty Bitcoinica code, lied to him, and is doing a great job communicating with the public.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:24:40
Its not a leap in logic. You and BitGo said it wasn't their fault. It wasn't the users' fault of course. So that leaves only Bitfinex at fault. Pretty simple logic there. 
Here is some more logic, if I don't get my funds back I am coming for all of you.
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:13:44
That's a great idea. They is a zero percent chance they buy back all the BFX at $1. Too many people are suing, including myself. They will be shutdown fairly soon.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:16:52
According to their new announcement this is what they are doing.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:34:04
Then how was it stolen out of multisig bitgo wallets? Also if margins are closed at a loss wouldn't you be responsible for the losses since it is not at all possible for it to be the customers fault?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:11:09
I didn't think he was implying you guys did it, just that it's your fault. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:06:51
If the loss of BTC was 36% wouldn't each BFX be manually set at .63BTC? Then when Bitfinex raises money they should manually raise the BFX/BTC rate until it is 1:1. Users should be able to trade in at any time or trade on another exchange for whatever price.
What is the point of giving me a token that represents what I lost only to let the Bitfinex market decide how much each token is worth? In the end I want Bitfinex to repay me every BTC that was stolen, or else I'm coming after them.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:04:38
Those people who were not hacked should not be able to withdraw unless Bitfinex makes everyone whole, correct? Because what I read in the other thread was that it would open them up to lawsuits because of different class groups.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:42:32
I swore I saw that Zane said that you didn't have to sign up, that all users where switched over to BitGo. I never signed up at BitGo and my coins were all in a 3xxxxxx address. Maybe some users were never switched because their coins never moved, for others once they moved out of a wallet, it was switched over to a BitGo address?
@_date: 2016-08-23 23:36:59
They are adding this so they can move the market against you and take your BFX collateral. This way they have to pay back far less than expected from the hack. Their own employees trade on the exchange, 2 of the top traders are employees, and the CFTC documents show that 80% of trade volume was from a few companies. These people want your BFX tokens at these low prices, so why not let you use them as collateral and then "steal" them from you by margin calls?
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:25:04
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:06:38
This is why users should set up a second password for sending of coins in addition to 2FA for logging in. If someone did manage to email and get 2FA they still wouldn't be able to send coins from the wallet. Blockchain.info should not be giving out second passwords.

What happens if I am selling and the buyer says they sent the fiat but they never do, does the signed transaction that we both entered into break and all funds returned after a certain time? As in I never sign the return transaction because I never received the funds. Who is the middle man in this case?

@_date: 2014-11-28 19:41:46
Second passwords are not entered through a keyboard. A touch keyboard shows up on the screen so the hacker would have to do a lot more work to record the screen than just entry level malware like key loggers.

They are plenty of banks where you don't have to prove where the funds came from. He is already very rich so who is going to question him if he isn't in trouble? If they can't trace the coins through a mixer they can't prove he stole them, so he will ever be jailed for it. He will be free to spend that money. Unless they have emails or something else that proves it.

Manipulation of price at Stamp has been going on since we hit 680, somebody wants to delay the rise for some reason. They are probably trying to keep the price low on Stamp while they buy off market. When they are done, we should naturally move up with less resistance.

The asks seem to pile up, then they dump, then they replenish, repeat, and we go down more. Im not firing until I see the asks not getting replenished, which means they may be out of coins to sale.

If it was someone else that had access to those coins at Gox, Mark would know who it was by now. Do you think he is willing to hide that evidence from the police? I doubt it. The only reason nobody has been thrown under the bus by now is because nobody is Mark's boss , and therefore either doesn't know or isn't willing to say. This is an inside the company heist and more times than not the CEO is behind it.

The only problem here is using Coinbase in the first place.
I've never had a problem with Circle. Coinbase probably alerted your bank for no reason, and now your bank is keeping you from linking the account.
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:51:33
It's obvious Mark stole them. He has been using a mixer, which explains the high transaction rate ever since, and then sells them on other exchanges, which explains the constant sell pressure. All this has been going on since they were stolen, and with no regard to the price. He knows it's only a matter of time before they find out so he might as well sell them all while he has the chance.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:39:25
Number of new coins mined daily is the same.... no more, no LESS EITHER.
Blocks will be found on average of every 10 minutes no matter the difficulty or price. 
When the difficulty INCREASES, your CHANCES of solving a block DECREASES, not the amount of time between blocks getting longer. 
When the difficulty DECREASES, your CHANCES of solving a block INCREASES, not the amount of time between blocks getting shorter.

These dumps do not even phase me anymore. I am an uber bull, and I am loving being able to increase my stack of coins as the prices go down. The only thing that will phase me is if something actually goes wrong with bitcoin. The protocol is still intact last time I checked, and thats all that really matters.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:56:21
He has complete access and can see every login into the system, which is what the police are looking into! He is the damn admin of all admins on his system, he can see who moved every single coin on his exchange and when and where. You sound like you are Mark himself!

All they are going to find is that most customers have a net loss. So if they are going to do all the work for those customers, and those customers claim a loss on taxes, then so be it.
They will spend more money investigating than they will receive. I guarantee it. (unless they only go after profitable whales)

If someone is selling say, .01BTC at 48.621, you will see that sell of .01BTC at 48.621 followed by whatever is next, that matching engine of exchanges match your USD to BTC and buys up the sell column. So you might see half small transaction and the other half might be big walls set up, where it will buy chunks at a time. If you look on clarkmoody, you can somewhat tell if its one person or not, but how close are the transaction are. They started flying when this person started buying from what I saw.
@_date: 2013-02-24 02:08:53
BitInstant uses Coinapult to send your bitcoins to your wallet or to your email address. If Coinapult is down, which happens occasionally, the only options they will give you is to put USD directly in your Mt. Gox account where you can then buy bitcoins, or VirWox and VouchX.
Blockchain will say it is down, because again, they use coinapult to send to a specific address. Once Coinapult is back up and running, BitInstant will add the other options back. If this IS the problem...

Long story short, the backup you made stores 100 private keys. If you create a new address within that same client (up to 100 of them), the private key to that address was backed up. Bitcoin QT knows which address you will get next when you create it, and the private key to that address (again up to 100 of them). So when you restore your backup, it will synchronize with the network, and know that the addresses from your backup belong in your wallet. One backup is all you need, and the network will update you wallet accordingly, and all your bitcoins should show up.

That would work as well, but only if it is a major credit card company that could go after you with collectors if you did not settle your debt. The only downfall would be is if you spent money early in the month, then the price of bitcoin drops, you would end up owing way more than you spent. With an instant exchange like I proposed, you would know better than to spend or not.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:37:07

I may be wrong, but I think I read somewhere, that the first major bitcoin theft occurred around that time.  When I tried to find that article again, I was unsuccessful.
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:45:38
I don't see the CREDIT card working to well. I want a DEBIT card, to where I send some BTC to an address specified by the debit card company, and it shows my balance in USD given the current BTC price. When I use my debit card, it only allows transactions within my balance, and the company sells enough bitcoin to cover my transaction plus an X% fee. As BTC price increases, my USD balance increases. At any time I can send more BTC to my debit card address.  
Is this how BitInstant plans on doing it? I guess for this to work you would need to partner up with processor, which would charge fees on top of that.

What kind of trick do you speak of? This person obviously wants bitcoin, dumping a mill on it at this time for a pump and dump would be stupid, there is so much resistance between 48 and 50. At BEST he will bring it to 50 and then it'll drop to 48 at WORST. What is to gain in that?
