Every year hodlers of last resort increase. This exponential growth of hodlers is what pushes us closer to hyperbitcoinization. Plan accordingly. Buy bitcoin. Hodl.

This sounds good until were in a bullrun and we move from 10k to 20k in 3 weeks and you still haven't bought. DCA is the only tried and true method

The biggest thing is to make sure your bitcoin is controlled by you. Make sure your 24 word seed is safe and that you have a solid passphrase attached to it, then wait. I don't think you'll regret this decision. I actually think this will be one of the best decisions in your life when you look back on it.

If you put ISIS  bitcoins through a mixer a few times it's impossible to track and will be worth as much as any other bitcoin. In the future privacy implementations will mask all transactions. ISIS bitcoins will be bought and sold on coinbase without anyone being able to stop it

As someone who recently overcame an addiction to buying bitcoin I'll say this; the best and easiest way to stop is to understand that once you own 1-5btc you WILL be set for life after hyperbitcoinization. If you don't currently own more than 1BTC I would make that the most important thing in my life. Once you grasp how rare 1btc actually is it helps you stop buying and put your money to other things you need, paying off debt or whatever else you may need

There are no such things as "lightning tokens". The lightning network uses Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:08:14
True I definitely think there needs to be more severe repercussions for officers when they break the rules. Obviously if they kill someone unjustly they need to be sent to prison. It's just extremely hard to find guilt because cops are in incredibly stressful situations every day, they could be killed any time they're on duty. It's extremely for us to judge from the couch when our life isn't in danger

If you're running a miner you should be running a full node as well. If you're not mining you can still run a full node to help secure the network. We almost have a million subscribers on this sub, if we can get 5% to run a full node we will make a massive difference and help secure the network substantially

@_date: 2018-09-22 00:13:44
The author sounds like a child accusing the core developers of malicious intent based off the way that they reported the bug. 
The bug info was getting leaked one way or another and the majority of nodes were not upgrading fast enough. 
The devs decided that it was extremely time sensitive so they decided to release how serious the bug was with the public in hopes that it would trigger more people to upgrade their node...it worked. 
The Author is blaming the devs with the way they released the news because it could have hurt the altcoin that he is developing on, he fails to see the bigger picture and makes himself looked extremely small minded.

There is no such thing as lightning network tokens, who on earth told you that and why did you believe them? 
The lightning network uses real Bitcoin sent to real Bitcoin addresses.
I understand the point you're trying to make in that the lighting network will make Bitcoin far easier to use but your analogy is terrible and extremely confusing for newcomers. It makes the lighting network sound like an altcoin.

While I agree with you on your view on christianity, I don't on the police system, there are a few bad cops out there but the majority which I'd say is about 99% of cops are good people who actually want to help people.

Coinbase only reports to the IRS when you cash out 20k or more in a calendar year. This could be changed in the future though. But right now if you cash out $19,999 the IRS won't get notified. It will simply be on you to report it to uncle sam like the good citizen you are.

You currently are only seeing the negative aspects of mining for example, while right now mining is consuming an enormous amount of electricity, you can view that as bad, or look at the potential future positives such as using the heat as a way to heat your house.

Because that's what people like you do, they make 10 predictions and 1 actually is accurate they delete the 9 incorrect ones so they look smart. The only thing is that no one thinks you're smart

@_date: 2018-08-07 12:36:45
True, but crypto is so risky that you could be hodling a massive shitcoin that's tanking, you should be selling but you convince yourself that the price is being manipulated down so a whale can accumulate, problem is it's not and it's just a tanking shitcoin. That's how people commit suicide 
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:16:33
I see your point but I don't want my memory to fail me and for me to lose my funds. The only way for someone to steal your coins is for them to break into your house and physically take them or make you transfer them. As long as you don't tell anyone that you own crypto I'd think that those odds are pretty low
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:22:27
Nah you're not that important to anyone, I'm just making sure other readers see an alternative opinion to your clearly biased one. I doubt they would be fooled by your ignorance but I'm just making sure you get exposed for what you are, and that's a 15k salty Bitcoin buyer ������

Exactly, this could be a ploy by a big investor or investors that want to buy in low. It's exactly what the big guys did during the .com era.l, they convinced everyone during the bear market that all the stocks were worthless and then they bought massive amounts of them when everyone was panic selling, I wouldn't be surprised if they're doing the exact same thing right now

Yeah I agree I've heard alot of people have problems with trezor too. I agree if ledger opens up everything to be open sourced then I don't think I'll ever switch.

@_date: 2018-08-09 05:22:11
This is so absolutely true it's crazy, the more expensive it is to mine one bitcoin let's say it raises to 10,000 fiat to mine one, then that becomes the floor for Bitcoin. Once you understand that most miners would rather hodl then sell below that price it gives you the undeniable bitcoin bottom.

Find out if it's a global fraud? These 12 year olds clearly know nothing about Bitcoin

Hashrate is in a monstrous bullrun. I equate the hashrate rising to people and companies understanding the value of Bitcoin and the future of the decentralized network. Price doesn't matter it's manipulated and the fast majority of Bitcoins are traded OTC and aren't recorded by exchanges. Price is meaningless, hashrate is what we should we valuing.

I completely agree with you, however I think that the bigger it becomes that the first step that countries and governments might take is to ban mining. Obviously people will still do it like in Venezuela. 
Eventually I think every country will inevitably be forced into Bitcoin in the long run. 
We can see that Venezuela is imploding, their economy has been destroyed and that's why people are turning to Bitcoin. The fact that the government is shutting people down is extremely alarming

Orphaned transactions but that's not considered that a double spend. If you have 1 bitcoin you can't send it to 2 people, you can only send it to one. It may show up under pending transactions in my wallet and then disappear but that doesn't mean you have double spent a bitcoin, you still only have one bitcoin to spend

I have a question and a funny observation; 
What country does everyone think will he the first to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency? Venezuela or Turkey perhaps? Maybe Switzerland?
Also just imagine all the moonboys who are planning on selling when the next bullrun starts, they'll go from being extremely well set up for the future with Bitcoin to then selling for fiat which will eventually die. They will be back to being poor hodling dump trucks full of worthless paper. Hodl. Buy Bitcoin.

I agree with you about Bitcoin eventually because the global standard. However the prices of Gold have been steadily falling since the beginning of this year. You also have to consider that if you're planning to buy gold to hedge against this you also have to consider that the US could seize all the gold from its citizens like it did in the past. Maybe people realize and will go straight to Bitcoin because it's unseizable

History rhymes so it wouldn't surprise me if they tried that, especially if Bitcoin becomes the new Gold and every country is accumulating like a madman. If the US government didn't get in ahead of the rush it would be no surprise to see them attempt to try and confiscate all or a certain percentage of everyone's bitcoin.

It's not, Bitmain has no incentive to attack it, and even if it did and succeeded bitcoin would hard fork and every honest miner and node would change to the correct fork, leaving bitmain and whatever dishonest nodes to continue mining the hacked chain, which would be completely worthless. All this could happen in about 1-2 days. Bitmain would destroy everything they worked for, all the asics would be worthless too
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:22:55
If we're right about bitcoin I doubt any of this will matter.
Bitcoin is the fiat killer. When a fiat currency tanks people buy a stronger currency like the Dollar or they buy Gold. If all fiat currencies start to massively inflate and become worthless Bakkt will have to pay out in "physical" Bitcoin.
Let's say in 5 years the USD starts to tank, in 6 months it's lost half of its value. The Government starts pumping dollars into the economy but it doesn't help. 
Do you think Institutional investors who are hodling their Bitcoin with bakkt will accept a payout in rapidly inflating USD? Of course they won't, especially if Bitcoin is skyrocketing due to all the inflation. They will demand their Bitcoin sent to them because they won't want any other form of currency.
I think even if fractional reserve Bitcoin banking happens it's only a matter of time until that problem fixes itself. Institutional investors are going to get hosed because there will probably be 10 paper bitcoins to every real one that's being held by bakkt. Which means that 1 in every 10th investor will actually get their money. 
Or bakkt will just declare bankruptcy and keep it all. Who knows, just hodl your own keys and of course Buy Bitcoin.

I converted my btrash for the real Bitcoin a long time ago. I wonder what logical reason that bcashers have for staying with that coin when almost everyone is pulling out of the bitmain IPO. Bitmain controls almost all of the entire hashrate for bcash, it's probably the most centralized coin for that reason. Isn't it like 16 wallets hold like 60% of all the coins? How is that reasonable considering its probably roger ver and Jihan wu? Those guys are serial scammers. Once bitmain tries to salvage its company by dumping bcash and starting to mine Bitcoin again, bcash will tank to $50. Why would anyone in their right mind continue to hold onto it?

If you can't weather a extreme storm/bear market for a few years then that is a clear indication that you have invested more than you can lose.

False, a ETF has to be 100% backed up by the asset. While reports on ETF's for other assets could easily be manipulated that's impossible with bitcoin because you can verify how much Bitcoin is being held by an address at anytime and by anyone. It's impossible to fudge a report on the amount of bitcoin you have in your wallet because anyone in the would could throw their address into a blockchain explorer and see the amount they are actually hodling. I absolutely agree that Bitcoin doesn't need a ETF but it is an extremely easy on ramp for the big guys.

November 30th 2013 Bitcoin was around $1100, after that date and until early 2017 Bitcoin was below $1000. 3 years until the price recovered back to 1k. The fact isn't that Bitcoin is up the past year, the fact is that Bitcoin has always recovered after a crash. I believe because it is the soundest form of money known to man. I advise you to study economics and more specifically read "the bitcoin standard" book.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:10:24
This is the truest post I've read here. If you understand the big institutional players this is exactly what they did during the .com era, they convinced the average person that they had been scammed and that they should probably sell cheap so they don't lose all their money. Then while all the little guys were selling their stock during the bear market guess who was buying it? Yup the big guys, and we all know what happened after that, prices soared because now the big guys were invested. You can bet the house that as soon as the price is low enough and all the big guys have filled their bags that an ETF will be approved and the next run will happen. Don't fall Into their hands they're trying to play each and every one of us right now. Hodl. Buy Bitcoin.

Some big players need a big dump, so they told the SEC to review the denial decision thereby hoping to create false hope in the Bitcoin community. 
They want us to think that is has a chance to be approved, it doesn't have a chance at all though. 
Once they sense the fomo is building they will tell the SEC to deny it again and hope that the market responds by selling and having the price drop. 
They're trying extremely hard to manipulating the market. Don't fall for it. We don't need an ETF, we never have and never will. Hodl. Buy Bitcoin.

Your opinion isn't logical, if that situation happened, as soon as the first country dumped the coins the price would initially drop, but all the other countries that want the most solid form of money ever created to back up their economy would buy it as fast as it became available. One country dumping wouldn't make Bitcoin any less of a reserve currency. It would simply destroy the country that dumped it. It would be the stupidest thing a country could possibly do

It wont matter if they can regulate it or not, eventually banks and governments will be forced to use it.

It starts as a store of value, the same 51% of the world have access to Gold just like they do Bitcoin. The other 49% if your statics are correct are excluded from both.

Its because all the bot buys on alts are tied to the bitcoin price, so if bitcoin spikes 3 percent then the bots on all the exchanges automatically start buying alts. The same goes for when bitcoin drops all the bots start selling as soon as bitcoin loses a couple percent. Of course there are exceptions, huge news or a mainnet release will incentivize people to manually buy a coin and that's why some days tron spikes

"I thought that cryptocurrencies would be the one and only breakthrough for ordinary hard-working people like us," she said. "I thought my family and I could escape hardship and live more comfortably but it turned out to be the other way around."

The Lightning Network is a "second layer" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain (most commonly Bitcoin). It enables instant transactions between participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of digital cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds and minimizing trust of third parties.

Question; what if the entire supply of bitcoin gets bought by longterm holders and there is no more to buy on exchanges besides the couple coins here and there that people cash out. The only coins that would be available to buy would be massive over the counter trades and also all the coins from the big mining giants. This would drain the supply and the price would skyrocket overnight. Please poke holes in my theory 
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:02:35

I've thought about that exact thing recently. I absolutely hate trusting the company but it's the best we have as far as security today so what can you really do about it? Even if the company did collude how long would it take for them to drain everyone's wallets before the news got out? I assume they would hit the biggest wallets with thousands of Bitcoin and then try to escape. They would be headed for a life on the run trying to escape law enforcement and private assassins the rest of their lives. I'm definitely keeping my eyes open for a better storage option but I haven't found one yet. The new coldcard wallet looks cool but its unproven as it hasn't been released yet

In my opinion bitcoin is saved energy. If you work 45 hours a week how do you save the energy that you put into job? You get paid in dollars or whatever fiat currency you use but after living expenses how do you save? If you save in dollars then inflation will rob you blind. Gold is a good option but Bitcoin is unrivaled. We have a known supply that cannot be altered and cannot be taken away from you. My answer is saved energy.

This is an event organized by Trace Mayer. Essentially if you don't hold the keys to your Bitcoin it's not yours, you simply have an IOU from the exchange. However if you withdraw your coins it forces the exchange to give you your bitcoin thereby proving that the exchange actually has the bitcoin reserves to pay you.

This guy gets it. They're clearly accumulating Bitcoin OTC. If you think they would buy from an exchange and tip everyone off while making the price skyrocket then you're a fool. They're all working together and accumulating as much as then possibly can. Once they're all ready they will simultaneously release news saying, we have the future currency, come and buy if from us.

Also Bitcoin will be theoretically extremely expensive and the transaction fee on the first later will be extremely high, we obviously will be using the 2nd layer at least aka the lighting network. We won't pay the huge fees for the first layer but they will definitely be sufficient for the miners.
@_date: 2018-10-29 03:22:26

Nah I don't value your opinion, you seem like you pretend to understand everything, but in reality you're just clinging to something so that you can talk out of your ass. The truth is that no one knows what would happen to Bitcoin during a recession. It's an entirely new asset and it's never went through anything like that before. So your guess is no better than anyone else's

Hands down the most ignorant article I've read all year. 
The most likely scenario is that the governments and the people controlling them just massively underestimate Bitcoins potential.
The first point is pure ignorance, with the lighting network Bitcoin can definitely handle enough transactions.

Based off your comment history you lost 39 grand in bitcoin off a coinbase fuckup, you also thought we were going to the moon on June 6th.

The difference is that when the everyday investor puts 5% of his portfolio into bitcoin as a hedge the massive crashes may cease to exist.

No one is going to tell you how much they have
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:38:15
The reality is that no one knows the future, you think we'll never see 20k again while the next guy thinks 1MILLION is likely in the short term. Neither guy knows, it's all guess based off your opinion of the world and what's happening in it. 
When I look at the world around me I see an enormous need for an asset that can be sent anywhere in the world, at anytime, for any reason, for extremely low fees. Not to mention being uncensorable. Bitcoin is UNCENSORABLE, some people don't understand that no one can take your bitcoin away from you or stop you from using it whenever you want to. Literally no one, not the president, not China and their communist regime, no one. I see a massive need for that in the future. If you don't however then go ahead and sell or do whatever it is you want to do with your bitcoin.
I've seen so many short sighted opinions like yours everywhere when the price goes down a couple thousand. People get so wrapped up in the short term that they forget about the long term. They forget about how much the world is in debt to each other because everyone just keeps printing money to futher their country's economy. It's unsustainable whether you see it or not.
The most beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that it doesn't care what anyone thinks. It doesn't care about the fanboys surrounding it making it look like a pyramid scheme. It doesn't care about the meme culture surrounding it. It doesn't care about your opinion or mine. Bitcoin simply keeps working producing blocks every 10 minutes regardless of what anyone thinks. 
Bitcoin doesn't care.

Good luck, I'll tell you right now it won't work. Let's say you sell at 100k which is the easy part, odds are you're going to FOMO back in aroused 200k-500k you now only own .4BTC. Bitcoin drops from 800k down too 600k in a day and you panic sell hoping to recoup some of your losses. It jumps to 1,000,000 in 4 days, and you buy back in. You now own .25BTC. Then comes the drop, we drop from 1 mil to 500k overnight, you hold because you think we'll bounce...we don't. Over the next year we drop to 200k. You only have .25BTC and now the IRS sends you a letter saying that you owe them 200k in capital gains tax. You sell all your bitcoin to pay the IRS and now you're right back to where you are right now. Dead broke.

Yeah see that's what I keep thinking about, total interest I'll have to pay in the course of the next 1-5 years.

He's talking about Bitcoin the decentralized network, eventually you will choose what country or state you want to live in and pay taxes to due to Bitcoin. Eventually states and countries will try to convince you to live there by offering you services like free healthcare or free college if you pay taxes to them, remember you would choose to live somewhere and pay taxes based off what you would get in return, not because you'll go to jail if you don't pay like it is now. That is one possible implementation.

The system would work infinitely better than it does now. The roads and public infrastructure are included in the tax, so is police officers wages and the fire department wages. If you don't want fire department services then you don't get a response when your house is on fire. I would assume police officer security is a mandatory tax that you agree too when you move to the state.

I've read a lot of comments here about still being taxed once we're on the Bitcoin standard, this is true   everyone will still pay taxes...however what changes is that countries won't be able to force you to pay them taxes.
You will chose what country or state you want to live in and pay taxes too based off the services that are provided to you by the taxes that you pay. 
Take America for example, imagine if Kansas offered you one year free tuition for every 4 years you paid state taxes, that would incentivize a lot of people to move there in order to take advantage of that offer. Imagine if Nebraska offered free medical coverage up too 25,000 dollars if you lived there and paid them state taxes. You have to use your imagination and realize that once the world has switched to a sound money everything becomes possible.
Obviously the ramifications are much higher on a country level but it still applies. No more pointless wars that lines the pockets of the .001%.
No more reckless government spending on things that don't directly affect the population living inside their country.
We will still pay taxes but we will get to decide to what state or country we pay them too based off what we see our taxes going too. Remember the blockchain is immutable, once a government has a budget any single person can verify every single transaction that happens during a fiscal year.
Imagine the world we can create with sound money.

@_date: 2019-06-11 16:16:33
Well if all the bitcoin was evenly distributed to everyone in the world then the average person would have 3,000,000 sats. So if you have more than that you're going to be above average
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:38:45
What's funny is you didn't correct me in my guess about your situation, so I assume it's true that you FOMOed in at 20k and let someone else buy it for you at 40k. Now I'm wondering if you actually know how to safely store bitcoin, do you even know how to use a hardware wallet and hold your own keys? Or do you just let some institution do that for you as well?
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:34:37
It probably is a condition yeah, but it's not more than I can afford to lose. If bitcoin crashed to zero I'd be fine, I'd have lost some money yeah but then I would simply start paying off my debt instead of buying bitcoin whenever I have extra cash.

"Never invest more than you can afford to lose" such a bullshit statement. Who can afford to lose anything? What does that even mean? Does that mean putting 5% of your portfolio in BTC? Can you afford to lose 5% of you portfolio? How about 55%? What about 100%? You can afford to lose 100% of your portfolio because it's all extra money that you don't need at the moment, it's still bullshit because no one can handle losing thier money

But then when I think in the long run 8k is nothing when we're pushing a mil
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:23:51
All of the examples you provided are a perfectly fine reason to buy bitcoin for double the market value. I'm simply calling bullshit that you are in any of the situations you listed above. My guess is that you FOMOed at the top around 20k and you used some institution to purchase your bitcoin for you, they charged you double the market price and you happily paid because you're a fool
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:23:41
The fact that you overpaid by double shows that you let someone else invest your money for you. Any exchange, and yes I do mean ANY exchange that you could have used would never have charged you double the market price for bitcoin. So your laziness cost you big time.

I definitely would, yes I agree it's not the Bitcoin way but hear me out, if we're all right and fiat does hyperinflate then wouldn't it be smart to take out a large relatively low interest fiat loan and buy bitcoin with it? Once fiat hyperinflates and bitcoin takes over you could pay that loan back with pocket change essentially

I don't have a 500 page paper about how this theoretical new system would work, I'm simply sharing some of my ideas. All I know is that taxation is theft and everything that I earn legally should be mine. The government shouldn't be allowed to take 15% of what I earn, 30% of the money I made off successful investments, and tax me for literally everything I buy including property taxes, car registration taxes and everything else I get taxed on. And to top it all off I don't even know where all that money is going, America is 20 trillion dollars is debt. Don't tell me the system we have is a long term sustainable one

@_date: 2019-06-25 07:23:02
That is a great reason to sell, did you re buy later on or are you content not hodling any Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:25:45
I think this is a fair question to ask, first off if the IMF did this it would have to be done privately because if the public found out about it then they would start doing the same thing and then fiat currency would hyper inflate extremely fast. 
So let's say they're printing and buying in private, buying a lot of coins without moving the price right now is extremely hard due to how many coins are for sale compared to how many are in cold storage. However let's say that this recent run up was a government buying bitcoin privately so that they could manipulate it. The question is what do they do once they've bought a lot?
Everone knows that Bitcoin can't be controlled so what does the government do? Do they dump all their coin on the open market and hope to drive the price so low that Bitcoin collapses? We've seen massive bear markets before and every time Bitcoin comes back because Bitcoin is still Bitcoin regardless of the price. Needless to say that by the time said government had enough coins to manipulate the market down by a large percentage the price of bitcoin will probably be over 100k due to them accumulating so much.
What price could they drive it down too? 20k? Maybe 10k? Regardless, unless Bitcoin suffers some catastrophic problem like a bug in the code or something similar I will continue to buy regardless of price. I know that others will do the same. So a government buying in an attempt to dump coins on the market would only works short term if at all, reality is that they would just drive the price up extremely high and then cause a minor dip.
We all know that Bitcoin can't be control by large groups, minors have tried and failed, individuals have tried and failed, if governments try on a large scale they will fail and in the process they will demonstrate why everyone in the world should be using Bitcoin as a currency, because it cannot be manipulated by outside agencies.
In closing I don't think you have anything to worry about, the worst case scenario is that a government accumulates a massive amount of bitcoins and then causes a bear market. Good for us because I know I'll be happy for cheaper bitcoin prices, and I know I'm not alone.

Exactly, and I continue to hear people telling everyone to sell their coin at 350k-450k to take profit and then just "buy back in" at 50k. There's no guarantee we have another 85% dip and a year long bear market, it would not surprise me if we never had another bear market ever again. Once the world realizes how valuable and scarce bitcoin is then I guarantee no one will sell, no one. You don't get bear markets unless people sell. Don't listen to what everyone is saying and sell your coin at 300k only to watch it hit 5mil 2 years later with no bear market in between

Nope, you just don't have access to the service that the tax pays for like free healthcare and free education. You still get to live there and you don't go to jail. Which would probably be better for some people if they don't want the free services anyways

It's on removeddit.com hit the link in this post, then hit the link in the comment, it will take you to the archived version
@_date: 2019-06-06 12:05:45
You like XRP huh? Lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:54:45
Yes fiat would be finished, I don't think we'd be trading cryptos to spend, I think everything would be priced in Bitcoin and satoshi's.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:49:51
Oh no
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:29:48
What's funny about Bitcoin is that you can have your cake "Tech" and you can eat it too "price"
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:21:17
I disagree, I think they simply want to be part of the whole bullshit blockchain thing. Once they give everyone access to zuckbucks people will be able to instant transfer it to an exchange and buy bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:34:39
You really don't understand how secure sha256 and Bitcoin is do you?
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:38:47
Nobody cares about worthless shitcoins doing pump and dumps
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:26:57
No it's not
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:07:26
You don't hail the mighty Luke Magnotta and his price predictions?
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:00:57
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:40:44
Really? I just tried it and it worked for me
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:21:47
Hodl unless you NEED the money. You'll wanna suck my dick in 5 years I guarantee it.
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:30:34
It is it's just called voluntary taxes
I never said Bitcoin would her rid of taxes, it will simply make them optional and not mandatory.
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:43:29
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:56:49
Shut the fuck up OP
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:37:39
Exactly, essentially every state would be privatized. It would provide services to its citizens
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:09:54
Nah I only hodl Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:56:27
Bitcoin can still 10,000x you fool
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:34:31
My educated guess would be 2025-2050
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:41:15
The app is unusable for me, the app never loads when I try to open the camera to take a picture of my ID
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:12:09
Yeah I'm just guessing as too how the new system would work with everyone free from taxes
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:12:30
Are you mad bro? I use the work tax because there's not a better word. For paying the state to get things in return. Maybe a tithe?
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:51:45
Bitcoin sounds like the biggest pyramid scheme of all time if you haven't done your research. People claiming there is almost no way for the price to go down long term sounds to good to be true...
Until you understand that Bitcoin can be transferred anywhere in the world at any time you want for extremely low fees. Once you grasp that it all makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:45:52
Because you're not paying more for it when you utilize it. Right now you're paying taxes and you're paying for healthcare. If the future you may be only paying taxes
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:30:55
Think whatever you want too man
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:31:15
Lol rough
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:02:40
Fair enough
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:37:33
I hear you I really do, or I could continue to pay the minimum on my debt and keep buying bitcoin short term and then paying off all my small debt at once during the next bullrun.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:55:55
Doesn't that make you happy
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:35:28
That'll only work for the first year tops, once people realize that it's just more worthless tokens it's game over
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:39:40
You sound like everyone else who doesn't get it, once hyperbitcoinization happens it will completely hyper inflate every fiat currency in the world. If you're lucky you'll be able to buy any amount of bitcoin before everyone simply stops accepting fiat. You don't understand that no one is going to accept anything besides bitcoin in the future, you can ask to pay with dollars, yen, gold or silver and they'll say no and refuse to sell you anything unless you pay them in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is inevitable whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:37:46
Jinxed it you fool
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:18:08
I like it
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:10:29
I agree they'll be happy, but do you really think that many people will do it? Maybe a couple will but I doubt it'll be alot
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:13:32
Did you read my whole comment? Didn't thing so
@_date: 2019-12-28 13:08:08
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:49:21
Because taxation is theft
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:51:10
Pyramid or Ponzi same thing to the average guy, tomato tomato
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:53:48
Hyperbitcoinization or bust
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:58:03
If it goes to 120k it's going to 250k
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:45:17
Haha right
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:09:11
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:34:29
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:33:46
Remember one thing, all of your predictions are in US dollar amounts. If the USD hyper inflates then 1 billion dollars won't be worth anything. Once fiat hyperinflates nothing matters anymore
@_date: 2019-12-28 02:19:28
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:34:05
Agreed, it's really scary when you think about it. Oh well I guess we can figure that out from the citadels
@_date: 2019-12-29 05:47:10
Truth, I wouldn't be so mad if the government didn't waste everyone's tax dollars. They steal from everyone and then waste so much of the stolen money on worthless things. Burn it all to the ground.
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:52:10
You might be the dumbest bitcoiner alive
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:05:34
We're all gonna make it brah
@_date: 2019-02-08 22:41:39
Go big or go homeless
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:22:26
Yeah I can easily see 100k this year, then after the halvening in May we push towards 1 million. After that the moon
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:09:50
Nah, think larger than that
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:51:29
They've endured 100s or years because people haven't had a choice in the past...now they do
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:14:56
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:30:03
Do explain wise one
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:37:10
You realize that you sound like a internet educated socialist who doesn't know anything about economics
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:43:02
Haha yeah typo, but I agree and I think that the reason most don't do it is because they don't fully understand it. The majority of people in the world don't know what money is or where it came from. They swipe their credit cards and that's it. Eventually they will be forced to learn but by that time it will be too late
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:30:23
I think you're right about the 4 million price, everyone and I mean everyone has been saying 350k is the highest were going to go this cycle, they're telling everyone to sell at that price and then buy when we drop to 50k, it's fucking bullshit, lemme know how it works out for them because they're going to FOMO back in once they sell at 350k and wake up the next morning to Bitcoin at 500k. After we hit a million a coin we may never have another bear market like we just had, we may just have average size dips of about 25%
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:47:54
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:23:43
Privacy is already in the works, do your research, it takes time to get it peer reviewed and implemented but it's on its way
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:15:58
Yeah you're right, this is good advice
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:28:00
I understand that because I considered doing the same thing, I chose to just buy instead. Do you sell everything you mine for fiat or do you hodl it?
@_date: 2019-12-28 13:06:31
The vast majority of the world like to be paid in something that has value
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:38:13
I'm FOMOing hard right now and I've been accumulating like a madman for the last year  wtf
@_date: 2019-06-08 06:17:06
That's a good point
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:32:35
Jesus Christ now I understand why everyone isn't running full nodes all willy nilly, you'd be paying $250 a month for internet alone
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:43:50
Haha bitcoin is going to hit 10k and there will still be people waiting for the 3k dip to buy. Fools never learn
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:28:48
This is if he is actually telling the truth
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:21:09
It was actually December 14th 2018 it bottomed but close though 
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:47:17
You sound like someone who's still invested in the blockchain crypto pyramid scheme who's down 98% since 2017. Give it up man everything and I mean everything besides Bitcoin is a shitcoin. The sooner you realize that the better off your life will be
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:57:50
Good luck...lol
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:54:13
That's the thing, I 100% expect it to gain more than the interest I pay right now, I just don't know
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:39:44
Well the mempool is obviously high due to this fast rise stop being so impatient
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:00:11
You, son of a bitch, I'm in
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:53:49
They'll learn with time, I'm not going to waste my time trying to explain it to everyone. Either you get it now or you dont
@_date: 2019-12-29 07:36:20
I think it's 30% if you sell within a year, 10% if you hold for a year then sell
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:56:05
You make it sound all easy, just get out of debt bro, just pay everything off today man, just do it no big deal. It is a big deal man, people can't just pay off their car notes and credit cards overnight. Do we want too? Yes we obviously want to be out of debt and have 6 months of emergency money saved. The majority of us can't do that even if we sell our bitcoin. Bitcoin is our moonshot, sometimes you have to take shots in life and when you come across something so life changing as Bitcoin could be sometimes you take the hit of paying a little more interest because you want bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:27:51
It does if you think outside the box
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:53:03
Chances are 70% that we hit new lows? So your advice would be to sell then? Okay lol
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:51:09
Yeah that's the way I see it too, so far you've never lost if you've held BTC
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:28:14
It's your fault for leaving it on coinbase. Not your keys not your coins
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:34:11
I'm sorry man, I can imagine how it feels
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:53:32
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:39:39
Monero is a shitcoin bro sorry to be the one that tells you
@_date: 2019-12-29 05:25:43
Well you can claim losses up to 5k I think but still paying 30% or 10% of your winnings is a pretty raw deal
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:57:18
Yeah that too
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:10:21
Nah they don't prefer it they just have no other option
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:37:47
Why? Let them burn through Bitcoin by paying the miners securing our network. I guarantee they leave when they go broke and cant affect fees anymore. Miners get paid and the bad actors go broke paying fees. Win win
@_date: 2019-12-30 00:27:51
I would invest all of it into bitcoin right now, as long as you can hold for 2 years minimum. Just ensure that you use a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor and have multiple copies of your 24 word seed that were generated by yourself you'll do well. Oh and an additional 25th word passphrase is strongly recommended. Good luck
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:08:39
I just looked up the 10 year chart of the DOW and the SP 500, its almost straight up. I'd be massively worried about the future if Bitcoin didn't exist
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:12:44
Solid thanks
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:31:16
We need time locked Bitcoin onchain to become a thing. I'd lock some of mine up for 5 years or so. We could easily check how much is time locked and it would probably raise the price as well
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:30:56
I wouldn't go to that meeting if I were you. He might be waiting with police officers, those guys don't take kindly to identify fraud. 300 isn't that bad to lose in the long run trust me
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:42:58
I'm probably sure the SEC hasn't approved bakkt yet, hence the delay
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:11:49
6400 is the key number, if we can hold that then it's game on
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:49:23
XRP and SV? You had me playing along until you mentioned those steaming piles of shit. You played yourself
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:26:42
I'd suggest framing a few copies with your signature and the date. In the future when were in the millions people may look back at these and laugh that we were happy about a $1000 gain. They might even pay you a lot of satoshis to buy one because it's nostalgic 
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:18:21
Agreed however Bitcoin is the most secure network ever created with some of the brightest minds alive writing code for it. I'm not at all worried about quantum computing not even a little. We'll transition to quantum secure addresses long before it's a problem 
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:46:18
These comments sound like you're trying to set up a pump and dump
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:12:57
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:58:28
Yeah I don't think it helps anyone or anything if we know who he is. Everyone already knows it's not Craig
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:30:17
Um...no, those are personal miners. People like you and me.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:25:07
Maybe yes, maybe no. It's up to you
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:41:42
It's your bank man it's not the exchanges. I'd suggest trying to change bank accounts.
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:32:02
True it can he denied, but IF McAfee is telling the truth he also claims that he has proof of who Satoshi is.

@_date: 2019-12-28 21:26:26
You don't cash out
@_date: 2019-04-08 03:11:09
Yeah true however I'd rather pay an extra 50 cents and have my transaction included in the next block then saving the 50 cents and it takin an hour to get into a block
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:09:21
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:32:31
It's gonna be funny in 2 weeks when we pass 6k
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:30:02
How much did you lose?
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:02:31
True, but you should look up how secure sha 256 is, it's impossible to comprehend how long it would take to hack
@_date: 2019-12-29 05:55:34
Definitely, I'd never complain about a flat rate 10% income tax to fund the military, secure our boarders and pay police and firefighters, but spending trillions of dollars on endless wars really grinds my gears
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:34:22
If they're really doing 15% of all Bitcoin transactions let's just wait until the next bullrun and see if they're willing to pay massive massive fees every block. I doubt they'll be that profitable by then. Either way if they're willing to pay the fee then they're allowed to play because anyone can use Bitcoin for anything and that's the beauty of it. Veriblock won't last if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:32:08
This probably won't age well
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:30:28
I agree, it's not McAfee's decision to make, it's Satoshi's. If he is actually still alive then he obviously didn't think that CSW claiming to be him was a big enough issue to reveal himself.
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:51:44
I would definitely use it. Once hyperbitcoinization happens every merchant will accept bitcoin, Amazon Ebay, and everyone else will accept sats for their products. It's just a matter of time. Bitcoin is inevitable. Hodl.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:43:32
I believe his bet was during 2020 so that means he has until December 31st 2020 to be correct 
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:40:14
You can't be serious, any price under 1 million dollars is a massive steal. When you look at all the wealth in the world tied up in worthless fiat currencies you realize that 12k bitcoin is fucking dirt cheap
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:28:14
That might be the worst idea I've ever heard in my whole life
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:04:12
Unless you control the private keys you actually own 0.00 Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:43:07
Good luck. Maybe you win or maybe you FOMO  back in at 10k 
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:49:59
Once Bitcoin hits 1M that guy will still look like a genius
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:08:32
Jesus man, I'm pretty sure you're going to get taken to court soon, banks dont mess around when you don't pay them back
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:40:34
Set a date on your phone and buy a certain amount without looking at the price. Look back in 5 years and you'll be happy 
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:36:29
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:56:43
I agree with you for the most part, however why does everyone assume that someone with quantum computing is malicious? In not well read on the subject but they would have to know that if they decided to start mining with that quantum computer they would get massively rich. Compared to destroying the price short term until we fork away.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:53:17
Unlikely seeing that the price is now over 5150 his sell order would have finished hours ago. My guess is he'll have to use coinbase support, which as we all know is non existent...God help him
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:50:17
Could be people transferring from wallet to exchange to sell as well. Or people buying things with Bitcoin, or literally anything else at all
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:48:01
Can anyone honestly think that if the dollar hyperinflates that millennials are going to buy gold over bitcoin? It's hard to buy and hard to sell, you have to get it shipped to you and it's hard to secure. bitcoin is simply better in every way.
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:39:26
That's a pretty achievable goal I'd say
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:33:48
Agreed 
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:26:36
I'm not voting for this socialist
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:22:44
They do but only for your USD account. If they get hacked and you have 1 Bitcoin on there well you're fucked
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:19:36
100% educated guessing. That's it plain and simple 
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:17:53
Nice! I'm waiting for a wallet on my phone with a built in full node that utilizes the lightning network. Once I have that I'll start spending.
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:05:55
I bought the dip today did you?
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:02:18
Agreed if you're worried about short term price action then you've already lost
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:26:13
Fool me can't get fooled again 
@_date: 2019-12-29 02:50:15
True taxation is theft but especially capital gains tax
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:33:33
It's not free, they sell for $100 above market price. They just don't say there's fees, which there is but it's hidden in the price. Coinbase is very similar when it comes to price
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:28:25
I feel bad for the future you after she divorces you and takes half your things. That ring will equal about 10 million dollars
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:34:42
You still get some sats you just won't mine any blocks
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:50:50
Proof is proof. Time will tell.
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:38:48
That's fair
@_date: 2019-04-01 11:31:46
Well done. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:34:25
I'd start prepping 6k-10k tonight just to be safe
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:03:45
They all want your privates 
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:12:28
Very low
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:49:36
1 million bitcoin is still in play during 2020. John mcfee still has a shot at keeping his dick
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:37:35
Let the miners eat, they're an essential part of Bitcoin. I wouldn't be mad seeing $100 fees, it will help push lightning adoption 
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:31:17
Yes exactly, that's all in it's way, it just might take another couple years to get implemented
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:52:36
If it goes to 5500 tomorrow do you buy back in or do you wait?
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:53:12
Spike that won't last
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:01:33
I'm with you
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:17:37
He also claims that there is a terrible story behind it that most won't like.
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:31:21
A nobody
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:07:39
I bought 6 hours before the dip, I feel your pain on a molecular level, I thought I was the most unlucky person yesterday, I was wrong lol
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:35:03
What a low quality shitpost

Honestly I really want too, I would have to charge a premium in order to afford the flights out there and the opendime. Also I don't know if police or the government would be too happy with me doing that so legal complications might abound, then I have the problem of finding people who are willing to pay a 5 to 10% premium on the bitcoin.  Then I'd have to exchange the local currency that I was paid in back into USD before I leave, I believe you cant fly with more than 10grand of currency. So it would take some work.

My last aha moment was when I started researching all the amazing ideas that were thought to be stupid at the time but turned out to change the world. 
Cars over horses, airplanes over cars, the internet over handwritten letters, there's so many examples of so called "experts" just dismissing something that they don't understand. 
I feel this partially to be true about Bitcoin, I feel that half the critics don't actually understand it, but the other half actually do understand it they just don't want it to succeed so they attempt to criticize and ridicule it as being stupid, exactly like the banks are doing right now. The banks are fully aware of how powerful Bitcoin could become, that's why they are attacking it and trying to kill it by bashing it, they know Bitcoin could completely destroy them. 
I don't feel as if I know anything esoteric about Bitcoin, I simply know what I can read online or in books just like everyone else can. That's the beauty of Bitcoin, anyone and everyone can examine everything about Bitcoin, there is nothing that's hidden or known only by a few, as far as I know.

I think that everyone with a job should want Bitcoin to stay in a bear market for another year. 
Technology advances rapidly during bear markets because everyone isn't focused on price and there arnt massive transaction fees.
Also you can accumulate much more Bitcoin if we stay in a bear market through 2019
Sure seeing the price rise is satisfying but it's bear markets are good for Bitcoin.

This is the main issue with Bitcoin currently that may hinder adoption, however we have some of the most brilliant minds submitting pull requests and writing code to solve this problem.

Yeah I suppose you're right as far as average investors go, I was more talking about the big whales like Ver and Wright, if they burn through all their bitcoin and have to keep liquidating in order to fund the hash was then once their broke they wont have very many bitcoin left.

100% correct, this is why I don't think there is any strategy in the Bitcoin game besides buying whenever you have money to blow and hodling 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:41:09
Bitcoin has the best fundamentals of anything ever created in this world
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:14:19
You're 100% correct, you repeat this enough times and you're broke...however think about this.
Let's say you lose 10-20% every time you sell the 500btc on an exchange. If you're rich enough this wont affect you for a long time.
The Incentive then is this, if I can manipulate the price down myself by selling 500btc how will this affect other investors?
Every drop in price more hodlers liquidate. People have sell orders in, and some people just get sick of seeing thier money disappear month after month. So they sell after they see the dip I'm price which you caused by selling.
If you have enough money and do this process a few time you're going to shake out lots of weak hand. Lots of them.
Once you're happy with the price you then start to accumulate  Bitcoin  OTC for cheap prices like 5k. Maybe you'll even throw a few big buys on an exchange just to kickstart the next bullrun and get all the people you shook out to fomo back in. 
This is one Institution with deep pockets. Now think if they're all working together. 
It's a crazy theory I know but you're crazier if you think I'm selling

Not exactly that, hodlers slowly zap the volatility out of the market by buying and hodling. There is less bitcoin to be bought and traded with. Hodling effects the entire network in a good way. Panic selling the bottom hurts it. Hodlers promote adoption because it slowly becomes more expensive and then more people want it and then they buy it and they become hodlers and the cycle repeats

I've been considering flying to countries where buying bitcoin is illegal and offering it to anyone who wants it for a 5-10% premium on a opendime bitcoin stick. I'd have some problems without a doubt. Please reply if you have any ideas for me
First I'd have to charge a premium in order to afford the flights out there and also the opendime themselves. 
I don't know if police or the government would be too happy with me doing that so legal complications might abound?
I would have the problem of finding people who are willing to pay a 5 to 10% premium on the bitcoin.  
Then I'd have to exchange the local currency that I was paid in back into USD before I leave, I believe you cant fly with more than 10grand of currency.

I'm sure they would as well. Seeing that he released Bitcoin as an alternative money right after the housing market collapsed kinda makes be believe that he cares about the economies around the world and how they're handled, as opposed to him creating Bitcoin just to make himself wealthy.
I like to think he could fix some wrongs with the world if he came back, although Bitcoin should take care of most of that by itself if it gets widely adopted.

@_date: 2018-11-19 23:24:52
Yeah you need to play for Bitcoin dropping to 1k for the next 2 years. If you can hodl that long you're going to win
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:39:04
I 100% agree with you brother, that is exactly my opinion, I thought 6k was the floor based off kwh per coin and I invested accordingly. I was surprised to see Bitcoin drop below that. The difficulty just dropped 7% too so mining is more profitable now as well. I don't see us staying below 6k for very long, but some disagree and think we're heading for 3 and 4k
@_date: 2018-11-09 08:14:47
Imagine if S. N. Is the US government and Bitcoin is just an idea to get us out of debt. Make everyone run from the dollar as the reserve currency to Bitcoin, which coincidentally they own over a million of. It wouldn't be the greatest ploy of all mankind 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:16:35
The goal is accumulating as much bitcoin as possible before hyperbitcoinization. Everything else is trivial 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:21:16
I'm pretty sure that once we broke 6k we learned that the cost of mining a bitcoin doesn't create a floor for the price.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:20:30
Something will replace fiat. For example let's say bitcoin, we will be payed in btc and we will buy things in btc. Banks will have the majority of btc and they will lend that to people the same way they do now with fiat. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:02:19
This is true, I suppose we plan on being employed for the next 10 years at least so we are planning on that steady paycheck if we get fired things change really fast. However I think some people might be scared to lose money even if they could afford it, they might put in $100 and sell when it drops 10% they don't need that money but they just get really bothered by losing it so they sell when they don't have too.

Ehhhh I dunno if I would agree with it being bad, every asset in history can be traded in many different ways so bitcoin is no different than anything else in that regard.

This is exactly why the next bull run will be massive, everyone has heard about it.

I use ledger but I don't think it really Matters as long as you store the majority of your bitcoin in a passphrase protected address, because then it doesn't matter if you have 100 copies of your seed laying around, no one can access your passphrase protected address without the passphrase that should only be stored in your head

Why does everyone assume he is dead? I guess it's because they think that Satoshi is Hal, I don't think so. I think he left because he realized that if he stayed Bitcoin could never achieve true decentralization because he would be viewed as the one who controls the network.
Satoshi could be some 30 year old prodigy who created Bitcoin during his teens. If he came back once Bitcoin took over the world he would be jailed as a God, everyone would already be using Bitcoin as currency so they wouldn't be worried about satoshi taking it over or anything like that.
With his stack of bitcoin he could pretty play God because he would be the richest person in existence. Let's hope he's a fair God

What happens if the dollar hyperinflates and Bitcoin skyrockets? The millionaire's will still be wealthy because of their assets like homes and buissness's. I think the 1% will just fomo in a little bit later than the middle class because they aren't worried about getting out of poverty.

Don't send it back to coinbase, you're completely missing the point of the proof of keys event. The point is to encourage everyone to withdraw from a exchanges to a wallet that they control. You do not control your coinbase wallet, they do. You only control a wallet if you hold the private keys for it

You're thinking about it all wrong, sure 55 dollars isn't much incentive for people to rob your house for, however you saying that you own a million satoshi's doesn't imply that you ONLY have 1m satoshi's, you may have 100m or a trillion sats and the only thing the attacker knows is that you own satoshi's. I just think it's not smart, especially seeing the level that were at with security being that the best way to secure your sats is to hold your private keys, that makes attackers think they can break into your house and steal all your sats, doesn't matter the amount. Once security becomes better I wouldn't hesitate to buy this shirt, until then though I really dont wanna advertise that I own anything besides worthless dollars

You didn't but I feel like it's the general consensus around satoshi, since we haven't heard from him in years that he must be dead, but I don't believe it. Hal Finney made that famous tweet about running bitcoin right when it launched, if he was satoshi I doubt he would have tweeted that.
But yeah hyperbitcoinization may be decades away or it may be much closer no one knows. I'm just thinking to myself what kind of power satoshi would have if he returned with 1 million coins. He could essentially do anything he wanted with that money if he wanted, almost like the rothschild family does today

I don't respect a self proclaimed hodler if you've ever sold in a bear market. It's a right of passage, you help Bitcoin by not selling in a massive bear market, even better is buying through it. That's my goal for this bear market  to continue to buy twice a month regardless of price

This needs to be day one knowledge if you're invested in Bitcoin. Sadly it is not.

Honestly we need gas stations and groceries stores to start accepting bitcoin, as soon as they do I won't have a problem paying a few extra dollars converting my fiat into bitcoin and buying every day things with it. Once we can pay our electric bill and our car note or mortgage with bitcoin we can finally start to put pressure on the banks. Until this happens it's just a store of value.

MUST READ!!!
If you understand Bitcoin fundamentals and you haven't overinvested then you're not worried about this crash.
If you don't understand Bitcoin fundamentals or you have overinvested then I understand why you're worried.
If you don't understand Bitcoin then read "The Bitcoin standard". If you've overinvested then sell whatever amount you need to in order to not be worried about Bitcoin constantly 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:06:19
Peoople buy bitcoin in more currencies than just the dollar, and what happens during hyperinflation?
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:56:38
I bought 6 hours before the dip, however I still own the same amount of bitcoin so I have that going for me

I mean for me I never buy at all time highs, it just seems like common sense, the lower the better as long as it's not a shitcoin. But it's the higher the better for all newcomers. My buddy told me to invest at 10k I missed it and now its 15k I need to buy twice as much. Anyone who thought about it in December and didn't buy is almost guaranteed to buy once it hits 10k
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:31:02
We don't, that's my point, I'm sure there are hundreds of people who have made up fake stories about loved ones just to get rich, they usually post their name. The fact that this is a random paragraph about someone losing their house with no names or anything, it's most likely a scam

"The proposed ETF would be priced from a bundle of crypto assets" I wonder if it would almost be like the DOW or the S&amp;P 500, whatever the case whatever assets they choose to be a part of the bundle their price would absolutely leave earth.

It won't matter anyone who does a few minutes of research will know the difference. Also the ETF that will he approved for Bitcoin not Bcash so there will be no one buy bcash when that happens 
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:42:49
I've seen this exact same kind of post before, they have no idea how the "hacker" got through Google authentication. That would clearly be a massive breach and I'm sure Google would have said something about it. But I cant figure out why make this post if it's fake? And it certainly looks like it

Yes that's exactly what I'm saying, that they are correct beyond belief. Maybe they're not trying to give investors with deep pockets first dibs, I would guess they would be more trying to protect the .1% from Bitcoin. They're trying to save the current form of money and power that we currently have now.

Gold isn't used because it isn't feasible to spend as it can't be paid in small amounts. Also who wants to carry gold with them? The incentive to commit robbery would huge. Bitcoin will begin to be used as money when the price stabilizes and the lighting network is implemented. Right now the correct move is to hodl.

I've done that, it took me 7 days to get the money into the account but once it's there the buy is instant. It's cool if the price went down in those 7 days but if the price went up you would have been better off just buying straight from your linked account.

There will always be people who want to sell yes, but if there are more people that want to buy there will come a point when there are no more coins to buy besides the ones that are being mined.

Is it really that suprising that the SEC doesn't want Bitcoin to succeed? Honestly? The people there have their hands in everything and I'm sure Bitcoin threatens them. It's just a matter of time. Bitcoin is worldwide, all the SEC can do is temporarily delay it and look like fools while they do it.

Most people want the ETF because we know it will trigger the next bullrun, this is true. It will also lead to greater adoption and mainstream acceptance which is what EVERYONE wants. I couldn't care less about a ETF, I want mainstream acceptance and adoption and I know that  ETF will assist that. I don't plan on selling so a short term price gain doesn't affect me. Buy Bitcoin.

"People are more comfortable buying at $7800 than they were buying at $6000, and they'll probably be even more comfortable buying at $10,000."  Its so true but so often ignored, once Bitcoin hits 10k watch it skyrocket back to ATH's overnight. It seems backward to think like this but just watch it happen, most people aren't extremely smart. Remember people were mortgaging their houses to buy when Bitcoin was 19k.

Well seeing that the US dollar is already past the average lifetime for a fiat currency I would tend to say sooner rather than later, but I'd guess at least by 2050 if not a lot sooner. Maybe 2035

Is it really that suprising that the SEC doesn't want Bitcoin to succeed? Honestly? The people there have their hands in everything and I'm sure Bitcoin threatens them. It's just a matter of time. Bitcoin is worldwide, all the SEC can do is temporarily delay it and look like fools while they do it.

There is no problem with a deflationary currency. People will only buy what they NEED. Not what they want. Bad money drives out good money. People save the good and spend the bad. Right now people are spending fiat and saving Bitcoin, exactly the way it should be
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:09:30
What's everyone's strategy for cashing out during the next bullrun? I only hodl bitcoin and I find it more and more likely that I won't cash out due to the fact that I believe sometime in the future all fiat will be worthless and I don't wanna be left hodling a massive bag of fiat.

My opinion is that when bitcoin gets past 20k people will sell every alt coin they own for Bitcoin,  after the run is down who knows is might be alt season again, maybe not

I think $1000 will be trivial, the next run could take us easily to 100k so a change of 5k or maybe even 10k a day would only be 5-10% change which is about what we're doing now give or take

People are finally waking up to the truth about banks. They're almost all Bitcoin hodlers. Once the rest of the world wakes up and realizes that there is a better way to conduct transactions everyone will stop using banks to the max extent possible, obviously direct deposit from work will still be used, but besides that the banks will have no function besides giving out loans. Bitcoin can and will do everything better, cheaper and faster than banks can, and more secure as well.

There is no ETF for the USD or any other fiat currency because they aren't sound money. Gold has an ETF because it was sound money and is still a solid store of value. Bitcoin is sound money, it's gold 2.0 except that it's easly transferable and spendable. It's the perfect revolutionary world currency.

Yes an exchange of power would happen but if we start to approach that I feel like all the millionaires, billionaires and trillionaires would spend their fiat on bitcoin and they would remain rich.

The main reason is there are not alot of new investors. Also because there are not alot of places that accept bitcoin. Once the lighting network is implemented and more buissness's start accepting it the transactions will skyrocket.

I mean North Korea is already doing that, all the regular citizens only have access to a limited version of the internet where all the sites they access are propaganda websites. As far as that goes I dont know why a simple VPN wouldn't work against regulation like that. If you have a VPN you should be able to access the full internet, so you would still have access to Bitcoin. The only thing that would affect it is if every government banned companies from selling, buying or accepting Bitcoin. EVERY country would have to participate and we all know that would never happen. I think bitcoin is at a point that it literally can't be stopped. The price will fluctuate based on current events, but you can't kill an idea.

Doubling the userbase wouldn't do anything for the price if they buy a insignificant amount of crypto. Just like a single user could add 200 mil to the market cap and spike the price. Metcalfe's law just says the more users the more value of the network there is. Just because there is more users doesn't mean the price will explode

In the future once all the bitcoin are mined our phones will have chips that will be capable of confirming transactions on the network. I don't know if the big mining farms will still make money by just confirming transactions so they might call it quits.

@_date: 2018-04-24 09:37:30
Absolutely agreed, however when the majority of people go to buy Bitcoin every exchange has it listed correctly. No one will confuse the two based of name and more importantly price. A newcomer to Coinbase will clearly see Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash below it, that and the price, no one is going to think Bitcoin is now $1500. They all see the news and that's the reason they're going to invest, they see Bitcoin climbed past 10k. I honestly don't believe that anyone would confuse the two when purchasing. The only thing that Btrash accomplishes is looking immature and childish to anyone who knows anything about crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:45:04
That definitely should be in our roadmap but not yet I feel. If everyone tries to do that the transaction fees will skyrocket like last year and it will scare new investors away. I think we need to wait for lightning.

Upon further review;  The world has never seen anything like Bitcoin before. Therefore it can't be defined by any laws or theories of anything that might apply to it. Bitcoin is Freedom from everything society has taught you, it can he used as money, or as gold. It's an ever changing ever growing technology that we can't be controlled or defined. Bitcoin is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, the fact that someone was once willing to pay almost 20k for one is amazing. Some people invest to get rich, but the other people, people like us we invested in the idea.

Yeah I agree that some will but just think about this, let's say a millionaire buissness owner wants to get into Bitcoin ASAP, he has a few options he can start accepting bitcoin at his buissness to accumulate that way or he could take buy as many bitcoins as he can afford. I suppose it all depends on the person and if he thinks people will actually spend bitcoin at his buissness or not.

I hope nobody trusts this guy. Look bitcoin will either go up or go down. There I'm going to be right it's guaranteed. My personal opinion on when the right time to invest new fiat is. "Buy what you can, when you can, with what you have." Don't try to time the market. If you have leftover money from a paycheck invest it as soon as available. If you try to listen to "experts" understand that their guessing. Just buy and hodl. Cash out at your moon and go home happy.

To your first point, once the USD crashes...and it will because its inflated by 98% since we left the gold standard, everyone will lose their money. Their dollars they've been saving will be worthless despite them doing nothing. Once people see that dollars are just paper and that their government won't pay them back I think that will be the turning point for the majority to turn to a reliable currency like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:14:05

Well maybe they'd be confused if they invested by themselves, but I think most people get told by someone about crypto, and unless their a btrash fan they will tell them bitcoin.

Well obviously that's a given, you cant still be hodling bitconnect because you went long and it died. You have to invest in solid blue chip coins. And even then crypto isn't guaranteed to be around 10 or 20 years down the road, so it's a gamble either way.

No they can't regulate blockchain. However they can regulate where you buy it and spend it. So they can easily manipulate the market but not the blockchain

$400 dollars isn't worth keeping just spend it on something, it's not like you have $1000 or anything

Hodlers are the revolutionaries who consistently take supply off the table by buying every month. They eat up supply and they never sell. The bear markets are less and less worse due to hodlers of last resort. The bull markets are greater and greater thanks to hodlers of last resort. Buy Bitcoin. Hodl.

Exactly, Bitcoin is always improving. The coin may fluctuate in price but the network has been steadily growing stronger
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:56:55
Yes absolutely I would, I don't mean to say that I wouldn't buy a nice house and a nice car on the way up, but I wouldn't ever sell the majority of my BTC for fiat currency. There's no point to cash out and hodl fiat. Makes zero sense

Yes, obviously if hyperbitcoinization happens every fiat currency will hyperinflate in an extraordinarily way. USD could hyperinflate 10,000% easy
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:05:54
On chain transactions are slow and will become far more expensive in the future for sure, however 2nd layers like the lightning network will function. Ore as money, extremely fast transactions and accepted everywhere
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:30:28
You're 100% wrong, the goal is not to cash out to the dollar, that is only for moonboys. I'll never sell my Bitcoin for any fiat currency, why would I? I would be exchanging my sound money which cannot hyperinflate to a currency that is backed by nothing where hyperinflation is a serious concern. I choose Bitcoin. I don't sell the bottom or the top. I hodl.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:04:50
As predict during the 2017 bullrun, any cryptocurrency with a solid idea or use case will be implemented in Bitcoin because Bitcoin is acquired sound money.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:14:47
Or not
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:33:06
Nah, I won't
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:42:41
False, if Bitcoin is the only money that is accepted worldwide then people will still obviously have to use it to live, rent, groceries, and everything else they need they will pay for in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:04:01
Very true, good point
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:49:12
This is why it's such an amazing time to be buy Bitcoin, because right now the only people that are buying are people that actually understand it. Most of the world doesn't understand yet, but when they do is when we're going to se hyperbitcoinization 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:34:47

You don't need to be an extremely technical person to understand Bitcoin. Simply read "The Bitcoin Standard" you learn the fundamentals of sound money and that is more than enough to understand Bitcoin

Here's the thing, if you're not smart enough to realize that big institutions are pushing the price down and accumulating massive amounts of bitcoin during this bear market I don't know what to tell you. Once you realize to look at what the big guys are doing and not what they're saying you'll realize you should be buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:20:43
Exactly. My bet for the future is on Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:05:16
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:04:55
I'd hold on to it if you don't need the money right now. The stock market has been in a 10 year bullrun so I'm extremely cautious about that. Bitcoin is the future
@_date: 2018-12-11 07:28:40
It was the best prediction giving the current market condition 
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:12:29
I agree, I'm just suggesting putting these up just to get people thinking. Bitcoin needs to become a global store of value before it can become a means of exchange. Hodling is the best way to increase adoption

@_date: 2018-12-05 01:01:49
I agree but how do we educate people who are not interested in learning? We can't, we need to peak their interest in Bitcoin so that they educate themselves like all of us have. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:49:18
This post is 100% wrong at this certain time for Bitcoin. Bitcoin must become a global store of value before it can become a global currency. This takes time. 
The best method at this moment to help Bitcoin achieve global adoption is to buy and hodl.

@_date: 2019-05-11 05:42:34
You don't Bitcoin do you? At that price we won't be measuring anything in fiat anymore. No one will use it, no one will trade it, we won't even wipe out asses with it. It will simply cease to exist and the true unit of measurement will be used. 1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:36:04
It pretty much means think before you sell your Bitcoin for government money. If bitcoin goes to a million dollars and you cash out everything then you'll be rich in fiat money. What happens if your currency hyperinflates like Venezuela's did? Well you would be broke again and will no Bitcoin. 
The main point is that you can't stop someone from hodling a sounder form of money than you. Bitcoin is the most sound money of all time so it makes no sense to sell it for another currency 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:38:56

I agree
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:10:38
Yeah I definitely think it's a problem that we can't advertise it in real life without making ourselves a risk but then again it is Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:26:38
Oh I'm definitely sure, and yes Bitcoin is literally better in every way than gold.
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:06:36
Bitcoin is currently a collectable, soon it will become a store of value. Only after that happens can it become a global currency. Bitcoin must be globally accepted as money before people will accept it as a currency 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:40:49
If it stays below $10 for more than a year I'll be worried

I'm not using Bitcoin to hold my value stable, I'm buying it as a collectable in hopes I can help further adoption to get us to a store of value 
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:41:48
The best way to use bitcoin today is to buy and hodl. Bitcoin must become a store of value before it can become a means of exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:03:25
These are so stupid it hurts my brain. You're literally saying to people "come rob me because I own Bitcoin" how many stories do we need see about people getting beaten for their crypto before people stop advertising that they own it. Holy shit
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:26:50
This is so true, it could happen literally overnight. The longterm hodlers will be the ones who benefit the most, while the fearful get left behind with their pants around their ankles 
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:02:26
Exchanges offer us a service, they sell us bitcoin, where else are you going to buy? Your friends? Are you going to buy mining equipment and stop buy entirely? My point is we pay a small percentage for a service that they provide, I'm totally fine with paying 1.5% so I can exchange my dollars for the currency of the future.

Possibly the greatest bitcoin meme of all time. Long live the magic internet money 
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:09:27
Buy a Ledger Nano S
Write down the seed, make at least 3 copies and store them in separate locations. 
Transfer all coins to your Ledger.
Total cost is under $100 and maybe and hour of your time.
As long as you protect those 3 copies of your seed there is no way for you to ever lose your money.
If you have more than $500 worth of Bitcoin this is a must do.
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:35:32
Based on what you said in your first reply..."they will lose everything and not be able to afford iPhone 5s" it seems to me you're the one who needs to start thinking clearly because you're clearly not very intelligent.

Exactly, nothing is a guarantee 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:00:02
I think that a current problem we're facing is that most people view Bitcoin as a pump and dump scam when they're introduced to it. This is mostly our own fault because we all talk about price way too much. 
We need to change the narrative, change the way people think about Bitcoin. We need to promote it not as a get rich quick scheme but as an alternative to the current financial system that crashed the system in 08. We need to propose Bitcoin as a cure for the global debt problem that the entire world faces. 
If we can do this we can increase adoption much faster than just waiting for a new bullrun to entice new investors 
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:43:30
We're not even in a bullrun, Jesus did you get into Bitcoin yesterday?

@_date: 2019-05-22 12:01:24
We don't know that though, we feel strongly about it but nothing is guaranteed. That's why when we're holding through a 80% decline we get looked at like we're insane
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:07:36

@_date: 2018-12-19 00:42:01
You need to do more research about Bitcoin, there is massive incentive to hold the most sound money in the entire world. Russia is trying to opt out of the United states payment system as a big fuck you to the USA, once you understand digital scarcity and the history of money it looks like hyperbitcoinization is inevitable it appears to just be a matter of time
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:04:25

Let's say the USA bans companies from accepting Bitcoin and makes it a felony to transact with it. What happens next? I'll tell you...
Russia says they're accumulating Bitcoin as a big fuck you to the dollar and to the USA and now guess what? They're have a massive head start in accumulating Bitcoin. Other countries follow Russia's lead and eventually the USA will have to legalize Bitcoin and start accumulating or they will get left behind.

@_date: 2018-12-15 00:43:28
Bitcoin is extremely easy to secure and extremely hard to hack. The only security risk is not controlling your private keys or the $5 dollar wrench attack.
The wrench attack is the most worrying because if I know that you hold your keys and that you own a large amount of Bitcoin then the only thing I need is to find out is your address and force you to give it to me with a wrench. I assume in the future technology will easily solve this problem but until then it's wise to not publicize that you own a large amount of Bitcoin
