Random police officer instantly knows that Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin?......Highly unlikely.  At best, he's read the stunning CNN article about the "Bitcoin CEO".

I do.

Of course not, but I have no reason to worry about possibly thousands of people seeing my car parked outside of so-and-so place of business or even following me in traffic just out of curiosity of where I would be going.

If Steam starts accepting bitcoin/litecoin/etc....
I can see it now, "Yay, i just mined another $12 in crypto!....Aaaaannd it's gone."

A thousand times, this. Sometimes making an irresponsible decision should have repercussions.  No better way to learn from mistakes IMHO.

So..........more exchanges?

I thought the original purpose behind creating Bitcoins was that we would never have to rely on banks???

I am Satoshi Nakamoto, and i am **VERY** displeased with the way the media is harassing this gentleman in California.

I'm still waiting (and halfway hoping) that pictures of her home get spread all over the internet.
More than likely though, is that Newsweek will give her a slap on the wrist and nothing more.
*EDIT: just read further down that she is a freelance reporter.....hopefully she'll be thinking of a change in career soon.

Seems to me that this is just a shameless attempt at getting $5.99 from Newsweek...

OPEN LETTER-CEPTION.
We must look deeper....
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:43:31
Fair enough.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:42:58
Serves her right for aggressive and irresponsible reporting.

This thread just made my day, love this community lol

She crossed a line, and still defends her decision.  You really think a well worded open letter will change her mind at all?
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:00:07
Well said, friend.
