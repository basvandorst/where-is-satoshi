Because Saudi Royalty aren't going to waste billions on digital currencies that can be minted from thin air.
You’re right it doesn’t matter what “I” would do. You missed the point, what’s the incentive for anyone in the market to buy it for $1 million from you 10 years from now? What value does it add (not Blockchain, Blockchain technology has some value it remains to be seen how much, talking about ridiculously expensive crypto currencies that people keep thinking will go higher).

Here’s an article published this morning, apparently at the beginning of the year bitcoin had 90% market share and today it’s at 45%

Totally logical

Regarding starting a fiat currency, it’s not exactly easy to start your own country and central bank. Usually it’s expensive requires political capital and land. 
That said lots of currencies have been created that are completely worthless. 
Also, I’m not sure if it is reasonable to compare assets or currencies to corporations (this may be the pot calling the kettle black here, since I referred to multiple corporations in earlier posts but this is a new thought on that), I do not think any world governments will standby and let currency be privatized by a corporate entity. Maybe globalized by a decentralized entity by not privatized, they would have too much issue with that sort of push. Also, there is no commonality between currencies &amp; assets and company market share. These appear (at least to me at face value) to be independent variables.

Also you have to consider if you just keep tacking on to an 8 year old system it’s like a snowball going downhill the codeball keeps growing and growing and so do the inefficiencies.
When you start from scratch you can anticipate the known problems and create efficient elegant solutions instead of tacked on snowball solutions. 
Another advantage of private development (within a regulated and ethical framework, competition will drive down costs) is that decisions are agile and streamlined and cohesive...so is the product. This is much more difficult to do with open source development. 
Think Linux vs Apple vs Windows vs Android always the private development with agile direction wins. That’s not to say that Linux doesn’t have good things going on it just lacks that refined cohesiveness to allow mass adoption. You will never get an Apple or other Enterprise level product from an open source team. 
The drawback is enterprises flop apples, Microsoft’s, googles they all eventually go out of business. Meanwhile the open source counterpart keeps on ticking .... so maybe on a long time scale the open source is better?!? But some of these companies last over a century. I’m all the time reading about companies founded in the 1800s by so and so and they are still in business today. Which means in my lifetime there is likely to be most of the major tech companies for a long time.

I always kind of felt a Blockchain currency supported by a central bank made more sense. Within a regulated framework the ethics and optics are much improved. 
But the benefit of lower cost, faster, more secure transactions (still not quantum brute forcing proof) would make this a good replacement for visa/Amex/MasterCard style credit/debit cards.
It also might make sense for a central bank to run if we ever move to a living wage due to automation taking all the jobs. The central bank collects taxes from the corporate entities and then disperse it to the digital coin account (an on going quantitative easing program, balanced by incoming tax revenue).

In 10 years why will I want your coin with my million dollars instead of shares of s&amp;p 500 stock, gold, etfs, real estate, government bonds, a fiat currency or any of the other multiple investment options available?
What value does the coin give that I cannot get elsewhere with less risk? If bc was worth 1 million, I’d much rather have 1 million worth of rental properties for a steady 10k per month income stream. (Plus if the dollar inflates/deflates or we change currency from dollar to bc I’m still getting paid from my property which has real value and creates cash flow) what does bc offer?

Ok, maybe I’m overwhelmed by the playing field or do not have enough understanding to arrive at that same conclusion yet but I completely respect where your coming from.

I remember when everyone had blackberries because they were  in smart phones. Then iPhone came out and 3 years later no one used Blackberry. Was it because Blackberry was trying to screw it up? No. The market is unpredictable, Mom will use whatever is most convenient, secure, cheap, quick and a variety of other benefits. Does BC fit that bill?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:11:45
So if you’re betting the hype then it’s just another ��  ehh? Market timing is everything and eventually the bubble will burst.
The problem is if BC is a bubble, which it appears to be. When it bursts then no one will trust the other more technically advanced cryptos. Sounds like roulette to me...only question is how long until the party ends?

But there are an unlimited number of cryptocoins. You and I could start our very own Blockchain currency with a little work. Heck we could even do it correctly and follow securities exchange regulations. So could all 7 billion people on this planet if they follow a few wiki hows. Crypto currencies could become as common as web domains (except there would be no market for them if they were that common, unlike web domains which have multiple revenue streams and purposes to exist without a revenue stream).
