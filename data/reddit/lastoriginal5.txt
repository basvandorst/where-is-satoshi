10% is way too high. I've seen 6-7% which isn't terrible. I personally think more ATMS should be out there. more ATMS = more influence. IMO

Think the rain damaged it yet?
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:17:03
I'm not worried! the fact it got to 13.8k in such a short period of time shows enough strength in my eyes!
@_date: 2019-07-26 05:19:31
what are your fees for buying BTC from fiat?
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:37:57
I'm talking about USD to BTC or others
@_date: 2019-07-26 05:15:23
What trading account was used? Did you make a gain when trading between coins?
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:17:07
1 million percent. I don't think many governments will enjoy what these new tax scares will do. Only going to push the price up
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:23:33
What exchange doesn't use KYC then?

It went green and we went down too lol
@_date: 2019-08-24 06:33:48
If a recession happens people WILL sell every asset for CASH. People lose jobs or significant cuts in pay. EVERYTHING will go on sale. Then  people will calm down and buy stores of value like Gold/BTC. There may be an issue though. We have to recover somehow for the average person to really buy into Gold/BTC. Face the fact most people don't have savings.  Either way BTC has longterm growth. The thing is we need average people to buy in at lows not just rich people.
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:18:48
What wallet or exchange did  you use?
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:06:32
Just pay the 0%, 15% or 20% on long term gains.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:17:51
I'm guessing this is a recent bug. I've seen this more than once today.
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:37:11
6-7 percent
@_date: 2019-08-20 08:05:23
Hodl for a year at least. The IRS is surely a coming. The longer you hold the lower the tax ends up being and the more likely you will pay.
@_date: 2019-08-22 05:54:40
Then they will raise Cap gains and every other tax.

What's amazing is how BNB never dropped in price after these hacks. I think this baby is getting pumped!

The thing people aren't talking about is this Tether/Bitfinex case in NY. Might take down crypto as a whole. Not forever though
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:09:22
Well, he was saying if a single bitcoin is worth Ms. That's super far down the road. If it's not super far down the road the USA dollar is toast and we have hit Venezeulan status. I'm sure some Billionaires aren't criminals.

I've seen Bitcoin arms as low as 6.9%. You can use a debit card on an exchange like Coinbase but expect to pay 5% if you use a debit card. Bank wires are 2% but take a little more time. You can receive coin with your PUBLIC address and send coin with your Private address.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:56:53
Sorry, try a hardware wallet next time, my friend!
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:00:55
Alright, just buy BTC and put it on a hardware wallet for security. Just hold in your case

Introduce them to bitcoin, hopefully they will want to pass down BTC. Put the coins on a cold wallet. And you wait. This is a legal option, but if you want to trade coins in the very near term don't do this.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:12:23
Depends how far in the future. You may live in a totally different government structure. With Sanders in office you will pay far more than you do today.

Canada then apologized. There are no rules in Canada, just suggestions. No consequences, lol.

Keep track on what Congress has been trying to pass. Plus, Yang has said he would have to overhaul entitlements for UBI. 1k a month would add about 1.5 Trillion to the CBO. Congress spent 4.1 T last year and climbing. 23Trillion National debt. Overall US GDP is about 20T. This will destroy the currency and just make everything cost more. Whole thing is dumb. The whole world is aging and fertility rates are dropping = More older people living longer and having less kids. Less kids = lower tax base. Recipe for disaster!
There is a reason places like Monaco, C Islands and Liechtenstein exist. It's where the super rich live when taxes get too high. France tried taxing 75% of everyone making big money. They left. We have to remember there are 190ish other countries we have to compete with.  No borders how do you tax people then?
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:03:30

Are you invested in an index fund? If not, how many individual stocks and what sector? You could list the stocks if you want. 
If you've held these stocks for more than a year SELL! Equities are near ALL TIME HIGHS and the crypto market just entered a new cycle months ago. Half of the trick is when you buy, but the other half is when you sell.
Maybe take a split approach and just take some stock and transfer into crypto. Stay within the top 20 coins.
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:47:50
You know fees that you incur while buying bitcoins are tax deductible
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:54:41
So, all good?

They will eventually, but I still think people will try to get cash asap to pay bills and food.
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:31:56
A few things come to mind. First, how much have you made in the entire year. If the trades are within 365 days then it's taxed as regular income.
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:14:02
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:20:56
Of course! Or spend another 4 dollars on a Starbucks coffee. which do you choose?

I feel so bad for him! We could tell the market was stalling hard around 2016. Plus we can see the world trying to get away from the USD as the reserve currency. We are going to have tough times in the future.

Lol, looks sketch

What's going to be interesting is to find out how much money is spent on imports. Families usually buy imported products,so how much is really being saved. Average inflation is about 4% (so they say). It's going to be a real work of art paying our UBI, SSN and other benefits with a 4% increase payout year over year.
We do spend more than what's known. Somehow Ben Bernanke admitted the FED has "misplaced" 9 Trillion dollars. 
Inflation is indirect taxation. Even If Yang doesn't get in office the currency is well on it's way to being destroyed. How could people live on a yearly income of 4000 dollars decades ago, but now the thought is laughable. 
As the currency inflates people will naturally vote for government programs which will eventually hasten the end. No way is reform coming in the future. Noone wants to get rid of their goodie bag. Classic case of listening to a doctor vs a candyman. The end is coming brace yourself. Who benefits the most from raising taxes? Does a Vat tax work on someone who isn't a citizen? You've missed the point. Vat is a tax towards consumers

Don't get me wrong. It's not personal. I wish we could have all these things and I like Yang as an individual. Working against the largest corporation in the world US Gov is not going to happen.
