1) those who are wiring money don't care about fees in wire transfers
2) it takes a long time for ACH transfers. In situations like the last two weeks, being able to have money almost instantly is a huge advantage. I've sent transfers at 2 am PST and had the funds in the exchange at 9:30 am PST that same morning.

There are a lot of profitable traders but there is also little incentive for them to tell the world their secrets. If you're successful with one trade, maybe that's luck. If you have an 80% success rate over 100 trades, I would be inclined to believe there is more than luck ( -&gt; knowledge ).

That won't work because 1) the wallet is wallet.v1 and 2) the reason he doesn't have the private key is because the app itself doesn't store the wallet for a restore, instead it's stored in iCloud data. He likely created a backup after he already had lost the private keys.

Fiat in Coinbase is FDIC, **NOT** crypto.
Literally says this on Coinbases' website:
"Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. "

Leaving currency on Coinbase is bad because you don't hold the private key. When you don't hold the private key, you aren't in control of the funds. Leaving the crypto in Coinbase means they hold the private key. If Coinbase is hacked, the hacker could get your private key ( because Coinbase holds it ) and take your funds.

From my cali university(which is its own ISP if it matters), I can access both sites fine. No lag on coinbase but slight lag on btc-e.

I know people are heavily against apple here(understandably) but I'm a jailbreak tweak/app developer and I'm making a live icon that displays the value of bitcoin so far from bitcoin average and then you can also set multiple price levels(and for going up or down) and receive notifications. I'll take a look at your code and see if there is anything I can use.

I don't know what you mean by that. The iPhone has one of the sleekest and thinnest shapes on the market not to mention it is lighter then much of the competition(ex the galaxy series). Screen size also isn't everything. The 5s is the best selling phone from AT&amp;T, sprint,Verizon and Tmobile. If screen size was the most important feature the 5s would lose, no argument here. The Galaxy S5's(and prior models) screen is so large that I can't use it comfortably, that's one of my main gripes. 
Another improvement comes from the fact that Apple is in control of the hardware and the software and that allows a lot of great functionality such as memory compression. I don't own a Mac as I prefer Windows but their memory compression with OSX Mavericks is amazing. Just google it and you will find yourself wanting the same technology. The same compression is also used in the iPhone 4 and above on iOS7. That helps the 5s blow out the competition from a technical perspective.
To answer your end question, yes they have improved.

This provides a problem. I am also a jailbreak app and tweak developer and would not not trust anything that isn't open source. The problem is then that the creator would not be able to profit from it. A donation page/link is good in theory but really doesn't produce good enough results.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:21:19
Yes. A lot of developers will have their source code public on sites such as github and also have the project up for sale. Insanj is an example of one developer.

At LA Hacks(a hackathon at UCLA), Namecheap gave everyone a free domain. Namecheap is indeed awesome!

I really don't think a typical key logger is known for taking screenshots. What you talk about would probably be better classified as a RAT.

As far as I know, for iOS, reviews restart when a new version is published. Thus, the iOS version could have been more recently updated.

You said he was selfish in your original comment. The only way the outcome would be a benefit for him ( fulfilling the selfish behavior ) is if he did steal the coins.

I'd like to hear the multiple reasons as to why he was selfish.

shit....you're right. For anyone else wondering, they hold 1% of the supply of bitcoins.

Both the father and OP are in control of the coins. If the father really believes OP would just steal the money at some point later on, he can move the currency to a wallet that he owns.

I sent in my underwear but they still couldn't verify my DOB!

This is cool. I'm gonna give it a shot assuming I can get everything working without going through GDAX/CoinBase.

I purchased through CB using my college checking account with a greater amount and the transaction went through fine after two days. Were you doing the method for instant coins? From what I've read in the articles xclusiv3 posted, CB does a good job at resolving the problems even though it seems like the problems happen a lot.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:31:54
It took me &lt;1 day to get verified through coinbase yesterday.

what happens if someone like Apostolate redeems their karma? 
Could anyone help me set my account up w/ reddit. I sent a PM to bitcointip, but how does it get my wallets address? As in I created a wallet already, but it seems to have given me one too.

I learned the barrier of entry is a lot higher than any other currency, in my opinion. I have put in countless hours just to understand the whole jist and I still find myself needing topics to be ELI5. I want bitcoins to succeed but for a typical internet user this is not a simple topic.I think this goes back to the fact that bitcoin is more than just a currency, it is a technology.The most prominent thing I've seen from this subreddit is that no one is an expert, and so far I've seen no one claiming to be one(though I am a relatively new user). Everyday I see topics I've never seen before and people are genuinely interested in helping you learn more. You have people like bitcoinbillionaire(and others who tip for that matter)that are actively contributing to this subreddit in ways never imagined before.
On the negative, I've seen lots of "scams" and shady business going on for lack of better words. It seems that people are heavily taking advantage of bitcoin user in exeperience and are making great profit in doing so. I mean just today alone you have AmazonBitcoins.net, butterfly labs(not confirmed, purely speculation) among countless other places that are believed to be scam places. When I look at the front page, it seems like 30% of the content is because of people being taken advantage of and this scares me.
 I can post more about what I've learned but this is what has been inside my head currently!

Definitely check this chat out! I'm new to bitcoins and chickenbaconsupreme and the various others in the chat were extremely helpful in the furthering of my bitcoin knowledge.

I'm pretty sure many people would be willing to "lose"/delete their reddit account just to make an easy profit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:00:43
I heard that from a friend too(at least in regards to bitstamp). I haven't tried any other exchanges but getting an account set up at CB was really easy. Could the price difference be accredited to a convenience fee?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:06:13
Someone is going to get scammed either way by doing this trade via PayPal. I would advise against buying.

There are many ways to purchase bitcoins online but I don't know of any service that lets you do it anonymously. For example, I had to connect my bank account to coinbase in order to purchase bitcoins and my bank account was verified in less than 10 minutes. The closest way to being anonymous would be to use cash and purchase locally. There are a decent amount of exchanges so please correct my if my information needs updating.
