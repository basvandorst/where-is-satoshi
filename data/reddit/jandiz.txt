Hey Mike! Thank YOU guys for being so awesome. I'm not sure what my order number is, because it hasn't seemed to go through to payment yet. I got an email at 3:00 pm EST saying the order is processing, etc., etc., but no follow up invoice since.
Thanks for the help! 
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:08:17
Dum dum dum. I don't use coinbase, so I'm waiting on a manual invoice. Say's the order will be processed within 20 minutes. Here's to hoping I'm not too late! I can only imagine how flooded you must be with activity.
**Edit**: Because you guys have been pretty great at responding to queries here, I figure I'd ask here. My order went in for processing around 40 minutes ago. Should I expect an invoice soon? Just backed up? (i.e. Should I make myself some lunch? =P)
**Edit 2** It came! After some wait, which was to be expected during Toronto rush hour, I gots me a large Pizza Hut Cheese! Thanks guys. There was also some mix-up with Canadian orders needing to pay by credit-card upon delivery, but SnapCard was proactive, and sent me an email explaining it, and offered to cancel the order and reimburse me 15$ for the trouble, or send me 25$ of bitcoin to reimburse the 'Za. I went for the latter, and am now content with my pizza and BTC which both came without any issues. Thanks guys!

give a shout, and see what they can work out.
Just on this thread, someone mis-sent 100$, and they worked it out. 
Good luck though!

Role call. I've also invested over at Havelock. So far I've had a great experience with them. Simple interface and layout, no fees, no trouble getting BTC in/out.
I put about 10 BTC into VirtEx. It's really the main exchange in the Canadian field; and I see it doing well with this surge in popularity, yhey seem capable of dealing with scale issues if/when the Canadian market grows.

Data collection is always useful, both for those working with it, and those providing it! Thanks for the survey, I took some value from it: had to stop and introspect my own thinking for a second.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:34:05
You can't kick yourself in the ass over it. It's hard to guess the future. The only thing to do is be happy at what gains you HAVE made.
...And then commit to moving as much capital as you can into bitcoins before it reaches 1,000

This is the kind of action which gives me warm-tingly's. Kudos to you for your initiative, it's an inspiration to us all. Good luck!

Or, alternatively, perhaps don't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:39:23
I don't doubt that your reasons don't stem from personal greed (you probably wouldn't be posting for advice if that truly was the case), and I can definitely appreciate the appeal of the possibility of somehow coming out of the summer with a few extra grand available for the family. All the same, while a buffer is nice and all, gambling on savings which have a need and purpose is NOT the way to go about doing it. Feel free to correct me for guessing; but that 20 grand probably got tucked away by your mom for the family, in case something happened, it would be there in a time of need. That time of need seems to be at hand, and I think it would be insulting to your mom to risk it so.
At the end of the day I *am* just a stranger on the internet though. Do as you will.

I'd rather not wait weeks for delivery. I was actually thinking of dropping by his office in the morning, and if there was something I could print off it would be great.

"More recently I chose to delay adding the address due to the current Bitcoin hype, with prices well over USD 200 - I didn't want GIMP to appear like an opportunist who's just after quick money. **Prices are now returning to sane levels**, and stability in regard to exchange rates seems to return as well."
Great to see that 100+$/BTC is now being considered a norm, when a month ago they WERE the "bubble".

It was the wine in centilitres that did it for me

Which as far as I can see, can only be a good thing for Bitcoin adoption in the end. The Fed is taking up the gamut of getting both merchants and the public to accept MintChip. That's millions of dollars of PR pushing digital currency and all the benefits it entails: fast, convenient, cheap, secure.
Once you have merchants and a public that's sold on those points, I expect there would be much less hesitation in taking Bitcoin seriously when they start hearing more and more rumblings about it.

He knows about it (I do hope he did actually read my paper...), I just have no idea if he's heard of it since/gone about learning more since. So I'd like to somehow give him a paper wallet which SOMEHOW only he can know the pass for.

Sometime I wonder if the collective bubblespeakers have ever heard of self-fulfilling prophecy. Keep posting pictures of your bubble, and you'll find it wherever you want. The rest of us will go on with our lives.
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:37:36
For the sake of trying to keep calm, could we not just initiate a ~1$ trade once a year? For someone who has any XBT whatsoever, all you need to do is send a buck's worth over and trade it into CAD (and retrade a WHOLE DOLLARS WORTH back at market price for a tiny loss if you want to be dramatic).
This doesn't seem to be that hard to me. That being said; I haven't talked to Virtex support whether or not this would satisfy their script requirements, but I don't see why it wouldn't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:34:13
Think of it like pretty much anything else you do with bitcoins. You can't beat yourself up for what didn't end up happening. Live on my friend, live on!

The three day delay is for direct deposits
I can't find it now, but they had mentioned recently that they've begun to process cash payments three times a day, something like 9am, 2pm, and 7pm MST.

You're young, and if the 20 grand was yours, losing it would be something you could recover from. Even if it you were fronted it, 20 grand of debt is nothing new to many college students, and you would have the time you need to eventually pay it off.
But it's not yours. It's your god danm mom's. And she has a real and pertinent need for it. Stop thinking about "putting the savings at risk", and start thinking about what you want to do for what it really is: "gambling with your mom's hip surgery. Don't fucking do it.

To clarify: I in no way think you're doing this for personal greed. Money issues hits all too close to home for me, and I can understand wanting that security.
Always glad to give my 2 bitcents. Regardless what you end up doing, I hope it turns out well!
