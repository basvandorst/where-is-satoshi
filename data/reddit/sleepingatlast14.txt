Has anyone experience with Binance?

Thanks for getting back to me. Dumb question coming up : do your weekly buys amounts change based on high / low rate or they remain the same? And aren't the transaction fees a problem?

Likely a dumb question, bear with me: there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies, many of which have a small marketcap and a unit price inferior to $1. Obviously each of them should be researched before investing, but is it a sound investment method to buy let's say $50 worth of each?

It keeps going down as we speak 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:16:16
Tell us more?

Could you elaborate on 4), DCA in crypto?

May I ask if you could explain this part? Does this mean it will not be subject to inflation like traditional currencies because there will not be any introductions of new cash? Will it lose value then, or increase value only based on speculation?

Hey man, I was looking for feedback on Binance. I actually just signed up, transferred some BTC from Coinbase and did a trade. How has it been so far for you? What is the transaction fee with withdrawal? Can you withdraw to an offline wallet? And can you buy BTC from Binance actually?

Waiting until it starts going up again?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:56:52
Can it hold all cryptocurrencies, and what happens if you lose it? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:23:15
Great that my wire transfer is somewhere in limbo...

Does GDAX carry most/all crypto-currencies?

What does ATH stand for?
EDIT: all time high. Never mind :)

I had the exact same situation. I saw it rise and didn't dare to get in. It was at 9k when I finally built the courage. By the time my transfer was approved and I could buy it was at 15k... I monitored the dip now and bought around 13k again thinking that was the end of the dip, but of course I was too fast. I guess it's a learning experience...

Excuse the naive question, but has there ever been reports of theft on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:36:53
Do you anticipate the dip to continue?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:56:41
Can you buy in smaller denominations than 1?
