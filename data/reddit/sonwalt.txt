I do not think that history may be copied so roughly. History repeats, but it still repeats in different way. People thought in those days that money was equivalent to gold. Nobody cherishes such a delusion today. Money has value because the emitter is held in respect. That is all.
Friedrich Hayek thought that competition of private currencies was necessary for robust economy. That is why cyber currencies are the very experiment in Hayek’s spirit when currencies can compete and evolve like natural species. I think that the situation will be different from that of the beginning of the century. There will be a few currency families which will try to become ideal means of payment. Bitcoin with forks, NXT, Cryptonote-based currencies (Bytecoin, Quazar), etc. They will compete with each other and with fiat currencies. The most adapted currency will survive.

 Banks need not to be in this business. The Internet and cryptocurrency technologies are already here. Bytecoin exists for two years without any safety problems, which proves the reliability of the underlying Cryptonote technology. In any case, the source codes are open so the banks can test it themselves. So, we can say that the launch of own cryptocurrency depends more on marketing than on technologies.

Maybe, I did not deal with Bytecoin at the time of its making. But Hayek’s ideas are not a secret, they are quite popular. I think that many strong crypto currencies were made under the influence of his ideas. Those were real crypto currencies. But returning to the subject of competition among currencies which are backed by trust (in president, country, cryptoalgorithm) will be very interesting. I advise taking a front-row seat.
