Your right.  Stable as in we might not dip anytime soon again. It looked like btc is going up slowly. Organically increasing, rather then getting pumped. I feel like that rise to 20k, was too fast.

Wont fall anytime soon

Good luck. Don't put all your eggs in one jar tho, find a couple coins you like. And don't day trade, just hodl. 
The biggest lesson I learned was, don't f'ing daytrade.

The beat req to it. Lool. Hopefully REQ team will work harder now, and bring us a game changer.

Lmaoo. Has no idea what he's talking about.

So pointless, you can say this about anyone and with any coin.

I think my cousin might have a time machine you can borrow. He's  probably  gonna charge you 1BTC tho,  and it night not send you to the right place. You can take the risk.

Dont jinx it please.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:52:32
Don't worry about the 1btc, we can sneak into his basement, and just use his machine, but by the time he finds out, we'll be long gone. Just give me like $1500.

Never mentioned ALtcoins. But even then coins like LTC I am starting to not see it as a regular altcoin. Same with NEO=platform like ETH. 
Basically bitcoin isnt the only option. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:53:10
I like where we're at. Stable
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:57:38
Man, I don't think you are serious about the time machine. What are you doing in crypto if you cant take risks. My cousin helped guys like  Charlie Shrem and the Winklevoss twins, go back into the past n they invested in bitcoin. Think about it, you could be a billionaire in the future which is now
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:45:09
Theres some buyers, that will pay directly with bitcoin nowadays.

250 profit.... 
$750 altogether 
500 divided by 8,000.... 
You'll have 0.0625 BTC... 
Multiply 0.0625 by 12,000.... 
You get $750
Please don't do any trading either if you can't calculate something like this, you will lose your money in a day.
Just buy btc and hodl it
