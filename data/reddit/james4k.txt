What does this do other than put your coinbase payment form and your twitter handle on the same page..?

Ah, you're absolutely right. Still the problem of trust with issued keys. :(

You would still have to trust the centralized counting of votes without a blockchain, or am I missing something?
Edit: The big problem in either case is that we would need trustless identity verification.

Can you elaborate? From a short look, it seems the transaction just has a reference to data stored by coinprism?

Whew. For a second I thought this was bitcoin.org

Well, first you must send your money to Dwolla. Last time I tried, it was your typical bank transfer.

In theory, you can compress the blockchain's old transaction data by aggregating those with common addresses into single transactions, but how you do this is another discussion. I would imagine mining could be involved in this process, the point being to reach a collective consensus, but who knows how you would reward this.
I haven't looked, but I'm sure there are lots of discussions on this in the bitcoin dev community (not sure where exactly).

Yeah..but only some fraction of those readers probably check reddit frequently.

What happened? I was payed back months ago.

Whoa, now...it's worth about $150k, not $270k. But yeah, still a nice gamble.

The problem is, in 5 years most of these words will probably fade out of use completely. I mean, they just came into existence in the last 5 years.

Are these sites not against the Steam TOS?

Oh, ok. I hadn't read that he bought some below 25.
