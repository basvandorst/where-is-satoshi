The animation was done in Adobe After Effects CS6, but some asset creation was done in Adobe Illustrator CS6 or Photoshop

Dude, I got a dell!

I paid $10.50 in bitcoin to get a professional voice over to narrate [my animation about Bitcoin]( I think it was a steal!

Again, I'm no pro on the subject, but from what I understand, it may be true that Bitcoin is currently the ultimate *currency*, but altcoins can be used for [different purposes]( which is what I got out of Andreas' talk. Without competitors, the tech might not improve at such a great rate. Gavin mentions that, although they aren't necessarily needed right now, they certainly could have a future in a realm other than currency.

Thanks. I hired [a guy]( on Fiverr to read it for $10.50 (paid with Bitcoin)

lol, yeah I made it after watching the video mentioned ( by Andreas. I'm not extensively knowledgeable about altcoins or bitcoin for that matter, which is why you might see one that is deemed "useless" or out dated. I wanted to make it about Bitcoin, but I didn't know which direction to take it - but nobody gave me suggestions in that earlier post, so the content might not be the most accurate.

Here's the link to the talk this was based off of:

Well, value is kind of subjective, but I don't want to continue this argument - I agree that Bitcoin is extremely valuable and sidechain technology is innovative. Thank you for your compliment and collaboration is welcome. I'll keep you in mind.

Thanks. I made this in Adobe After Effects. It took quite a few hours, I'm still learning the software.

Thanks. I think many people would disagree with you about altcoins and I think the video is more about the revolutionary open technology. Also, I worked hard on it so I'm going to share it with people.

Cool, thanks :)
