They said the investigation still continues. No one can leap to conclusions and say that it was Russians who did it, nor that a billion passwords were stolen.  
  
Those who claim a billion passwords were stolen are probably trying to convert "gigbytes" into an estimation that most of the public would be able to understand.  
  
Why are some people trying to leap to a conclusion?

If someone successfully paid you, it means that the network is processing transactions. If transactions are being processed, Bitcoin is working properly and there is no need to worry about backups or transaction reversals of any kind (unless the dispute is between you and the other party, in which case it has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself).  
  
In regard to "old backups", the United States might have been able to prevent the Great Depression if such a backup mechanism existed after the economy went to shit in 1929. In fact, that crisis was caused by major bank failures, crashing stock markets, and the Federal Reserve's manipulation of the money supply – all of which reinforce the need for Bitcoin.

I had this very same idea some time ago.  
  
Like you said, their sign would state in some way that they are setup to receive Bitcoin. The QR code could either be displayed on their sign, or the homeless could be provided with a laminated QR code of their public address. The problem with this is third-party private key access/ownership because it is generated by someone other than the homeless individual. If an organized project to convert the homeless to Bitcoin becomes a large-scale effort, then how can one ensure the security of these private keys? If such an organization was established across the country/world it would require oversight or structure. Someone (person A) could print out a public QR of their own private address and then give it to however many homeless people they want – all the Bitcoin that is sent to the homeless would find its way back to person A's wallet. Imagine what sadness would arise when the interested and hopeful homeless person accesses a computer only to find that all the coins were stolen. This would be bad in many ways.  
  
Another issue is computer access. Maybe they could go to a public library which has accessible computers; they could make the trip as often as permitting (maybe once a week). Or they could be advised to hodl, for the price may increase and their hodling will pay off greater. Nevertheless, securing their wallets is most important. They should be the only ones in control of the private keys.  
  
A new platform may need to be created, such as software designed specifically for simplified offline key generation and wallet access/sweeping. The software could be handed out as a live-CD or a dedicated computer/device could be safely installed in common areas.  
  
In the end, what would they do with the bitcoins? They most likely don't have a smartphone, so making purchases at physical locations wouldn't be convenient at all. Exchanging their coins for fiat would only be possible if done with cash in person. This could be achieved in an organized fashion with the help of participating members. It would run similar to LocalBitcoins, except the organization's members would periodically visit areas or specific homeless individuals to pick up their Bitcoins in exchange for cash.  
  
There's a lot more to explore with this idea.

Right, Breadwallet is great for the "average n00b". I used it myself for some time. Real smooth and easy to use. But like I said, AirBitz offers more and I dare you to argue. All wallets are welcome because we are all in this together. Personally, I wish I used AirBitz earlier because I wouldn't need to readjust. Getting too comfortable with a simple wallet is the very reason I have a hard time getting adjusted to something a tad bit more advanced. On the other hand AirBitz is easier to use than Yelp... and nobody has a hard time using that.

I don't think you understand the significance of a distributed system like Bitcoin. You can't "ban" it. At most, you can flap your finger in protest and hope someone listens to you. What can possibly be banned? The internet? Freedom of choice? Protection from tyranny? Financial security?  Innovation? Worldwide production and use of mining hardware?  ...? If so, you might be on the wrong side of history.  
  
Bitcoin can't be regulated. Not because it's meant to be chaotic, but rather because it inherently regulates itself. You're referring to the regulation of *people* who use Bitcoin, in which case banks should not be involved.

The Bible was a misinterpretation of events that occurred and things that were said. It was reinterpreted to suit the interests of kings and rewritten at least 100+ times. Jesus was probably a Jewish rebel against the corrupt elders. They tortured him and hung him on a cross as an example for others who want to be rebellious. They were the first to scramble his message of love, courage, and doing what's right despite corruption and oppression . Over time, they turned it into a religious deadend of idolatry and church donations.

The more I think about AirBitz, the more I wonder why it isn't the leading wallet app. It's more advanced and it offers more features than any other wallet.

If they wanted to, they would do this by spinning an intricate web of smaller moves, seemingly insignificant, to capture the free market and to take over as many strings that control the Bitcoin system. That's generally how it was done in the past. It's a game of chess, but this time they're up against a massive global pool of cross-disciplined genius, whereas previously the public was out of the loop and easily fooled from behind closed doors. No authority can subvert the people in order to take over the system because the people control the pillars. Nor can the system run without the people's support, so any unfavorable changes will immediately cause undesirable consequences. This system favors cooperation over competition, and it has much greater potential than any before it.

Hmm... how can your identity be stolen if you don't artificially create one? There is nothing to steal as long as you take care of your private keys. The blockchain allows secure storage/logging of important and personal information without the need to attach your private identity. The status quo system requires identity verification of all kinds because it is archaic, vague and vulnerable, which makes it a playground for criminals and authorities whose only task is to uphold the never-ending episode of Tom &amp; Jerry. They do not see an alternative because they are completely immersed in the struggle against quotidian chaos, which happens to be bred and sustained by the status quo itself. Anyway, I think it's unnecessary to try to collect and securely store sensitive biometric data on every individual. The risk of identity theft could be much worse than ever before, especially if people create centralized data firms that store and sell sensitive biometric profiles of people off the blockchain. You don't need to use a palm print or retina scan to unlock a door, rent a car, or board a flight. A cryptographic ID key of some sort would suffice, but nobody would be issued or have in possession more than one key at any given moment. Although the key would not contain sensitive or personal data, anyone can easily reissue a new one at anytime if they feel like their security or privacy was compromised in any way. It could be issued in the form of a QR tattoo, a wireless read-only chip such as NFC embedded in your finger tip, or something else that has yet to be invented. Two or three of these combined would be better.
Intrusive identity verification systems are highly demanded by the status quo because false documents are increasingly easier to make and exponentially harder to curb using old technologies/tactics. The blockchain eliminates counterfeiting, tampering or manipulating records, revealing and stealing sensitive/private information, leaks, hacks, etc. Thus, invasive ID technologies are unnecessary. If need be, they should only be utilized by entities that require special clearances, or special surveillance. But humans are imperfect and prone to error, so I do not condone any authoritative system based upon centralized human judgement against other error-prone humans.

"Being from Google" is the core concept of my argument. It's an API, I get that, but this doesn't change the fact that Google has it's own hidden agenda that does not correspond with the principles of decentralization and distributed power. They are not outright in support of Bitcoin, like other tech giants, because they want their power and influence to carry over into the Bitcoin space.  
  
Google is notorious for surveillance on the internet. They collect enormous amounts of data about unsuspecting internet users, in very clever ways, and then do who knows what with it. I suspect that they seek to funnel the flow of Bitcoin's data through their own servers with the goal of building an identity tracking system based on IP and other goodies. You give an inch and they'll take as much as possible without your knowledge. This API might be that inch, so be mindful of all things.

Google Wallet is still a competitor to Bitcoin (in some sense), and they do not state their intentions clearly enough. Don't be quick to jump on the back of dinosaurs for their species is not equipped to survive a meteor strike. Despite Bitcoin's seemingly slow growth, it is completely self-sufficient; a quality that must be preserved. A slow build-up is better than a sell out for popularity. Even if they wanted to be at some point, Google is not a privacy-centric corporation... quite the opposite actually. On the other hand, Bitcoin is immune to that system of coercion. Corporations and banks can leech onto Bitcon's rear-end to offer people goods and services if they so wish, but they should not be given any special treatment. Why? Well, imagine what would happen if Google created a closed-source, privacy-infringing Bitcoin wallet and advertised it to the mainstream population? A coup/hijack/51% attack on mainstream adoption. Possible, but unlikely.

No, it only threatens the spending of those taxes. Tax collection could be made as simple as clicking a button. For example, a program can be created that pulls the .CSV which contains all of your transactions and then it generates a form that gets sent to the IRS. No more "tax season". Anyone can see where those taxes end up and how they get spent. No more tax corruption. You can still choose to evade the system, like you would do with cash, but governments should not have that choice. If some of those taxes pass through a mixer then I would stop paying them too. Likewise if some of it lands in an unknown wallet, I would expect a full investigation.
