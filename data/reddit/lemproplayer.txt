A $500,000 house sold at a bitcoin price of 470. Assuming the house was actually sold for 500,000 he would have 1063.83 bitcoins. At the current price those bitcoins are worth over 8 million dollars. Good investment if I had to say

I wish I wasn’t a broke highschool student, I told my dad to invest at 5.5kand he didn’t, would have doubled his investment in less that half a year would have been able to retire by now

Hello gay boi from Sweden

Well we don't know wether it'll be illegal in the future but it's a hell of an investment right now so there is value, but say in a year or too it's banned and you haven't pulled out at best you can try and sell it but you might just loose everything if it's illegal

It's a non renewable resource tho, you can grow more food but you can't grow more oil

And to think I could have gotten 3 bitcoin for my csgo knife from 4 years ago
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:20:01
Oh, I didn't know that and it was one of the reasons I didn't want to invest I thought mbtc was the lowest divisible number, if this helly blows up this could be like anew world currency that would be amazing to get in super early
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:57:50
I also have another question tho, if bitcoin starts taking over, wouldn't governments start losing power? The world would turn to chaos 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:13:37
Oh I didn't know that
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:50:03
I mean it could end up similarly but just last longer I mean if there isn't enough bitcoin for everyone in the world to use it as financial backing the price has to go down, ofc it could do the opposite and and just do even better

This graph is not linear and it's triggering
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:50:28
I'm saying if it's outlawed in the future
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:52:05
I supposed but will mainstream audiences buy .000000001 bitcoin for 100 is it ever comes to that point
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:59:31
I don't get the whole bitcoin vs stocks both have benefits and draw backs I mean the Dow has been hitting record highs past month... I do however understand that there is a bit of a war between bitcoin die hards and stock brokers 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:12:10
But that's what I'm saying in the future a mbtc might be worth $100 what if I just wanted some Taco Bell am I just give away the rest of the mbtc or can I keep it I don't know these things but I would assume main stream audiences don't want to have to deal with getting 9/10 of a mbtc back in change at Taco Bell
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:04:57
Yea but you can't get 1/10 of a penny back, if bitcoin keeps going where it's going that's how it's gonna be for mbtc 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:07:28
That would be something but gov makes money off taxes and since bitcoin is unregulated there are no taxes right?
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:33:13
Open market independent sellers = illegal???? 
I thought this was america
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:00:07
Oh that's right wall streets in niger my fault dude
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:37:32
Is the article not about an American place?
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:42:42
This is backed only by that tho, money is backed by the gov, but shit if you wanna buy my bitcoin I'll buy yours
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:36:53
I mean if governments outlaw crypto currency won't the price plummet? Idk if this is even legal tho. At the same time who's to say people give up on it. Really hope they don't just put a lot of my money in this
