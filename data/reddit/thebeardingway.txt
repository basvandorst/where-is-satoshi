Of course it's going to have hubs. The number of connections nodes will have will follow a power law. There's nothing anyone can do to prevent that without crippling the network. But it's not going to be a problem because it's trivial to open channels to route around a node if a hub becomes a problem.

Not really silent. Whatever your attitude towards inflation, it has been public policy for a long time.

Yes I read it. I still don't get it. They misplaced money far in excess of their budget. The DoD budget is ca. 500 billion and they are misplacing in excess of a trillion a year. How could they overspend by so much when they didn't even have the money? Are they borrowing it? Is there some accounting principle I don't understand?

That number makes no sense. That's how much the total cumulative US debt is, and one department "lost" that in a year? There's a lot more to this story.

I long ago ran out of money to buy the dip. I've resorted to selling and putting a good trailing stop on to accumulate more.

Manipulation? This is called correlation. Price is a reflection of what the market thinks a thing is valued. The cryptos have tight correlation right now because the reality is that most don't provide much difference in a value proposition from bitcoin. Yes of course they claim to present a different value proposition. But, the reality is, the primary use case for all cryptos is store of value and speculation. Until some of these products start delivering on their promises that differentiate them from bitcoin, they will remain highly correlated.

Freudian slip implies it's some kind of secret. It's pretty much a well known thing that the US benefits from control over the dollar. Whether it's for managing the economy or leverage in international negotiations.

When zimbabwe prints a 1 trillion note that doesn't make the dollar worth less.
People can make infinite alt coins but there is only a market for a small number that can be used as a store of value. Arguably bitcoin is the only 'store of value' coin at the moment.

In the sense that It has regular boom and bust cycles it is like the industrial revolution. In the 1800s they averaged one panic every 20 years. Bitcoin has one every year. So it's like the industrial revolution on a hyper accelerated fast track.

I thought GPU mining no longer cost effective compared to ASIC mining. Clearly I misunderstood... what kind of mining is driving this?

I'm numb to it. Bitcoin has taken so many body blows and it keeps going I just don't care anymore. I just keep my eye out for truly catastrophic events.

Eh, it can happen to people that are wealthy too. Rich people have to pawn expensive stuff sometimes because their money is locked up in assets that they can't liquidate for various reasons (like the market being way down) or their cash flow sees an interruption, but they still need to make their payroll or something.
