For future reference:
**All reputable exchanges should publish all public keys of their cold-wallets.**
This way the wallet stays securely offline but the public has the exact knowledge about the hard-backing of the exchange.
**Bitcoin was specifically designed for the purpose of financial transparency and verification of accounts by the public.**

I vote Ripple with my BTC. It seems most of the Bitcoin devs have been sucked into the world of politics rather than robustly deal with structural and technical issues.
This process has been going for almost a year now and in the current situation IMHO BTC is overvalued at least 50% if not more. I choose a system that works instead the one that just might, some day. Unfortunately Bitcoin is dying like a plant without fresh water.

You are wrong. As a potential seller of BitCoins through PayPal I say he did outbid you. I would rather sell to him than to you, unless you can bid an even higher price than $6.10
Don't you know how auction system works? The prize goes to the highest bidder, how can you not see that?

Revolut has no actual cryptocurrencies - it's just a casino where you pretend to buy/sell things valued as if they were actual cryptocurrencies - it's for pure speculation about the price with no connection to the real market.

USD and any government money is worth something because creditors believe that the government is able to force you to cough up the money in taxes for which you first have to work hard. So yeah, government money is backed - it is backed by your sweat... and blood if you do not listen to the guy at the other side of the barrel of the gun.
BTC is backed by the faith that people can ignore the banks and the governments. Sometimes they can, most of the time they cannot - you decide who has more chances in the current world.

When I complained to support about huge lag and orders not cancelling which resulted in direct financial loss on my part the Mt.Gox team bluntly said they won't refund transaction fees because they were already processed. O_o WTF Gox?!
1. Be the first Bitcoin exchange
2. Provide low quality of service
3. Charge high, non-refundable fees
4. Don't listen to community feedback
5. ???
6. PROFIT !!!
It seems Mt.Gox acquired "wall-street bank mentality" in no time.
I moved all my money out of there.
