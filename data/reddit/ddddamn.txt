Arranged marriages are still a common thing in other cultures.

mind expanding on this? I actually just bought some because I actually read up on forks and realized I didn't really understand what would happen until now. 
Before that I was considering investing in litecoin or ethereum or ripple since their prices are much lower now but bitcoin seems to be the main one so..

I think it's unfair to compare a whole new form of currency to the cpu that's sitting in my laptop.

LOL if only your perfect standard of marriage held up in the real world. Sorry but you don't know his situation or background. Not everyone has the luxury to marry someone they can completely trust with anything and everything. Not to mention even if you do people can and do change, especially when large sums of money is involved.
I mean sorry but I just got done reading a bunch of articles a few weeks ago where husbands literally had to fake their deaths because their longtime spouses had hired hitmen to murder them. Unless you are both super grounded, a lot of different factors can build up and destroy what started out as a strong, healthy marriage. It's not anyone's fault for telling him not to tell her for his own safety.

Shouldn't that be a bit of a cause of worry then?...

Arranged marriages doesn't only happen with poor families...    Anyway I never said he was. I'm saying that it is a possibility because nobody knows him or his situation so being cautious is way better than lecturing him that he's supposed to be able to share everything with his wife.

And here I was yesterday thinking I should wait for a dip before buying. Sigh.
