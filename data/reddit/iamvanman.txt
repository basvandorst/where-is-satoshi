I called now and they gave me the same speel said "gambling" is against their terms and conditions so I asked point blank "you're telling me that I can't go to the gas station right now and purchase a lottery ticket or scratch off?" And she kept giving me the work around coming back to Bitcoin so I asked for a yes or no answer point blank and she said "yes" so.. I guess anyone using their debit card to purchase scratch offs or lottery tickets has broken their terms and conditions!

I actually just worked in China on a 1 year contract and requested to be paid in BTC. It has worked out to say the least.

Awesome thank you!

We can't roll over though, it needs to be known that this isn't acceptable. I mean there's something to be said about Visa vs an actual Debit  Visa but either way.

I will try a transaction later today and find out if it goes through. If not I may have to reconsider my bank of choice. Why can't I pay pills with Bitcoin in Canada yet? ��

I just retried and my card was removed and I can no longer re-add it. "Card no longer supported please contact support"

Yeah e trans tends to work for sure but generally it's not instant verification like a normal debit visa tx.

Yeah I haven't tried the interac e transfer way to be fair but I feel like I shouldn't have to, I should be able to purchase what I want with my money the way the system is meant to be used ���� but moving forward this might be the only option.

You are using a TD debit visa on Coinbase?

It's absolutely unacceptable. I can burn a hundred dollar bill if I really wanted to. Gambling LOL

Those are completely valid points and you are probably right but according to the government of Canada, cryptocurrency is completely legal (and taxable, assuming your honest with the CRA) and most definitely considered closer to an asset than dumb luck on a scratch ticket or at a casino slot machine.

This is very interesting, I am going to look into this, thanks!

Yeah I had been expecting it as well but it's a little frustrating especially when I went to buy in the dip at 8k haha
