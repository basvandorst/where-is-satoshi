I would hate to see people throwing bitcoins away now that I think about it. It would be better to send that to feed starving children or something rather than destroy them. Plus, destroying bitcoins might make the rest of the bitcoins in circulation more valuable. Maybe it would be better if people donated it to the Red Cross here:  I would hate to be responsible for knowingly destroying wealth when lives could be saved with it.

I was actually doing a little bit of research and the 9/11 terrorists extensively used the MS Windows platform during the planning stages of the attack.
It is a bit ironic that Bill Gates is now scrutinizing Bitcoin even though it was not used in any major attack like MS Windows was used in the 9/11 attacks.

$200-2000 It will be useful for micro payments online. I like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for stuff but I wouldn't give someone my credit card or bank information for $1, anytime i have, they sign me up for some bull crap repeat order... they can't do that with bitcoin :)
They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved
It is cheaper than western union and paypal if you convert USD to bitcoin for free.
Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.

wow, i got the money. This experiment could be interesting. It might be the case that people trolling bitcoin would be the ones to bring bitcoin public. I think it would take some significantly large donations to some very rich and powerful people for them to back-off on Bitcoin. That is how it works in politics, finance, economics, law... the people that are making the choices need to be rewarded in order to not hate bitcoin. I know this concept is like a bribe from pro-bitcoiners and a threat from the anti-bitcoiners, but if people that have large amounts of bitcoin allowed some powerful people to purchase bitcoins at a decent price, then it would probably raise the probability for it to go mainstream and probably make it happen more quickly.

It is fragile... possibly destroying enough of them could send it spiraling down just as well. Destroying all of them certainly would make them worthless ;) the closer to zero bitcoins will probably make them less valuable... maybe if only a small portion of bitcoins were destroyed, it would rise the value, but there is probably some number (maybe 70%)... that number might very well be all of the bitcoins or 96% or 37% but destroying enough of them might devalue them as a currency and store of value

@_date: 2015-01-16 21:20:00
But, it will take bitcoins out of circulation and people will be less likely to get them. Very wealthy people that hate Bitcoin could cause swings in the market and buy up all the bitcoins and destroy them. I think if enough of the bitcoins got destroyed, it would cause Bitcoin to be less popular and thus lowering the price so they can buy more to destroy them. It sounds unlikely but it is not impossible for this to happen. It is just a speculative theory, so it is probably wrong.

Agreed. I'm going to try to go through it and make it more concise. I do want to make it so the largest number of people can understand it.

If we get enough people to contribute, then it is very cheap marketing. The trolls will become more effective at telling everybody on the planet all about Bitcoin. Then, they will be familiar with it once they see a Bitcoin ATM and Bitcoin at the checkout of there favorite online and in-store shopping sites. I think this is the only way that Bitcoin is going to go mainstream. We really need to rally up all the trolls and get them to tell the world about Bitcoin!

I think a better way of tipping an article owner is having a built in "tip" icon that is similar to "share" or "like". I, too, don't agree with a tip as a comment and then a reply to the comment that the tip was sent. It would be better as a pop-up box that opens when the icon is clicked on the article header where a user could leave a tip or view the past tips. I can see how many "... just got a tip ..." replies could get annoying very quickly.

I would like to see another decentralized system like Bitcoin for search, social networking or shopping. The network could reward each machine for its' participation in keeping the integrity of the system similar to how Bitcoin does it. This would cut out all the added expenses that the corporations are attaching to them right now.
I think search would be feasible - an agreed upon method to rank pages could be devised. The network would reward each "crawler" that follows the rules by giving them ad space or auctioning off the ad space for Bitcoin. The hosts/crawlers would get the Bitcoin. 
This would cut out the existing search engines and give all that revenue back to the consumers and merchants instead of it all going into the bank accounts of billionaires. That money could be returned to the people with this model.

It looks like GSM phones use SIM cards but CDMA don't. Some Verizon phones don't use SIM cards but I found that they make people verify by text message or if the phone is lost by calling the number:

They should implement a dynamic block size based on the transactions for the past two weeks similar to how the difficulty is handled. This still allows for smaller nodes to participate in the short-term but also allows the network to scale in the long-term. This also makes it so miners get rewards as long as the number of transactions is increasing since the block size will always be a little bit smaller than the number of transactions.

no, the first few percent of companies to accept Bitcoin will lose money early on because of the costs and later companies that accept Bitcoin will make profits as soon as they start accepting it.

I already increased that to 1000. I usually have about 10-15 established connections when I check with netstat.
It is a 1GB RAM server but I added 6GB of swap space which looks like it is not being used:
	[root ~]# free -h
		      total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
	Mem:           988M        755M         73M        260K        159M         84M
	Swap:          6.2G          0B        6.2G
But, it doesn't crash anymore since I added the swap space. I have .bitcoin symlinked to a mounted hard drive with plenty of disk space:
	[root ~]# df -h
	Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
	/dev/xvda1       20G  8.2G   11G  45% /

Once it was fully synced, the node looks like it us running smoothly. I registered at getaddr.bitnodes.io and got an e-mail that said:

Bitcoin will take the power away from the corrupt governments and those corrupt governments will get mad about it and nuke the planet. Some people will live underground in natural and man-made caves until we build the technology to terra-form our planet. We will then use that technology to colonize the universe.

I was thinking the same thing with BTCJam. What if someone borrowed a Bitcoin at $200 and the price rose to $1000 a month later. They might not ever be able to pay it back and if the price keeps rising and the interest keeps accumulating, then a person could technically get sued for  a disproportionately large amount of money a few years down the road. I'm not sure that the courts would consider the debt legitimate though.

Miners make their revenues in Bitcoin from transactions. Any large miner would not even mention of this (let alone pursue this) because it would immediately cause the value of Bitcoin to drop and their profits to drop since they are paid in Bitcoin.

Well, maybe the intention was to protect the large companies from competition and protect the politicians that have stake in those companies. They could have protected the small guy without preventing them from getting/giving investments by other means.

It probably will go below $200 again but it will be very short lived since a lot of people will see it as an opportunity to buy.
$200 for a bitcoin is cheaper than it is to mine.

Businesses that provide free services will make revenue through advertisements and should pay a portion of this revenue to the miners in order to keep the network secure. However, the greedy nature of humankind will suggest that these businesses will not pay the miners unless if they are forced to. Miners will be able to retaliate by not including transactions that don't have fees. If there are miners out there that can make a profit by processing transactions for free (maybe attach an advertisement to the transaction) then that would work.
