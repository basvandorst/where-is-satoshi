But do you sell if you are selling at a loss now?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:13:59
So if I bought at 10k I assume I just hold as long as I can afford to right? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:02:29
It certainly seems like this is the case. Thanks for the thoughtful reply. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:03:47
Chase a check, never chase a bit?
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:20:21
I read amazon will accept shortly. That could be big
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:58:51
Thanks for the advice 
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:27:21
Looks like tax returns are in, huh?
@_date: 2019-06-03 04:51:59
Have you seen this? 
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:34:42
But it seems like the fluctuations are more annual?
@_date: 2019-06-03 04:45:49
Accurate. Except I’m 40, female and I don’t spend it. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 02:18:25
Can someone ELI5 what drives the bitcoin cyclical booms and busts?
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:25:07
Which exchanges have this feature?
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:52:44
Also interested. I run a small full service consulting firm for the web piece specializing in startups. Can price a project for you or say beyond our scope. Send me your email and we can set up a call.

What I mean is that it is unfortunate that so few woman got in early and that most of the wealth generated so far has gone to men. I would be surprised if lambos would be the measure of success here if the gender ratio were reversed. Women tend to spend on their families and their communities. Just saying.

According to this, I should delete Coinbase from my phone and look again in sept. Not bad advice. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:26:33
Also - you haven’t lost the money until you sell it. Until then, it is just invested. Seems the same emotionally, but it is not. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:15:30
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:38:59
Mine is on the way, but how do we know these will not be our undoing again? Can anyone point me to some reassurance? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:35:00
Can you explain like I’m 5 how to add a spread? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:15:35
Can you explain more about this and how you came to this conclusion? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:58:58
That thread made my day. :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:58:54
Why should governments get to decide how much your money is worth when many people can’t choose their leaders or freely move to a different country? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:38:59
Sounds good to me!
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:51:23
Thanks for the advice. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:32:42
Yeah - I get that too
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:04:53
Can someone explain to me why bitcoin won’t quickly be abandoned when it seems like the blockchain tech is being adopted in so many ways but they are not tied to bitcoin? What does big offer that makes everyone believe it will grow for at least several years (on value). Please ELI5
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:29:38
Not for US citizens FYI 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:55:35
I just scroll out on Coinbase to “all” and you see a nice steady growth line with one crazy spike in the middle (where, of course, I bought). Makes the long game look promising. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:03:03
Which wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:49:46
How can CB get away with the high fees? What benefit are they providing?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:54:20
Noob here. They are saying transaction is $1 but why is Coinbase currency exchange so high then? Is this like a credit card with cash vs converting dollars to euros? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:40:58
If only they would Hodl! Could be more like 99.999% :)
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:14:48
This is not the price is right! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:13:11
If you sell BTC on Coinbase and keep the USD in your account and rebuy lower don’t you pay tax on the difference? If higher deduct the loss? Or as long as still invested doesn’t count? I am concerned about trying to ride waves for this reason and am looking for advice. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:23:52
I’d like to learn more about trading. Where do you do that?
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:17:20
This is my understanding as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:54:59
4-6%. That’s a pretty sad range. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:38:12
I’m still up but getting very close to flat. Wondering if you have advice. I believe in the larger vision but also don’t want to be dumb about it. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:11:46
It seems fair to say the spike in the price of bitcoin has turned corporate attention to blockchain - but does corporate use of blockchain impact bitcoins adoption or price? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:12:48
Expensive transaction fees. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:11:16
Just noticed this almost spells lambo if you unscramble it. Coincidence? I think not. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:36:29
It’s more like if you thought your country was going to rise 1000% and could convert to British pounds. Or if you thought it would deflate 1000% and you decide to hold off on all non-essential purchases until they were much cheaper. I think it is a valid concern if you expect a major fluctuation in value - which it looks like is the case with bitcoin. Your answer makes me think you just ignore the fluxes and move forward. Which is fine. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:10:31
What’s the easiest way to learn how to accept it? I have bought but never sent or received.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:09:35
Are you in the hdl camp? Just curious. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:40:30
Literally just checked Coinbase then his tracking site before coming here to watch everyone cry. I should just bookmark it. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:11:28
All this ripping seams exciting but I have no idea what it means or how to do it. I do know how to comment though, so here’s to trying to learn!
@_date: 2019-05-01 04:32:13
Even Forbes does not have an editor reviewing contributor work before it goes live. Times have changed.
