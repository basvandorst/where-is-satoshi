3FA is the only answer.

It's a bit counter-productive to say that *after* the fact, don't you think? I've seen a lot of people blaming the victims of the Mt. Gox shutdown despite it seeming reasonably reputable.


Is there actually any online entity that can be trusted to *not* take your money given the opportunity? For example, I don't trust any of the websites that convert Bitcoins to fiat money, which explains why I still have Bitcoins.


But I can't call on the internet police if my internet money gets stolen. In this example, it seems even *less* safe than paying by cash. 
I appreciate the response but it doesn't make me feel any more inclined to use it. In fact, know that I know that this is the intended behaviour, I feel even more wary about ever using it in the future.

Should I try and reclaim it through SatoshiDice or is it still in my wallet somewhere? I don't know how it managed to move my money around when I typed their address and amount very carefully, given that it's a gambling site and that's what makes me nervous about it.
Thank you for the help though.

Why isn't there a customer support system for Bitcoins, for questions about mysterious transactions or enabling chargebacks for merchants who provide unsatisfactory service?
I still don't know why I was charged [0.014 BTC extra]( for playing SatoshiDice. I stopped using it after that, fearing I'd lose more money.
EDIT: I should also mention that I use both a debit card and Paypal and have made hundreds of payments to dozens of merchants. The one time I did have a ($300) mysterious charge on Paypal, it was reversed within a day. When I decided to spend my mined coins, they're leeched without my permission with zero recourse. Why should someone like me who is concerned about losing money use Bitcoin?

Where are you supposed to store them then in this case? I asked this question yesterday and multiple people told me that giving them to an online bank or exchange was the worst place to store them. I'm legitimately confused on how Bitcoins are supposed to be stored.

One month? It's been in decline for an entire year. Loads of articles have noted it as the worst currency of 2014.
2015 isn't exactly off to a great start now.
