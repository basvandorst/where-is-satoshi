Same.  It would be like losing a credit card.

Nope, not being sarcastic.  The author is saying exactly what you said.  The average user is not going to go to great lengths to cover their tracks, however, it is possible to do so if one wishes, just like cash.

Finally, an intelligent commentary on the true nature of bitcoin anonymity.


@_date: 2011-08-03 03:35:33
Agreed.  I'm dollar-cost-averaged around $15, which is kind of painful at the moment, but I'm in for several thousand dollars.  I will sell when Bruce Wagner announces on the Bitcoin Show that Bitcoins are useless.

Bitcoin isn't a "site," nor is it run out some guy's basement.  Also there is a completely secure client, it's THE client, and it's not centralized.

This is really going to open up the market.  I have to say, the number of developments this week has been tremendous:
- CNN report
- CNBC front page article
- Multiple high quality casinos/gambling sites opened up
- Point-of-Sale device under development
- MtGox/EUR transaction availability
- Articles in several Canadian newspapers
- New exchange (Ruxum)
- uploaded.to accepting BTC

Hey folks.  Just wanted to let you know that I've started a new blog where I plan to discuss everything from daytrading Bitcoin to investing in Bitcoin, Bitcoin projects, and anything I feel the Bitcoin community should know about.  There appears to be a lack of professional Bitcoin blogs, so I'm hoping to fill the gap.  Thanks for visiting.

Every other network currently supporting traditional financial transactions would be equally vulnerable.  No more debit or credit card transactions either.  Bitcoin isn't any worse off.

This is huge (former Citibank exec behind it).
@_date: 2011-07-22 18:28:30
Speculation.  No other way to describe what happened there.
This time around, we're starting to see another price rise which I believe is a combination of speculation and the fact that NMCs are starting to find new applications (see moonco.in), and are now being traded on Ruxum as well.
@_date: 2011-07-21 10:02:01
Good point.  Let's see the address posted to his official website.
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:42:21
What does that prove?  
@_date: 2011-10-15 02:22:59
Awesome, but why did you choose the less popular symbol for Bitcoin?  I would recommend using the one with two vertical lines through it.
@_date: 2011-08-27 18:49:38
I am familiar with the exchange rate, sir, but you started this conversation in USDs.
You said "the seller" cancelled the orders.  Did the seller cancel the orders or did the exchange reverse the orders?  Were you the seller?  You said "I sold" and then you said "The seller," so I have no idea what's going on here.  Ahh forget it, I waste too much time on the Internet.
@_date: 2011-08-21 23:15:47
However, if you tried to buy 45,000 BTC, you would not get them all for a low price. 
@_date: 2011-08-27 14:10:14
If someone bid $20, their order would have been filled by the lowest ask.

Bruce Wagner makes a good point.  How many years did it take for Facebook to go mainstream?  Let's see where Bitcoin is in three or four years.

Seconded. You can send money to virtex via email money transfer and it'll show up in your account within the day, perhaps in under an hour if the staff are around (it's a manual transaction). You're lucky you're in Canada because it's probably one of the easiest places to buy BTC.

Easiest way is to send a bankwire directly to MtGox.  It took 2 hrs for the money to appear in my account.
@_date: 2011-07-14 19:34:32
I've never seen it broken down like this in the mainstream media.
@_date: 2011-08-29 13:05:22
Interesting to see the reactions.  Some people obviously think that you have to mine Bitcoins to be able to use Bitcoins.  They don't understand that you simply (haha) acquire Bitcoins like anything else that you buy.  
Since these players were already using credit cards, they should have bank accounts and be able to buy Bitcoins.
But yes, to the average person who wakes up one day and finds he needs Bitcoins to purchase something he wants, it's not a trivial task to acquire them.  We need those ATMs deployed immediately!

I ALWAYS trade my coins on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange!

A "Point-of-Sale" device, equivalent to the debit/credit card machine you find at a cashier in a store.  This one is for Bitcoin and appears to work by scanning a QR code displayed on a smartphone.

Good job getting them to adopt Bitcoin.  If anything, it will greatly increase exposure to the currency.  Yes, they will eventually figure out that they need a more efficient way to accept Bitcoin donations.

RedMaple (me) can only win what the others bet.  The way the odds are displayed on that site are a little strange.  Right now I'm actually getting 1:3.21, not 3.21:1.  As it stands, the odds are currently better for the "no" side than for my side, even though the chances of me being correct obviously lower.
@_date: 2011-07-23 19:56:24
What if another exchange comes up with a Point-of-Sale system?  Mt. Gox might be the first, but not necessarily the last.  I fully support the advancement of Bitcoin related technologies.

I did it from Canada.  I don't want to say something wrong and screw you up, but I don't see why you wouldn't have to wire the money from a US account as well.

You are correct, sir!

A perfect fit, if I do say so myself.  In the FAQ, it says that after you donate, you have to email them to tell them which film/show you're supporting.  Why don't they just create a different address for each work?  It would save them a tonne of labour.
@_date: 2011-07-05 00:33:41
Also, their "weed" looks a lot like tea.

I'm not surprised to see Hong Kong based businesses starting to adopt Bitcoin.  HK commerce is all about efficiency and globalization.

Would you say that Quantum computing is inevitable, and therefore Bitcoin has a not-too-distant expiry date?  Would it be possible to patch Bitcoin to keep it secure?

Any attempt to "coerce" adoption is not ideal.  Sure, you might convince an establishment or two to accept Bitcoin, but it won't be self-sustaining.
Bitcoin will first be adopted where it fills the greatest need.  I see this primarily being online micro-payments and international money transfers, the first of which is not currently practical and the second, costly and tedious.
Once more and more people adopt Bitcoin for these purposes, and others, businesses in the meatspace will recognize that people have a new, liquid asset, that they might want to use to perform everyday transactions for which they were previously using traditional currencies.  At that point, businesses will naturally want to acquire the ability to accept Bitcoin.  It won't require convincing.
At the moment, it still isn't practical for people to acquire and hold Bitcoin.  This will soon change, first with the secure version of the Bitcoin client, and second with the adoption of Fellow Traveler's "Open Transactions" approach to, firstly, remove all risk of Bitcoin thievery and second, eliminate the need to wait for confirmations.
The infrastructure is still in its infancy.  It will mature greatly over the next year... I don't even think you'll recognize Bitcoin two years from now.  Once the infrastructure is in place, businesses will be begging for point-of-sale devices and probably building their own.

What's with the part of the article where it looks like the writer left placeholders for himself:
"Tells about failed attempts to hack the bitcoin encryption code." 
"Also tells about Kevin Groce, who runs a bitcoin-mining operation in Kentucky."

I wasn't aware of his 25,000 BTC loss - just read about it on the forums this morning.  Which makes my comment, here, quite a coincidence.  I agree that he's not the most technically competent guy in the world, but he understands the potential of the technology. Bitcoin is a solid concept based on mathematical principles, and it works just fine.  People who build poor applications and services around the concept of Bitcoin will come and go, but Bitcoin will continue to exist and chug away.  Eventually, the competent businesses will rise to the top and Bitcoin will become widely adopted.

This is already priced in, and is not a factor.  Anyone who invests in Bitcoin today is assuming that the remaining to-be-mined coins will be snapped up for the same price or more.  The 7200 Bitcoins/day was happening as the price was increasing, as well.  Price is driven by other factors.
@_date: 2011-08-27 04:20:58

As long as the creation of bitcoins and the maintenance of the ledger remain decentralized (which they always will), bitcoins remain decentralized.

Absolutely.  Just grab the Bank Wire info off of the MtGox website, march down to your bank, tell them you want to send x amount and hand them the info that you copied down.  A US bank account is actually the best, because MtGox accepts USD only.
@_date: 2011-07-23 20:07:30
Yup.  Or free phone-sex, or free anything that already existed that you got charged for when making a phone call.  No difference.

If bitcoin was a little more mainstream, you would definitely see it move as a hedge against dollar depreciation.  I can't seem to locate the article that I read yesterday, but it mentioned that a major investment adviser was recommending gold, silver, and for the first time, bitcoin as investments.
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:45:39
Even though this looks sketch-o-rama, it's from a link directly off the MtGox website:

I think the guy is legit.  If you click-through to a purchase, he provides a very in-depth explanation of how the site works.
