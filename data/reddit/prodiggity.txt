relax buddy


uh... A whole lot of people, because it is the canonical example of something being superseded by a competing implementation.

Because most of the world beyond human created systems works in a decentralized way there should be many places to look for inspiration.
A cool idea would be to have the show written in the style of multiple of parallel stories. *Magnolia* and *Crash* were done this way, and there were quite a few 'ensemble cast' type movies of this sort as well.  In those types of movies it is kind of a trope to have a subtle interweaving of the different story lines. For your show you could do the same, but since it is a show about networks and interconnectedness, you could really highlight the interplay between the different stories and use it to tell an additional overarching story.

Can anyone link me to any recent work incorporating Willy into the "Bubble Cycle Thesis"?

Do you have a source for that? Seems like a nice round number that could just be pulled out of the air to try and placate concerns.
I guess what you're trying to say is that 75% of the total hashrate of ghash is not controlled by them. Because counting ghash themselves as one user, the number of users that aren't ghash is obviously more than 75%.
Does anyone know if it is possible to determine what percentage of the ghash pool hashrate is controled by them?

Happy Cakeday mah Badger!

Thanks for the link.
Does anyone know where their datacenters are located?  
And if they or someone else manufacturers their chips?

What are your thoughts on where the tipping functionality of bitcoin could really shine?

It'd be nice if you link to the source, i.e. context, of the quote.
@_date: 2014-06-21 07:19:42
Yeah homonyms exist. What about the phrase *'bits' are made of bits*?
That's one of the key issues here, and a little more of a head scratcher than your examples.

What can conceivably be done without radically altering bitcoin in a way that might make it difficult to achieve consensus on the changes? Maybe their non-alarm is some sort of psychological mechanism where if your brain can see no way of realistically addressing a problem it ignores it.
The non-alarm rationale from Andreas basically was, ghash.io has no incentive to attack/exploit/disrupt the system.
Sure maybe that is the case *right now*, who's to say that can't change, who's to say someone other than ghash *with* an incentive to disrupt the network can't gain control of their system.

Oh so they are going to stop accepting credit cards?
What's that you say *reasonable guess*?
They're going to continue accepting credit cards?!
That "mitigating chargeback risk" is so often used as a selling point when for that to be the case, bitcoin would have to be the only currency used by the merchant, is kind of embarassing. 
Fact: If you are accepting both bitcoins and credit cards, you are not "mitigating chargeback risk," because guess what, someone intent on chargeback fraud is not going to use bitcoin. Shocking I know.
Do we have any selling points that can stand up to a little logic?

Yeah, not to say the source of the gox problems was transaction malleability, but it was kinda cringey when he and others were like, gox is full of shit, transaction malleability is not a problem at all. Then the other exchanges were like, actually this looks like a problem, we're going to have to shutdown for a bit to fix it. Then someone started using it to DoS the bitcoin network.

So they're offering something people have a genuine desire for, rides, for free, and they're surprised people are taking them up on the offer? Am I missing something? 
Okay, she was shocked at how many people were. But how many people was it? And what would constitute a non-shocking amount?
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:32:09
Brilliant, way to find the silver lining!

I don't know if you are disagreeing with me, or just saying that his words were saying one thing while his actions another, but just for reference -

Have any pictures?
