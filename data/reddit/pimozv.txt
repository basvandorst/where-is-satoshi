I've tried!   It also fails!
@_date: 2013-02-22 10:41:29
Well, you can't do that with the vanilla client, can you?  You need to use two clients.  Import the key in one of them and send the bitcoins to the other one.  It's a bit of a hassle.
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:37:23
Fair point.

I did not know he praised bitcoin.  I missed that.  Don't bother giving me a link, I guess it will be easy to find.   Thanks for telling anyway.

Well, the bad news is that now we know Al Kaida knows about bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-04-11 17:43:08


No, because only fools put a lot of bitcoins on an exchange account.
@_date: 2013-03-08 15:33:49
Could happen.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:41:36
That's not the point.  Bitcoin is decentralized as a currency, but it's not an exchange plateform.  
@_date: 2013-02-13 21:54:19
This is one of my most favorite channel!!  It was so weird to hear him talk about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:36:37
Currency exchange is not all bitcoin activity.   A Mt. Gox failure would hurt bitcoin but would not kill it.
Best you can do to avoid such a problem is not to put all your bitcoins on a Mt. Gox account, but on your local vanilla client.
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:17:46
Stop being such a noob and go read the bitcoin documentation.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:52:08
lol  it's not a black hole this time?  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:00:21
Isn't that the first very high profile support of bitcoin?

Until bitcoin is used as any currency on the Forex, you'll be an early adopter.

Will the wage be denominated in bitcoins??   If so, we will finally know how difficult it would be for company to manage the market volatility for paying employees.

Stock markets.   I mean, apart from shares of SatoshiDice, what kind of bitcoin-labeled financial instruments can I buy?
@_date: 2013-02-22 05:22:52
Yep.  Kind of like how we used to send a text message to someone before email.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:55:58
Unfortunatly, you might be right.

OMG, playing poker in Minecraft with actual bitcoins.   That's just awesome.

1.  what about spam?
2.  you can't prevent people from joining their forces in something
3.  Ripple?
4.  do it.

It is normally not possible.  All asks are supposed to meet the best bids.  For this to happen, it would be necessary that all bids were below 1EUR at the moment the guy put a ask limit at 1EUR.  Quite unlikely.  It is either a bug in the adjudication algorithm or a prank.

The only thing that litecoin has to offer is an other hashing algorithm.
If this hashing algorithm appeared to be indeed better than SHA-256, then the bitcoin protocol could be modified to use it.    Satoshi already mentioned that IIRC.  He wrote something saying that there's nothing preventing the software to do:
     if (blockHeight &gt; HEIGHT_LIMIT_FOR_HASH_CHANGE) {
          // do this
     } else {
         // do that
     }
@_date: 2013-02-13 04:05:38
Though I see what you mean, please notice that an anarcho-capitalist free market Minecraft server would not have any particular "official" currency.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:23:20
Satoshi made the same comparison I don't remember where.

Bitcoin *is* a hard currency.

There is no single mention of bitcoin in this movie, is there?
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:20:18
Precious metals are fine indeed.  But you can't spend them easily on internet.  And they are easier to confiscate.
The question you should ask yourself is rather:   which percentage of bitcoins should I own as compared to precious metals?   1%, 10%, 50%?  You decide.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:58:33
It's not exactly what I'd call a blessing.   First, he did not mention bitcoin specifically; despite what suggests the title of this thread.
Second, he says the FED does not **necessarily** have the authority to regulate virtual currencies, but he does not fail to remind everyone that they did indeed intervene to shut down Liberty Reserve when it was clear that it was used for money laundering.
Sounds like a warning, to me.

This number is 2^160 , right?

There are about as many possible bitcoin addresses as there are water molecules on earth.

What a waste.  This paper has almost certainly been thrown in the trash.
@_date: 2013-02-23 08:25:16


Plausibly, yeah.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:02:32
Stop whining.  Such misbehavior is not so surprising.

You can see it as a lottery.  Your chance of winning increases with the number of tickets you own, and your computing power allows you to get as many lottery tickets as you can.

I don't get why he sells preloaded keys.  A buyer probably wants to make sure there is no copy of the private key somewhere, so he will probably transfer the bitcoins on a freshly generated address anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:20:46
I bought my first bitcoins via cash in the mail.

This reminds me of the paths to 1$, then to 10$.  Could be the path to 100$ now.

My first thought:  "you gotta be kidding me!"
@_date: 2013-02-21 04:11:37
I don't see that on bitcoinwatch.com
@_date: 2013-03-05 12:21:37
lov' it.
@_date: 2013-10-13 22:04:22
he kind of mentioned bitcoin out of the blue, didn't he?
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:08:07
Wow.  Excellent interview.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:52:12
I had no guarantee whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, my second command was lost (10$).   But on the first command I had managed to buy hundreds of bitcoins for 10$, so...
@_date: 2013-03-29 14:54:51
Just ask to get the thing you buy first.

Do you know about [minetest](   It's not as advanced or pretty as minecraft but it's free and open source software.  Code is in C++, modding is in Lua. 
Apart from this, your project seems awesome.  Keep on the good work!
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:53:03
Made me smile.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:40:27
MtGox can't print bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-16 01:41:22
The fact that they were talking about a possible backdoor in a free and open-source software makes be doubt they know much about what they are talking about.
