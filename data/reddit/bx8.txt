Sorry but I'm starting to this is bullshit..
So your brother read the code and said he could write it better with 0 errors? Uh-huh.
"Yalla, bye"
So you're arab? You speak arabic? Last time I checked you were Japanese/American, not arab descending.....
This doesn't add up, I think we are being trolled.

What determines the rise or fall of the bitcoin price?
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:30:31
I would say this is more like a complicated long-term gambling game rather than an investment such as stocks.

Can you imagine losing the information for that wallet, never being able to access those coins again.
Nearly 2 million dollars.... Gone..... Forever....

Whenever you appear in court for the first time and they ask you to enter a plea, a lawyer ALWAYS recommends "not guilty" until they have time to see the evidence in full.
Also, it opens the door for a plea bargain.

That's fucking amazing, please tell me bitconitip is your account?

Same thing happened to me... I sold at 560 but it filled the order at 532.... :/

If I ever become rich from this, I will keep it to myself cept close friends who have been with me through my highs and lows.

I just quadruppled my money using the simulator. I wonder if I can do that in real life....
@_date: 2013-10-03 09:40:15
Id rather sell it online, no one around me in my country is interested to buy at this time.

I'm with a local bank. I can accept transfers of USD from the USA... but I'm outside of that.
I can accept any currency from any bank but I just need to know a good site where I can unload my coins back into dollars (or any other currency) and have it sent via an international transfer.
I hope this helps

I wish I had known about this a little bit earlier, I just lost 1.988BTC for two gift cards...
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:41:54
I.... Don't even know what to say....
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:16:49
It's speculation, not investment.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:40:41
Thanks man, I didn't buy this for quick money. Honestly, I feel it in my bones that each coin will be worth 1000's of dollars eventually so I'm just going to stick it out. I don't need this money that I've gambled on bitcoins, I'm willing to lose it but I'm also willing to follow my gut.
So far I've complained about losing money but realistically I think I'll gain it all back at some point.
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:29:34
Wow fuck, I bought coins at 80.
@_date: 2013-10-29 07:59:47
The fee is way to high for me to be interested.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:56:34
Glad I bought more coins the other day at USD$150...
Honestly though, it's going to fall eventually... Let's be realistic here, yes, right now it's just past USD$200 but how long can it sustain this growth before the bottom falls out?
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:06:13
I bought at 190 and at 80.... I feel like a tard.
