Same here. They must be running with the money...

Because all transactions are publicly visible, is there any way to displace the donations? I'm don't think the donation quantity should be public knowledge.

I appreciate the concern, cryptography has been outside of my radar, but I deeply value the input you all have given and I hope to educate myself in order to implement it appropriately.

Yes! That would require an obscene amount of QR code labels though. Maybe an image recognition feature that pulls up an AR QR code?

Off topic, but a Bitcoin exhibit would be interesting...

That's the ticketing solution that seems to be the most practical.

That's good to know. We'll definitely work out the transaction fees if we decide to go along with this. Thanks!

That's the kind of experience I'd like to bring! Some sort of app that allows you to designate specific pieces of art or galleries and allow for a tailored donation.

How does one sign something with their private key without exposing it?
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:01:33
Thank you! BitPay would be ideal.

We're looking into a bring your own device (BYOD) program where we can deliver these services through an app/webapp with a rental backup. That requires very little setup, but I appreciate the offer and will be sure to reach out if I require further collaboration.

Yes, that much has been made clear. I'll probably go with coinbase or BitPay (the latter being free for non-profits).
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:15:42
Sounds doable at least. Does the coinbase API support that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:58:37
back up.

It definitely seems like it does on the individual account. I'll have to look into it some more on the merchant end.
