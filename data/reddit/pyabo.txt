No, it makes perfect sense.  They only thing they would be "buying" is a number in a spreadsheet, if they don't have control of the actual funds.  In fact, letting the price drop so low is probably an indication that they are insolvent.  Otherwise someone on the inside *would* have scooped up all the cheap coins already.

You don't have to have a PhD in economics to realize this story is sketchy.  OK let's assume everything you've said is true.

They fact that they haven't (evidently) done this already is for me the strongest argument that they are insolvent.  Otherwise there's just too much easy money on the table.  The idea that this would somehow violate insider trading laws certainly hasn't been tested in any court I've ever heard of.

If anyone at all makes money out of this, it'll be lawyers.  You might get *pennies* on the dollar after years of wrangling, but I doubt even that much.
Honest question: Why did you have it all tied up at MtGox?  Surely you read multiple times about why you shouldn't do that?  I'm honestly just trying to understand the psychology behind so many people making this mistake.  It's staggering to me that Gox had control of so many coins.

@_date: 2019-04-29 18:22:53
A ubiquitous Bitcoin payment system would, by necessity, rely on 3rd party applications, hardware, and providers.  All of these would provide new attack vectors, regardless of the mathematically sound nature of the blockchain / Bitcoin itself.  Think about all the (successful) hacks against exchanges that have occurred...  It's one thing to say that theoretically BTC is more secure than CC payments, but you have to contrast that with actual real-world experience and facts.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:08:16

Right now the BTC community is absolutely chock full of two things: scam artists and incompetently run businesses.  We have to fix both these problems, and individual users being more skeptical with their hard-earned BTC is a big first step.

Where exactly is the "risk" for them if this is a con?  Their FPGAs are just BFL-branded and programmed boards from an existing manufacturer of FPGAs.  I'd say that's pretty risk-free.

The parts they are already shipping, so far as I can tell, are just pre-programmed 3rd party FPGA boards.  Also, this is a textbook example of a long con...

I'm not saying BFL is a scam.  I have no idea.  But right now, the way they've chosen to do business and communicate with their ~~suckers~~ customers matches the profile... and one of their principles appears to be a convicted con man.

Many early adopters are sitting on hundreds of thousands of BTC right now.  What they need to do with those coins is fund BitCoin startups.  Pay employees with BTC, buy equipment with BTC, etc.  Now that the price seems to have stabilized, this could be really smart investment for people hoarding coins: Get a big chunk of a potentially profitably company while simultaneously increasing the value of your own holdings.

How about an unfriendly administration telling the DoD to go after Bitcoin-based services?  All they have to do is say it's a haven for criminal activity and money laundering.

OK, thanks for the explanation.  But I'm still wondering how this constitutes manipulation of the market?  By definition, the spot price moves according to the price people are willing to buy and sell at... I don't think it's fair to say someone is "manipulating" the market if they are working entirely in the context of the market.  That's just not how market manipulation works, typically.  How would they possibly make money doing this?

Sure, that's the easy part.  Create an MMO.  No problem.
And THEN... for in-game rewards you give out real-world currency.  Several problems with this... but one of the biggest is that you're ignoring one of the great perks of selling digital goods in an MMO: the ability for the owner to mint new items or gold at the touch of a button.  They are printing money over there, why complicate it with Bitcoin and force them to fund the system first?  That doesn't make sense from a developer standpoint.
In the end nobody is going to play your MMO just because it has Bitcoin in it (there already is one, in fact).  People only play an MMO if it's a good MMO.  And *that*, my friend, is the hard part.

This is sort of a nonsense question and can't really be answered.  If you shut down literally every exchange there would be no Bitcoin, because there would be no way to acquire it or spend it.  Every transaction for Bitcoin for some other good is an "exchange" in miniature.
If you mean, more simply, that every current online exchange were shut down.... First, the price would plummet.  Second, new exchanges would could online.  If that were prevented somehow, more primitive local exchanges driven by manual processes (remember when stock quotes were printed in the newspaper every day?) would crop up to take their place.  "Hey I hear Lenny down on 6th is buying BTC  today."  "Oh is that so?  Well maybe you should go see Lenny then, cuz I'm only giving you $13.50/BTC, take it or leave it."

It's not theft.  Period.  It's unfortunate, possibly even tragic.  It's indicative of possible negligence in the handling of the money.  But it's not theft.
Let's turn it around.  If Bob gave you money with the understanding that you were going to lend it to other people in order to make money with it... and then you lent it to Frank, Jim, Sally, Boba Fett, and Matt... and then those people default on their loans...  leaving you unable to pay back Bob... did you **steal** from Bob?  Is it theft?  The answer is no.  But you probably should have done better homework on Frank, Jim, Sally, Boba Fett, and Matt.  I mean... fer Christ's sake, Boba Fett isn't even a real person!

I had the same question... OP says high performance is a chief goal and then goes with an interpreted script backend?  I don't get that part.  Surely you'd get better performance out of Java, C++, or .NET; even if your system is I/O bound that's one less layer of abstraction.
My experience with node.js is nil, so maybe I'm just biased.
@_date: 2013-02-13 19:14:00
That number is pure speculation.  To put it simply, it's bullshit.  Since the number of coins mined each month is (relatively) static, it's easy to do the calculation.  At the current price you would have to own 1/300th of all hashing power to make that much money in a month.  Is that  possible?  How much are you going to invest?
For completeness sake, here's my math:
25 coin block size * 6 blocks per hour * 24 hours * $25/coin = $90,000USD per day shared by ALL miners.  So to hit $9,000/month you'd need approximately 1/300th of the hashing total.  So hopefully only 299 people also buy the same amount of ASICs as you.  You think the market is that small?  I don't.
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:20:41

One thing I would like to add to this discussion and I hope it gets noticed after all the traffic:  The idea that Bitcoin is going to stop this sort of thing from happening is absurd.  If everyone had their assets in a Bitcoin wallet, this bank wouldn't exist to begin with.  Likewise, the loans they made to other people wouldn't happen... you'd have a pretty stagnate economy.  This is one of the biggest reasons we moved off of the gold standard.  The idea that Bitcoin is just going to magically eliminate modern banking is both naive and unproductive.  It completely neglects the positive economic gains you get from banking.  The loans the banks are making are what allows you to, say, *buy a house*, or start a small business.
Jimmy Stewart explains it pretty well:  :)

The system is designed so that only a set number of coins will be mined over any given time period, no matter how much hashing power is being used.  The ASIC miners will all be splitting up the same pool that currently being split by everyone.  Whoever started this 1500GH/s setup is just getting in nice and early... eventually his share will drop from 10% to 1% and then to 0.1% (or whatever) as everyone else's ASICs come online.

This is the only rational reply I've found so far in this thread.

Sense folks seem to be missing my point, I will elaborate:  The question itself is misleading.  Asking "what if all the bitcoin exchanges were shut down" is basically the same question as "what if Bitcoin were completely shut down?"  That question has a pretty obvious answer: Lots of value tied up in Bitcoin would suddenly disappear.
Now clearly... this is not something that is currently possible (that we know of).  So really this question is similar to nonsense questions like the old horse-sized duck vs. 100 duck-sized horses.
Or, perhaps more accurately, it's an Epimenidean paradox.  The question both assumes the existence of Bitcoin and also makes it impossible.

So.... pushing back shipping until March?
Wait, we had a problem with our harmonic discombobulator... it's gonna be April.
Actually, scratch that, our office Tabby passed away this week and we're all just too choked up to really work... it's gonna be May.  For sure.
Or possibly July.

We are not far behind... our debt to GDP ratio is already over 100% and climbing quickly.  Remember the budget crisis we had not too long ago?  Well, it didn't get solved it only got pushed back.  Which means the next time it's even harder to solve.  I don't see how any rational investor could take a look at our current state of politics and put money in US gov't bonds.  Moody's (?) downgraded (or threatened to downgrade) the US's AAA credit rating.  I think it should be more like a C.

Holy crap.  There IS a god!  I hope this is for real.  He deserves it.  Now if I could just headbutt everyone who ever gave this guy money... I'd be so happy.

If you're looking for something risky... Bitcoin is a great bet.  But it's definitely on the high end of the risk spectrum, and currently at its all-time high.  If you're looking for more traditional investments, steer clear.  (but learn about Bitcoin anyway)

Well, maybe some other gullible suckers will learn the lesson from it.
There were dozens (hundreds) of people warning idiots away from pirateat40's ponzi scheme from DAY ONE... and yet... somehow he still managed to run off with $2M.

LOL.  Even better than the original post.  Should have seen this one coming a mile away and somehow did not.

Your business was doomed from the start if ONE bad transaction sinks you.  I know you're looking for sympathy here, but let's apply a little common sense.  It sucks you got scammed... Now are you going to suck it up and deal, or collapse into a little pile of crying 6 year old girls?  Come on, man.  Step 1) pursue through PayPal.  Step 2) Fire off a legal threat.  Step 3) Forget about it, go on with your life.

Hmmm... OK this is starting to sound better.  At least with addition of a player-chosen random number you can know that the casino isn't stacking a deck against you, unlike hazekBTC's description.

Zero sympathy.  Anyone who actually orders hardware from this company at this point deserves what they get 100% over.

This is ridiculous and isn't going to help Bitcoin adoption at all.

The amount of "it's not a bubble" optimism in this thread is amazing.  You people have blinders on.
Also, the idea that talking about a bubble, or being bearish on its price is somehow deprecating Bitcoin or that I'm against it in general is ridiculous.  This is something you do in the real world.

I love this book, and Stephenson is clearly a good futurist (although not as prescient as William Gibson)... but the digital currency in this book is **completely** different from Bitcoin.  It's a simple gold-backed ecurrency.

I'm not "faulting" the guy.  I also say good on him for having an entrepreneurial spirit, but he needs to man up here and act like a professional if he really wants to run a Bitcoin related business.  BTC has been the target of innumerable scams.  PayPal is scammer heaven and everyone involved in BTC already *knows* that, it's one of the whole reasons to get Bitcoin into the mainstream!  So please forgive me if I do a little eye-rolling when someone says, "OMG I've been scammed!"  No shit?  Join the club.

Another perfect example of what's stopping Bitcoin from going mainstream.  It's just too esoteric and technical right now when even someone who is obviously up to date on the technology has to ask, "How do I use this?"
What it's going to take for Bitcoin to really succeed is an entire layer of super-easy UI and process over ALL the technical mumbo jumbo.
