Although it's quite creamy, and costs next to nothing, no-one seems to like it.

Have you really got the spare time to write all that?
It seems very strange to me.
Why don't you go and mow your lawn, or trim a tree or something?
I just don't get it.

I choose to use the :) symbol, when used, to close my parentheses (technically they are not brackets.)  Otherwise there is an unstylish duplication of symbols.

Does anyone ever stop lying?
That was about 800 words of trolling.
You're claiming to have composed that entire pile of boring and obvious shite at under one second per word.
It was well constructed, but your punctuation is poor.
What's your motive for writing all of that, and then claiming you knocked it off in a spare few minutes?
Just stop lying please.

Is there anything else but misdirection and lying from trolls on this board?
800 words in 20 minutes?  0.67 words per second.  Under one word per second.
Why all the lying?  
What is your motivation?

.. and 800 words / 1200 seconds = 0.067 words / second.
1.  Why are you appealing to the mods to support your poor understanding of basic arithmetic, after tl;dr-ing on this board?
2.  Why are you arguing with a postgraduate in mathematics?

If this were a word, I would be impressed.  But it is not, so I am not.  :)

Wear ladies panties, shave your balls and harass vegans.

Bcash comfortably under 0.04 now.  
3.8% and falling.  
I guess that shitshow bait and switch is over.
