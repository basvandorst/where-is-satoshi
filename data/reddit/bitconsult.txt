Buy 1/3 now. You'll be happy if it goes up. You'll be happy to buy more at a discount if it goes down.

thanks for reading!

Same here. I found it easier to share a link rather than type up responses to everyone. Bitconsult is developing into a blog and consulting services. As a former investment adviser, I'm finding that a lot of fellow advisers are getting questions about Bitcoin, so I've been working with financial folks a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:55:54
That's definitely a good start!

Yeah I got -200 comment karma for asking how "buy bch now" made the top of the subreddit. It was from bots. Still permanently destroys my karma though and still can't post on r/cryptocurrency cuz of it lol

Easier to read a book with my infant climbing all over me than to read my monitor! Kill the trees!

I bought it too. Love paper :)

I'm not a (good) coder, but there are some great cheap/free resources to learn how to code that are better than University classes. I recently took python for data science intro: 
That introduction was free, and may get you interested in the growing field of data science. There are jobs in all sectors for that.
Cryptography is a very advanced field that requires high level mathematics degrees. For an into, check out the origins of "PGP" encryption.

Gotta start somewhere! I'm transitioning from my 8 year reddit account to this account in order to focus specifically on cryptocurrency and promote my (free, ad-free) website, bitconsult.co

This is the definitive guide on Bitcoin and blockchain for non coders as well. Just skip the coding parts. Towards the end are potential applications for blockchain. Side channels, proof of existence are particularly interesting. The code book is a great read for an intro into cryptography. What kind of career path are you looking for? I believe and investment advisor background can help for valuations, and getting experience explaining any technical topics to people.

You think they care what they mine? 95% don't. Not many will mine at a loss to support the protocol they believe in.

Wow, beautiful website! I particularly like the "Should I Buy Bitcoin" page. I'll definitely link you to our resources page. Do you have a business associated with your website, or are you just spreading the Bitcoin gospel? Either way, respect! Good luck with your Bitcoin ventures.

Haha of course, no one's strong enough to resist blockfolio refreshes forever....

I'm on readthrough number 3. Always get a better understanding each time.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:04:23
thanks for posting! I'd love to see more comments like this. I'm having a hard time finding good podcasts/books etc and get caught in the trap of reading twitter/reddit/refreshing blockfolio. Got any other tips?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:01:46
lol, yea I'm transitioning from my personal reddit to this account in order to focus on cryptocurrency and promote my (free) website, bitconsult.co I post weekly blogs and alt-coin analysis. If ya enjoy it, spread the word! Really hoping to improve the discussions on reddit (both btc and bitcoin) as well!

Yes, he's my hero &lt;3

Great work! What an opportunity to teach. Most people don't go past the (often skewed) headlines. We all need to be teachers!

thanks for reading. yea it's hard cuz i spent 10 hours writing a mining blog a few weeks ago, so i linked that. hard to explain everything from scratch every time.

I like the idea of prime coin, I want to read more about it. I wonder if it is more game-able....if a fraction or work can be done ahead of time. Do you have any in depth resources?
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:33:28
There are lots of options. Sign up for them all. Have cash loaded, don't blame others.

No idea, I'd check out ACINQs website, they put out this android LN wallet. The cool thing is that LN is open source and has a specification, so anyone can make the app. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:39:10
Thanks for reading!
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:02:03
The introduction is very high-level. I'd suggest this video for a more detailed intro to LN. Please share your favorite resources! 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:03:19
Yep, I hear ya. I opened 2 connections with 2 well connected nodes at first and I couldn't get my payment to blockstream. Some people said it may have had an issue due to the amount I was trying to spend (&gt;$10).
Down the line, I'm assuming there'll be much more funding in channels and many more connections. Hoping to only need 1-2 open channels to pay anyone. Will probably see more hub and spoke type nodes that will fill most of your needs or even "simulated" LN where your wallet provider handles the actual transfers for you, but that'd be the maximized end of trusted LN and would be akin to holding your coins on an exchange IMO.

Haha. -12 comment. Not bad. I got -200 from one. Damn bots.

If the article was helpful, please upvote this comment. I don't spend much time on reddit but I need some comment karma to be able to post to other subreddits. Thanks!!
