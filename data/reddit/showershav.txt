The main idea is someone who just sold bitcoin in China and knows that money will clear can rebuy on the lower exchange with almost zero risk as long as he has extra fiat to use until funds clear ( yes that is not most people, but it is little risk for those who have access ).    
As well as someone buying bitcoin on the lower priced exchanges can quickly sell any btc ( ok maybe an hour to deposit that btc at Huobi ) knowing those funds will eventually clear. 
Maybe people don't have much experience with arbitrage especially big money arbitrage.

So you see nothing fishy about people not taking the easy arbitrage opportunity?  Or maybe they are and like I said it doesn't matter.  At a few dollars you could argue big money might not think the risk is worth the money.  At 5 dollars you could probably still have an argument.  10 dollars and you even still might have an argument if the spread was short lived.  We have more then a 10 dollar spread, closer to 20 per coin at times now and it is lasting more then a flash move.

Problem is last time we saw exchanges diverging too much we all got goxed.
Something is wrong on some exchange.  Too many people would be taking advantage of the arbitrage.  
Like I said last time the exchanges diverged like this we got goxed..

You draw it out like each step takes days instead of minutes.  I am only aware of the process I use ( like I said I have never used huobi, maybe it does take days for them ).  In my case it does not take days but less then a day on normal business days.  Remember people with money in a position probably have a lot better turn around times.  They most likely are able to buy bitcoin and not wait for a pending sale to hit their accounts ( Unlike you and me that probably don't have hundreds of thousands in liquid capital ) knowing that it will eventually clear.  That is the same in the opposite direction so it further cuts time you might think is needed for funds to clear every step.   Again even for a small potatoes guy like me that must wait to use proceeds from a sale to buy again or visa versa it is less then a day.  I am verified though and do use bank accounts.

People have been doing it for a long time with btc and alt coins ever since multiple exchanges opened and the prices diverged.  I did it daily and sometimes hourly with great success at much lower spreads that only lasted hours at most.  Maybe you have a point that it is extremely hard to change btc to fiat for anyone over in China at Huobi but this would be the first I heard of it.  To be clear I never used an account at Huobi or okcoin etc the major exchanges in Asia.
