Hi, yeah the datasource is OpenStreetMap. At this point it's not really designed as an alternative to CoinMap as far as finding merchants, just as a way of keeping updated with new ones. So it doesn't have all the merchants from CoinMap, only merchants added since a week or so ago. Eventually I do plan to get the thousand or so merchants currently listed on CoinMap but that'd be quite hard on the API so I'll space it out a bit.

No I don't think that, and I never said I did. The keyword is **pointlessly**. AFAIK banks don't have systems which literally require inefficient burning of energy for no good reason.

Because electricity is not an unlimited resource.

Running a global network does not require people to be doing purposefully difficult math on specialized power hungry machines. The internet uses more but not because it's literally designed to encourage people to use as much electricity as possible.
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:51:10
I'm not sure if it'd make a difference if we know the total energy usage of the banking system.
I think the problem is that it's very hard to understand what all the Bitcoin energy consumption is actually for, whereas I can walk into a bank or use an ATM and be like yeah of course we need power to run a machine with buttons and a screen and moving parts.
Also another reason why Bitcoin is low hanging fruit is because it literally rewards people with money for using more power.

I remember back before Bitcoin exploded in popularity there were tonnes of posts excitedly talking about new places who let you buy things with Bitcoin and posting screenshots of online Bitcoin purchases.... People were interested in Bitcoin because they wanted it to become a new global currency.
Now it's full of the worst sorts of people, speculators and investors who don't give a shit about anything except their personal wealth. These are the same people who's worldview is so twisted by greed that they cannot believe someone would make a post like this without some sort of ulterior motive.

From the video I watched it said the coins would arrive "within an hour" since that's how long it would take the network to verify that transaction. Apart from that no delay as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:46:58
Mining is how Bitcoins are brought into circulation. It's pretty cool actually. Individuals miners use their computers (or dedicated hardware) to do intensive calculations and are "rewarded" with Bitcoins. The miners computers are also being used confirm transactions contained within blocks in the blockchain so that a bitcoin can't be double spent. Bitcoins will keep being "rewarded" to miners until the limit of 21 million coins is reached and then all coins will be in circulation and miners will be rewarded with the sum of small transaction fees instead. 
This is of course a massive simplification but that's roughly how it works. You could compare Bitcoin mining to the way traditional money is brought into circulation (by printing it) if it makes it easier to understand. There is also a difficulty value which dictates how easy it is to do the calculations required to mine. Back in 2011ish anyone with a GPU could mine bitcoins profitably because the difficulty was much lower. I was getting around 1 Bitcoin per day from mining with my GPU, although they were worth &lt;$10. Nowadays it's very difficult to mine profitably and you need to buy expensive dedicated hardware. Most people don't mine.

I started GPU mining when I was around 15-16 and was easily getting one Bitcoin per day. For some reason I lost confidence and stopped mining with about 12 coins. Then I sold a whole bunch (for like $60) last year and now I only have four. Every time it shoots up in value I find myself working out how much I'd have if I hadn't sold those and kicking myself... I can only imagine how much I'd have if I kept mining.
Investing money into something as volatile as Bitcoin is very stressful. Try not to do what I did and sell prematurely or you'll regret it forever.

Based on your statements I'm going to suggest that you do some more research and attempt to understand Bitcoin a little more. You demonstrate a misunderstanding of Bitcoin on the fundamental level. Skimming the Wikipedia article is not enough.
I don't mean to appear hostile, it's just that all of your questions could be answered by reading the basic information on Bitcoin which already exists online.

Nobody KNOWS they will raise in value again. They might decrease and you might lose money. That's a very real possibility with Bitcoin. Just make sure you don't put in anything you can't afford to lose.

I wouldn't really recommend investing into Bitcoin unless you have vast quantities of money and don't mind losing some. We all like to make predictions but nobody really knows where it's going. Maybe it'll grow until it replaces our current currencies or maybe people will gradually lose interest and it will crash back to zero. Or maybe it will just exist as another alternative currency for online purchases or whatever. It all depends on a huge number of factors and frankly it could go either way.
The system itself is rock solid however. I guess it kinda was poofed into existence but the entity that poofed it doesn't really have any control over it any more. You should read up on the concept of the blockchain. Also on coin generation.

That would be nice... But then there'd probably be legal ramifications for Bitcoin-24 if they accidentally returned funds to the supposed money launderers so they probably have to be sure of everybody's identities. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:33:10
Sure. Basically there are three options available:
1. No payouts until conclusive release of all monies
2. Once information and file scrutiny shall have been made available, payouts of audited and legitimate claims
3. Payout to all customers of an amount derived from the ratio of 72% (after legitimization of claims and verification of identity). The remaining amounts will be payed out once the seizure of the Polish account is lifted.
