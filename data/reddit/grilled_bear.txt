Your numbers are wrong, the latest survey (results were published two days ago) say 36% No, 11% probably no, 15% don't know/didn't answer, 11% probably yes and 27% yes.
Source (in German): 
The survey was made by the [SRG](

I don't know where your numbers are from, but that's not true. 48% No, 8% probably no, 5% don't know/didn't answer, 14% probably yes and 25% yes. Even if you total yes and probably yes you'll only get 39% opposed to 56% if you total no and probably no.

I'm Swiss. The average Swiss isn't asking for this. It's another stupid right-wing idea that will propably (and hopefully) be declined by the Swiss voters. All the pro-committee is doing is some propaganda and fear mongering.

Not only that, but the number is from a survey that was carried out by 20 Minuten only and those usually don't represent the mindest of the average Swiss, because the people who take part are usually 20 Minuten readers and in one or the other way interested in the topic (here probably those who are very pro-ecopop) and thus motivated to answer their survey. Therefore: Never trust the results 20 Minuten survey. 
SRG surveys are the way to go. Those are usually quite accurate (it has happened that they were off by some percent, but not too badly) and answered by more people/a broader audience.

Yes, I know it could be sold in state of emergency, but who do you think knows their business better? The ones operating the SNB or the Swiss People? I'm Swiss and I'll rather trust the ones who are working at the SNB, the average Swiss just doesn't know enough about economy. You should get over your prejudice that everybody who manages a big institute that handles money (what you call *the samll elite* is literally Hitler.

Now compare the US standard of living/Inflation/unemployment to the Swiss one and you'll see just how good the US is doing thanks to their gold.

It was one of the main argument of those who initiated the initiative and everybody know it. I as a Swiss can not understand why this subreddit here is so Pro-Gold-Initiative, many Swiss are laughing at people who think it would have been a good idea to include that the SNB can't sell gold except in state of emergency.

20% Gold might not be such a bad idea, but it's simply stupid that this proposal also demands that the gold that was bought can't be sold anymore.

You are proof for *"The average voter and person knows nothing about how central banking, or the monetary system in general, works."*
