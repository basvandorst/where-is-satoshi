I was also thinkimg of using my old Pi 2 that's been my old Kodi media center. You received any new information if a Pi2 can handle the hardware requirements?
Cheers for the awesome guide!

It's a reflexive relationship, not one supports the other. I didn't say the USD dominance will last forever... Just that it is backed by something that can provide resources almost out of thin air.
When the money is weak, the millitary jumps in. When the millitary is weak, the money is sent there. They support eachother. And right now, both the US military and the USD are strong. At least apparently.

Just to play the devils advocate here:
1)The USD has an army backing it. And that army can TAKE(as in get for free) resources(oil among other things), that can sustain the value of the USD.
2)Bitcoins main use case is a safehaven, which does imply moving money out of the grasp of the government, which does imply it's used for illegal activites mainy. But this shouldn't worry you, as the safehaven industry is a huge one, and it does provide demand in the future...

I always answer that he/she should listen to less mainstream media amd think more for himself. It's not an inviting answer, but if he gets it, he gets it, and if he doesn't get it, you can bring any argument, cause he will be locked into his programming anyway...

Anyone else thinking tax deductions?
