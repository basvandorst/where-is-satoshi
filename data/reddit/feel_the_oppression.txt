It feels to me a lot of the time most everyone wants to drag me down to be as miserable as they are. It's really hard to find friends that legit want you to succeed.

Being new money rich unfortunately doesn't come with good judgment. Take that one dumbass who threw that hard disk away and let it sit in a landfill. He was rich once and he literally threw his fortune in the trash. 
People have an automatic tendency to aspire to more and to compare themselves against people who are better off, I do it automatically if I don't check myself, but try if you can to see how you are a part of early adoption of something potentially groundbreaking and about how lucky you are to be who you are &amp; where you are atm.

I thought the same thing at like...437$. To me it seemed crazy to pay 437$ : "400 bucks!? For a computer coin?!"
It still seems a little crazy tbh, but I will hodl what little I have.

You don't understand the weekend excuse. If it's calm over the weekend, it's because it's the weekend.
Of course since it's the weekend it could be volatile too...that much should be obvious.

Roger Ver is likely to compensate for the embarrassing way that he was born. Not many people know this and among his family it is not often discussed, but he was actually birthed via the rectum. Roger Ver was a poop baby.

I thought something similar about how people get into narrow perspectives that don't make sense thinking about how many people have been saying things in effect about timing the market to get in 'in a dip.' I looked at a graph ytd and at 3mo and it made no sense to try and time anything. You were almost without exception better getting in earlier.

That's a big problem with bitcoin news in general, I check headlines through google on my android and it seems it orders story headlines based on how sensationalized it is. Here's one right now "**Bitcoin Soaring** to $12k As *Spectacular Buying Pressure* Continues"
I normally just want to get a couple headlines to feel out the news real quick but then they get me panicked and I spend the next one to two hours tabbed here reading up just in case.

I am worried that if I do a transaction and it gets lost before it gets confirmed what is the likelihood that I will lose my money. 
Specifically if coinbase sends something to a wallet and it gets lost and never makes it to my wallet.

It'll be a massive issue once the costs actually start weighing on people. Then we'll look back and wonder what the fuck people were thinking spending money on a new jet that costed over 1.5 trillion dollars (among thousands of other things).

Couldn't that be a reason not to buy bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:14:11
I don't presume to know the market's future value, but just on the basis of past performance at the time that the market was in its meteoric rise since August all the clamoring about dips, corrections was absolutely a waste of time and energy. 
 I've been all-in bitcoin for a while now, the small amounts of my paycheck i get I put in immediately, only market orders. I believe in bitcoin's future and as long as it acts like digital gold any price you can buy it for now will be cheap.

Will fees default to the 'LN provider' (don't know proper lingo) or are they still going to be per user? 
Hoping the LN will take the fees away from users, that'll stop the fears of the ups-downs of fees over the past few months for the users at least..

Yeah I understand it logically it's just that I'm in a situation that most people can probably empathize, I'm looking at 35 years until retirement at a job I don't love and the allure of having risked big and not having to work, or not so much, is really enticing to me. I can't help but put myself in his shoes and think about how good it would feel to call into work and announce on the spot that I'm retiring. Instead I took a really reserved approach and while I'm ahead I'm nowhere near as well off, and I just wish I had foresight as good as hind.

We're seeing accelerating growth, not static or decelerating. 12th to now has a 4000$ gain. The prior dip to peak was a 4400$ over seven weeks. (all i have for charts is coinmarketcap, these aren't exact  Similar gains in 1/3 time.  I've noticed reading the charts that this big rally has a much steeper slope than the previous ones had midyear. I honestly *want* to sell right now but what's keeping me in is that fact. Sometimes what you want to do conflicts with what you believe you should do, and this is one time I'm not listening to my gut.

Bitcoin if anything is just on the cusp of entering what will be an s-curve of adoption by more businesses, spenders, and savers. If you follow the market cap of crypto it's been adding 2 billion $ a day for like the past month, with some days 10 billino getting added. This has been speeeding up faster and faster, just as has the price for bitcoin has been. It took off faster from 4500 to 10000 than it did from 1000 to 4000, that would be what would be expected if we're in an s-curve, coinbase has been getting  a ton more accounts and more people know about btc now than ever before. 
As far as your thought that bitcoin is priced to high, you should know that the market always sets the right price! :) there's nothing that says a 10$ bitcoin is cheap or a 100000$ one too expensive, and when the market settles around a price someday (with less volatility) it'll be set without your or my approval. 
;I agree on you with the rest of your post, thanks.

It's been going strong for at least two straight weeks, I made a post on it last night because I wanted people's theories on what is actually going on but it only got two upvotes and like 5 comments. 
We're in the biggest bull market that bitcoin and crypto in general has ever seen **right now** but people would rather laugh at pics of fucking dbz characters and funny gifs.

I agree; I actually didn't know that the transactions have been so flat over time though. 
How do you factor fees into your view? The transaction fees have been what have checked increased numbers of transactions--this prevents people from using btc as they would a debit card. Around 2 weeks today the transaction fees *averaged* [18$]( 
This encourages people, at least at the moment, of using bitcoin in the way that they currently are, as an investment (used loosely, I know it's not the best term) To take the old example of a coffee, if I'd bought it on the 12th, I wouldn't think about using it as currency until I was sure I wouldn't have to deal with such a punishing fee for a small purchase.
Overall though I think if me or you is right/wrong ultimately comes down to that question that's in the air of if it's going to be mass adopted or not. You seem to know more about economics than I do; I think a big part of it is wrapped up in wheter people as a whole will come to believe in btc's potential, and right now it seems it's got the wind at its back.

I remember shitting on him or someone in a similar situation about 3 months ago or something. They were right, I was super wrong.

Hey, they got me. I was into crypto back in 2013 when I first invested in bitcoin, and I took their advice: I barely invested anything in it. I believed in it but thought that 'hey, these guys have my best interests at heart.' 
Just another sub ruined by a majority of readers who are stupid as shit and upvote a certain narrative of sanitized facts. They might help the average person with very basic investing activities but as far as bitcoin it shows they're stuck in their ways and few of their subs were capable of looking into somthing truly novel.

He really needs to take his toys and go home. Controversy and shadiness follow him around like a cloud and he's only damaging himself at this point.
