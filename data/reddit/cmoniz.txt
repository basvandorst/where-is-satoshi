use coinbase API, it's one of the easiest ways to integrate. if you want to get fancy though, you can also just integrate with a running bitcoin node via RPC. i personally didn't like bitpay's API.

We should view this action for what it really is. It's the local taxpayer-funded mafia shaking down the new kid on the block with money. And they justify their actions by making it as boring as possible so no one actually cares. Business as usual.
Thankfully the technology makes it so that shakedowns no longer require banks to just hand over your money. It'll be much harder to justify the warrantless searches (money? what money), and it'll make finding that money much harder to find. Good luck asshats.
Encrypt your business databases folks. Never give in to coercion through violence. Raise hell and the community will answer your call.

is there a possibility that implementing sidechains could cause a bubble like this?
the core value of bitcoin comes from the fact that everyone knows exactly how much everyone else has. there will only be 21 million of them and you either have it or you don't.
if we allow sidechains into the core protocol, what happens when one of those sidechains dies off or is being run by an untrustworthy subgroup of people looking to run off with people's bitcoins?
this article is starting to make me see that allowing sidechains might unintentionally allow the economy to revert back to something unstable

If you think of it as an ROI, what is the potential long term revenue that you could gain from having an alternative currency in stock. The initial investment would be to build the system, and the long term costs would be minimal.
I used to work in a airline company, and one of the major leverages they had as an international corporation over domestic-only corporations was that the airline accepted USD, JPY, KRW, and so forth. So they were able to pay their bills off with one currency when it was stronger in relation to the rest of the currencies. This was critical for surviving the 2008 financial crisis, when the JPY was stronger then the dollar.
The accounting department will likely throw a fit because it's just one more book to balance, but it's obviously one of the most secure currencies out there, and it's a deflationary currency, unlike the fiat currencies. Now I'm not sure of all the specifics, but I know budget people add a few percent to wages and costs every year to account for the inflation rates of these currencies - that would not apply to bitcoin. The X% of the money in the bank wouldn't disappear every year just because you had it, due to inflation.
If you look at the volatility of Bitcoin, accepting it as a reserve currency, especially right now with the price so low, could prove very beneficial in the future. Simply track the USD exchange rate at the time of purchase, and whenever the exchange rate that the customer paid at is lower than the current exchange rate, exchange it, and use that to pay for your costs.

we started using coinbase as our bitcoin processor in it's very early days. in those days, coinbase didn't have the security systems it has now. for example, the IP filter that coinbase has on its depreciated API could have prevented this, but that didn't exist when I made the site last year (back when bitcoin was &lt;$150/btc). it's amazing how much they've grown.

bitcoin is like an internet bank. there are gazillions of deposit boxes, and not all of them have money inside. with bitcoin, you can create a key for the deposit box at home where no one can see you. when you want to open your deposit box, you fold your private key a few times to get the address of your deposit box, and then use it to unlock that box in the internet bank.

is there a risk of miners favoring other miners by withholding the data encoded by the IBLT from certain peers?
eg. A B and C are ghash.io, they only send the messages to each other and D is at a disadvantage to generating the next block because it takes some extra time to get the data it needs to start hashing the next block.

yeah, it's got a steep learning curve for everyone, you need to learn the basics of cryptography in order to really trust the currency.
if someone with awesome video skills has the time, i think a good analogy to how bitcoins and cryptography works is mixing colors. 
example: a private key is made of 6 highly unique colors that only the user knows. a public key is made of 2 unique colors that is created when combining the 6 unique private colors. many different combinations of colors can create the 2 unique colors (by adding the hues together), so attackers can't really guess.
bitcoins are created when a block is solved. a block is solved by passing a combination of 3 different colors over and over again into a hash function (SHA256 twice) until you get the color white (the block hash starts with a certain amount of 0's). one of those colors is certain shade of white from the previous block. since the function is designed to be as random as possible, no one knows exactly which colors will create white, so they have to keep trying multiple colors until they get a match. the blocks started off as gray, but slowly over time the blocks need to get whiter and whiter to be accepted, which is harder to do. every time a block is created, a transaction called the coinbase is tagged with the miners 2 public colors, and that tells the network that the miner now owns those coins.
sending a transaction from one person to another can be represented in colors as well. everyone has 6 private colors and 2 public colors. when our miner wants to spend their bitcoin, they take the coinbase color, the public colors of the person that they want to send it to, the amount, and they mix it all together. then they take that color and "sign" it with their private colors. that transaction with all the attached metadata is broadcast to the network and included in the block, and all the colors of the transaction are added together and used when creating the block's white color.

that is what allowed mtgox to be hacked, they were using the transaction hash as an ID to track balances rather than keeping track of the unspent outputs internally like the bitcoin client does.
honestly as a programmer, i thought the transaction malleability and unspent change bugs were kind of like heartbleed for bitcoin. and i would say most developers will look at something called "transaction id" and generally use it to track transactions.
the biggest problem i have here is that they built their own version of bitcoin and didn't decide to build in a check to make sure the wallet balances evened out. they didn't actually build a cold storage, that would have meant they would have had to build their own account / private key / address manager and ensure that available funds in the hot system were plus the funds in the cold system added up to their own account balances. 
if a warm fund to hot fund transaction happened that must mean that the total amount withdrawn since the last warm fund transaction should have added up. them not checking this is incredibly negligent for someone claiming they have a cold storage system.
tl;dr: karples was never competent enough to work with that much cash, he failed basic double entry bookkeeping on hot/cold storage.

agreed, the problem here is the idea of manipulating the protocol. it's like manipulating the constitution. but the alternative of not manipulating the protocol could also lead back to individuals needing to trust 'gatekeepers' to the financial system and those gatekeepers will end up making their own (buying on the margin/fractional reserve banking) rules, and that ends us back at square one.
i personally think hard forks are never a good idea. if you're going to build a standard, damn well stick to it and make it backwards compatible, especially if it's to be treated as a financial system. let the alt-coins increase the block size if they want.

I can imagine a few internet services that could benefit from P2P blockchain-powered internet services:
- Distributed DNS Authority
- Distributed SSL Certificate Authority
- Distributed PGP Authority
Then once that is set up, you could probably route network communications in a tor-like style, having the peer list validated by miners using a blockchain. In order to join the network, peers would need to come up with a hashcash that meets a certain timing criteria. Hopefully the protocol will have nodes randomly communicate random false data to other nodes in order to prevent traffic analysis.

I integrated the Coinbase payment plugin with a startup company I was working for named [Tealet]( I agree that the lack of a testnet is a huge problem.
One of our devs copy-pasted our dev server config file onto pastebin (he was trying to copy-paste between windows and a linux virtualbox image) which had our live authorization code, and Bitcoin was stolen. Strangely enough, we were able to contact the hacker via blockchain.info transaction messages and recover a portion of the stolen funds.
Coinbase has come a long way though, I added Coinbase to the site just as bitcoin was hitting the ~$130 mark. They've since implemented IP filtering and permission limitations which helps mitigate some of the threat. But they still definitely have a lot of work to do ahead of them.
Keep in mind Bitcoin is a whole new industry, all us devs working around this new technology are going to run into new problems. We get a rare chance at improving on an old and corroded system and help make the world a better place.

do the bank thing, but don't introduce bitcoin concepts at the very beginning. rather, teach them about double (triple?) entry bookkeeping. teach them about periodic (10 minute) backup snapshots. then once all that basic stuff is done, then you can introduce the concept of the blockchain by adding a "tracking hash" as an attribute to each of the snapshot backups. then you can introduce the concept of the coinbase by adding a "miner's wallet" attribute to each of the snapshop backups".

Namecoin is the DNS piece of the puzzle, integrating it with Tor is another. Tor is vulnerable to sybil attacks iirc, and I think the Tor folks manually maintain a blacklist.
An idea I've been thinking about is reducing network spam via the hashcash requirement. In order to join the Tor network as a node, you need to generate a hashcash that meets the network requirements (which could be something like the SHA256 of your private key, similar to a bitcoin address). If you request a huge data packet from server X, and need it to route from A to B to C to X, then the client needs to generate a hashcash from the challenge sent by server X that meets network requirements. Nodes A, B, and C are then rewarded when they "unwrap" the data packet and send it to the next node down the line. In order to prevent traffic analysis though, data must be sent in all directions to statistically mask the true recipient.

actually, what i think is happening is that the US dollar is experiencing a surge in value right now. it's not to say that the core value of bitcoin is changing, but rather the USD value is growing in comparison to other currencies.
if you look at the value of the euro vs usd, ruble vs usd, and yen vs usd, all these seem to be in a downtrend right now
why? i'm guessing that the US has managed to wipe out all the competing oil refineries in the world, and with economic sanctions on russia, the petrodollar is thriving once again. at least for a little while. that, or we just started processing the tar sands from canada / found some new natural gas source / have liberated the arctic oil.
if the price of oil in USD is low, then that means the US government is doing well in monopolizing the energy resources of the world.

the variable in this equation to keep in mind is time. bitcoin requires *continuous* energy usage to maintain the network, which gives bitcoin it's value. gold has one benefit: once mined, it does not require any additional energy to maintain its state (it doesn't corrode, etc). it's dense as fuck, so there is a high energy cost to make a transaction, but as a long term store of value, energy wise, it doesn't require extra energy. liquidity is of course a much bigger issue with gold as well, so you take your ups with your downs.
tl;dr: energy-wise, gold is like a savings account, and bitcoin is like a checking account, and both are better than the current financial infrastructure.
