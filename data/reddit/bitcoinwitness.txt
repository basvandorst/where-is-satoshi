"Payments with XRP settle in a few seconds, but if you buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin it will be cold by the time the payment has been settled." - Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple's chief executive
Hey Brad, you go ahead making XRP a coffee coin. For the rest of us theres VISA, Mastercard, Discover, AMEX,.....

Outlaws? Looks to me like Mexican Resistance aka Freedom Fighters for a anti hostile takeover, non-corporate controlled crypto-currency.
I suppose optics depends what side of the fence you are on.

Lol! Actually, soon as I hit save, I thought "Oh you must mean IN Ibiza!" Beautiful property though!  Now, where to find 1850 BTC.... :)

Definitely not the first property, but perhaps the most expensive. 
3.5 million USD property sold in Utah a few weeks ago and there have been a few condos and houses over the years which sold for BTC.

I suppose we can still go with any news is good news when it comes to Mainstream Media, unfortunately they still usually get things wrong.

I've been lurking here for 6 years.  It gets tiring seeing people fall for the same sort of dis-info FUD bullshit repeatedly. Your frustration with the illiterate who purposefully choose to spew before fact checking themselves is completely warranted. Thank you for your efforts.

Its somewhat concerning to note, the ID 2020 project is also co-sponsored by two other names we know;  Accenture and Rockefeller Foundation.  
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:41:12
I hear you there. And potentially worse is when you see the two other principle parties in the ID2020 initiative are Accenture and Rockefeller Foundation.
Makes me wonder...

The word "Bitcoin" appears 16 times in the article. Did you bother to read it?
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:06:20
I was going to say, its kinda giving me a headache, so it must be perfect. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:32:06
I only found 16 in the main article! Guess I need to practice up on my Word Hunt puzzle games. :(

Browsers can have processes running and not interacting with the desktop.  Malware can interact with those browser processes. Nice you have uBO.
Best thing to do is power off, boot something like Clonezilla or any imaging program to make a drive image.  Then start some forensics to identify all processes.  Consider the install untrustworthy from this point forward.
