Just use quadrigacx and purchase with etransfer or debit
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:09
Where is it at 19k? I see nearly 17k on most places 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:53:58
Quadrigacx hands down.  Next day etransfers - first one takes two days.  Today's was same day.  Requested just before 7am, funds at 4pm
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:06:52
Interac online is instant - just saying, get a BMO account just for that purpose is worth it

Quadrigacx hands Down for a Canadian.  Bad experience with coinbase 
Quad does next day e-transfer or rapid direct deposits.  A fee on both but very competitive and trustworthy 
Canadianbitcoins is not the best in terms of what they pay vs market.  And they don't like high volume

Made a few bucks with this cash bullshit, then re-bought some when it did the second pump, but I bought at the max that time and got screwed so I ate it for $400 Canadian.    Some Koreans are going to be suicidal over this shit, luckily for me, I can make that in a day working

Gotta ask, where'd you learn to setup the rig? What you running?
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:45:54
Find an exchange, register and verify .
Then slowly move some coins there, maybe 10-20 first and withdraw 
See if they're able to handle the volume. You may have to do it in short bursts like that.  They may let you sell them all and give you a cash balance, but the withdraws will be limited to probably &lt;100,000 at a time - probably daily

Stick with quadrigacx, the verification is taking up to two weeks because of heavy account registrations 
You can still send your btc there to trade and withdraw cash before being verified 
Also, the verification info was straight forward, so if you missed something - that's your fault
Coinbase is a pain for Canadians. And kraken is dying so keep away from them

Just paid $12 or so to move 0.2 btc, not that much IMHO, worked 4 conf in like an hour was over 600 satoshis per though 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:09:30
It fucking better

I've had more than this in and out of Blockchain wallets without issues.  Done the same from paper to online without issues.  I agree that someone here is right with saying you got malware somehow.  Maybe pop ups or software that was installed.  Not all the security updates done? Windows 7 IIRC is not supported by Microsoft anymore?  Perhaps you where compromised from the get go when you connected to the internet 
Sorry man

Profited about $3000 on a pittance of a $150 investment rolling it around back in 2014 was withdrawing several full value coins over about 6 months.  If I kept those coins until now - I'd be up over $80,000 Canadian.   Needed the money back then.  Never got back into it and I probably should have.   Looking at investing my profit shares at work into bitcoin again to hold for a couple years.  Trying to decide the safest way to store that kind of dollar value though
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:21:37
Should be 10, your balance at the block.  But not sure any legitimate and well know exchanges or wallets are going to support 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:43:57
Agree quadrigacx
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:49:24
Yeah evac the btc from kraken dude, they are going downhill from what I've read 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:38:38
Just had a baby, could use one! :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:30:35
You're sending $1,000,000 I'm assuming USD and are concerned about a high fee? Dude what the actual fuck.  Send at 1000 sat/byte and power that shit through to make sure it goes 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:57:47
A lot of people have been complaining about stuck funds and. On payment when cashing out, do a quick search on here
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:49:44
Hold and HODL 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:39:53
Use quad, recently Boyer to verify, took 8 days (including weekend). Due to high volume.  Was able to buy using interac online though and to transfer stuff from other wallets 
Withdraw with etransfer works without being verified too 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:38:01
Basically if the correction was more than what fees you pay on the exchange twice (selling and buying fee) then it's potentially worth it, but the value is different to each person

Got mine out at 495833 lol

I use them strictly to cash out as try pay next day to my banking (3 years ago anyway). Just spoke with them two days ago and they said they had to get more staff to keep up with this since more people are into crypto now
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:59:25
An exchange
