How am I supposed to trust you send the money?

None of my friends wanted to buy it - I’ve asked already.

Coinbase says this feature isn’t available in your country yet.

You can do an email bank transfer while using a bitcoin escrow service! Thank you!

You can still recover the funds though

I’m in BC, but I think I’ll see if any stores that accept BTC near me want to buy some.

Yes. Then HODL forever.

OP likely can’t. Very smart people with a lot of spare time can and do. It’s why we have Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and many others. And the people who make successful ones get rich, but there are also many unsuccessful ones.

It all depends on how long you hodl

For the same reason that you can’t use Monopoly money - nobody is willing to trade for it. Theoretically you could set up an exchange if you paid for the correct licenses and whatever other legal stuff they go through, then somehow advertise the new currency. There are only a few “recognized” currencies.

Well I have debt, so I’d like to pay off some of that, then maybe silver and clean energies. 
Edit: I hold eth and btc, so I’d probably also buy a very small amount of ltc. In this case, diversifying my investments isn’t about reducing risk, it’s about increasing opportunities - some coins occasionally spike independently. 
Edit 2: I’m also already net positive in crypto, so taking out say 25% and reinvesting 10-15% doesn’t seem like much of a risk.

I’m just sad I didn’t sell a little in late December so I could diversify/reinvest at a later date.

That’s like 60% off! What a sale!
