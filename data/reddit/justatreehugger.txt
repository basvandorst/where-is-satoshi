No, they didn't. 
Edit: why the hell am i getting downvoted? I'm not allowed to post facts now? And evoorhees above me says the same thing and gets upvoted? Seriously?

You're gonna do this every time a buttcoiner makes a post?
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:27:32
Exactly. And this is happening a lot lately. 
I have a feeling is involved in this. Looking at the people he tipped big amounts i'm quite certain there is something dodgy going on. 
Looking at some other threads he tipped in. Notice the title?
 click for the full title. 
Also the op just opened another thread where the way he writes suddenly changed. 
Ah well. Gullible Bitcoiners are gonna be gullible.

Are the 500 alt coins real money?
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:50:49
Can you point out one of them?

Your name and address isn't data? Mtgox, coinbase and the tons of people who lost coins because of hacks isn't data?

Sorry, as much as i love Bitcoin it isn't nearly on the same level as silver and gold and putting them in 1 sentence as if those are the 3 big investment options is just silly. 
There is no guarantee in any way that dumping of Dollars will make people move to Bitcoin. 
Edit: i'm fine with people downvoting me but at least be polite enough to explain. Where am i wrong?

People who pay with Bitcoin can also get their data hacked. 
Edit: can those who downvote me also explain why please?

This looks an awefully lot like a Bitcoiner trying to convince us how well tipping works. 
And it's not the first time i'm thinking this. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:42:25
No. You can't use that logic. You should tip based on what it's worth now. Nobody knows what the price will be 4 years from now. 
Tipping 2 cents is annoying. Tipping 2 cents and telling that person it will be worth more in 4 years is just really insulting.

This user is most likely connected to I think they might be the same person. Just like the other people he tipped big amounts. 
His writing style also changed compared to the other thread. He forgot to adjust it for this post. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:17:57
Yes, so what? Who cares!
Is this your first day on the internet or what? People post stuff on the internet. Get over it.

Did you just start a thread because a Buttcoiner said something somewhere or am i missing something?
