1.) Companies produces goods and services which have value. That is what is driving stock prices. And last I checked the Federal Government backs currency and I can use that currency to buy actual things. What can you buy with bitcoins? 
2.) [87% of bitcoins are owned by 1% of people who own bitcoins](

Never look back at investments you did or did not make. It will drive you mad. Sorry for your loss OP. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:51:30
Ha. Ok. Have a good one. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:24:46
... what does that mean?

Someone equated bitcoin to stock citing the greater fool theory. But a stock of a company is backed by the underlying value of the assets of the company not what the next person in line will pay you for it. The question is what is the backing of the price of a bitcoin? Not some bullshit cookie cutter non-answer about feeling enslaved in our current financial system. Bitcoins are doing exactly what they set out to avoid at this point. Very few people hold the vast majority of coins.

Except behind the price of a stock is an actual company with assets. What is behind the price of a BTC?

You're doing it wrong. This is reddit where we blindly lump all unions in to one box and shit on them. Who care's if they are one of the only groups who actively support a living wage? 
DAE hate the 1%?

Her name is Liliana and she most certainly exists. You said it was a Federal crime, but not a Federal crime that would be prosecuted. If a tree falls in the woods and there is no one around to hear it; does it make a sound? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:08:03
I'll let FedEx, UPS, and DHL know they don't exist. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:10:10
Can you print that out and  FedEx me a copy?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:44:40
You think I can get her charged with a Federal crime? You seem to be an expert on this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:19:58
So you can FedEx me a copy of how there is a monopoly, but not really.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:29:38
Yeah. Overnight it. I'll be waiting by my door for the UPS guy. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:40:50
Yeah. I've literally never had anyone other than USPS workers leave something in my mailbox. The eight year old neighbor girl must have gotten special permission  from the Post Master General to put that dog walking flyer in there.  If not though you think I can have her prosecuted? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:45:12
But there are a bunch of other options for mail. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:53:36
Neat. Can I find the info on this strictly enforced monolopy on FedEx, or UPS's website? I'm always looking to learn new things.

The technology is great. But is BTC? Maybe it will be another coin.

Found the guy buying at $19k.
