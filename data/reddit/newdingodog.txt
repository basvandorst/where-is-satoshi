What does "put it in banks" mean?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:51:35
Isn't bullion only guaranteed for an incredibly small amount? Like 1oz is $20 USD?
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:40:25
Lol, like noobs moving around .09 bitcoin at a time will trigger some crazy meltdown.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:25:07
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:21:06
Isn't the blockchain totally public anyway?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:41:03
Why would the developers want something that is bad for the network as a whole? Wouldn't their financial, emotional, and reputation based incentives be aligned with what is good for bitcoin as a whole?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:27:04
The price that someone else is willing to pay the moment someone decides to sell some.

@_date: 2017-11-01 22:28:20
Yea, I am curious about this as well. People were saying you cannot spend 2x coin without risking your BTC. But if you transfer to coinbase they will split it for you. Who knows if that will be successful though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:31:54
s2x is cancelled?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:54:35
I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:01:00
I have asked technical questions a few times in comments and threads and there was never a ton of interest.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:25:43
People were talking about lack of replay protection and how it is best to not transfer the S2X coins right away. Wouldn't this be a good way to be able to sell your S2C coins quickly?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:55:39
I don't understand the alternative. They are a subversive group pretending to be interested in this technology and have now hijacked its future and are destroying it from within?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:58:54
I don’t understand the comments about replay protection then.
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:37:12
Wow, how insecure you must be to jump to this conclusion.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:00:46
Thanks, edited. It was just my first name, right? Yea, I don't know either. It says "Connecting to peers" in the GUI.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:24:29
Why is Mycelium/Electrum not considered a third party?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:27:09
Yea, I exited, restarted computer, uninstalled and re-installed. I could try uninstalling and deleting blockchain data, but would rather not :).
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:49:34
Bitcoin is being used as a payment system in many use cases.

Seems like not? 3900 now.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:30:24
Can't you just set one below and one above and then cancel?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:42:28
Yes, this is why the price fluctuates. How else do you think the price would be set?
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:09:48

What do you mean consolidation?

Wouldn't he then have equal coins in the now successful fork? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:33:33
What is your measure of "most innovative country in the world"?

He is interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:33:03
I see the logic train now.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:22:49
It literally is a topic of discussion since we are discussing it right now!
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:10:14
Seems like not? 3900 now.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:00:58
Not exactly sure. Last time there was a fork, there were guides on how to sell one and get the other. No the fork has not happened yet.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:26:18
I looked at the logs and saw a lot of errors like this:
    2017-09-18 04:10:12 GUI:   OpenType support missing for script 17
Any help? Thanks for checking it out in any case.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:38:59
How do you invest in bitcoin short term without using bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:34:15
Some people consider Coinbase sufficient for keeping large sums of bitcoin. They think that the brand and security of Coinbase enough to keep their coins safe.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:08:31
People who bought a few hundred bucks worth a year or two ago?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:07:50
Unsure at this point. If you have the private keys you will get equal of both. Impossible to tell how the prices will turn out. It seems in the past week that the 2x is loosing some support but hard to tell if that it propaganda / bias. I haven't heard anything really convincing either way.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:42:28
Yes, this is why the price fluctuates. How else do you think the price would be set?
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:10:38
That is leveraging the risk since you are betting on bitcoin itself and their ability to run a company.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:04:40
I am not seeing how the "security" is relevant to the goal of improving the health of the network.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:24:06
Is it simple to get the forked coins off the hardware wallets event though you don't have direct access to the private keys?
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:25:36
Odd to say currency is unaffordable, but I get ya. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:41:20
Yea, I have a feeling it might be something with that peer. I deleted peers.dat and hoped it would sort it out, but no luck. I will try and run from command line with some flags and see if that will fix it. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:39:12
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:31:00
The percentage of transactions that are using segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:21:20
Well at a high level, the fork is a duplication of the ledger. There are, at the time of the for, 2 duplicate ledgers. Now the fork happens and they are two non compatible blockchains that share all transactions in the past. You have the same amount of in both blockchains. There will be certain ways to transfer one or the other if you want to "sell out". I am no expect so I might have some of the details wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:57:05
Okay, well then the next logical question is why do their rules say so.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:36:52
The people who would be struggling are not driving up bitcoin now. In the event of global chaos and warring governments, bitcoin could be seen as a store of wealth and a way to transact between people in different countries, even those at war with one another.
I don't have strong opinions either way, but If I had to guess, I would say that bitcoin would go up in a time of crisis, similar to gold. The argument "do you really think people will be buying gold over food when times are tough" ignores the fact that when "times are tough" they aren't tough for wealthy investors.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:08:04
What the heck is that idea based on. That is like saying "Apple share price should at least be a weeks pay in Singapore." Makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:27:18
What if some of the minor users are miners? And what if some of the minor miners are minors? Should we make sure they have parental permission?
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:30:45
Segwit and Segwit2x are different. One was soft fork and on core and the later is the hard "hostile" fork.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:21:57
Yea, I suppose I don't understand why that is the case. Does the node not check and verify others' transactions?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:44:03
Yea all that missed profit of low cost index funds is going to kill them.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:17:08
I can't get past downloading all the blocks. Keep erroring out around 85 percent.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:33:46
I have not done specific port forwarding, I can look into it. I am not sure if you can re-index from GUI. Can I run what I downloaded from the command line?
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:08:43
What if the alternative is they don't make any money?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:16:24
Good idea to check but I believe I had it on an external. The client itself was on the c drive. I will investigate, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:16:40
This is the topic of discussion here. If you don't care to discuss it, why not refrain from posting? You can pretty much shut any conversation down with "Who cares / Who knows".
