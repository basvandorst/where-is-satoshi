are you, by any chance, a Nigerian prince?
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:08:34
it will get close to 7k for sure
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:35:05
doesn't surprise me at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:04:36
and what happens if he's right?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:25


a year has more days than 16
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:11:38
Are you even serious?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:43:37
talking like a true gambler
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:36:08
Wait till it gets to 3k
@_date: 2019-11-14 10:07:19
God heard your prayers
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:35:22
there is no way to distinguish lost wallets to non lost wallets, so it's impossible to recover lost bitcoins
@_date: 2019-10-17 01:49:13
Exactly, you know nothing
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:08:05
Where can I get one of those
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:05:01
Coinbase is pretty good
@_date: 2019-12-09 08:09:54
2021 - $1M
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:59:10
It indeed is my friend.
@_date: 2019-12-05 05:02:47
What if they trick us into accepting a harmful update, by making it seem like a positive update?
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:04:49
This just means I can buy more
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:11:37
I would sure love to buy the dip
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:16:20
Are you even kidding
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:07:11
Why are you trying to convince people to buy BTC in the first place, if they don't understand it then they shouldn't own it
@_date: 2019-12-17 04:39:13
The problem with that is nobody can know if the price will be lower, then if you sold, you just lost money
@_date: 2019-12-09 01:09:25
Don't send anything.
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:23:02
Exactly. Only the ones that invested what they can't afford to lose are worried
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:28
you were saying...?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:23:29
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:37
this has nothing to do with the "ban"
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:08:47
sir u are indeed a very stable genius
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:16:50
man if it's reddit what made you realize that.. you shouldn't leave facebook then
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:31:06
not really. best decision would have been to sell at 19k+
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:40
isn't the opposite?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:24:32
it's over
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:36:35
say that again when it's worth 100k
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:42:41
but there are hints
@_date: 2018-07-28 09:26:59
it's the slogan of the recently elected president, Iván Duque.
@_date: 2018-07-28 09:30:45
complete bullshit, i'm colombian 
@_date: 2018-07-28 09:29:32
seems different from the one in the photo
