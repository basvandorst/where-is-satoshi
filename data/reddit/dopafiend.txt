As a means to move it into Dollars I understand
But you should encourage nobody to put any savings that they are relying on in Bitcoin.
Like it or not, Bitcoin is still gambling for the time being, if you want to hold assets the dollar, or even the argentine peso, is still a better choice.
@_date: 2012-06-20 21:48:59
Wait, are you actually discussing gold standard/no gold standard or is this just a rant? I'm confused.
@_date: 2012-04-17 04:46:52
Well, TOR is very much held to be secure, and there is zero info, leads, suspicions, nothing about government involvement.
But, if you ask me, that's exactly how they want it, and I absolutely believe they are in a position to infiltrate it if they wanted to.
But, I don't think their after small time drug dealers, whoever's got the access is probably much more interested in foreign intelligence. 
@_date: 2012-03-13 18:47:00
Obviously. This is theoretical, not actually applied to the bitcoin.
You said if one person held all of a currency it would lose all it's value. This isn't true, a fixed exchange can hold a currency up when instituted by someone or something large enough to support a guarantee.
@_date: 2012-02-25 00:25:37
Lol @ Bitcoin being some how relevant at all in global wealth transfer.
Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin for what it is, but we're talking about .0000000001 % of the equation here and this is written like its somehow relevant to the economy.
And what, like any global economy is going to run on an unregulated fixed amount currency like bitcoin? Give me a break.
Like it or not, proper regulation and currency fluctuation/growth are essential to an actual global currency.
@_date: 2012-06-20 21:14:37
Why are bitcoins such a hotbed for this stuff, you don't honestly think we should bring back the gold standard do you?
@_date: 2012-03-12 05:08:17
Lol, not to be rude but a *state*, tying themselves to the bitcoin?
It's just completely out of the question, the Krona is broken and it would still be more respected than the bitcoin.
Also nobody today would instate a non-fiat currency as a national currency, there's a reason we dropped the gold standard.
The euro is absolutely the best option for them.
@_date: 2012-03-24 01:28:27
Yes, definitely this.
There are people who are successful at day trading and those people operating a data farm for their analysis with automatic trade execution on the floor, all you are doing at home is gambling.
@_date: 2012-04-17 04:28:18
It's pretty much a certainty that somewhere deep in the NSA/CIA they've got a good grip on any weaknesses in TOR or have effectively infiltrated the network to a great enough extent.
But I also doubt they found anything in this case via TOR and it was probably the money trail. The tor weaknesses they'll save, and play that card carefully.

Yes, even though the current system is flawed and failing, fiat currencies still have an advantage.
Fractional reserve banking and reasonable inflation are both beneficial factors in an economic system. Growth is far too limited with a fixed currency like the bitcoin will be.
There is very good reason we unhitched the dollar from the gold standard, fiat currencies themselves, with central controlling agencies (the fed) are a good thing when managed properly.
Simply making a fixed monetary system, with a fixed amount of money has severe drawbacks. The progression (which we already seeing in the bitcoin market) is for this money to get sucked upped into accounts/holders and spending stops. Liquidity freezes up, markets slow down(this is happening right now at Mt.gox, volume is crap because everybody's holding) and the market starts to seize.
This effect is known throughout any fixed capital system, even in something as abstract as a fixed ratio economy bittorrent tracker, it's quite repeatable that there is an inevitable regression in liquidity and even private bittorent trackers have to inject supplemental ratio into their economies to counteract this.
@_date: 2012-02-25 15:19:35
Now back to fractional reserve banking
From Wikipedia:


**Now tell me a little more clearly, how fractional reserve banking does not increase money supply when that is the exact effect it has**
@_date: 2012-06-12 15:24:47
Oh c'mon, this is just silly.
This subreddit is full of this crap.
Bitcoin is interesting, but it's total market is like .00000000001% of the dollar or euro, it's in no position to take over from those currencies in the coming years.
@_date: 2012-03-13 17:49:56


Just kidding, but really, I think the reason the Fed/nsa has stayed hands off with bitcoin is that it's not worth blowing their cover over the little guys buying drugs, but they're definitely watching the large movements for activity like this.
@_date: 2012-04-18 13:48:48
Yeah, they certainly aren't what many people in here make them out to be.
@_date: 2012-06-18 05:51:03
One of two reasons:
1. Maybe they're concerned about security, any time you have a known recipient of a large amount of coins this makes them the target of possible malicious attacks, like we've seen with bitcoinica. As opposed to traditional finance, which is already available without concern of attacks(paypal).
2. Possibly wanting to avoid any undue attention, although bitcoins are an autonomous system, there are certainly government agencies, monitoring, researching, and generally keeping tabs on the entire bitcoin economy. Torrent trackers have many reasons to do all they can to just keep the eye off their back, the advantage of accepting bitcoins simply isn't worth the added attention.
@_date: 2012-06-12 17:31:22
It is allowed to compete!
It will stay where it is, probably experience some modest growth, but remain more of a novel currency than an investment.
I don't really know what to say to you, the chances of a mass movement to bitcoin? Do you know how fucking big economies are?
Bitcoin is less than a rounding error when you even look at some of the smaller movements in major economies, zoom back to the full scale bitcoin pretty much doesn't exist.
And then what, you really think the world would stably run on a fixed capital currency?
Don't fall down the pit of the gold standard nuts, fiat currencies have a role and a purpose, we need fiat currencies, they are what allow us to hold any remote stability in an economy and to control the money supply.
You need to be able to inject capital into the system to keep it flowing, at a a controlled rate, in a fixed capital system like the bitcoin would be(everything would be mined in short order, leaving a fixed amount of coins) there is an inevitable regression of liquidity, the economy would begin to seize.
I suggest you read up a little on monetary theory before jumping on the post-fiat bandwagon.
@_date: 2012-06-12 20:38:22
Sort of to put it a better way, i don't think bitcoins staved equilibrium is anywhere near a currency like the dollar/euro, nor will it be.
Many people here seem to foresee a future whee bitcoins is the main trading currency, and I'm saying fat chance that'll ever happen.
@_date: 2012-03-13 18:09:38
It's a joke man.
@_date: 2012-03-15 15:41:17
Ok, so, first of all, nobody would call this "hill", it's far further from the definition of [hill]( than [slope](
But most of all, it's not even like I'm the one calling it a slope, it's called an order book slope. Here, look, google [order book slope]( now google [order book hill]( Which one do you think is the proper term?
@_date: 2012-04-17 05:17:25
That's exactly what I mean by playing that card carefully.
@_date: 2012-03-14 17:36:05
The two slopes are the current orders, you can hover over the line to see the volume and price.
@_date: 2012-04-04 07:56:14
I'll be surprised if this ever makes it off the ground.
Notice the "looking for investors" component here.

You don't think purchasing a house deserves taxation?
@_date: 2012-03-15 04:47:25
I don't understand how you are saying it's different than a standing order slope.


Yes, exactly, it's a slope, signifying all the standing orders, which tells you how many orders there are at each price.
For instance, to buy 15,000 coins immediately right now, your ending orders will be approx. 5.50 per coin.
@_date: 2012-02-25 05:10:43
Fractional reserve banking is a key fixture  to growth in my opinion. It's an often overlooked fact that when a bank lends out a loan, it's effectively creating most of this money, this injection of capital is what drives growth and liquidity in the market.
A fixed amount of currency will drive a regression to a lack of spending. It's interesting to watch this effect in private BitTorrent trackers fixed ratio economies. They always have to implement "freeleech's" just to inject ratio capital into the economy to keep it flowing and keep spending up.
I belief this all falls under the general category of Keynesian economics as pointed out to me elsewhere in the bitcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2012-02-21 17:13:47
No, it wouldn't be bad. I'm just rather indifferent about it, I doubt I'd actually be inclined to purchase anything in bitcoins.
If you mine coins I could see the advantage, but I don't, just exchange, so it would be an unnecessary step when I can already buy in USD.
@_date: 2012-03-13 17:47:36
Yes, but there's still an actual cap.
Obviously the last bitcoins would start to split infinitely if someone where to try it, but in theory, you could buy all the bitcoins and literally own the bitcoin.
At that point it would either collapse or you could setup your own guaranteed exchange and tie it to the dollar or euro or something.
@_date: 2012-02-21 17:08:49
I'm actually pretty happy with the current situation, it would be kind of cool if someone like Amazon let you use bitcoins, but not that great, and I wouldn't really see the point.
I guess I'm kind of in the minority here, many people seem like they'd like bitcoins to replace fiat currencies all together. I actually quite support fiat currencies, they're a valuable part of modern economics, and not just the current economics, but theoretical economics as well.
I just like bitcoins for what they are, an anonymous untraceable form of currency easily transferred on the internet without oversight. I don't want them to actually be standard currency.
@_date: 2012-04-18 01:51:28
What many people don't understand is this isn't just some power grab to take away the right to use cash, this a serious and prevalent problem in southern Europe.
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece... the cash economy isn't just people dodging taxes on used cars here and there, it's literally a major underground economy that goes untaxed. People will buy 70% of a fucking house in cash just to dodge the taxes. Hundreds of thousands of dollars passing hands and it's so ingrained in the system that it's just assumed, accountants will literally turn a blind eye in the same room as two people count a couple hundred grand through an electronic counter before closing a deal.
So no, it's not just an attack on cash, it's a major problem in their economy and they have decided something needs to be done.
If you think this is some kind of downfall of the fiat currency, it's not, it's a rightful fix of a major problem.
@_date: 2012-04-17 16:58:58
Ah, wasn't aware.
@_date: 2012-06-12 19:43:47
But it's exactly those instabilities that wouldn't let it take any sort of dominance in the first place.
Once it started seizing you'd have a mass exodus and the bottom would drop out of the market.
It's in a viable position already, peoples ideas of it taking over the dollar or euro are just a pipe dream.
It's like the gold standard, it appeals only to the most rudimentary understanding of an economic system, in reality fiat currencies are superior.
We need better managed fiats, not the abolishment of fiats.

@_date: 2012-03-13 17:54:14
Unless they setup their own exchange.
They could either control the market themselves, say around $5, and everyone would trust that they'll keep buying them back at $5 if you don't want them anymore.
Or they could tie it too the dollar, make it exactly $5 and all coins come with a contract agreeing that at any time they can be exchanged for $5.
This is how the Chinese yuan is traded, the governments sets a fixed exchange rate, agreeing to buy or sell whatever people want at the rate they set it at.

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:15:31
Well yeah, by valuation I mean what do people think it's worth in USD, what's it trading at.
The difference between a solid valuation and a false one is how stable it is.
We knew $14 was a pretty solid valuation, everyone agreed for a long time that they were worth that, all the way up to $30 we had a pretty stable valuation.
Then it went parabolic, and it's been up and now down, so we can't say this is a stable valuation.

I agree wait staff need to get min wage(they do in CA!) and that min wage needs to be liveable but there's actually a reason a standard tip makes sense.
If you have no standard tip, then tipping can only be used to express satisfaction. If they're just going to give you average service then why not give you shit service? no tip either way.
But if you have a standard tip, you now can express satisfaction or dissatisfaction. If they're just in an average mood they know they still need to make sure they don't give you shit service or they risk losing this tip.

There is inflation of the supply, very slowly.

HA omg the irony.
I've been around bitcoin for some time now, since around the last time it hit $3.50.
So far there is little to no evidence of it staking it's place as a currency that's actually used for goods and services.
(I'm sorry, a few online merchants here and there selling luxury goods doesn't count)
Bitcoin's entire rise has been speculatory driven by people who want to make actual fiat bills.
It was far more suited to applications like africa when it was relatively stable at $14.
Right now, the best option for africans is what they do all ready, unofficially use USD as a safe haven currency.
Don't mean to burst your bubble(ha) but if you think, right now, that bitcoin is more stable than the leading fiats you are delusional.

If you set aside the semantic difference, the real difference is the lack of a centrally issuing authority or central bank controlling the supply.
It's just free floating.
Most people think of dollars as just "there's this many dollars" but it's far far more complex than that and the supply is always being modulated.
@_date: 2013-10-10 03:04:16
Completely disagree.
Maybe speculators and developers and people holding bitcoins, sure.
But people actually using them? Actually exchanging them for goods? The overwhelming majority are using them because they're anonymous.
You people buying a beer or ordering a pair of socks or whatever with bitcoin aren't holding a candle to the markets created that leverage bitcoin for it's anonymity.

You can't explain or argue it out of being a crash.
Look at the chart, it is a crash, there's not semantic or ideological reason that makes what happened not a crash.
If you want to say it's not significant or that it's not a big hurdle that's fine, but it's still a crash.

Bitcoins are definitely a gateway currency.
Sure it starts out simple, you'll buy a few coins on the weekends, it's lighthearted and techie, nothing big, BAM, before you know you're in Gold all week long, your head spins round and round like mobius ticker tape, smartphone constantly loading, gotta get one more trade, just trying to catch that bubble once again. Eventually they find you in the gutter, clutching an account full of Mongolian Tugriks, you're mumbling something nobody can understand...*the minerals...the industry...it's coming* but you're too far gone, they toss you in the loony bin. It's finally done. Silence.

No, the grey market exchange of dollars would be more viable as a primary currency.
Like the Liberian dollar, just peg your currency to the dollar, you're susceptible to the interest rates of the US but it's far more stable than any standalone currency in an unstable region.

No way. There is a chance of losing it if the market crashes.

This is an advantage for the dollar though, the money supply can be controlled so you can nudge inflation into where you want it.
Bitcoin would just go deflationary if it saw widespread adoption and we already know the problems with deflationary currencies.

I know I am, I messed around around $3.50 to $5 and made a couple hundred dollars and got out.
It was pretty tough to see 50 bitcoins or so that I was bouncing back and forth at the time suddenly be 10k.

Bitcoin is being ran by these people now, the idea of it's actual implementation is still whimsical fancy.
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:10:58
This is a bit of an overstated claim.
It all really stems from the Betamax/VHS claim, which is widely known but actually disputed.
And don't forget, the porn industry threw itself at HD-DVD and that lost.
It just seems like they pick the winners because they are so adaptable, they will migrate to whatever's working, they moved to Blu-ray right after it started taking off.
@_date: 2013-05-19 10:27:04
The dollar isn't backed, except for by the people. Because the people value the dollar. That's how fiats work.
The dollar is controlled though, by the Federal Reserve, which is what allows us to control our money supply, keeping inflation where we want it and stopping the currency from going deflationary like bitcoin would.

Bullshit, gold has always and will always be valuable at some level. It's probably the one fucking thing that would retain value in a post apocalyptic world, as it did in prehistory.
Hell, gold is like the original fucking bitcoin, there's a set amount of it, you can mine for it but all the easy stuff's been mined and now you have to run expensive operations for diminishing returns. And despite having little practical use people value it because it has value that can be exchanged for other things.
Gold is pretty much the success story of a novel value store that Bitcoin could only dream of one day holding a pitiful tiny candle to.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:24:58


Really? A currency that took on all this valuation over the last month and you think people are selling just "because of fears of the future".
It doesn't even cross your mind that this may have been a false valuation?
There hasn't been healthy growth since $30, that's all we have as far as a stable value of bitcoin, $30.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:26:34
Well another issue is that it's tough to experience widespread growth and generation of wealth with fixed capital.
Fractional reserve banking allows us to create wealth when it's needed. It's got good and bad aspects, but the growth we've experienced since unchaining from gold wouldn't have been possible on the gold standard.
Most of all, a fixed capital monetary system has an inevitable regression of liquidity.
It get's sucked up into large stores and the amount being spent gets smaller and smaller, eventually sort of drying up.
Most of us grow up with the idea of money as this fixed thing, there's a certain amount of it, you work for some and you get it, and then you trade it for something else.
Money functions better as a sort of hydraulic fluid, it needs to be pumped, what you want is a central authority that controls the flow, pumping it in where it's needed, recouping it where there's overflow.
This all goes against most of what bitcoin supporters think, they say we need a fixed store of value. I say we need a fluid conduit, we lose sight of the end goal, a system where we can all work towards prosperity for ourselves along with everyone else, money is just a tool in that goal.
Edit: take my words with a grain of salt, monetary theory is simply a passing curiosity of mine, I'll probably get my shit pushed in a second from now from someone with an economics degree.
Sometimes economics degrees represent a person with a vast understanding and appreciation for the underlying concepts of money, and sometimes they just represent somebody that knows all the details of the current paradigm and are unable to see beyond it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:20:59
Lol @ non fiat becoming primary currency.
That's has always been the biggest oversight among people here as well as people who think the gold standard is a good idea, do you know how valuable a central bank is?
Currencies need to be modulated for the common good, which is what a central bank does. Just because the one we have now may be corrupt, may not be good doesn't make them any less valuable of a concept.
Not directing this all at you OP, I know you're just entertaining the idea.

Fractional reserve banking is a key part of modern economies, one of the main reasons I don't think bitcoin could succeed as a primary currency.

Don't listen too closely to the word around here, people are whacked out.
Nobody can say for sure, there's no defining aspect until it's over.
Arguably this entire thing has been a bubble, bitcoin hasn't seen healthy grown trends since $30.
Some will tell you that this is all one big price correctment, and that bitcoins actual values is already 300+, these people ~~are fucking stupid~~ really believe in the currency and think that it is going to establish itself as a safe haven commodity like gold.

I'm talking about taking USD out of it, Bitcoins in from customers, USD out from the exchange, most businesses don't generally like sitting on a ton of volatile currency as capital.

Central banks are not a joke.
Just because our current on may be, doesn't make the concept.
Money is a tool, people, not a resource.
All of this desire for a non-fiat reserve currency is just an infantile desire to return to money as people thought they understood it.
Rather than tackle the complex system that they don't understand, they just want to put the system they thought they understood.
