Really? I think maybe we're a bit late for that. I think almost everyone has _heard_ of it at this point.

Doesn't mean they won't use that to arrest/jail people

If we wanted to solve the hard drug problem, we would decriminalize all drugs. Portugal did this 15 years ago and their overall addiction rates for all drugs dropped in half. Turns out people will seek help more often when they're not afraid of getting arrested. We should treat drugs as a public health problem, not a criminal problem. It's absolutely foolish that we don't.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:21:23


Oh like the CEOs of all those banks that got bailed out to the tune of trillions after making fraudulent investments? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:43:02
Perhaps, that's not a terrible argument. But if we decriminalized selling them, then they'd be more likely to get a regulated supply of quality drugs, so there would be less overdose deaths and so on from poor quality control or lots of harmful additives.
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:09:18
Right, but they're given with that stipulation because they need to justify selling a lot, because it's a "jobs program" to the military-industrial complex that makes the MRAPs and other equipment.

Agreed. But the chilling effects of this knowledge do actually prevent a lot of people from saying what they want to say, so it functions as a mechanism for control. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:15:50
Yup, typical "disproportionate retribution" type of narrative. Same narrative that Israel uses to justify invading Palestine. "Oh no, they shot a rocket at us and it landed in an empty field, better blow up 1000 of their buildings and kill hundreds of them!"
The disproportionate retribution narrative is even in the bible, in the story of Adam and Eve, to explain why humans have sin. All humans have sin _forever_ because some guy and girl ate a fruit once. Talk about disproportionate retribution. 
This stupid type of narrative is ingrained in our culture, and a lot of people still buy in to it, especially when it's used to support the power of an existing authority. But really it's just used to justify crimes and keep people pacified.

OH yeah, because regular citizens totally have millions of dollars just laying around
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:06:38
They're out there, do some searching. I can't present them to you on a silver platter unfortunately, it's something you must piece together yourself. There are no Newsweek or Time or Salon articles about this, that talk about it in a real way. But read about Skull and Bones society and the rituals they do. Read about Bilderberg Meeting's final big shows. I don't know that much about it, but it does seem like satanic rituals play a role in some of the more powerful secret societies. They may not explicitly call them satanic, but they're often obviously malevolent, and not derived from any mainstream ritual that may exist in Christianity or any other well known cultural rituals. Stuff like faking sacrifice of a child, things that give them an emotional rise and make them feel as though they're the ones with secret knowledge that no one else has, because they get to experience these special rituals. It's one of those things I'm confident they would say normal people "just wouldn't understand." Because they're psychopaths and we're not. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:59:06
Yes, exactly. Do not cut in on the government's territory.

They are creating profiles on each of us.

Yes, Americans have been wildly successful from the 1940s to the 2000s, so they developed a blind trust of the system that caused this to happen. Baby Boomers are especially like this. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:01:57
It's defended by the largest police, prison, and military systems in the world. So I think lots of people are just waiting until it's certain there are enough on board, because the response is going to be _very_ heavy-handed and we all know it, which is why Americans seem so meek and disinterested in fixing this, at least when viewed from the outside. I'm sure it'll all erupt in a fit of rage one day, that's kind of how we do things in America. Bottle it up until it boils over in a giant explosion of emotion. Individually, as well as in society as a whole. 
That's what these Baltimore and Ferguson riots were all about, people just had enough. "Riots are the language of the unheard" as MLK said. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:57:14
They're also agent provacateurs that create the appearance of the necessity for police violence. The police are eager to use their equipment, so they can keep it (MRAPs must be returned within 6 months if not used) and this creates police violence. If the police can be made to look bad, which creates a narrative of "we should disband police and federalize them", which would effectively privatize them through federal contracts. The private military companies are itching to take advantage of this profit opportunity. Just wanted to add that to what you said, which is 100% spot-on. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:20:08
Well there kind of is, actually, but it's a bit more outlandish-sounding and not really relevant to the main topic. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:51:18
True, you bring up a relevant point. I'm pretty sure Portugal has a nationalized healthcare system like any sane developed country does, so it's not an expensive ordeal for the citizen to go through rehab, which probably helped lower the addiction rates quite a bit. Again, them smartly treating it as a public health problem that affects everyone, instead of a criminal problem. Portugal has a lot of problems, but that's one they're way ahead of everyone else on.

And you believe what the FBI says... why? The FBI has been involved in more cover-ups than a twin-size comforter.
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:00:26
I honestly don't think that's a super useful strategy. A better plan is to change the culture so everyone knows to distrust people in positions of power.

Every person in the world is. That's the whole problem.

You don't go to jail for it. It's not legalized, just decriminalized. I think you can still get a steep fine if you are caught selling. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:13:48
Eh, maybe. I think they just wanted to make an example out of this guy. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:03:03
I agree 100%. But they are creating profiles of us, which can later be used to incriminate us. You're in a protest, suddenly those laws you broke in 2006 become relevant and you get arrested. That sort of thing. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:52:06
And the prisons profit off it, and the police profit off it, and the judges profit off it, and the congressmen get bribed by the police and prisons, so they like it... so anyone who could do anything about it, won't. The greasing of a million palms can bend the arc of morality quite far.
