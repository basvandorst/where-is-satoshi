Ver is a good marketer and he knows that is an easy route to get the message across but Bcash is the fork that was caused to change the network. btc sat there like 'increase blocksize? Nah, why would we ever do that it dont say that in the whitepaper'

you're talking about it from a tech perspective, right? bro, that race has been run. other cryptos were invented specifically to surpass the challenges that bitcoin faced and since their inception many od the best developers around the world have all piled  on the project because they see the infinite possibilities of the protocol layer.
this simply isn't btc. instead of scaling and developing the btc community has spent the last 7 years setting up mass mining operations and exchanges. it laid the ground work, but the tech is antiquated. in a sector based on bleeding edge technological advancements, I don't see how it can possibly continue to thrive

Smart contracts. Securing and running the network without miners.  They're not out yet but the plans are in place and the developments are well underway. Sure the race hasn't completely ended, but its a marathon and BTC has been sitting at the starting line because "muh whitepaper" is the gospel of the lord.
