So he left no note, yet you're declaring to the public that he killed himself because of BTC?
If you're telling the truth (it's the internet no one lies for karma!) then I'm sorry for your loss.
If you're lying, get a hobby. Like crypto! Never too late.

This is ironically and hysterically accurate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:08
Definitely did save you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:29:58
Valid points. I can make it look I have millions in my HTML non-protected website as well!
Good catch.

It's a fucking scam. They KNOW this causes FOMO and cuts the market down. I'm sure they've got their insiders buying up cheap BTC whilst we're all freaking out missing out.

What's different about it this time around? I read it yesterday. I trade crypto and your round numbers are very suspicious.

I'm no professional trader or investor. However my two pence would inch towards the lack of exposure that Bitcoin holds globally?
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:53:23
Depends. Are you above 18? Will you be using the currency for illicit purposes?
Do you live in the USA? Canada? Europe?
Valid ID? Bank account? VISA card? And finally, quantities?
All these things matter. Feel free to omit answers to any questions above. I'll reply with what I can.

Hold it buddy. Give it time. Patience is key! Pretend that coin doesn't exist.
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:57:44
Going to PM you as I believe that is safest for both our privacies!
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:12:19
Efficiency is more important to some than others!
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:10:08
Anyway to be noticed when they're stocked?
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:07:13
Pretty broad statement no? Seems counter intuitive.. Wouldn't that individual immediately lose equity on every transaction as the price continues to drop? Just getting into this forgive me if it's an ignorant question.
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:03:17
Isn't Rocket cheaper than Athena?
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:07:22
Thanks for the description!
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:01:04
Such a dumb relation. A hundred years ago a train robber would steal bank notes and cash off a moving train. I don't see anyone linking train robberies against the dollar. Ugh. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:50:57
Haha ayyyy 
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:08:41
Does buy low not apply to ATM's? It says on the receipts you got the one's on Rocket ATM for cheaper..
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:27:47
That's 50 BTC buddy not 5000.
I think you mean $1 = .0054 BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:27:13
It's always going to cost you 1-2 bucks even if it's just $2 you're sending. Unless fees go down.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:46:40
Isn't saying $0.54 the same as saying 54 cents?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:32:32
Thanks for struggling through that with me.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:35:38
Alright I confess, I'm not too great at math.
Can you tell me how him saying
1 BTC = $0.54
is equal to
.0054 BTC = $1
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:31:04
How is it not? Lol 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:29:45
Alright I'm convinced you're fucking with me I'm not this retarded.
Edit: Holy fuck wait. Ok. I get what you're saying. 1.0 cent is the same as .01 geez this shit was complicated.
Thanks for struggling through that with me.
