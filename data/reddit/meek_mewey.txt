I wonder how many would just buy bitcoin with their UBI. Think of the potential price then.
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:20:08
The disadvantages of implementing UBI early, pale in comparison to those of starting it too late.

Yangs the most pro crypto, and the only one who has even the faintest understanding of the technology and its potential implications.

I believed it will compete with gold in terms of MC. So it just feels like a safe bet to keep buying until it gets close.  I also feel that long term, nation backed money will start to fade. The US govt has become corporatized and it only makes sense that corps will start issuing currency ie Libra. This should increase the demand for “decentralized” alternatives.

I’d say more like $1 = 0.92. But you get 1000 x 0.92’s at the start of the level
