Quick and efficient is exactly right!  Although there is a tiny bit of room for creativity.  And because every case is different, it is nearly always interesting.  I consider myself lucky.
I do keep improving... especially in efficiency.  What used to take weeks/months now takes hours/days.

Not really... I mean, do you mean for point-of-sale transactions?  Most zero confirmations that hit the network, nearly instantly, are trustworthy.  Double spend attacks are relatively difficult to pull off for a local purchaser of a good/food.  There are also wallets and mechanisms in Bitcoin point of sale solutions that estimate how much of the network is seeing a particular transaction.
Other than that... what sort of problems would you anticipate a long-solve block creating?

Insightful post.  I would say that perhaps our support of Sean's Outpost came about because it is small... and Bitcoin is (relatively) small.  We were able to see a tangible difference in people's lives because of what Jason was able to do with the communities generosity.
Of course, there are many "wide reach" philanthropy opportunities.  I believe in Bitcoin because it not only has the ability to help on a micro/individual level, but it has the potential to help all of mankind on a macro/global level.
Sean's Outpost is a real example of the micro/individual level and it is a beauty to behold.
I have been to Sean's Outpost.  I have been to Satoshi Forest.  I have seen first-hand the hard work and subsequent reward that Jason and his family and friends have turned their lives into.  It is humbling.

Shit happens sometimes.  It's called variance.  There have been some whoppers on record, time-wise.
EDIT: And the complexity/length of the transactions in a certain block does not affect the difficulty of solving that block.  The difficulty, which relates to how hard the block is to solve, is related to a broader look at the solving power of the network over a span of 11-14 days (usually).

Yes... but I suspect it is more related to them operating a fractional reserve that had as many as a million coins less than they were supposed to.  Lack of supply causes prices to go up, actual Bitcoins became scarce on the exchange as people withdrew.  I sometimes wonder if the entire 2013 rise was due to Gox's missing coins.

Agreed... bitfloor allows deposits at banks, which then allows you to buy bitcoin on their exchange.  Another option would be to open an account with Dwolla and transfer from a bank to MtGox, where you can buy bitcoins.  Or make a deposit at 700,000 locations to BitInstant... and again buy bitcoins on MtGox.
Bitfloor is the cheapest... Dwolla is the longest, timewise... BitInstant has the most deposit locations.

It is best to go slowly... Read as much as you can.  I spent many nights reading all I could find about it.  You can download the main bitcoin client for free.  This will give you a bitcoin wallet/address that is yours.  You can encrypt this wallet with a password in the client... So that even if someone had access to your computer, your wallet is only yours.  It takes overnight to have the client download the blockchain.  The blockchain is kept on ever client and is a record of every transaction that has ever been validated by the entire network.  There are several ways to buy bitcoins that will be sent to your wallet.  I have used dwolla, then bought the bitcoins on an exchange like mtgox.com.  You can ceate accounts on these websites for free.
For greater security, I keep my wallet in an encrypted Truecrypt file and run my client on the Tor network... But those are advanced topics.
For reference: bitcoin.org, en.bitcoin.it, weusecoins.com are legit 'offical' bitcoin information hubs.  The subject, implementation, theory, and outlook are all revolutionary to me.
Good luck... Feel free to ask questions.

I like your idea of waiting until after the holiday ad rush.  And your question about whether to advertise this subreddit, or weusecoins.com is a good question.  Advertising the subreddit is good for getting people 'here' and seeing the range of things going on with bitcoin.  Advertising the weusecoins.com address would be good for people needing some general Bitcoin education.  Maybe both?  And I hope people continue to donate.  Or we do this monthly or quarterly, or something.  The large number of people on reddit could help greatly with Bitcoin's exposure.

I also can vouch for November success.  I wasn't crazy about one aspect of using them:  You send them cash and they buy at "market price".  You don't get to set a specific price 'order' like on MtGox or Bitfloor.  When I bought, I would set a max price and always felt like I paid above market price.  Nothing verifies that what they paid for the Bitcoin is what was passed onto you.  Even if the price of Bitcoin was falling, I always seemed to be paying a premium price.  That and the 5% fee caused me to not use them again.
@_date: 2012-08-26 18:18:33

sgornick always has the good advice.  Also, if you go the paper wallet route... you will end up with a private key printed on paper.  This would allow her to import the private key into Gox where the value would be swept into your account.  She could cash-out from there.  Handrwitten instructions on what gox is, how to login, and what to do could be written on the paper.

Good article... but, Bitcoin is already to the point where backing it with gold is meaningless.  It has value.  It has usefullness.  It has unique properties, which are valuable.  The alternatives don't have developers like Gavin and Luke, jr and all the rest of the developers.  Don't have companies like Gox and bitinsant and bitpay blazing trails.  Don't have Theymos and Roger Ver and Erik Vorhees and Charlie Shrem.  Bitcoin is the train.  Get on, or watch it fly by.

Wow at this.  Imagine the first major financial institution that figures out that they can transfer value internationally, instantly, with almost zero fee.  Saving $25 to $100 per transaction.  I realize that they would have to have infrasturcture setup to convert the 'value' to Bitcoin, then the Bitcoin back to 'value' after the transfer.  I am sure there are flaws in my logic that someone will surely point out, but it seems like someone could make a killing.  Imagine how much international trade happens between countries.  Imagine the fees associated with these value transfers.  Imagine someone offering that service at an order of magnitude cheaper.  And likely faster and easier.   
@_date: 2012-12-08 03:38:00
I agree, completely, by the way.  And the things you mentioned are the type of things I find more intriguing/exciting.  I think I was just realizing how Bitcoin could also affect traditional international 'big bank' banking.  The kind/type I didn't think would touch Bitcoin with a 10 ft. pole.

Sometimes when you 'relaunch' the bitcoin-qt client (wallet), it takes a while to reconnect to other nodes and start downloading the blockchain, again.  It can sit there for a few minutes, looking like it is doing nothing, then start downloading again.  It really can take a day or two to get the entire blockchain... but, they are about to release version 0.8 with many improvements that shorten this time.

The number of blocks set to be solved every hour is not set.  The difficulty is what is set... which is 'targeted' to generate 6 block solves on hour for the next two weeks.  If the hash power triples during the middle of a two week period, the number of blocks solved will be massively affected.  This is not speculation or guessing, but how things with the Bitcoin protocol and implementation are designed, and work.

Text of article:
It is time to take the Bitcoin bubble seriously
By John Authers
The moment has come to take Bitcoin seriously. This month has seen notes on the online currency from mainstream foreign exchange analysts at Wall Street banks Citi and BofA Merrill Lynch. When Wall Street has to take bitcoin seriously, the online currency has arrived.
However, governments and central banks are also now taking bitcoin seriously. This week has also brought news that Baidu, the Chinese search engine, would no longer accept bitcoins as payment, after the People’s Bank of China ruled that Chinese banks should not process or insure bitcoin transactions.
So should investors also be taking bitcoins seriously? There are two levels to this question, as bitcoin aims to take at least two of the roles played by a currency; first as a store of value, and second as a means of exchange.
Its role as a store of value is encouraged by its founding computer algorithms, which guarantee continued scarcity. This gives it an appeal compared to “fiat” money, created for governments by central banks, where there is no limit on supply. 
But, unlike fiat money, nobody is legally required to accept it. As Brown Brothers Harriman’s forex analyst Marc Chandler points out, creating such money remains a monopoly of governments. They are not likely to give it up. 
Therefore its value rests on perception – what people think it is worth. The same is true of gold. But millennia of history demonstrate that humans perceive some intrinsic value in a shiny metal. Bitcoins have only been around since 2009.
BofA Merrill Lynch’s heroic assumptions suggest that at very best bitcoins might one day gain a reputation to equal that of silver, which is perceived as worth only a sixtieth of gold. That implies a total value of about $5bn – far below its recent implicit valuation of $13bn. 
However, as a means of exchange, bitcoin’s layers of cryptographic defences, the ability to pay instantly, and the security that comes with the ability to trace each transaction made with each coin, all offer intriguing advantages. 
So far, it is not widely accepted. But this year’s hubbub of excitement over the currency suggests that it could be. 
Merrill’s grand back-of-an-envelope estimate is that it might account for as much as 10 per cent of global online transactions, and of international worker remittances (which would again be a remarkable success). On that basis, bitcoins could fund annual transactions worth $9.5bn in today’s money.
It is easy to poke fun at such huge extrapolations, but hard to come up with anything better. In any case, the point of Merrill’s guesswork is that even if bitcoin is as successful as it is possible now to imagine, it looks overvalued at recent prices. It is in a bubble. 
But this does not prove that the concept has no future. Shares in Amazon.com were also in a bubble in the late 1990s, and yet proved a great long-term investment after the bubble burst. Wild swings in value are typical when new technologies arrive. 
Built-in scarcity
There is a further problem. Bitcoin, as Citi’s Stephen Englander points out, is replicable. The genius of the new currency is that it has built-in scarcity. But if the concept catches on as a means of payment, then demand will increase, and that scarcity will get in the way of its ability to function as a means of payment. 
It is not possible to conjure up a new precious metal to deal with this problem. But it is possible to conjure up new online currencies and that is already happening.
This could be an investment opportunity. Rather than an alternative to fiat currencies, bitcoin has a role in a critical trend; the disintermediation of banks. African tribesmen can now pay each other using their mobile phones, without involving a bank. Crowdsourcing systems raise loans over the internet without involving a bank. Internet currencies are part of the same trend.
Does bitcoin have first-mover advantage? Will other currencies be able to compete? Again, compare with Amazon. It used its first-mover advantage to become the dominant online retailer, as did Ebay in online auctions. Yet both contended with plenty of me-too rivals who were briefly valued very richly by the stock market. 
In internet search, first-mover advantage was no use to AltaVista, for a year or two as dominant as Google was to become. The same proved true for MySpace among social networks, or AOL among internet service providers.
It is too soon to bet that bitcoin will be the hegemonic online currency, but there is plenty of time to bet on its competitors.
Where does this leave us? Foreign exchange analysts agree, mostly off the record, that Bitcoin is not worthy of being treated as a real currency. 
Buying bitcoins while their price is so bubbly is nothing more than a gamble. Investing in other online currencies, or in companies that can help the bitcoin economy develop, looks like a sensible use of a venture capitalist’s money.

Strong correlation to Bitcoin:  In Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson, the goal of the protagonists in the book is to create a data haven and a cryptocurrency.  There are obvious similarities to Bitcoin, but also differences.  Minor spoiler alert:  The cryptocurrency is backed by a large stash of WWII gold.  
Weak correlation to Bitcoin:  In Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, the nation states have devolved into sovereign enclaves with the traditional government having limited power in only very specific districts.  The economy is based on Kong Bucks primarily because traditional currency has gone through hyperinflation, with trillion and quadrillion dollar bills being common.
Insane correlation to Bitcoin:  In The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, the world uses an anonymous cryptocurrency.  The nation states have failed due to their inability to control this currency.  The can't print money and they have trouble taxing the new currency.  A Common Economic Protocol assures peaceful economic activity between citizens worldwide.  Citizens... in the sense that they belong to phyles, which are similar to tribes.
I wrote those from memory, so anyone feel free to correct/expand.

You still have the opportunity to make things right, and fly straight.  Keep working at that job.  If you have to confess to your mom that you made a mistake (or a few), then at least be on your way to making things right... starting now.  The lessons you are learning are more valuable than the problems/lossed.  Keep your chin up.  Have a good day tomorrow.  Then, try to have another.  Then try to stack them, one on top of the other.

Indeed, I think deflation would occur.  With your original Bitcoin gaining in value.
If inflation is: *In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.  When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services*
We start dividing the currency, the opposite will happen for your original Bitcoin, in our example.  Worth more than 1 loaf of bread.  Disclosure: I am a little high.

Let a couple cities declare bankruptcy.

Let a couple currencies devalue and/or hyper-inflate.
Let a few economies drown themselves in debt.

This is why I don't mind some of the more legitimate businesses jumping in.  Even the ones that sacrifice anonymity.  If the CoinLab thing happens, and Silicon Valley Bank is their partner, my opinion is that it adds validity.  Or at least a yin to somewhere like SR's yang.

If you receive a tip from someone on here, and accept it, the tipping bot automatically creates a wallet here on reddit for you. Complete with a bitcoin address. You can send the coins to any wallet you own, or send coins to the reddit based wallet. You can also have it supply you with a blockchain.info wallet with your tippingbot address. It is pretty crazy.

Yes, and yes.  The wallet.dat contains the keypairs (private and public) for addresses of the coins you own.  That is all you need to be able to recreate your bitcoin environment.  If you have enabled encryption, they are encrypted, and you will need the passphrase in the new setup, just as in the old.

Weird statement, huh.  What I was trying to say, is... if you have one whole Bitcoin now, the possibility that the Bitcoin system is one day divided (to create more currency for use), would not change the comparative value of full bitcoin you owned.  If you owned a Bitcoin and they decided to divide the currency so there were ten times as many, you would then have ten bitcoins.  It would be a decimal shift.  From 21 million possible, to 210 million possible.  Or more.  Pardon my "I don't do words good".

Just because an address does not appear in the blockchain, and hence *blockchain.info*, does not mean that someone has not already created a keypair (public and private) and an address.   Nor does it mean they couldn't create them at any time after.
The blockchain only knows about address that have received inputs.
I agree that it was smart to check... but not much faith should be placed in this method.
There is no way for you to tell whether an address is being watched, by anyone.
Standard dictionary words, phrases, lyrics, etc should not be used for brain wallets.  Changing letters, intentional typos, using special characters, etc is recommended.

Realizing there are 9,200 people waiting to get verified on Gox, and they are clearing 1,000 people a day, out of the queue, is remarkable.  My freaking parents bought Bitcoin... and I am a 44 year-old man.  Wait until a really large merchant accepts it.  Or the porn or gambling markets actually embrace it, instead of dip their toe into it.  Or a Bitcoin debit card actually comes out, so that it can be used for anything.  Or there really are Bitcoin ATMs on every corner.  Or really can buy food and gas with it, at most/all locations.  When average people will actually choose to store "money" in Bitcoin instead of fiat.  Sorry, I have digressed.

No.  You only need to backup your wallet if 100 new addresses have been created.  Every wallet has the keys and addresses to every key you own, or address you have used.  All wallets ALSO have 100 unused addresses in a pool.  So if you had a wallet backed up from six months ago, but only 80 new addresses had been generated (like for receiving payments), the six month old backup would still be golden.
If you imported it, or loaded it, the backed up wallet would sync to the blockchain and ALL of your transactions would be there.

People place ask orders on Mt Gox at certain dollar values.  I think it creates a perceived pressure that keeps the current trade value below it.  And it is psychological.  And not even real.

I agree.  I think the amount of black market will stay the same, untaxed.  Cash transactions between individuals or organizations.  Even a certain amount of money laundering.  Does Bitcoin make those things easier?  Perhaps.  But it's not like those things aren't happening now, without Bitcoin.

Big fan of BitInstant here.  However, As a fellow Verizon customer....  you stated that it works with contract plans.  Was this person, above,  supposed to look at the AT&amp;T offerings to deduce what Verizon selection to make?  Of course not.  Also, you didn't answer my clear question above about contract plans on Verizon.  It went unanswered, even though it was a reply to your comment.  Seems like your answer should have been that it works on 'some' contract plans.  That said, keep up the good work and all of the positive, amazing things you guys do for Bitcoin.

A Bitcoin user is unaffected by FinCEN.  It says so clearly.
For miners...
For individuals, as long as you are doing less than $1,000 a day, and only dealing with your own finances, you are fine.
Regarding having to be considered a MSB, due to being a "money transmitter" according the new regulation, if you sell mined coin for USD:
Money Services Business - The term "money services business" includes any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:
•Currency dealer or exchanger.
•Check casher.
•Issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value.
•Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value.
•Money transmitter.
•U.S. Postal Service.
An activity threshold of greater than $1,000 per person per day in one or more transactions applies to the definitions of: currency dealer or exchanger; check casher; issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value; and seller or redeemer of travelers' checks, money orders or stored value. The threshold applies separately to each activity -- if the threshold is not met for the specific activity, the person engaged in that activity is not an MSB on the basis of that activity.
If you are a money transmitter, there is a ruling by FinCEN that states: "To the extent that you are exchanging and transporting your own money on behalf of yourself, you are not doing business as a money transmitter or a currency dealer or exchanger for purposes of the BSA, and thus, are not required to register with FinCEN as an MSB."

The encryption process empties out the queue of 100 addresses and keys in your key pool (where new addresses come from).   It creates brand new encrypted versions.  Your backups have the old keypool, still.
These are where new addresses that are needed for your wallet come from.  Immediately, the old wallet and the new encrypted one have an entirely different pool to pull from.  Any new activity that you engage in will not be reflected in your backed up wallet.
Yes, the old wallet will load and show a correct balance.  As soon as you start doing things, that will begin to change.  Destroy old backups, after making a new one.

Not sure why that would happen... but you can run the client with -rescan command-line option and it will rescan through the blockchain looking for addresses owned in the wallet, and update totals shown in the client.  This is not a speedy solution.

The router in the Avalon is setup to DHCP automatically.  The wiki says to set your IP to 192.168.0.101, but it is not necessary.  
Have you opened the cover and checked all connections?  Often the USB that powers the TPLink will become unplugged?  Is there a blue light on your TPLink?  You can see it faintly through the fan opening. 
Assuming you have checked the above, and if your wifi is turned off on your computer... and you have etherneted directly to the Avalon, and typed 192.168.0.100 into your browser... and nothing happens, something is definitely wrong.  If this is the case, I would go to the  IRC.  Lots of experienced Avalon users are there, and are often helpful.

What up drcross.  Need your opinion here.  My interpretation is that you can't compare the Bitcoin searches vs. the Paypal searches.

I respectfully disagree.  These searches often lead the price, not lag it.  We historically see the interest happen, then the price rises two weeks later, then more interest happens, then price rises two weeks later.  Which step in the two step cycle begins the cycle?  Not possible to know.

@_date: 2013-05-22 22:59:04
That backup is good, until you do 100 transactions.  After that point, you should create a new backup.
The reason is complicated, but involves the qt client keeping a pool of 100 unused address/key pairs in a queue.  After 100 transactions, the queue will start using addresses that are NOT in the backup.  If you were to install that backup, it would not know the most recent additions to your wallet.dat file, and therefore not be able to use addresses from the most recent transactions.

Ponzi scheme?  Anyone who has bitcoins, now, either 1) paid good money for them, directly, or 2) spent a lot of money on hardware and electricity to mine them.  No money goes to them unless you buy their bitcoins, which are then owned by you.  They hold value and can be used for goods, services or cashed out as money.  
A classic Ponz definition would be "an investment swindle in which some early investors are paid off with money put up by later ones in order to encourage more and bigger risks."  There is not bigger risk for the later adopters, just more stability and value.
It can be used to purchase things internationally, and locally.  Settle international debts, or local ones.  Out from under any central authority.

His lack of anonymity argument is off.  He admits that the study he references has the caveat that the person published their address.  Published addresses are not anonymous.  A Tor connected client that has never seen the network naked, and can't be traced to an IP, is.
His assumptions for the size of the blockchain are outmoded and stale.
Pruning to limit the block size by ignoring unnecessary data.  (Only saving unspent outputs) 
Bloom filtering so data can be quickly analyzed to see if it is a member of a set.  Methods for non-conforming data not to be passed on iun the blockchain.
Light clients so that you don't have to own/download the entire blockchain.
The idea that you have to support the entire network to be a user of Bitcoin is fallacy.

Right on.  And there are ASIC manufacturers who specifically have stated that one of the reasons that they got into ASICs was so that there would not be a monopoly.  (Avalon).  If one of the evil entities you were asking about (Wall Street, Banks) had decided to make a bunch of ASICs from scratch and unleash them... we would be wondering why the network suddenly went from 20 Terahashes to 60 Terahashes.  That would be a dark day.  There are arguments for how this could be dealt with, but still.  This fairly organic growth is a blessing, in that regard.

Ah, my favorite author.  But the Neal Stephenson books that really talk about things like Bitcoin are *The Diamond Age* and *Cryptonomicon*.  
In *Cryptonomicon* the main characters are trying to launch a cryptocurrency.  Specifically, they are creating a data haven and backing up the cryptocurrency with a large pile of WWII gold.
However, *The Diamon Age*,is the one that made my brain explode when I heard about Bitcoin.  It is set in a near-future where a cryptocurrency (and open-sourced matter printers, similar to 3D printers) have altered the world landscape.  When people switched to the cryptocurrency, nation states changed.  He even discussed the diminshed power of the nation-states to create currency, collect taxes and reign with a monetary fist, leading to their collapse.

That's the truth.  What people believe though, is that their old backups are still good.  They aren't.  As soon as you generate an address (which happens on transactions), you have used an address from a pool that NONE of your backups have.  
People need to recognize this.

It may be safest to keep some in a few different places.  Coinbase has strong security, but it is also a good idea to be "in control" of your coins.  If coinbase disappeared (unlikely) or was shut down, where would your coins be...
A wallet that is in a client on your computer can be backed up, and encrypted within the client.  This is generally considered the safest route.  Again though, if someone got hold of your files and had a keylogger on your machine, they could get to your coins.
People use an offline method called paper wallets, where the addresses and keys only exist on a piece of paper.  This can be stored in a safe or safe deposit box.

If you have had the coins for longer than a year... you pay long-term Capital Gains taxes (usually 15%).
If you have owned them less than a year, they are taxed as regular income.  Selling price minus the purchase price.
I paid mine April and May sales on June 15th when they were due.  You have to pay estimated taxes throughout the year, or there are penalties.
Taxes for June, July and August sales are due Sept 15th.

If you encrypt your wallet, it is useless to thieves... unless they get your passphrase.  It increases the security because an assailant would have to have the wallet.dat file AND your passphrase, stolen by a keylogger (most likely).
You have to enter the passphrase any time that any key-signing happens.  This occurs when you create a new receiving address or sign a message (to transfer coin ownership).
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:24:48
It creates an address for you, and a wallet.  You can either leave them there, or transfer them to another address that you have.  It is pretty 'neat' as fast as these things go.  People across reddit are learning about Bitcoin, due to it.
You do have to send a message to the tippingbot with 'accept' as the message within 21 days, or it returns the tip to me.  You can see above where I sent some 5 internets, which is good for a laugh.

If you are running bitcoin-qt, the standard client, then no.  Next time you launch your Bitcoin wallet, your wallet will load.  
The wallet creates a file that is called wallet.dat, that is very important.  It contains your private keys which give you access to your coins.  Back it up.  Do not delete it.

You can sign a message from a certain address in your wallet, and it verifies that it is owned by you.  It uses the private key to do the signing.  It is a way to prove that you own a certain address, or that someone you may interact with owns the address that they claim is theirs.

No.  Creating addresses does not delete the old ones.  This is a feature so that you can receive payments to individual addresses, all contained within the same wallet.  Here is the deal on the backup, though... Two things.  A) Why do you want to restore the backup?  Is your current client having issues/problems?  Otherwise, why restore?  B) If you have received 100 payments to your wallet, the old backed up wallet doesn't have the new addreses.  It is outlined in the bitcoin wiki.  
"So if you create a backup, do more than 100 things that cause a new key to be used, and then restore from the backup, some Bitcoins will be lost. Bitcoin has not deleted any keys (keys are never deleted) – it has created a new key that is not in your old backup and then sent Bitcoins to it."

Correct.  Or when purchasing, it works the same way, but opposite.  If you don't want the price to increase hugely, you spread your purchase out.  I believe the general concept is called 'dollar cost averaging'.

Real well done.  One small syntax difference is that you are importing a public address, not a public key, as a watch address in blockchain.info in step 4.  While it is true that every private key has a public key, the public address is a hash of the public key.  You don't have to enter the public key, just a public address.  Keeps your keys removed one step further from away from anyone else.

The idea tat your backup doesn't have newly generated addresses is specific to the newly encrypted wallet.  Regular backups of unencrypted wallets, and recent backups of encrypted wallets do not fall in this categoary, above.
Generally your backup has 100 new, unused addresses that are in the main wallet.  If you do 100 transactions, you need to make a new backup.  HOWEVER, if you take the action of encrypting your wallet, you need to make a new backup immediately.  The pool of 100 unused addresses is reset through the process of encrypting, so your older backup doesn't have the current pool from your current wallet.

Sounds like a great service... but I have a question.  On your FAQ you talk about verifying that a cash deposit was made: "At this point the seller will phone their own bank, speak with the employee who took the deposit, and verify that it was made in cash."
Do you mean to imply that for every sale, I would have to call my bank and speak with the teller that accepted the deposit?
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:59:03

@_date: 2013-09-26 23:13:46
Hmm... It seems to be a hidden fee, I think.  Normally Bitcoin transactions contain a tiny fee that gets paid to the miners for including the transaction in the block.  You can read about it here [LINK](
I think the blockchain wallet sets a default fee of 0.0005, which matches the amount of your underpay.  This is like six and a half cents.  Sucks that it bit you in the ass like that.  When people (including myself) say that Bitcoin is free to use... that is not entirely accurate, because of these fees.  They are necessary to keep someone from flooding the network with extremely small transactions.
Bummer.  +0.05 BTC verify

This has happened to me twice... when depositing directly from BTCGuild into Coinbase.  Two different guy's names.  My assumption is that a Coinbase account is used to distribute payouts from the pool.  That Coinbase account has someone's name attached to it.  When Coinbase does a transfer from one user to another, the name gets attached to the transfer.  Not sure if that is accurate or even makes sense.

If you have only done 20 things, the old backup should work.  When you have it make a "new address" it takes the address from a pool of 100.  The 100 that are in the old backup, even.  Your original wallet.  Each new address request takes one address out of that pool.  Like a queue.  If you did 100 things that made it make a new address, it would on  make a new address that was not part of the pool in the original wallet.

I just read your message and all these confusing answers.  What you want to make sure you do... is not "spend" the paper wallet.  What you want to do is "sweep" the private key into a wallet, or even an exchange.  The dreaded MtGox allows a sweep, as do a few others.  So do wallets.  If you use a sweep function, there is none of this business about change addresses that is not yours being used, or losing part of the BTC in the paper wallet.

I love you and there is a community of beings that loves life in all of its forms unconditionally. You are a life form. You are loved and you have the power to love life in this way. Love is a function of acceptance, and we, as humans, have the power to choose to accept anyone and anything to any degree. There is no limit to this and therefore there is no limit to the love you can give or recieve. This concept is the seed of family. This is the beginning of a Global Family. Each and evey person on this planet relating to one another as brothers and sisters and standing in and surrounded by the magnificence of humanity and the glory of life itself. This is the future that is being created for our race. It flys in the face of what is so and what is reasonable. There is war and there is hate. Today, to be human is to be separate and to be separate is to suffer. That is what we are choosing as a race. We say our actions are for good, but there is no true love on this earth. Until each and every is standing for each and every we all suffer. The future is wide open for us to create anything we want. Let us come together in love and harmony to experiance the power and freedom we have inside ourselves." [LINK](

When you send a certain number of bitcoins, the protocol doesn't just send that amount.  It sends a different amount and splits the payment to two addresses... then sends a remainder back to one of your addresses.  Makes it harder to track flow of bitcoins to prying eyes.

That fucking yellow line represents the goddamned buy requests.  The cunt blue line are asks... where people have orders to sell at a certain price.  Those motherfuckers are cumulative.  That is why they start pissant small at the middle and get big ass towards the edges.  That bitchass cocksucking green line is the price.  The current price is at the ass bottom, the history is shown stretching upwards.  The zooming changes the length of time shown in the choad-piss history of the price.

Well said.  And people also did things besides start businesses... People continued to invest/buy in.  And the development team led by Gavin continued improvements.  And miners still mined.  A bunch of people who understood the benefits and potential all just knuckled-down.  The same things happened throughout other troubles, not just the June '11 bubble.  Although there were hiccups when scams happened (and I could name them all), believers believed.  And the non-believers and naysayers went on their way.

It weakens the dollar.  It is one of the reasons that your dollar goes less far than it did very few years ago.  It makes money kept in savings accounts lose value.  It aids inflation.  It keeps interest rates down and the stock market propped up.  It angers countries around the world by making our exports cost more to them, helping us.  It encourages fiscal irresponsibility.  It bails out banks who shouldn't have made risky loans.  The same banks that have gone from being private institutions to being "too big to fail" and now "too big to jail".  And more.

Regarding having to be considered a MSB, due to being a "money transmitter" according the new regulation, if you sell mined coin for USD:
Money Services Business - The term "money services business" includes any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:
•Currency dealer or exchanger.
•Check casher.
•Issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value.
•Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value.
•Money transmitter.
•U.S. Postal Service.
An activity threshold of greater than $1,000 per person per day in one or more transactions applies to the definitions of: currency dealer or exchanger; check casher; issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value; and seller or redeemer of travelers' checks, money orders or stored value. The threshold applies separately to each activity -- if the threshold is not met for the specific activity, the person engaged in that activity is not an MSB on the basis of that activity.
If you are a money transmitter, there is a ruling by FinCEN that states: "To the extent that you are exchanging and transporting your own money on behalf of yourself, you are not doing business as a money transmitter or a currency dealer or exchanger for purposes of the BSA, and thus, are not required to register with FinCEN as an MSB."

Sometimes when private keys are imported, a "sweep" function occurs.  When this happens, a transaction is created and signed (using the imported private key that has just been imported), that sweeps the coins into an address in the wallet/account.
Guessing that if a transaction is created when OP imported the private key, Gox must work this way?  Not sure how the other wallets that allow importing do this.  
Assuming this is the case, it seems a fee should indeed be implemented.

If you receive a tip from someone on here, and accept it, the tipping bot automatically creates a wallet here on reddit for you. Complete with a bitcoin address. You can send the coins to any wallet you own, or send coins to the reddit based wallet. You can also have it supply you with a blockchain.info wallet with your tippingbot address. It is pretty crazy.

It creates a wallet here on reddit, for you, when you accept a tip, or ask the tipping bot to create one. It is not tied to another wallet, but you can send bitcoins to it, or withdraw them, or have it export the wallet for use as a blockchain.info wallet, that you control. I generally keep a very tiny amount in this wallet.

If you are using the reference client, thr private keys associated with your Bitcoin addresses are stored in a wallet.dat file that is created  by the client software.
If you lose the file, or delete it, or format over it, your Bitcoins are gone.  This is why it is a good idea to back up this file.  And to keep it encrypted.

Most companies don't hold the bitcoin.  Most companies don't even SEE the bitcoins.  They are converted to fiat before they are ever sent to the merchant.  This is how companies like bitpay and Walletbit (and others) provide their service to merchants.  They do allow the merchant to hang on to a percentage in BTC, only if they want to.

I think we may just have to agree to disagree.  I do see some of your points as valid, but have other opinions, as well.
1)  Helping our exports and reducing the trade deficit does help us, but hurts all of our trading partners, globally.  Every other nation can play this game, and many have started to (the Swiss and Japan).  Wouldn't inflation make it harder to pay down debts?  What happens to the loans we can't repay now, when they are rolled over into higher rate loans?
2)  Inflation is one of the goals of QE.  Lack of seeing any results of it is not a reason to continue it, but proves it is not working.  The employment numbers are skewed to make the situation look like it is improving, when it isn't.  The number of people who leave the job hunt, but are still in the workforce, are not included in the base unemplyment figure, but should be.
3) the only reason that short-term interest rates are low is because long-term rates are being held low, by QE.
4) high yield savings accounts would encourage saving.  A mindset completely opposite of spend spend spend.  You can't spend your way out of this... but only time will tell.  There are certainly people who think we can, and they set policy.
5) Inflation target of 2%... that is also Japan's goal.  And it appears to be working for them.  The yen has weakened against the dollar by 30% since September, when that policy was announced.  Last night the nikkei fell 7%, it's largest decline in 2 years.
I am not an expert, or even well-educated, in any of this.  Perhaps I am susceptible to histrionice... I just worry that the amount of debt that we are passing onto the next generation is unsustainable.  My feeling is that QE adds to that, even though it is designed to help fix the problem.

There are several options.  And easy one is to run the bitcoin client through the Tor proxy.  It is in the settings of the client.  Will disguise your IP address.  Have a wallet that has never seen the internet naked, as in, not while running through Tor.  It can then be an address in the blockchain, with coins assigned to it, but no one knows where that address originated from.  Also, request a new send-to address from your wallet for anytime you expect to receive a payment.  That is what it is there for.

Insightful piece.  And I can understand your argument.
People are offering you many opinions, here... so I will offer mine, also.
I think that the liquidity problem that you wrote about it real.  I, however, see it as a transient problem.  Even if the example 10,000 BTC owner wants to cash out... and it drives the price down radically, that specific issue, with that specific Bitcoin holder, is mitigated for the future.  Bitcoins are spread into the financial system.  Fiat cash is spread into the Bitcoin system.  There is a 'flattening' of the spikes... the outliers... the huge-holders... and the liquidity problem.  Will it be fast?  No.  Often ugly?  perhaps.  But I believe market-finding and price-finding are real things, and that this problem will find a way to work itself out.
I do agree that it is an excellent topic to consider and that your thoughts are well reasoned and well expressed.

I think what you are doing for Bitcoin is fantastic and path-setting.  I certainly am not interested in criticizing you.
The author seems to be into the more sensational aspects of the topic, their interviewees (real word?), and their quotes.  I suppose that is their job.
I agree that this is money with a conscience.  (blood diamonds, etc).  I think being prudent about "wreck government" type baiting may be wise, however.  But you are certainly entitled to believing what you do and in expressing it.
Today I am encouraged by the FinCEN saying at the World Bank forum that "Virtual currencies are not necessarily riskier than any other electronic payment system".  Which is a lot better than *omg we must crush this malfeasance*.

I think what lizard450 is saying... is that having 2fa located on the same device that you are logging in with, lessens its usefulness.  Yes, it is more convenient, but a benefit of 2fa is that even if one device (computer) is compromised, the odds of a second device (phone) also being compromised are low.

I agree with you that that is how it should happen.  I just read this week that some imports don't just import the keys into the wallet, but instead create a "sweep" transaction.  Let me go look for it.  Anyone else know?
EDIT:  from the bitcoin wiki: "There are various methods for copying the private key data from a paper wallet to other wallets. bitcoind supports an "importprivkey" RPC method for this purpose. Bitcoin-Qt's debug console can also be used in a similar way (see also how to import private keys v7+). BlockChain.info and Armory can also import them directly into wallets. Mt. Gox provides the ability to Add Funds using a private key: the exchange will then create a "sweep" transaction that spends any amount for that paper wallet address so that the amount is added to your account with them; it will also sweep to your account any bitcoins received to that address in the future as well."
Implies Gox creates a transaction.
EDIT2: from the private key page on the wiki: "In contrast BlockChain.info's My Wallet service and Bitcoin-QT each provide a facility to import a private key without creating a sweep transaction."
God damn if I don't learn something new about Bitcoin every day... after two years.

That is right... I think they say 4, and it was actually 2-3.  I have done about a dozen sellings.  To two different bank accounts, and it has gone exactly as they say, each time.  
It takes 24-48 hours to first be pending in your account, then about that much longer to be available.  Smooth.
