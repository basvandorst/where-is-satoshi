Don’t forget about the original “bitcoin atm spotted” post

I love how much detail this video goes into the symbol, and how much can be connected to bitcoin. For example the symbol can also represent an 8, for 8 decimal places to a bitcoin. The symbol also has origins of being in designs of chains. Maybe connecting that to blockchain

You can generate a new address whenever you want. You don’t have to do that, you can always use the same address for every transaction if wanted to, but those can be seen. Most wallets will automatically make a new receiving address when you click a receive button

I love tZERO and found it a cheaper alternative to all the other 1 click buy bitcoin apps.

I had the same problem with coinbase. Registered with them before they were required to have kyc. After that point they gave me a $10,000 trading limit until I verified my info. One day I realized I had more money in my account than my remaining trading limit, and hand to wait until I was of age to send my coins out of the exchange. 
It’s a good way to force yourself to hodl as that usually benefits in the long term.

The supply/ market cap of bitcoin is around 180 billion. What would be 1 billionth if 180 billion?
(Hint divide 180 billion by 1 billion)

You need to mine your hard drive that the coins are on. I wouldn’t recommend a pickaxe, a hammer could do the job much better. Mining is the only way to get bitcoins.

I expect one day that nations will create their own side chains of bitcoin as a way to track payments and collect taxes easily. The off-chain infrastructure for bitcoin right now is kind of a joke, but will be necessary in the future.

Dude I got a little secret trend charts have followed 100% of the time. A green candle will always be followed by another green candle, or a red candle if a green candle doesn’t follow.

In the United States banks have a reserve requirement of around 15%, that number going lower for larger amounts that the bank holds. This means that customers can have $100,000 in a bank, but the bank only needs to hold $15,000. I believe the same can be true for stable coins. However, most keep a 1:1 ratio for PR, as well as to be safe because if they fuck up there’s no insurance there to help them unlike the banks.

You can get some altcoins through the coinbase earn program. Sell them for bitcoin

I’ve had the opposite problem before, right wing people have disliked it because they say it’s “communism”.

I’m not 100% sure on what you’re trying to say but I believe you are saying “platforms are not accepting bitcoin from hardware devices like trezor or nano. There is no way to distinguish bitcoin addresses which were made on a hardware wallet, or from any other wallet. This is how bitcoin is censorship resistant.
As for being hacked or cracked, a bitcoin private key is a long string of numbers near impossible to guess. You cannot send bitcoin out of an address without input of a private key. There are several ways private keys are protected. The only way a hacker could steal bitcoin from someone is by finding that private key. So the safest way to hold your crypto is by holding your own key and not trusting others with it. Hardware wallets like trezor or nano are the best and most secure ways of doing that.

Just bought a nice bulky hard drive to run a node. I’m scared about running a node due to hearing rumors that attackers can trace to my network and find my hot wallets stored on the pc.

Not matter what exchange you hold your funds on, it’s never your keys. However if you do decide you want to have funds on an exchange I’d stay with coinbase due to being more regulated and insured than any other exchange.

Bitcoin nodes are being run on 5 satellites which broadcast the bitcoin network to almost every point of live-able land on earth, free for anyone to catch and access the network without internet. There are also 15,000 other bitcoin nodes which store every transaction on the network, which are located all across the world in almost every country. So even in worse case global warming situation, bitcoin network will be find.

In this situation coinbase is being the broker trying to sell you coins for around the last traded price on order books. This little premium is set to account for volatility so they can be sure to fill your order. I would recommend looking at coinbase pro where you can place your own orders for a much lower fee. It might look more confusing than a one click buy/sell button but definitely worth it.

Inflation will only really start when dollar liquidity increases due to the selling of treasuries from bank’s balance sheets into cash. Banks will then lend all that out which is when inflated prices will hit the consumers. The fed is trying to prevent this from happening by providing liquidity to banks through the repo market so they won’t need to sell treasuries for cash.
