Oh my one friend is sooo salty. I'm in a coin chat and my one friend who never bought in ONLY chimes in t announce when bitcoin has went down significantly and never any other time. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:35:40
Ton of people on some alt subs hoping btc crashes and burns. Morons don't realize almost every major alt market uses bitcoin for trading. If btc burns to the ground alts are going right down with it.

Coinbase is well aware people want SegWit. They've mentioned it multiple times. This isn't going to speed anything along.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:21:50
But be sure he is 100% the actual person. Apparently a person pretending to be the dude who gave like 50btc Andreas made a post on here claiming he was looking for donations for a pool of a future donation he was gonna give. 2 people gilded him and he got hundreds of positive responses. Over 10 people donated some BTC to him as well. Wasn't until the real guy tweeted out it wasn't him that he was found out. Gotta be careful.

With the CME minimum being 5 BTC, do you think that this will cause major quakes in volatility? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:31:27
But whyd you give it in the first place then if you knew they'd just ignore it? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:00:36
God, how many people are going to spread this fake info on authy. If you have the multi device option turned off, even if someone takes over your SMS they CANNOT get into your authy account.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:05:30
The guy made total sense. He likes the block chain technology but is not so much of a fan of how it's implemented in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:57:28
I really hope that Coinbase wasn't just keeping this a "little secret" for the big investors and now that so many people know about it they'll start charging fees on GDAX too.

No but I'd like to enjoy some of my money while I still have my youth.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:51:11
Turn off the ability to add multiple devices and this isnt an issue. I do think it's stupid that authy keeps this on by default though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:12:13

There's a difference between cult-mentality and a malicious 3rd party purposely spreading overt negative information with the goal of making the price of bitcoin go down.

I know selling and trading is better on GDAX, but is there a lower buying fee there then on coinbase? If say, I were to use to my bank account on either?

Oh I won't actually put any of my own bitcoin in there. I'll just wait for thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin to be randomly sent to it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:29:18
This makes me see how much other coins are so directly tied to the price of btc. Especially bcc. When bitcoin  goes down bcc follows the exact same trend. When it goes up bcc goes up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:05:29
Honestly I can see us surpassing that within the next month or two. Hodl strong and you shall make your first gain.

A bitcoin will be worth roughly 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:36
Yes it's 2 steps forward, one step back, but the trend is upward still. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:35:23
He's most definitely doing this. He was just promoting this new ICO KWHCoin which he called his "brainchild". He made a few tweets about it when the ICO was in it's pre-sale. And then made no tweets about it since. Looking back doesn't look like he made any tweets about it before the pre-sale. He's pretty much just moved on to talking about new coins. You'd think he'd be a little more excited for his "brainchild". Or more likely this ICO paid him off.

It is. And it is a common misconception that it is less secure. As long as you turn off the "allow multi device" option after adding all your devices, even if someone were to take over your SMS, they would not be able to recover your Authy account.

Just started using gemini and wondering why more are using coinbase over it? Only reason I can guess is because it has a mobile app and people are lazy.

So many people in the main discussion sub can't grasp this simple logic. Things are going to dip. That's the way of this type of market. 2 steps forward, one step back. But the overall trend is still upward.

Lightning is great and will be a major game changer. But the issue right now is the volatility. This is exactly why steam dropped support for bitcoin. Hopefully one day, it will become stable again and it will be more welcoming for stores to use as a method of purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:05:47
Or if you have two devices like an Ipad and phone, set authy up on both THEN disable multi-device. Can use the other to restore your account. Also add pin or fingerprint protection to the app itself incase you get a piece of malware on your phone.

This would've been cool for a technical friend as a gift but 8 non technical family members? You've had to have known that they would not bother to look into spending it and you essentially threw $800 down the drain? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:02:34
First, add authy to any devices you want to use it on. Phone, ipad etc. Then on your phone (it's different if you're on android or iphone) go to the settings then, the devices tab on the right. Tap to turn off the "allow multi-device" option.

Aren't whales only in comparison to others? If 30000 people had 1 btc they'd be just another fish in the (rich) sea. They'd still be small in comparison to the overall, and wouldn't be able to effect the market with any one of their moves.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:26
I'd put authy on two devices. I have authy on my work phone and personal phone . Also need a finger print scan to get into the app. Then I turned off the ability to add new devices. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:08:09
According to the daily discussion page, bitcoin is "totally ded".

It's the total freedom that doesn't suck. That you don't have to go to work tomorrow if you don't want to. People like to work and make progress and innovation and that's why they go to work when they're that rich. But having the freedom and ability to walk away from that whenever you like is very nice. Compared to people who are miserable and hate work who are forced to go every day just so they can feed their family and keep a roof over their heads.

I personally setup authy on two of my devices. Then I turn multi device off. If I lose one I can recover from the other. I'm not 100% but I think there's another way besides doing that.

No offense man but maybe you should be working on yourself mentally so you don't *need* to be be rich to be happy, and to just be happy in your current state. And if you do become rich one day, that will just be a nice bonus. Not something that you need to live a happy life. Just my two cents.

Then you haven't been in the crypto space for a long time. Bitcoin has had many bear months in the past and has always come back stronger.
