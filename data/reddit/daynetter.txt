Update: tried to fill out Yubico’s support ticket...4 Times. Goes nowhere.
They should open a crypto exchange

As to the $18 key, I don’t think the Yubikey FIDO U2F works with my mobile phone. I needed something I could just “wipe” across my iPhone, which I believe the Neo claims it does via NFC. In fairness to Yubico, the Neo worked well plugged into the desk top &amp; other computers with a USB slot. But I needed it for my mobile, which is why I went with the Neo, &amp; not less expensive options.

Hey thanks for the response.
I included that same “iPhone support” link in my original post. I understood (with limited understanding I might add) the gist of that as being “yes, closed source Apple poses issues &amp; stonewalls, but the Neo still works. With an iPhone. Using NFC. So buy one if you have an iPhone. 
Only thing is, it doesn’t work with my iPhone. 
Their quote from that link was:
“..we finally have some good news for iPhone lovers: the YubiKey NEO will support OTP over NFC for applications that run on iOS11 and iPhone versions 7+”
My phone specs meet that criteria.
I got spun around a bit with the acronyms and such, but it sounded like I was good to go with the Neo on my iPhone unless I missed something, which I’m not ruling out..  hence my reddit post.
And yea, I’m no super fan of Apple, esp in light of there “slow phoning low battery” scam. Somebody needs to swing for that shit.
But I’m a huge fan of simplicity. I use tech to cut work times etc so I can get outside more, get my  Gaia on. I’m simply more nimble with my iPhone because of familiarity, &amp; navigating exchanges during market moves can be harrowing enough without muscle memory jamming up the buttons on an unfamiliar Android. Not impossible, but...
But you’re right, it looks like my only option. Thanks for the suggestion.
