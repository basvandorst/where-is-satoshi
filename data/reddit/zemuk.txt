Thank you for an informative reply! May I also ask you then why is the difference in price so big between lets say GDAX, coinmarketcap and Bitstamp? I get the idea of coinmarketcap, which is like an average. But atm GDAX shows me 14,1k, while Bitstamp 12,9k. Huge difference!
EDIT: I name prices in EUR, apologies if it's inconvenient

Hello peeps, Im the new guy. Bought in 2 days ago at 12.3k€ and so far, definitely enjoying the ride. I was waiting for the dip for ages, but did the "half now, half later" strategy which was lucky, as dip is still not coming, but I know it will come at some point, And my plan is to do what this subreddit mostly suggests haha - no panic, buy more and HODL. This is just the intrudoction, I got a question! So I was realising I have to buy asap, but I wasnt able to find a comfortable enough method of buying, Coinbase wasnt accepting my Passport, so I just transfered money to my close friend via a bank(oh, the irony) and asked him to buy it for myself on the Coinbase, where he was already registered. It went all successful, right now he sent all of it to my Breadwallet. So here are my questions: 
1. Approximately, how soon am I recieving Bitcoin? Im aware of hard times at Coinbase thus it being slow, but you know... Thats my first experience and I be nervous of some sort. 
2. Can you suggest to me, please, some other, more convenient if possible, ways of trading bitcoin? Im from Europe, still not even sure how does it matter? Are GDAX, Bitfinex good options?

Im not so clever about Bitcoin , but I do hold a bunch since 2017. I tried explaining that banks dont have any backup many times, but people normally react by saying that they are backed up by government. Arent they?

There is no single person in the world, who has a clear answer for this. Even if there was, do you really think he would have shared it?

What are you talking about? There is no real negative trend lately.

Redditor for a day, but ffs dude, you are the only one around who actually watched the video and deserves to have an opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:26:38
Always. Check. Facts. Video is older than your grandma.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:22:08
What the actual f?? Like... really? Post months, if not years old video(you can check, but I def saw that months ago) and write “BREAKING” in the title? Are we back to the kindergarden? I know this isnt the most serious place for bitcoin discussions, but this is like not serious at all.
For the record, Im russian.

Bought in at 13,5k €. Fuck my life, Im selling... All my possible holdings of fiat to buy more BTC, while its on sale.
True story though, as you understand from my buy-in price, Im kinda new here, gotta admit I got onto train to make a quick buck, so I can afford myself a car, but that dip aint scaring me at all, which made me realise, I actually believe in  bright future of BTC so much, that I will postpone my wish of a car for later. Cheers!

Did you even watch the thing? How is this particular video making you say what you are saying?
