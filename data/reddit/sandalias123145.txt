i so wish bitcoin becomes a major success in silicon valley and that they take all the moneys and bizniz and new york just rots, not because they dont support bitcoin but because i fucking hate bureocrats
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:02:07
gold is so much easier, you just keep it in your drawer, in jewley or as normal people in the bank.
Dont get me wrong, i like bitcoin, but it needs desperately to be dumbed down hardcore, im giving clases on how to use  it and what to do etc, what we consider the most basic of practices are pretty hard for normal people, and not even the dumb ones, it takes me several hours to explain everything.
This weekend i have a greek group, and im sure it will take me a long time.
 :D
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:13:22


wow! thanks man! i will tip it forward :D
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:54:42

@_date: 2015-07-08 13:52:58

infinite bitcoins to spam forevah
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:37:47
but there is the protocol handler no ?
this at least from a webpage work, i saw it in 
if you buy a tram ticket, at the end there is a link to pay, if you click it in the mobile Mycelium reacts, shouldnt this be possible when sharing to Whatsapp or other chat apps???
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:16:38
yes, the idea was to see which other things are widely used so i can learn new things :D
i for one, Pay my public transport system with bitcoin and Taxi in my city, besides this i can order food from any restaurant from the city pre-paying with bitcoin :) (you have to load your account first)
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:53:01
they are too dump to manage bitcoin as well 
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:46:21


it could check the fees needed in the last 2 blocks to choose the priority fee, i think its possible
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:32:16
not true, i transfer to different currencies all the time, and i even make money :D
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:57:19
hi! thanks for answering, i didnt know you were from Mycelium:
My mail was about changing the share address by text to a clickable link instead of a written version, so when sharing address from Mycelium Via Wassap or Telegram and the second person receives it remotely in their phone, they simply click it and send the money.
The second was, to be able to share it as a QR code as well, useful when sending over email which one can read in outlook and pay with the phone.
The Third was to be able to share a QR code into Mycelium, which would make it detect the code and prepare the transaction.

to pay for dating sites about fetishes without your wife finding out XD ?
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:51:39
i am a person with 2 countries, because i married a foreighner, i have assets in both.
Transferring my money from one country my  other costs me over 10% of what im sending, and it costs in percentage, not a fixed fee and i send too little, its billed in percentage.
with bitcoin even if it goes down, i pay just a few bucks... if i send little i pay cents, even if its right before a dump is not as big loss as its with traditional service.
the thing is, not all countries are like USA, some have terrible banking connections and its extremely expensive to send money around.
so yes, it helps, maybe to a niche, but it helps.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:52:07
its Bitcoin price despite the LTC pump, bitcoin is not going up because of the attack and in the ratio to LTC is going down heavily
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:40:18
Czech Republik and Kraken but they reject anything identified as cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:06:42
Sorry for not providing more details to the story i thought it was self explanatory: 
after few years since i tried to withdraw money into my bank account (Raiffeisen ) i initiated the withdrawal from the site, next day my banker calls me about a deposit if i was expecting it, i said in deed i was expecting it, after a couple more days she calls me back to tell me that the bank will not accept transfers from cryptocurrency sites and she will try to escalate and find a solution but for now it looks like it wont be possible.
Transfer was rejected and sent back to issuing company.
i hope this is enough
@_date: 2015-09-08 11:30:48
thanks man!
@_date: 2015-09-29 08:02:00
Patent system is USA is a piece of shit.
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:50:42
it looks like all Raiffeisen banks are rejecting the deposits :(.
The issuing company knew that they had problems in several countries with them, mine was not specified yet and i took the opportunity to confirm that in fact here its blocked as well.
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:30:12
faster than bitcoin ahahahaha
@_date: 2015-09-04 06:42:07
lets hope it stays down. :D
@_date: 2015-09-18 07:28:32
i understand why you are saying this, but keep in mind, they just had an 8.4 earthquake, that shit is massive and people are focused in taking the help where its needed more than learning on how to sign messages, the next few days after earthquake there is a lot of work needed from everyone who can help.
@_date: 2015-09-29 08:02:59
is creative commons a legal tool to challenge american patent ?
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:25:35


so basically the first confirmation is needed in order for you to be in power of your coins, i know you can queue the sending with mycelium but its executed after the first confirmation
@_date: 2015-09-18 06:23:15
can confirm its legit:
 click on the upper right link 
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:39:55
this is one of the best news lately, americans and europeans might not notice, but some people in some countries have to go through really hard hurdles loosing several % points trying to top up paypal, usually around 6%+, this is  crazy good news
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:36:59
but people are buying there is just nothing on sale xD anyway, its just something i see, i do the same with the exchange in my country i set expensive sell and they buy from me with premiums even higher than localbitcoins, and i buy instantly in finex or kraken.
up to everyone
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:22:50
Bitfinex.com uses multisig, check in the deposit page and you will see :D
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:25:55

@_date: 2015-11-17 16:31:01

@_date: 2015-11-23 07:25:41
it was a news probably payed by the bearwhale
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:37:59
Shorts (borrowing bitcoin) is not nearly that high to be a manipulation :), there are not enough bitcoins in the lending system to manipulate the price from 1000 to 250 :).
This is a crash, long term downtrend 
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:26:24
maybe its a philipine company aiming at philipine customers ?

@_date: 2015-10-28 12:24:03
incredibly 2014 was my most profitable year by far
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:24:28
not that way, the BTC you have there, you short in finex or another exchange, when the higher sell gets hit, close the short you will be able to keep the profit, but set the orders for example at 430 now, and just wait and see, sometimes it will be hit sometimes not
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:29:27
atually it kinda pumped, and wait untill the eur dump takes effect :D
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:55:13
finex is multisig addresses
@_date: 2015-10-22 09:15:19
