There are a couple bitcoin ATMs near me but they're in pretty sketchy neighborhoods and have a price hundreds of USD over market price. I took a look at that thread and didn't see any more information. What would be really helpful is if someone who has direct expertise with these brokers and exchanges would update the pinned post with their knowledge. At a minimum we should agree to have coinbase and poloniex taken off if they're truly that bad.

I'm wondering the same thing - I just want to buy some BTC quickly and transfer it to an exchange. I can't understand why Coinbase is such a bad option for this, nor has anyone else presented a compelling argument FOR a competing product.

This has all the makings of a bad luck brian meme.

Valid concerns and points - but say that you're not concerned about the privacy of your bitcoins and that you're only buying (with a card) to transfer to an exchange. All the stores that I see seem to revolve around withdraws and/or bank transfers.
I'm also having a hard time finding another solution, as many places either want a crazy amount of personal information (SSN, full name and contact details, Drivers license, utility bill, picture of me holding these things ...). I see A LOT of criticism against Coinbase but I don't see anyone recommending a viable alternative to buy bitcoins quickly and easily.

I think there is definitely some substance to the complaints - but they mostly seem to be regarding withdraws. There are a LOT of similar complaints on the reviews of the mobile app (at least in the iOS store). I am planning this to be a one-way trip for now, I just need some BTC to use for investment and have no concerns regarding if they are traceable and have absolutely no intention of leaving the coins in their wallet for a second more than I have to.

I see a lot of hate on coinbase here. What do you all recommend as an alternative?
