It was BK

I understand you believe that, but why?

Gold won debate 2-1.  But Bitcoin won for showing up on CNBC

How can we decide if this twitter storm is reliable source or theoretical conspiracy?

I love the description of technology incentive increasing over time.  This is self evident in our times

I accept Im wrong, but why?
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:15:08
There are many alternative coins, including BTU.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:07:08
Places that accept BTC.  The list is dated.

Is there a list of merchants that trade BTC for mundane supplies?
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:16:34
Certainly.  But wasn't AOL the digital standard for years, now its Facebook.  I don't believe in either.  What makes BTC the long term winner?

I would love to buy digital currency.  I have no clue what to buy.

Fair enough.  That Gold pyramid scheme has been occuring for thousands of years.  I doubt it will end in the next 100 years.  I really want to invest in BTC, but my question is... is the worth of a coin  more then what the other investors are willing to put in?  I have asked all my local shops in Miami, and no one knows what Im talking about.

im asking why its not a Pyramid, like ELI5
