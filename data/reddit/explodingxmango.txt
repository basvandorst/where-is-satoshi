True but no emojis will make me give up a stable jailbreak

The good old days were so simple compared to now, at least the process of jailbreaking is better, almost a one click solution. Cydia is on its way out for Sileo though so some complication currently.  
I personally Use DateInStatusBar, BetterFiveColumn Homescreen, Ventana, and Car-bridge, Just doesn't feel like the device is mine without them

The community is definitely thin compared to years before given the Official features, but the holdouts still put up a strong fight until they can get everything they need to enjoy the device

I personally use the Iphone 7+ as my daily driver but frequently use other devices such as the X and 8+ and the speed is comparable in my experience, as long as I keep to iOS 10 the performance is just as good as the day I bought it.  
also you can jailbreak on all phones up to the A12 chip last I checked, that may even be changed by now, the problem is more staying on an old firmware until a jailbreak comes out

Custom UI, Faster Phone, Longer battery life, Custom animation control, Generally better control overall.having direct root access is absolutely mandatory at times when tinkering.I personally keep it simple for stability and sanity purposes, but the options are far more than I could ever explain.  
Edit: I think I can even get new emojis manually but I personally don't use them so I don't put much thought to that.

Just the thing that says "redditor for 3 months" and "this is a better system vs banks" gave me a slightly bot post feeling

Something is very suspicious about this post
