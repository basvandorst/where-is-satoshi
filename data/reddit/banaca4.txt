What does this have to do with my post?

I was watching this series about prisons and I had the impression  that gangs will mistreat you etc. How was  your experience. Were you afraid of your life because you didn't  belong to a gang or anything would love to hear more

we are stuck in this kind of "I bought beer with bitcoin omg!" posts since 2011. This is going backwards and we should not be proud or happy for some miniscule adoption. It should be the standard right now not the rare exception.
 Stop these posts
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:59:31
So you agree that these kind of posts are idiotic. Good
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:47:45
More like a cumshot
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:58:06
Then why the posts? You totally don't get the argument right?
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:33:40
Is it true that you get analed in prison?
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:14:39
Please post proof and results from where you live and LN adoption especially

Re-read my post. That was exciting in 2011. We have less shops probably than 2013 and nobody uses them. If you feel good about it, in 2030 you could pay in 0.00001% of small shops worldwide. If you consider this a good growth rate I don't know what to say honestly
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:38:05
How does it fix it without LN?
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:03:30
Superstar mumbo jumbo. Predicts 1.5k to 9k with accuracy. Cannot understand tech and calls ethereum and monero scams.

That's the opposite of freedom. He teaches how a dictator keeps being a dictator. One of the most Stupid things one can do.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:45:33
Bitcoin should start focusing more  on the value proposition and less on the flaws of a debt system that is in place for centuries.
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:37:07
Yes transaction  fees would make so much sense and LN is around the corner....not
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:10:31
Your comment is irrelevant to my post
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:08:40
Is that I am not a programmer
. You know that someone oversees github commits and it would take a non programmer years to get up to speed with LN right? This post is a tiny contribution for me calling.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:49:38
of course we won't. that was a lifetime opportunity that drowned when people saw the fees. LN is broken too. Good luck with replacing gold is nobody uses it. MS and others just stopped accepting it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:52:26
that's the most naive view ever
@_date: 2019-10-06 08:06:50
reason 4: LN materializes so late that nobody cares anymore. Some funds use btc as a hedge in the next decade and then it's forgotten since it can't be used as money
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:54:52
it's either banks and big hubs run LN or block size goes up. No other utopian way. Realise this
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:38:51
I am very bullish don't get me wrong. But only fools get married to their bets. I believe in this technology but if people 15 years in do not want to use it either for store of value or hard money for whatever reason it will be time to let it go. Mindlessly hodling is dumb. Holding with a plan is good. I hold since years and will continue to do so without trading but at some point I will understand that it was a nice dream like communism. You can find leftists still pushing but what's the point.
It's also important that mindless hodling is bad because people believe adoption will come witjout doing anything, without LN etc just because people "will understand". People are stupid and didn't understand many novel ideas in the past.

obviously it bothers the SEC for approving ETFs. And are they wrong? In the middle of trade war?
@_date: 2019-10-06 14:54:02
first of all there is inflation in Bitcoin. Secondly if it's not used for anything else than storing value even I would say I prefer a gold etf (which is equally liquid and you don't have to store it). Thirdly It's creator did intend it to be used as money. Are you new here?
@_date: 2019-10-30 10:12:19
there is no cutting edge Bitcoin technology. The lead devs are very outspoken about conservatism. We would be happy if in 5 years LN is adopted. Sad but true
@_date: 2019-10-08 17:45:13
I disagree on that. Beating inflation with a huge variance means that no institution will hold it due to their risk profiles. If it has spectacular returns yes but people need to adopt it worldwide.for this to happen, countries need to start buying  it as a hedge etc.
@_date: 2019-10-18 04:18:00
who can tell from their heart that this is false
@_date: 2019-10-10 11:38:50
data to back it up?
@_date: 2019-10-19 08:28:16
"does it work"? in the title
@_date: 2019-10-08 17:15:59
but your premise is wrong. Bitcoin was never build for the institutions. If it needs them to use it as hedge then it's no good of an invention. The purpose was to be something for the people a new economic system or parallel. And that's my argument. If its not used by the people after 15 years then it's no good. So my plan is to keep another 5 years. Of course anyone has another number in mind.
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:29:15
I thought the majority of the sub thought paying for coffee with Bitcoin is not good and we are only doing store of value. I guess we go with the flavor of the meme of the day. 
Fees sometimes are super huge so what would you explain to the store owners? Unless they only integrate with LN which is not ready
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:00:54
How exactly can loans work with bitcoin with a fixed inflation?
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:11:30
Imagine how great it will for the unbaked. Genius. Invention. You need to be deep in the system to use it.
@_date: 2019-12-24 12:41:43
Lol yes especially calling people names makes your argument bigger. Listen the project will fail without LN. I am here much much before you. Now stfu and pay attention to warning signs and try to make constructive criticism. Bye kiddo
@_date: 2019-12-11 12:15:00
You misunderstood. In such disaster there will be no running bitcoin network in existence. Can the network work off grid so then you can prevent double spends etc?
@_date: 2019-12-11 08:52:19
Nuclear war probably. I hate it when people here pray for the collapse of the system so they can get rich. Imagine if the system collapses and the value of bitcoin is not super high
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:04:56
Why night? I would cry in front of my boss
@_date: 2019-12-09 08:02:31
Tell it to the LN guys
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:34:32
What are you talking about. Lending needs interest rate
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:01:59
Dude it's not a better bitcoin. It's different use case and tech. Unstuck your minds
@_date: 2019-12-24 11:13:01
You are wrong and they did make huge promises in 2017.
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:32:24
Ethereum can't be a scam by definition. Go lookup the dictionary. You don't like it and it's fine.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:41:25
Yes that's what I see also they deleted Twitter and Facebook. I lost money too
@_date: 2019-12-31 21:16:33
Lol seriously? Luke and his gang are proposing cuts to this day
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:08:48
Stop this narrative it's old and boring. focus on LN otherwise the project is doomed
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:43:18
OK describe what blockstream is
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:14:34
Is that why banks and governments put bonds on ethereum? You cant be a programmer yourself otherwise you would understand. Anyway this thread is for tone vays and he is a joke scammer.
P.s I will pay you 1 BTC. Publicly if you make a dapp clone of any of the popular dapps that run on ethereum now. After two months trying a light bulb will open up above your head.
You are welcoms
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:22:15
Go get a logic check up. I said nothing about what you are saying, you are completely out of mind. Bye
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:59:42
My criticism is that LN massively overshot deadlines and after years in the making it is still not easy to transfer 50$ of value in 100% of the cases. Imagine what a disaster is if newcomers try to use it
@_date: 2019-12-04 08:18:32
Without LN? Zero
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:24:48
Arpanet was functional. LN is finished in 2016 according to promises. Is it now?
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:18:45

Smart contracts have nothing to do with gold or whatever. What are you talking about? You are. Talking to some fictional character? I never said anything remotely like that. Only stupid oranges are a fraid of apples. Do you understand this sentence?

@_date: 2019-12-02 19:29:21
They are not the same thing. You are comparing football with ping pong. I don't think you an understand this you sound like a total mental block. Anyway stop writing irrelevant stuff.
@_date: 2019-12-09 12:54:34
Welcome to the dillema. If bitcoin is not currency then it doesn't have value. If it is, people have as you said an incentive not to spend it cause it's value will increase as adoption increases. Just buy some to be sure :)
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:47:51
There are 1btc in tot in the example. I borrow you 0.02 and you need to pay me back more than 0.02 otherwise there are is no reason to lend you. Where do you find more than that if we are only 2? Make the example with more people and more BTC and you will see its impossible
