In Korea are few serious players in crypto that know what they are doing. That is why it is so popular.  And that is only thing that happened, Koreans cherish crypto higher then anywhere on the world, that is why prices are highest and they have a lot of volume.  I am sure other places will follow.  South Korea is also top15 economy, so is sort of expected to not slack. But can you imagine such hypes happen in USA, China Germany or Japan. When that happens we will be able to say that Crypto went mainstream.

Same as Bitcoin node. Syncing on my comp is totally same. If you have HDD it wil take over night to sync Bitcoin and Monero node. If you have SSD it will take 4 hours.
Important to note is that you need to do this just once in a lifetime. This is not something that you need to do every day or even every month. Just once. If you use Monero rarely you just use remote node and you dont need any syncing. Just a wallet rescan.

2011 $0.3 +1566%
2012 $5    +160%
2013 $13  +5823%
2014 $770   -59%
2015 $316   +36%
2016 $430  +128%
2017 $980 +1352%

Because stock to flow ratio tells you how stable commodity is. So the higher stock to flow ratio commodity have, less is volatile.  Litecoin is 8 years old. So no one can expect it will be stable. We expect to be volatile and Litecoin is very volatile.  Gold that exist 10000 years is very stable because of high stock to flow ratio. Silver have way lower one and when there is hype its price move up and down way more then golds price.

In 1954, a company named Centralna skladišča (Central Warehouses) was founded with a founding contract. Javna skladišča changed its name to Blagovno Transportni Center Ljubljana (Ljubljana Goods and Transport Centre, BTC).

I definitely made a mistake. My mistake was not to use the same rule in both cases, but I used comma for one number and dot for other. 
But what you are saying is wrong. I learned in school to use comma after the number. And you can see the journalist in this newspaper that is second most read in country also used it.  You are welcome to search for more newspapers how they use comma and dot if you do not believe my explanation from my previous post.

In 3rd halving we have once more history then on second halving. So ATH will happen earlier. And it will not go over $200k, simply because every next halving emission inflation or if you want call it Stock to flow  have less impact on price.  I believe 5th halving will have really tiny one.

Problem with Bitcoin i found is not only when things go south, but also if you dont tell them to sell at ATH. Lets say you tell them to buy when BTC was $1000. Then it goes to $20k and then down to $10k. And then you are blamed why you did not tell them to sell when was $20k.

Early 2013 is part of the first cycle.  
First halving happened mid 2012. Bull run in 2013 (April and November) were resoult of it. So first cycle ended in November 2013. Second cycle ended in December 2017. We are now in third cycle.
You could also call pre June 2011 its own cycle. But I dont belive it deserve that, since most of it there was no price for Bitcoin. If we insist at it can be called cycle zero.

Infrastructure has to facilitate more value transfer if we want to get over last ATH. If it would not then we would never go over 20k anymore.

My main point was that OP here meant he talks about stable coins but Hayek dont talk about stable coins. Since stable coins are backed by USD so when they print USD then USD and with that also the stable coin lose value against Gold, Bitcoin or bread.

Yesterday they had maintenance and day before yesterday they had some problems with internal transferring something. you can find more on their twitter. 
I had not used their support much lately but in past was slow. Just take it easy.

You have not seen anything yet.  Bitcoin price cycle last about 4 years. Once that pass you will see something. 
It will take 2 more cycles to have serious impact on society.

Why should price matter?

Because it is decentralized and you hold your coins at all times.  If centralized exchange decides to stop working you will never see your coins that you have them deposited there.
