Massive mistake with the full stop instead of comma
@_date: 2014-12-24 01:25:23
Wow this is really good! I really like how he is trying to get at the point that bitcoin is so not just money. People always give me such weird looks when I say this
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:21:32
I am excited about bitcoins prospects too but money has been around for thousands of years. Bitcoin most definitely did not invent money.
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:14:14
What is your point then?
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:52:51
You sound like a professional troll 
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:41:26
Your making the bitcoin community sound crazy. Did you just recently find out about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:14:36
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:11:03
384 AUD

I've been tipping charities on twitter already but yeah I will spread the love 
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:15:16
He says that bitcoin is the first occurrence of money ever! I can't believe I'm even letting this make me angry, it's so ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:38:19
If there was no money before bitcoin then bitcoin wouldn't exist. I do think bitcoin is better. Currency probably isn't even its greatest use.
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:34:25
I agree with this but OP goes way over the top. You should check into a mental institution if you think that bitcoin is 


@_date: 2014-11-02 20:00:36
Hello, how do I bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:42:26
This is amazing 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:24:30
Bitcoin FTW!
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:16:51
I am going too. I just thought this community would like a chance to voice their opinion.
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:24:24
Very nice. There's been talk of this for quite some time now. Glad to see someone is actually making it happen. I wish you all the best.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:31:06
This list is really growing. Hope it keeps growing!
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:19:10
Wibble bibble 
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:46:20
Yay

My first of many tips on Facebook to come is done. This could really accelerate awareness among the general public.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:07:37
From the Changetip website you connect to your Facebook account. Then you simply add the recipient to the first box and the amount in the second box and click on preview. It will then show the preview and hit share in the top right hand corner to finalise it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:49:32
Bring one to Galway!
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:41:39
I had to create a new post too. I don't know how to tip in comments, sorry. If there isn't a way to do this yet I hope they add the feature soon.
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:15:34
He was giving a talk about mobile payments in my university. I asked him after why he talked about apple pay and Google wallet and not bitcoin. He then asked me to help him write it

I love whiskey and Bitcoin. I don't have much money though so maybe get some cheaper bottles too. I'm also from Ireland
@_date: 2015-04-24 10:39:27
Doesn't work in Europe. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:04:29
I wanna tip tip tip, all night long
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:45:02
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:52:54
How long do you think it will take before your initial release of this service? And will you be coming to Ireland also?
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:40:37
Whoop whoop

This sent chills down my back.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:35:10
Please make this work. You could use it for taxis too. I've been wanting this for over a year now
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:50:47
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:11:05
Nice one, thank you! I would still use circle though or coinbase since I can use my credit card, sorry.
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:38:09

@_date: 2015-03-08 20:00:52
I would use it mainly for paying for taxis and paying for takeaway with my friends.
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:48:04
Don't worry guys. Listen to Captain Hindsight!
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:18:29
Being able to actually hold your own money and use it so easily, cheaply and quickly. It makes life easier. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:10:27
Yeah, I guess that is better alright.
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:46:21
I have the same difficulty. My friends get mad at me when I mention it anymore.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:05:24
In my experience, people just don't realise that they have to accept it. Maybe an automatic acceptance system would be better? You could make a refund button instead of an accept button possibly.
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:23:45
Yeah buddy! What kind of person do you tip most? What percentage of your tips have been refunded , roughly?
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:14:21
Me 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:50:54
I haven't heard of you before. Do you operate in Ireland? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:35:51
You're grand. Just sent you the invite there
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:14:12
Send me on your e-mail and I'll send you an invite
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:36:45
I have 5 invites left if people are still interested.
