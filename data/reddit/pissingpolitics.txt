Here here... my family recalled me discussing bitcoin back in 2012...now they all want to know how much I have.  Never tell anyone how much you have, even if it is not a lot.  Ppl get greedy and you will see horrible sides to their character. 
Enough.  That is how much I have.
But I will acquire more... HODL

Way to prey upon non-tech people.
Buy a cheapo ASIC doing 5gh/s, while a badx idea, is better than this.

Also, why does the tech community applaud this crap

I meant the hashrate is why I'd buy an ASIC.  I'd buy a space heater or a blanket if I was cold haha

Agreed. Did Reddit just get a win?

My frustration lies more in that they are selling a $1500 computer for $3200 because of their branding.  And any computer that is mini g in a small room becomes a passive heater, my office is a sweat box.
Mashable says bitcoin in their article.  I reached out to the company, they thanked me, and said Mashable was mistaken and will ask them to amend it.

Many EU, Central America, South America, and Asian countries are backing it up by saying they will develop infrastructure (atms..etc.) to support it.  So it is gaining government support.
