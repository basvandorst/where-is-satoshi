Any idea how much giga's private pool got up to in mid 2013? For some reason I was thinking we were around 20-30% of the network for a little bit?
Edit: was that mineb.tc? I cant remember the pool name now haha
Edit again: Yep it was mineb.tc. Had to look at some really old pool config files lol. I guess I just answered my own question now.

Why do you guys keep creating petitions and think it will do anything? It won't. Why not start voting with your money instead, which will do far more then a stupid petition. Avoid shopping anywhere that does not accept bitcoin. Overstock and TigerDirect are great choices instead of Amazon. There are also plenty of other choices available that accept bitcoin.

Mr. Rassah, I see that you have sold 0.01 BTC. This is bringing the price of bitcoin down. I demand that you show me all of your financial documents and tax forms for the past 5 years.

Nice, I haven't tested it lately since it has been running good on BTC Guild for the past 11ish months, but it would be nice to switch it to Eligius since all of my other miners are on that also. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to switch it over and see what happens again. I think before it was something with not being able to set min difficulty so I kept getting a ton of errors or something like that. I will try tomorrow and let you know what happens.

Anyone else have no fucking clue how much 1 bit equals? I know 1 bitcoin is roughly $370-380 USD at the moment, but 1 bit? No clue. And honestly, I really don't care to learn the value of 1 bit or how many bits 0.1623 Bitcoins equals. I hope companies allow us to chose, instead of forcing us to use one or the other.

Theres no way in hell a pi could run a node. Many VPS with 1gb ram + vswap can barely handle bitcoind. Even 2gb ram + vswap kind of sucks for the first time downloading the entire blockchain.
Boxes with only 1gb ram with no vswap, the out of memory killer is going to kill bitcoind. Box with 1gb ram:  bitcoind lasts about 20 seconds before OOM kills it every time.

That's just how to set up bitcoind and p2pool. What I am looking for is having 2 different bitcoind's running on 2 seperate IP addresses, and having p2pool connect to one, and if that one crashes, switch to the 2nd one as a failover. Not really sure how to do that though.
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:11:30
Right now the blockchain is increasing by about 1 or 2 gigs per month. Increasing the size too much will lead to less nodes coming up since it will be more expensive to host. I agree that it will need to be increased in the future, but is there anything that can be done to somehow compress the blockchain into a smaller file size?
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:02:47
Are they using bitstamp order book? Why not their own?
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:34:39
Exactly this. I do not calculate ROI based on USD when buying mining equipment. You have to base it on how much BTC you spent vs how much BTC it will generate. It would not make any sense to buy a machine for 35 BTC if you know it will only generate 2 BTC. If they delivered back in December, I would have most likely made that 35 BTC back.
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:10:03
How does one go about setting up a cluster? I am currently syncing my bitcoind and going to install p2pool after that, but would love to have a backup bitcoind going on a VPS that my p2pool can connect to just in case my first bitcoind freezes or crashes.

If a company ships your ASICs, they are not a scam. Whether or not the person buying ASICs did the math and realized they will never break even, that is a completely different story. There is currently no companies selling ASICs right now that will ever break even (especially with this ~13% difficulty increase coming up), yet people keep buying them.

Most likely because the people they asked had no clue what a digital currency like bitcoin is. If you explain the benefits (lower processing fee for merchants, so they can lower the cost of items), most people would be for that kind of thing. Ask them, "if you had a choice to buy an item for $100 using a credit card, or $96 worth of bitcoins, which would you go with?" If they still go with the credit card, well then... they are pretty bad with money.

It claims 1800 TH/s will earn 0.95598 BTC per day. This is incorrect.
Calculator: 
1800 TH/s will earn ~ 0.8691 BTC per day. Then you also have to factor in difficulty increases/decreases.
Total cost for 30 days ($504 per day x 30 days plus initial cost $14,400) is $29,520
Total received at current difficulty and current BTC price ~ $32,850. But by the time you can purchase this stuff, difficulty will probably increase and you will end up losing money.
Plus, you would be supporting BU...

Just curious, why does anyone even buy antminer S7's?


Speed:    4.86TH/S
Price:    1823 USD   ( 7.978 BTC )
4.86TH/s would make 0.04505 BTC per day at current difficulty. With a cost of 7.978 BTC, that would take ~177 days to get your BTC back. Including electricity your break even point is roughly around 265 days (depending on how much you pay per kw). Including rising difficulty you will probably never break even.
