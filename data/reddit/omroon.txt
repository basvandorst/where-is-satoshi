Brazilian here.
It is a bit of the economic moment aswell. Treasuries don't pay very much and the government/politics is shit enough to expect turmoil or even a partial default. Stock exchange seems a bit too high right now given the retarded government/politics we are watching currently.
So people are seeking alternatives.
Edit.: Treasuries pay quite well compared to other countries, but not compared to the risk it carries nor to the historical averages of Brazilian bonds.
Also - there is a insanely big libertarian movement here among young males. After 2008 it started growing and unlike the US and Europe it didn't slowed down that much.

THIS IS WREID.
I don't want to sound like a conspiracy freak, but the US government would never accept bitcoin if they knew what it mean. And assuming they know... there is something WREID going on here.

Did you ever gamble between 2009-2010? Not even with bitcoins?
If yes it's a very important thing to know where your bitcoins are.
