I hope you aren't serious. No offense dude, but investing isn't for everyone.

Thanks for that info, pretty interesting read. Now that the difficulty rate is higher it would be even less profitable than what they estimated.

What happened to the ANONYMOUS and UNTRACEABLE part of bitcoin?

Appreciate the link, I'll cross check my numbers with that calculator when it is back online. I used BitcoinX's [calculator](
I think I'll join in, take the risk, it will be a fun experiment anyways.

I know what a dremel is, but thanks anyways :) . I was just curious exactly what part of the MB I should dremel but fantasticsid covered that.

My drug business? &gt;.&gt; You are rather assumptious.
@_date: 2011-06-15 06:27:53
Is there any ETA on how long before the difficulty increases beyond 859426?

They are gone now :(

Does my ignorance really demand an ad hominem attack? I'm sorry for being misinformed, I was under the wrong impression of what bitcoin actually was.

Okay thanks! However could you explain or link to an article explaining the dremel method? My google skills have failed me. Do you simply just clip out the divider that splits up the pins into a larger section and a smaller section as well as remove the end? It seems like my pci x16 card is much longer than a 1x slot can handle.

Seriously? I've been researching anonymous ways to cash out and the more I look into it the more right you seem. It's kind of sad.

And good botnets have thousands of computers in them.

Damn, thanks for your response. I guess I'll do some more research into difficulty levels. I was planning on spending 891 dollars in the next couple of days to make 2 machines that use 2x 5770 so in total I'd be expecting 720 m/hash (180 per card). But if the difficulty is going to increase that rapidly I'm not so sure it is worth the investment.

You don't want it.  There are no benefits.

Seems profitable to buy in BTC and then sell on Amazon...

I've only used Bitcoins for 'storefront' transactions - i.e. computer hardware, gadgets, t-shirts, mining hardware, video games etc...

I used VirVox at first to get bitcoin - you don't need a second life account. You first buy SSL then transfer it to bitcoin and then take a cut when you send your coin to yoru wallet - so they'll take an decent cut. Now I use coinbase, much easier to use.

You can just give them a fake account name. That's what I did.
