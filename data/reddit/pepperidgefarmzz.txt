The amount of stupidity and lack of understanding of how markets work in your post is just astounding, then I remember I'm on r/bitcoin. Happy losing.

You can see them all, kiddo, why just settle for three? [Here's a chart](
of US price inflation deflation cycles over 300 years and several different monetary systems. Every spike followed by a drop is consistent with an economic crash, the larger the spike and drop the more brutal the crash. The two biggest crashes you see are due to independence and civil war, so they are a bit of an anomaly even for the volatile economic environment of those days. Between 1750 and 1900 every single major crash was as bad as the great depression going by the statistical evidence of deflation, that's a great depression level downturn every 25-30 years. You thought the housing crash of 2008 was bad, lol, yea it was bad compared to modern standards of price stability, a stability brought upon by Keynesian economics, but nothing like the rapid inflation deflation cycles of the fixed money systems of the past. The last 50 years have been the most calm and controlled sustained period of price stability.

Don't worry I'll take all your fiat off your hands. Enjoy the poor house.

You do realize that market crashes were much more brutal and often before fiat money came along.

Yea I will, can't wait for those treasury yields to come back. I'm going to be raking it in. With new jobs being created and tax cuts inflation is right around the corner, about time those yields came back.
