I care about humanity. I don't care about my holdings. It is what it is. If Bitcoin is the real deal, then it is. It's over with. GS won't stop it or corrupt it. Do you really think GS will be the end? It will only bring the masses in. No?

Dang. I see. I'm working on having blog formats as well. 
Thanks for letting me know.

Coinbase/GDAX is a good place to start. GDAX is Coinbase's exchange product. The experience that you will get with GDAX will be similar to that of a brokerage account for stocks. Coinbase is more retail. Super beginner. Like a bank account. Here is a GDAX playlist resource. It begins by reviewing the policies of Coinbase/GDAX and then moves to trading concepts. Link:

If GS were to buy CB, it would be colossal. No douche.

You worked for GS back in the day?

Okay. Yeah. I agree, and with ACH in the US, that 5 business days is standard.

The didn't provide a reason in the email?
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:29:47


That's right. So you have already configured it. 
You also need to provide identity verification.
Make sure you have that set up.
At this link: 
They say this: 
"Enable instant buy or use funds held in your Coinbase USD Wallet, your purchases will be instant, so you'll wait seconds instead of days to receive your digital currency." 
So make sure that you have enabled instant buy. Otherwise you will need to first transfer to your USD wallet and then make a purchase. Those purchases are instant.

Have a look at the user interface here:

That is one good thing about cryptos vs stocks; you can actually use low amounts like $10 to test with.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:19:58
You should select your USD wallet. Then choose your bank. Once the funds hit your account, you can buy. Takes 5-7 days.

You have to learn. Making profit ain't easy!

GDAX is a more sophisticated tool.  
There is a cost to knowing how to use GDAX effectively.  
Coinbase is simple and thus, warrants higher fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:45:39


Oh I see. Definitely noobs can't be concerned with that. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:14:50
Agree for experienced users. Super beginners will be okay.

maker vs. taker!  
Limit orders won't get you the whole way there.  
Didn't leave the "K" off by accident. :)  
Thanks for the warning though. Good looking out!

This is quickly becoming the standard per government regulations.
