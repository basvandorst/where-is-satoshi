Plugin client side handles the private keys and sign trade order.

P2P inter block chains exchanges is possible. Also there are collored coins that can be used to make atomic exchanges.
Ripple is also a solution.
@_date: 2013-03-16 00:06:57
My idea is a little radical. Don't need to mix blockchains.
Lets say I want to pay 100 LTC to you but I only have bitcoins. I only need to go to Bitcoin send dialog and fill it like a normal bitcoin transaction BUT the destination address IS a litecoin address.
Strange? Maybe... but it could be possible.
Some time ago I have read 
When a node creates an outgoing connection, it will immediately advertise its version. The remote node will respond with its version. No futher communication is possible until both peers have exchanged their version.
Field Size	 Description	 Data type	 Comments
*8	 services	 uint64_t	 bitfield of features to be enabled for this connection*
The field "services", IF I understood it correctly, this field could be used by nodes that offer additional services. So this node could make the transaction for a fee like:
Me -&gt; service_nodes -&gt; you.
p.s. it would be good if the service_node(s) do not need to be trusted by me or by you.

I'm not complaining because of a single 0.002 but about several fee level in a single day-trade. I think someone that moved fiat to buy btc (1st fee) then trade (2nd fee) and do it again (several fees) are loosing money. Liberty Reserve understood it. When we have real competition maybe it will be a reality.
Anyway this is an opportunity to someone to open an exchange providing a better fee structure to make it happen.

Once Litecoin hit $1 USD per coin media attention will come.
I wont be surprised if it happen soon.
Litecoin has all the properties to be the next disruptive success together with bitcoin.

Yes. They are. Where is your source? ;)
LR and OKpay share the same Money Maker niche. Okpay was already in business before bitcoin was created.

Bitcoin is an intriguing concept. It fights the established fiat system and also gives all the power to everyone to join force or to fight Bitcoin itself.
This is a power that never existed before.

Not me sorry. I don't see it as a necessity for me to be out of the market but a real opportunity for open minded people to offer a better service.
Most of the people are blind. Entrepreneurs are not. They just need a market necessity to make a killer service.

Electrum has servers but it still stands. Servers do not handle the private keys... They can't spend your coins. They could be used to handle the orderbook, etc.

Sure. This is the way to go.
@_date: 2013-03-13 03:46:17
Do you need it all? Sorry. LR default fee = 1%, **max fee $ 2.99**.
E.g. You transfer $100,000 usd with Liberty Reserve you pay **$2.99 usd** fee.
If you do the same to btc-e:
1 trade = $200 USD fee. Do you like it? This is 67 times more expensive than a Liberty Reserve transfer.

Maybe it seem more likely that Litecoin will go from $0.65 to $1.30 by the end of the month or that Bitcoin will go from $47 to $94?
Chances are that Litecoin will be the next crypto to hit $1 usd very soon.

Litecoin is ALL about Bitcoin. Bitcoiners that do not support Litecoin are just selfish people. It is like dads that do not support their children. Shame on you!

Yeah old. Anyway... Paypal is a dying model and Stop File Lockers is killing himself. Together they are doing a great service for Bitcoin.
