In short, no. The Chinese could exchange their bitcoin for Yuan still the entire time. This is what caused the initial price plunge when this was announced. When the Exchanges allow withdraws this shouldn't affect price is they are not exchange it for fiat, only moving the bitcoin. There may be a  *small* bit of Chinese that may move their bitcoin off the Exchanges and sell it elsewhere, such on LocalBitcoins, or trying to send it to another countries exchanges, but this would be low volume, and it is also what the Chinese / PBOC are looking to stop.

I'm up about $1800 in potential profit as well. I started in late December though and hodl'd through the great dip. Had I been able to sell at the time, and re-buy later, I would have more.

There is a $500 on daily ACH transfers.
You can run to your bank and wire in as much as you'd like instantly and be able to use it as soon as the transfer goes though. Most wire transfers complete fairly quickly within an hour or two.

Gemini went down to $1025. Back up to $1040. Thankfully due to the YUUGE drop in Chinese trade volume, this news didn't cause the drop or volatility that it would have back prior to the end of no-fee trading in China. This same news is what caused it to tank from $1150 to $850 in a day last time. This only goes to show the market is now MUCH more stable. The recovery as well from $1025 back to $1040 within a few hours also shows to prove that.

Every day is a lesson. Back during the initial run up in late January I made a purchase at $1150. The dip after allowed me to leverage and cost average to a $950 break even.

Except long ship times. Not necessarily their fault, just shipping issues.  I ordered a small Antminer R1. My order was placed 1/25/2017. It did not ship until 2/7/2017 which was fast, considering Chinese New Year and they said they were having slow shipping issues. However, I just received notification today 2/28/2017 that the item FINALLY has cleared customs and is shipping to me via UPS. So expect 1mo+ from order to ship at least.

True. I do not keep a balance on my full node. I use a hardware wallet.  
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:37:38
Two things
A) Exchange Security - Setup 2-Factor authorization with either Coinbase and/or Gemini. Both support the Authy app. Use a unique email account, and use a unique password. I happen to have made a new account on a domain i had been sitting on for years that I have no other accounts on as well. 
B) Assume exchanges aren't safe. Even if your account is secure, always assume the exchange itself can be broken into and coins stolen due to security flaws. Because of this, NEVER KEEP any balance you aren't willing to part with on the Exchange. I keep my bitcoin on a hardware wallet (A Ledger Nano S, Trezors are also good too) and only keep a small spending balance on Exchange accounts. I also have backup keys to my Ledger Nano S stored in a fire proof safe.

I use Zint Barcode Generator to generate QR codes directly myself.   
I used this to generate and print a QR for my my BIP39 24 word seed with 20% recovery rate. Printed onto a laser printer, two copies, one is laminated, the other is not, into a fire proof safe. Also have my electrum recovery key stored this way for my liquid wallet with a very low balance. 
When I scan any barcode, I scan with my phone, email myself the data (Using PGP), and put the data directly where it needs to go. I use a Proton Mail address for all bitcoin exchange accounts as well on a custom hosted domain, with the email account NEVER being used anywhere else, with a completely unique password. 
MITM attacks via Chrome extensions are a possibility. However I generally use Tor Browser to access exchanges and such, although not entirely the case as I do login from work from time to time. However I have MINIMAL extensions.

I panicked as well. :(. My hodl game was not strong, I'm as bad as the Chinese speculators that mucked this up. During the last dip I almost lost $800+. I'm MUCH more heavily invested now than then and would stand to lose a lot more if it dipped to the $750-$800 Jan crash levels. I sold just above my break even point during the initial dip 7AM EST. Realized the error of my ways, yesterday used my balance to re-purchased, be it it was at a higher point than my sell price, plus fees. My lack of hodl game cost me 165 mBTC :(. Lesson learned.  
Today, when I got addition fiat via paycheck, I bought just shy of another full coin to please the bitcoin gods and show them I have seen the error of my ways and bed forgiveness. Seems it worked. Almost immediately after we started the ride to the $1,000+ mark again.

I love Gemini. It took them just over day to verify me, with some back and forth with their support as I didn't have a utility bill in my name. 
Their instant deposits are great. Allows you to trade the amount you add before it clears, just not leave the exchange. Better than Coinbases' buy it and its a forced hodl process. I did this back in early Jan @ $1140 and watched the coin I couldn't touch tumble.

Gemini is usually good with their fees when I withdraw from them. Even this morning it only took about an hour.  However last night Shapeshift.io had fee issues.

I think OP is refering to the drop. It hit $1040+ yesterday, and most exchanges currently just dropped down to $1000 or so.  I think this is a good correction. So long as it stays in the $950-1,000 range i think we're fine.

Gemini - They have no limited if you use Wire transfers instead of ACH deposits. Way better rates than Coinbase. Coinbase = 1.49%, Gemini =  0.25%. On 1 BTC that's $15 vs $2.50 in fees. Likewise Coinbase also charges ~$5 above the going market price for buying, and ~$5 under market price for selling. (Unless you use GDAX which is a whole different story). 
@_date: 2017-02-12 06:50:41

Possible. Have to think bout exponential growth. If say Bitcoin added a steady growth of 1% value every day for 30 days, we'd be at $1,335. $1,800 for 60 days. $2,400 for 90 days. $5,800 for 180 days. 235 days it reaches $10,000. I believe $10,000 is a little far fetched, the market would have some corrections, but $5,000 may not be too out of the box.

@_date: 2017-02-16 20:01:54
It seems to have found a nice spot around $1040... almost back up to $1070-$1079 it was prior to China's bitcoin freeze! 
I noticed Btcchina, Huibi, and OKCoin all went up from around ¥6700 or so this morning, and are now ¥6750-¥6881. The fact that they went up as well makes me thing the China selloff has slowed and the ride's about to resume.. at least until the ETF on March 11th or when trading resumes when China unfreezes mid March as well and there might be another sell off. However if EFT is approved even that China-Unfreeze couldn't stop the roller coaster.

Gemini purchases can take a week to fully clear. You will typically see the money come out of your checking account withing 3-5 days, but take up to the 7th day to clear in Gemini. This is normal. They allow you to trade with it just they won't let it leave your Gemini account. Wait a few more days. 
When I first signed up I pumped $500/day (Their limit) into my account for many days. Each transaction took a week to clear one by one. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:43:41
I did as well. Nodded off around 1:15am EST, 2am EST dip/slip happened. Went down.. back up, down.. seems to want to settle around $1170-$1180 which is fine. 
The magic time always seems to be about 2AM EST. Not sure why as China it's 3pm about then, Europe it can be 6am-9am which makes sense but they don't have as big as an impact on pricing as China. Maybe it just senses I'm not awake.

Well, not under any type of FDIC insurance. The business itself could possibly be held liable, however, it's no guarentee users could get their coin or value of their coin back like the FDIC $100,000 Insurance that banks offer. That's why it's important to keep your coins off the exchanges, and use a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor. I have a Ledger Nano S. I wanted a Trezor but they're sold out everywhere until March at least. I needed to get my coin securely off exchanges before that.

I like Coinbase. I used them initially. I have no ZERO problems with them. Just their fee's are high, 1.49% vs Gemini 0.25%, and when you buy going through them, not their GDAX site, they charge you +$5 USD over market price, and -$5 USD when you sell. It's easy to use for beginners, but there are just better platforms with less fees.

Unfortunately most US sites and exchanges require this. If you need true anonymous access to bitcoin, localbitcoins may be for you.  However.. they usually charge more, in my area they are about USD $100/BTC more than the going trading rate, and can be as much as twice that at times.

I don't like the idea of a Bluetooth wallet just in its nature. NFC I'm fine with as it requires extremely close proximity, and I have a RFID blocking wallet. However Bluetooth has way to much potential to be exploited and someone gaining access to your wallet key. It also only has phone apps. I would need PC support. What I do love is the idea of a credit card sized waterproof hardware wallet. My Ledger Nano S on my keyring is a little cumbersome. Still looking forward to a full review...

Buy the dips, coins are on sale! As the market becomes more and more stable buying in the dips will make more sense.
As you see today, it went from $1070, down to $1010-$1020 because of China Bitcoin news. Back in early January this almost same news cost a $300+ drop, which took until just about now to recover. Today, the price has already recovered to $1061+ like the dip never happened. If you bought 1 BTC in the dip this morning you'd already be up $50. Cheap coins.

I actually still mine ZEC on CPU's. Got two 14 core Xeons in brand new Dell R730's. I always run at least a weekend of stress tests before they're put into production. I used to use Folding but I use nheqminer for CPU crunching. It gets 65Hash/S, where as a RX480 gets about 250Hash/S.  At current rates that's about $0.30c/day. Not worth the power, but good for a benchmark. ZEC is still GPU minable, I get about 0.5 ZEC/week with a CPU and GPU setup I have. After power, it's profitable.

When you get your Trezor or Ledger Nano S (I like both, Trezor was out of stock so I got a Nano) it will give you seed words. I used a 24 word seed for mine. You can use only 12, more letters, more secure, but also more of a pain to type. You have to reenter your recovery keys whenever a firmware update on the wallet is done. You write this down, DO NOT save it on a computer at all. This allows you to recover your seed to another hardware wallet in case yours is lost, or any BIP44 compatable wallet. (Currently Mycelium also supports it  ).
I wrote my 24 words in a Excel sheet (NOT SAVING IT, directly printing it) and printed two copies on a laser printer. I then typed my recovery keys in a local run program (not website) QR code generator with 20% recovery rate and printed two copies on a laser printer. Both are laser, not inkjet as laser will not smudge when wet, inkjet will. I laminated one copy of each the QR and real word list, and threw it in a locked drawer in my home office. The non laminated copies are in a fire proof basement safe in a separate location at a relatives house. NOTHING gets my coins. Not even a fire. Short of a large nuke vaporizing my region, I'm good. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:29:03
BIP39. It's a standard. 
There's a finite number of words that are in the dictionary to be used as your seed words. Translations are available for several languages as well. Word list is 2048 words. Using a 24 word seed there are 2048^24 possibilities. That's 29,642,774,844,752,946,028,434,172,162,224,104,410,437,116,074,403,984,394,101,141,506,025,761,187,823,616 possibilities. The idea behind the nano is the device wipes itself after 3 tries. It's secure. You would need physical access to the device to even try to do anything with it. 
You're more likely to have a real world attack then to have it guessed. Ex have someone force you to give them the pin. See KXCD for reference.     However, the latest v1.3 firmware released today allows you to create a alternate pin with alternate addresses and balances which is perfect for working under duress. Allow them access to something, but not your real balance. 
*EDIT* More like 2048^23 possibilities. Last word is a checksum.

There's a big disconnect right now of Chinese exchanges and US exchanges due to the withdrawl ban on the major Chinese exchanges, only allowing Yuan withdrawns to banking accounts, locking bitcoin in place. 
Right now, BTC China, Huobi, and OKCoin are all trading at ¥6744 average, with US Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Coinbase, and Gemini trading at average of $1011. 
According to Xe.com, ¥6744 is equal to $981 USD, trading a whole $30 USD equivalent less in China than the US average. If Chinese exchanges were allowing withdrawns, it would be worth buying as much BTC on a Chinese exchange, then sending to to a US exchange and selling it, so long as you purchased enough to negate both BTC transaction fees, and any exchange rate fees, which should be less than 1% of trading price or around $10/BTC. 
I wouldn't do it now, but if the trend continues once BTC sending/receiving is lifted in China, it's worth looking into. However I would CAREFULLY read up on whatever new "Restrictions" they add to "Prevent money laundering" to the Chinese exchanges when they reopen.

I can buy on Gemini for $1184 now where the only offer for now is going at $1272, only only 0.0650 BTC.  Likewise buying/selling with ClearXchange is limited to 1.00 BTC so I could not sell a good chunk of BTC there. Same with Postal Money Orders.

Gemini. 
Their fees are WAY lower. Coinbase charges 1.49%, Gemini does 0.25%. Also Gemini's daily auction at 4pm EST is handy for getting some coin daily a few bucks under going price usually, although today it was a few cents over. 
It's not a bad idea to set up one at Gemini and another Exchange as well. That way you always have a backup. I have accounts at two exchanges just for suck a reason, but keep my coin on neither in a hardware wallet.

You will want to mint a ALT coin. Right now, the most efficient for me (I have a RX 480 and R9 290) is ZCASH. I use Claymore's ZCASH miner which is hands down the best AMD based ZCASH miner performance wise.    Just get a ZCASH wallet, mine to that, then convert it to BTC. I currently generate about 640 Sol/S on a i7 6700K, R9 290, RX 480 on my system making a good amount of ZEC. I use Shapeshift.io to transfer it to my Exchange's BTC wallet, and next time I purchase BTC from the exchange send it in with the lump sum  (To keep the number of private keys down to make fees cheaper later on).

If you already removed all Bitcoin and Alt coins from that ledger nano, simply factory reset it. It will generate a new backup code and new private key for you. Easy as that. Just don't reset it until you're sure you removed all coin from all your accounts you had on it.

Well, it's not that further off. When I place a Amazon order, it takes 1-3 hours sometimes to process before it gets to packing. Same with many other online retailers. If you sent with a good enough fee 1-3 hours for a few confirmations isn't bad. Lightnight will help with this.. or Sprite.

I was thinking the same thing. If we have no news within a week or about from SEC, I think it may pass, given their history of allowing candidates to withdraw instead of giving out a flat out denial to them. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:58:29
The reason they do this is because your USD and fiat currency balance in Gemini is FDIC insured and backed by a bank they partner with based out of New York State. So essentially, you are opening a checking account like a bank, which I've had to provide a license for. (I required it at the bank to wire transfer money from my bank to Gemini as well). In my mind at least it solidifies my idea of them being a legitimate exchange that will not take your money and run. They also don't run credit checks on your like a bank or company does when you apply for a credit card, those in themselves provide identification that you are indeed a real person at that address.

@_date: 2017-02-25 03:55:50
...Yes you can.  I bought 2/3 of my bitcoin via Gemini and it's sitting in my Ledger Nano S now. When you buy it, it's placed on hold for about a week until the bank transaction clears. You can buy/sell bitcoin, either, usd with it, but you CANNOT let it's value leave your account until the transaction clears. (This is actually BETTER) than coinbase which completely locks it.. which happened to me when I bought at $1144 back in January on Coinbase and watched the market tank while I could do nothing. )  Once the transaction clears, you can send it wherever you want.

I think we hit a soft floor of $1100 now.  It got up to almost $1120, and keeps dropping down to just above $1100, then rises, drops. I think it's more Chinese or others dumping at the $1110 mark. It keeps rebounding.. nothing keeps Bitcoin down! Once the sellouts non hodl's sell, it'll go up again. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:14:06
I think all these exchanges halting withdrawls, forcing their account holders to sell in Yuan is causing all the price flotations. The price has gone between $950-$990 like 4 times in the past 24 hours since the initial dip from $1070. I think the holders in China are waiting till it gets to $990 levels in Yuan, then sell, price recovers, then more sell offs. Rinse, wash, repeat.

I'm thinking maybe for safety. Going on their main account, which has ties perhaps linking to other sites/email addresses, could potentially make them a target. Especially the "I just bought 10 BTC" guy. Even if you keep a hardware wallet, if you buy/sell you're using an exchange account.

Unfortunately more and more sites are not allowing credit card, and PayPal, payments and Bitcoin is seen as a threat to them and they do not allow bitcoin purchases.
Several Options:
Make an account on Coinbase (Easy, quick) and link your checking account within a few days via trial deposits. Their fees are higher at 1.49% + you pay about $5 more than the going price. Or you can use Gemini (Quick, requires ID verification, and a initial wire transfer to set up bank account ACH payments). Their fees are lower, 0.25%, and trade at market price. 
Another option, LocalBitcoins   Chances are there may be someone near you willing to sell a small amount. Maybe not $1.50, but some do $50 in person. You can also purchase online via that method via bank transfer and money orders. 
A third option: Mine it yourself! Mining bitcoin is too hard for home use, but you can check out forms and find out how to mine Ether, or mine Z-Cash, then use a site like shapeshift.io to convert it to bitcoin. I occasionally mine Z-Cash. I had dual RX 480's on my home PC and I can make about $3 running them 12 hours a day or so, less if you count the electricity cost. But if you have a fast system you could mine a few $1's worth in a few days. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:31:35
I did my initial application. I had feedback maybe..36 hours later? I had to upload additional documents.

I did not wire in until I was verified.

Perhaps influenced by both the ETF decision. Also, it's to note that Coinbase and GDAX were down at the time due to a Amazon AWS S3 outage. Coinbase pulled the plug on all services this afternoon until Amazon stabilized their services.  Perhaps volume shifted.

Three Things:
* 3 Major Chinese exchanges came out saying they're extending their ban on withdraw from their exchanges in BTC. This caused some panic in China. 
* 1 Chinese Exchange came out saying they're going to slowly allow withdraws. This might have triggered some selling of bitcoins that had been held up for 30 days. 
* Winkelvii Bitcoin ETF: People are getting nervous as we're a few days from the deadline. Potentially hours. Some investors are selling massive lots due to fear of a panic sell if the ETF does not pass. Their hodl game is weak.

There was some major selling on GDAX I see. It was at $1290 stable overnight, got as low as $1226, and immediately jumped back up to $1260 or so and is continuing to recover at $1271 now.  I was out at the grocery store when the dip happened around noon EST to $1226 :(. Couldn't buy. Should have bought the dip instead of food. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:34:18
No problem! Also their fees are MUCH lower. 
Coinbase charges 1.49%, Gemini charges 0.25%. 
Also, say if the going price of BTC is $1180. Coinbase will have their buy price at $1185, and their sell price if you're selling at $1175. Gemini will have the buy/sell price at market value $1180. You could be saving a good amount of money by switching to Gemini as well.

They can't. The max period is 3 years and it's already been extended and played out as long as it can.

Prices on GDAX/Coinbase and Gemini got down to $1188. There was almost no volume at least on Gemini. Then the hodlers woke up (6:40am EST) and started buying and added resisting and prices are back up $1230+ now. 
Thought this was SEC decision. Turns out it's just more China FUD, they released the exchanges hold and are now just implementing a "blacklist" of "bad" addresses where Exchanges are not allowed to send bitcoin. We knew this would happen days before the SEC decision.

@_date: 2017-03-07 16:14:18
Yea NEVER use Coinbase directly. If you do, use GDAX. Lower fees, but you have to already have USD transferred into GDAX/Coinbase to use. I use Gemini now since I can instant buy up to $500 a day and trade with it (buy and sell) until it clears, just can't leave my exchange. I got screwed during the great Dip from $1150 to $800 on Jan 4th on Coinbase. Watched my locked BTC devalue and I couldn't do anything about it. Gemini I could have saved some money so I could buy more coin later. Or if I had used GDAX.

The last few days every time I see it dump bellow $1170 I see TONS of buys pop up and it meets hard resistence and doesn't want to fall further than that. I'm thinking we'll be back to $1220-$1250 soon, with another sub $1200 dip before it settles. If the ETF decision happens, all bets are off and I see a hard floor of maybe $1050-$1100 if it fails, moon if it passes.
This is all based off my own observation and I have absolutely no fact or expertise to back it up.

It's just to close to the ETF decision for me. If ETF fails, price will dip a good amount then and be worth buying. If it is approved.. buying immediately after the decision is a good buy. Either way less risky buy time will be after next Monday for sure. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:27:57
China just unbanned bitcoin I believe according to some other posts. Probably a market reaction to it. On a real level, bitcoin are no longer being held hostage in Chinese exchanges so they are able to send it worldwide again, and perhaps some people who had been waiting to be sent BTC from a Chinese account got it and sold it.

Don't use Coinbase. Switch to Gemini.
Gemini you can do a wire transfer and transfer in as much fiat as you want a day, be it you pay a wire fee at your bank of $20-$30. They also allow $500/business day ACH payment deposits. The difference with Coinbase vs Gemini is Gemini when you initiate a transfer, you get the $500 in your account instantly. You can use it however you'd like. Buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, whatever you want. They will however place a hold on your account for that value, so it will not allow you to send that value of bitcoin (plus a little extra if you have more to account for price variance) out of your account. This was, you can buy coin, and not have to worry about losing it if price plummets as you still sell.

It seems like your transaction was big. However your Nano wallet did operate correctly.  Your Satoshi per KB was good at 120 Sat/KB or so. Your input transactions much have been large, ie in the ~6 BTC you sent in this transaction, you must have received it in many small incriminates, (example 60 0.1 BTC transcations, or 120 0.05BTC transactions). When you're sending them, it makes the transaction larger and harder to process so it costs more. 
Usually when I know I'll be receiving many small BTC increments, I will have them sent to my Exchange accounts deposit address, then send them to my Ledger Nano S as one transaction as the Exchanges pay the fee so I don't have to, and I have one transaction to pay for in the future vs 50 in transfer fees. 
Sometimes if I accumulate a large amount of small transactions, I will sent my entire balance to my own address and pay the fees now so I don't have to in the future and not have to worry about it. (I mine and convert ZEC to BTC on "free" electricity on occasion, so I make up for the fees that way).

Yes and no. It getting closer to the date doesn't mean it's got any more or less chance of being accepted, rejected, or pulled. The Winikelvi could withdraw their application at 11:59:59pm on March 10th if they wanted. 
The general thinking I see is that they have seen some meetings and documents filed in the last few days and think 'why would they file or revise things if they knew they were being denied'. They verywell could know they just need a few edits and be approved, or they could be desperately trying to amend their paperwork in order to desperately get approval and change the SEC's mind. We just don't have any information to indicate what's going on.

There is on earnings. Holding (hodling) there is none as right now it's perceived as an asset more or less that you just bought. But if you put $10k into bitcoin a half year ago and now have $20k of bitcoin due to price increase, and you sell it back to USD and transfer it to a bank account, you have to report the $10k earnings and pay taxes on it. If it remains in bitcoin.. and you spend it in bitcoin, you're fine.  Likewise banks if you transfer anything close to $10k into an account, even try to mask it by doing small transfers here and there, they are required to report it and you basically have to fill out tax forms. Granted, you may get around it, but if you ever get audited you would have to pay a fine.

The general thinking is that most clients who coins were held and locked in the exchanges would want to get out of bitcoin and would sell.

Was the 24 word seed word BIP39 compatible?
If so, you can use this tool (  or   Don't run it on the site, save it locally to your system first then open the html file). Put the seed words in and it will generate private keys for the addresses you used. (Note addresses may be off but they will be the correct key). Install Bitcoin Core and import the private key after letting Bitcoin Core do it's initial sync. (   )
(Note these are instructions I found for BIP39 recovery from 24 character seed words found on Leger Nano's found here  ). I used these to recover and fix a Z-Cash Ledger wallet that got corrupt.

When I used to use Coinbase, it would take anywhere from 4 to 8 days to clear, despite them saying less than 7 days. 
Use Gemini instead. You and wire in an unlimited amount of money that clears INSTANTLY, or you can do up to $500 daily ACH transfers. Each ACH transfer takes 4-7 days to clear, HOWEVER, unlike Coinbase it lets you buy/sell whatever you want with it while it clears. It just keeps a $500 (Or whatever amount you choose) hold on your account, so you have to have at least $500 USD, $500 of BTC, or $500 of ETH in your account, it will not let you transfer it to a bank or to another address until it fully clears.

Also, there's horror stories of people getting USB/BTC stuck sending from their Coinbase account to GDAX and unable to recover them and support not replying to them due to the fact their support is overwhelmed by the giant influx of users.

Simple: Don't have him convert it to cash. Have him send and spend it in Bitcoin. 
There's a story somewhere where real estate agents managed to help a bitcoiner use bitcoin to pay for a house. He only paid a fraction of what the bitcoin was worth at the time, so he was happy. After the buyer got the coin, the price went up even more, so they got more than they wanted for the house. Everything worked out. 
For large purchases I don't think it would be that hard to find buyers. And for small items purchased, like food, etc, he could easily sell a few thousand a week on something like LocalBitcoins for cash.

Well we didn't see any major drops this morning under $1,000. I think the lowest was $1,050 during some major sell? Wait and see. 
But it seems we're back to the $1200's. Maybe about to hit $1300 prior to ETF announcement.

I've been reading up on this. Although no action = auto approval, it has NEVER been done for an ETF in the past, and it's VERY unlikely. However we are in odd times, where there are many current vacant positions in the SEC that would be part of the approval process. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:59:35
The v1.2 &gt; v1.3 firmware update DOES NOT retain the seed key. You will need to have your seed on hand once you update to v1.3 to restore it.  *Note* for future updates past v1.3 you will not need to restore from seed, it will retain this data.
Likewise there were a bunch new features added to v1.3 that are handy. Pin code limit of 4 characters is now 8 characters. You can also add a passcode to the ledger and attached it to a new secondary pin. This allows you to have two completely separate wallets with separate pins on the same device. Handy if you are forced to unlock, you can unlock with the pin of a dummy low balance wallet. 
IMHO the secondary pin/wallet feature and increased pin digits are worthwhile security upgrades. If you wallet is stored in a 100% secure space, ex lock deposit box of some sorts, you're fine. If you tend to carry it, or have it in a insecure place, it's worth upgrading for you. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:52:19
This. Make a small investment now, the rest later. If you are feeling bold, go up to half now, half later. If the ETF fails and prices drop you can cost average the two lots by buying low. If I was in a buying position now I would do about 1/3 or so now, wait until ETF decision, buy 1/3, then wait a few days for dust to settle from ETF decision and by with the rest of cash on hand. 
Right now it would be worth it to dump all the fiat (money) you're going to purchase with into an Exchange (Gemini, if you have to, Coinbase/GDAX) so it will clear faster once you actually buy.

*their. Happy? I'm not aggressively anti BU. I just think they are overplaying their hand. With 70%+ segwit support, and something north of 12% BU support, BU is a lost cost. And I see people rallying behind is to support larger blocks, where in reality Segwit allows larger blocks, and allows larger block scale to be agreed upon but the network, rather than then the BU solution where miners alone get to determine the max block size. It puts too much power in the miners hands.

Just to elaborate on the Jaxx issue, please read this thread:   
Tl;DR user rooted his Android phone. Had Breadwallet and Jaxx installed. He used TitaniumBackup to copy/restore his phone to another phone. Ditched old phone. Goes to open BreadWallet, it asks for his seed, which it should. Goes to open Jaxx... it opens, shows his balance, and works. TitaniumBackup was able to successfully copy his wallet, where BreadWallet was able to prevent it since it uses secure Android Keystore (  ).

For this reason I bought a WD DL4100 NAS. I have a share on there, password protected, which I backup the entire contents of my PC's "Storage" drive to. A lot of these Ransomware viruses will target any network share on your local subnet that it can write to. Having a share which I have windows set specifically not to remember the password for is my stop gap. On top of that, I keep a External drive that's unplugged that has a weekly or so mirrored copy of my storage drive. For the extra paranoid my NAS is also backed up to a USB hard drive that's plugged into it that no user has read/write access to, only system account.

Because you bought on Coinbase. If you buy on Coinbase, the price is at least $5 higher than the current price on their trading platform GDAX. If you go to sell, the same thing but $5 lower. This is on top of huge fees of 1.49%. Also you seem to have a International bank transfer fee on top of it.
Check out Gemini and see if they're supported. They have fair trading prices and charge 0.25% fees instead. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:59:59
Wait. If you already made the decision to sell before the ETF don't second guess yourself. You're better off waiting until the decision and buying in as it's starting to go up, or wait until it bottoms out and buy more.

Locked in. This happened to be in the big dip in early January. I bought 1.5 BTC+ at $1150, then it dipped to $850 and I was stuck. This is why I use Gemini, along with lower fees, as they allow you to sell/buy bitcoin and ether before the deposit clears. They just wont let it leave your account until it leaves. Say if you added $500 in, and bought $500 of bitcoin. You can sell, buy, whatever. However it will always force you to keep ~$500 equivilent in your account until it clears. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:38:46

Exactly. After the major dip and Chinese banned margin trading, everything got a whole lot healthier. We saw two $100 dips recover within a few days or so since then.

I may be wrong, but Bandwidth caps are mostly only a thing in the U.S., correct? I would think they would have less issues and more people outside of the US, perhaps in China could run full nodes easier with less restrictions. I host on a unlimited 100mbit/100mbit fiber connection with dedicated IP's so I have nothing to lose, but most home connections in the US are limited 500gb-1TB.

It dropped on some exchanges as low as 13%. It's since recovered fairly well and is only down about 5.5%. (GDAX/Coinbase). If things go well, it can recover over the weekend, now that China is done selling. If anything it goes to prove its stability.

$1212 to $1107. Then $1107 to $1161. $1161 slowly to ~$1180. Down to $1140-$1150, back up $1170.  The price seems like it wants to recover back to ATH $1170-$1180 price. I knew this would happen, a $65-70 7% jump in one day was way to much, there had to be a small correction. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:33:54

They had a small moon trip recently. From $10 to $20. Seems to be around $18-$19 now with today's Bitcoin issues.

@_date: 2017-02-23 18:55:35
It could be either at this point. If the meeting was yesterday, and they got the "nod" so to say of an approval, it would take a day or two for SEC and COIN to made a media statement and prepare everything for the announcement. The same could be said the other way. If the ETF was rejected, and they are allowing them to withdraw the S-1, they could still be putting their ducks in line and figuring out the best PR friendly way to break the news without shattering the market. It's just too early.

I agree. Bitcoin is being pressured downward to by MAJOR sell events, the BABI liquidation, as well was the Chinese selloff after the end of the extended hold by some but not all Chinese exchanges. This is VERY hard downward pressure. Less than this triggered $300-$400 dips back in January. The most we've fallen is $100 and even that.. I think we were overvalued at $1290, $1190+ seems more reasonable. 
With all this downward pressure, we're holding solid at $1160 to $1190. You can see large swings because of this negative pressure triggering instant $15 drops with large sells. But it inches back as soon as the instant sell and short is over. 
If ETF was approved, even with this negative pressure, we're bound for a LARGE jump. As the negative pressure lessens, even more so.

There was a thread on here last week sometime. A user had Electrum and Jaxx installed on their old Android phone. They failed to write down their recovery keys thinking some transfer utility they had would just copy them over to their new phone, and wiped their old phone once they ran it. Electrum of course, as designed, did not work and he was seeking on advise on how to restore their wallet. However, whatever transfer utility they used allowed Jaxx to just be restored like that on their new phone, which shows to me that clearly something is wrong with it's security.  At least their Android app version.

I would find out the reason behind the fund reversal first before moving onto anything else. If they had a legitimate reason to reverse or cancel the transaction, then I would not expect compensation. If they admit and error happened on their end, or something to that degree, I would expect either a token on their part to make the situation right, given you'd pay about $20 more currently for the same amount of bitcoin ($1035 currently).

Don't jump to conclusions. There was news that one fund had decided it wasn't worth risking their money and bailed early and is selling a lot of their BTC.  Most betting on the ruling keeps swinging between 55% and 45% odds for approve/disapproval.  (  ). Also at the same time some limited Chinese exchanges have allowed limited sending, not the big 3. So some foreign users may have been able to send their BTC elsewhere and cash out finally. I also know a few people that were in it for personal investment only and cashed out at $1280 mark that plans to repurchase after the ETF. So lots of panic *if* selling going on. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:01:50
But your bank does. They have alerts and triggers set up. Any amount over $10,000 gets flagged. They also have things setup to discover if you're trying to funnel money in slowly, ex $1,000 every few weeks for a few months. They'll confront you usually and ask you politely to fill out a tax form.

If a major war happened these days, Network and Telecom would be down or useless. Anyone remember what the DDOS on Dyn DNS was like? Or even just yesterdays Amazon S3 outage? It would be easy to fracture the net apart. Bitcoin could still operate is it can even operate via Tor and other means. However bitcoin would be SEVERELY crippled if any real war happened involving major players. No exchanges would be left online. And what nodes and miners were running, the majority of them wouldn't be able to talk to each other, or if they did would be relayed through just a few that could, that confirmations and things would be CRAZY high. Let alone fees. You'd probably end up with a hard fork or several, and values would be all over, all competing to be the "dominate" fork. 
Sad to say, it would not survive a major war. Gold however, still would. Just stating a fact. I love bitcoin but without technology and communication it's gone.

Yes, 104 is not enough. I use this to judge my fees 
That can get you 300+ minutes, 5+ hours at least. 
I usually go with AT LEAST the first one that starts with 0 minutes if i'm not in a rush.  Right now that's 121-140. Usually I do 0-3 blocks, which is 140-160 right now.

I was able to upload my license and a bank statement instead of a utility bill. They accepted that. (*NOT* a credit card statement, a bank statement). They are VERY fast at processing once you get the documents uploaded, I was verified within an hour or two of uploading documents. Also, once I sent my Wire Transfer over, the money was added to my account within 30 Minutes. The next day I was credited $20 as well to cover (in part) my wire transfer fee. When I also applied for ACH after the Wire Transfer verification was done, it only took an hour or two. Made it just in time to transfer some more money in via ACH for the 4pm EST Auction and saved $3 USD on going price! Loving their 0.25% vs Coinbcases 1.49%. Likewise Coinbase charges $3-10 more BTC/USD than their going rate when you buy, and go $3-$10 lower than their going rate when you sell, unless you use GDAX. If I had used them all along I would have save a significant amount of money. I also use their Index site to track prices through the day.

Yes.. so far I saw a drop from $925, to $890, $915, $898, back to $925, down to $915, all in like 3 hours. Two 2% swings in either direction. Volumes down, but prices are going all over somehow. Not sure what's at play to cause this and would love to understand more.

Well, currently the IRS is going after every Coinbase user from 2015 and earlier, most likely to try and figure out their profits on bitcoin and try and tax them with capital gains as you would huge currency or stock trading would. If they ever do anything with any other exchanges (I am NOT using Coinbase anymore), they could go after you for tax evasion and you'd get jail time and lose all those profits. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 19:14:50

@_date: 2017-01-17 18:18:16

Glad. I bought a bunch over $1100. Bought more near $800 to offset. Gave me a change to buy cheap. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:47:17
Whoops. Typo. I meant to type "I bought today at $925". 
Unfortunately it went up to $940+, down to 900, back at $925 now. It will rise again!
@_date: 2017-01-31 03:48:26
Gemini. Their rates are MUCH lower then Coinbase. Coinbase charges 1.49%, where Gemini charges 0.25%. So if you got paid $1,000 in Bitcoin, Coinbase would will charge a $14.90 fee, where Gemini would charge you $2.50. Both require you to provide identification documents to create an account and add a bank account to transfer it to. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:49:01
Yeah. To offset I bought some at 810, average it and I make up my loss quicker and stand to gain more. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:28:51
Strap in boys....
Happy. I got a bunch at $1144 on Coinbase. Since switched to Gemini for lower fees for buying. Since leveraged a bunch in the 800's. Even some I bought today at $825 already is up $10 in value for me. HODL!

@_date: 2017-01-28 04:14:40


Fixed it for you. 
I used it originally when I first heard of bitcoin. It was when Dell partnered with them to accept payments. NewEgg too, figured they were legit. I used it to buy a few small items with bitcoin. However once I found out their fees were CRAZY at 1.49% vs Gemini's 0.25% I jumped ship FAST. I couldn't switch fast enough. My limiting factor was getting to my bank physically in person during business hours to do the initial wire transfer which took me a week and a half to do. 
One thing I did like about Coinbase, I could do large transfers. It would take 5-7 days to clear, but it worked. And I had a $200 instant limit which bumped to $300 as soon as I left them of course. Gemini is a flat $500/day limit, it took me longer to get my money in via ACH. Although hindsight I should have thrown all my money in with the initial Wire Transfer. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:05:35
Don't feel bad. I bought at $1140 :(. I've since leveraged with lower buys and have ROI after $1008. Anything over is moon for me. Hodl!

Hell even if we hit $10,000, or as little as $5,000, it would make it a YUUUGE problem for me tax wise.  
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:26:53
Yeah. I emailed their support email and they were able to send me a list of "alternate" documents that they accepted instead of a utility bill as I was in the same situation as you. They were very kind and quick to respond as well!

The Cloud - It's just someone else's computer. And in this case they have to make money on it, and if they could make money back hashing themselves they would. For this reason I've never trusted them. I've been eyeing into buying a Antminer as of late and using a pool service and never considered cloud for this very reason. 
Something fun: Being in IT, i dislike the word cloud. I have a Chrome Extension that changes the word "cloud" to "butt" and "the cloud" to "my butt". The title of this thread appears to me as "Avoid butt mining"

I haven't had a single problem with Coinbase. In the past month I've done 8 deposits from my bank to Coinbase no issues. Instant transfers went instant, and all others took within 7 days as they states (One was in 4 days, one was about 7.5, others were exactly 7). 
However, I just made the switch to Gemeni. I'm in the process of adding my bank account to them, as they have MUCH lower rates to the tune of 10% of Coinbases rates. However, I have not used GDAX yet, which has lower rates than their main site, and more reasonable buy/sell prices. Their main site has buy prices $5 to $10 over trading price, and sell prices $5 to $10 under trading price, plus huge fees. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 18:13:17
Well yes, but you'd have to transfer the money in via ACH first to your account, wait 4-7.5 days, then transfer the USD to GDAX. When it was down to sub $800 post crash I didn't have Gemini yet, and did not have time to wait 7+ days for the USD to transfer to purchase with low fees so I had to purchase BTC directly in Coinbase. I paid about $7/USD-BTC over the GDAX price and fees, however long term since we seem stable $900+ now it was a better choice than waiting. The fees and higher purchase price have already been made up in value increase. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 04:39:45
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:45:46
Anyone else notice the indexes are all around the same price? At least the US ones I watch. Gemeni, Coinbase/GDAX, CoinDesk. Right now all are $884-$885. Is this a good thing? They used to have anywhere from a $10 to $30 spread.

Mine was anywhere from 4 to 7.5 days via ACH to a small local bank. However I stopped using them because of crazy rates. 1.49% vs Gemini charging 0.25%. I wasted so much money on fees during my early trading using them.

I think we just got our second wind... (11:15am EST..) $960 on Gemini, $967 Coinbase, $952 for Winkdex, $963 CoinDesk. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:37:32
Yes this too. Gemini charges flat out market price. 
You can sidestep Coinbases +-$5 by first depositing USD (Or any fiat) into your Cash account (A 5-7 day waiting period), then transfer that balance into GDAX   and do limit/buy/sell orders with lower fees and market prices. 
Coinbase can be nice. Gemini limits daily ACH "Instant Buys" to $500/day. You can wire money into it, buy you're paying your bank $20-$30 wire fee for that, and it shows up instantly. 
Coinbase allows $200-$300 (Maybe more since they just upped me from $200 to $300) instant buys that lets you buy direct from your  checking account and be able to trade/sell/buy bitcoin right away with no hold on your account. They also allow you $15,000/ACH transfers a week (More if you spend more). However if you buy this way, you get your coins at the price you bought them for, but you're stuck with them for 5-7 days until it clears and cannot trade/buy/sell them. Boy did I feel stupid when I rushed to buy in the $1,100's and couldn't sell what I bought off when it went under $1,000 to cut loses and buy low again later. However, it did help me get my hodl game on. So this can be handy if the price is low, and you need to buy A LOT right away and dont mind not paying fees, +$5/BTC, and waiting a week. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:30:37
Well, never know how many servers or what type of servers he rolled it out on. I'm relatively new and know you need Antminer like devices to mine these days, but back then was GPU mining still viable? Or even CPU? Not sure what rewards were then too. We know the government has large banks of GPU systems, given the AirForce used to use an army of PS3's running Linux as a cluster too.

@_date: 2017-01-18 19:33:37
I'm not sure how the market will react, but I for one would love to see some more inspections of the Chinese Exchanges. Given just one inspection and meeting last week sorted out a GREAT deal of margin and fake volume in BTC, and made things MUCH more stable. Put them more on level grounds with other exchanges with higher fees, no margin trading and loans. However the market may not like it. Given though a good deal of the drop was fake volume traders getting their money out ahead of the inspections last week... maybe the majority of them are out and it won't be as big a shockwave this time. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:03:05


Correct. It's what happened. GDAX hit $850 at 9am EST, and it's already back to $870 at 10am EST. Wonder if he can predict moon for us as well. Nice bubble where I got a few more bucks of coin that's already valued higher than fees + initial buy. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:50:01

Coinbase does run Dell's bitcoin transactions as well as a few other major businesses. That explains the off blockchain transaction. It's actually why I signed up with them for my first BTC wallet back in the day when I saw Dell used them, so figure they were legit.

Absolutely. They're one of the top trusted exchanges on here. They're linked with FDIC insured banks and such so they require your SSN as well as documents verifying your address to make sure you live in one of the states they are licensed to operate in. Very legit operation. Also, great for you for using Gemini as an exchange! I used Coinbase back when I started and switched to Gemini for their lower fees and auctions. Never looked back!

More or less.
Bitcoin on both Bitfinex and Polo both trade using USDT, which is *NOT* USD. Bitfinex currently has a hold on all incoming Fiat deposits, and due to lack of banks working with them, cannot get any or VERY LITTLE Fiat out. Bitfinex and USDT (Tether) have the same parent company and deal with the same banks. This is why Bitfinex and say GDAX currently have a $100 spread, because $1 USD DOES NOT EQUAL $1 USDT at the moment. 
This is the same thing that happened to Mt. Gox back in the day. Bank transfers were halted for a while before it's ultimate demise back in 2013, and it caused the price to skyrocket because people kept buying/selling and no new money could enter and no one could exit their position, creating a upward spiral. 
Things are a bit different this time though. There's other large exchanges, where back during MtGox days, it was basically it and others that were around were very small. People with USDT can still exit. The only exchange that currently supports USDT to real USD is Kraken. Their ratio right now is about $1 USDT = $0.9211 USD due to immense pressure. People from Polo and Bitfinex can transfer USDT to Kraken to cash out. They also are buying BTC, also ETH and other currencies, and transfer it to other exchanges, and selling or exiting their position. This is show by Bitfinex's cold reserve addresses going down by a SIGNIFICANT amount. HOWEVER, many people have not done this yet, and are waiting for the price to max out before selling on these other exchanges. So once there's a massive cash out, and people stop buying the Bitfinex bubble, things are going to crash and crash hard. Price is increasing with VERY LITTLE VOLUME which is very unhealthy. 
I highly suspect my comment will get downvoted.. but all TA's and everything point to a very oversold unhealthy position for Bitcoin right now thats been created by this banking restriction bubble. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:29:20
Still.. SEC may not like that answer. Who knows though. I just don't think much has changed. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:42:35
For  The SEC would most likely wait and see what happens with BFX though. If it cannot get a bank to back it, and it goes MtGox'd, that would pretty much cement their decision as a firm No. Not to mention there is still the question of what the Winkelvi would do with a hard fork, and since the SEC decision Core/Unlimited debate heated up greatly, although it seems to have been forgotten about as of late since most mining pools announced what they support, and its been stalemated. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:07:14
Also.. some hype about the ETF being reviewed by the SEC. Any bit of news tends to set prices off. 
 I don't know why anyone would ever thing it would get passed by them, nothing has changed. It's still a unregulated market which was the SEC's biggest factor in their decision, along with volatility, and hard fork. When the SEC denied it, sending prices from $1300 to $850 literally in minutes, they almost proved their own point and would most likely use that as evidence in any review. Even if they address Hard Fork, volatility and regulation are still their hottest points for denial. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:24:24
Please review Mt. Gox history. Basically, back then they had bank support removed, and it created a bubble / feedback loop where money couldn't get it or out. 
Person A has 1 BTC. They sell at $500 to make a profit.
Person B buys 1 BTC at $500 with USD(USDT in this case). 
Person A wanted to cash out, but can't send money to their bank, it stays at the exchange. He sees Bitcoin goes up to $600. FOMO kicks in, he buys at $600.
Person B sells at $600 to gain profit. 
Rinse, repeat. Because the money cannot leave the exchange, it leads to a spike in prices because money cannot exit. What's worse is no new money is entering the system. So all this is happening without any new capital being put into the system. Unhealthy. This can also resullt in an exchange becoming insolvent. Say it had taken in $500M in USD for the purchase of Bitcoin, and roughly $500M of bitcoin was held on the exchange. Without any fiat going in, that $500M in Bitcoin can be worth say $700M now, but the Exchange only has $500M fiat on hand. If everyone wanted to cash out at once.. they cannot and would be insolvent. Bad news bears. 
Yes it is different now because people CAN move it to another exchange and cash out..  Which they have. They might have moved it, but they just haven't cashed out yet because the bubble on Bitfinex of people buying hasn't burst yet. Why sell now when it could go higher? Once the steam runs out on Bitfinex, we will see a big correction as tons of people sell.
