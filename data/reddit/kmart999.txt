It’s great to take some crypto and buy a car or house or something with it, but ideally, I’d like to directly pay with it, rather than put it back in the exchange and use fiat.
Find someone who will take it as direct payment.  That way the coin keeps circulating instead of just sitting in an exhange.

Those folk are fine.  
If they thought Bitcoin wasnt going to be attacked, or that the value was just going to keep skyrocketing, then they dont understand what this is all about.  Bitcoin has crashed by 30% or more nearly 50 times since its inception.  It has crashed by more than 60% 7 times.   The global demand for a borderless currency with no central  authority is here, and it is here to stay. 
Maybe Bitcoin wont be the answer, but some CryptoCurrency will be.

No doubt there are.  My statement was poorly worded and really doesn’t represent all aspects to my view on taking advice from younger people.
It’s impossible to fully explain my views in a Reddit response without correcting any misunderstandings or misinterpretations on the fly, but here goes...
While there are certainly countless people of almost all ages who have the experience and know how to provide financial advice better than myself, I still prefer to play it safe.   The human brain simply isnt developed enough at 17 years of age. Especially your prefrontal cortex.  That part of your brain generally doesn’t reach full maturity until you’re approximately 25 years of age.
Now, if person A has a better track record, experience, and cv than person B, I’ll gladly go with the data and ignore age.   But if all things are equal, age is often a tie breaker.  The facts are what they are.  As a group,  people in their teens and early twenties simply make more impulsive and less informed decisions than people who are older and haven’t experienced significant deterioration in their brain for any reason.  I shouldn’t have to cite anything here, this is very common knowledge, supported by countless studies. 
As for considering myself wise, you’re correct.  I do not consider myself wise.  I consider myself open to correction, and willing to listen to the facts.  
When I toss out a blanket statement like ‘don’t listen to someone under 25’ it’s really poor wording and decision making on my part.  My statement doesn’t encompass my entire view, and it isn’t fair for me to expect people to properly interpret a blanket statement like that.  I make this mistake all the time on Reddit, hopefully this is a moment I use to stop making blanket statements that don’t properly represent my own views.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:44:37
Regarding your concerns about my claim regarding 40% fluctuations in the US dollar.
It is disingenuous to use the US price Index as an accurate measure of global buying power.
If you want to see how much a currency is actually fluctuating, compare it to the other stable currencies of the world, such as:
Swiss Franc
Norwegian Krone
When I say the swings occur ‘often’, these are the types of pairings Im referring to.  If the U.S. Dollar is worth $1.05CAD, then a few months later worth $1.40CAD, that is a fluctuation in buying power for that currency in Canada.   
The same size swings are happening with relation to other major currencies with some level of regularity.  Local goods within the U.S. dont see as drastic of fluctuations in price, and local people dont experience fluctuations in buying power like this, but americans travelling around the world experience these fluctuations with regularity.  Please dont attribute all these fluctuations to other countries being volatile, while the US stays stable.  That is not the case. 
As for the saving vs investing part of your argument, I think youre getting caught up in semantics. You say a car is an investment, I say it is both a purchase and an investment.  You say the USD is purely a currency, I say it is a currency AND an investment.  Especially for people in countries like Zimbabwe.
Cryptocurrencies are both investments and currencies.  All that’s required for something to be a currency, is for someone to be willing to accept it as direct payment for a good or service.
If I try and give person A an RRSP in exchange for a TV, that will be a tough deal to execute, but it doesnt exclude RRSPs from having some minor use as currency if transactions like that are possible.   With Bitcoin, it’s much easier.  Buying a house or a car directly with a cryptocurrency is happening more and more everyday.  Without any conversion to a local currency.

I dont know if this is how it works, but there’s roughly 800M USDT in Bitcoin.... so if it turned out to be 100% fraudulent(doubtful) , that would account for 0.4% of Bitcoin’s price surge.  Not much. 
However, a headline that reads ‘800M in fraudulent Bitcoin Tethers Revealed!’ could spark lots of fear and additional selling as well.  
Short answer? Who knows.
Edit:  800m in Crypto, not all in Bitcoin.  Fraction of the total.

This is sort of like having your money be backed by Bitcoin instead of Gold.  Youre not out there actually paying with Bitcoin directly, but youre storing all your wealth in BTC.

A decent percentage of the bitcoin community was tired of waiting for a solution to the slow transactions and high fees associated with Bitcoin.   They were pushing for an immediate increase in block size to fix this, as outlined in Nakamoto’s white paper.  Im not sure that following the white paper matters really... there could be better solutions available. 
The core developers mostly wanted to find alternate solutions to scaling such as side chains and off chain networks.  While also willing to increase block size, core simply did not believe increasing block size to be the correct solution for the long term, nor did they view the tx fees and wait times as such a huge problem that needed fixing right away.  They wanted to pursue alternate solutions to fix the problems caused by the massive influx of new users.   Things like Lightning Network.  Stating that endlessly increasing the block size only delayed the problem.  I agree with this.  But Im also curious to see how a block size increase works as well.  
People like Roger Ver disagreed, and they were tired of waiting for a solution.  So bitcoin was forked to create Bitcoin Cash.   The block size was increased and tx fees and wait times were reduced for BitcoinCash... for now.    Now the two communities spread FUD about each other all the time.  It sucks.  
I honestly dont think Bcash’s solution of endlessly increasing block size is smart, but I still hope it works.  I view it as just endlessly adding lanes to reduce traffic.  What about buses, subways, LRTs, planes, monorails, etc...?  There are better ways to scale Bitcoin than just increasing the block size. 
I also hope Lightning Network works.  
Lightning network is coming along really well and could really save Bitcoin as a currency.  So this is good.   Maybe both will work?
In the meantime, Bitcoin is still doing well as a store of value, and as a means for transferring large sums of money across the globe. 
People over at r/BTC will say the lightning network is a centralized solution created by the banks.   But it isn’t centralized in the sense that one giant entity controls the currency.  I am very excited for the LN to get going and really hope it works.  
My view... it’s really sad that the two communities shit on each other.  I use Bitcoin, BCash, Ltc, and IOTA.  Not because I want those four to explode in value, but because I believe in a future with global digital currencies that are borderless.  Instead of sober discussions about solving the scaling problem, it just devolved into hate.  Money does that to some people I guess.
If there ends up being 10 popular solutions, that’s awesome.   I am really happy to see the market caps of all the cryptos go up and up, but Im much more excited when I hear stories about retailers accepting them as payment, and employers offering them as salary.  That’s the other side of their utility that excites me.  We already know they are resistant to inflation, but how will they work if a few billion users try to use them as everyday money?  That is still a big question mark. 
Many people may end up retiring early thanks to adopting this tech so early, and that’s awesome, but not nearly as awesome as saving the people of the world from the grip of Banks and shady govts that overprint money.

@_date: 2017-12-27 00:13:59
This is the complete wrong way to view it.   For one, many currencies around the world are more volatile than Bitcoin, and in the wrong direction.
Even the USD can go up or down 40% in a couple months.  Not only can it, but it often does.
Right now, Bitcoin isnt really used as a currency, but that is a limitation of the tech, and prior to such massive growth, it was used as a currency by most people holding it.
In addition to this, many people do view currencies as an investment to hold for the future.  Many people put a couple hundred dollars away each month for a large purchase in the future.   If youve been doing this with Bitcoin for pretty much any amount of time, instead of your local currency, you will have been better off.

If by niche, you mean only earth, than ya I agree.
I, for one, would love a currency that isnt at risk of overprinting by my govt.  I would love a currency that doesnt incolve me getting a phone call every time i move more than $2000. I would love a currency that would allow me to buy anything without having to rely on a third party to get involved for any reason.  If I could go on vacation and not have to worry about going to the bank to exchange for a bunch of the local currency at a ridiculous fee, that would be better too.  The list of advantages go on and on... people dont know they want something until theyve tried it.  Life was fine with no cars, no planes, no internet, no phones, no cell phones etc... it often isnt until people try a new technology that they realize how much they actually want to use it.
Anybody can make any kind of currency at any moment.  It’s the one that the people of the world  agree on together that ends up having symbolic value.  The other thousand options are pointless.  Countless alternative options have come out since Facebook took hold, but the people have agreed that Facebook is their network of choice, so it remains the most valuable.

I remember in 2012 when Andreas said he kept all his wealth in Bitcoin.  He also said that he was being paid in Bitcoin.... how is he not a bitcoin millionaire?  Even if you are always using bitcoin to purchase goods, that would be offset by only receiving Bitcoin as income no?

This is one of the few problems I have with Bitcoin, too many coins became available too early, or the 21 million limit is too low.  There’s too few people that own too many bitcoins.  If there were only 5 million bitcoins in existence at this stage things would project to be much more balanced.   
Because of this issue, as well as the scaling problem, I feel that the Bitcoin price represents confidence and demand for cryptocurrencies, not specifically for Bitcoin.  Not this is necessarily a bad thing for the world, just could be a bad thing for Hodlers in 3-5 years time.

It’s on the way brother.  The developers behind Bitcoin are working hard to reduce tx fees and wait times.  There will be small increases in block size, but reducing the data size is a larger priority.  I, for one, am super excited about the multi layer solutions.
It’s not that developers dont care about the scaling problem, it’s that they dont want to rush their solutions.  They know full well that the utility of Bitcoin as a currency is too important to ignore. They also dont want to just increase block size as a knee jerk reaction because that’s what the bible *err, White Paper says.  
There are a couple quality alts out there and the developers of Bitcoin are aware that Bitcoin is going to have to provide strong utility if it is going to maintain its stronghold at the top of the crypto game.  
Ultimately,  it doesnt actually matter which cryptocurrency ends up winning the day.  What matters is that Fiat dies and some secure, private, decentralized, peer to peer currency lives on.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:22:38
This is true.   But people are looking at Bitcoin thinking.... I only had to invest $100 in 2009.  Just $100.  Losing that money wouldnt have ruined anything.   It makes a person think they should just dump like $100 on every single promising new investment possible.

After listening to AA talk about scaling, Im 100% in agreement with him.
Scaling is a problem,  Bitcoin will never reach its full potential if it cant be used as a medium of exchange.  However,  just endlessly increasing the block size is not the answer(BCash).  Yes, small increases in block size are required, but more importantly, the data size needs to be reduced.   Things like LN are crucial at this stage.  It’s important that tx fees and wait times can not only compete with companies like Visa and Paypal, they need to beat them.

That’s not actually correct for a couple reasons.
1) If all my earnings come in as Bitcoin, and my pay is flat, then I will always be chipping away at the Bitcoin loan with my Bitcoin earnings.  
2)The loan would have to have been approved based my salary in BTC.   So, the goal is to negotiate my salary to be in Bitcoin.   Say I make 0.5 BTC per month, that has to stay flat.  
 
That being said, I will gladly take advantage of any bank that is willing to give me a loan in Fiat inflationary currency.  If Banks were smart, theyd give out loans in BTC, not in Fiat. 
The buying power of Fiat has consistently dropped as far back as you look.  BTC will eventually stabilize.

I agree that increasing block size only delays the problem for a short period of time, but it still needs to happen from time to time.   I cant help but disagree with your analysis regarding the tx fees being no big deal.   
So long as tx fees are high, people will always have to keep a portion of their liquid wealth in fiat.  If the main goal here is to undermine banks and free many people from a system of inflation and third party control, then this needs utility.  It needs to be useable to buy a 5 cent candy.  Being able to spend it in this way, means people will be able to abandon fiat entirely if they so choose.  I understand what youre saying about holding.  It’s true.  If everyone just put everything they had in to BTC and refused to let go, that would shoot the price up.  But is that all this is about?  What about helping people who are not privy to a stable currency and a reasonably trustable bank?  What about undermining corruption that relies on banks and govts controlling the money?
Why would I actually even want to hold something that cant do any of the things that excited me about it in the first place?  The truth is I wont.  I will hold for now,I like LN, and if it’s only a couple months away I can wait.   Until then, I have no choice but to hold some of my money in fiat.  If a couple months go by and it still isnt fixed, then im out.   Regardless of gains, I cant leave my money in something I dont believe in just because that’s required in order to keep the price rising.  
  If Bitcoin doesnt fix its scaling problem I, and many others, will simply find a better solution.   Good riddance you may say, but Im basically a bitcoin maximalist, I hate Bitcoin Cash, and none of Litecoin, Ripple, or IOTA have actually solved anything they claim to solve, but if the Bitcoin devs keep pretending like high tx fees are desirable, the market will go elsewhere.  Dont be Blockbuster Video and just refuse to see the writing on the wall.  Bitcoin has come too far to allow the nonsense store of value argument ruin it.

Their claim is that the currency begins with a security system overseeing and protecting the network in its infancy, but with larger and larger adoption, the currency becomes more and more secure on its own.  Like raising a child.   You need parental guidance and protection until youve matured enough to move out and live on your own.
The complexities behind the IOTA system are way over my head, but there are people, much smarter than I,  that believe it will work as a fully decentralized currency in the future.

You have to eat.  Say 100% of my currency is in BTC, I buy bread with bitcoin because i dont want to starve and I have no other currency.   Sure I could switch to USD and buy the bread that way, but that doesnt solve your issue.  
I need clothing and shelter, and bitcoin is my only currency, how else can I obtain those items unless I use my bitcoin?   
Using your local currency for those items is the same as using bitcoin.   Your local currency has a value in Bitcoin, and if you spend it on bread instead of Bitcoin, then by your logic youve screwed yourself out of all that money.

It’s possible.  But I doubt the base strong point of Bitcoin is less than 5-6k.  Not only that, but many hodlers who decide to sell before Dec 10 will do so with the hope of buying more at a lower price, and not with the hope of just getting out.  
If the price goes up(I think it will), those same sellers will just begrudgingly buy back in and stew about lost profits.
Now, other than miners, what kind of dumbass would actually SHORT Bitcoin?

This is a big part of why I believe in the team behind Bitcoin.  They are actually trying to solve the problem.    Thanks for the answer.  
Im not particularly loyal to Bitcoin, im just a big believer in a decentralized, borderless, global currency.  If some team like IOTA, or some other new development, finds a way to solve the problem without sacrificing the core values that matter to Cryptocurrencies, ill jump on board.

One thing that bothers me is when articles or news outlets compare BItcoin’s market cap, or the crypto market cap as a whole, to companies like Disney or General Electric.   Not only does this make no sense, it makes the people interested in Bitcoin think it’s rising too quickly and that it is a bubble.  Those are companies, Cryptos are global currencies not private companies, and not currencies chained to a single country.  Bitcoin having a market cap larger than Disney doesnt mean shit.
Bitcoin’s market cap(200b), and the crypto market cap(340b), should be compared to things like gold(7.7trillion), the world’s physical money supply (7.6 trillion),  or even all currencies(physical and digital) globally(90 trillion). This is all in USD btw. 
When you consider what Bitcoin could become, 200billion isnt even a drop in the bucket.  That is, if it’s purpose is to succeed as a currency as well as a store of value.  Exciting days, early days.

Lots of exchanges charge a trading fee of 1-4%.  It is not a glitch.  You’ll likely notice the same thing when you sell.  Price could be at $12000 but they only buy it off you for $11,700.  Bastards ;)

No, it’s just not a GOOD currency... yet.
It took 400 years for people to switch from precious metal coins to paper money.  You think the value of paper money wasnt volatile during that transition?  
Offering the people of the word a new currency was never going to be easy.  
Despite all that, and despite Bitcoin’s many crashes, it is still far less volatile than many Sovereign ‘currencies’ in undeveloped countries.  
If may not provide the conveniences to people in developed countries the way their stable currencies do.   But that ignores all the countries that actually had currencies far more volatile than Bitcoin.  So much so, that they had to abandon their currency for the USD. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:13:21
How Im reading what you wrote:  ‘Because Bitcoin is a decentralized store of value, this makes it a decentralized store of value...’ �� 
The word VALUE implies that you can exchange it for something of use.  If it is not practical to exchange it for anything, then it is not practical to hold it. 
You cant just declare something as a store of value.  There has to be reason for the value, and that reason has to be a use of some kind.  Do not fool yourself in to believing that Bitcoin can succeed without becoming a medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:56:32
Honestly, depending on what upgrades take place, there could be room for many successful cryptos in 20 years.  
Whether it’s security, anonymity, speed, efficiency, scalability, transaction limit, size limit, or whatever... unless one single crypto can somehow dominate every type of use, I️ can see there being many different cryptos being used for different reasons.
A good analogy is file types.  You may use Word files while I️ primarily use Adobe PDF reader and somebody else uses .txt and someone else uses Excel. All great text readers with different advantages and uses.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:59:32
The value of BTC atm seems more representative of the demand for a global currency/store of value that works free of banks.  Not so much the value it provides to ppl.  Although it does still help people who live somewhere with horrible inflation, or work somewhere that requires they send money across the globe to their family.   
BTC is not what ppl think it is, yet.  But if one thing is clear, that is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  
BTC is just the first mover.  The same as DOS, MySpace, WebCrawler, Napster, Netscape Navigator.
Lots of these first movers did great for 10+ years, but eventually the market finds the superior product.

That’s not true either.   Socialism like that can occur under a democracy as well.  It simply requires that the people vote in favour of candidates that will push for it.  If the people vote for forced distribution of wealth, than that’s what they will get.   That is a democracy.  A dictator might be necessary to keep a bunch of social programs in place permanently, and prevent the people from voting for change, but no dictator is necessary to start a socialist country.  There’s a minimum amount of government required to accomplish this, but government control can be massive in a democracy, if that’s what the people vote for.
The real question is finding the balance between the two, and also innovating peer to peer systems like bitcoin.   Bitcoin is not privately owned by one giant entity like a bank(capitalism), and it is mostly free from government control and regulation(socialism).   Bitcoin is somewhere else.  And if one private entity was somehow able to purchase all the bitcoin, then bitcoin would lose its value, thus preventing insanely large power swings, to a degree. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:58:15
I’m sure many people view it that way, and yes that will drive the price up, but many people in Japan and around the world also view it as a way to put an end to fiat.  Once they realize that BTC hasn’t been built to handle such a monumental undertaking, those people will bail.  Once those people bail, the price will drop, which could easily start a chain reaction of other people selling before the whole thing tanks.  
If core is able to solve the scaling issue without creating a new coin, then great, but if the issue isn’t fixed, I️ just can’t help but believe the coin will fail.  I️ want BTC to succeed, believe me, but don’t be surprised if it fails because it was unable to adapt.

In order to follow the same path as gold, bitcoin would need some other use besides just a store of value.   The good news is that core understands this and are working to solve the scaling problem.  Patience is needed, but the knowledge that smart people or working on a solution is promising.

Derivatives, stocks, and options are linked to real world assets.  Not a good comp.

Being a good medium of exchange and a good store of value are linked.  It doesn’t make sense to me any other way.  If Bitcoin is not an efficient way to exchange goods or services, what is the point in storing any value in it?

Canada accepts impoverished workers from third world countries all the time.  They go there through outsourced employment agreements, with residency included.   After working for three years in Canada, you’re eligible for citizenship.  To just walk in to a country, having never contributed a cent to the local services such as roads, hospitals, and schools, then expect an instant citizenship is unreasonable. 
Despite having to wait for three years for citizenship, you still get INSTANT access to all the public services available in Canada.  You may not be able to vote, but you get healthcare just for living there.  The reason is because the existing citizens of Canada have agreed as a majority that they want to share their wealth to help others have basic necessities. Pushing for equality of opportunity, but NOT equality of outcome.

The store of value argument makes no sense to me.   Visa and paypal are third parties, so they solve nothing.
Using it as a currency is necessary.   There’s no value in something that has no use.  Gold at least has use.
If I cant use bitcoin as a currency, then i will not use it.  Taking control away from visa, mc, amex, and the banks is what I value.  Bitcoin’s ability to undermine that power is the reason im willing to pay $8k for 100m satoshis.  Being a decentralized ‘store of value’ isnt possible if you have no reason to be valuable to people.  What value is bitcoin if it provides nothing for people to do with it?   Just being decentralized isn’t enough on its own.

Bitcoin Cash is just an upgraded version of bitcoin.  If you’re interested in a peer to peer decentralized currency, BItcoinCash is the better option at the moment.   If you’re interested in a ‘store of value’ and nothing more, go with bitcoin.  
Once Bitcoin upgrades the block size in order to make itself competitive with Bitcoin Cash, it can be useable again.  Until then, it isn’t useful as a currency.  Transaction fees and wait times have to drop.

You’d need the dollar to be worth 0.0007 of its current value.  Which wouldn’t mean 1 bitcoin would be able to buy what 1 billion 2017 USDs could buy, it would just mean nobody uses the dollar anymore.
if the dollar completely tanked and bitcoin 100% took over, you’re looking at bitcoin being worth 2-3million (in 2017 USDs).  So when someone says 1 Bitcoin could one day reach 1 million, they are essentially saying that it could one day be as commonly used in the marketplace as the USD.  Which isn’t all that insane, but the technology has to improve.  Wait times and transaction fees have to go down.

Getting a passport is relatively easy.  In canada, you can obtain citizenship after living and working there for 3 years.  No I’m not being obtuse on purpose, I’m suggesting that taxation is an important part of maintaining a country, and to suggest that a gun is being held to your head forcing you to pay taxes is stupid.  
If you participate in tax evasion, then refuse to pay anything after being caught, then somehow empty all your bank accounts and only take cash as a form of income so as to avoid judgement, all the while using public roads, police services, fire departments, schools, etc... I’d say you’re a criminal who has bigger issues other than just being anti government.  Bitcoin may be anti govt to a degree, but asking citizens to share a portion of their income to help maintain the country is very reasonable.  There is no gun to anybody’s head forcing them to pay taxes, it’s what the people have agreed to do as they have voted for multiple representatives and policies since the birth of the country.   
If there is a country out there that is being run in a fashion that you believe to be preferable to your place of birth, nobody is holding a gun to your head telling you you can’t take the necessary steps to obtain citizenship there.  Nobody cares enough about you to try and stop you from doing this.  It is within your right to go out and make it happen.  To expect it for free when you’ve contributed exactly zero to other countries is silly.  If you want it, go out and get it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:09:43
Why would you save any money that suffers from inflation? Incentive is to just spend it all while it is worth more instead of put away for retirement.

Once they go forward with an upgrade to help increase the transaction limit, so fees and wait times drop. I’ll immediately jump back on.
I️ enjoy using all my cryptos as currency whenever possible.  That is the main reason myself and many others have them in the first place.  
If Bitcoin decides that it will never upgrade in any way shape or form, I’ll never jump back on.  It just isn’t practical for me.  I’m not here to invest, I’m here to use a currency that undermines a banking system with too much control over governments and policies.  
If you feel that Bitcoin can succeed as an investment without being a functional currency, great, I️ hope it works out for you, I️ really do.  In the meantime I️ know myself and many many others will be using whatever crypto currency suits our needs best.  
One of the huge advantages I see for bitcoin is that it already has the largest acceptance of all cryptos by retailers.  For this reason, I️ am still confident that the necessary upgrades will take place, and once they do, I’ll be excited to use bitcoin again.

My thoughts are this:
Most owners of businesses would probably accept gold or silver as payment if they had to.  The main reason they don’t advertise it as an accepted form of payment is because people just don’t have gold coins and bars lying around.  At least that’s my guess.  
Gold and silver also work as jewelry.  If you remove the jewelry market, I’d bet gold and silver would tank.  
Gold worked well as a currency because it was limited, and hard to counterfeit in a convincing fashion.   Why Gold was chosen over something with similar properties is anybody’s guess.
Bitcoin is rare and limited in quantity, but it really can’t serve a purpose for anybody if it isn’t being used as a currency.   
If Bitcoin fails as a peer to peer currency, it will also fail as a store of value.  Of that I️ am certain.

If you owe X% in tax, in Canada you can preemptively donate X% to charities that qualify and then legally write it off.  Thus controlling how your money is used to help others.   You can do this for up to 75% of your income.   If you feel your money will be better served going to something like RedCross as opposed to the government, that’s your call.
As long as you’re educated on how well your govt manages the taxpayer money, and how inline they are with your own values, you can make a pretty educated decision as to whether or not your tax money should go to charities or to govt. 
Things like roads, schools, police, fire dept, hospitals,  parks, etc... rely almost entirely on the good tax payers of the country, so I’m more than happy to pay the tax man.

That would be like saying every time you buy anything with USD instead of putting that same amount of $$ in BTC, youre losing out.  
If all my currency is already in BTC, Im only a victim of poor spending habits.  I’m less likely to blow .02 BTC on just anything, but I also know that the money I put away for retirement will be able to better keep up with living costs than it would for a regular currency.   Deflation is more of an advantage than a disadvantage for both a currency and a store of value.

Trying to predict crashes and surges is more dangerous than just hodling.  Bitcoin may dip back down as low as $1000, it may only dip to $4000, it may rocket up to $20k and never go below $10k again, nobody actually knows for sure what the market is going to do.   That’s why I just weather the storms and buy during the dips/crashes.
I believe in the technology behind crypto currencies so strongly, that I think BTC could even surpass the USD in its everyday usage.  For this same reason, I don’t actually EVER plan on selling all my cryptos.  I plan on eventually switching up to 90% of my liquid cash to crypto currency.  This may be bitcoin, it may be something else, but it won’t be fiat.  
Just like cable tv, record stores, video stores, etc... banks and fiat are dead, they just don’t know it yet.
I own BTC(80%),BCH(4%), Monero(4%), Dash(4%),  Litecoin(4%), Eth(4%). 
And if another alt comes in to play, maybe Verge?, that I believe shows promise, I’ll buy some of that as well. 
I have no actual loyalty to BTC, I just want the best available option to become the norm, and I can say with certainty that it ain’t FIAT.

Depends on which country you live in.   In many countries you don't have to pay taxes on the gains until you convert back to your local currency.  So in theory you could just keep it as bitcoin, spend it as bitcoin, and never pay taxes on it, but you should.  If you're making great gains, help out your country and pay taxes on capital gains.  That's the agreement you make by remaining a citizen of wherever you currently live.  Pay the required taxes on your income.

Question:  In order for Bitcoin to legitimately compete with currencies like the pound or the USD, what would the market cap have to be and what would the value of 1 bitcoin have to be?
The market cap right now is only 67Billion compared to 3.3 Trillion for the USD and 1 satoshi isn't even close to holding the value of a penny. 
the Canadian dollar only has a market cap of like 650-700billion while being 80% as valuable as the USD... 
I don't understand how this all works... please explain.  
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:01:56
How about 5-10 years.  Seems more realistic.
Once one Satoshi is worth 1 penny, bitcoin will be fully global.  Until then, it is just the Napster of currency.  Hopefully it has a better fate.  File sharing never stopped, but Napster sure did.  
It still baffles me that there are people out there paying real money for software, music, movies, etc...

Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, not an investment.  If people only consider it an investment, and never use it as currency, its value will ultimately fizzle out.

These responses all make sense.  Maybe I should have compared Bitcoin to .wav vs. .mp3 files rather than Napster.   
File sharing will always be around, regardless of how it is facilitated, but the file type that is most commonly used is a good comp imo.
Maybe crypto will be a space with many options, like file types.   .doc, .pdf, .jpeg, ... ... .TORRENT
Lots of filetypes out there that work well depending on the preference.   But .Torrent sort of rules them all no? Unless you actually still pay for software and media.

Well, gold has other uses.   BTC's only use is as a currency. 
If all anybody did with gold was buy and hold it, what value would it have?  Being rare is pointless if you have no use.  Gold can be used as a currency, as jewellery, as a tooth etc...
Good luck getting Bitcoin plated teeth.

Purchasing and accepting bitcoin is necessary and provides many benefits in the right circumstance.  I enjoy the anonymity, the lack of fees, and the separation from my bank.  It just goes from one blockchain wallet to another.  I don't have to worry about exchange rates since some of my transactions are with people out of country, and I never have to worry about a court order seizing my bitcoin because there is no bank the courts can force to seize my money.  I still use my local currency for most things, but that is on the way out.  I just make sure to keep my bitcoin balance floating.  Whatever I spend, I immediately replace. 
Face it, people enjoy making trades with others without worrying about reporting the trade.  It's nice to have a global market of people that can provide each other with goods and services, while at the same time not involving any banks or governments.

It's funny, the skeptical 'experts' keep making the same claims about BTC's problems, and they just don't realize that those problems are actually the strengths of this technology.
I read it all the time 'unlike Oil, there's nothing there, its value is purely dependant on people buying it.'
First ask yourself, do you believe in the idea of any currency that is just a symbol?  Because that's all the USD is.   A valueless symbol, that 7 billion people have agreed to accept in exchange for a good or service.  
What makes one currency more valuable than another?  The following:
The difficulty to counterfeit said currency - check
The stability of the currency - not there yet
The cost to use the currency - check
The ability for the people to audit the creation of the currency - check
The amount of people that agree to accept this symbol in  exchange for a good or service - maybe one day 
This technology can easily meet all these requirements, and already does in most cases.
The fact that this currency is global, open-sourced, and not regulated by any single country/power is really one of its best strengths.  BTC is open sourced, and is essentially audited every single day, by the people.  It is insanely difficult to counterfeit atm.  The fact that it is global also promotes the idea that it will one day be the most stable currency in the world.  No single country will be able to affect its value to a degree that is more measurable than the effect that country can have on its own currency.   
No more banks.  No more bank fees.   No ability to just inject any amount of BTC in to the economy in order to bail out a failing corporation.  
It seems so obvious.   It might not be BTC that wins the day,  but some global, open sourced, digital currency  will be the way of the future.  No doubt.

‘If history repeats...’.  That really isn’t how markets work.   Sure, There will be corrections to large rallies, but the truth is, bitcoin could skyrocket to $20k in the next 5 months, or it could plummet.   Nobody can truly predict with certainty.  There are millions of people trying to do exactly that, and the few that get it right post their results as if they’ve figured out how to predict crypto markets.  It’s total hogwash.  If you believe in the technology, the last thing you should do is wait for a dip or try and predict the future. Just jump in now.

I think another great way to spread the word, is to use bitcoin around friends whenever possible.  Don't get preachy, that is annoying.  Just start using it as a currency, what it's meant for.  Let others see you use it wherever it is accepted.  
Once people start to see others using a more secure and less expensive currency with ease.  They will be inclined to join.  Having a ton of people buying bitcoin isn't nearly as valuable as having people accept it for goods and services.  Spending(not selling) bitcoin is what will help.

Having a cryptocurrency for one specific country sort of defeats the purpose of going global and knocking down borders imo

I don’t consider it an investment.  Errr, at least I didn’t.   I was using it as an alternative to local currency whenever it was a cheaper and more convenient option.  
‘Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.’  You shouldn’t have to post this for people to know not to do it.   If you’re investing more than you can afford to lose, that’s a mistake no matter the investment.  
On the flipside though, most people are investing 100% of their earnings in their local currency.  Bitcoin puts that currency at risk.  The more people begin to adopt Bitcoin, the larger the risk will be to continue using your local currency.  In many countries already, bitcoin’s volatility isn’t as significant as that of the local currency. Venezuela is a great example of this.  
Bitcoin is in a place right now where public interest is growing rapidly, but if the fees don’t drop, the convenience doesn’t increase, and the anonymity gets lost, the value will fizzle away, and a superior crypto currency will take its place.  
BTC’s primary long term value cannot be as an investment.  It has to be as an alternative to Fiat.  If it fails to be a superior option because of scaling issues, or something else, people will have to switch to an alternative crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:12:47
Using bitcoin debit apps defeats the purpose imo.  Because you're just doing in instant currency exchange that includes fees.   What I'm talking about is having Amazon post their public wallet address, and we just send BTC directly from our wallet to theirs, no third party.

This isn't completely true.  Yes 99% of the time it's just an instant conversion to local currency that occurs.  But there are also cases of merchants accepting bitcoin as a wallet to wallet transfer instead, since there are no fees or paper trails.  It has the potential to be so much more efficient and reliable than any local currency imo.
All it takes is for ppl to start offering it to others directly. 
Hiring a painter to paint your house?  Offer bitcoin as a wallet to wallet payment.  There's  no transaction fee or bank fee, it's anonymous, so no bank record, and it's just as fast as interac.   They might surprise you and say yes.  I would.
Also,  let's say the government demands to see your bank records, and you refuse, they can get a court order and force the bank to provide them with your records, or place a judgment on you and take money from your account.   How can they do that with Bitcoin?  Who are they going to force?  I own some bitcoin and I can't help them get the records of some other bitcoin owner.  There is no corporation like BoA that will do the court's bidding.
This doesn't mean I'm against paying taxes, because I'm happy to contribute to my country's well being.  I'm just illustrating some of the benefits bitcoin provides. 
Local Pawn shop owner might also accept it.
The smaller businesses that prefer cash payments are the ones most likely to accept bitcoin at the moment.  But if it really catches on, than larger businesses and governments will have to either try and stop it or join it.  
It takes a snowball to start an avalanche.

The interesting thing about this meme is that, in theory, it should make a ton of sense when the Bitcoin market nears parity with the USD.  At that point, people should start bailing on their local currencies at a rate that simultaneously causes BTC to go up and fiat to go down equally.
