Actually, it wasn't a mis-quote. Jeremy Allaire was slightly wrong in what he said to CoinDesk. He later clarified what he meant to say, so CoinDesk updated the quote. Information was added to the bottom at the same time as the update was made.

This is useful for finding local bitcoin ATMs:

I think that's a great idea. Would be a good one for BitPay, Coinbase or one of the other merchant solution providers to get involved in.

What a load of nonsense!

A front for what, exactly?? Lunatic.

I understand what you're saying, but I'm sure most of their users don't give a damn about how stressed they are. They are failing to provide the service they have been trusted to provide. Their emotional welfare doesn't come into it.

Any idea how many bitcoins were stolen?

Has anyone contacted IAFCU to withdraw their funds yet? I'd be interested to know how smooth (or not) the process is.

That article doesn't PROMOTE Mecardo Bitcoin, all it does is mention that Superinteressante uses the company to process its paywall payments. How is that a promotion?
@_date: 2013-07-19 17:14:23
Oh, is that so???
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:10:30
Is it broken? No merchants are showing up at the moment!
