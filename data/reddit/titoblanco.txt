PayPal is a private company, this is just the free market at work. I hate how there is so much overlap between the Bitcoin crowd and the red hatting moron crowd.

Do you happen to know if this is an internal Chase policy, or is this a regulatory requirement that they are getting out ahead of?

You should really think of your phone as just a small piece of disposable hardware that is a portal to a vast global network. With the free and easy sync tools available no data or information that has any value should not be kept solely on  your phone. And any data or info that is compromising at all should not be kept on there at all. Fortunatly this time it was relatively cheap lesson for you, it could have been much much worse. Really replacing your phone should just be a matter of getting a new one, inserting an microSD and/or sim card and install a few apps and within minutes you are back in business like nothing happened.

American's savings are the lowest they have historically been in decades. Meanwhile corporate cash holdings are at record highs in part because they are borrowing at rates that are artificially low.

As much as the profile of BTC has increased in the public conscience just the last couple months They are probably right on time to make a ton of money selling video cards. But the wannabe miners, yeah they are probably a little late.

One reason Bitcoin is popular in Iran is that it is the only reliable and arguably legal means currently available to send remittance from the U.S. to Iran. If they restrict it in Iran they are turning off a faucet that is effectively defeating the U.S. OFAC restrictions and sanctions.

Silicon Valley is in a bubble where money isn't really tied to real-world value. Twitter has a multi-billion dollar valuation and hasn't turned a profit. Maybe it never will it it is 100% speculative. The fact that people with access to billions in capital think BTC is going to $100K really doesn't mean much.

Not really. The main affect of the sanctions is that it prevents large U.S. corporations from doing business in Iran or with Iranian nationals. Large corporations already have the means to send funds to financial institutions in or through third-party countries today. The risk of being hit with OFAC penalties is why they don't or why they use other methods to skirt OFAC restrictions, not the burden of sending funds. So IMO, even with widespread adoption Bitcoin in Iran it is unlikely to have any significant immediate affect on sanctions, except in the area of remittances which is a relatively small financial volume and arguably not in violation of OFAC anyways.

I don't think it is insane. More than anything it will target High Frequency Trading algorithms that execute hundreds or thousands of trades per second and exist solely to manipulate the markets

This is particularly interesting to me in the context of the countries that are currently under trade restrictions like Cuba and Iran. In fact it came up on a few days ago. OFAC, which is the department of the Treasury that enforces trade restrictions, does not restrict non-commercial family remittance to those countries. Banks can transfer funds through third-party banks for that purpose, but do not because they cannot ensure that the funds will not be used for unlawful purposes. Since the banks won't do it, there is currently and underground money transfer system. In the middle east it is called "hawala." The transaction itself is not-unlawful, though unfortanaly the hawala middle-men take a significant fee, and some view that as a commercial transaction which makes it in violation of OFAC regulations even though the banks that could lawfully do the transactions would still charge a commercial transaction fee, I don't see the difference. Since bitcoin is friction-less I don't see why sending non-commercial remittance to those countries through Bitcoin would be unlawful. Obviously once the funds are sent the sender they are out of their control and if they end up in the hands of an unsavory person or used for an unlawful purpose that is a whole different potential issue.
