This is why we need some middleman in all this. 
I don’t like holding my cryptocurrencies in wallets with my own keys. I like to hold on Coinbase and Uphold. 
If something happen with my funds I know I can call Coinbase support and recover my money if they detect that my account was compromise ( They have a insurance policy for hack funds ) 
If you lose your funds in your own wallet there is nothing you can do or contact with.

Bitfrex took money out of all accounts to recover losses from a major hack. Even USD balance. I heard this in the past few days. You should check.

Bitcoin is not going to drop 20%. You sold at the 4,000 level and now you are going to get REKT.

I have 5 and im 19. I feel very proud. I always had my name next to the number 22 in all my internet usernames. I believe this is a signal of the universe that by age 22 ( 2022 ) I’ll be a Bitcoin Millionaire.

They are clearly promoting the left agenda. 
Democrats are afraid of the Bitcoin technology. Everything that give individuals more freedom and independence from the state is a threat for them. 
We must keep using Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as our method of payment. 
They can steal our USD, but not our Bitcoins.

Hyperinflation wont occur here in the U.S. is very unlikely, specially after the Federal Reserve raising the interest rates yesterday. We are heading to a low inflation period. Not deflationary , but with very low inflation. If the FED decided to not raise interest rates then chances of suffering inflation would have been higher. 
The USD was devaluating too fast. 
Also the Federal Reserve is planning to raise interest rates even more by 2019, at least two times. So is gonna be a hard time for president Trump to keep the economic hot.
