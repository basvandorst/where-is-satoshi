I agree it is not a bank... but Bitcoin DOES make it possible for any person to create their own money-management service utilizing bitcoin. Banks can't stop this from happening (unless they already into murder) as they are no different from taxi companies trying to stop Uber.

I'm not really worried. At least not for myself. From the technical side of things, we need to remember that Libra is going to be regulated and the central corporations governing the technology will most definitely impose restrictions and limitations on smart contract deployment. This fact alone will keep a significant % of the population from using it. I don't see Facebook giving anyone the freedom to create their own token, Dapp, or whatever creative thing you can think of that can utilize blockchain... not easily at least. Which means that demand will continue to exist for cheap and easy contract deployment (i.e. tron, ethereum) in many parts of the globe...
To me this all means that value will always exist in pseudo-anonymous and decentralized networks because demand for it will always be there. Worst case scenario is that decentralized crypto stays cheap for a long time (though it will never disappear)... but just re-reading that makes it sound like something a banker would try to tell me.
This means that Libra is going to still have to compete, and it will try (I think) by being interoperable with other blockchains. Chances are, the early Dapp's that cause, at the least, a mainstream fad will definitely have origins from a decentralized network. So Libra is most definitely going to want to capitalize on your entertainment (by taking all your transaction data) as well as capitalize off selling you BTC, ETH, TRX, etc. so that you can game away and do whatever activities exist at that time. 
Anyways, at the end of the day no one knows. Libra could still be successful, depending on what they do.

One key word this post puts in my mind: SERVICE.
It is obvious that we are seeing a rather drastic change in how people are able to offer services to the public. We no longer need a middle-man company to "verify" the integrity of the service provider; instead these platforms exist to remove this middle-man and bring 1000's into the market who otherwise would be unable to do so both for subjective reasons as well as straight up being ripped off by the middle-man companies who pay far less than a service provider could be worth.

I bet you wouldn’t have these problems if the price was moving up lol. Its disgusting how banks are trying to make it as difficult as possible for people to get into something that will hopefully ensure their own future. The banking cartels really need to go, and the world will squeeze them out eventually.

Bitcoin is the most inclusive network in the world. Only requirement to join is be human (human programming bots to pretend to be human is ok too). This is how you begin slowly fixing the global racism issue, and bring people to realize we are all the same species with the same goals at the end of the day.

I wanna say less than 10 years... it very well could have already started. But being more conservative with predictions is generally the safer way to go. I learned to keep very specific predictions to myself, and perhaps only share them with well-trusted people. That said, I am waiting for the next financial crisis precisely because crypto has not yet lived in one. I am genuinely curious as to what will happen. The next couple of years will be a roller-coaster.

Lol its hard for people like us who are into the tech to view it from a perspective of a simpleton. The average folk (like my mother-in-law who believes everything word for word on CNN) will be scared shitless to have the responsibility of hiding their private key and maintaining crypto assets themselves. When the time comes for people to start owning crypto for day-to-day needs, they will naturally trust their bank to take care of it for them. Banks have been taking care of the average folks finances for centuries now, you wont just see a sudden exodus of bank clients. The old-school people will keep crypto in a bank, while slightly younger (albeit non-techsavvy) will likely choose an emergent crypto-holding service that will probably be cheaper than your reputable banks. Regardless of all the features that exist, remember that 99% of the human population will never understand the guts of crypto the way we do. They will only be the users, and will inevitably be exploited in one way or another. Thats why I totally see banks pulling off something akin to Mt. Gox just at a much larger scale. 
I dont trust banks at all, I hate banks probably as much as you do and will NEVER let a bank put a finger on my crypto, but we are a niche population of humans right now. When the masses come in, the masses want a piece of mind and ease so they can continue jerking off and doing whatever they do.
On the topic of DEXs, I was just in a thread where someone was saying that although they are the inevitable future, they are far too inefficient with clunky interfaces to hold a fair match against more efficient centralized exchanges. DEXs just need more time. My favourite dex is switcheo but it is quite dead. Tech is still new and fresh!
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:15:39
My only issue with this is that probably 95% of people who read it won’t get it. Most people don’t realize know how important it is to keep your own keys let alone what a private key even is.
That said, I thought it was funny lol.

Haha wishful thinking:p old people are extremely closed minded. Atleast in my experiences. But they sure as hell love to force you into believing what they think is right!

Watch the majority of the public is going to first choose to store their crypto at the bank, where the bank keeps the private keys, or doesn’t even hold majority assets in the crypto the people think they own. This will last at least a cycle or two, or maybe a bit longer, until the banks get too comfortable with this and once again start some sneaky scheme akin to mortgage backed securities (a la pre-2008) and the whole system collapses again except this time people lose their crypto because you cant just print more crypto. Hopefully by this point the population will have better adopted crypto, and following this event will encourage standard folk to safe-guard their own private keys instead and hold in their own wallets.
In other words, big banks will absolutely pull off a Mt. Gox at some point in the future, and itll be a huge huge deal. So long as no single bank has control of the currency printing press, it will spell doom for banking. I feel bad for old people who will fall for this.

This is partially my reasoning for not owning BTC (or even trading in BTC). I also do believe that other technologies (smart contract platforms, for example). Did I get fucked? Hell ya. But I still hold faith. That said, if BTC hits 3k I will buy.

You know this really REALLY does remind me of the evolution of World of Warcraft. Yes I am comparing two very different things here, but at the end of the day, both are technology, both are periodically updated, and both have a buzz-word name that no matter how well you try to fight, the name just always wins. People have been saying that the only thing that can beat World of Warcraft is World of Warcraft (which I think we now see with the release of classic).

No we shouldn't. Mining difficulty does not mean confidence is growing. It could be a few whales who decided to shell out big funds on a mining rig and added themselves to the pool of miners. Realistically, this is likely what happened since bitcoin mining is considerably expensive to get into at this point in its life. A few extra miners do not speak for the droves of NBC-brainwashed people who still think crypto is stinky.

Technically theres under 18 million btc (or around there) in circulation. Will take 100 years for the remainder to be mined. Even so, there are fewer bitcoins than millionaires who definitely can afford 1 BTC. Lets just say I hope I have 1 whole BTC before something major happens lol.

Thats why we are seeing much more resentment to blockchain than we saw resentment/fear of the internet.

Hypothetical thinking now, but what do you think would happen to the value of Bitcoin, if every millionaire in the world today wanted to buy 1 bitcoin?

While solid compensation is absolutely due to his lawyers, I feel like this is also one of those cases where lawyers may be competing to represent him. The publicity this is going to have will be enormous, and I imagine this case will absolutely have long-term effects on the chosen lawyers future career/reputation.

Almost feels like hes a modern day Jesus of sorts. Not by starting a religion (or spreading one), but by uncovering truths that corrupt individuals are hiding. If he were around a few 1000 years ago, getting nailed to a cross would be an appropriate punishment.

Most people don’t understand their own psychology, let alone the macro psychology of an entire population. This is why mankind is where it is today, precisely why governments and corporations can get away with the things they do, and entirely why the majority of people will never be rich.

Bitcoin 2 would not be the same as bitcoin. What you are proposing would be two seperate blockchains with different addresses and transactions. Rules could be the same yes, but it still would just be its own entity.

If I were any vendor that accepted crypto, I would charge a premium while crypto prices are high (like right now) and cut a deal when crypto prices are low.

If you are thinking in the short-term, then yes the world would be screwed. The transition cannot happen overnight. It will take many, many years before the world fully adopts cryptocurrency. It will get easier over time so that people over 35 will be able to use it. Remember that 95% of the global population will never understand how blockchain works. Those of us here today are the lucky few with brains that can comprehend this tech and appreciate its complexity. The challenge now is to make this tech faster and more intuitive.

The Indians can still do things for you in a decentralized world. The job those Indians would be doing just does not exist yet. From a technological point of view, maintaining centralization is illogical. Mankind currently has the problem that we are far too greedy and untrustworthy when it comes to distribution of large quantities of wealth. Centralization enables this behaviour as we tend to be a species that will exploit anything we possibly can for personal gain. A decentralized system of exchange, on the other hand, does not prevent greed or make Human's better people, instead it systemically removes the ability to abuse the system the way it is possible in a centralized environment. In other words, decentralization allows for a more fair system of exchange that cannot be tampered with. Does not mean people won't try, but it is a rather obvious technology that is likely to re-shape global finance.
