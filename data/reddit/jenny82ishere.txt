If you are a non-citizen resident, and you have income, then you still have to pay taxes. People are not required to report how many bitcoins they have, or how many gold bars, or how many lawnmowers or hammers.
Tracking and enforcement may not be easy. By law people must report gains and pay tax on them. If it's a small amount that is all cash, they are likely to get away with underreporting. If it's thousands of dollars through KYC exchange that gets deposited to their personal bank account then all bets are off. Must report that or face consequences.

Bitcoin can not be double spent. Replacing transactions in mempool does not spend coins more than once. Coins are spent only once when transaction is confirmed. Other transactions attempting to spend those same coins will be dropped. Services crediting accounts prematurely is not a double spend. That's something their system does before getting the money. Accepting zero conf is basically a bug.
The term double spend is being misused and it's annoying.

This never happens. No one can take anything from my wallet.


Bitcoin is censorship resistant, not fast, not cheap, not for microtransactions, and does not have a zero-conf option. Merchant may act like zero-conf exists, but it doesn't. Merchants in physical stores may take the risks if they need to, however adding bitcoin option to appease 0.001% of their customers does not make business sense at the moment anyway.

I don't see an issue. Cash is paper money and has nothing to do with bank accounts. Money in the bank are deposits belonging to the bank and are mostly electronic, with only an iou in your name. You cash out by literally having someone hand you paper money in exchange for your bitcoins.

It didn't happen today. And it wasn't 400 million. More like 320ish. If you think that's close enough send me 400 million dollars and I will return you the "close enough" amount of 320 million and keep the difference. Also it wasn't 43000 BTC that was moved.
It is much more likely that the round number 90.0 BTC was moved, and the rest was change.
There are reports that this is an exchange owned wallet, so these coins could be owned by thousands of people, not some whale.

The point of saving money is NEVER to be buried or cremated with it. You don't have to spend it yourself on yourself. You can leave it to relatives. You can donate it. "Hodl forever" is not the point.
Your naive hopes that btc is some kind of hedge against crumbling banks is cute. It may be a tool in your arsenal for that eventually but it should not be the one and only basket.
Btc is a collectible asset. It has a price point. People have different needs and at certain price point they will sell. Get over that.
As for assigning specific reasons for btc to exist.. That's more than a little presumptuous. You saying btc was built to dismantle banks or whatever.. That's maybe the least likely thing btc will do. And claiming it was built for reason x or reason y is claiming to be able to mind read. Put away the soapbox. Use bitcoin as it fits your life. Do not tell other people what you are doing and ffs don't tell them what you think they need to be doing. Your premises about why btc exists are false. The resulting conclusions are erroneous.

You're comparing to a shitcoin. Eth has its own names, like archival node. Irr-fucking-relevant.
For bitcoin I know of 3 things.
1. Whether it's pruned or not. In my mind pruned is not full. I think some people said pruned is full.
2. Whether it can accept incoming connections, i.e. open port. This one is debatable. I think without port forwarding the node is not full.
3. Whether full signature validation is enabled or not. By default it is not. So this point is also debatable whether assumevalid=0 must be set to call that node full. I think all sigs must be checked for it to be a full node.

The phrase is "for all intents and purposes."
The point is, it's likely someone withdrew 90 BTC from an exchange (which is still quite a bit of money). Because bitcoin works a certain way, utxo with 43K btc was spent.

But... it was 650K. It's like someone writing I showed up to a party in $100K worth of stuff. But they omit to mention that I drove up and stepped out of my car which is worth $99,700.

You don't even need the physical device or ledger software to do this. People have already thought of all of this. Nobody would buy a lock-in wallet that requires permission to use. Manufacturer would spend money on R&amp;D and go out of business sitting on unsold inventory.

Between Standard American Diet and vegan the latter is much better.
But.. I see proponents of vegan on YouTube doing their presentations and they look thin and sickly with skinny necks and arms, and shirts looking a size too big.

Bcash does not have zero-conf either. It's a copy cat of bitcoin, remember?

Well, I'm not using bitcoin as money or currency because it's neither of those things, obviously. Also yes, because of cap gains calculation requirements I only buy and sell on exchanges a few times a year sometimes harvesting a gain, and sometimes a loss, as needed for the tax year. Furthermore, bitcoin cannot scale today at all. LN is complicated and reckless. And almost NOBODY accepts bitcoin directly. Getting fiat via Bitpay or Coinpayments, or other token-to-fiat processors is not "accepting bitcoin." In contrast I accept bitcoin, but not as remuneration for my work, unfortunately. I can accept it for selling stuff from the house on sites like craigslist.

Bitcoin has properties which are desirable such that it can be used as money. But sometimes cigarette packs, drugs, even [tide detergent]( is used to pay for stuff and most people will agree that tide is not money.

It does have unique and unprecedented properties and I grant you that, but.. Functions of money include store of value, which bitcoin does not do with its price volatility.

My point was that people choose to have separate money. Some countries use USD and some peg their own paper to USD but not everyone does. Even when it doesn't make sense for them. USD still works wonders when I pay with it. Despite all this thin air bullshit about it. Just about everything around you exists and works because of fiat. And the planet has never had one single money. And likely never will even if bitcoin exists.

You may be referring to a checkbox on the form that asks about cryptocurrencies. While it may be new box for when you file next year, almost nothing else has changed. Guidance from March 2014 states that disposition of virtual currencies requires cap gains calculation and reporting. To nit pick: crypto does not need to be reported on taxes if you just hold it, or only move it between your own wallets. If you trade it, sell it, pay with it for bubble gum - that's  when reporting requirement kicks in.

There is no encryption in bitcoin. There is a signature algorithm and a few secure hashing algorithms. Signatures and hashes are not encrypted data. They are standard length, even if signed or hashed cleartext data was quite big, and they cannot be decrypted, which "encryption" implies. You can't get 8TB of data back out of a 64 digit hash string.
No, you can't skip the difficulty adjustment. If you make 2016 blocks in one minute your next difficulty will increase 4x because you're mining too fast. 400% increase might not be much for a QC, but after just a few 4x increases things may start slowing down.

Entirely different. 38 encrypts the priv key with a slow algo so it's time expensive to brute force.

This is false. It's like saying you're currently a fitness model, underneath all that fat. You just need time to chip away all that flab to reveal the six pack. Coins which weren't mined yet don't exist. They can't be spend obviously.
But my point was not referring to whether 21m coins exist or not. They obviously do not. What I was saying that there will not be 21m exactly. There is no line in code that says once 21m is reached stop creating new coins. The limit is reached by halving. Once 0.00000001 reward era runs through its 2016 blocks, the next halving can't split the sat anymore. That's when reward stops. Totaling 20999999.9769. Which is extremely close but.. is not "21m *exactly*". Furthermore, miners messing around with settings can claim fewer than their full subsidy. Couple years ago looks like miner didn't claim any BTC and got nothing for their [block]( There are a few other blocks that shaved off a little or a lot off their allotted reward. Therefore, I reiterate" *exactly 21m btc does not exist, nor will ever exist.* The actual number now and at the end is smaller. It's not even a whole number. It was like [18,095,871.044972]( yesterday.
Bitcoin being a currency or not. Yes, this one is polarizing. I don't think it is. It has properties which are desirable such that it can be used as currency. But sometimes cigarette packs, drugs, even [tide detergent]( is used to pay for stuff and most people will agree that tide is not currency. We don't need to discuss it further. "A woman convinced against her will is of the same opinion still."

LBC is legit but you trade with scammers, it requires ID, and 4% in fees. Use a real exchange like gemini, coinbase pro, kraken.. and you don't have to deal with scammers and fees are 1% or less.
No ID, eh? Try to withdraw your money from LBC. Just do it now. All of it. Good luck.

Legitimate giveaways like this enable the fake ones to proliferate.

Gemini, coinbase pro, kraken. No records means your cost basis is zero and you can't prove long term hold. So you are taxed on whole amount at your tax bracket rate.

Exchange is not a wallet. Use recommended wallets only.

Hmm.. why? There is no encryption in bitcoin.

No. Not mentioned anywhere and I doubt IRS will bother unless there is return on investment for them to track that.

I see shitcoin logos. No respect.

Usdt is a shitcoin. PayPal doesn't accept those. You need to sell for usd. Move USD to bank account. Then move it to PayPal, though I don't know why you would want to hold funds there.

No. That's a made up reason. Jut like many others.


No. You can work for bitcoin directly.


It doesn't. 


You don't. You can sell your labor.


People who say that likely don't have a lot of fiat in their bank and live in a country where they never faced a serious conflict with their  own government.

You're asking about internals of some online service, not about bitcoin. Ask the service support directly.

Bitcoin makes blockchain necessary. People put up with it, being slow and having to be replicated so much, because bitcoin has value. Saving data in a linked list has little value. Without an incentive to maintain an unbreakable chain there is no reason to even have a chain. Just save your shit on S3.

WTF is up with these people naming shit with X in it? SolidX, ErisX, MegaMan X?

If you had gain you pay tax on the gain. I'm not sure what's difficult for you to understand here. You can't avoid taxes by gifting away appreciated assets. Otherwise everyone would be "gifting" their stocks to each other every year.
I was wrong about sender having to fill out a form under 15k. If value of gift exceeds 15k the sender fills out form 709.

I have a keepass file with like 300 entries. Makes sharing my passwords with others very convenient.

Thanks for the rich and detailed layout of your experience. I laughed and I cried and felt like I want to read this masterpiece again. What a rollercoaster of emotions. Someone alert the Literature Nobel prize people.
