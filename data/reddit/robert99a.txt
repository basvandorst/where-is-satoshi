When was it "not safe"?

When you retire, you will sell back to fiat?

I have read so many bad things about Coinbase.  
Not sure I want to try them at all.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:04:42
anywhere between $0.00 and $2999.99.  I'm not sure yet.

Some say it has, some say it has not and other people (me included) say they don't know.

Thanks. I sold all my bitcoin after reading your post.

I remember the Coinbase app in 1955.  It wasn't that bad.

Congrats!  Don't forget to put some money aside for your taxes.

What do you mean it's going down?  It's up 11%.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:39:51
That is a weird question.
If there were ways to get $300 in BTC or just $300 cash fast, then everyone would be doing it.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:32:59
i'm not.

How do you know this?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:26:50
What country do you live in?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:30:44
Are you sure?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:29:55
I don't think the prices are going up.  I saw it at 194 this morning and it's at 172 now.

How do you buy coins with your credit card?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:53:50
Maybe it's easy, maybe the fees are less, but they are selling the bitcoins a lot higher than they are worth so you don't save any money.  Right now, 1 BTC = 66 CAD but the cheapest BTC on sale on localbitcoins.com goes for 84 CAD...
I'm surprised people actually use that site. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:39
When prices drop, it is time to buy not sell.  You sell when high and buy low, normally.
Since I have no way of buying nor selling, i'm doing nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:37:41
I know what you mean.  I live in Canada and it seems I can't buy bitcoins here.  The only site I know that works here charges fees to deposit money, to withdraw money, to buy coins and to sell coins.  With all those fees paid, there's barely any money left.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:24:57
If you need more bitcoins buy some.  If you don't need more bitcoins, don't buy some.  If you don't need your bitcoins anymore, sell them.
