Is it likely a individual created Bitcoin? Of course many silent geniuses walk around. What makes more sense? A government that is maybe been repressed and shut out of traditional banking systems? A forward thinking government seeing the future. Most transactions are already digital, e-transfer, your paycheck. You just open a app or webpage and see numbers, it's all done digitally. Now I could be totally off but this is just my opinion. A government has more means and a bigger agenda then a solitary person. They can mine it on a huge scale if they were in on it from the beginning they could have been hoarding it. They can use it to manipulate the markets and crash currencies. Look how many jobs and other alt coins were created off the technology that Bitcoin was founded on. Just a few thoughts.

Joke is a Government created Bitcoin we just don't know who. We don't know the end game or the motive, The United States Navy made the Tor network. We have no idea who created bitcoin

Your love with fiat is misplaced. I doubt you see your money; paychecks are directly deposited into a bank account. You see numbes on a screen, you get etransfers, most of your payments are through what? I assume you use a banking app. My point is your dollars are already digital. You cannot walk into your bank and withdraw a large amount without a hassle. Bitcoin can be sent for such low fees anywhere in the world. If you know how to use it anything can be bought, and it can be exchanged for fiat if needed at any point through numerous methods. This is the early stage the masses have not caught on yet. Fiat is based on nothing but the word of whatever government prints it. Times are changing, every government is looking to make their own version of Bitcoin. Each country will have a crypto currency backed by their dollar. We have not seen the top end; McAfee might be right Bitcoin can hit highs never seen before and we may never see again.

Bitcoin is the future; do you know how long it took dishwashers and microwaves even computers to become mainstream and everyone use it? Once it's accepted globally the price will sky rocket

So if this is timelocked and sent will it confirm on the blockchain? But is unspendable until a certain time? And can only be unlocked with the private key? Explain

As in its volatile it's kinda high right now I was going to cash out at 7600 then it started to rise Friday. I'm thinking will it go down and buy then or just pull the trigger.

Well I'm in this space as I can cash out gold for Bitcoin. I am a true believer Friday I was due to cash out for some reason I didn't. Now here we are.
