Do a wire transfer of your funds to GDAX instead of buying on Coinbase.  They are the same company.  You only pay $10 on GDAX end and whatever your bank charges. Then set a limit order on the exchange for the price you want and get your coins for practically no fees.

When you buy anything through the coinbase app they charge a "service fee" percentage that is a couple percent which is normally a lot higher fee then just wiring money to gdax and buying on the exchange. The only way to save money is wire/ach to gdax and place a limit order.

Your funds are also locked if it goes down. Wire your funds to gdax then purchase your crypto next time to save money on fees.

So what would the price discovery method be if everyone stopped buying and selling on the exchanges?
