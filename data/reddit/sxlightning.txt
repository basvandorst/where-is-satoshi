Now litearlly everything I have is bleeding.

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:02:34
dont bother, at this rate BTC will be worth nothing by tonight.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:07:38
And if the options was given for you to pay less, most people woudl take it without even thinking about it lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:13:12
not bubble just an "controled" dive to the ground.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:18:54
Not even that expensive, I got a comfy gaming chair of ebay, its soft and supports my back. It was only $100. Less than all that RGB lol 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:46:14
You mean in 2014, I even downloaded their software and was about to mine and decided nope. like a idiot. I will get a time machine and go back to kick myself.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:13:08
Yes but is there solutions for the UK, we can't really use EURO or USD as we get hit by massive fees and only coinbase allow you to buy with credit card, still like 6-7% fees once you bought the coin...
I would love it if someone can tell me a way to buy cheaper bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:10:04
Hey, I am all for short bear markets, I am literally bleed $100s per hour here lol.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:20
Yeah no where near what your banking so I won't be investing, i will let my investment ride out. if nothing happens and I lose it all, I will learnt my lesson and not invest in this again.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:18:33
I was about to say the same, Spends 1.5k + on pc spend $5 on chair.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:05:17
Yes. I want myself to learn a hard lesson :P
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:46:22
some 4th dimensional coin that exist now, the future and the past. It is owned by everyone and no one.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:44
Fear, uncertainty and doubt.
I put 7k into crypto to play around guess I joined at the worst time.
Look at halving my investment within 2 days, should went to the casino and put i on red or black.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:44:04
Yeah they probably just increase what is called a BTC, to BTC/1000 and call that a BTC then all sorted the vlaue is not insane anymore
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:46:55
buying bitcoin is pretty hard in the UK lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:57
technically I already experienced the 20k dip haha. but since I bought in Nov I was in profit still so it didn't matter this is the first time into the negative. I bought at the "dip" too at 14k. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:37:13
yes but as some point this wont be true anymore. sure buy the dip worked when its going up but now. Its just one low after the next.
I am lossing faith.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:34:42
I really hope you dont.
I believe in crypto is here to stay but I just dont see it going back to 20k anytime soon. earliest would be July ish. latest could be another 5 years of bear market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:16
Yeah when I started I wanted one and realised I can’t get one. Maybe if I traded a bit but nope 1 is a bit too much
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:46:17
bitcoin had a bullrun, even a monkey could made money and looking at trendlines. It is really TA if you do it on Forex market where it goes up and down dialy but flat overall.
You can draw all the lines you want, bitcoin will bull run again and people will think you are a god for predicting it. until the day it does not.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:11:20
I thought there was news? when it reached $1000, I remember the news was all over it. can't remember if it was good news or bad news.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:43:31
people who bought at floor 200, is now halved their investment.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:05:29
Only if bitcoin stop falling lol, currencly I am buying nothing, into the negative.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:39:57
Could this be the reason bitcoin is dropping?
people who want to buy can't and people who want out now has no buyers.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:43:00
Is that a bad idea? I think its a great idea currently if you get lucky buy a 0.0001 coin and it rises to 0.1 that is 100x your money, put 100 in get out 10,000 is not bad, repeated it twice and you will have 1,000,000
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:39:16
GDAX still cost money, when you transfer ££ to EURO you get hit by conversion rate.
It is still way higher if I had native euros to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:36
I will just wait it out. I don’t need money right now. I will let it ride 
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:18:38
But some people have a lot more than 1k lol.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:30
Pretty damn high fees
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:41:53
not as brutal as when i bought in jan or when it was 18k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:41:31
I did just sign up to revoult but I have no more money to invest anymore. but its useful app for money conversions when I am visiting abroad. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:38:10
Interesting I might have to check that out. 
Been wanting to invest in some index funds to go along with my crypto stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:49:43
stop with this bullshit, Its been a long time since anyone threw out a government in the west. Its not going to happen,
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:23:05
Yesterday is my birthday, what a great birthday present LOL
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:43
This is true, but people here say you are FUD.
I seen this happen before in the Stock crash in china, people lost everything.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:56
good call a tesla would be good, I have a super charger next door to my house.
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:52:04
What is robin hood? I never heard of that brand?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:06:58
-20% since when I bought it at $280.
What moon
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:06:11
dont bother, search for 8k meme as when you get back we will be 8k
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:14:36
I dont think anyone is using it, its just transactions from exchanges of people buying BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:10:40
You think you can vote them out? look at the last 50 years of UK's elections, its just the same thing same problems. America is getting more divided every day because of the problem the goverment causes over the years, Its not all trumps fault, its him and every president before him.
What are you going to do? vote for the opposition? its just same shit with different sprinkles. 
But yeah governments can change from something dramatic,
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:38:05
give it few hours we will be at 8k then 7k then 6k by end of day and 3k by tmr and 1k by end of week.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:08:03
no its not still does not work
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:29:48
hit the nail on the head
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:18:31
A ten times rise. Is not normal. There is a point where a ten times rise will be more money than all other currencies combined, will you still go by that logic? 
I do not understand the logic behind people who follow bitcoin blindedly. It is not going to take over the world it will just be another small currency alongside the other currencies. Sure there is a market for crypto currency but it’s not going to reach 1m that will make bitcoin the dominate currency which won’t happen.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:19:57
I don’t believe that one bit, who ever owns the key has lost it. He probably made it as a test account and just forgot about it or misplaced his key
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:31:25
Next time before you comment on people's stuff make sure to get your own facts right.
Nothing worse than to call someone's stuff fake when its real.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:06:37
Isn't that how we all get rich? or have I been doing it wrong all these time.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:28:58
hmm strange, my friend tried to buy 1 month ago and he could not sign up with nationwide because of this reason probably.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:21:02
Invested in it when it mooned now I am just sitting here waiting for it to go up lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:00:07
I find that really hard to believe, the US or another country will outright ban bitcoin to protect their currency and what good is bitcoin when its banned.
I would prefer bitcoin to coexist with the other currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:03:05
I have to admit I got weak and sold my LTC but HODL my bitcoin.
I have since Bought my LTC back in the mess I lose 1.5 LTC lol.
I learnt my lesson, always HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:40:30
Don't you find it strange that he has not sold? I mean his literally a billionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:22:23
and earns you literally nothing lol. while you can just invest in it and sit back do nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:33:50
They really don't like the name Bcash do they, I never understood the hate on that name, is sound ok for me, much easier to say than bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:32:07
Rolex does earn money, a rolex from 2003 is now worth 2x its value
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:15:37
I would buy it but I am in a different country
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:47:45
3-4 bitcoins for each watch.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:03:14
So you are telling me to buy nothing other than bitcoin.
I need a car to work but that could earned me $40m if I bought BTC instead so I shouldn't buy the car?
Also, he didn't buy the watch in 2011. he bought it today. and if you are expecting a 100,000x (200,000x if you take into account the 2x according to what you said) rise in BTC in the next 6 years then you need to seriously look at your expectations.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:43:26
I had to build up a decent size deposit before buying my house as I didn't want to invest it for less than 5 years as I would told that runs the risk of potential market crash and you would have your money stuck for another 5+ years. 
I know a lot people say that renting is just as good as investing in a house but I am old fashioned and like a place of my own, good luck on your house, once you get it, that is one less thing to worry about. I just wish bitcoin can rise to a point where I can take a chunck out of of my investment and pay off my house. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:20:25
The only thing I don't agree on is that it will replace the current currencies. I dont see the USA becomming weak enough to lose the grip the its currency and there is also the EURO to contest their no 1 position. I think Bitcoin will do well and take a chunch out of fiat but not over take it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:38:35
Yeah, that is 250k......... I dont even have that much in fiat money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:59:18
But that is a real problem. I hate it when my raman soup splash on my rolex
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:57:45
I mean I wish I had that but I dont even own 1bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:32:16
Not anymore, bought a house so I am sitting inside a asset? But I mean if you live in a first world country and is about to buy a house you probably have that much sitting in your account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:04:00
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:21:19
your telling I can lose money if I put all my money on black? I won the 3 times I put it on black, statistically speaking I should always win because I always won before /s
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:55:35
That is such a flawed logic, you are overgeneralising and using flawed data.
Bitcoins, has never encountered anything like this before. Sure you can extrapolate the data and say it will rise but the price of bitcoin can not go up indefinitely. 
Literally everything anyone says is just speculation. Lets keep it at that, I would love for bitcoin to reach 1m.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:23:44
Can I ask where I can read of these estimates? seems interesting
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:19:38
Its talk like this the no one will take the crypto community seriously.
I prefer if some cryptos turn into something like gold and some turn into a usable currency like fiat.
When you shout down with centralisation and down with the government you will attract the attention of the wrong people
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:24:02
If he invested it 4 years ago and for 3 of that years nothing happened, you would forget about it too.
I think I have few thousands dotted somewhere but unless I look in my excel list I can't remember where and when i put the money in.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:30:01
Someone became rich from all that too. even in that bank.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:42:59
Banks does a lot more than just store money. They give out loans/mortgages which I don't see how BTC can do the same. no stranger will trust me to lend me 20 BTC to buy a house on the basis that I will pay him back with interest. Now you need people to be paid in BTC otherwise you could end up in a cycle of never paying off your loan as BTC price keeps going up or you can instantly pay it off as its value drops to nothing.
Literally BTC need to replaces wages, prices of items, tax, for it to work. Which I doubt will happen, I can pretty confidently say that wont happen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:04:43
If you always look at the poor people how will you be rich :D Gotta poke your heads in the clouds 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:04:12
But people just buy in the billions and millions it makes no difference...
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:09:24
250k, Disgustingly rich? Its not that much money. most people have 250k easy.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:37:38
USA is not representation of the world.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:44:21
Not when all the rich people start buying BTC and start to price us out lol and artifically inflating the price and dropping it to make money like they do wiht gold.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:51:27
I will hit it and break the moon apart, on to Mars
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:57
I think he Lost the wallet lol. He probably created it as a test account and just lost it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:26
These shitposts are getting boring.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:39:34
I was just trying to say 250k is not disgustinly rich, its average.
Disgustingly rich is like 10 million +
1 million is like Rich but I would not refer to them as disgustinly rich, they probably live just like me and you with just a few more luxuries (better car, bigger house).
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:33:22
I agree and disagree, we need to be taxed a tiny bit but what we are getting taxed right now is way more than we should.
Fuck the benefit system (keep it for the disabled) stop handing out free houses to anyone to fucks a tramp on the street and has a kid, people are literally having kids in the UK just so they can have houses. 20 years later all their 5 kids gets a house.. so on and on and now they cheated the benefit system and got out with lots of houses now worth a fortune.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:25:17
Can you not just invest the fiat into something like a house, land, objects that gain money over time. Isn't that what gold is for?
Stocks too but risker. something like an index tracker will generally outperform inflation so you can have fiat just not in a savings account.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:37:28
My point stands, banks will stay, blockchain is not going to replace the banks, at most banks will just start using blockchain tech to run their money, like ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:06:39
I also have a mortgage on top.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:29:49
hmm, I bought like a few days ago, when was this
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:20:04
people been saying this since 10k, I bought in at the top I will ride it down the bottom, a few thousands is not the end of the world if I lose it all.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:42:33
Dude its like the first time its down since like forever. Why does everyone slag it off. In concept bitcoin is better but it is just a concept no one (hardly anyone) accept it as a form of currency yet.
@_date: 2019-02-23 13:14:57
Why dont you buy 2 phone, one for storage and one for phone
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:09:12
well it was bitcoin which introduced the start of all the other coins which in term made graphics cards super expensive
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:58:22
Yeah I was going to say those miners are like $3000-5000 each haha. That’s is 36x 3000 which is 100k+ at least 8 months if bitcoin stays at the cirrent difficulty and the same price.
Which I doubt s it fluctuates so much lol he could do it in 4 month or 16 months lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:05:21
Or he buys back in at $100 and be laughing at you who held through while he tripled his money
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:24
I don’t know about that some country count heat as pollution so you can’t just dump warm water back into rivers and stuff but if it’s not that hot then maybe it’s ok
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:00:13
So fucking what it’s working. You an keep singing in your bubble it’s not going to keep growing it will crash and then it will probably be pumped again later on.
I am more invest than most but even I don’t think it will recover this time soon maybe in a few years.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:08:26
You must heard "poopies" which is what some adults say poo to childern
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:09:41
You mean Bitcoin cash.
