"instead of investing $1000 all at once, you invest $100 weekly for 10 weeks" 
**This is DCA**
" I don't have a large sum of capital to put in upfront so instead I put in smaller amounts every week" 
**this is NOT DCA**
A lot of people here think DCA is when you buy small amounts, but for it to be called DCA you MUST have the amount of money upfront. If you do not have it, you are not averaging anything, because there is nothing to average ... you just buy at intervals because you have no other possibility.
Small edit - it has also been proven many times, that DCA in itself is not a good strategy in general (once again, if you get $100 from your paycheck every month to reinvest, you are not using DCA and this kind of investing is probably okay if the market you go to has upwards trend)

Segwit is already in the current system.

That's the problem with European "super", "brut" and "net" income. It leads people to believe they pay less tax, because they are lead to believe they are taxed on the brut, while their employer pays something else out of his pocket. What the employer pays "for you", is tax on YOUR money - if you had a business contract instead of employment contract, you'd be paid the "super" income and after pay in all the taxes all by yourself you'd have different perspective. 
To make it really transparent, you'd have to remove all employer contributions and pass them directly onto employees, so they see the exact number they are taxed for. But that would probably end up with next revolution, which the socialist governments do not want.

People sued N26 for long KYC delays and won.. just saying.  Imposing a deadline is purely a process invented by a bank, and is not based on any KYC legislation (at least not on EU level).
Since you already fell into the KYC bullshit, you can not avoid it now. The key to speedy processing is to answer only question they specifically ask for, and nothing more. No one cares about your life story, story behind the business or anything. Whoever is handling your transaction needs the boxes ticked, the less material he has the faster he can tick the boxes and let it go. Of course, if any information they ask for is missing, that may lead into delays, so be careful on that.

Real crime cartels do not use BTC, as there is not enough market cap in crypto to fulfill their needs.  Some scriptkiddies selling bots or hackers who stole BTC on exchanges may tumble with you, but your chance of having cocaine smelling dollar bills in your wallet right now is way bigger, than having some flagged coins form a coinjoin. You can also re-tumble if you do not like the coins that resulted from the mix. After a few tumbles/exchanges it will become impractical to follow the tainted coin anyway, as it will be distributed among thousands of other people.

It is still questionable chart choice. The whole point of logarithmic scale that people asked in the "linear" thread, is so that you can see the movement on the y-axis. By starting at 0 you "squeeze the pixels" to the same space, and basically don't add any more information compared to linear chart. Good approach is to completely omit ranges where nothing happens, in your case that would mean starting at 400-500M mark or so. 
2nd problem is the data itself - there are multiple ways of calculating realized market cap, and the most common one is that you value each transaction on the account by the price at the time. Your numbers do not seem to reflect this formula though (maybe you value account balances and not individual movements?), so it would be nice to have the description. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, but it would be good to know which one was used.
Btw, nice example of this particular chartcan be found at  [

\ - government agents .. Hi there :)
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:55:50
There's a big difference if you deal with territorial taxes (US citizens are subject to them) or you do not. I guess a lot of people here assume you are an US citizen and that makes things way more complicated.
Anyway, since you mention DK/DE - no EU country has a territorial tax, so if you move your permanent residency to another member country you should be fine. You still have be careful when doing that, because permanent residency is only one factor taken into account when determining your tax residency, and changing permanent residency between member countries does not automatically mean you have changed your tax residency. Having a "centre of interest" (you are employed, you have wife/kids there, still own a property etc..) may make you subject to tax in your country of origin no matter where your permanent residency is. 
As for how would the Danish govt know. Let's say you are a Danish native, with dual French citizenship, permanent residence in Spain and you own a company in the UK. You want to open a bank account in Germany.  After passing some KYC bullshit in the bank, they would actually send your end of year statements to Denmark, France, Spain and Germany automatically. If you opened a business account, they would also forward it to the UK government. At the same time, before the end of year (usually in november), the bank would ask you to file a declaration of tax residency. Some people wrongly asusme bank will share info only with country you mention there. This is not the case, and this declaration will be included with their end of year statement to all the governments mentioned.
This sharing of information is quite common in the EU. They do not wait till someone asks, it is automated in every bank I've ever dealt with. What happens next is up to the government official who gets assigned your case, they may just delete it and not care, or he may look into you more.

There is absolutely no comparison of any strategy there. And there is no test mentioned anywhere on the site (not sure where thesoleprano saw it). The only thing that the website shows, are potential DCA gains over some period, and comparison to gold or other assets. It is not a comparison of strategies.

You say to stop timing the market, and then you proceed to picking up a specific point in time, and by doing so you just timed the market. This is an incorrect approach to evaluate any investment strategy. You can not time the market, but that also comes around - just as you cannot use a specific point in time to say Lump Sum is better, you cannot use the same to say DCA is better either.
Based on your wrong pick, you also state wrong conclusions - "No one who has done it for more than a year has lost money." is simply not true. There have been downtrends lasting for more than a year in Bitcoins history, and you would be in negative numbers during those (with both DCA and Lump Sum). On top of that, most of the time in Bitcoins history, you would make more money just by sticking it in rather than trying to DCA.
Anyway - here are some actual numbers  ;)  [  \- I evaluated performance of both DCA (12 investments over a 1 year span) and Lump Sum over the entire history of Bitcoin. The article is a bit long to go deeply in the method used, but if you do not care about it just skip to conclusions.
TLDR of that is, that Lump Sum beats DCA majority of the time. Even after cutting the pre $100/BTC era out (which would heavily favor lump sum), Lump Sum at its average yields slightly more than DCA at its \*best\*.
DCA will "work" and cut down your losses, but you forego a lot of possible gains, which may be more devastating than the loss of initial investment.

If your btc is already withdrawn, then I would not reply to them at all. If they stopped the transaction but did not freeze your account, I would do another withdrawal to my personal address, and once that clears out, I would work with that. If they froze your account, I hate to say but you'll have to deal with them. Just remember - no one doing KYC cares about your story, they just want to tick some boxes and be done with it. Do the minimal replies, do not post more information they asked for, and it should go through.
Btw, it is a bit late to say this now, but sending BTC directly from exchange to exchange is really not recommended. (storing btc on an exchange is not recommended either btw). You lose a lot of control in this process, and your transactions are tied to some centralized 3rd parties. On top of that, with new AML being prepared in the EU, the regulated exchanges will be forced to attach your identity to this kind of transaction as well, so the receiving exchange has all the history the previous one collected.
Best way to sell smaller amounts is to use bitcoin ATM, you can locate one on  [  . The site lists KYC requirements as well as fees charged. Make sure to double check the fees once you are at the ATM though (scams do happen). Where I live no one bothers to do KYC for transactions below 5000E, this may vary depending on the country you live in though.

Robinhood does not and never sold any Bitcoin. It sells a derivative product based on bitcoin's price. This is why it is impossible to cash out in BTC. If you want to move funds out of RH, you have to close your position and cash out fiat. One side effect of this is, that you are not entitled to any coin that would result from a Bitcoin hard fork - because you do not own the coin in the 1st place.  (kinda like buying options on a stock, does not let you profit from dividends paid on that stock).
Crypto exchanges do not operate this way (Kraken, Coinbase...) and they sell you actual BTC, that you can move to your own wallet.  As long as you use a "trusted" exchange as your 3rd party, you should be fine. Of course, there is always the risk of exit scams (many happened in the past), but you should not hold any assets you are not actively trading with on the exchange.

This is not true for scenario described above (long term storage/hodling). If you generated a few receive addresses and then disconnected your ledger, you do not need to care about it for a long time. If you buy once a month, you can have 24 addresses generated, and come back to using ledger in 2 years and update it then (or recover the seed on a completely new device).   Your security is in no way affected, and there is absolutely no need to plug in the hardware just to update it and store it away.

Trezor One - small, cheap, monochrome screen and 2 buttons - most of operations like entering pin or words is done on screen (buttons are just for OK/Cancel most of the time). When user input is required, numbers or letters are mixed and shown on Trezor One. On the PC, a dotted grid corresponding to these numbers/letters will be displayed, and you you click with mouse on dots. That way, if someone has a keylogger or screen recorder installed on your PC cannot get any keys, seeds or pin.
Model T - bigger, more expensive with color LCD touchscreen. All the operations are done directly on the device, so there is no mouse clicking on the computer.  .
I own both, and I find the touchscreen much more convenient, as it is much faster. I kept One as backup device, as I couldn't say anything bad about it (except the speed of entry when recovering a wallet, it takes a lot of clicking). Both support well over a hundred shitcoins. The only "major" coins exclusive to Model T are XMR and XRP (in total there is maybe 10 coins you can't get on One, but I doubt anyone has heard about them or would consider them relevant) . Both devices can be flashed with "Bitcoin only" firmware if you do not care about shitcoins though.
So yeah, no matter which one you pick, you can't go wrong.

Most people I know (me included) use btcpayserver, as you can control the whole experience and do not rely on 3rd parties for anything. It does require some setup though (as with anything self hosted).
There are also people/sites who can host it for you, and since it is non custodial it is quite safe - the server does not need to store your private keys, so if it gets compromised they can't empty your wallet. It only needs public key to generate receiving addresses for each invoice.

If you say "uninstalled", I suppose that you deleted the program and not your wallet.  You have to delete the default\_wallet file, and then create a new one based on your recovery seed.
After creating a new wallet or recovering from seed, Electrum will ask you for wallet password in order to protect the file in case your laptop gets stolen.  That password is only used to "unlock" the data stored on your hard drive. You do not have to use the passphrase, but you really should.

This entirely depends on the ATM provider, so it will vary from one ATM to another. Of course, it should not allow you to sell more than it has, but the limit per transaction may be actually lower. Also, you may need to go even lower if you do not feel comfortable with KYC requirements above set thresholds.
Also, ATM's that can dispense bills usually have more money inside them than they can actually spit out. This is due to their design - many designs have completely separate validator-storage and dispenser systems, these will dispense just the bills that were put in the dispenser part of the ATM by its operator. Other machines will use bill recyclers which enable them to dispense some of the cash regular users have put in through the validator. So even if you see someone just before you buy $1000 worth of BTC, it does not automatically mean that you can sell for $1000.

I do not see any reference to any test on the website. They don't even claim they actually did any testing. I don't even think the aim on the website was to do that.  The test is just OPs (and yours) claim.
Also, what you say here about DCA is exact opposite of what studies (referenced in a post above) show. I rarely see it recommended for long term investment.

To me, the biggest problem of Shamir Secret Sharing is the sharing part.  You basically have to tell your "friends" you have enough Bitcoin to care about security, and now they own a piece of it... 
If you do this because of succession, then you actually have to tell those people who has other keys so they can reconstruct it once you are gone, but will they wait? What if someone catches only one of them and force them to divulge this information?
If you do this for a company or just for yourself, multisig will be better. If you do it for backup, just have one that is really secret and well protected.

Hello everyone. This is my 1st article in a longer series of Bitcoin related studies (heavily inspired by a similar study done on stocks). I’ve decided to kick things off with a rather “controversial” topic that pops up quite often – How does DCA compare to Lump Sum investment? 
The format is rather long and extensive, but I’d like to keep some sort of audit trail while doing this – as in, publishing the sources along as I go, so anyone can check the numbers and correct me if I am wrong. Sources are available on Github as well.
Any constructive feedback is more than welcome. Do you like the “longer” format? Would you like to change anything? Do you have any comments?

You can look at order books on exchanges, 100 BTC is really not unheard of, although larger transactions usually happen OTC and are not listed on public market.

I should also add, that eToro is NOT a crypto exchange and does not allow withdrawal of BTC (or any other crypto or asset for that matter). When you trade on eToro, you are trading a derivative product based on Bitcoins value (CFD in their case). You are \*not\* trading, and do \*not\* hold the Bitcoins shown on screen. The only way to cash out is to close your positions and withdraw fiat. Same goes to RobinHood.
There is another side effect to this - if a hard fork happens, you will not get to claim the coin that resulted out of it. They may give it to you, but they have no obligation to do so.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:35:36
In that case, it is weird. Coinomi uses the same derivation path on all devices. I tried one wallet now on ios, android and PC and it works fine. This can mean:
- you used a passphrase on top of the seed

- you have incorrect seed

The website is completely empty and provides no information, so the information you provide is all we have. Anyway:
\- I do not see how would you attach a national ID, drivers licence or passport to that thing, because that would constitute counterfeiting an officially issued document.
\- Uploading any kind of private keys to cloud is stupid (especially when it comes to Bitcoin or any other crypto).  For small purchases and daily transaction you can just use any mobile phone wallet (on iOS you also get their wallet up for all your CC's)
\- Biometry is used for what exactly? It should be used only locally, not for any kind of online authorization or authentication.

There are 2 different points here. One is the question of pricing in. Yes, BTC is very good asset to invest into.
\&gt;   its a statistical fact now that its the best strategy thanks to this website  
is simply not true, because they do not compare DCA to \*any\* other strategy. I think the site would be more accurate, if they compared at least with a lump sum investment at start of your chosen period. I am not sure if that is omited on purpose, but lump-sum would win over DCA for most of the periods chosen. 
Of course, this does not take into account what your investment goal and risk appetite is.  If you want to minimize downside risk, then DCA may work. If you care about maximizing gains, then DCA is definitely not a good strategy.  (more details on this topic [here](

Bitcoin itself is 'legit' - as in, it has value to many people around the world and enables you to do things you could not do before (be your own bank, decide who you bank with without anyone interfering in the exchange etc...)
Of course, just as dollars or gold, it can be used for 'illicit' purposes and there are many scams going on. So whatever you decide to do with it, always
* triple check the information, preferably from completely different sources (note - 2 people saying the same on this sub is NOT a different source ;) )
* read the wiki, FAQ and other resources from the sidebar
* NEVER ever give anyone your private keys and NEVER use any online service requiring your private keys - you WILL get scammed

What exactly are they joining? I personally think the ecosystem does not need more scared hodlers, it needs people who actually use the currency. I do provide some stats and like the math around investing, but I stopped convincing people on why they should be in Bitcoin. In personal life I interact mostly with people who are already in or ask "when", and skip all those asking "why", because it just drains me.
Now, for all those who see this as an investment without any interest in the underlying asset, they should do the same research they would do for SPY puts before a meaty round of earning calls or whatever  they are about to do. If someone is discouraged because it is hard or time consuming, they should not be investing in the first place (AMZN or BTC, no matter what). These people will never be happy no matter what happens IMO.

Everything is Xtimes more expensive in Venezuela... considering the situation there, prices go up not only in local currency but also in USD.
I also suppose large chunk of the premium is a "commission" to clear customs.
Anyway, as long as the running cost (electricity) is 0 and the miners do not break down, he will eventually break even so the risk is fine. Also, intrinsic value of BTC is much higher in Venezuela, so future gains cannot be overstated (and you do not rely on exchanges if you mine, so it is also a good thing)

BTC on its base layer is just money. There is no consumer protection built into the dollar or euro either.  The protection comes from what's built on top of the currency - institutions such as banks, payment processors etc. 
Same goes to BTC, for now, these institutions are limited to escrow services, but there are many others in the works. Projects such as [debnk.io]( aim to bring more utility in, while still operating in a trust-less and decentralized system.

If you feel it is shady, then it probably is.
Getting an investment advisor is fine, but the 1st thing to do is to verify their position - do they have skin in the game? If the answer is no, do not continue the discussion. If they are invested as well, check the size of the position - if it is too small for what you do, do not proceed. If it is too big, also proceed with caution (they may be more open to risk).
Basically, never take advice from anyone who has a cut of your gains, but does not take any loss when you do.

Compared to what though? Bitcoin blockchain looks fine when stacked up against Ethereum - not only in its size, but also the bandwidth it consumes (mine is at around 15GB/month, you can fine tune this to your liking). Of course, many shitcoins will have lower requirements, but that is just because no one is actually using them.  
Just to illustrate - if you download GTA 5 (72GB) and Doom (55GB) on steam, you have half of your full node already. Watch a few movies on Netflix (3GB/hour  or Youtube (1.5GB/hour  , add some general browsing to the mix and you are at your full node already.

This is an unpopular opinion on this sub, but DCA is really not a good investment strategy \*in general\*. In this (an almost other crypto sub) it gets recommended a lot, but bear in mind that 99 out of 100 people recommending it are never put to the test with an actual decision of lump sum investing vs DCA. They stack sats month to month, payday to payday while never holding any substantial cash position in the process (anecdotally, you could say they do a lump sum investment of all the cash they have, just more frequently :) ). You actually have a lump sum to work with, so do not base your research just on recommendations from here (me included ;) ).
Now, for some details and open questions to help you with your decision (mostly referencing quite often cited paper by Vanguard [  , or this study  [  )
* Lump sum investment will outperform DCA majority of the time.  When investing in markets with upwards tendency, getting in early yields more gain. (Note that almost all studies are based on index funds/stock market and similar, and these had upward tendency since they existed. Do you consider Bitcoin to have this tendency?)
* If there is a downwards tendency on the market, why would you even invest? What are your motivations?
* Are you more concerned about average outcome or worst case scenario? DCA \*may\* be of use if your goal is to minimize downside risk (buying in at the bubble). People usually do not invest to minimize downside risk, but your mileage and motivation may vary.
* What is your investment horizon?Long or short term?  For long term ("hodl to the moon"), lump sum will outperform most of the strategies you can come up with.  For short term, DCA may be of use again. Imagine you had a decision to make in 2013 (not knowing the future).  If you did lump sum for long term, you would be more than golden and happy by now.  If you planned to invest for 2-3 years and cash out, DCA would cut your loses (and maybe turn profit).  Bubble from 2 years ago is no different. If you priced in at 20k for long term, you do not care about actual price now. Of course, this can be nerve wracking, but so can be holding free floating cash (fear of not getting in). Again, depends on your personal feeling and risk appetite.

If you have a lump sum to invest, statistically you are [better off by just one-shotting it]( (shameless plug to an article of mine).
If you do not have a lump sum to invest and are talking about a monthly allowance from your salary or other regular source of income, then just buy once the money hits your account. It is more practical, and dividing the allowance even further will not have an effect in the long run.
There are exchanges which offer recurrent buy orders (coinbase, gemini..), but if you use this option you pay more on the fees, and all Bitcoin you buy will remain on the exchange in their hot wallet.  You may save some time on the order, but you will have to log in to transfer Bitcoin to your own wallet anyway.

Yes, but CZ has problem with any currency, not specifically crypto. As I understand it, they ban wage payments in USD, EUR or anything else that is not CZK which really does not make sense, as CZ is part of EU, so I suppose there are many foreigners working locally, who would prefer being paid in EUR because that's what they need home. 
As others stated, this ban is not even the case of NZ - the article is simply wrong.  They did not "allow" crypto -   
what they agreed on, is that payment of wage in crypto is taxable on the same level as any other wage, and to make it simpler, they require the salary to be pegged to NZD (ie, the contract has to state that you get 10k NZD a month, paid in crypto of choice, instead of saying you get 1BTC every month).

If you do not want to wait, you can still use electrum with your old wallet. If your plan is to cash out, there is no need to sync and store the entire blockchain and mempool just to do that.
You need to do a keydump from bitcoin core wallet (either on command line or from bitcoin-qt), and import those in another wallet of your choice. You do not actually import wallet.dat, but its un-encrypted content, which is your private key. 
Additionally, once you have the private key, you may decide to use electrum's "sweep" functionality instead of importing your old wallet. This will give you a new address, and transfer coins from your old one to the new one.  
Detailed information on the process can be found here -  [  , just be aware of the fact, that once you do the keydump, anyone with access to that file can steal all your coins. If you are cashing out, this should not be an issue because your balance will be 0 at the end of your process anyway.   Just do not reuse the wallet in the future, and if you decide to get in again, get a hardware wallet from your gains ;)

My point is, you can't just ignore the costs even if you wish to do so. 
Btw, in Germany and a few more countries you are taxed on the electricity you produce and consume locally, which makes the running cost more than 0. In some other EU countries, local consumption is illegal and you must feed the electricity back to the grid (for which you get a compensation in a form of feed-in tarrif) and then you buy it back for regular price. Also germany is a shitty location (3 sun hours a day as long term average or so?)
There is a reason why there is no serious mining operation anywhere in western europe, and energy cost is precisely one of those. Heck, I wonder if there will be any heavy industry left in Germany considering the decisions local government makes, since most of it is based on emotions, with no hard facts supporting those decisions. I am waiting for campaigns like "kill bitcoin miner, save a kid/tree/planet soon(tm)"

That would be the \*theoretical\* application of quantum computing. In reality, it is physically not possible to build computer that is able to do the factorization, and so far there is not even a theoretical proof that it would be feasible.
For a "simple" prime factorization, your quantum computer would need to handle more states than there are neutrons in known universe. With today's technology, you need a big-ass factory to handle just one single state (and that is made out of a lot of those neutrons ;)

There is no such thing as "for free". You absolutely HAVE to take fixed costs into account, and you will have variable costs on top of those as well (maintenance...). In the case you describe not only would the fixed entry cost be quite high, but specifically with solar energy there is no possibility to use your investment most of the day and it would just collect dust.  Just to illustrate... yes, you can buy an electric car for 90k and drive for "free" from superchargers, but you could also buy a $30k equivalent car and use the remaining $60k to buy gas for the rest of your life. Maybe you could even invest the $60k and buy the gas from earned interest... Will the electric car last a lifetime? (exact numbers may vary, but you get the point - always take into account fixed costs as well as opportunity costs)
Now, back to mining - all serious miners are actually located precisely in regions that are very close to cheap electricity - near big dams, shores, chinese coal plants etc. Or alternatively, in regions with great conditions for efficient cooling (which accounts pretty much for half of your costs once you go big).  Optimally, you have a combination of both.
(small edit to put the solar into more perspective - you will need around 20m2 or 200sqft of solar panels to power one Antminer s17, assuming it will be able to cool itself with the built in fan. System like this would cost maybe $5k to buy, not counting installation and maintenance.  Now, assuming you have a residential price on electricity of $0.12/kWh , for $5000 you could run the Antminer nonstop for 2 years and a few weeks nonstop, which you can't do with that panel because well, the sun sets. Now imagine you get a deal in china for $0.04/kWh because you are close to a dam and also have big coal mine nearby... because that's what bitmain &amp; co does)

Trezor HW wallet now makes this a bit easier after they implemented Shamir backup.  You can split your recovery key into many pieces, and configure how many of them are needed to actually produce an usable output (3 pieces out of 5 for example). More detail is provided on their blog  [  
Fun fact - the method is recursive in a true Xzibit fashion - so you can have keys in your keys while you do keys :D  Just don't overdo it, having to call 30 out of 50 people to just get one piece out of 5 of the master key is just silly and probably stupid.

Well, even if they plan to hodl, they should move the coins asap on reception (since OP knows private keys because he had to print those papers in the 1st place), and today it would cost you around $1 to move that $10 so it is impractical even with today's low fees, not counting mixers.
I do not think Doge will be here in 30 years, but still.. BTC is shit for giving out $10 in crypto. If you do not like memes but still want to spread awareness of crypto, use LTC or ETH instead of Doge... if the recipient wants btc, he can still trade it.

You will be fine with Trezor or Ledger, with your seed backed up in a proper way. The hassle of setting up real cold storage and all procedures surrounding it is simply not worth it for most people. In many cases, trying to replicate what these dudes or exchanges do for their main wallets will be even less secure, because you really have to think about how do you print/etch/store/use the thing, who do you give keys to, what device will you use to sign transactions? (not to mention address reuse issues because ppl are lazy to generate new ones with these setups often).
They do not trust it, because they store way bigger amounts than you do, and those amounts require different procedures.
Also - NEVER buy a pre-made cold storage wallet (like those metal rings inside glass that you have to break to get to the private key). Buying them as decoration is fine, but they are completely unsecured as actual wallet. No matter what the seller claims about security of the private key, or how they have XYZ certifications guaranteeing the keys are really secure and they do not know them, do not listen - they DO know them, because otherwise it would be impossible to create the thing in the 1st place. They WILL steal your Bitcoin once you stash some in the wallet they made. If the seller does not steal directly, someone who hacked his PC will \^\^;

"Community" does not want or care, what regulated institutions do.  These institutions on the other hand, realized it is their last moment to jump on the crypto bandwagon, so they do it not because they want it, but because they had to.. (first they laughed, then they banned us and now....)

No idea what you are on about. Nowhere in my sentence do I mention 2FA, or even defense against minorities... hell, why would I care what color is someone who tries to steal my stuff.
" But don't tell me that there is any country any country at all where the citizenry is allowed to self-defend. " - Country I live in currently has "self defense" as the 1st and most used choice when getting your firearms licence... Criminal law has a paragraph that specifically states that "any action that would constitute a crime is not one, if it was committed in self defense". So please, tell me, how am I not allowed to defend myself?
Now go back to norway - Firearm permit is issued for Sports or Hunting, self defense option is impossible, unless you are LEO. Also, good luck getting a CC permit (in here we have automatic and mandatory conceal carry)... Not to mention that all the few remaining semi autos in the country will be banned from 2021.

Is this exchange rate even relevant? I doubt there is anyone actually buying BTC with Peso (which is as good as monopoly money now). And since you most probably just use USD to buy crypto anyway, you will pay the same rate as anyone on the market.

I don't think you can compare the "big" picture of government monopoly on violence to personal ability to defend ones property. For the latter, laws are enough - and I think (and recommend) everyone should prefer places that allow you more individual freedoms to places that restrict them. Norway and other Scandinavian countries are one of the most restrictive places in the EU not only when it comes to firearms, but also other individual freedoms (seriously, come to Norway and try to pay 500e cash for 5 bottles of Champaigne in a grocery store, chance is they will call police on you - either for the booze, and if not, then for the suspicious cash transaction).
The 1st part (be really free and do not ask government for permission) is only possible if there is no state and no monopoly on force, and currently that is just an utopia. Even the most hardcore crypto anarchists I know came to realize that will not happen, and that is why they stopped trying to fight the state, but instead they create parralel societies, use decentralized tools and pretty much opt out of state activities and minimize interactions as much as possible.

Since the whole thing is non custodial, you could just export xpubs and use a publically hosted one if you do not have ressources to do it yourself, or chip on with someone who wants to process payments as well and split costs.

Fake story, but good idea for a fiction novel or something.
