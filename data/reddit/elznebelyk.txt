 You can have cash sent to you through the mail on OpenBazaar, no ID, no corporate fees/taxes, seems pretty simple to me: [Cash mailed to you for Bitcoin](

Next block (mb) size must be +/- 75% of previous block size.
After 5 blocks in a row are 95% full, increase max block size by 5%.
Miners could still slowly reduce the number of TX's but you said there was no other way.

Not true, there are people that want to buy stuff on Amazon for Bitcoin believe it or not. E.g. a lot of people earn "Amazon Credit" only good on Amazon.com sites, so they would love Bitcoin even at a 25% markup.

I can sell (micro) BTC, send me pm with your address and how you wanna pay.

Yes, that is what tmorini put so simply and eloquently for you. All the goddamn communities are very similar, all the idiots think they are special. And there is one of you idiot savants asking, why is it that we are the chosen, out of so many, what is it that makes us special?

I keep talking to people about it, but now try to bring it up almost jokingly, like, "sure I'll pay you back, in bitcoins". This worked one time when I used it to break into a conversation with a gentleman working for IBM in their IoT division, specifically how to integrate crypto into their program. I know very little, but was blown away by his lack of knowledge, he was right in the middle of IBM development, and somehow knew all the right words, but didn't use them correctly, e.g. "we want to use blockchain tech. to be able to sell as a service home appliance, so you pay per wash cycle, or pay per degree heated or cooled..." but he had no concept of how or why bitcoin was still necessary for this scheme and though bitcoin itself was probably a scam! Tl,Dr: keep talking to people but don't be surprised that 99% are idiots.

No, it makes no sense, they basically run a null node on a server.

It actually just takes an economically minded individual, so, basically anyone with a brain should act exactly in this way. But yeh, I agree, humans are assholes.

**awsedrr**, seriously, please read the memos before posting, did we not just had a memo about this. Now, good Sir, the reason for the massive $15 price swing we are currently experiencing is likely the result of the interaction between billions of independent human minds acting in their own self interest and an infinite number of economic indicators acting as both positive and negative feedback on themselves.

RBF is just double spending made easy, now any user can "replace" a payment with a new one. This update makes unconfirmed transactions impossible to accept. Goodby my favortive killer bitcoin app, fold app for buying coffee :(

That is a very funny idea that obviously could never work, but I'll keep an eye on that address to see how close (or more likely ridiculously far) you come from reaching your 50 btc goal. RemindMe! 2 Months

I think you are right on the money bother. Now, how to use this information to extort/help destroy Shkreli...

No, I don't think the technical discussion (bickering) can stop now. As long as bitcoin exists this type of disagreement (bickering) will be a normal and healthy part of the system.  2MB vs. 1 MB vs. allowing transactions to be reversed etc... are big decisions and hopefully there will be many failures and successes along the way, or you know, bickering. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:52:45
Yeh, double spending made easy! (AKA RBF)
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:44:42
Right here, just pm me your address and how your gonna get me the $3 and I'll send you the coin.

Bail in!!! Its official, Gemini is bailing in by taking money out of the accounts of users that made trades, they just "rolled back" $1,000 + out of my account!!!
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:03:50
Happened to me. I got an e-mail yesterday saying my limit orders had been met, $450, $550, $1000. So I jumped on the site to see what happened. Price had already dropped back down, so I bought back into BTC ASAP so I could withdraw. The buy went through, so I was back in BTC, then the site went offline. This morning I look and my account it back to the original BTC value before either trade! They literally "rolled back" $1000 + out of my account! Dirty bastards!

Yep, either way is interesting/funny. Does he (1) think that he could get people to send him some BTC to "help get theirs back" from a defunct exchange, or (2) have some fake/shitty lawyer telling him to go on-line to find more clients for him and "Mr. Death" here is actually doing it for him. *Kids on the internet :)*

(1) You have BTC, (2) you want to invest it, (3) you don't want to convert: BTC --&gt; $ --&gt; investment, then investment --&gt; $ --&gt; BTC
