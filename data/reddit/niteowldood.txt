Long time email admin here. Doesn't look fake, but the part about wy3.waste4energy.com looks suspicious. I would try and contact someone (postmaster maybe)? in their IT dept. They should be able to verify if it was sent from their server or not, but from my view, it definitely was, however, it could have been someone hacked their network as well.  Good luck. :|

@_date: 2016-04-21 18:36:02
Ok. Keep trying. Check this out - I'm convinced that was absolutely sent through their server, or if not, it was a very clever hack and someone had full control of your machine because there is no way to fake those headers that well, unless someone hacked their network and sent it - The software version matches the headers :

Maybe so, regarding the elitist comment, however, the, main idea of this thread is the OP wants to use bitcoin for everything, meaning, instead of cash, thus he wants to close his coinbase account for converting his BTC into USD.

Does it really matter? To be fair, this is really a discussion about how to safely store BTC for the long run, without depending on any specific vendor's software - Let's not let the guys' "Legal" situation taint the ideas here, I mean hell, he could of not even mentioned that part. I know I probably wouldn't have, especially since my/his/her past posting history is clear as day to all. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:02:58
I've only seen one post about it here on and it' was from a user who had never set a pin, and this was quite some time ago. i do recall it was a fair amount, as i think it was worth more at the time. I remember everyone going DUDE, why would you keep 18K USD in btc on a phone overnight?  his answer for a large purchase the next day... other than that, i love mycelium, especially since they updated to HD.

sorry man. you got that all wrong. He is not anonymous, he has a graduate degree in fact that is verifiable.  Plus, with the right snippets of info about him, you will clearly see he is in fact a real person, and not "hiding", but fortunately, i will not prove my point, as that's not cool on reddit. go do way way more homework. And read up about cypherpunks. that may get you where you want if you want to find "NS" ;)

This isn't really correct - Nick Szabo is indeed a real human, even if he lays pretty low, and I'm fairly sure he's not Satoshi either - in fact, if you have the proper leads and google foo, you can even find his past &amp; current home address on google maps.

The genesis block is not spendable by design. He mined at least a few hundred blocks after that (Probably many many more), &amp; all to different wallet addresses, as that is how the first bitcoin client worked at the time.

then if your all set with that, that's fine man. I've been running linux since like 1995 or whenever it was first stable as well, so i'm an old unix guy it's fine. 
point was, most people are scared of losing coins and aren't smart linux doods like us, so they need some more security that's not very difficult to understand. I have a trezor. it's pretty easy. my dad whose like 70 could use it, but then again, he's been on computers the past 10 years.
I completely understand you tho, as i'm old skool yo, but we have to face the now.

i have had one since last august. It's all good. no worries. i don't use it everyday but if you have at least a btc or 2 or 3, you should probably check it out if you are concerned about theft. it's worked flawlessly for me so far, and i do keep up on all the threads about it so i hear both sides equally. nothing is secure 100%, welcome to computing. lol.

I just posted about this recently - you could literally sweep the funds off any trezor into mycelium provided the trezor had no passphrase (i.e with no pin required) - They fixed that, now the pin is required at least. Good work Trezor guys! :)

Here's the paper - 
BTW - if you have a lot of time, you can pretty much find his exact location if you weed through the hundreds of archived emails - there is one in particular that gives it all up. ;)   
Lastly - NOT satoshi - Satoshi would not have his home on google maps, and findable via mail archives. ;)

Yes, monero can and does do it already, without any "Supernodes" that can spy on you like DRK. You cannot view wallet balances or track transactions by design. :)    Edit - Sorry but it's just too complicated to ELI5, read the cryptonote whitepaper.

You are actually in at a better point than a lot of us. I got into it in late 2014, right before mt. gox (no i didn't lose anything there). That said, a lot of people here have lost money over the past year, however, if your are hodling, who knows. we all hope the price rises, it's natural, but not necessarily critical at the moment if your are in for the long haul. Personally, when they get cheap, i don't get too worried, in fact, i just get greedier, and buy even more. ;)

"Your" obsession with BTC prevents you from seeking any other coins of interest out. For example, Monero/XMR may not have billions into it, but just like BTC was not built in a day or a year, neither will these other coins. I agree, nothing has replaced BTC yet, and maybe never will. My point is there are not just BTC-clones out there. Look harder, think longer, &amp; learn more daily. :)

Yes, it's absolutely legit, but I have no idea why. There may be a gox connection as well:   &amp;

Spending BTC with a trezor is not a difficult thing, and quite secure, more than my pc atm. Ask Joho the guy who returned like 200 btc's to coinbase after that last hack... Edit i agree about the seed, your wallet is basically swept after that and hence worthless imo.

Thanks, but my "job" is not to explain jack shit to you. READ, man, READ.... I was merely pointing one of many out that you haven't even heard of (obviously), and No, BTC will not be able to do the same things as Monero anytime soon, so sorry to bust your BTC bubble. Again, read, it helps you look not so stupid in the long run, and it's free even! :D
