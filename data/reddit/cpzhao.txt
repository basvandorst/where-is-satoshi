And it is completely ok to have transactions based on previous unconfirmed inputs, just these transactions won't be confirmed either until the previous ones are.  Bitcoin protocol allows this.  There is no false data being presented by Blockchain.  You just need to understand unconfirmed transaction means unconfirmed transactions.  No?

Thanks for pointing this out.  Constructive and informative feedback like this is much needed.

Thanks for all the comments and feedback.  Sounds like we got to:
Add more currencies, NZD, AU, TWD, etc.  We will add all major currencies shortly.
As for open source, the app is still under very active development.  There are a couple really neat features coming up, and we don't want to spoil the fun. 
The Merchant App does not need any private info from the Merchant, only their PUBLIC receiving address.  So, there are no security concerns.
We will most certainly open-source some of the libraries we made during this app soon, to make it easier for other developers to use the Blockchain services on Android.
The best way to see the source code is to join the Blockchain Team.  We are always recruiting top talent and true bitcoiners.  If that sounds like you,  contact me.  We have tons of interesting work ahead of us.
Is the coinbase merchant app open-source by any chance?  I wouldn't mind taking a peek if it is.

a more aggressive rebroadcast mechanism.

It's added

Thanks for speaking out.
We still have a lot of work to do and many improvements to make.  Fixing the network connectivity that some users are experiencing is the top priority at the moment.

thank you!

Not all (Chinese) exchanges are the same.  Due to Huobi's problems, OKCoin got a lot praises.  When MtGox went down, it does not mean BitStamp was bad as well.  The market will filter out the long term solid exchanges.

The previous certificate was QKOS, owned personally by a person.  We are in the process of migrating this to a company certificate.  The process has taken longer than expected and the QKOS cert expired.  That's all!

Re: license.  GNU or Apache?  Which one is better?  What's the difference?

NZD and 14 other currencies have been added!

Thank you for this.  We are working on it!  Sorry about that "near death" experience!

DeftNerd, 
How does Blockchain (the company) has any control over whether miners broadcast your transactions or not?
An unconfirmed transaction means Blockchain has already posted to the bitcoin network.  From there, miners can confirm it or not.  Miners usually prioritize over transactions with higher fees, obviously.
Learn about how bitcoins work before blaming a company, thats providing a valuable service in the industry, all for FREE.

Don't worry, I don't think Blockchain will swallow the 0.038 btc.  They are super busy with a small team.  It will get fixed.  Sorry about the annoyance factor.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:22:31
Thanks for being part of the solution!  Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:20:39
We started the upgrade a little bit later than expected, and it's taking a little bit longer than expected.  Still working on it.  Please bear with us.  Thanks,
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:03:29
Good point...

This is CZ from OKCoin.  
On the topic of volume, I suggest you do a simple test.  Buy 10, 100, or 1000 BTC (or whatever size that suits you) on OKCoin, and any other exchange you like, see how the price moves, what slippage you get.  Then you will know where the real volume is.
On the topic of revenue, don't worry about our business.  Let us worry about that.  Google and Facebook did everything for free for the first 5-10 years.  Yet, they are very valuable companies, and are now strong revenue generators.
OKCoin.cn has no trading fees, but we do have a very small withdraw fee.  The margin service has interest earnings.  OKCoin.com does have trading fees, although one of the lowest in the industry.  Our futures platform also have trading fees, and boosts nice volumes and growing nicely.
We have another interesting product coming up too, OKLink.com.
Lastly, OKCoin is an open trading platform.  We don't control how our users trade.  We also don't/can't change our data.  We just/must report whatever trading data is on our platform as is.

oops, it's the end time that matters. :)
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:49:27
EDIT: this is fixed now.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:20:09
What do you mean by false data being show?  Unconfirmed transactions means it is not confirmed or forwarded by miners, so naturally in other nodes or explorers will not see the transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:20:09
Yes, anyone can rebroadcast a transaction.

Regardless if she is right or wrong, she has caused so much trouble for this person.  She practically destroyed the guy's life, whether he is Satoshi or not.  Very irresponsible journalism.  Gonna ban Newsweek for a while.

OKCoin.com is clean.  Thanks for the advertising though.
