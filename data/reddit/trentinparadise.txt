Bitcoin won't fail now. Its long awaited off-chain payment layer is coming in the form of the lightning protocol and network. This will bring Bitcoin up to the level were it can compete with other Crypto-currencies. Excitement is building over Lightning and this is starting to renew and inspire confidence in Bitcoin again.

I second that motion
We ARE to blame.
There is NO excuse anymore. If you are not using a Segwit address by now, you are a bloody idiot.
1. You are cheating yourself by paying high fees 
2. Being part of the congestion problem
3. Not being a supportive member of this community
4. You are unlikely to spread the word about Segwit if you are not using it yourself
As a community project we are ALL responsible for Bitcoin marketing and communication. 
We should ALL be communicating this message to other Bitcoin users on all social media platforms.

It's a bad thing when it comes to Bitcoin or chains that claim they are Bitcoin.
We revere Bitcoin as being devoid of manipulation and that everything happens due to consensus.
Bitcoin core developers have long tried to keep consensus away from miners due to mining centralisation, because they have shown they can and will abuse that power. Bcash goes total control to miners, they determine the concensus
This is a big problem because Bcash is virtually under the control of a few super-rich and manipulative people that can raise the fees anytime they want and do what ever they want with Bcash.. All of those people now have mining operations, because to do so gives them the power, and power and money is all they want from Bcash. Calvin Ayre (criminal) now have one of the larger mining farms in the world, only mines BCH. Roger Ver (ex-con) has the Bitcoin.com mining pool. Jihan Wu and Haipo Yang have enormous mining operations and pools. John McAfee (accused of murder/rape in Belize) now has a mining operation. Craig Wright (fake Satoshi) also getting his mining operations going...in Iceland I believe. All are THE major promotors of Bcash, all now will have power to do whatever they want with BCH.
Most Bcash supporters know this, but don't care.. because its not about being Satoshi like anymore its about bringing Bcash up to scratch to battle Bitcoin and kill of the Bitcoin chain.

This is truly sickening.  This is the guy that helped initiate the BCH fork, was the first to put up BCH futures, helps pay the BitcoinABC lead developer and along with Jihan Wu actively supports and promotes BCH. In China these two are heavily promoting BCH as a future payment gateway for Chinese citizens .. They want to make BCH China's version of Bitcoin. And the BCH faithful in the west are all assisting them in that process by blindly supporting what is essentially the Chinese miners coin. Centralised mining using a coin they initiated! And the BCH boys say BCH is holding true to Satoshi's vision.. and BCH is the true Bitcoin. [cringe]
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:19:34
Hypothetically no, providing Lightning has widespread adoption. But right now if Coinbase batched transactions and adopted Segwit it would dramatically reduce fees and speed up transactions within a day. Coinbase knows exactly what they are doing.. they have a motive. They got away with it as long as they could, now they have to upgrade, but they will do it at a snails pace

@_date: 2018-01-10 19:26:47
I've spoken to many BCH supporters, I was one of them.. and most know what is going on but make excuses or turn a blind eye.
There is a lot of history to learn to properly understand this fraud. I'll keep it as short as possible :)
It really started back the days when Mike Hearn was a core developer and the Bitcoin XT client he was promoting in opposition to most of the other core developers. He didn't get support of course so he went public and thus created a rift in the development team and online in this subreddit. Then Bitcoin Classic was born and later Bitcoin Unlimited where the miners would be able to decide how big the blocks were. Satoshi said one CPU one vote and never imagined we would now have Chinese centralised mining that is a multi-million dollar a month business calling the shots.
These days the Chinese miners hold the majority of the hashing power for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin core developers see this as centralisation and tried to do what they can to avoid this becoming worse. 
viaBTC saw an opportunity with the core developer and Bitcoin community rift, took sides and teamed up an independent developer called Amaury Seuchet and the BitcoinABC client was born. So viaBTC used its power and helped initiate the Bcash fork. viaBTC set up a Bcash futures market and a fund to help the development of Bcash and essentially pay Amaury's huge pay check. ViaBTC's owner Haipo Yang (  ) also owns the coineX exchange where BCH is the base for all currency pairings. He also openly Schill's Bcash and calls it the real Bitcoin in order to align himself with the Bcash promotors in the west.
In the background, is another fellow in China called Jihan Wu (Bitmain/Antpool) he is particularly crafty and extremely wealthy and holds the majority of the Bitcoin hashing power. He provided much of the initial support and funding to viaBTC. Jihan basically has a bet each way on Bcash and Bitcoin but is behind much of the Bcash promotion and support in China through his online newspaper and his shadow support of viaBTC. 
BTW: Bitmain, manufactures the ASIC chips that are the heart of their Antminer mining rigs that are sold worldwide (only if you pay in Bcash) these rigs are used in Bitmains mining operations - Antpool and other pools in China like viaBTC and also pools overseas.
So the Chinese mining cartel starts with manufacturing the mining hardware, controlling the hashing power, supporting their coin of choice, the one that gives them the most profit. Then moves onto to the initiation of a UAHF Bcash, the financial support of the Bcash client, the collusion with the motley crew of high profile super-rich Bcash promoters in the west - Craig Wright, Calvin Arye, John McAfee and Roger Ver and his Bitcoin.com mining pool. Next is the Bcash promotion within the Chinese online newspaper  and the Bcash pairing ONLY exchange  
So the Chinese have got a complete and stable monopoly with Bcash, the creation of which has been cleverly and carefully executed.
This is NOT part of Satoshi's vision, it is NOT Bitcoin and yet Bcash tries to promote itself as being the 'real' Bitcoin. And I haven't even mentioned how Bcash's price is manipulated and kept stable around $2,400, how Roger Ver has everything to gain from promoting Bcash as the real Bitcoin.. because he owns the Bitcoin.com website and other Bitcoin branded entities. And the main thing I hate is Bcash's promoters in the west main aim is to undermine Bitcoin, slowly steal its brand and ultimately try to kill off Bitcoin at the right time along with the help of the Chinese miners.

Based on my own research, Satoshi is actually a group made of up two Australians and one American.  One of them is Craig Wright, he was the system integrator, the problem solver and main programmer. Another one (I shouldn't mention his name) assisted Craig with programming and other duties. Dave Kleiman, an American, assisted Craig with much of the correspondence between the early adopters on mailing lists and forums. That was up until April 2010 when he was hospitalised. Craig and another took over from there until 2011.

Yes, happy to help! At the moment Binance and Coinbase don't have Segwit enabled..it's on their roadmap though. So there is not a lot you can do right now, but it all starts with awareness :) HitBTC is an exchange that I use regularly and it does have Segwit enabled. When I transfer Bitcoin to HitBTC I do so through a hardware wallet called a Ledger Nano s and this has Segwit enabled also. I have saved a lot in fees by using a Segwit wallet and dealing with exchanges that offer Segwit also.
Later on when you get the hang of things and decide to invest more and more it would be a good idea to invest in a hardware wallet like the nano s as its a very safe and secure way to store your Bitcoin.  If you get one that has Segwit enabled then your half way there, all you need then it to choose an exchange which has Segwit enabled and you can start enjoying lower fees and you'll be helping to reduce the network congestion at the same time. :)  
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:15:22
No argument .. since the original vision was to avoid trustless third parties to process transactions. Which means almost every Bitcoin based crypto continues Satoshi's so-called Vision. Bcash is a malicious fork that has no ethics. Chinese miners practically initiated Bcash, they mine it, promote it and fund its development.. Bcash is the ONLY coin that colludes with Chinese centralised mining and it has the gaul to promote itself as adhering to Satoshi's vision!

Lightning will reduce on-chain congestion which in turns reduces on-chain fees and improves transaction times.
Lighting is really designed for retail transactions and other use cases where instantaneous confirmation times are required.
This is why BCH is very concerned about Lightning and it trying to create FUD around it, Lightning theatres there retail market adoption drive..

Bitcoin is essentially fine, the fundamentals have not changed.  What changed was the scaling debate delayed Segwit and ultimately the lightning network. During this time Bitcoin popularity increased dramatically and the blocks were consistently full from Q2 2017. So Bitcoin was caught with its pants down. Now things are improving, Segwit adoption is improving the LN is looking good so in a few months you can expect Bitcoin fees to quite low and transactions times very fast.

He didn't create it from scratch, if anything he was the systems integrator. All of the components were there already in the public domain. Different communication styles because most of the posts were not him, they were probably DK. 4 people in the group originally, only 2 remain. Once he started collaborating with BCH he decided to set himself up as a hoaxer to take the heat off so the reveal could become more strategic later on so it could assist BCH in crushing BTC at the right time. Or if my info is all incorrect he is one of the most brilliant fraudsters of all time, he has even fooled his entire family from the Laimers to the Edwards. But you are right, he is a social engineer. This could all be a long con, Bitcoin was designed to make him and the others money..nothing grassroots or noble about it. It was originally a crypto for online gambling, then adapted when its full potential was understood. Thats just one theory.. the truth? Who knows
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:24:23
My opinion is cryptocurrency should NEVER have its price manipulated or regulated, the price should be what it is due to organic market forces.  Once we start regulating it we have something that is no better or worse than the FIAT currencies we currently have.

I think that is a fair assessment.  The FIAT to BTC gateways/exchanges that have not enabled Segwit thus far are, in effect causing much of the congestion and high fees.  We need to lobby these exchanges to be pro-Segwit. It doesn't take a lot of coding to enable an exchange for Segwit, so whats the problem? Ideology - pro big blocks, or lack of technical expertise?
COINBASE could make a huge impact on the mempool IF it enabled Segwit. But Armstrong and Co have been big block supporters since the Hearn XT days. I suspect they are dragging their feet just to stick another knife in Bitcoins back.

Back at the start the block size increase was being forced on the developers by Mike Hearn. Consensus didn't matter to Mike he wanted what he wanted. He was pushing his own client XT (with lighthouse support I should add) then Gavin got on board.
The core developers could see what was happening, Mike and Gavin were trying to implement their own client and get rid of the core developers at the same time.  Lets not blame the developers. They were and are good programmers, but politics and economics is not their forte. The huge gaps within the open-source platform itself is problematic for a project such as Bitcoin. But it was the lack of leadership from Gavin and the undermining actions of both Mike and Gavin that started this BS in the first place. Many of the developers were pro-big blocks and one wanted even smaller than 1 MB blocks. But in the end the developers consensus was Segwit and lightning was the immediate scaling solution.

Silly? Thats a strange term to use, may I where were you when all of this played out?
Yes, I know Mike and Gavin were there right at the start, everyone knows that, that is not the issue. 
Heard of consensus? Mike couldn't get consensus for his XT client within the core team so he went to the miners, they rejected it because of the 20MB block size maximum. Mike went to the forums to get social consensus and to create a movement. Gavin meanwhile was siding with Mike and as the leader effectively undermined the team and allowed Mike to go on his rampage. Consensus rules dictate almost everyone has to agree, so if you can't get the core team to agree you will never have consensus. 
There is a lot more history to this but Mike and Gavin were the ring leaders that fractured the core dev team.
Playing with god? Ridiculous.
We are NOT where we are now because of the core developers. Segwit implementation was not delayed by the core developers.. I think you need to go back and read the forum archives and learn a bit more about the FACTs

I wish it would. It would be a fast way to dissolve the Chinese mining cartels grip. Centralised mining in China by the Bitmain and viaBTC monopoly has and will continue to be a thorn in BTC's backside. They initiated the BCH fork, pay the lead developer, support and promote it with a BCH paired only exchange... and of course they mine the coin. BCH really is a product of the Chinese mining cartel and they and their loyal blindfolded followers promote this shitcoin as the real Bitcoin and waffle on about how decentralised and true to Satoshi it is... how far from the truth can they get!
Got to be one of the biggest and most greediest monopolies in this industry. And check out this shit from viaBTC - Haipo Yang.. how centralised can mining get when one of the most influential miners in China actively promotes the coin they mine and calls it the real Bitcoin in twitter..      Truly sickening

It's not the supporters per se, but the promotors/backers and their lack of ethics in general and manipulative and misleading anti-BTC campaign. Bcash was initiated by the Chinese mining cartel that is Bitmain, viaBTC and others. They fund its development, promotion and mine the coin! That's called mining centralisation. Bcash supporters know this but turn a blind eye. The backers/promoters continue to promote Bcash as following 'Satoshis vision' which is nonsense and pure propaganda/marketing.

2. BCH fork was initiated by Haipo Yang and Jihan Wu
3. Ver, Wu, Yang and others fund the development of the Bitcoin ABC client
4. Wu sinks 3 million into Haipo Yangs exchange (CoinEX) where BCH is the paired coin to all other currencies
5. Now BCH is being HEAVILY marketed in China as THE Bitcoin and there is a huge movement building behind it. If and when the China government allow Cryptos to flourish again ChinaCoin will no doubt become THE Chinese currency coin of choice.
Bitmain and its associated companies and mining pools now have a complete BCH and mining monopoly..
1. They make the ASIC chips
2. Build the Antminers and sell them ONLY if you pay in BCH.
3. They help initiate the BCH fork - (get the big blocks they always wanted and no Segwit)
4. They help support the BitcojnABC client development - essentially help pay Amaury's HUGE paycheck
5. Actively work away in the background, manipulating and scheming with Ver, Ayre, McAfee and Wright
6. Now free to use ASICboost - and further increase Bitmains mining monopoly
7. Bitmain and associated mining operations mine BCH the coin they initiated!! - and BTC when it suits
8. They use their own Chinese propaganda website to shill BCH and their own products
9. Fund an exchange where BCH is the only coin paired to others
10. Next stop.. BCH is forked by them and used as a payment method in China? Becomes BitRMB..who knows.
One thing is for sure BCH is NOT aligned with Satoshi's Vision.. with the Gigablock network and the Chinese mining right behind it, BCH will have centralised nodes..courtesy of nChain and centralised mining..courtesy of Bitmain/Antpool/viaBTC.  BCH is the central element of Bitmains monopoly and he has cleverly managed to hoodwink the big block grassroots movement into thinking it's THEIR coin. For without their support his plans would not eventuate.

So like many brilliant people he has some SERIOUS personality issues. Yes is he is a liar, very much so!  But based on the evidence (that I have documented) he is either Satoshi and has a serious personality disorder OR Satoshi is dead and he knows that and his mental disorder is far more serious than first thought.

If Satoshi is Nick then it appears the current path the core developers are on with Segwit and Lightning is totally inline with Satoshi's vision. Nick is very much in favour of Lightning and thinks the BCH 'solution' is centralised garbage.

I think Elizabeth has made a bad decision here. Taking her objection to a public forum is only going to create division.  Better to direct her outburst directly to Blockstream through a more private channel. Is this supposed to become her public disclaimer if someone looses money at the Blockstream store?  Blockstream have gone to great lengths to warn people this is a test and you can loose money. You can do all the testing in the world on the testnet, but at some point real world testing needs to happen on the mainet.  I see nothing wrong with what Blockstream have done, they have provided warnings and people participate at their own risk.

Yes, Satoshi did say that at the right time, when needed, the block size could be increased.
However, he did not envisage how much the Bitcoin landscape would change in the future.
Satoshi left the project and handed the reigns over to the core developers to take control of Bitcoins future. 
The core developers were concerned about mining centralisation in China and the ever increasing blockchain size and how that WILL in the future effect the centralisation of nodes. Satoshi's vision is de-centralisation and the processing of transactions without the need of a trusted third party.
Now, what happens when you have centralisation? Control is given to the few.
This is EXACTLY the case with Bitcoin Cash.
The Chinese miners initiated the BCH fork and put forward the BitcoinABC client.
They now fund the lead developer of BitcoinABC. They promote BCH with the help of some charismatic and super-rich individuals of VERY dubious character.  They mine BCH and even provide mining equipment, but only if you pay in BCH. They established their own exchange where BCH fees are subsidised and the only pairing is BCH.  They have even forked BCH into Bitcoin Candy, god only knows what devious plan they have for that! To top it off the super-rich individuals I mentioned, they too now have their own mining operations.
There is something VERY wrong when a small group of miners can initiate their own coin, mine it, sell equipment to mine it, start their own exchange to trade the coin and then fork their own coin. It's not only monopoly creation but centralisation in every meaning of the word.  Everything Satoshi would be very much against.. and yet they claim they are following Satoshi's vision [cringe]
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:29:01
I applaud your suggestions and efforts. Right now Coinbase could reduce congestion (lower fees/fast tx times) by batching transactions and deploying Segwit. They haven't up till now because their ideology is aligned with what i call the 'Silicon Valley big block boys'  They, the co-founders, have always been on the side of the big blockers, started with XT now its BCH. BCH is getting a lot of help from various Bitcoin based companies that are big blockers, Coinbase is just one of the many. 
Coinbase now say they will deploy Segwit and batching, but you can bet they will drag their heals for as long as they can.

Just one thing.. you mentioned the BCH price. IMO its always best to forget price and focus on the Satoshi's. Based on the Satoshi's BCH has been loosing since the last big pump 4 weeks ago. Whilst Bitcoin has been increasing in value BCH has not followed suit. There are two reasons why this has happened, people have sold off BCH to invest back into BTC, or/and the price is being manipulated through pump and bleeding to purposely maintain the price range. BCH base camp did engage in this type of market manipulation in mid November and also during the August fork, so I wouldn't be surprised if they are doing the same again to install an image of price stability to potential new adopters.

Most of them weren't apposed to an increase to the block size. They were concerned about having to fork the chain to do so and had reservations about node centralisation. However they found another way which didn't require a risky hard-fork. Segwit 'effectively' increased the block size, albeit by a small margin. But Segwit also made it possible to add extra utility to bitcoin and now we have the lightning network which is going through the final testing phase. LN will 'take the load off' Bitcoin and provide faster transactions with lower fees.

It's not vapourware and the concept is good, very good.
Don't quite understand your analogy with a credit card, sorry it doesn't seem to fit.
Why not visit lightning labs and read the white paper.. should help you understand the concepts.
Yes, increasing the block size to 8MB seems straight forward, but the devil is in the detail.. hard forks for Bitcoin are bloody risky. It happened once (Mike Hearn initiated it) and it was very close to becoming a full on disaster. Its easy and safe for other coins to just increase the block size when they fork but for Bitcoin it's very problematic to do so at this stage. I think they will increase the block size max, but it wont be anytime soon

Bitcoin is still digital cash, nothing has changed.
I use it as digital cash, I pay all my bills, mortgage and day to day expenses with Bitcoin.
I send family and friends Bitcoin P2P and pay a very small fee by dialling up the fee based on the required level of priority.
I have no issues at all using Bitcoin exactly as Satoshi intended.
Sure we all know about the recent high fees and the slow transaction times, but that is now receding and with the LN Bitcoin is about to get a lot faster and cheaper, so I see no reason to complain when there is a lot to be positive about right now.

BCH is the ultimate Chinese designer knock-off coin.
Gotta give it to him, Jihan Wu is a genius.
BCH/BU originally initiated by Bitmain/viaBTC.  Its development paid for by Bitmain/viaBTC and others.  Promotion and support paid for by Bitmain/viaBTC and others
What a scam!
We in the west have been taken for a ride.
1. Bitmain makes the ASIC chips
2. Builds the Antminers
3. Sells them to anyone that will pay in BCH
4. Deploys them in his own mining operations and his shadow ops
5. Steals the ASICboost tech
6. Initates a fork that is ASICboost friendly and has big blocks
7. Invests millions into an exchange where BCH is paired with other cryptos
8. Conspires to manipulate the market
What a monopoly!

Binance.. but it's not Australian
Sign up is super quick and easy, no jumping through hoops. Platform is intuitive and they have plenty of coins. No AUD to BTC though, you need to exchange your AUD for BTC via coinbase or elsewhere
Australia has coinspot, but it's not an exchange per se and you get trapped within its platform because the coins are priced up higher than elsewhere. But its great for beginners and you can exchange AUD for BTC/LTC but no charting and no deposits allowed of anything but BTC/LTC

Bitcoin will only die if we, the Bitcoin community, the users  allow it to happen.

Upvoted - good question.
With the current level of adoption and with mainstream adoption on our doorstep big blocks are a terrible way to scale.
I'll put it simply: Every transaction that ever was is recorded within the blockchain, if I downloaded the blockchain onto my PC today it would be around 2GB which doesn't sound like a lot but we must constrain this as much as possible as going forward it will become so large that it becomes a real issue. (Node centralisation) Off-chain solutions are needed to relieve the congestion and constrain the blockchain size. Off-chain solutions do work, the lightning network is an off chain solution and we are currently awaiting for its implementation 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:35:54

I think the disinformation campaign is a sign they are very concerned about the lightning network spoiling their party.

My reference is the current state of Bitcoin, this year. Because it was this year the blocks have been consistently full, this year the fees consistently high and Bitcoin has been appreciating consistently this year.
Segwit exchanges, seek them out and you will find a few.
But I am referring to the primary intended use of Bitcoin, that is P2P transfers, in my case sending funds to my family. Segwit nano S to another other nano S. Broadcast is acknowledged within seconds, fees are as cheap as I want them to be, TX times as fast as I need them to be. 
I have no complaints because Segwit works for me.

I had quite a few BCH and dumped them all for two reasons.
One, I discovered the Chinese miners were right behind BCH at the very start and they funded its development, support and promotion. They have a complete monopoly with BCH now. 
Two, Roger Ver and his manipulation of the facts to suit his own agenda. Has to be THE most destructive person in this space today. He has so much to gain if he could topple BTC and supplant it with BCH. This guy is just a piece of work.

Coinspot is great for beginners that want to hodl coins online with coinspot but it's not an exchange but a trading environment. You pay higher prices there and you cant deposit coins from other exchanges into coinspot. If you transfer your coins from coinspot you effectively lose around 8%. The way its set up is to keep people within the trading environment. I would give it a miss and focus on Binance.

Its become more intense since the big block fundamentalists were all aligned with the birth of BCH. So now they have their coin and the line is drawn in the sand between them and the BTC faithful. The next step is to bring down BTC, extract their revenge and have their day in the sun. This fairy tale won't come true of course.

There is nothing backing FIAT currencies or Cryptocurrencies, each are volatile and each can fail.
Each are quite similar in many ways.
 
The dollar is a token which represents value within the national system.  The national system is Infrastructure, GDP, unemployment rate etc
Bitcoin is a token which represents value within the network.  The network comprises of nodes, mining operations, and the collective consciousness of the users

Nope, because long time BTC holders have been down this road so many times before.. and they know BTC will rebound. So the experienced BTC guys will never sell out.  I think the BCH cap has increased due to market manipulation through the big guys behind BCH selling their stash of BTC and buying up BCH

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:26:38
You didn't notice Bitcoin achieved a greater level of exposure and adoption in 2017 than any other year?  Adoption refers to the total amount of new investors/users. The majority though would be investors. Investors invest for profit not to spend.  The fees have risen because in 2017 this new wave of users and their transactions have meant most blocks have been full. Segwit was not adopted as hoped, partially because promotion was a problem, Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing department, it's an open source community project. 
Regarding spending Bitcoin, I spend it everyday, I pay my bills and mortgage with it..
When Bitcoin has the LN and we can do micro-payments I will spend my BTC even more.
I use a Segwit wallet and can dial up fees that are under 50 cents for P2P transfers to family and friends.
Sure, Bitcoin has a scaling problem and maybe a block increase to 2MB would have been good, but the developers chose Segwit and Lightning and this may have been a mistake, maybe not. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:53:23
You are a legend!

@_date: 2017-12-11 13:08:24
This one really has a very bad smell about it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:48:45
Jihan Wu is a genius ... a greedy genius.  
He has used us to create the perfect monopoly.
1. Manufactures the ASIC chips
2. Sell his Antminers to anyone..but only if you pay in BCH
3. Contruct's huge mining farms using his Antminers
4. Invests into other mining farms - which are basically under his control
5. Creates partnerships with other anti-Segwit Chinese miners ie: viaBTc
6. Creates his own Crypto-currency online newspaper
7. Drives further wedges into the scaling debate
8. viaBTC proposes a hard fork
9. Eventually BCH emerges and Bitmain/Roger Ver funds its development, promoting and infrastruture
10. Colludes with BCH in manipulating the market and even mines BCH at a loss for a while
11. Invests 3 million into viaBTC's new BCH ONLY pairing exchange
12. Actively promoting BCH within China using Chinas collective culture to rally support - in preparation for a change in policy in China.
Jihan Wu and Roger Ver will not rest until Bitcoin is supplanted by BCH.  I have no doubt that further down the track Wu will fork BCH and make it China's Bitcoin.
This is what happens when there is centralised mining. The tech he stole, ASICBoost, as the Op correctly highlighted wont work with Segwit. ASICBoost offers a 20% reduction in energy consumption which equates to more profits.
Lets not be hoodwinked by the Chinese mining cartel, they have been there from the start pulling the strings.
Haipo Yang and Jihan Wu both push this Satoshi vision false narrative to make it appear they are just doing the right thing by upholding Satoshi's vision and keeping Bitcoin pure. NO thats total BS.
Big blocks will provide them will more profits and Segwit/LN will reduce their profitability as ASICBoost wont work. Right now the Chinese mining cartel hold all the ace cards, they know it but most of us in the west do not.
BCH is the ultimate Chinese knock-off coin! The Chinese rejected and then copied Facebook, Messenger, Google etc etc watch their next move and fork BCH for China's own internal use.

If you say so, but the reality is Blockstream is a separate entity to the open-source core client development team. Whilst it was founded by a few core developers, the majority of the co-founders ( I believe there are 11) are not involved in core development.  Due to the lack of leadership demonstrated by Gavin Bell and Wladimir J. van der Laan the core project was divided and lacked direction. Blockstream has come in and turned things around, perhaps a little too late, but that remains to be seen.

I'm with you! Bitstamp is awesome
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:22:38
Sorry, but most of your points are incorrect and some need clarification:
1.Blockstream received venture capital from numerous investors, not  just AXA Strategic ventures. (AXASV) AXASV is high tech and medical investment arm of AXA group. AXASV is not a banking branch of ACA group.  They invest into high tech companies so they can reap a return some where down the track. The return wont be from Lightning or Bitcoin itself. But it will come from the patented technology that Blockchain has and will develop in the future for private off-chain solutions. 
2.Lightning Network is not a product that was created by or belongs to Blockstream or the Core Developers. Blockstream holds no patents on Lightning. I think you may be confused with Liquid.
3.Lightning is an open source project
4.Bitcoin started as an open source project and still is. Bitcoin avoids the need for trusted third parties and will continue to.
AXASV has nothing to do with Bitcoin. AXASTV is just a seed investor in Blockstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:19:31

@_date: 2017-12-26 23:17:27
Thanks for that. I can see there are some side benefits running a node. I'm in the process of setting up an old laptop as a full node to support the network, leaving it on all day every day, powered by an old UPS which gets charged directly from a solar array. I can do that because it won't cost me a cent and because our blockchain is still small enough to make it viable.

FinCEN has already made a determination on large nodes/mining operations. They do not fit within the definition of a MSB. LN Hubs would also fall within the scope of the document and therefore not be defined as a MSB
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:17:25
We already have centralised mining (Bitmain-viaBTC) we don't want full nodes to become the domain of those centralised miners as we already know they cannot be trusted.  We need more independant donor full and lightweight nodes. If we make it difficult or expensive for donor nodes to operate they will disappear. 
I see one of biggest problems right now is the power that is wielded by the Bitmain - viaBTC centralised mining pools. They instigated the malicious fork BCH. They support it with hashing power, fund its development, provide funding to an exchange to pair BCH with other cryptos, fund its promotion and the disinformation campaign against BTC.
Centralised mining and network nodes is not what Bitcoin is about.

I haven't heard of LN nodes being referred to as banks or acting like a bank. But I have heard people refer to LN hubs as money transmitters, MSB's and will need to comply with KYC/AML regulations and will need registration. 
But all of this is FUD and complete nonsense
By definition a lightning hub is not a money transmitter/MSB because it is not dealing with money, no dollars are being exchanged. 
Therefore, the KYC/AML regulations do not apply, MSB registration does not apply

Ok, I have a custom fee setting on mine (Nano S) I can drop it down to 10 sats per byte if I want. At that rate I can send 0.3 BTC for $1.05 never had any issues with rejection transactions. Anyway LN is just around the corner, in the meantime relax we are in a period of peak traffic with lots of FUD flying around and network spamming. It will pass in a few weeks.

Haha, keep telling yourself :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:10:44
Sorry, but I don't agree. 
AXA strategic ventures invests in many IT and medical companies around the world. They, like all other venture capital investors do so for a return on investment, they take a risk and sometimes get a return, sometimes not.  Whilst they operate under the umbrella of the AXA group and its old CEO used to have links to the Bilderberg Group what real significance does that have?
I think you have taken a few bits of information (that seem to fit within a preconception) joined the dots and now the Bilderberg Group is trying to control Bitcoin through Blockstream. To be honest I find that ridiculous. 
I could easily apply the same 'logic' to any coin and find something equally as suspicious and join the dots. To test that lets pick a random coin :) What about BCH?
BCH has some truly suspicious links to the Chinese miners and I could join plenty of dots there and come up with many theories..
Or I could look at Bitcoin Unlimited and their technology partner 'nChain' (faux satoshi's company) and look at their recent partnership with SBI.
Now SBI is an interesting company, they own a bank and have interests in other banks overseas. I could join some dots there and come up with a similar theory to yours. But without facts there is little point drawing conclusions .. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:30:13
Once they had committed to Segwit and lightning there was no need to upgrade the block size with a hard-fork. So the developers thought that had done enough at that point, but other groups didn't feel that way..

Very disappointing, such a slick GUI and user experience, the lack of support for a very important upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol is really inexcusable. I wont be using Exodus for securing my crypto anymore..

Bcash - Fair enough, point taken. 
We all know fees and times have to come down and they will and are slowly. But not everyone spends their Bitcoin natively, in fact its quite difficult to do so and that applies to all other cryptos. We are not mainstream yet. So meanwhile I spend my Bitcoin on everything and anything anywhere for a tiny fee. I simply charge up my zero fee debit card through a local service  (livingroomofsatoshi.com) and go spend

I think the currency itself is fine, its the toxic promoters behind BCH that are earning the coin its bad reputation. The BCH community on the whole seem quite genuine and adoption focussed. Of course they have their trolls and so do we.
What they (BCH community) are now slowly waking up to is they have been subjected to an elaborate con.
But it seems there was a con within the con (there always is) so now CSW, Bitmain, Amaury and viaBTC are all at odds with each other. All had different agendas  and now those agendas are out in the open for all to see.  Roger Ver is probably still dazed by it all and doesn't know what to do.
The community is trying to convince themselves its all OK, but it's not, BSV will cause a hard fork and people will loose money. Hopefully when all this is said and done, the BCH community will realise that perhaps BTC is the better Bitcoin to follow. We do not have any toxic promoters and that Lighting and Segwit are not as evil as they were first led to believe

Completely agree with ALL of your points.
Good post and well constructed.
I do think we have been caught with our pants down this year, the block sizes have been maxed about for most of 2017 and now we are at crisis point due to the sudden increase in adoption during the last few months AND spam created no doubt by the backers of that malicious fork that would like to steal the Bitcoin name and market share.
I think our only salvation right now is the lull over the Xmas period and the LN, which by all rights we should have had at the start of 2017. Its long overdue .. we need it by Feb 2018 at the very latest.

Baiting is not required in this subreddit, just ask the question and you will get plenty of answers. Here is your answer. CME, Nasdaq, Wall St are going to short BTC. So we are going to have some serious dips. Right now there is plenty of dumb money in BTC and that means weak hands.. So it's going to be an interesting ride, hold on tight

9 years of user trust and confidence for one.
A highly experienced Core development team doing their best to keep Bitcoin secure for us all. Since bitcoin is the base pair for most cryptos if something was to happen to Bitcoin it would have knock on effects across the entire crypto-currency world. So far they have done a stellar job. 
Bitcoin has been good to me, so I wont abandon it just because we are sailing through rough waters.
The other coins have had the luxury of being able to start from scratch or hardfork from Bitcoin etc and modify the code. Its too risky for Bitcoin to hard fork right now, there are significant security risks. Instead Bitcoin implemented Segwit and now the lightning network will complete this VERY significant upgrade to Bitcoin and put it on track for the future. When Lightning is implemented Bitcoins popularity and reputation will improve and a lot more investment will follow. This will increase the value of Bitcoin in a huge way, wouldn't you like to be onboard at that time and reap the rewards for being patient?

Ledger Nano S - cost me $127 and its been the best investment I have made to date.  Safe as all my BTC are stored offline and it's only the size of USB thumb drive. A 0.05BTC TX if sent today at full priority would cost $35 USD, using the Nano S and custom fee of 10 Satoshi's per byte costs around 30-45 cents depending on the day, its slower but for my purposes I'm fine with that
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:17:23
I recently read there were some strict rules imposed in this subreddit back in 2015. There was too much non-Bitcoin discussion going on and also the scaling debate was becoming way too nasty. The subreddit was loosing its focus and becoming a hostile environment.  So a statement was made regarding these issues and some very strict rules were laid down. So maybe some of your posts contravene these rules. I too have had a post or two removed and was pissed, I asked why and was given a reasonable answer so took it on the chin. I think the rules are here with the best intentions, to keep the subreddit focused on Bitcoin and Bitcoin only and to maintain a sense of order. Not sure why your meme would be banned, but maybe you could send the mods a message and ask whats going on..

It's a good plan and there is hope you can achieve your aims. Especially now the alts are racing ahead. I converted $160 worth of BTC that I mined years ago and built it up slowly into 0.5 BTC, took a lot of hard work, late nights and study.. I added $5000 into the mix and worked that up to 3.8 BTC within a few months. 
$100 is best put into the penny coins, like Tron, Verge, Cardano etc. I bought a few hundred dollars worth of Verge and XVG few months ago and they have now turned into 0.51 BTC as of today.. a fantastic return on investment.  
If I can do it, so can you!

Blame? No, a statement of fact.
Not a conspiracy theory, not rumour, just fact.
BCH were are hell bent on supplanting BTC from the start.
BCH is the Chinese mining cartels coin, they used the big block divide for their own purposes, it's not about satoshi vision for them its about the $$$$ vision. They picked their alliances in the west well and used them, they made the Satoshi white-paper fundamentalists THINK BCH was a noble cause.. once again the Chinese and their long terms plans win out over the west and our short sightedness..only much later on, when its too late will the BCH crew realise what has really gone down here.

BTC has 9 years of trust and confidence in the protocol and the ability of the core developers to keep Bitcoin secure and bug free. They have an enormous responsibilty, any screw up and it effects Bitcoin and every other crypto thats paired with it. BCH was instigated by a Chinese miner pool viaBTC and Jihan Wu they just wanted big blocks and a ASICBoost friendly coin to mine.  So far they have shown their hand at every turn, BCH is now shrouded in accusations of market manipulation, insider trading and miner collusion. Some of which are factual. Neither BTC or BCH are a currency for day day use simply because they both have 10 min confirmation times and the market is not ready for a digital currency at this time anyway. BCH has faster confirmation times and cheaper fees because its a new fork, doesn't have the user base to create network congestion. There is nothing in the tech behind BCH that makes it faster or cheaper than BTC..its all about the state of the network
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:49:04
Even some BCH supporters I know have abandoned BCH due to Rogers very childish and often erratic behaviour, he is not a good steward for BCH or any coin. He is simply the most destructive and careless person in this space.

That's not good, sorry to hear that. Its because of the state of the network at the moment, it's not good, but will get better.  My guess is the ATM is programmed to use priority as a default for transactions, which means high fees but faster conformation times. At the moment BTC is on the verge of a very significant upgrade to speed and much much lower fees. This current situation is unfortunate but it's not pernament.. I know thats cold comfort.

I'm an average user and I always dial up a custom fee, and I always save by doing so. 
29 transactions made and 29 transaction have confirmed.
I use a sat/byte ratio that suits my requirements, speed is not always a priority. If I am sending BTC to family members or friends and they don't need it in a hurry I save BIG. My average TX fee is under $1
Sorry, but I don't think you have an insight into what the average user wants.

BCH lost their credibility in August this year when they engaged in market manipulation and miner collusion. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:22:52
What people don't understand they tend to critisize. I would wager that only a handful of the anti-Lightning brigade have even read the Lightning white paper. Fact is BCH have a lot to worry about when lightning is deployed for BTC, I am sure they realise that. I think the LN FUD they go on about comes mainly from their concern about BCH rather than their concerns for the BTC network. They are worried Lightning will hinder BCH adoption, and that is a real concern, it definitely will! Both coins can/could coexist but BCH doesn't want that, they want BTC's marketshare and the only way they can 'try' to grab hold of it is by market manipulation, miner collusion and generating FUD and anti-BTC propaganda. They have thrown everything at BTC and look which coin is failing right now. BCH Sats are down 60% from a few weeks ago.
The truth of the matter is Bitcoin needs to scale both in terms of throughput and functionality and the best way to do that is to add layers. The internet scaled in a similar way. There is nothing to fear from LN, no banks will control the network (its impossible) and the IRS wont regulate the hubs. Its all childish nonsense designed to create uncertainty

The MIOTA is not as currency for day to day spending at the local shops, it's a token to support the exchange of nano-payments between devices

Now what has any of that got to do with Blockstream and Bitcoin?
Today, currently?

I think the initial idea behind Blockstream was to create a commercial arm to support core development. Open source is great when you are dealing with code only, however maintaining Bitcoin also involves a huge economic responsibility. So your core team really needs to have some full time 'shit hot' coders and great coders deserve/demand high salaries. Many people seem to take the view there is something fundamentally wrong with one or two of the core developers being paid by Blockstream or the Bitcoin foundation. If we look at BCH for example, the lead developer of BitcoinABC is Amaury Séchet and he is being funded by a group of Chinese miners and Roger Ver. Amaury, Jihan Wu, Haipo Yang and Roger Ver were all part of the drive behind Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Cash is basically their product. I see that as being a huge conflict of interest, a huge red flag if ever there was one.

@_date: 2017-12-21 10:21:21
But Blockstream isan't Bitcoin, they help fund development and provide a big brother function, but as far as I know at no time have they stood over the Dev's or coerced them. BCH has Bitcoin Unlimited and they plus the primary BCH developer are funded, in part, by Bitmain. Whilst Blockstream have a number of corp venture capital investors (this is the norm with most startups) I can see no direct links with a bank.  The same can be said about BCH tech partners and SBI Japan. But it's a pointless argument. 
BCH originated from Bitcoin Unlimited, years ago viaBTC and Bitmain called for a hard fork because they wanted Bitcoin to scale with big blocks, mind you this started when Bitcoin had an av 55KB block size! They wanted big blocks because that would increase their profits, they didn't want lightning because they wouldn't be able to use ASICboost (stolen tech) to decrease their energy requirements. AND with big blocks Bitmains antminer rigs would have a longer useful lifetime. So big blocks great for Bitmains bottom line, Segwit and LN less profits.
Whilst there is some blame that can be directed at the coordination of the CoreDevs, they knew from the get go what the miners wanted and why, they viewed the Chinese mining cartels as bad actors. The Chinese responded by resisting Segwit adoption and forking their own coin.

They are technical issues, but also user issues because we the Bitcoin community have been slow on the uptake of Segwit.

BCH Block size MAX is much higher than BTC but their blocks are in fact only 100KB on average. Large block size MAX doesn't equate to cheaper fees. Their network is not being spammed and does not have heavy traffic and BCH is only months old. Thats the reason why BCH is faster and cheaper. However they push the false narrative that BCH is fundamentally better than BTC and thats why their fees are cheaper and TX's faster. Misleading tactics to persuade newcomers to their dark neck of the woods

Of course more miners add security, they run full nodes.
Full donor nodes validate transactions and blocks, we need more full time donor nodes. I don't agree they delay the network after the first few thousand and anyway most are only active when their owners are not using the internet. White-paper? It's simple economics, bigger the blockchain more bandwidth required, more storage space needed. Donor nodes rely on people utilising their older equipment, because they don't want to use their main PC as a node. This costs them nothing. If they needed to purchase a bigger HDD, ie: spend more money just to run a donor node it's likely we would loose many donor nodes. Decentralisation of full nodes is one of the main aims of the Bitcoin system. We need more donor nodes

We all need to use Segwit, there is no excuse guys, if we ALL make an effort (I have) to use a Segwit enabled exchange and a Segwit wallet then we can help ourselves to lower fees and the mempool will be able to handle more transactions.

Succeed in busting Bitcoins marketcap.. I doubt it. Succeed in being used more than Bitcoin..again I doubt it. BCH is just another cryptocurrency alternative with nothing special to offer over some of the other alternatives. Its being promoted (hyped up) on the premise it will change the world, replacing world currencies and other such nonsense.  Interesting that ALL of the high profile people that are promoting BCH on this false premise also own mining operations.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the motives here. From where I stand BCH is over-hyped and is no better than other more established cryptos like Litecoin. Larger blocks yes and whilst that keeps transaction fees low it will further centralise mining.

The market is driven by economics and human emotion.
Confidence and trust has a big influence on the value of Crypto's.
We have just been through a perfect storm..
1. Christmas period - people are cashing out to buy presents, go on holidays
2. Network spam from bad actors - I think we all know who they are
3. Blocks full
4. Lots of bad press from banks, financial institutions
5. Media speculating about the bubble about to burst
6. Roger Ver spreading FUD about BTC to elevate the Chinese miners coin..BCH  (Wu-coin) 
7. Many people have purchased the leading crypto's with credit cards and as soon as the prices dipped they bailed out
The Bitcoin fundamentals have not changed, so I'm sure the price will rise soon.
But we need to implement the lightning network as soon as possible or we will be in serious trouble within a few months
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:34:45

It's a nice shower thought but the reality is a global breakdown will effect Bitcoin, for number of reasons. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:45:02
Most of those that donate our old computers with smallish HDD's to act as nodes do so only to support the network and thus perform a community service to Bitcoin. The blockchain is almost 2 GB, if we went mainstream and we kicked up to 700 TPS the blockchain would become enormous and bandwidth requirements would increase, this would cause many people to deactivate their nodes. The remaining larger nodes would probably be operated by miners/exchanges perhaps even corporations.
Segwit and Lightning are solutions that will allow BTC to scale and also to shake off the 10 min block time and become virtually instantaneous all without screwing around too much with the essence of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:16:47
I would agree that there is a lot of exaggeration going on with the fees and conformation times. I have never paid a $50 fee and I'm buying and sending BTC several times a week for friends and family that want to get into bitcoin.
Using a Segwit wallet and dialling up a custom fee saves a lot in fees.

Chinese miners are behind the creation of BCH, they wanted bigger blocks and a coin that was ASICBoost friendly. They invested heavily into Bitcoin Unlimited and provided funding for the development of BCH together with Roger Ver and his Bitcoin.com. They also created a BCH pair ONLY exchange and starting a propaganda war against Bitcoin. Then colluded with BCH to mine it at a loss and also spam the Bitcoin network. All of these activities work towards more profit and power for Bitmain/Antpool/ViaBTC/Bitcoin.com

Firstly the core developers do not develop the lightning network, it's a third party application, they can only implement lightning when its been completed and passed the testing and debugging stages - which are currently underway.
The LN white-paper was presented in 2015 and the application was still in its infancy at that stage, so it could not have been implemented 2 years ago.
I cannot recall paying $40+ for any BTC transaction, but I use Segwit and during times of severe congestion/spam attacks I simply avoid making BTC transactions. Thats only been a few times this year. August/November/December
Current high fees and delays is partially the fault of exchanges and users not using Segwit enabled wallets, I save bucketloads in fees by using Segwit and setting a custom fee that suits my requirements at the time.

"Also many Core developers are on Blockstream payroll which is a large conflict of interest" Many? Perhaps you mean one, or two. And what is the problem with that? If you look at a coin like BCH, its lead developer's big pay check is paid by the Chinese mining cartel and Roger Vers Bitcoin.com. Surely you must acknowledge that largest Bitcoin mining operation in the world paying the lead developer of BitcoinABC is the very definition of CONFLICT OF INTEREST
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:33:26
At one stage I was starting to believe the conspiracy theories.  So I did my own research and  looked into the history of Blockstream, their business practises and investor profile. 
In a nutshell: I found no substance to ANY of the negative claims being made.
There seems to be no nefarious agenda/intentions and there is no evidence at all of trying to control Bitcoin. They cannot do that anyway.  Blockstream is developing software/systems for exchanges and developing side-chains so corporations/business's can use the blockchain for non-currency purposes. Samson Mow is an outspoken individual that works for Blockstream, he is not the spokesman for Bitcoin. We are.
I strongly believe that Bitcoin needs companies like Blockstream to develop commercial applications otherwise Bitcoins enormous utility potential will be wasted.

I would hate to be a newcomer entering crypto for the first time now, this space in is utter chaos at the moment. Whilst Roger is the most vocal anti-BTC voice out there the greedy miners (Antpool/viaBTC) that wanted bigger blocks are the ones that deserve the greatest condemnation. They have been pulling the strings from the get go. They wanted bigger blocks when the av block size was just 55KB.. Big blocks = more profit and the useful lifetime of an antminer is increased. BCH is really the chinese miners coin they instigated it, they paid for its development and they support it, then they mine it... they created a very lucrative monopoly!

PoW is not a new or exciting concept either, the concept existed at least a decade before Bitcoin, but new or exciting is not the issue here. There is no doubt that PoS has several issues, but you claim there is no answer to this in the foreseeable future, I disagree.
I think PoW energy consumption issues are bad enough, but there are also other issues. You say PoW is more secure, but you are forgetting about mining-ownership-centralisation.  And I'm referring to Bitmain and associated companies/partners. We all know they are hostile towards Bitcoin and pro-BCH, given the right circumstances I have no doubt they would launch an attack on Bitcoin. They have already been caught discussing crippling Bitcoin before, and there is documentation in the public domain that proves that. 
In the beginning PoW was a terrific idea, but that was when enthusiasts could run a mining rig in their garage and earn some coins. Then Bitcoin mining was truly decentralised. Now we have a handful of super wealthy individuals of dubious character controlling the majority of the hash-power for Bitcoin.  At the moment we are hoping they don't abuse their power, we trust they wont.  But Bitcoin is not supposed to be based upon trust.
So do we just accept this risk, cross the fingers and keep on hoping or do we wake up and realise PoW is not the only solution and work on a better solution?

Yes, it works well when there is confidence in the market, but in times like these when everyone got a rude awakening in early 2018 confidence levels are down and so investment is low. If you had held onto the alts from that time all of your efforts would have been wasted as the alts have suffered more than BTC did.  The price of BTC, I think directly reflects the confidence in the market overall. At the moment many newcomers that entered the market late 2017 with the expectation that BTC would rise to dizzy heights have exited the market, disillusioned and many with credit cards and loans they have little hope of repaying. The boom we experienced has busted and now it will be a slow road back to where we were. There will be no bust outs or 30K BTC this year and probably not next year.  The only way we will go higher in the short term is investment and adoption in the third world, or massive uptake in the business world. Just my personal view of it all, I may be wrong and probably are :)

Finally,  we found Satoshi's hoard of 1Million chocolate Bitcoins...
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:01:07
There is no Bitcoin Daddy, just a few uncles, one of those uncles 'I believe' is Ian Grigg.
A couple of clues stick out..
1. Bitcoins backbone is based on Ian Griggs Triple Entry Accounting and yet Ian doesn't get a mention in the credits. I don't believe thats an omission. I think Ian wanted it that way.
2. The Bitcoin white paper and Satoshi emails are full of hyphenation, particularly between 'of' ie: proof-of-work, proof-of-worker. Ian Griggs whitepapers from the same era (of the Bitcoins whitepaper) are remarkably similar in this manner and there are other similarities.
3. Ian Grigg says he knows who the Satoshi team members are/were and he validates the statement with CARS. A man with such a high profile, one that is so respected in the cryptographic community is unlikely to make such a statement if it was false, what has he got to gain by telling such outrageous lies?
4. Ian has been talking about Tulips and Bitcoin for a long time before CSW became known to us.  If you look into his archive of texts, emails and videos you can see the concepts of Bitcoin were already being laid down. Also Ians long association with digital currencies, the flower currency project and the DigiGold fiasco  provides further circumstantial evidence or clues.
There is more but its of a private manner and its inappropriate to mention in an open forum. Perhaps in time all of that will become public anyway.
Suffice to say 'I believe' the evidence is overwhelming that Ian Grigg was part of the Bitcoin project either as an advisor of sorts or directly involved, either way its clear to me that he knows who the members are.

At a time when there is so much demand and congestion the smart play is to use another crypto - I use Litecoin (2.5 min confirmation times) to move funds to an exchange then trade for BTC. 
BCH is a malicious fork, like 2X was because the intention from the get go was to supplant BTC.
BCH has no intention to save BTC and using BCH will not save BTC as it doesn't need saving.
The hype and FUD from the BCH camp is rising and it's a sign they are worried that LN will be a game changer for BTC.
LN for BTC is coming very soon! Instant confirmation times and super cheap fees .. LN is already working on LTC

He is either delusional or he is using "Satoshi Vision' as tool to convince the gullible that BCH is aligned with Satoshi's vision.
Thing is there is no such thing as Satoshi's Vision, nothing in the whitepaper, nothing in his forum posts or emails that suggests he had a grand vision. 
Satoshi was always open to change, he suggested things to try and asked the developers what they thought, there was no SOP that said this is the goal, this is what we need to get there. When he stepped down he allowed the community of developers to take over and develop the protocol further.

A simple hypothetical for you...
Lets suppose you bought into Bitcoin in December 2017 but then the value drops shortly after.
Are you going to wait for the price to rise or are you going to spit the dummy and sell and make a big loss?

Yes, it seems he was a long term thinker and was focussed on one step at a time, taking it slow and easy along the way. He wanted the cypherpunks and IT enthusiasts to mine the coins, trade them between each other for goods or services and then eventually use Bitcoin on the internet. I think Bitcoin took off way too quickly for his liking, his intentions are evident in the appeal to not use Bitcoin for donating to wikileaks. He didn't want Bitcoin to rise too quickly, not before the code had matured.

@_date: 2018-08-25 10:38:16
Thing is many white-papers do outline the philosophy behind the idea, but Satoshi simply stated the aim in a very short and concise manner. He could have gone on about the many reasons why Bitcoin could revolutionise the world of finance and save babies etc but he refrained from delving into the politics of money. I'm surprised that he didn't do that. Even more surprised that some have the gaul to put so much spin on what little he did say and turn that into Satoshi's Vision.
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:29:39

There is no one person called Satoshi, thats the pseudonym for the group.
Originally there were 3 active members of the group, another not so active and 1 has since passed away. One member eventually took the reins whilst the others took a back seat. That member mined the most Bitcoins. 
These people are hiding in plain sight, if I can find them so can anyone else, but does it really matter who they are? Knowing that wont change anything and their identities wont come as a big surprise anyway.

Predictions are useless at this point, the market is still trying to come to grips with Dec 2017, just like it did when Mt Gox imploded.  Recovery takes time, there wont be any moonshots anytime soon, not unless there is a huge run of really really good news for BTC. There was a time when just plain old good news was enough, not anymore. I'm bullish for BTC but over the long term, a slow rise is what we need and we need a BTC thats worth a lot more than 20K for it to stabilise and become a currency that inspires spending. Right now we are the early adopters and we just learned (I hope) a very valuable lesson

Variable transaction fees are not the real issue at this stage anyway, because Bitcoin, along with all of the other crypto-currencies have not matured into a currency for day to day use.
Right now its a speculative investment, you know that, I know that, everyone should know that.
We can only afford to spend it because its increased in value over the years, when the value drops back we hodl. Like now, in a bear market.
Thats not a practical currency, not yet anyway.
Bitcoin needs to gain a lot more value and acceptance before it starts to stabilise and become a practical currency for day to day use. However in the meantime its blockchain has other uses.  
As Satoshi once wrote: 
"The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future​"
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:03:47
Yes, CSW is a pathological liar and his ex wife even calls him a sociopath. His cryptographic proof to the public general was a farce, we all know this. But does that mean he was not part of the Satoshi group? Dave didn't write Bitcoin, he helped write an e-learning software package with CSW. The Dave and Craig collaborations were more about the mining side of Bitcoin. Uyen didn't write Bitcoin as she came along in 2012. Uyen was 'officially' employed as a product manager for Hotwire and as a representative in the US. Who coded Bitcoin is not important who created 'Bitcoin' is, it was not CSW but he was part of it, Ian Grigg is involved FAR more than he has alluded to. Satoshi was a group effort but Craig took the lead as the others lost interest.
If you research all of this with a preconception that Craig was not part of Bitcoin hen you wont get anywhere. We all don't want Craig to be part this, but the facts say otherwise. This guy is more dangerous to Bitcoin and crypto-currency than most people realise, we dismiss him because we think he is full of BS, but he capable of doing a LOT of damage. CSW wont stop, he will never stop, he doesn't care about who he takes down or the damage he creates along the way. We should all be very concerned about CSW and his actions rather than if he was or wasn't part of the Satoshi group, that question doesn't matter anymore. The best thing that could happen right now is Craig hard forks BCH and goes his own way, then he wont have the same level of public backing and he may just fade away..

Within this sub-reddit it is uncommon for us to use it. Some people refer to it in a innocent way, not really knowing what it means. I guess they heard it before so they think it exists. They think it just refers to Satoshi's general plan for Bitcoin. I dont have a problem with that. 
But its used everyday in the 'hijacked' btc sub to refer to how Bitcoin developers have somehow contravened Satoshis Vision by deploying Segwit and Lightning. At the extreme end it's used by those toxic enfluencers CSW, Calvin Ayre (coingeek), Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Haipo Yang. All of those people I mentioned are large scale miners that provide the majority of the hash power for BTC or/and BCH. They have an agenda to push when they refer to Satoshis Vision. I'm guessing you have not seen that, but these people are the ones which have been trying to divide the Bitcoin community with their Satoshi's Vision propaganda and other tools of deception. However that now seems to be backfiring because they are causing division within their own community with the same propaganda tool they constructed to divide ours, very ironic I think. 
With regards to the examples you asked for, first stop should be the conference that is called "Satoshi's Vision' proudly hosted by Bitmain (Jihan Wu) Bitcoin.com (Roger Ver)  Coingeek (Calvin Ayre) and nChain (Craig Wright) This conference is staurated with references to 'Satoshi's Vision' 
I dont wish to promote that other sub which hijacked Bitcoin discussion so I wont post any links here. I'm sure you can search there yourself. It wont take long to find countless examples on how the term is used to denigrate Bitcoin and to further their aganda, essentially trying to brainwash people (and themselves) into thinking their community is reviving Bitcoin, reviving Satoshi's Vision and bringing Bitcoin back.

Lightning was designed for small/frequent payments. The main aim was to help restrain the size of the blockchain and reduce fees. Space within the blockchain is valuable so we shouldn't waste it with recording coffee and donut transactions, enter lightning. Over time Bitcoin will be used more and more for business, so in the future other side chains will be created to cater for those users.
On-chain transactions are currently very reasonable, quite cheap really, and the blocks are rarely full now.  When demand increases and we need bigger blocks I am sure the developers will make the move to increase them. If our block size keeps up with actual demand the cost of performing on-chain transactions should remain reasonable and affordable for all users.

I think its fairer to say Bitcoin mining 'has become' centralised by a handful of very very large mining pools, most of which are owned/operated by Chinese entrepreneurs.  And yes some of these pools are located within China.  This is very concerning as Bitcoin works best when mining is decentralised over many independent miners. Centralised mining (as in ownership centralisation) is a serious threat to Bitcoin especially when the main owner of these pools is NOT a Bitcoin supporter and it could be to his benefit to attack the network or starve it of hash power whenever he feels it will be advantageous. Of course I am talking about Jihan Wu and his buddy Haipo Yang.

That doesn't work when the miner (Bitmain and co) have a vested interest in another rival blockchain BCH, have just converted most of their BTC to BCH and have recently stated "hahaha Oh BTC is just a short term profit vehicle for us, hahaha"
It's interesting that as we discuss this that community and the miners are in embroiled in bitter conflict, its interesting to watch this play out, some big lessons for us all. We can never assume or hope large scale miners will play fair. CSW threatens the community and other miners "If you don't accept my 128MB blocks you do not get my IP, my apps nothing" Consensus in PoW doesn't work well when you have clowns with big bucks and ego's holding the majority of the hash power.

It's a big issue. But the Chinese gov is not the problem, it's the monopoly the Chinese owned mining pools currently have. They are not fans of Bitcoin, they mine it for the $$, they are pro-BCH because they have more control over it and see it as their baby in many ways.

There is no doubt Satoshi would have had strong political/economic views, but it seems he kept those to himself.  He wasn't a person to talk about his personal beliefs, his communiqués were focussed on the tech behind making Bitcoin work. So we can only guess what his vision was. But we may be completely wrong. When you look deeper and examine the early versions of the code there are some curious inclusions that make you wonder about the origins of Bitcoin. I have no idea what Satoshi's vision was, it could have been to create a wealth system for himself and his collaborators, I simply do not know. 
So there are two parts to this, the creation of SV when there was none (that we know of) and then the use of that term to undermine and divide the Bitcoin community and create an us and them. If you follow the trail it tends to lead back to the outspoken promotors that are also large BCH scale miners. Most of those people are no strangers to deceptive business practises and they have harnessed SV as a tool to further their agenda. Fortunately many people seem to be waking up to this.

Lightning is designed for small/frequent transactions, it helps restrain the size of the blockchain and enable cheap micro-payments. We need off-chain solutions, as adoption increases both in the consumer and commercial sectors, off-chain will become be a nessesity. Many people mistakenly beleive Lightning is a stand alone scaling solution, it is not. Bitcoin will scale and meet demand by increasing the blocksize..and this will happen, the core developers have stated this will happen. 
I dont think we have anything to worry about, Bitcoin will remain cheap to use both on or off chain into the near future. Beyond that we may see a very expensive Bitcoin and that is needed for Bitcoin to become a stable reliable currency.

I'm confused. I have always understood that running a node, as you say, benefits the network.  I've even had a go at running one myself for a while and felt good about supporting the network. But there are many who categorically state this is a fallacy, there is absolutely no benefit to the network at all, not unless you are a miner.  There is so much disagreement about this at the moment.  CSW is on about this every other day and I would love to see someone take him on about this and prove him wrong.  Surely this issue should be easy enough to prove, technically, one way or another?

It was a perfect storm last December, there was massive uptake due the hype surrounding futures and every man and his dog was buying Bitcoin because they 'thought' futures would bring them some easy profits.

Behind all of that is their 'belief' that BCH is more inline with Satoshi's vision as was laid down in the whitepaper. This is a total fallacy as Bitcoin is an open source project and was left to the community to develop beyond the scope of the original whitepaper. Besides that the whitepaper does not mention a vision, or a philosophy it's a technical document that provides a basic overview, a how-it-works. As whitepapers go its actually very brief and lacks detail. Bitcoin was open sourced so it could be used and developed and not frozen in time inline with the original whitepaper and code.
However, they continue to use this falsehood to elevate BCH above BTC and much of the BCH community has bought into this nonsense.  They have been conned. They refer to the whitepaper like it's the masterplan for Bitcoin and any deviation from the whitepaper automatically disqualifies Bitcoin as being legitimately Bitcoin. This, of course is complete and utter BS.
Its propaganda designed to rally the BCH community and convince (brainwash) newbies away from Bitcoin towards BCH.
Spearheading this propaganda war against Bitcoin are Roger Ver, Craig Wright (nChain) and his cohort Calvin Ayre, along with Jihan Wu and Haipo Yang on the side lines rubbing their hands with glee. You may not know of these people and which companies they represent but in time you will get to know all of them.
What is really important here are motives. ALL of these high profile promotors also operate very large BCH mining operations. ALL will gain financially if BCH adoption increases. ALL are millionaires or billionaires in their own right. They all have enormous resources and energy to rally against Bitcoin.  ALL have their own media outlets/forums/websites to propagate this con job. ie: Bitcoin.com/Coingeek/8btc etc.
These people want to railroad Bitcoin because they think it will increase traffic on BCH. More traffic more valuable BCH becomes to them. These people act as though they own BCH because as majority miners they have the right to decide what happens on the chain and how the protocol is developed.  Some of those promoters want to destroy Bitcoin, two of them have even more sinister motives. What is all of this about?.. Greed, statue and power.
This is a one sided propaganda war based upon deception and greed. Try to ignore it if you can, as a newbie all you need to know is your money is inherently much safer invested in Bitcoin than BCH.  In time you will piece all of this together, it just takes time and a lot of filtering.

Disagree, it certainly has many use cases and not just as a currency, more utility will come its still early days.

Sure no public blockchain crypto will become an accepted national currency, as a national currency represents that countries POW in terms of domestic economy and international trade.

Geographical centralisation is really not the issue and as you have stated many Chinese miners have moved outside of China.  Its ownership centralisation that poses the greatest risk for Bitcoin. Jihan Wu and Haipo Yang together provide most of the hash power.. and yet they are no friend to Bitcoin

I think the origins stem back to the scaling debate, we fractured ourselves, then influential people took advantage of this and used it to gain traction for their own favoured Bitcoin clients, when that failed they forked and created their own Bitcoin with big blocks. Surprise surprise these people had their own mining operations/pools and could now take advantage of mining the same coin they championed. Since the difficulty would be low at the start there is a lot of motivation to get in big and mine hard. Which is precisely what's happening/happened. 
Bitmain is a monopoly, it creates mining rigs, sells them, deploys them in their own massive operations. They host seminars, fund other mining operations like ViaBTC, they invest and have control in social media outlets like 8btc etc. Bitmain has been exposed in a plot to cripple the Bitcoin network to assist BCH gain traction, they recently scoffed and said mining Bitcoin is just a short term profit thing for them and laughed. 
The Chinese government would be looking VERY closely at Bitmain right now, perhaps KYC is a preemptive move to appease the central government.  And now they have now been caught red-handed lying about their IPO seed investors. Big big mistake.

Thanks. If anyone had a vision for Bitcoin it was Hal Finney. He suggested that in the future Bitcoin would need a Bitcoin-lite. A secondary payment layer for small transactions so the blockchain remained trim. That is exactly what we have now with the Lightning network. He also suggested to keep the block size small to provide a level of protection. Satoshi agreed. Then when absolutely nessesary raise the block size accordingly.

I think they (Wright/Ayre/Wu/Ver) are experts at game theoretics. They are  super smart and very sneaky, they lack ethics.. and nothing is off the cards for them. I think they are accumulating BCH for a reason and it's not to sell off, not just yet..

I'm convinced Satoshi was a small group of people working on a common goal, to make a digital currency that actually worked.  In the beginning their motives and aspirations were aligned, but I suspect things changed when Bitcoin became valuable.  I suspect there was infighting and a few members moved on. Leaving the face of Bitcoin, the persona we recognise as Satoshi in the forums and emails to carry on.  Eventually he lost interest or perhaps became ill and later passed away.

I get what you are saying. The important thing about lightning is its optional. We can transact on-chain or off-chain. Its totally up to the user.  Either way its still peer-to-peer and there are no trusted third party institutions, like banks, that are processing the transactions on our behalf. Lightning was designed for frequent small payments that would otherwise bloat the blockchain. If we want Bitcoin to last the distance we cannot rely upon Moores law. What was relevent in 1965 is no longer.
Bloating the blockchain with small transactions that dont need to be forever recorded is not smart. We dont want a 10, 50 or 100 TB blockchain in the future, that would be a disaster. Secondary payment layers for non essential transactions are essential. Even Satoshi and Hal Finney discussed this and Hal suggested that moving forward Bitcoin would have to incorporate a secondary payment layer.

Yes, good points.
We are now seeing (so are they) that ownership-centralised mining can jepardise an entire project when there is a conflict of interest or beliefs between miners and developers.

Not when we have ownership-centralised mining that also operate social media and news outlets, own exchanges, manufacture mining rigs and advocate and advertise coins they have a vested interest in.

Then you could also use Independent reserve, bitcoin.com.au digital surge and there are many more, some I haven't used myself and now there is Huobi Australia (just arrived)
When you want to sell your BTC, credit your bank account or pay bills with the proceeds go to livingroomofsatoshi.com.au

The majority of the Bitcoin developers wanted bigger blocks but when the timing was right. 
Unfortunately open source development moves slowly and the consensus process makes progress even slower.  However some high profile people with big plans wanted big blocks and they wanted them now, even though at the time there was no need. They took the question to the community and created a shit-storm. This shit-storm ultimately slowed Bitcoins development and adoption suffered. There is a LOT more to that story, suffice to say the divide that came about was used to great effect by two very large miners and a handful of high profile entrepreneurs.. and now we have BCH.  BCH came out openly as a hostile entity towards Bitcoin, its backers wanted to knock Bitcoin down and take its market share...a very short sighted, greedy and stupid goal if you ask me. What hurts Bitcoin will ultimately hurt BCH anyway.
Right now Bitcoin is doing fine with the current block size/weight. Once Segwit adoption improves (about 30% now) and lightning takes off Bitcoin will be in a good position to move forwards to seek greater adoption.

All of those people you mentioned also own mining companies that are literally mining the crap out of Bitcoin Cash. When the biggest promotors of BCH are also mining BCH its no wonder they want to increase adoption and try to squash its competitors. BCH mining is ownership centralised and now Craig Wright is dictating terms and threatening the community and other miners what he will do if they don't accept his 128 MB blocks proposal. I wonder what happened to that process called consensus?

I have read Satoshi's emails to the core developers, to the cypherpunk community, his close collaborators ie; Hal Finney and Marrti, I think I have read them all to be honest. Including some to Laszlo, Gavin and Mike Hearn. There was no grand vision. There was no statement made that forbids the community to alter Bitcoin. The basic protocol needed to remain essentially the same, we know that. But he handed over Bitcoin to the community to develop and then left. Even through the madness of the scaling debate he remained silent. It was given to us so it was our problem to solve. But now this Satoshi's Vision nonsence is being used by some strong enfluencers to further divide our community and rally support for thiers. 
I am sure Satoshi had a vision, but it seems only he knows what it was. I'm happy to admit I am wrong if someone could show me where he detailed his grand plan.

Control means what? Bitcoin is not legal tender anywhere and many countries have banned it. Bitcoin can be used as a currency of sorts in most first world countries so it’s already being used as an alternative but it’s not fiat and it’s not legal tender .. we are fortunate we have got this far. Dreams of replacing national currencies with bitcoin are fairy tales I’m afraid. Notice the emphasis I made on public blockchain that’s the sticking point here

@_date: 2018-10-27 04:48:05
It was a hypothetical question to help you understand the first major roadblock.  Unfortunately the people cannot decide what national currency a country will use as legal tender, it simply doesn't work that way. The market can decide to use a medium of exchange to purchase goods and services (like Bitcoin) but that medium of exchange cannot ever eliminate fiat.. not unless a government allows it to, and that wont happen.
There is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding out there, much of that comes from people not really understanding economics and currency, which is understandable as we don't normally study these subjects at college and most of us have to educate ourselves or take a uni course. 
Bitcoin was never designed to replace a national fiat currency, as per the original white paper Bitcoin was designed as a currency for the internet, a medium of exchange between peers. It has evolved since then of course and has become much more, more than Satoshi could have imagined. The community and its developers have got Bitcoin to where it is now. 
So yes if a country wants to go crypto they will be creating a fiat currency, it will be centralised, it will be under the control of that country. That is just how it will be, there is nothing anyone can do about that. However there is a slim chance Bitcoin could become a global reserve currency one day, so all is not lost. Bitcoin has been way over sold by people who simply do not understand its limitations. Air heads like Roger Ver who claim they are experts in economics have either no idea, are delusional or are deliberately misleading people.. I tend to think the latter is true.

@_date: 2018-10-26 22:44:39
Just goes to show how many people still don’t understand the fundamental economics of Bitcoin.  No country with an once of sanity will ever take on a cryptocurrency on a public blockchain as their national currency. Bitcoin is more suited as a reserve currency, but still has a long way to go. Liquidity is one important metric but stability is much more important. Imagine if your Swedish and the government looses the plot and the Krona is now exchanged for bitcoin and now bitcoin is your national currency.  How devastating  it would be for the entire population of Sweden to suddenly loose 2/3 thirds of their life savings if bitcoin takes a dive like it did in Dec 2017.  Or what happens if bitcoin surges and takes on massive gains. That sort of instability could ruin an entire country’s economy virtually overnight.  Apply that scenario to all G10 countries and you have a global disaster on your hands. In the future most countries will have their own cryptocurrency but it won’t be on a public blockchain and it will be a stablecoin. 
Bitcoin has a bright future as a medium of exchange and store of value. Anyone that tells you it replace a national fiat currency one day are either completely unaware of the economics or are deliberately trying to fool you.

USD is a global currency it is accepted in many countries as it’s only currency. In Russia it’s illegal to use it to purchase goods and service. But you can exchange it for roubles. This is the same in most countries. But there is always an underground market. USD Is particularly useful when there is hyperinflation with the local currency and/or economic instability so then it’s in high demand. Bitcoin can become can become a legally recognised global currency also but it has a long way to go and needs certain economic and regulatory factors to align for that to happen .. there is a chance though, buts it’s a slim chance. In the time being it can be used legally as a medium of exchange but not legal tender

Sure we did but it wasn't secure enough (doubles spends etc) and now we have an amazing system which doesn't bloat out the blockchain with potentially millions upon millions of transactions that don't need to be forever locked into the blockchain, transactions like buying coffee, cakes and bus tickets etc.  Thankfully we have developers that are taking Bitcoin in the right direction, at first many people thought not, but slowly the astute are waking up to the fact that off-solutions like Lightning are exactly what is required for micro-transactions. Whilst it's easy to critisize Bitcoin developers most that do have no idea what they are talking about, just blowing out a load of hot air.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:17:54
If you want to provide factual information in your post you probably do.
Why is it so important that exchanges offer Lightning? Lightning is a micro-payment system, its not designed for large payments. Large payments you want on the blockchain. Lightning is ideal for retail POS applications and sending small amounts of Bitcoin to friends, family, service providers and even moving small amounts onto exchanges. There are many large payment processors that offer Lightning.

I agree with your description of Bitcoins properties and its advantages over fiat. But you misunderstand the basic argument. There are three parts, 1/ Governments will, in the near future, replace their paper currency with a crypto version, but they wont choose Bitcoin or any other crypto on a PUBLIC blockchain. 2/ Bitcoin has properties that make it a better global currency (like the USD) than a national currency and it may or may not become that. 3/ Bitcoin was originally designed as a currency for the internet and to send payments/cash to peers, but it has been evolving into something more, we and the developers are deciding what Bitcoin is to become 
Of course people can decide to use what currency they want to use and we do already. But whilst we consider Bitcoin a currency it is not legal tender anywhere in the world, only fiat is legal tender and common law dictates that only a government can issue legal tender. In the early days most users generated their own Bitcoins through mining, but now the vast majority can only gain Bitcoins by purchasing them with fiat or through trading.  So right now Bitcoin is a medium of exchange like gold is. We can buy Gold/Bitcoin with fiat or we can mine them, and we cannot obtain Gold/Bitcoin natively. What I mean is we don't earn Gold/Bitcoin, our employers do not give us Gold/Bitcoin for a days work, they can (and a few do) but its not common practise.
It is one thing to have a basic understanding of the properties of Bitcoin, but in applying it in the real world you also need to have a sound understanding of the economic principles of money as legal tender, I'm not expert but I have studied it and once you do I'm sure you'll start to understand the bigger picture and where Bitcoin has a place and where it doesn't

So we need something else other than Bitcoin to cover all bases. We need Bitcoin as it currently is, with Segwit Bitcoin can scale and in time fees will lower. But we can no longer view Bitcoin as the crypto-currency for day to day purchases, it represents something a lot more important. For day to day purchases we have plenty of options. Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and new currencies like Verge. This notion that Bitcoin has to stay on track according to the 2009 white paper is a fallacy, we should move on from that pointless argument and focus on which coin or coins will assist Bitcoin, take the load off and become the day to day currency we are looking for. We have altcoins or a reason.

I think once people realise what money really is and is not, Bitcoin starts to make a lot more sense. Bitcoin has the store-of-value utility that the USD does not have. Bitcoin functions more like money than the USD does.

Sorry but I completely disagree.
Bitcoin doesn't follow the rules of economic rationality, its as valuable as what we consider it to be. 8 years of trust and confidence has, in part, created Bitcoins value. It's a store of value and a currency, but because it's appreciated in value so greatly many people prefer to spend fiat than Bitcoin.
A currency for day to day use must be stable and be trusted.
Bitcoin has the trust but until the price stabilises it makes for a poor currency.

Again you are focusing on the hypotheticals, as if it was my advice. 
 
But here is a real world example. I have a stash of Bitcoin which I use for trading and holding for the long term.  I mined a very small amount of Bitcoin in 2015. I blew the dust of that in July 2017 and it was worth just $160. I have since traded that into $13,200 USD through a lot of hard work and long hours. There is no way in hell I would have cashed out of my Bitcoins or spent it on anything other than other crypto. At every opportunity I buy more bitcoin. Come 2018 whatever Bitcoin I have now will be worth a lot more, that is the prediction anyway. So can you understand why a person like myself would never spend their Bitcoins on day to day expenses.
If you cannot understand that, then I think we are done here.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:38:01
Volatility is the key to profit, and risk comes with the territory.
Your best to forget about the USD/BTC price and focus on the Satoshi's. The target is to increase the amount of Satoshi's you have.
Day trading is very risky, tiring and addictive in all the bad ways. Be greedy, but not as greedy as others. Aim for 10%-30% and take it slow. Make sure you get enough sleep, drink lots of water and take frequent breaks. 
My advice would be to not day trade.
Just focus on a coin of choice, research its ATH and ATL study the crap out of it and wait for deep dips, then buy
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:41:45

An interesting POV, and thats OK, your entitled to that, regardless of whether you are totally wrong or right. But I tell you, Litecoin has served me well, I use it as currency and its brilliant, fast n cheap and the ethos behind Litecoin is what sets it apart the other Bitcoin fork wanna be's that can only use corruption, miner collusion and market manipulation to achieve their goals. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:07:47
Great post. The fundamental problem is we are not a community anymore. Once Bitcoin started to become a store-of-value and highly profitable to mine/trade the greed took over and the community spirit evaporated. It still exists, but only in enclaves. +1

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:48:46
Yes, I agree Bitcoin will become faster and cheaper to use. Thats on the way as you pointed out. But ultimately the users will decide. The fundamentals clearly dictate why no crypto-currency (not just Bitcoin) that is appreciating in value will be used for small day to day purchases. We all know the trend for Bitcoin is almost certainly up, as it rises its value increases, so would you spend any of your bitcoin to buy a toaster or a printer? I wouldn't because I know that $100 worth of sats I just spent on the toaster may become $300 in 6mths time. 
With Sewit and lightning and other off chain solutions Bitcoin will be faster, cheaper and more useful as a currency, but how many people will spend their Bitcoin? All of the above advantages will be more useful for those that trade from Bitcoin to altcoins.
Golden rule that few seem to follow these days, always trade an appreciating asset for another appreciating asset. I would sell my Bitcoins for a house or a collectors item, but I would never sell it for a depreciating asset like a toaster or a vehicle. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:58:15
Couldn't agree more, spot on.
I seriously doubt any malicious fork could topple Bitcoin, but if there was a perfect storm and it did falter almost all of us would be affected in some way. Seems Calvin Ayre is counting on that "Plotting the death of BTC and all altcoins, long live BCH"  
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:42:55
I really don't know much about the developers or Bitcoin Unlimited general staff members. So I have nothing to say about them. 95% of what is heard from the BCH camp comes from Roger Ver, Craig Wright and Jihan Wu. The dark investors are the driving force behind BU I feel, one of these is Jihan Wu who is not happy enough with manufacturing Antminers or running extremely profitable mining farms across China he also needs a measure of control over Bitcoin Cash. His reach extends way too far to be healthy for this space. 
It is all about money and control and the proof is right there for all to see. They haven't tried very hard to hide it. Attacking the BTC network is not going to further BCH adoption its all about trying to topple BTC to assert BCH as THE Bitcoin, which wont happen anyway despite their best efforts. meanwhile Dash is doing great and has no aspirations to topple Bitcoin, their growth is organic and they deserve to be succesful because they have worked hard and earned it.

Spot on!
Mainstream adoption and big blocks are a recipe for disaster.
Off chain is the way to go. Big blocks are a killer for donor nodes as they wont be able to keep up with the financial burden of adding on bigger HDDs. This will lead to centralised nodes (Craig Wright is preparing for that) The already geographically and ownership centralised mining ops in China will effectively push out the smaller mining operators and it will all go to the shit basically. Core has the right idea with Segwit/Lightning off chain solutions, they are prepping Bitcoin for mainstream adoption. Go core!

@_date: 2017-11-06 00:19:12
There's a difference. Day to day purchases and larger purchases.
You wouldn't spend Bitcoin or any other crypto that is appreciating in value on day to day purchases as most day to day purchases are depreciating assets or consumables. You may spend it on larger purchases that appreciate in value. Like a house in a good area, a collectors item or you may trade Bitcoin for altcoins, which is what most of us do.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:48:50
Last time they attempted to tank BTC it was their investors/supporter that lost out. This is not about ideology of scaling or Satoshi's vision its about greed, power and revenge.

@_date: 2017-11-23 22:46:13
Yes, it will go down, but that is just their published target for the start of their so called flippening. Because Bitmain is fully invested in seeing BCH win out over BTC they will have no issue with mining at a loss for a while. This is all a repeat of what happened 2x fork day and what happened? They slowed down the network,  fees went up and their pump caused a lot of their loyal supporters to loose money. However, the Bithumb outage put a spanner in the works and so it starts again

There needs to be a perfect storm within the next couple of weeks for us to dip that low. Maybe with this USDT nonsense there will be a considerable dip, who knows. But even if you got in now and purchased just 0.5 BTC you can use that to trade your way up to 1 BTC.  I traded my way up with just 0.03 BTC so I know its possible. With considerable research and nerves of steel anyone can do it. Sometimes you get lucky too.

Bitcoin is not as yet ready for everyday mainstream spending, but it's getting there!
At the moment Bitcoin is best for holding onto for future gains or trading for other crypto-currencies/tokens. If you had invested into just one bitcoin in January this year and sold it today you would have realised an (approx) 1000% return on your investment.

Yes, if Bitcoin can value stabilise in the future it would allow its use as a day to day currency. At the moment not being able to use Bitcoin for day to day purchases is not really as problematic as its made out to be. As much as this community talks about being ale to spend crypto in shops, I can but never do and I think that applies to most of us.

@_date: 2017-11-25 07:48:22
It's certainly problematic. You can't have a store-of-value that keeps on appreciating and a currency for Mr and Mrs public rolled up in the one coin. It doesn't work, for the reasons you put forward. If the tx times and fees were sorted and Bitcoins value was stabilised somehow the tables could turn and it would be fine as a currency but not a store-of-value. 
In the future I think Bitcoin and a number of alts will share the mainstream digital currency role.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:14:17

I think its price stability is what will set Litecoin above the other currency coins. A digital currency for mainstream use will have to be price stable or it will ultimately fail. I'm not sure how Litecoin can maintain the status quo, and as you say it is vulnerable through its low price.

No disrespect intended but I think I made my points quite clear, you may need to google what happened with BCH at the time of the proposed 2x fork to get further insight. This is the same action. If you look at the charts for BCH around that time you will see activity which has never been seen in this space before. And it's starting again. The BCH camp call it the flippening and some speculate it being part of a so-called operation dragon slayer. The pump is just the start the rest will follow during this weekend. Please look at the BCH charts now and look at the volume, this is not organic growth.

I very much doubt Bitcoin will fail, that is not my concern.
The act of trying to take BTC down or any other coin for that matter by attacking its network with spam or colluding with miners to starve it of hashing power is malicious and should be called out.

If it's economically viable for you to mine BTC then go for it because you'd also be doing the BTC community a huge favour. Every little mine out there counts to help decentralise mining away from the centralised and controlling Chinese mining cartels

I guess you think my statement is a criticism of Bitcoin.
It's not, it's simply a statement of fact.
If you had a commodity that was worth a lot of money and appreciated in value over time would you trade a portion of that commodity for something like a new toaster, printer or a cup of coffee? No. of course you wouldn't, if you did you would be loosing potential value that portion of your commodity would bring you in the future.
See what I mean. Bitcoin can now be considered a commodity. I would never sell one satoshi from my Bitcoins to buy a cup of coffee or to get that new shiney iPad. If I wanted to use a digital currency to buy 'something' I would use a currency that doesn't appreciate in value that much, so I can spend and feel confident that $100 worth of crypto I just spent won't be worth $300 in a years time. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:14:09

Bitcoin has become a store-of-value because its price appreciates so much. So these days Bitcoin is less of a viable currency for day to day purchases. But it now has a much more important role to play. Altcoins such as Dash and Monero are currency orientated and more suitible to handle small everyday transactions than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:59:20

That is precisely why this space needs to step up and self regulate and call out the bad actors. Most of this conflict stems form a long running argument about scaling Bitcoin, but with the BCH hard fork those that wanted big blocks, got them and so one would think this argument would have been over and done with. But BCH wants more, they want to attack the BTC network from many angles with the hope they can topple BTC, take its brand and market share. There is very little chance they can achieve this aim. But the very act of trying is bad enough and calling out this type of action is something we all should do as part of regulating this space.

You are right, it is still very early and I do think we can overcome most of the roadblocks. However the elephant in the room is the every increasing value of Bitcoin, the more it appreciates the less people will want to spend it due to the FOMO future gains. For Bitcoin to be a viable digital currency it has to be price stable, but if we tweak the code somehow to do that we loose the store of value aspect. Or should we just concede the altcoins are best left to cover the day to day currency role? I personally think that decision has already been made by the core development team a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:56:19
Thanks for your input. You are probably right the group I described is a minority. It is my group, it's the only one I'm exposed to. However the basic premise remains, if we were to use Bitcoin for day to day purchases then we'd have to have a stash of Bitcoin. I guess we could charge a crypto VISA debit card with that Bitcoin and spend it in that manner. But again why would we spend an appreciating asset?
No matter if you're a long term investor, a day trader or someone thats mined Bitcoin over the years you would still be very unwise to spend your Bitcoin for day to day purchases. However, if you're retired, unemployed and don't have income stream then I guess you have no choice. 
We all know of the 10,000 Bitcoin pizza guy story, right? If you were that guy that spent the 10,000 bitcoins on 2 pizzas in 2010 you would immediately understand my point, because you'd be forever punishing yourself for using your Bitcoin for a day to day purchase. With hindsight if you had kept those bitcoins, today they would be worth 72,000,0000 USD 
In the long run we will all spend our Bitcoin, but thats the end game, in the meantime accumulation and appreciation is the way we end up with more Bitcoin to spend at the end.

He wont provide cryptographic proof anytime soon. Once he has his key patents granted and  infrastructure in place then he probably will. But at this stage his strategy/game is to keep us guessing.
But signing a message is only one way to prove he is Satoshi.
It has been proven by other means.
Craig has a brilliant mind, but his personality needs some serious work. He is not a good communicator, can be childish and likes to mix bullshit with the truth. So Craig doesn't do much for his own credibility 
So you are right, Craig hasn't proved he is Satoshi, but it been proven
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:41:12
I agree, ASIC resistance is needed. Also exchanges need to step up and suspend trading on coins which cross the lines. Ultimately we need a global crypto-currency council of sorts that can lobby projects that show signs of corruption and step in when needed. We need to put in place some industry standards before the regulators do that for us.

Not criticising, but you don't understand Bitcoin economics 2017 version. Your comments may be relevant if this was 2010.
Times have changed, Bitcoin has changed, we have altcoins to provide the utility that Bitcoin is unable to provide. On the other hand altcoins cannot provide the utility that Bitcoin offers
In 2017 Bitcoin is a store-of-value and an exchange, no one in their right mind would spend it on small purchases
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:39:14
Mainly because people moved their holdings in altcoins to Bitcoin to get the B2X 1:1 freebie. So now B2X is cancelled they are moving holdings back into altcoins again. Other contributing factors also but this is the main reason.

I honestly cant see BTC being toppled by BCH, even with all of their dirty tricks on the table. But if they did then I agree, it will be worth a lot less. Because user trust and confidence will erode and those two factors are very important to the value of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.

In Jan 2018 you will look back at this decision as one of the best you have ever made. BTC holders now are in before Wall St and ETF's and lightning is coming on quicker than expected. 
Don't be surprised by a $15-$20K BTC by xmas
BTC has been through some tough times of late, now its about to get a huge shot in the arm, one which BCH will not be getting. I can only see a downward trend for BCH now, the hype is not matching reality and holders are already getting restless because many now realise they have been lied to. Whilst fees are currently cheap the transaction times are no where near as fast as first hyped. On two occasions I waited 20mins for a BCH transaction to be confirmed

@_date: 2017-11-23 21:37:40
Thank you for your constructive comments. I'm not concerned about BTC being toppled, it would take everything BCH has got and a perfect storm to even weaken it, so there is little chance of that happening. My concern is the very act of using market manipulation and miner collusion to weaken BTC or any other coin for that matter. I think its important to highlight these actions, call them out and demonstrate the crypto-community cares about regulating its own space.
At the moment we have to much centralised mining in terms of its ownership and location. If we had given BTC bigger blocks this situation would have become worse and the smaller mining operations would have a harder time competing. I think mining decentralisation is a key factor moving forward, hopefully Japan with be on board very soon and 3rd world countries also.

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:41:31
There is reason to be optimistic, extremely optimistic!
I don't think you realise what is just around the corner for BTC.
Anyone that is holding BTC right now should keep on holding, do not sell. This time last year $700 and now $8400 and that was through some tumultumous times, hard-forks, Ver-atology and Bitmain Cash trying their best to attack and topple BTC. 
Through all of that BTC has gained more user confidence, more investment, more value
But now Wall St and ETF's are coming... this is big, very big.
Expect anything from $15K to $20K by xmas, seriously
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:41:03

The big mistake many people make with Bitcoin is they compare it to traditional markets and economics. Unless you understand Bitcoin economics you know nothing about what may or may not happen.
Do you have Bitcoins?  If you do, what are your intentions, are you going to cash out due to your fear of the bubble bursting?
Take a tip. If you do have Bitcoins it would be wise to wait till at least Jan 2018 before you do anything.

"If it looks too good to be true, it probably is not true" That phrase or variants of, have been instilled into us from an early age. But I have found Bitcoin to be the exception to this rule. Even so, I am also careful and plan to cash out a portion of my BTC's in 2018 and then trade my way back up again.

A fork is malicious when it attacks the original chain to cripple or destroy it. You don't see this attack just yet because it wont start for a few more hours.   When the 2X fork was called off BCH did the same thing, you would have seen its effects because transaction times plummeted and fees skyrocketed. But the Bithumb outage stopped their pump and the momentum. Now they are trying again.

Good point.
I think the BTC and BCH camps both have some valid arguments.
However, BCH is employing corrupt trade practises and miner collusion to manipulate the market. In a regulated market Ver and cohorts would be sitting in jail at this time.

@_date: 2017-11-23 22:25:35
Do you have any idea why it's not ideal as a currency at the moment?
Why will BCH not end up with the same dilemma, it shares the same basic code?
Value appreciation, it encourages hoarding, people don't want to spend an appreciating store of value. If you had 1 BTC in Jan 2017 and you spent it all, you effectively threw away $7200 in potential gains. (referenced to today)
This currency issue is not as simple as people think.
BCH is just starting out, its only a currency in theory, not in practise.
If its value grows like Bitcoins has, it too will suffer the same consequence
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:12:13
Your transaction will complete, you wont loose your BTC. There is a great deal of market manipulation and mining collusion going on at the moment and hash power is being directed towards BCH (Bitcoin Trash) to prop it up. Your transaction will complete but it may take some time, once BCH gives up their hopeless attempt to topple BTC all will revert to normal.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:08:59
Spot on. Meanwhile Dash is moving forward, using merit and tech to increase adoption and it's working, they are gaining ground and doing deals in Africa and elsewhere. BCH should be more concerned about Dash than BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:45:35
I understand ABC is the reference client, BU is the organisation, behind BCH ...and yet it seems to have little control or concern over what is going on at present. 
It is an attack when Jihan Wu (a member and financial sponsor of Bitcoin Unlimited) and his associates collude to move hashing power towards BCH at times when mining BCH is less profitable. All of which coincided with BTC being spammed and BCH being pumped. That's a lot of coincidences .. more than any reasonable person would accept
The hostility and arguments should have stopped when BCH was forked, the big blockers finally got what they wanted. But unfortunately BCH wont stop attacking BTC because they want to become THE Bitcoin by any means fair or foul

My argument really comes down to the way we choose to spend, not so much Bitcoin itself. Hypothetical: If you had a wallet with $1000 worth litecoin and in the other wallet is $1000 worth of Bitcoin.

Much of that 50M is not organic growth or even whales having fun. Chinese mining cartel - using smaller subsidiaries to mine BCH - converting - buying BCH to prop it up through Bithumb.

The point is this, if people want to use a crypto for day to day purchases and dabble in the investment side of crypto then you will need to use two cryptos at the minimum. Bitcoin or Etherium, as the majority of the cryptos are paired with them. You will also need Litecoin or perhaps dash for the day to day purchases. The reason is Bitcoin is just too value to trade/spend on depreciating assets. Litecoin is price stable (to a point) so it make more sense to use it for a cup of coffee or dinner out on the town
If you're not interested in the investment side of crypto then you may never need to buy Bitcoin as you can trade fiat into Litecoin directly

We humans can be so cruel [sad face]
I am quite sure that you understand the title of Satoshi was not being transferred. 
But I'll bite while I'm waiting for my coffee to brew. 
If you asked for a poll of popular opinion you would find that our good mate 'Satoshi' was originally referred to in the singular. As time moved on it became obvious that 'Satoshi' was a signature for not just one person, but a small collective.
Once Craig Wright was outed or he outed himself, more information became available
Craig said he had the help of a few people, one of which we know was Dave Klieman. Dave has since passed away.
The other person, was speculated to be Hal Finney, Hal has also passed away. So of the three most likely to have collaborated to create 'Bitcoin' only one person is alive today.
Fast forward to 2017. These days, in terms of reference (not transference) those that know Craig was the principal Bitcoin architect now refer to Craig as Satoshi. Since it appears that you have not seen the evidence that proves Craig is Satoshi you may reply to this statement again with a slang term meaning a bovine with its nuts removed.
Or you may want to think outside the box and do your own research into Craig.. if and when you want to do that I'll be happy to point you in the right direction

Nothing, you will still have the same amount of Bitcoin.
However, Bitcoins value will slowly fall as volume moves back into altcoins. So don't be alarmed with the falling value of Bitcoin, this is expected. After the dust settles Bitcoins value will increase once again and the next ATH is only a few weeks away.

The old Bitcoin catch 22, I know it well!
Hodling..its the very reason why Bitcoin has appreciated in value over the years. 
The name of the game is not to spend your BTC for any asset that depreciates, trade it for other crypto you want to speculate on, but for day to day purchases is a no no.
Not spending really defeats the purpose that BTC was designed for, and there lays the evil paradox.
BTC is for big ticket items, like the new Tesla roadster (lambo's pollute) a new house or a trip overseas. But mainly its for your future, holding just 1 or 2 BTC now will hopefully in 10 years secure your financial future.. 
Enjoy your BTC profits by making more profits with them :)

Blockstream was founded by a few core developers, of which most still work for Blockstream. Blockstream is also one the core project sponsors. This may appear to be a conflict of interest since Blockstream has many high profile corporate investors. However, it 'appears' that the core development direction is not influenced directly by Blockstream. Fees are high and congestion is due to Bitcoins popularity, once Segwit and other innovations are fully implemented and adopted this will all change. Bitcoin is now a store of value and because it tends to continue to appreciate in value it would be foolhardy to spend Bitcoin on day to day purchases

Interesting that the sudden rise of BTG has occurred at almost the same time as the BTC pump. Interesting that a sudden pullback and small rise that just occurred happened at EXACTLY the same time to both BTG and BCH. Something is not right here. Appears both 'could' be working together to pull volume out of BTC. Pity because I was starting to respect the BTG project.

Well it could happen, but it's unlikely.
If they can sustain this attack on BTC over an extended period they cause a great deal of harm in terms of user confidence and this could lead to users moving to the dark side, so to speak. 
Because they have been so reckless and stupid with this pump the entire cryptocurrency community will soon learn that BCH is a scam coin and it and the team of corrupt individuals behind it are not to be trusted. So BCH now offers nothing but a quick buck during a pump. Not a coin to hold, not a project to admire.

I wouldn't be too concerned about coinbase from security aspect at this point. Maybe wait a little as hashing power is being directed towards Bitcoin trash and so transaction fees and speed is an issue. Give it a week or two to settle down, fees should reduce by then.

Yes, you could have .3 of each and later on, after a few weeks (to be safe) you can spend them independantly. But there are other scenarios that may play out which could affect the price of both BTC and B2X so by the time its safe to spend them the prices may have dropped quite a lot. Personally I think Bitcoin will remain the number one chain and B2X will loose any value it has at the start very quickly. I'm ignoring the B2X fork and carrying on as if nothing is happening. I'm using this opportunity whilst the alt sat levels are very low to purchase blue chips like Neo, Gas, WTC... When the dust settles and BTC flows back into the alts sector many alts will balloon in price, some will double, some even more. I think the biggest opportunity with this fork is being able to buy into some very promising alts at very low sat levels. BTW: When looking at alts focus on the sats not the price. Compare the sat levels now and what they where when Bitcoin was at $4,000 you will find many of them are now at the same sats they were back then. But because the current BTC price has risen the alt prices remain similar to what they were, so this can be misleading for newcomers.

@_date: 2017-11-06 21:18:54
You said: It makes little sense to regard them (Bitcojn/fiat) as different assets. But I have to disagree. As soon as you convert fiat into Bitcoin, you now have a volatile but generally appreciating asset. In 2010 if I had $200 of fiat in my bank account and I spent $100 on Bitcoin and just held onto to both. Fast forward to 2017, I now have a multimillion dollar Bitcoin stash and $100 stash of fiat.
So getting back to the original premise. Bitcoin, or any other crypto for that matter, that is appreciating over time is simply too valuable to use for daily purchases.

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:42:47
Exactly. But you must be very careful which crypto you trade into and when. There are sweet spots when almost every crypto falls or dips for a while, thats the time to buy. I find many cryptos fall when  its late at night over Western Europe. Very important..give yourself plenty of time to study before you invest. A heads up...at the moment Neo and Gas are two cryptos which could very well double or more after the fork. I would be investing in those when you see a generous dip. Look at BQX Bitquence and WTC Walton also. Invest in cryptos that have a real world application. Because when wall street comes they will focus on cryptos like that.

Satoshi created Bitcoin from a number of other digital cash ideas that had been floating around. He consolidated the ideas into one very clever package and called it Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was created after the 2007-2008 financial crisis as protection against financial loss the next time a crisis occurs. It was created by an Australian programmer/hacker/mathematician and two other contributors both of which I believe have passed away. So these days Satoshi is Australian Dr Craig S Wright but not everyone believes that. Over the years Bitcoin appreciated in value greatly so no one really wanted to spend it on buying the groceries or a cup of coffee so it became a store-of-value first and a currency second. It's going through some major changes right now so its slow and expensive but this should improve greatly by early next year. The real value of Bitcoin is it's underlying technology that combines cryptography and distributed ledger system.

"With considerable research"
For example: After considerable research I invested 0.35 BTC into Power Ledger POWR when it was 0.00004115 last week. When it doubled up I sold. That 0.35 BTC was turned into 0.7 BTC. Even though they wont have a blockchain till 2019, the research told me that other investors will look at the real world use, the government investment, the credible and highly skilled team behind POWR as being something other investors will find attractive.

The main contributor to the Bitcoin code was Craig Wright.
Assisting him was at least two other people. Both I believe have since passed away. Together they are/were Satoshi.
Craig is a brilliant man, a self proclaimed mathematician, C++ programmer, IT security expert and well versed in accounting and economics. In his earlier years he was a hacker and so conversant in ways to hide his identity and location. His personality has not made him a popular man, he is abrupt, highly outspoken and offensive at times. He also mixes fact with fiction, exaggerates and big notes himself. He likes to play games and make up childish stories. Since 2009 the Bitcoin community has grown to almost idolise Satoshi, they view him as a talented and rational developer of the highest order. They also perceive Satoshi as a humble and polite gentleman with a generous disposition. Craig does not come across 'Satoshi like' so Craig has been rejected and now wears the title of faux satoshi

The more powerful ASIC based units are manufactured in China by Bitmain. They are called Antminers. Bitmain also operate vast mining pools (Antpool) that utilise their own hardware to mine Bitcoin/litecoin/Bitcoin Cash etc. Bitmain is also a major dark investor behind Bitcoin Cash. Not sure how you would invest in them. Some people might say (tongue in cheek) if you invest into Bitcoin Cash you are investing in Bitmain :)

We can't argue about economic fundamentals, they are what they are. Most people currently use Bitcoin to buy other appreciating assets and to trade it for altcoins. They won't use it for day to day purchases because its too valuable to do so. Using Bitcoin for day to day purchases equals a loss in future returns from Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-20 02:49:48
I think the head preacher at the Church of Ver-atology has a lot to answer for, as the majority of the misleading and inaccurate propaganda stem's from his neck of the woods. Satoshi's vision, Scaling, r/bitcoin censorship all the same old tired arguments are repeated over and over and it's no wonder why some people get sucked in and believe it all.
As you so elequently demonstrated, Satoshi's vision was just the start and progress was to follow. He gave us the code and said here, now go play, and we did. So far it's been working out just fine. However as we all know there is a problem with network capacity - transaction speed and fees. At the start of the year BTC was $1000 and now its $8000. Thats a big increase and this attracted more adoption and more transactions came with it. However we now have Segwit and if the majority of the miners adopted it there would be lower fees and faster transactions. But no, Jihan Wu doesn't like Segwit because he will loose money and ASICBOOST is not compatible with Segwit. So the problem with scaling right now is not due to the code it's mainly due to miner adoption. 
In 2015 Roger's arguments may have had some merit, but in 2017 all of Rogers arguments are baseless and amount to just propaganda, all designed to indoctrinate noobs and the easily led into the realm of core hatred.
1. Bitcoin has a scaling solution, Seqwit, and whilst the block size is kept at 1MB the block weight is reduced, which solves (for now) the scaling issue.
2. Fees will reduce and speeds will improve when the miners get with the program - Segwit
3. The r/bitcoin censorship issue, hardly Bitcoins fault, don't like the forum, go and make your own
Bcash thinks that they are the real Bitcoin now, but they only have part of the code but none of the trust and confidence that Bitcoin has. They tried to topple Bitcoin and used every dirty trick at their disposal to do so, but failed.
So one would hope this is the end, they will now lick their wounds and stop the BS, clean up their backyard and get on with the job of repairing their image and increasing adoption.

It is an attack when Jihan Wu (a member and financial sponsor of Bitcoin Unlimited) and his associates collude to move hashing power towards BCH at times when mining BCH is less profitable. All of which coincided with BTC being spammed and BCH being pumped. That's a lot of coincidences .. more than any reasonable person would accept

Short term not a lot, apart from raising awareness and boycotting anything BCH including Bitmain/Antminers. I had BCH and now I've sold it this afternoon and will never purchase it again under any circumstances.  Long term.. working towards more decentralised mining so we take the balance of power away from the Chinese mining cartels.  One of the problems the BTC community has is we don't have a high profile spokesperson, BCH can say anything they like and there are few high profile people on our side standing up and rebutting their ridiculous claims.

I'm suggesting currency B should be one that is relatively price stable.
Most of us have stash of Bitcoin and we use it primarily to purchase other crypto in the dips and sell back into Bitcoin in the peaks. That way we increase the amount of Bitcoin we have. If we just left our stash of Bitcoin and came back in Nov 2018 chances its value would have appreciated greatly.  But what if in the meantime we wanted to spend some of our Bitcoin, problem is the more we removed from the stash the less profit over time we would have made. Now lets take a more sensible approach. With a portion of our Bitcoin lets purchase a more price stable crypto, like litecoin and purchase say 10 x litecoin. During the year between now and nov 2018 we use the litecoin for day to day purchases, instead of our Bitcoin. By taking this approach we would have minimised our potential losses.

Pump is a generic term. When BTC pumps it's a very different beast The BCH pump had my charts going vertical..never seen that before, neve seen such volume be moved into a coin so quickly. The overwhelming view of the crypto-community was it was being pumped by BCH backers (most are VERY wealthy people) or the chinese miners. Here is the kicker. The majority of the volume going into BCH was through Bithumb, a Sth Korean exchange and the peak time for the pump was 4 AM Korean time.

Bitcoin or any other crypto that appreciates in value is NOT a good currency, and adoption will be never go mainstream for that reason alone. It's just too valuable. If in the future Bitcoins value become stable, transactions become faster and cheaper THEN and only then will Bitcoin become a currency people will want to use.

I think you have focussed on the hypotheticals too much and missed the point in the process. There is nothing to get through to me about. It's not my opinion per se, it's common sense. That any rational person will not spend an appreciating asset on day to day purchases, of which most would be depreciating assets or consumables. This is the fundamental reason why bitcoin has not become a day to day currency. Please think on this a bit more, I'm sure in time you will see the point

Bitcoins beauty comes from its utility and portability. 
Its utility is not just 'Bitcoin the currency' but 'Bitcoin the most secure blockchain'

All of which add value.

100% disagree with your assertion that it was OK for one group to fork off and create BCH because they didn't agree with BTC's small block size.  I saw it as a bloody disaster and could have been avoided if BTC had leadership. We didn't listen to the community, and yet Bitcoin is a community project. 
Leadership in open source projects is not the same as leadership in the business world. Many of the most successful open source projects had leadership. Leadership does not infer centralisation. A single point of failure occurs when you have ONE leader. Bitcoin needs leadership not A leader.
Bitcoin is no longer the domain of the computer nerd, its evolved, global adoption is now possible but it needs direction, leadership and a roadmap. It will not succeed without leadership, of that I am 100% sure. 
Edit: Leadership- open source projects

Top post! You mentioned something few are talking about, people selling their BTC to fund their Xmas holidays.
It’s normal to see a dip at this time of year and throughout Dec and much of Jan also.
Of course the main cause of the dip is the idiotic Hash war and the BTC sell off to fund it. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:01:37
I would argue that the lack of leadership is one of the main reasons why we ended up having a BCH fork. Why we had massive division within the BTC community over the block size.
Blockstream are in a sense acting as benevolent dictators, helping to fund development, but who is actively marketing Bitcoin the currency, seeking new markets..hustling up business? No one apart from some selfless individuals that truly believe in Bitcoin. But that is not going to be enough.
Meanwhile other projects that have leadership and marketing teams are gaining traction and are now more likely to reach mass adoption well before Bitcoin ever does.  Leadership is not necessarily a point of failure, it can be a point of incredible success. 
Leadership done right is what Bitcoin needs or it will be left well behind.

You said nothing is hacker proof, so far Bitcoin has proved to be hacker proof, its hacker proof because its a work in progress.  If a vulnerability is detected in the future I am sure the core developers will act fast to patch any holes, just as they have done since 2009.

This is just bullshit. A few months ago the fees were 'temporarily' ridiculous for some very obvious reasons, but fundamentally Bitcoin had not changed and you of all people should know that. Now those reasons have all but vanished and Bitcoin transactions are quite reasonable again. The harsh view you had on Bcash was because of the deceptive anti-Bitcoin propaganda, the miner collusion and other dodgy practises that the boys at Bcash were up to. Now you have changed your mind and suddenly Bcash is OK??  Bullshit, absolute pure bullshit

This should be a sticky, it would be very useful for newcomers to read the comments within this thread. In particular theiflar's comment.  Its about time we ALL stand up for Bitcoin and the core developers, we can't allow these idiots to continue with their BS propaganda offensive.  Its all lies, deception and distortions all designed to further their agenda.  
People need to realise what is really going on, sure we had the scaling debate and many people didn't like the outcome but at the moment Bitcoin is doing OK, there is a lot to be positive about. But to blame the core developers or blockstream for what they call 'censorship' in an online forum is ridiculous and absolutely false, it's a lie and they know it.

@_date: 2018-03-24 20:45:25
I think there is an assumption that the consensus amongst the Bitcoin developers will not change and the status quo will continue, and that Bitcoin will not scale by increasing its block size. During the scaling debate most core developers supported the idea of increasing the block size when it was needed.  I do not believe on chain scaling will not happen for Bitcoin. 
Yes, presently crypto is like a gift card that changes value day to day, a true currency needs to be stable and without stability crypto is better used as a token than a currency.

BCH like any fork of Bitcoin is entitled to exist and create its own use case and compete. In that sense I have no issue with BCH and I have owned it myself until recently.  It's the main promoters that have ruined BCH as far as I am concerned and destroyed its reputation and turned it into a blockchain designed to be of most benefit to the larger mining operations, most of which are actually owned by the same promoters.

**You are right** 
But your description also applies to 99.99% of all other crypto-currencies.  The truth is most of us got into Bitcoin based on historical gains and we wanted some of that.  The other's got into Bitcoin because they thought Bitcoin would change the world, replace major fiat currencies and some even thought it could stop wars.  None of which is true, it's not going to happen. 
No volatile crypto-currency based on a public blockchain will ever replace fiat currency.  Only a government issued crypto-currency, one that is designed to be price stable can/will take the place of a fiat notes. China and other countries are working on this right now.
Bitcoin is a store of value, a commodity and a currency, more so now with Lightning, but it will never permanently replace fiat currency, however it will/is useful as a temp solution in countries with hyper-inflation.  Bitcoin is relevant and has use cases, but replacing official fiat currencies is not one of them.
I'll admit, I got into Bitcoin to make money [the crowd boos/hisses] but I have since seen that Bitcoin is more than just that. Dreams of Bitcoin going mainstream and becoming a world wide currency is just that, a dream.   Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, I'm bullish on Bitcoin but I'm also a realist

It wasn't part of his vision to collude with the major Chinese owned mining operations, or allow SBI Bits (owns banks) invest directly into the network. 
Satoshi's vision is still alive and well within Bitcoin. Satoshi was all for increasing Bitcoins utility. I'm sure off chain solutions would have had his full approval.
I have no issue with BCH, but I detest what its main promotors (Ver, Wright Ayre etc) have done and are doing. These people are operating a long con, they are the ones that will profit the most out of BCH becoming successful. They all own BCH mining operations so more traffic more riches for them. These people are very clever, they know how to create and use propaganda and twist the truth to their benefit.

If it was confirmed that Wright was Satoshi or part of 'team Satoshi' I doubt little would change. Personally I would not be surprised or impressed. 
Satoshi put Bitcoin together from a bunch of ideas that others had invented before him. Satoshi was/is a systems integrator and a problem solver and I can see those traits in Wright also, so I would not be surprised if he was Satoshi.  Wright is an impressive man in terms of his knowledge, concepts and insights but he is not an honest business man and he has some deep character flaws which makes him untrustworthy.  It is hard to know when Wright is being genuine as it seems there is always an ulterior motive to everything he does.

Your first response is spot on, the second not so. Blockstream was originally formed to assist the core developers with much needed funding and guidance because both were in VERY short supply. Off-chain was already a path the core developers had decided upon decided. To attract VC funding Blockstream focussed on developing private (business) side chains. Which is something the core developers found as being appropriate since they have more than enough work to do with Bitcoin itself.  Their vision was clear and open and the core developers were fine with it, yet some people screamed conspiracy. Mainly because it suited their agenda. So yes Blockstream is up to something, but its nothing sinister or out of bounds.

Now we have lightning its use cases and adoption will increase but at the end of the day most of us are simply exchanging fiat for Bitcoin and Bitcoin is being exchanged back to fiat again.

I think there are three possibilities. 
1. Craig knew who the real Satoshi was and that Satoshi has passed away or Satoshi has given Craig full rights to assume the identity 
2. Craig paid the 2014 satashin hacker for the password and copied all of the real Satoshi's information from the account.
3. Craig is/was part of the Satoshi team, he is the real deal.
(But this does not whiten him, he is still a bad actor in this space)
No doubt Craig knows a lot about Bitcoin, he is brilliant guy, but his character is deeply flawed. Not a person to be trusted. 
If he is 'Satoshi' he has already contravened many of his original Bitcoin statutes.
@_date: 2018-03-25 09:14:12
This is true, but what is the point of the game when all we do is exchange fiat for a volatile crypto (and incur a charge) so we can purchase goods or services from a vendor who then exchanges the crypto back to fiat again. It's all rather pointless. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:04:35
The BTC roadmap is one of evolution and innovation without sacrificing security. These tenants have not changed and they keep Bitcoin on track to this day. Sure there were a few months when Bitcoin transaction fees went through the roof, that was unfortunate, but it was just a blimp on the radar when looked at in a historical sense.  Bitcoin has evolved into a store of value, it wasn't pushed in that direction, however it has been allowed to take on that shape. Which is good, Bitcoin should be a store of value and a currency for the internet. Mainstream adoption is a rather pointless and erroneous mission, although some people just don't realise that and continue to fool themselves into thinking mainstream adoption is some kind of noble crusade. Think about it, when we purchase goods or services what are we actually doing? We are using fiat from a bank to purchase crypto then we exchange crypto for goods or services and the merchant then exchanges the crypto for fiat. The merchant then deposits the crypto into their business bank account and pays tax on the profit made in fiat. The winners here are only the miners.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:10:12
If Craig is a fraud he must know there is no possibility for the truth to ever get out. Which means the real satoshi is dead or he has paid him off to assume the Satoshi identity.  I know of Craigs family and they are fully behind him, they believe him 100%. If Craig is a fraud he is risking the adoration and trust of his family along with the ruination of his public and academic life.
If Craig is a fraud and the real Satoshi is still out there then its bizarre that he hasn't taken any steps to stop Craig in his tracks..somehow. Either Satoshi is dead, paid off or Craig is/was part of the Satoshi team. 
I think it's likely that Craig is part of the Satoshi team and if you follow that line, remove any preconceptions and analyse the information at hand it becomes quite probable. Most of us don't think Craig is Satoshi because his personality and character doesn't fit the preconception we have of Satoshi. But that preconception comes from the white-paper, the emails and forums posts. What if Craig wasn't the behind the Satoshi keyboard? Then we have to consider our preconceptions of Satoshi are no longer relevant. 
I'm Australian also and have access to many off-line databases and information sources that cannot be found on the net, from my amateur (ish) investigations its clear Craig has been heavily into Bitcoin from the beginning. I think its more likely he was part of this than not. But Craigs dodgy personality and character is not what we expect of Satoshi, thats the big hurdle that must be overcome before anyone could consider the possibility that Craig is part of the Satoshi team. 
Just an opinion.. I really do not know, but I think there are few possibilities left who is the real Satoshi, but there is no denying Craig is involved one way or another.

What are the chances that within the very small town of Temple City population 36,000 where Hal resided was a man called Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal just happened to be corresponding with a Satoshi Nakamoto online regarding Bitcoin. 
I don't believe Dorian is Satoshi. But it seems Hal was part of the group behind Bitcoin. Together the group is Satoshi, individually they are just themselves, so when Hal was asked "are you Satoshi" he could honestly reply no, I am not Satoshi. 
My guess is Hal remembered Dorians name from his interactions when he was a student, it stuck in his head so when the time came for a catchy name for the group Dorians name came to mind.

The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced today that Roger Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for selling explosives on the online auction site, eBay. The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel following a guilty plea on one count of dealing in explosives without a license in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 842(a)(1); one count of illegally storing explosives in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 842(j); and one count of mailing injurious articles in violation Title 18, United States Code, Section 1716. Mr. Ver, 22, of San Jose, was charged in an information filed in federal district court on August 8, 2001. According to the plea agreement, Mr. Ver admitted to engaging in the business of selling explosives without a license from January 1999 through August 2000. According to the information and plea agreement, Mr. Ver sold explosive devices described as "Pest Control Report 2000" on the online auction site eBay. He purchased approximately 49 pounds of the devices from a supplier in South Carolina, and sold at least 14 pounds of the devices to bidders on eBay. While engaging in the business of selling explosive devices, Mr. Ver stored the explosives in a residential apartment building and mailed the devices via the United States Mail in a manner contrary to Postal Service regulations. Judge Fogel sentenced the Defendant to 10 months in federal prison, a fine of $2,000, as well as a three-year period of supervised release. The Defendant will begin serving the sentence on August 2, 2002. The prosecution was the result of an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Scott Frewing is the Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted the case with the assistance of Legal Assistant Lauri Gomez.

I dislike the guy as much as you do and I'm not a believer, I'm just following the information on hand where it leads me and weighing up the probabilities and possibilities.  I think for any sane/rational person the risk factor of faking Satoshi would be far too high to gamble on. So perhaps there is another possibility, Craig is mentally unwell and is risking everything on this fantasy. His family members are all quite successful in their business lives and one can be seen on TV here in Australia on the odd occasion, perhaps within his fantasy he too wants to be 'famous' 
I've been looking for the smoking gun to prove or disprove and have come up short. Certainly there is plenty of evidence to show Craig is not a straight shooter, he lies, contradicts himself and even tried to scam Australian tax payers through the AusIndustry R&amp;D tax incentive scheme. His business's and business dealings have all but failed or been shut down and he has a loooong list of angry creditors that lost a lot of money from his mis-managed business's. One document from the ASIC shows many pages of creditors most were involved in the building trade.. indicating he built something very large (home/business) and didn't pay anyone.
Yes, I'm happy to share whatever you or anyone wants, some info has been paid for on the basis of confidentiality .. so I cannot post those documents but I can allude to its contents :) 
Yes, you are right there is no online evidence of Craig discussing Bitcoin online before 2011, nothing I can find off-line also.

Craig is not the master of Bitcoin, I think Nick Szabo is the master, or one the masters at least. (Although his idea of transmitting the blockchain via the ionosphere was a bit up there with the fairies) 
Craig is not a genius, thats for sure, but I do think he is brilliant in his own right. Craigs achilles heal is his shitty personality and his inability to communicate clearly.

0.042 and UNDER. No, at the moment LN alone will not significantly reduce on chain transactions. At the moment along with Segwit it will help. However in the future LN will play a significant role when it comes to its target market, that is retail POS, in which case as adoption increases and more and more POS terminals accept and use BTC it will make a very large impact on reducing on-chain transactions.

But the risk/reward is not in his favour if Satoshi is alive and then calls him out mid scam. So perhaps he knows or thinks Satoshi is dead, perhaps he thinks Hal was Satoshi. If he knew Satoshi was dead and had access to Satoshi's keys and info then the risk/reward ratio leans heavily in his favour. 
The things that matter the most to CSW are the things he says he doesn't want.. fame, money and power. On a personal level CSW is VERY 
concerned and protective of his family, what they think of him means a lot to him. I find it difficult to believe he would risk the adoration of his family by creating a scam that has a low risk/reward ratio. A scam in which he could easily get call out on.  So if its a scam then he knows Satoshi is dead or perhaps Satoshi has given him the rights to assume his identity.
Or he is Satoshi or part of the team and Craig is just Craig, a brilliant guy with a shitty personality.
In which case what was the purpose of Bitcoin? Part of a long term money making scheme?
That would be my best guest.
I don't know if he is or is not Satoshi.. but I'd like to know!

Bitcoin is valuable because it's a means of exchange for other cryptos. It was the first so the network effect has had time to grow and consolidate. Its also a currency but not a very good one at the moment, LN will help change that. Because its appreciated in value its become a store-of-value and people have decided to hoard more than spend and this has help drive the value up. There are many other smaller factors that have contributed to Bitcoins value
Bitcoin will increase in value over time because of the above factors and also because off-chain solutions will provide Bitcoin with more use cases, particularly in the business and finance sectors. LN will allow Bitcoin to become a useable currency in third world countries, countries that have hyper-inflation and also POS retail worldwide (Hopefully)
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:07:35
He wont be able to wiggle out of it as far as his family is concerned, he has got them 100% convinced. He is on record on British TV stating he is Satoshi or part of the team. He also has a lot of close confidants/friends convinced. Trust me the thing he cares most about is his family and their opinion of him. If a scam he must be 100% sure he wont get caught out, which would mean Satoshi gave him full rights (for a cash payment I would presume) or Satoshi is dead and he got hold of his keys/info by hacking or by paying a hacker. 
He has Ian Griggs, Stefan Matthews, JVP and a host of other people backing his story stating they knew about or saw the white paper well before its release.  Ian Griggs, whom I know of, is a bit out there but a brilliant guy and not likely to risk his world renown reputation by making up BS about CSW.  Even though I wish it wasn't true I can't ignore that ALL evidence considered CSW must be in there somewhere..

You must be new here, its been discussed off and on for years, I recall a large thread about it as early as 2012 on Bitcointalk.. 
But on that subject, yes he was a public figure for Bitcoin but when no one listened to him ranting and raving on scaling he spat the dummy and supported XT, Classic, BU and anything that wasn't the core client. So when he did the switch-a-roo and backflipped on Bitcoin then a lot of people did a switch-a-roo on Roger.  Seems fair enough, right?
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:48:19
**What has already be 100% confirmed is CSW is a scammer and committed a crime**
The BTC addresses that he claimed were his and placed in a trust were proven to be Mt Gox cold storage wallet addresses. So he attempted to defraud the Australian Tax Office, a criminal offence. 
This suit will probably not be successful but it will force CSW to admit that he produced false documents and committed a crime, in which case the Australian Federal Police will issue a warrant on behalf of the ATO.
It will also highlight in a very public way just how untrustworthy this serial liar really is.
Sure he is a smart guy, quite brilliant in fact but so are most sociopathic criminals.

I'm of the mind not to dismiss or rule out anything from the equation. We know "Satoshi' from his emails, posts and the white-paper but was that Satoshi at the keyboard? Many people have formed an opinion, a preconception about the character of Satoshi from his texts, I think the best thing we can do is to delete all preconceptions so it doesn't lead us astray. 
I think there is enough evidence out there to make an informed decision as to who Satoshi is or was without cryptographic proof.  CSW rates highly on the 'possibles' list but so does the duo of Hal Finney and Nick Szabo.
And where does Wei Dai figure in all of this, he seems to be visibly absent from the hunt for Satoshi.
CSW has the technical capability and a shitty enough character to try to pull it off.  He has the scamming and hacking background and a supercomputer that he could have used to mine Bitcoins or hack to get the info he needed. 
Timeline wise it seems JVP was one of the first to encounter CSW (2005) in which he claimed CSW told him he was designing a digital currency platform authored under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. This and Ian Griggs testimony are the two testimonies that appear quite credible. Both JVP and Ian are oddballs in their own right which may or may not be significant. There is always the possibility they considered CSW as 'god like' in his perceived abilities so could their adoration cloud their judgement? Could they become protective enough to lie or stretch the truth to cover for their guy?  
Perhaps JVP's account needs to be carefully tested to see if there are any holes in his story.

In my case its very easy, in fact it's no harder than using a tap and go debit card. I can purchase any item (indirectly) with BTC anywhere, anytime.  Thats sounds like BS I know but I'm fortunate to live in a country with a unique service that enable this.
First you have to come to grips with whats really happening when you buy something with BTC.  The process is really quite pointless because at the moment we cannot use BTC natively, there is always a conversion process involved in every transaction.
The normal process:
1. You use fiat to purchase BTC  
2. You give BTC to vendor to purchase goods
3. The vendor or a payment processor exchanges BTC for fiat
So why not just send you BTC to a service which can credit your fiat debit card and use the card to purchase anything, anywhere.
Seems like sacrilege to use BTC in this way, but the sad fact is we cannot spend BTC natively until BTC completely replaces a national currency .. and who knows when and if that will happen, so in the meantime we have to be content with the fiat&gt;BTC&gt;fiat conversion process which almost always operates at both ends of every retail transaction.

When you want to spend your Bitcoin and you go to your local store to purchase the latest MacBook Pro how do you suppose that store will handle the 0.5 BTC you give them? Keep in mind they paid for the stock in $, pay their taxes in $ and need to pay their staff in $. At some point the BTC needs to turned into $. That will most likely be performed by a service like Bitpay or the likes of Square
So that is the reality now. However at sometime in the future perhaps BTC will replace $, at that point BTC can be earned and spent natively.

Calm down, whats the commotion all about? Yes, we all know what the white-paper says but it's just the primer. Satoshi's emails and forum posts are just as important, if not more so. 
Here is where reality comes into play, you cannot (at this stage) do away without a payment processor or some form of crypto to fiat conversion at the retail end. 
Square like any other payment processor is optional, you can use it or not.
If you want to use Bitcoin and send it to your peers, do so, no one forces anyone how to use Bitcoin or any other crypto.

"Merchants that accept BTC should keep BTC" The reality is very very few do. What you want merchants to do is a long way off. A very long way off into the future. 
Your use case is very rare, it's exceedingly hard for 95% of use to follow suit.
The fact is if you had entered the Bitcoin world in December 2017 (and not 2015) the BTC savings from your salary would be worth less than half right now. That is not acceptable, a viable crypto-currency for the masses must be relatively price stable. You are lucky that Bitcoin has increased in value since 2015, it could have stalled and gone backwards.  Keep in mind for your employer to pay you, they must convert $ to BTC and for 90% of the merchants you deal with they also have to convert BTC to $. Whilst you can manage to use BTC for day to day spending there is always a $ - BTC - $ conversion going on in the background, therefore BTC is not being used natively. 
Like you I can also spend my BTC for day to day purchases, but unlike you I do so in a totally unrestricted manner, I can spend it anywhere and everywhere. But I convert BTC - $ and then charge up my debit card, I do this because I am resigned to the fact that at this point if I want to spend BTC there will always be a conversion going on, so I may as well perform that conversion.

Nonsense, it's no different, if you want to make purchase from a retailer they will most probably use a payment processor or convert the crypto to fiat him/herself. Besides hasn't CSW done a deal with SBI bits, a financial institution, one that owns banks and is currently getting involved in the BCH Giggleblock network and also mining BCH. IS that inline with the real definition of Bitcoin? No way Jose!
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:38:07
I think at the time the developers felt Bitcoin was under threat, they had security and centralisation concerns, so the safe option was to first try to scale using Segwit (block weight) and of course Lightning. All of which was a good idea I thought, and still is a good idea. Segwit adoption is increasing, Lighting network is becoming larger and I think 'in time' Bitcoin can scale to a large degree by these means, but still at some point a block size increase will be needed. 
But I see a storm looming and Bitcoin needs to be ready, there is a very good chance we will see another large, but this time sustained, influx of institutional and traditional investors that want to use Bitcoin as a safe haven, a store of value, if that comes within the next few months then it could be a disaster for Bitcoin as the protocol in its current state is not ready for such an event.  I'm deeply concerned about this, but perhaps it may not happen and Bitcoin is provided with more time to scale off-chain with Lightning, all I can say is..I hope I am wrong.

Luke is a smart guy, has contributed a lot of good ideas and code... but this idea is not one of his best.   I have seen and understand his reasons for wanting this and tend to agree but lowering the blocksize before we scale off chain will effectively kill Bitcoin come the next bull run, it’s economic suicide. Do we really want to see $50+ fees again?
Luke wants to contain the blockchain size as much as possible and scale off chain.  I think he is right, we should contain the blockchain size that is crucial going forward. But we should scale on chain and off chain.
Bitcoin NEEDS a moderate blocksize increase, and right now.  I would be very surprised if the other developers support Luke’s proposal. 
Sorry Luke this is a fail

My guess is more landlords would accept Bitcoin if they had more 'confidence' in Bitcoin and its stability and also if the tax implications were well understood.

Politically, because the community consensus is we scale on-chain to keep fees low. Economically, because Bitcoin needs to cope with the volume of transactions the next wave of new adopters/investors will bring. We don't want $50 fees ever again, right?  If the user experience is slow and expensive they will choose to use another crypto-currency.  There needs to be a compromise. I think a BIP involving 8MB blocks and 2 min block times would be the best compromise and would have massive community/miner support.

Yes, very true, good points.


That reminded me, I have a friend a few kilometres away that lives in a rural area (deep valley) and has no telephone/ADSL connected. He receives TV and Internet through a rather large Ku parabolic dish.. its bi-directional.  In my country, Australia, there are thousands of similar bi-directional TV/Internet satellite installations. But these are almost always stationary and so moving them to a satellite that hosts your stream would be problematic. 
I think there is merit in this system and I like the censorship free aspect, you have obviously put a great deal of time and effort in getting this up and you wouldn't do it if there was no huge advantage to be gained. I can only assume there is some masterplan to it all and no doubt you will release information about it when the time is right.  I don't mean some Dr Evil masterplan :)  Anyway thanks for your reply, keep up the good work!

Open source decentralised projects that rely on consensus to move forward often progress at a slow rate.  So tech developments evolve slowly, surely and (usually) carefully.  Keep in mind the vast majority of the developers donate their time to help Bitcoin whilst also holding down a full time job.  But lets look at what we have now.. a very secure Blockchain, solutions such as Segwit and C-Lightning!  All awesome tech that is grossly under-rated and under-appreciated.

And what is your perspective Kwai Chang Caine?

What Bitcoin really needs right now is a 'moderate' block size increase to say 8MB.  We need to be ready for the next influx of adopters, and this may come very soon if the US economy keeps on heading towards a recession.. We all saw what happened during December 17, if that was sustained it would have been devastating for Bitcoin, luckily it wasn't sustained. That was the warning bell, the next wave of adoption could be larger and more sustained so Bitcoin needs a game plan to cope with this.. Lightning is not ready for mass adoption at this time so what other option do we have but to increase the block size.

Seems you haven't been paying attention of late.. the economy is on the brink, interest rate hike incoming, S&amp;P 500  etc going down currency devaluation will follow .. institutional investors will go for Bitcoin because its already down and gold has already peaked. The bottom line.. buy Bitcoin and buy it quickly.

I think we need investors/speculators, they are part of the adoption process. Once Bitcoins price rises and stabilises it will become more useful for day to day payments and less useful to speculators.

The point is this.. The Lightning network provides Blockstream with no commercial advantage, no profit stream, nothing. ZERO. So why did they assist in the Bitcoin implimentation of the LN? 
The much maligned, misunderstood and rediculed Blockstream has done no harm to Bitcoin, it has worked to support and protect, but not control. Meanwhile it continues to create solutions and provide important commercial use cases. Its a win-win for all concerned.

An exchange is a trusted-third-party, that is precisely why they cannot be trusted with our Bitcoins.

You are technically incorrect, but you are entitled to your opinion, right or wrong

When the economy is on the brink institutional investors will reach out for a variety of investments.. Some will be a store of value, like gold, some low yield but stable and some highly speculative... enter Bitcoin.

Hey, what I do with my my Bitcoin is my business!

Blockstream does not control Bitcoin development.  No one person or company controls Bitcoin.  Blockstream create side chains for commercial clients, thats how they make money.  Lightning is not a Blockstream creation, it was in development before Blockstream was established. Blockstream helped adapt Lightning to the Bitcoin network, they did not make money from that, Lightning is not a product of Blockstream, it is not monetised for Blockstream. These are facts that you can prove for yourself  with some research.
Blockstream have stated publicly that they are not against a level of on-chain scaling, but they cannot control wether Bitcoin scales on-chain or not and if Bitcoin scales on-chain it will not harm Blockstream's business.
Scaling for worldwide adoption on-chain is foolish, for a variety of technical and logical reasons. Period.

Vendors and payment processors converting to FIAT is to be expected and it doesn't hurt Bitcoin per se.
There isn't enough stability and confidence for them to save at this point, but that will come in time. (I hope)

I want to try to understand the importance of this, but I can't get past the fact this is downlink or receive only, there is no ability to upload a transaction onto the blockchain via satellite.  Therefore the applications and advantages are limited.
But I do see this an an interesting 'option' for mining farms, enterprise users and to a lesser extent Bitcoin enthusiasts.

$20K was an all time high so its logical to assume that is the level we must reach again for confidence to also be at an all time high.

I think the block size is small enough, going smaller won't achieve very much. I agree we do need to do more with less. Decreasing the block times to 2 mins would be a positive move forward.. 8MB blocks and 2 min block times would be a massive leg up for Bitcoin and would satisfy community consensus and promote greater adoption

Thats why you should do your own research and not rely on what you read in threads.
