The lightning network could be "k-vertex-connected":
This means that the removal of k (say 5) nodes maintains the network 100% connected.
In the immediate, someone could run and publish a list of suggested connection for all nodes.
In the future, a node should be able to start with a "help decentralize network" option, that will a) analyze the current network topology and b) connected to the best selected k nodes

Indeed, assuming a smart hacker has discovered a critical bug allowing her to steal the fund, she will be faced with two options:
- Wait until more funds are available to steal
- Steal ASAP, knowing that either the bug could be fixed, or another hacker may have found the same flaw.
Let us suppose that 100 BTC is "life changing". I would bet that if we pass this level accross all channels, without theft, then the protocol itself is pretty safe.
If, in addition, we pass the threshold for all channels of a single implementation (say, eclair), then eclair is pretty safe.
We'll get there soon enough it seems, so let's see what happens next.

What could be useful, though, is a *certification* of some sort, covering segregation of accounts, insurances, IT info. security,  proof of reserves, audits/accounting, etc.

Correct, which why we see savings rates increasing in several countries at this point.
However, if your $100 today were worth $20 tomorrow, you'll run to the nearest shop to buy food, cigarettes, alcohol &amp; amo, so there is a "tipping point" beyong which inflation becomes hyperinflation and changes behavioral patterns.  We are not there (yet) in most western countries, but it is coming, courtesy of math.

Right, but before bitcoin the "assets that appreciate over time" were risky.

Not quite.  
a) Remember, we are discussing what will happen in case Bitcoin is mainstream.  Then you are looking at a situation where your savings are worth more tomorrow than they are today. The opposite of today if you wish.
b) Renting vs Buying is a highly complex topic, which doesn't have such a clear "Buying is better" answer. In the area I live, I would say it is cheaper to rent than to buy, all factors included.
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:05:26
No, it benefits the rich for two reasons.
The first one is explained in the article.
The second reason is that when money is printed, it is made available to banks and corporations before it trickles down to the rest of the population.  Hence, banks and corporations can purchase assets cheaper than the rest, that is, before said printing inflates the price of these assets.

Wrong.  We have been able to do that since 1924.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:27:44
It is unclear whether this refers to coins that had the same nominal value.  Also, it is incomplete.
The Denarius was introduced in 211 BC with a silver content of 95-98%.  It lasted until 274 AD, at which point it was coined with 48% silver content following centuries of debasement.
That is, roughly 50% loss of value in 485 years.
This is WAY better than any fiat currency. 
A mathematically inclined redditor could compute the implied rate of inflation. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:17:38
Not so sure about that.  
That assumes that producing goods, for example is "cost constant".  That would ultimately depend on what type of goods is being considered. Some of them may require more energy to produce over time, etc. etc..  So I would not necessarily draw the overly simplistic conclusion that in a BTC world, purchase prices would decrease over time.  
Also, I am not sure of costs of services.  Would be interesting to read what economists have to say about this.  r/stiglitz are you there?

@_date: 2018-08-22 15:50:00
No clue what you are doing here if you believe that Bitcoin is a toxic asset.
Anyway, another indicator of the significant overvaluation of the stock market is the P/E ratio, which is currently at about 25 whereas the median/mean is about 15.  A reversal to the mean for that indicator would also point to a 60% drop after stabilization.  A temporary 80% drop cannot be excluded.

Right.  This will stop when the expected return on the stock market will be lower than the inflation rate, which is only a matter of time.  
At which point stocks will be liquidated abruptly for safe heaven assets (i.e. Gold, Bitcoin). Accordingly, expect fake data on the stock market performance and on the the real inflation rate.

I don't think that you need to trust the developers of core per se.
For example, we could have a pruned chain signed by people with a stake (ie BTC owner) in the project. If sufficient amount of stakeholders agree that a pruned chain is genuine, then it forms the new baseline.
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:23:14

"Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks, and applying the relevant factors, we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA, but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations."

@_date: 2018-08-22 11:35:58
To estimate a crash, one could take a stable base year (tricky), and apply historical return of, say, 6% per year to the Dow Jones.
So, let's say we start with 1000 USD for the DJI in 1980, that would give us ca 10000 USD, or a 15000 USD drop expected compared to today.  
So maybe a 60% drop is more realistic?
Of course, historical returns may not be indicative of future returns, base year choice is subjective etc. etc.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:58:26
Unless you download the code from github, review every single line, then compile it, you have zero assurance that the code performs as you expect.
So I repeat my question: why trust the software but not a signed, verified, pruned chain?
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:15:49
Yes, pruning has been available for a while, but still requires you to download the full chain (only the pruned version is stored locally).
What I am wondering is the following: wouldn't there be a way to download an agreed pruned chain instead of the full chain ?
That would allow to start running immediately, without having to wait for several days of download.  For those interested, the full chain could be loaded in the background and the software switched to use the full chain once it is available (say, 10 days later...).

Anyone interested could as well re-build the pruned chain from the full chain and confirm its integrity/correctness etc.  What is the difference?
Besides, any stakeholder that is interested (ie BTC holder) could sign a pruned chain (or hash thereof... ) to confirm its integrity, so the ability to produce a new baseline pruned chain is not limited to core developers.
Has this been discussed before, as the tweetstorm seemed to indicate?

Exactly.  Buying (and I suppose, selling) assets gives the central bank the ability to influence, or manipulate, greatly markets.  Besides, it raises significant issues regarding conflict of interest: why buy this stock versus this one, why buy gold and not silver, why buy ETH and not BTC :) etc. etc.
In general, buying of assets will only benefit shareholders/owners of these assets.  
Why wouldn't the central bank print money and distribute it evenly to the population instead ?
In other words, why are central banks allowed to make discriminatory policies that only benefit a small part of the population ?

Maybe it is possible to setup a scheme like this:
- If funds of a specified address have moved during the past 6 months, only Alice is allowed to sign transactions
- If funds have not moved during the past 6 months, Alice OR Bob are allowed to sign transactions and can only move these funds to address RA (whose private key Alice has safely stored offline).  
- If funds in RA have not moved for 3 months, Alice or Bob are allowed to sign transactions and can move funds wherever.
It would be interesting to have the possibility to monitor the signing of a message (this would demonstrate knowledge of the private key) rather than moving funds, as this is much less impractical.

Indeed both the code size and the number of issues (I generated a chart of github issues last week to check) have grown significantly over the years.

Clearly so! 
Which is why I believe that there might be a lack of resources working on the project. 
Which, on its own, is quite peculiar as you would expect large BTC holders to contribute to the development of the project as an "insurance" for their investments...
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:53:33
Thank you for the explanations.
I gather from your answer that the development team is short of resources. Is this a fair assessment based on your answer? I know GitHub says that there are 460 developers, but maybe that is not enough, or maybe many of them are inactive? 
Why aren't there more calls for contributions? Or have I missed something?

Good summary.  Whereas OP mentions banks as proximate, it does not clearly identify the role of governments in this sad state of affairs.  Banks operate within legal boundaries set by governments and hence it is difficult to blame these corporations for maximizing profits if that is what they are entitled (or even obliged...) to do within the existing legal frameworks.

But I see that 460 contributors are listed on GitHub: wouldn't you think this is enough? Or is there a more fundamental organizational issue, such as overly limiting commit rights to a handful of people, or incorrect prioritization, or maybe a lack of modularization of the software? I try to understand what can possibly lead to this kafkaesque situation.

They are about 1800 billionaires on the planet, so between the 10th and 11th order, indicating that the new BTC "billionaires" should own at least 1600 BTCs. Each BTC should be worth at least 625000 USD.
At that rate, that would make 1875 USD per capita (ie 0.003 BTC).

1. The Trustee had to sell enough to demonstrate solvency.  This is now done and there is no need to sell anymore.
2. In the likely scenario that the majority of creditors opt for BTC payments only, it may be the case that the Trustee actually buys BTC back.  That would result in some 20000+ BTC being bought to cover initial claims of BTC claimants.  Probably this will not happen as the Trustee will avoid any further market operations given past criticism.
3. Upon distribution (end 2019 ?), it is likely that about 25000 BTC would be sold by creditors on open markets, over the course of a few weeks.
4. Because the fundamentals remain unchanged, and because BTCs move away from larger long-time holders to many new BTC holders, this is actually quite positive for BTC.  
5. The amounts at stake are limited.
Expected result: no impact on the market, or a bit positive.

If you mean decreasing total money supply or decreasing money supply over time, probably this has not been tried before.  Hence, no conclusion can be drawn as to whether that would lead to "success".
The closest you could get is a 100% gold-backed currency, because gold supply self-adjust with the gold price, and hence a 100% gold backed currency could be seen as constant money supply over time.
In this case, you will find that the longest lasting "economies" have actually been gold and/or silver backed, ie constant money supply over time based.
But that is still nowhere close from some societies which have latest thousands of years without government or money, which could be seen as the most "successful" by some definition.

The following is completely false:
With BLS, all signatures in one block could fit in 32 bytes, essentially zero overhead. 
Compare this to the current average of 1200 tx x 64 bytes = 77 kbytes per block, or about 10% overhead for signatures.

So yes, things are moving in the right direction on all front, but still need to be "materialized" through BIPs, implementation, testing and deployments.

Last time I checked for Belgium there were enough funds in the Belgian insurance scheme to cover 50.000 accounts in case of a bank failure.  You think it will work?
Besides, several EU countries are now imposing capital controls and restrict the amount of cash transactions (France, Italy etc.), to the tune of 1000 or 2000 EUR.
This serves two purposes: 1) Lock you in the bank so they can practice negative interest rates (or apply fees etc.) so that at the end of the year you owe the bank and 2) Protect against bank runs.
You think that system is sound? 
Because banks lend to each other, and because some of them are TBTF, the only way to save them in case of crisis is with .gov intervention.  Which means printing billions and trillions more, which in turns means creating a bigger, unmanageable, problem for the future.

Note sure.  I guess each node uses some form of gossip protocol to get a description of the network topology as a directed graph.  Which potentially means that one specific node cannot "see" the whole graph (if my assumption is correct that the graph is directed of course, although that will depend also on what the gossip protocol transfers as information).  
Also, as nodes come and go, I guess even a few minutes difference may result in different graphs.

Excellent post! 
The reasons to be doubtful stem indeed from the lost art of political economy.  At the same time, it is deeply concerning that we do not see more experiment related to startup societies. Maybe some would/could work, and provide a better basis for mankind future? 
Without carefully planning, executing and recording the results of such social experiments, it will always stay a matter of debate, and we are depriving ourselves from the possibility to find better alternatives. 
In short, we need a scientific / experimental approach to designing working societies, sustained by quantified goals and evidence-based.  I also find it particularly concerning that almost zero effort is spent by the scientific community to use modelling tools and AI to help with designing these societies.  That should be a primary objective!

They debased coinage over time, starting with bitcoinicus in the beginning and ending up with shitcoinicus just before collapse.
Of interest is how Romans started using gold and silver coins initially (aureus and argenteus), gradually mixing or replacing precious metals with common metals.  As a parallel, the coinage act of 1792 states that:
"the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars or units … of the value [mass or weight] of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure … silver."

Not necessarily more protection, but I believe (TBC) it adds two important features: Similar characters are removed and error detection is build in.
Further to this, I am not 100% sure that any encryption scheme works nicely on 256 bits input.  That needs to be ascertained.
Last, standardization is important, so that encrypted addresses can be read by whatever your wallet is.  This reduces the risk of "loosing" private keys (because you just don't remember how it was encrypted maybe...)

I disagree that an offline wallet on computer is safer than a paper wallet.
Disk failures, remote scanning etc. are also possible + it is just too easy to misconfigure that computer (oups... it is connected and should not be etc..).

The average wealth of the top 1% is roughly 770 KUSD.
Assuming one third of that is in real estate, we get 500 KUSD net financial worth.
Assuming further that 20% of that net worth is allocated to BTC, we get 100 KUSD allocated to BTC for the top 1%.
Which gives us a current target price of 50 KUSD per piece.

Payroll taxes, corporate taxes, estate and excise taxes would likely be the similar or even easier to enforce.  That is, about 52% of all taxes.
Income taxes would need to be looked at.  Presumably, only taxes whose collection can be automated may make it.  
The net result of all of this may well be a more efficient way of collecting taxes, quite possibly completely automated, alleviating the need for some 80.000 IRS employees.  
It could even be argued that if a tax cannot be automated, it should not exist in the first place, as otherwise it creates loopholes etc.

I haven't read much about the debates pre-dating the constitution, but it would be really interesting to see what were the options considered, and why.  For example, they could have defined a dollar as a certain amount of gold and/or silver, and leave it up to anyone to produce, while mandating the government to be paid in gold/silver coins.  That would have removed the control of the money supply from the government, while ensuring that business remained efficient.  As gold/silver coins were in wide circulation at that time, I am sure that such a system must have been considered.

Inflation simply put the burden of debt on future generations.  
That is why it is supported by "men in power", and in turn by most economists as their livelihood depends on those.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:11:04
Wrong - it does have to do with wealth distribution.
When new money is created, it lands on the table of big corporations first before it trickles down to the populace.  This allows these big corporations to purchase goods and services at a lower price than the populace.  That is, before inflation kicks in.   
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:11:19
Thank you Pieter for taking the time to explain your thinking in more details!
I think you are right wrt ECC slow vs fast breakage.  In my view, a fast breakage essentially means the end of the story IF we would have large amount of funds stored in addresses that have been re-used.  That is because these funds would likely be stolen immediately, creating a non-recoverable event (from a PR point of view), unless one would decide to continue working on a chain that pre-date the event (extremely unlikely).
Similar situation for the silent inflation case: a fast ECC breakage creates a non-recoverable event.
So we are left with only one issue to protect against: ie a slow ECC breakage.  Which, for both address reuse / message signing and the silent inflation issue can be addressed as the threat becomes more "pressing" (if ever)  Does that makes sense? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:28:14

Maybe it is time to re-consider this position then.
As you may know, the chemical structure of psilocybin is very close to LSD.
Here is a recent study of the effect of LSD on the brain:
I cite: "Results demonstrate that LSD alters self-experience as well as basic social cognition processing in areas of the ‘social brain'. Furthermore, these alterations are attributable to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation, thereby pinpointing towards this receptor system in the development of pharmacotherapies for sociocognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders."
One cannot discard the most simple explanation that humans became ... humans by eating what was widely available around them.

@_date: 2018-04-21 19:48:52
Thank you for explaining the issue so clearly!
One question though: my understanding is that when a Bitcoin user signs a message, this reveals the public key.  So an ECC break would allow all those corresponding private keys to be recuperated, and corresponding funds to be stolen.  This would essentially be the end of the story, regardless of the possibility to silently inflate.
So, if there is a concern about an ECC break, shouldn't the signing feature be removed, as well as any other operation which may reveal the public key?
If it is not removed, then I would argue that the risk of silent inflation is on an equal footing, and hence acceptable. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:07:25
Can it be helpful for sidechains at least and isn't Grin integrating them right now?
Also, shouldn't it be possible to prune the blockchain (Bitcoin Core already has this feature) and introduce CT / Bulletproofs "on" the pruned chain (as a fork, obviously) ?

Why has this change been effected? Was it part of the NYA in any way? If not, I would say it should be immediately reverted.

Yes, I know the debate has been going on forever, which is exactly my point: why is this suddenly becoming an unacceptable situation?

Assuming highly commoditized hardware (say, an Intel CPU) is the optimal form of PoW, we would end up in a situation where mining is centralized in the cheapest electricity region(s).  So, changing the PoW is maybe a temporary solution, but not THE solution to the mining centralization issue.

It is interesting to note that in a "free market", competition is supposed to lead to the best outcome.  So two things: granting a cartel the monopoly to print money appears to be at the opposite of this concept, and secondly, the fact that there are so many crypto currencies right now is presumably very good.

In my understanding, the Congress defined the silver dollar as the legal tender of the US.

I would say that they are several forms of centralization.  One of them is the centralization of the mining industry in one country, owing to the competitive advantage of ASICs manufacturing and/or electricity prices.  But there are other form of centralization in the BTC ecosystem that should be addressed.
