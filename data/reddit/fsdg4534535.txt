I think it would have been better if Ripple had been built on top of BTC instead of XRP -- of course then there would be no funding mechanism for opencoin.. still maybe someone can fork Ripple to make it use BTC? XRP certainly is a currency and already some people have made decent profits hoarding it and buying it up cheaply from people who received them for free.. it may already be in a bubble though.

a number of exchanges have recently been closed - this has certainly cut off a lot of poeple who were previously buying BTC and is probably the main factor behind the decrease in price.
 bitfloor.com - US, closed
 bitcoin-central.net - France, suspended
 bitcoin-24.com - UK/Germany, closed (might reopen)
in addition transferwise.com has blocked sending funds to the account numbers belonging to all the bitcoin exchanges they know about. This was one of the main ways people in the UK were buying BTC. There are other ways, but not as cheap or easy.
btc-e.com has also suspended liqpay transactions.

Hmm yeah.. the whole clolored coins thing seems like a bad idea to me.. it wastes space in the blockchain and serves no real purpose when there is already external counterparty risk.
I guess what I would like to see is a system where non-BTC currencies are traded using the Ripple concensus system and trust model but better integrated with Bitcoin for paying fees and jumping the gap between people who have no trust relationship.
