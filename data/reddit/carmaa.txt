There's a plenty of technologies that has failed, and that you could plot as a flat line on the bottom of that chart. There's no reason why Bitcoin couldn't end up as a failure (adoption-wise) as well.
To compare bitcoin with these technologies and implying that the bitcoin price equals the adoption rate is not only comparing apples and oranges - it is straight out misleading.

This is stupid. Facebook was created by a hacker. We trust that app with our whole life.
There are other far more important issues related to Bitcoin to throw brain cycles at than trying to change the media's use of the word "hacker".
Hint: Changing the media coverage is not going to work, because media freakin' love it.

Well, the problem is that the probability distribution fails to predict high-impact outliers - for example the odd occurrence that you are hacked. It works very well for everything else, and the probability that you'll get hacked *today* is probably very low, but that is of little consolation when all your BTC is gone. 
Banks are there for a reason - one of many reasons they are here is that most people don't trust their own physical security (house, etc.) to protect large amounts of money (the black swan event here being for instance burglary or a fire), while banks can spread the risk over many people and focus on protecting their assets.

I said that Bitcoin isn't tied to a specific political system, not that political systems don't change the way money works.
I have no knowledge of the USSR banking system, but "greed, book cooking and corruption" doesn't sound like effective "absolute regulation" to me.
I agree that excessive regulation is bad for business, but I believe that some regulation is necessary for a stable economic system. Does that make me a socialist?
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:15:02
I don't think Bitcoins are libertarian or socialist, just the same way I don't think the concept of money or value holds a particular political flavor.
Bitcoin is a vehicle of trade, and I believe that it will revolutionize the way we transfer value. It may have its origins in libertarian ideas, but if it becomes mainstream you can bet your BTC that it won't be fully unregulated.
I also think it is blissfully naive to believe a banker that essentially says: "Regulation is bad for business, give me your money, I promise I'm not like the other bankers". Good luck with that.

I love The Economist - as usual its articles are sobering, factual and without too much speculation.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:30:49
Aren't we forgetting that [there was a time when banks were unregulated]( and that it backfired because, you know, people in essence are greedy?
You are right that bankers love unregulated markets though, but I suspect this has more to do with that it is easier to reap a quick profit.

I've got a master's degree in information security and cryptography - both on which Bitcoin is founded on. And coincidentally, cryptography is all about math.
So here's the thing: Your math checks out (I see that you can use a calculator), but your core assumption doesn't have the same scientific punch:
* You don't know that Bitcoin will reach mass adoption, but you're assuming it will
* Even if Bitcoin will reach mass adoption, you don't know that it will be in one year, but you're assuming it will
That's the make and break assumptions that your calculations are based on. Nobody knows if they will check out or not, which makes your calculations moot, or a gamble at best.
While I sincerely hope that Bitcoin will rise to the adoption levels you are writing about, I personally don't think your assumptions are correct, and I think they are counter-productive in the sense that they are fueling an ongoing investment frenzy that are far outrunning current levels of adoption.
You're also assuming that I'm a dimwit - but I guess that speaks more to your personality than your mathematics skills.

Haha. Next couple of years? Are you serious? And since when is $100K-5.5m the expected exchange rate? Did I miss the memo?
"Run the numbers" makes no sense when you're operating with numbers that are, frankly, a mix of bullshit, "mathematics" and wishful thinking.

It dampens *the effect* of greediness, not necessarily the greediness itself.
Not saying that regulation necessarily is the answer, just that we would actually be worse off with no regulation at all.

Hear, hear. Get to [that thread]( and spread information about bitcoin in a clear and non-fanboy fashion.
The community has a real chance here to advocate the use of bitcoin to a vast base of people that have limited economical knowledge, not to mention technical skills. You know, people. These are the folks we need to win over to make bitcoin succeed.
Go now, and go fast!

We're going to see a lot of this. One of the things Bitcoin enables is pickpocketing someone from 12450 miles (~20000 km) away.
Encrypting your wallet won't prevent this if someone is able to hack your box.

What is your opinion on the fact that the BTC-E chatbox is used to spread malware that steals bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:38:56
If someone is able to install malware on the machine where from which you access your encrypted wallet, that someone can log your password, and/or find the encryption key in memory.

This may be true in the longer term, but during a hype-cycle such as this it is simply not true. There is just no way the adoption rate of a new currency is doubling each week.
Speculation is the word.

I don't dispute the math, and I never claimed to be smart, merely to have a degree. However, I think you confuse adoption with the BTC price, and that you haven't factored in other possible future scenarios such as a pure underground or fringe Bitcoin economy.
I'll see you back in this thread in a year. If the value of 1 BTC is above 100,000 USD, I'll send you 1,000 USD (in BTC or USD, you decide). 
If the value is below 100,000 USD, you'll have to buy me a beer - and a good one, that is. If you do the math on this and factor in your assumptions, you'll find that it is good bet.

Can we please not make this thread about sites that *only* accept bitcoins, or sites that sells bitcoin related stuff? No offense, but it's way more interesting to hear about businesses that are selling regular stuff and are trying out bitcoin.
