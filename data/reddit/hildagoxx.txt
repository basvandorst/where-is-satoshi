Because it is a trading platform with no info on who runs it, no postal address, no names, no nothing.

Sell your Bitcoin for USD cash.
Then buy Bitcoin again for USD cash.
Wear a mask while doing the selling/buying in a dark alley.
Now your Bitcoin will be anonymous as fu.ck.

On the website you liked (portugalio.com) it says you are registered in Lisboa, Portugal.
On the website ( it says: 
"Any claim relating to useCryptos's web site shall be governed by the **laws of Brazil** without regard to its conflict of law provisions." 
**What is it? Portugal or Brazil???**
Sounds freaking shady to me

WTF is wrong witch you people?
Point of Bitcoin is that it is unregulated.
Now calling for help from some "governing body", LOL.
Take your own responsibility.
