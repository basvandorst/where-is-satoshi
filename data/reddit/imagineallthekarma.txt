I bought one for 5 bucks off someone on here a while back just to say I had one
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:32:44
I currently use blockchain.info for my hot wallet, anyone have a recommendation to switch to?
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:42:58
The only issue would be are there enough people in greece selling bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:34:02
Or he's been under investigation for tax fraud for a while now and after the cops saw the story they decided to raid now before he flees or whatever 
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:15:33
Serious question are there insurance companies out there that will insure bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:10:28
How is the japanese investigation going? any chance this fucker will face jail time?
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:12:20
Does this mean that coinbase wallets do not each have an individual private key?
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:52:54
Would some sort of transaction mixing work
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:47:03
weren't there rumors he died in the japan tsunami
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:41:59
What is airBnB?
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:29:27
Regulation and more government is not what bitcoin needs right now. As the currency matures exchanges will be insured by insurance companies to keep customers money safe. The insurance companies will probably mandate the exchanges implement some sort of oversight 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:21:59
They distrust the bitcoin chain?
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:47:51
Ah got it I'll set it up to forward when i get home
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:52:50
Cant you buy/sell bitcoins on circle? They could just be making the spread

Overall from the first time you put money in BTC how are you doing financially 
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:18:47
What exactly is stored in the wallet.dat file? is it not just the private key?
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:12:47
OR could it be exchanges have some money stuck in gox?
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:16:14
I took 50 bucks from Coinbase to Blockchain and It took a few seconds for ir to be received and i thought i mistyped the public key
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:09:08
My question extends off of this one. If Satoshi created bitcoin and has not come forward who exactly is managing it. Who are these "core devs" and how do they decide what gets implemented or not, like the cutting if transaction fees
@_date: 2014-08-24 20:14:39
Maybe the public key of the reserve is on the note? So when the note is redeemed its shredded and the coins are paid out. Only issue is you'd need an address for every single bill
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:15:14
I would assume you'd mix it up into many transitions and not put all of it on one bet
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:08:18
Mine did eventually go through and now Im keeping it in a paper wallet for a while
@_date: 2014-07-25 01:00:38
My dad lost a small bet ($10 or less) with his brother and wrote him a check with for drugs on the memo line. He was given a funny look by the teller but nothing came of it
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:33:20
Can I also take you up on that offer?
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:33:51
Im running a full node but i don't port forward my router. Is that necessary 
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:18:28
Also with yahoo's bitcoin support you can just add it in the native stocks app on iPhone because apple uses yahoos backend
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:46:51
The large amount will have more security that will take longer to crack
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:14:24
Yes but for traders (users of bloomberg) its not ideal
@_date: 2014-08-07 06:39:05
Yes, I hate having to email a photo of my private key QR from my phone to my computer in order to import into block chain (this was when apple pulled the block chain app)
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:32:41
Can I send payment in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:45:56
Heres my theory. Gox has been lying about its price, and what ever algorithm they use to manipulate it is still running
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:50:00
or just doing returns in store credit
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:24:22
Hey, you called it.
@_date: 2014-08-01 08:57:48
How does the bot respond so quickly?
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:54:26
Why isn't the change address the public key from the address i sent from?
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:04:35
Anything other than gox is good at this point
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:44:35
Actually if gox really didn't have these coins they may have been running a ponzi like scheme to try and get them back
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:46:54
how much weed was sold on the silk road?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:51:31
Got it thanks

Is kraken american? I thought it was European 
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:14:19

@_date: 2014-03-10 15:29:01
There is a mac app by the same name. I opened it am i safe?
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:10:43
I used coinbase and it took almost 12 hours to send .3 btc to a paper wallet
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:52:03
these came as text messages not emails
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:15:08
I just type randomly for several minutes in the seed box, be sure to include characters not commonly used (©˙¬∆˚©¬ç˚†∂¥ˆ§®) etc
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:21:54
can i get a source on the number of BTC in existence in june 2011?
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:34:30
Ally does the same but they cover an unlimited amount of fees
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:32:35
What has it come to where we use Suicide Hotline postings and Memes per day as buy indicators 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:43:19
Ok, thanks for the info
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:48:56
I really hope that in 10-15 years we have a movie about this. Maybe Wolf of Wall Street style
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:04:02
I don't remember where i heard about it. It might have been on reddit, but i started mining around november 2012 on an old GPU. I mined about 2 coins after a week and a half but i sold off and stopped mining after that because i thought it wasn't worth using my GPU for. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:09:47
I know dogecoin did a hard fork to eliminate multi pools but I'm not sure exactly how they did so
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:43:22

Did you buy it directly from tesla? Will tesla take bitcoin if you ask them
@_date: 2014-07-15 17:25:16
Shit thought it was a pm...
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:51:05
Got it thanks. Blockchain does not have my private keys right? So I'm safe waiting this out. I only have .15 btc in block chain and my rest are in cold storage
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:40:51
Is it in the bitcoin chain or the name coin chain?
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:31:59
Im not buying or selling much. Under 1k per month
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:47:59
We have to wait for mark to get out of prison. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:05:23
Would bitcoins be covered under homeowners insurance?
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:01:22
Is there an investigation going on? any chance of an indictment 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:01:20
select the US stream 
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:48:25
or maybe there is one big "slush fund" that holds many BTC and every time a cash deposit is made a new address is generated and the amount is put onto the new public key, assuming the ATM has internet connectivity 
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:11:09
Ok Sent payment 
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:41:53
Isn't litecoin also asic resistant?
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:45:20
Thats how I use them. Just print out my private key and mail it to someone who i owe money to /s
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:50:06
You might also want to print the encrypted wallets and put them somewhere safe. (safety deposit box, home safe, etc)
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:32:49
Id buy one for the novelty, where is it listed?
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:48:19
so does onename.io embed your name into the block chain in a way that rush wallet can pick up on it?
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:23:28
Me too, well I had about $10 worth but I considered that a loss well before they shut down. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:40:30

Piracy is illegal bitcoin is not

I wouldn't combine arbitrage and coin mixing
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:51:17
I store no coins on my computer but ill remove the application and run a virus scan, was there anything in there that looked like it could be used to compromise web wallets via a key logger or anything?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:28:56
The suicide hotline does tend to be posted at the low point and memes appear during a run up. Maybe these things can be used as indicators...
@_date: 2014-09-01 21:01:14
While they should have used strong passwords an exploit was found within the find my iPhone feature that didnt lock you out after a certain number of attempts, opening up the door to a brute force
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:27:48
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:54:25
Yeah thats my point, if square charges 2.75 theres no way tiger direct pays 3
@_date: 2014-07-04 07:46:50
Is there any downside to running a node on my home PC? I use it mainly as a server (media server, mine craft server, etc)
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:40:42
karpeles or satoshi?
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:20:48
My square reader only charges 2.75% of CC sales I'm sure a company with hundreds of millions in revenue mostly CC gets a far lower rate
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:06:35
14 btc is still almost 10 grand. I have no idea how wealthy op is but 10 grand can be a lot of money for some people

I hate to interrupt the anti chase jerk we have going but I use chases "Online bill pay" feature where you can send personal checks via snail mail without leaving the couch

How do you know if the input is going to have a fee?
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:35:05
USD stored in coinbase are FDIC insured?
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:53:19
I feel like every time this the bubble cycle or the suicide hotline is posted we are either at a top or bottom 
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:37:17
Take a look at [this]( op
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:28:22
Apple has been standing up to the US government on encryption lately. I hope that do the same over in the UK
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:32:39
as long as its bip38 encrypted he's fine, and safe deposit boxes can easily be drilled by the bank
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:33:31
And if bitcoin were to ever fail you can spend the silver
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:52:04
Where do you recommend I store my fiat?

Just wondering how does this out perform greenaddress.it
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:59:17
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:06:30
Got it. I'm in no hurry to get the money moved so as long as it happens eventually that's fine 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:41:10
whens the fork?
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:42:51
Or even in a conference room that isn't all fancy like a court 
@_date: 2018-11-17 07:33:12


Do you have a source on that?
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:34:55
I got real close to trying to trade this news.....
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:04:15
I thought the pool can see your IP when you're mining, and if they can see it so can the NSA
EDIT: Never mind just use a VPN
@_date: 2015-09-11 16:08:33
He'd just get extradited 
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:39:50
Are the addresses containing the coins known?

While he probably wasn't complicit in the theft, he clearly knew about it and tried to cover up that it happened
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:58:25


They grabbed him in an internet cafe iirc

I use bitcoin to pay for my VPN, and I use more opsec than a friend who is a regular on various darknet sites

my debit card has super easy charge back

But it won't appear in the blockchain and therefore won't be valid 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:07:52
it will happen but due to inflation you will only be able to buy a candy bar with that money
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:41:53
So then the bitcoin community will have to trust the notes issued by one of these banks in order for it to work. I've seen what fractional reserve is doing to the fiat system I really don't want it in btc. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:24:38
Yes but the govt allows it. The blockchain will catch any fake coins

Are the billions of private keys created before the right one found able to be reused?
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:02:05
can someone please explain how controlling more that 50% of mining can put the blockchain at risk
