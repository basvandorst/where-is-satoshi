The equifax fiasco is bad but at least there are ways to fix the damage it has done.  There is no way to fix a whole exchange being hacked because no one would be held responsible.  You are comparing the worst case scenario of our system now with the best case scenario that bitcoin promises.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:05:48
And that would suck but that rarely happens.  Bitcoin is not subject to the same amount of security that a bank account is.  It is more likely your bitcoin will be hacked out of your account than for your bank account to be drained due to civil forfeiture.

I just took Econ 101 at University and was top 10%! :D
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:12:46
What are the risks, in your opinion, of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:33:10
That is true.  That would solve one of my main issues with it too.  Would the lightning transactions decrease the power cost right now?  Because the network uses a lot of electricity right now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:23:15
I think you are overexposed to bitcoin and clearly don’t get how t relates to the average person.  You seem overly optimistic about it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:12:02
But major exchanges go offline or become backed up constantly. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:12:26
Ok, then bitcoin is an investment tool or a store of wealth.  What makes it worth anything then?  Why would I have a reason to put my money in bitcoin if there is no real use for it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:14:46
I know the "altcoin" you are talking about and realize the potential it has.  There is no reason though, that bitcoin should be higher than it right now.  And that's what I'm here to find out.  Why are people putting so much money into it right now if it has no good use? It seems like wild speculation.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:07:19
That is a true scenario but I'm talking more about the day-to-day use.  Most people do not have to worry about the situations you described arising.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:11:05
What is their roadmap then?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:22:54
Yeah I know what you mean.  Gold has some uses in electronics though but diamonds are overpriced.  They look cool though.  I think gold has just been so integral to economies for so long, that it just has staying power.  Maybe bitcoin or the other "altcoin" will reach that point.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:17:25
Yeah, it's kinda a bummer now.  Savings accounts used to be such a great way to start off learning about investing and wise money habits but they aren't as good now.  There are other opportunities that have sprung up though.  Like broad ETFs that track large indexes.  They have very good and predictable rates of returns that outpace inflation.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:45:38
But why would that person accept the bitcoin in lieu of a transaction through PayPal or VISA.  If they can accept bitcoin, then they have the ability to accept PayPal.  But PayPal has much faster payment times and much greater reliability.  They are also much less prone to fraud and scams.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:10:47
Savings accounts are not a good store of value.  They don't keep pace with inflation and generally used for short-term, liquid cash.  The name, savings account, does not mean it is a good place to invest your money into or that it is a good store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:42
A lot of transactions now are people buying based on speculation.  That’s what makes it a bubble.  If not then give me proof.  But I’m going to ignore you if you continue to spout nonsense supported by nothing concrete.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:57:42
That is true but I don't think there is a huge problem with people buying something, getting the product, then somehow the payment reversing and making the seller worse off
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:59:41
Except the US dollar is backed by the country with the highest GDP of the world.  And people have no reason to invest in or use the US dollar as a store of currency.  It is just used as a method of transaction and even then it is still losing value.  Bitcoin has no underlying use right now so why should people use it as a store of value or as a tool to invest.

That's assuming people in Africa will accept bitcoin. There are other ways to get here money.  If no banks are nearby, then what makes you think she has a chance of using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:20:45
That's a good example.  I just don't really see bitcoin being adopted widely enough to not need exchanges for normal use.  And that's not to say exchanges will always be bad like they are now.  On coinbase they had no reason to expect the sudden increase in demand and they weren't prepared for it.

A startup that offers no better solutions
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:01:14
No, you just have to worry about the massive daily fluctuations of it.  If anything you have to be way more worried about bitcoins smaller economy rather than if you had invested in the US economy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:24:57
That's pretty cool, but it is on the small scale.  And I feel like most people would trade the potential upside of bitcoin, for the security of the US dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:24:29
Use of Bitcoin is up around 25% but the price is up over 10x that.  How is that not indicative of a bubble.  You are blinded by your investment in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:07:13
But why would anyone use it then.  Right now I have a multi-billion dollar corporation backing and verifying my purchases and it's in their best interest to make sure everything goes well.  Not to mention my accounts are backed by the FDIC so if anything crazy happens I will be protected. 
The only time I can see it not being backed by a government or a big bank being helpful is that if the country and our currency collapses.  If that happens to the US, I will have much bigger problems to worry about than the value of the dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:15:23
But what right now facilitates transactions like that?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:01:28
That is completely irrelevant to the question.  I asked why it works for day to day use.  Of course rich people wouldn't likely be affected that much by that but normal people wouldn't waste money like that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:27:24
Seems more like a gimmick to me, especially right now.  It's harder to use and transaction fees are high right now- higher than the cup of coffee.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:24:33
But there's no real reason to use it other than that other people want it.  That means it's a bubble and bound to collapse
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:12:44
What reasoning do you have to back up the assumption that we will be payed in bitcoin.  That's what I'm trying to get at in this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:58:48
Ok :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:04:44
Ok.  Your whole life is tied to Bitcoin.  You have everything to lose being wrong.  You have done nothing to make your case any more appealing.  You have attacked me personally for having a dissenting opinion.  You are too emotionally and financially tied to bitcoin to hold a rational conversation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:04:02
But the vast majority of people don't need something like bitcoin.  If they do, then give an example.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:17:58
Ok so then Bitcoin is not fiat because a government didn’t decree it.  It is still worth way more than it should be right now.  It’s in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:08:08
Like what.  And how is my debit card transaction not irreversible.
And if I was to get scammed, I would have no way of recovering my money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:00:31
But a store of value needs to be stable.  Bitcoin is not a good store of value if one day its worth $1000 and the next it’s worth $1500 then $750 the next day.  You have no clue how much a Bitcoin will be worth in 5 years but the US dollar will be worth something similar to what it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:06:23
That is a good point about the limited supply.  I think that's really the only benefit of it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:52:11
Inflation is necessary and healthy.  And Bitcoin is fiat too.  There is nothing of value to back it up
