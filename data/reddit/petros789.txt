The power of r/bitcoin at work, hidden away to the front page in just over a day. That's fantastic!

This seems awesome! I'm running it myself and spitting the output to  if anyone wants to see it in action. Thanks OP!

This sort of sounds like an attempt to make The Oasis from Ready Player One. But I wouldn't take this project remotely seriously unless it had at least a 30 person team with a half million dollar budget. This guy has no idea what he's getting himself into.

Now this is pretty awesome!

This would be an amazing concept to see Bitcoin recognized as a currency of an entire country! I feel like this project could succeed with the proper funding and publicity as well as having the people of the island know how this all works!
I'd definitely be into buying products from them through bit coin if we could set up an easy way to be able to do that. This would probably be the most important part so that their economy can continue to run on a bitcoin standard.
Just my 2 cents. Also to the OP if you need help on web dev side of this project I'd love to help!

Personally I don't push it to people unless I know they could potentially get into it or like it. Such as a friend I work with just bought all the parts for his gaming rig and has a nice 7850 with it. So I pushed him toward bitcoins.

I gotcha, that'd still be a really good to have for them in their current situation!

My idea to handle it was to have two sections, stores on a map and online stores. I would make it so that anyone could add to both sections and also anyone can add reviews of the individual places so that you can know it they're reputable or not.

I think one of the biggest problems is the person in congress who eventually tries to regulate bitcoin won't actually understand how it works before they try and then utterly fail when they do try.

Very awesome idea! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:54:27
That was basically the idea I was going to go for in terms of real shops!

I really like this idea actually! One problem I do have is trying to figure out where I can spend my bitcoins. Thanks!
