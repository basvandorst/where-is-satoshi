I transferred from GDAX to Trezor earlier today, and it took a few hours to complete.

What is a good wallet that supports segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:52:05
This right here. I travel alot and I have much less worry about my 'home' since any issues are not mine to resolve. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:36:47
Sorry that is what I meant.   So if I bought BTC with USD I need to report that even if I am just holding?    
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:55
To limit your exposure, I wondee if it's a good idea to bukt a virtual machine from trusted ISO and do your transaction in the VM . Hyperv is built into windows 10.

Haha,  I am far from a millennial....and I was joking :)

@_date: 2017-12-13 22:27:03
Do you only report gains and losses at time of sale of previously held coins?
If you are just buying coin and holding there is nothing to do right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:23:55
I mean someone has to spend it right?  Otherwise it's just people hording it without any real use of it.

After owning several homes....this is why I rent. :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:53:00
Ha, good point.  I guess what I am asking is, should I just leave it in CEX.IO and check back later over time.  Should I transfer it to another service?  I'm thinking of investing USD to buy other BTC so I am looking for recommendations on what service to transfer it to to I suppose.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:50:21
Oh weird. Every rental I have had included everything.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:32:38
Some Bank transfers take days, some are instant depending on bank. Credit cards are instant
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:33:46
Homes are Money pits, that tie you down to a spot.   Rent,  move around,  be freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
Or just live with your parents and save tons of money and invest it into Bitcoin.

What Altcoins were you considering mining?
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:03:31
So if you are buying and holding, what's the issue?
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:32:18
The fallacy of the secure mac.  Apple really did a number on users convincing them to trust apple, even though exploits exist for Java, flash,etc.

This site is hosted on the same server according to scamadviser.comAlso under the picture of the debit card with MasterCard logo it says:"Yes.  It works at most ATM machines worldwide. It is a visa-branded debit card."

If you are using 2Fa on your hotmail/Outlook.com, you can go and look at the historic login locations in your account settings now

If you order at todays price,  does it lock in the price, and you just wait to get it?   
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:27:55
So over time it gets harder and harder to get new coins in the world?  So is that intended to drive up the value of those that exist?
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:27:50
Might I ask....why is this wrong?  What would be the better way?
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:22:56
Sweet, and thank you!  I will setup the tip wallet when I get off of mobile!   awesome idea!
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:45:29
+1 for WindowsPhone
Had the HTC 8X, and I'm glad I upgraded to the Nokia 928
Have you tried the BitCoin Wallet integration yet?  It works quite well.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:49:35
Also in BC mining....am I wrong in feeling like its like playing the lottery?  I can churn through 10miillion hashes and get nothing, or I can churn through 100 hashes and unlock a block and get 25 bct?   so the deck is stacked in favor of whoever can churn more hashes.    reminds me of the Willy wonka scene where veruca salts father hired all the workers to search for the golden ticket
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:57:41
There seem to be so many alt coins though.  Which ones are worthwhile to mine?  Is there a site to compare them?
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:22:20
I looked at cloudhashing.com and considered their silver $999 contract to give it a year to see how that faired out.  From the sound...it might be better to invest that in buying direct
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:19:36
Exactly.  Just a small amount of exploratory funds.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:17:21
I find the whole "mining" thing fascinating.   I wanted to grab just a cheap USB device to play around with, not with the hopes of making a profit.  It's the geek side of me who wants to probe how it all works.  I would like to mine alt coins since that seems the most likely avenue to "get" anything.     If I make some money along the  way, that's great, but I think it's more about interest and knowledge.  Who knows, maybe I'll catch bitcoin fever and that could change.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:20:01
Great advice!   I have not looked into the exchange process on coinbase yet, but I assume there are transaction fees?  Is it best to save up USD, and make a purchase, it to make smaller purchases like a % of paycheck per pay period.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:13:20
Pretty sweet.   do have to pre setup something as a tipper?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:39:47
Great!  I am 2FA using oauth tokens and yubikey at multiple levels.  Even though I have 0 coins, I set it up just in case.Am I wrong to be paranoid about outing my public BC address in faucets?  Any real danger in that?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:51:40
I was thinking of having one public address, and then just sending money from that address to a private address.  Does this show up if you look up the transaction history of the public address?  I have no need to hide...but I thought not having the main BC address known would be safer.   
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:20:19
Thanks, I'll check it out!
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:35:21
I see people say you can still mine for alt coins.  Altcoins seem like a dead end where someone is trying for luck.  I don't see them having the traction as bitcoin.   but....does mining for alt coins to buy bitcoins make any sense?
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:14:15
Thanks, I'll check it out when not on mobile!
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:30:00
It seems the $50-$70 for the eruptors isn't too bad compared to the current output of my GPU.  Just have laptops, so it would cost more than the gpu itself just to try it out
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:26:45
This is a great explanation!   it hits home the absurd thought I could gain anything by mining.  What becomes the incentive for people to continue to mine though?  If the payout is pretty static in the amount of coins, but it becomes less likely to get them
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:33:10
Thanks!  Maybe its time to diversify!
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:33:49
I see people say it takes awhile to setup a coinbase account, and there is a'newbie' window where I can't use them?  So basically I setup the minimum by using a checking account now, so when I may want to use them I am out of the newbie window?   
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:39:37
Understood.  I figured I'd buy a few USD worth to try transfers and wallets,etc.  To learn how they work before investing more.   I suppose my question is....is the only real way to get btc is to buy them, or things like faucets/pool mining/cloud hashing real options for someone starting out?
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:59:41
What speed is it hashing at?  Is it over clocked?
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:02:41
Hmmm...I've see this Bitcoin tip here on reddit.  How does it work exactly?  
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:27:08
If you are running windows 8, could you not just create a Virtual Machine in HyperV when you have the host computer offline?  Then save the VM on an external USB drive and only use it on a host machine that is disconnected from the internet?
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:15:53
Can you mine altcoins with CPU?  Or gpu only?
