Relative market cap percentage. It’s down to around 30% now, from ~80% early last year. It’s not about the raw number, it’s the market cap relative to other coins that determines dominance 
Also bitcoin will never be accepted as a medium of exchange with a fee of $25 that is growing every day. That is, until it solves its scaling fee. 
It’s a Chicken and egg problem. Nobody will use bitcoin as a medium of exchange until it fixes its scaling problem. But there is little incentive to fix the scaling problem if it primarily exists to be held. So essentially bitcoin is stuck being a commodity like gold.

Your argument is that scalable assets would take over if they were inherently better. And yet every day bitcoin’s market cap shrinks and is absorbed by scalable coins. It’s been shrinking at a constant rate for months. The takeover is already happening

*only works in a very specific environment that takes a software engineer to setup properly. Not deployed to scale. Roadmap still ambiguous*

Your argument is simply that more people are involved in bitcoin. That had nothing to do with the platform. It’s not fair to shit on another platform because less people use it

The ethereum blockchain has the same level of security as bitcoins blockchain, the same level of distribution, and the same level of independence. It’s literally the same base infrastructure with more features added.

Like what? I’ve never heard an actual example given 
Edit: also you realize ethereum is a billion dollar network at this point? The fact that it hasn’t been breached so far is in itself a proof of concept against theoretical holes
