Not yet (I'm from Bulgaria), but my bank account is in euros. There should still be almost no fee for transfers, even according to them, look at my post above. That is unless they interpret "European community" not as the EEA, but as the original 12 states, in which case -fuck you bank.

Thanks for the insightful answer!
I was more concerned about their security, given the amount of breaches they've had

Last I checked - they don't. They're operating in Slovenia but they convert all EUR transfers to USD

Well I was charged 23e tax on my first transfer to bitstamp (which was small). Are you referring to the SEPA deposit bitstamp creates for you? If all future transfers are tax free, that's cool but I'm not inclined to pay those taxes every time

I'm not sure warranty applies to overclocked GPUs, you can kill it pretty quickly with that, much quicker than 2 years

That is indeed the information I used, however my bank doesn't have a "normal EU transfer" form, the closest thing to that is "In foreign currency" which is the one I used.

Ok, forgive my ignorance if I missed something in the other posts but why does nobody seem to consider that hardware does not last infinitely? Specially overclocked GPUs? I've heard of overclocked cards dying after 2 years of mining. How does $400 initial cost + electricity costs factor in your calculations?

huge drop, what caused it?

This is what my bank says it taxes for these transfers. If I am correct, Slovenia is in the EEA (which is what I'm assuming they are referring to), so perhaps it is the bank's fault here...
