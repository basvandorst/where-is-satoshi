I've lurked around the issues and the dev mailing list and have submitted a small trivial fix/push to Bitcoin Core. I must admit, it has been rather intimidating at times.
I've wanted to ask questions (and add comments) to issues, but sometimes just backed out in fear someone will rip it apart. 
The problem is, because it can sometimes get political, some people assume those questions/comments are always loaded, when in fact it's just a genuine inquiry.
For the most part, the community is great &amp; helpful. There's just a few bad apples, which is luckily less than the nice ones. Let's just hope over time, it doesn't deter people from getting involved, otherwise it could deteriorate.

@_date: 2014-02-10 10:52:47
It depends on how the exchange does record-keeping. Doing record keeping on ONLY tx-id (like Mt. Gox) can give problems due it being malleable. Inputs, Outputs, Signatures all stay the same. Money is not being lost. Exchanges just have to do some extra processing (ie checking the blocking for the same inputs, outputs and signatures), rather than just relying on the tx id. It's a bug. But it's not a big bug.
Once you are 1, 2, maybe even 3 confirmations in, you can store the tx id. It's not that a big deal. It's just how record keeping is done.

The domain of a .bit site is stored in the decentralized registry blockchain, that is Namecoin. (There are other decentralized registry stores). A normal domain points a human-readable name to an IP address. But the process of making sure that only the right people can do that, it's centralized (see ICANN). We now have decentralized key-value stores. So registering a .bit domain means registering a name in the "d/" namespace on Namecoin. Say: "d/mysiteisfuckingawesome". Now, if you have a proper browser extension, or using something like DNSChain ( your browser knows where to go look if it wants to find who is the owner of "mysiteisfuckingawesome.bit". It goes look in a decentralized key-value store and finds the IP.

It's programmable. What if every bank had a very easy-to-use API for pushing/receiving value? And that's using a slightly wrong metaphor. Smart contracts allows for more complex value exchange that wasn't possible before (vs the usually person to person transfer of value idea).

It's really not a good comparison. While Esperanto's ideology is great, it didn't work well because 1) our languages are pretty fine as is, and 2) esperanto isn't a vast improvement over other languages.
For esperanto to have worked, we should've had a lot of trouble with our current languages &amp; Esperanto had to introduce very, very easy learning and new improved methods of communication. It's like Facebook beating MySpace. It only happened because 1) MySpace didn't innovate and 2) Facebook had a superior product. You only beat strong network effects if one sucks and the other is far superior. Incremental improvements don't unseat network effects.
Esperanto would be the equivalent of people around the world coming together to kickstart a new world-wide central bank.

@_date: 2014-02-10 10:55:06
This is correct. It's not that difficult to keep track of the transaction though. Inputs, outputs and signatures all stay the same. And that's still trackable if you watch the blockchain. Only store tx ids 1 - 2 confirmations in. Or don't even bother with tx ids until the malleability issue is fixed.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:46:43
Could be. I assumed him implying that currencies are mutually exclusive. Currencies, especially with cryptocurrencies overlap differently. ie, a Bitcoin user is not necessarily a user of Dogecoin, and vice versa. Or there could be in the intersection (user of both Doge and BTC). Some networks could be entirely contained in others. ie ALL Litecoin users (for arguments sake), ARE Bitcoin users.
So the one with the largest network effect of acceptance could possibly not contain the networks of other currencies.

Stuart Kaufmann talks about the "adjacent possible" quoted by Steven Johnson:  
  
“The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.  The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations.”
This is the blockchain. It kicks open so many new doors. Any and all ideas thrown towards the idea of a blockchain opens up so many new thought experiments. Truly exciting times to be alive.

Don't you think there's value in having separate social relational data for different platforms? In other words, my Twitter graph isn't the same as my Facebook graph.

I had a look at the the onename data on the namecoin blockchain, and it doesn't seem like you are currently storing graph information on it. For now, it looks like you are storing it within Onename? Do you intend to eventually push it to the blockchain (perhaps in v0.3)?

It's a novel idea, but there's a slight dis-incentive that comes with adding additional utility to the proof-of-work function. It reduces security slightly due to new misaligned incentives.

I still don't quite get it. Who has the reserves? The central bank? Or the commercial banks?
So, with a lower interest rate, isn't that supposed to mean that people will want to borrow (and thus create economic growth)? But for the banks, it's too low and risky?
I read up on it a while back, and still didn't get it. As far as I understand it. The fed is creating money to buy assets from banks to give them liquidity? So, what QE is essentially creating, is that the Fed ends up being &amp; owning a larger and larger amount of long-term assets?
So, the reason why there's been no inflation in price levels, is because the commercial banks haven't been lending this money out? Is it then safe to say, when interests rise again, banks can leverage more, and thus then see price inflation?

A wallet is like e-mail. Instead of sending text, you send Bitcoin. You have an address that's a string of number + letters. To get someone to pay you, you give them that address. Then if they have a wallet with some Bitcoin, they simply put in your address, set the amount of Bitcoin to send, and it sends it along instantly.

It does seem like side-chaining can't do decentralized issuance? In other words: there's no restricted 'units' in the sidechain, as the only way the nominal units get created is through pegging it. So if the side-chain is used to represent a limited supply of a new idea (a marketing/branding innovation), then a side-chain won't work. Side-chains are only effective for "technical" improvements?
Am I getting it right?

They don't charge fees. Coinbase takes a small cut on spread when buying through them. But sending/receiving = zero fees. It does become Paypal/Bank-esque.

I suspect the reason why he said that, was that at that stage, the upside of Bitcoin itself was higher, than investing in a company (I suspect it was $1 Billion then?). Until it reached a $10 billion cap is it is now, the reward becomes greater to start investing in companies instead. So, he might now have funded a Bitcoin exchange now that the marketcap has grown.

It's not a zero-sum game though. There's millions of networks that have yet to be quantified, doesn't mean the value is not there. If the barrier to entry is low to exchange value (as with cryptocurrencies between each other), holding value in one network, is simply a "vote" where you want your value to reside. Or rather in what network effect you want it to sit.
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:09:17
You buy it back at the price you close it right? So, if the price is goes higher, they might either decide to cut their losses and buy it at a higher price than they borrowed. OR they decide to borrow more to short (at a higher price), in the hopes that if it goes down, they cover the losses of their original short position?
Is that correct? However, what I'm still not entirely sure. A lender only lends his BTC. They get interest regardless since the guy opening the short has to close it at some stage right? A lender hopes that the coins they are selling is closed at a higher position (since then they make more)?
Lending is separate from a long as well right? A long is the opposite? You borrow USD to buy BTC now?

That's correct. You own the keys to change the ledger.
However, some wallet providers keep your keys safe (if you think you can't keep them safe by yourself: which isn't exactly easy even for techie people).
Providers such as Coinbase, Xapo and Circle provide insurance (various scales) for your Bitcoin. They keep the keys safe, and if they get hacked they will return your Bitcoin. By "return", their insurance will pay out, they will buy new Bitcoin and reimburse you.

Really awesome. I think one of the cooler features about payment channels is that it allows to a greater extent actors (client + server) to stay honest during transactions that relate to any kind of "metered" service. If any side just disappears (through intent or error), both get what they paid for up to that point. So for a server (that's providing a service), there's more incentive for them to stay honest and keep providing a service.
For example. Let's imagine a future where self-driving, electric cars own themselves. They have to recharge at a local electric station. Using payment channels, they can (if properly implemented), pay per charge. If the electric station is being a dick, they already paid for what they charged. There's even lower counterparty risk.

Part of my thinking is that, because money is also partly a tool to solve problems of social coordination, it can be unconsciously jarring if people start valuing new "internet, digital tokens" as valuable (or any new form of value exchange token). 
It means that if you switch, all those remaining in fiat lose group social cohesion. They need to do effort to research Bitcoin in case their own money loses value, and this is frustrating, and reduces social coordination (you aren't accepting my paper money as much as you value Bitcoin). This reduces their capability to enact in a social setting.
It's like religion. People unconsciously "shut down" any religion that isn't theirs, since both money and religion work better with a larger network effect.
tl;dr it introduces social effort.

Ethereum has a dynamic limit based on gas usage (basically, how many transactions per block). It can scale up and down. Worth looking into.
@_date: 2015-05-27 09:29:21
Ethereum is going to experiment with a blocksize (or rather the gas limit in a block) that scales based on usage. You can't pump in a 20mb block when usual blocks are 1mb. If the network isn't being used much, the accepted blocks will naturally downscale. It does not solve all the issues related to blocksize, but there's no pressure to hard fork changes every time it needs to happen.

Some of these will work okay/fine with Counterparty, but if you are a dev and have tried to make Counterparty do what you want it to AND easily add additional functionalities (I tried this in 2014), you'll know how difficult it is.

Much easier to do what we want to do. For now, it's quite simple. The smart contract automatically disburses Ether to the owners of the song, and then registers in a tx log what type of policy was paid for (currently supporting normal downloads, and downloads for stems). Each policy has different payout percentages, owners &amp; price. I suspect with some effort you could potentially do this with Bitcoin? I haven't done Bitcoin/Counterparty/Colored Coins coding in a while, so not sure. You might have to build additional software that monitors the chain for certain information (Ethereum has this built in).
In the future we want to support arbitrarily complex policies. Things such as 1) groups voting to confer rights or 2) a crowdfund automatically buying into a pre-release of a song to become a fan-based owner of it. This will be prohibitively difficult with Bitcoin. Too many moving parts. Might have to also even build supporting networks (like OpenBazaar needs to do with their own DHTs).

The era of inflation to create growth was a reasonable way to contend with the sudden spike in human population in the 70's ( It's why I'm not totally against the current inflationary, debt driven way to create growth. It had its place, because we needed to grow faster than any other previous time in history. By artificially pumping up the flow of 'blood' in the system, the system could be kept alive.
But now we are almost close to drowning because of this. It's time to change and move away from rampant growth as the definition of success of a nation. Sustainability should be the new prime definition of success, and Bitcoin helps in this regard.

According to the wiki, it seems that higher fees gets priority ("Then transactions that pay a fee of at least 0.0005 BTC/kb are added to the block, highest-fee transactions first, until the block is not more than 250.000 bytes big.")  
  
Looking at blockchain.info there was a recent block with size of 146kb. It varies wildly though. There doesn't seem to be strict competition just yet, but it will happen eventually.
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:22:18
Just encountered the same error. Really stupid of them to use "hyper" exchange rates. I paid a certain amount and forgot to include a tx fee (my bad). So I thought it won't confirm immediately, I'll have to just wait a bit. And then when you go back, it recalibrates the price. Bad UX. Now I'm just waiting for six confirmations, before I send HiB an email. I reported to Coinbase as well (on the item itself).
@_date: 2013-07-29 16:04:58
Currently due to block space not being that contentious, processing 'faster' won't be that competitive. If you pay the required fee, it will be processed as quickly as possible.
If you DO want to pay a higher fee when block space becomes competitive, you will currently have to just guess. There are plans however to include variable tx fees so that when the time comes when it is more important, you can see what tx fee will be needed for your transaction to be completed as quickly as possible. (Sort of like a built-in market for fees).
There are solutions also proposed such as just lifting the block-space limit, but this will increase the block size faster. I don't think there is consensus yet. Haven't been to clued up recently on what the core devs are planning.
For now. If you pay the minimum fee that Bitcoin-QT or other wallets recommend, your transaction should be in the next block.

Yes, fractional reserve banking can be applied to Bitcoin. And it would probably work quite well. The only difference is, is that banking is stripped away from governments. A government has too much interest in keeping banks up with their own currency, and hence we see things like massive bailouts happening and "too big to fail". It is a separation of concern. Just like it is ideal to separate church and state. Separate banking from state.

Another thing. Cash transactions are instant. Bitcoin isn't. Imagine standing in front of a guy in a market, waiting for the transaction to verify? Won't work. Been thinking of how to solve this.   
   
One way could be to sign off somehow (due to close proximity), that you pay that amount. Something perhaps to do with allowing you to sign transactions (deeper down), or embed some sort of keys in the transaction.   
   
Not entirely sure how. But, because the people are standing next to each other, that HAS to account for something, that although it will eventually confirmation in 10-20 minutes, they don't have to wait.

A bank has a purpose. It can do stuff like keep your money safe, it can do loans, and eventually end up where we are today with larger banks, doing fractional reserve banking. This is useful. And a bank should be allowed to take these risks (like fractional reserve banking).  
  
However, the problem comes in when a government controls the monetary supply (which is currently the whole world). A government prints the money. They don't just 'print' them, literally. The large banks in the country gets the money, and is then allowed to do what they want (usually fractional lending). This way, the money gets into the country's financial system. It filters from the top, down.  
  
However when banks fuck up (ie 2008), a government (or state) is too closely tied to the banks. If the banks fail, the government loses its power, because its currency is the same currency the banks use. It thus has incentives to sustain it: 'too big to fail'.  
  
A bank should be allowed to fail if it took the wrong risks. However, currently, the money printers (the governments) can't let that happen, because it devalues their lifeblood.  
  
Separate state's influence on banks. Whether this is feasible remains to be seen, it just feels like the better approach at this stage.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:39:21
How will it be adjusted? If you want transactions to confirm faster you are going to have to pay 'above' the average price. And currently 0.0005 BTC / KB isn't dynamic. The expected transaction fee needs to conform to market standards as well.
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:59:11
The miners choose what fees to accept. In the future they will only make money from transaction fees, so it is in their interest to keep the market alive by allowing transaction fees. The market should correct itself. If no one wants to accept very low tx fees, but there is a huge market for it, a newcomer could come along and accept them. This is also why there is incentive for miners to accept 0 fee transactions. They might be de-prioritised, but they keep the ecosystem going.
So I don't really see how you can collude to raise transfer fees. The other beauty as well, is altcoins. IF somehow it did become feasible, people can ship to other altcoins that aren't forcing out low-fee transactions.
In terms of prices. This is manipulatable like any free market. If you have the money, you could for example pump and dump.

I know 6-confirmations is the standard ('beyond reasonable doubt'). I know some use 3-confirmations. Is 1-confirmation fine? In this case, double-spending a 1-confirmation will take considerable hashing power, right? So for low value transactions, it wouldn't be feasible, right (to double-spend)? If a site can accept the risk, then 1-confirmation should be fine?

This has been discussed before: 
  
imho. A market for fees seems to me the best best (going into the future).
Users set their own minimum tx fee. Miner/pools decide what limit they will process (some apparently already 'skip' low value transactions). Gather market data, and show that IF you pay above this, chances are that it will definitely be included in the next block, creating 'tiers'. If miners collude to 'hike' the tx fee prices, hopefully other miners/pools will start accepting the large amount of low-tx fee transactions because the rest of the market won't. Haven't had time to properly think if there are loopholes to this. Anyone?

No worries. Love to help!


As I mentioned previously, the whole Bitcoin network consists of a set of blocks that contain the transactions. Close to 250k blocks have been created so far. This 'ledger' is being shared amongst clients so users are up to date on what is spendable and what is not.
When you turn on Bitcoin-QT after a while, it needs to get the latest blocks to get back up to date on where the 'ledger' is at this stage. This can take a while as the official wallet act as a full verification node (that help the network). There are SPV (simple payment verification) clients that sync in less than a minute. They don't contribute fully to the Bitcoin network and only check if a tx is valid or not. Check out Multibit (recommended SPV client).


This a bit more technical and I might be a bit rusty on the details. In order to have any priority (besides zero priority), transactions have to fit into certain conditions. One is the size of the transaction. It is not related to the amount of Bitcoin (although it can be). A transaction consist of inputs and outputs. Think of it this way. If I want to pay someone $75 dollar, but I only have 2 $50 dollar notes, I need 2 'inputs' that are equal to $50. The outputs will be the $75 dollar to the other person and a $25 'change' to you. Now sometimes, due to Bitcoin's easy divisibility, the inputs can a be a lot. If you have loads of 0.001 addresses and you need to pay someone 0.1 BTC, it will need 100 (0.001) addresses, increasing the inputs needed. This increases the physical 'size' of the transaction (extra bytes). The rules built into the official wallet state that you must pay a set amount of bitcoin per kilobyte (default is 0.0001/kb).
If you paid 0.0028 and paid a 0.0001 fee (according to Bitcoin-QT) then it should not have taken an hour for the first confirmation to appear. The only way that could happen is if the 0.0001 fee was actually not enough and thus even if you DID pay a fee, the transaction was demoted to a zero priority. I'm not sure what happened here. Could be how QT does things.
Transactions confirm as soon as a miner solves the block that was in the that transaction. More confirmations are more secure.

Wow. Did you try this with a 0.8.2? I was running 0.8.2 client on a micro instance on EC2 and it kept crashing due to memory problems. I know 0.8.3 fixed some issues with low memory clients crashing, but haven't tested it with a micro instance yet. If it can run fine a pi, then it would run fine on a micro EC2 instance.

1) Afaik, the current idea is to do away with max block size entirely (
2)  (very, very genious). The idea could possibly lead to the development of a separate chain handling micro-transactions and Bitcoin being a summarised value store.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:30:28
No it won't. Not yet.
I've been thinking about this. I'm from South Africa (and in the tech space), so my ear is always on the ground. 
Bitcoin as an idea has massive potential for Africa. Remittance is a massive market for Africa (hence one of the reasons for M-Pesa's success). Few people have bank accounts or even credit cards. Visa, et al is only now waking up to Africa. A VC in Kenya told me all over in East Africa (Kenya and Tanzania) and Nigeria there's billboards for credit cards. In every airport you seem them. They want to grab the market now that they are coming online and technologically savvy.
The problems with Bitcoin however: Large blockchain. Africa is the mobile-first generation. They are doing their banking through their phones, surfing and buying stuff through their phones. Smartphones are "always" coming. The problem however is not that cheap smartphones exist. The problem is lack of electricity. Nokia's sell a lot more because of their battery life. They'd rather have a phone that works, than a smartphone with a 1 day battery life.
Keeping up to the date with the network means staying connected (and requires bandwidth). Having to download and sync with the blockchain might cost more than what it is worth.
These are however problems that will eventually phase out. If they do, and Africa wakes up, it's going to be big.

Yep. The miner decided to not include any transactions. They can, if they want to. I suspect the only consideration would be bandwidth, but it is so negligible to just include extra transaction (that has fees)?

Yep. It also makes trading of BTC doable outside of the blockchain. The way I'm thinking: there must be a way to simply securely trade private keys to established public addresses (with certain denominations). Would be cool if it can be done. It's a difficult problem though.

The problem with low value transactions is that it might take too long to confirm. If someone buys something on the site, you want the transaction to confirm as quickly as possible. We will be an intermediary, so someone else needs to be paid as well. And therefore we want that to happen as fast as possible as well. Sending transactions without transaction fees in our case just isn't feasible (on low value transactions).
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:06:48
Not sure where you are from or whether it's actually being used there (perhaps with another name). Airtime = prepaid phone. You buy say $30 worth of airtime. Then you can use that amount of data/sms/calls until it's up. This is used instead of a contract. A lot phones in Africa is based on this model, because people can't afford to pay contracts.

A transaction is instant, and almost immediately appears on the receiver's account. To understand a confirmation, you have to understand a bit more on how the underlying architecture of Bitcoin works. I'm not sure how much you know, so I'm going to elaborate.
All the transactions on the Bitcoin network are put into blocks that are roughly separated by 10 minute increments. When you do a transaction it is usually in the current block, and then becomes an 'unconfirmed' transaction. Once a miner solves the 'difficult math puzzle' (I'll elaborate more on this if you want) for that block, the transaction gets 1 confirmation. Now after your transaction has been done, new transactions occur across the Bitcoin network, and gets into the new block. Once that block gets confirmed, the transactions that are already a block 'deep' are now at 2 confirmations, and the latest transactions are at 1 confirmation. So, as time goes on, transactions get more and more confirmations.
Without going into too much technical detail, more confirmations means higher security. This is because to spoof the network you have to do more and more computation per chain of blocks. Solving the 'math puzzle' for one block is easier than having to solve the 'math puzzle' for 2 blocks in a row (that is what you have to do). 3 in a row is more difficult and so forth.
Relating to transaction fee. TX is just short for transaction. Paying a fee gives your transaction priority on the network. Currently, the priority is not that big a deal as the amount of transactions aren't high enough that you won't be included in the next block if you pay any sort of fee (for most transactions). It is accepted to pay between 0.0001 to 0.0005 BTC currently. Bitcoin-QT should automatically add the required tx fee (even if it is not needed) to support the miners and keep the Bitcoin network flourishing.
Hope that helps! Hope it wasn't too much. If you have any more questions, shoot.

Love this quote:  
  
"Aside from being an often superior method of payment, Bitcoin has also come to serve another function: that of a signalling device. By accepting Bitcoin, what thousands of merchants, employers and employees are saying is: I support the ideals behind Bitcoin, including internationality, decentralisation, individual liberty and the power of technology to make the world a better place, and I want to interact with other people who share those values."
I absolutely agree. It sort of starts filtering into the ideals of technotarian-ism coined Jason Calacanis (
"We made this term up to describe the “good people” of the internet who believe in the fundamental rights of individuals to be free, have free speech, fight hypocrisy and stand behind logic, technology and science over religion, political structure and tradition. These are the people who build and support things like Wikileaks, Anonymous, Linux and Wikipedia. They think that people can, and should, govern themselves."
I always try to avoid circle-jerking, so sorry about this paragraph: I see that we as developers and techies, are the sculptors of the 21st century. We contribute to things that exist beyond petty nation-states to empower humanity. We build open source software, we contribute knowledge to a freely editable Wikipedia, and now we can empower ourselves financially through cryptocurrencies. They all are based on the idea that as humanity, we are better when we pool our resources. That has always been our strength. In a global world, we are citizens of the world, so lets work together to build artefacts that benefits all of us. Because we can.

I don't get this approach though. Bitcoin is supposed to in the future support sites like SatoshiDice. If 'spammy' micro-transactions is a problem, then where will you draw the line? The blockchain size will increase, and Bitcoin will have to deal with a large increase in transactions/per second.

There was an issue with with how older clients handled some new blocks (they couldn't). This caused a fork between new (0.8) and old (0.7) clients. The network would've worked itself out on its own (by basically forcing 0.7 clients to upgrade to the 0.8 version), but due to backwards compatibility, the bitcoin community (largest miners) collectively decided to continue with the 0.7 chain instead of the 0.8 chain.  
   
So. Forks will usually work itself out. I don't think there's been a case where it hasn't.

Transactions are basically instant, but confirmation takes longer. Usually in a merchant situation, performing a double-spend is really difficult (almost impossible). If the person is standing in front of you with a phone app, you can reasonably accept the tx without any confirmations. It's even more 'safer' and better than accepting credit cards, because you get the funds relatively immediately AND the person can't do any chargebacks afterwards.
EDIT: Note. Check for a tx fee at the very least. It is still possible to double-spend, but it becomes even less likely.
@_date: 2013-09-03 13:41:22
As far as I understand it, it doesn't matter if the nonce's starting point is the same because the miner's tx will change the hash completely.

This is a really big problem. Value of Bitcoin rises, transaction fees get more competitive, making any sort of micro-transactions meaningless.   
   
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:37:55
How are you setting prices?
Bitcoin's value is mostly tied to the dollar atm. So. Are you using that as a metric? Is it changing constantly (with the rising trends?)
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:06:05
For sites like Coinbase or Inputs.io, when users transfers between accounts, these sites simply in a centralized db change the numbers. They don't use the Bitcoin network. So there are transactions that can occur that don't use the network.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:56:08
That is a solution to solving it, yes. But there is still a problem with rising BTC value and micro transactions. The people buying something will have to decide whether they want it fast or not. Buying a 1 dollar item with a tx fee that could potentially be up to 10%-20% of the price, is pointless.   
   
From a user experience perspective, that's not ideal. It will be faster and easier to just pay with USD.
@_date: 2013-08-15 19:59:32
Absolutely. The barrier to entry for trying ideas makes it really great towards MVPs. Have an e-commerce idea and want to test it? Quickly implement a BTC solution, see if the market adopts it, and then you can choose to go ahead and employ more difficult implementations if you would choose to do so.  
  
It's programmable money. It's great.

I've thought about this (being from South Africa). Pay airtime for Bitcoin's. This is easy-ish, technically. In terms of UX it might still be jarring (accessing the wallet? what interface? sms? ussd? etc).

They are able to provide airtime to people when they request it (ie nano-loans). That itself is a rather brilliant idea. So technically, it's not impossible. Go for it!

We are thinking of branching into content discovery, but it doesn't quite seem like something that will bring you sustainable advantage (from a business point of view). You'll have to do it alongside other currencies. Or in other words, Bitcoin as a tool doesn't help in making content discovery better.
