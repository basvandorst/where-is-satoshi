He didn't say to buy luxury cars because you're some sort of car enthusiast, but so you can parade it around like a trophy. Jay Leno for example is a car enthusiast, most new millionaires who buy lamborghinis and other luxury cars do it only so they can attract airhead bimbos and show off. This kind of consumption is a very stupid way to lose money. The cost versus the benefit merely cancel out.

I wouldn't be surprised at all by this. A new episode's torrent is uploaded(as in, it's ready to download) almost as soon as the episode finishes- not a minute later.

I imagine that this is what shallow/primitive plebs(lel do u even lift.  tell themselves to justify their attraction to other shallow things and people. I suppose that you'll tell me next that dumb/b*tchy but so-called hot women should be preferable over plain Janes who are likely a better fit because 'volution said that people should be led by their peepees.

I can't find thread's link, but I believe he bought a house or something. The guy who bought the pizzas also spent 80,000+ BTC on Pizza (  ).
