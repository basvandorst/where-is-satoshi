Symbiont and Counterparty are two different entities. However, Symbiont employs the entire core Counterparty team.
I do agree that the ecosystem is entering a new phase of build-out and adoption. Indeed, there is a lot of interest in Bitcoin and blockchains in general from numerous established entities. Very exciting times!

Bloomberg article: 
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:04:03
to add to what romerun said, here's what I posted on the wired article comments: 
near instant trades can happen "off-chain", which is how centralized exchanges work on bitcoin today (e.g. btc-e, or bitstamp). The exchange could maintain a share reserve from deposits, and would enable very fast trades. Then, there could be settlement to the blockchain on either some regular basis, and/or when people "cashed out" from the exchange.
In the case of Counterparty, the overstock security would just be another asset, much like XCP, LTBCOIN, SWARM, SJCX (StorjCoin), and others that already exist today. The legal and regulatory framework around it would be different of course in numerous regards, but the underlying technical specifics would be the same.
And -- if it was permissible by law -- Overstock's digital asset could even be traded on the same exchanges that the Bitcoin community uses and trusts today (such as bitstamp, mintpal, btc-china, and more), as an alternative to totally "trust-less", decentralized trading on Counterparty's DEx (decentralized exchange). This is exactly how things work with XCP (the Counterparty currency) today.

Our opinion doesn't count as much as others here. Our job is to create the technology, in a manner that is open to others using it in a variety of ways. That's the power of an open source platform and a collaborative movement like Counterparty.

Great to see this kind of integration on Counterparty! :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:40:11
Depends on your definition of success. Given that we built Counterparty from nothing, with no outside funding, and it now boasts a number of VC backed companies, Overstock, and more, I would consider that at least some degree of success. :D
Beyond that, concepts like smart contracts, dynamic token creation, decentralized trading *are* materializing and *will* change the face of finance and law (and more) as we know it. Nothing can stop this, and Counterparty is definitely playing a large role here.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:07:51
Thanks Taariq. Taariq was one of the first businesses (if not the first) building on Counterparty technology. The whole point of Counterparty is to create an open platform that allows others (businesses, individuals, etc) to build on and utilize the technology to do some really cool stuff. Digital Tangible Trust is a perfect example of that.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:37:31


Thank you. Tim Swanson is a great source of information, especially regarding competitive analysis.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:32:43
that was actually a quote by me (Robby), and yes, with Counterparty, in order to sell an asset, you have to actually own it. All trades (and all derivatives, such as binary options and contracts for difference) are fully collateralized.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:03:18
I can't answer the first part of your question, unfortunately.
Regarding mobile device support, Counterwallet includes it, and there we may see a dedicated separate mobile wallet in the near to mid future.

Counterparty co-founder here. While I haven't read through the code closely yet or tested it, I just wanted to point out that this is actually great to see, and is exactly why we ported over Ethereum's contracts featureset to Counterparty. Counterparty's contracts can be cleanly and quickly implemented by *anyone*, and it's awesome to see Vitalik take the first stab here!
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:35:40
From the article: *"Another approach, the one I prefer, would be to build features in discrete, minimalistic steps. One addition would not require another. For instance, we could try several implementations of betting (with oracles, multisig, or sidechains) without breaking a solid implementation of assets. There could be more diverse community input, more modularity, more choices. And there would be a less monolithic organization dictating protocol changes and hard forks at whim."*
This is one of the primary purposes of the smart contracts system: to allow new innovations (new betting systems, hedging contracts, etc), without requiring low level protocol work and/or modifications.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:50:13
Just like people that would benefit from the creation of 15 million more "Bitcoin" would fork the bitcoin code and run that. The question is: who else would use their fork?
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:30:10
They know that this technology is coming, and that it's going to be disruptive. The question is: what side of the disruption will they be on? :)

You are more than welcome to host a CP torrent, just as Jeff Garzik does for the bitcoin blockchain.
Thanks for the idea, re: serpent

We have to remain rather tight lipped around Medici, but we would like to have the readers consider that the size of the stock market is estimated as [$55 trillion]( and the bond market size is estimated at [nearly $100 trillion]( Not only we, but several individuals we know (who are involved very deeply with the financial industry in large firms at executive levels) feel that in the near future, most, if not all financial instruments like stocks and bonds will be traded on a blockchain of some sort. Just let that sink in... That is the potential here!

Currently an up-to-date counterpartyd database is hosted at Amazon S3, updated nightly, and used by the build scripts. The link to it is [here](

Development of this is currently paused to work on other items. We hope to take it back up soon. The community is welcome to contribute in the meantime.

romerun, I know you've been following Counterparty for so long...I'm sure you know how characteristically tight lipped we are about future big developments! ;)

An “Etherparty” group has already formed on Skype, and are exploring this exact thing.
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:56:37
We have not received any letters or notice from the SEC, the NY DFS, or any other regulatory agency. The Bitlicense (given the most recent clarifications) relates primarily to transmission and storage of digital currencies. Our views on the Bitlicense are similar to those articulated by Jeremy Allaire of Circle in his [blog post]( in August. In short, we feel that some amount of regulation is a given, but regulators must understand that Blockchain technology is both young, inherently different than traditional financial tools, and something that can be extremely beneficial to society. Their regulatory approach should be balanced, nuanced, and take these factors into account.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:30:27
The feature [is planned]( Feel free to add a bounty to it (which you can do right from the github issue page itself), and hopefully it will be picked up and implemented sooner.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:15:52
there was a spreadsheet someone made that looked at all of these side by side (quantitatively, at least), but unfortunately I can't find the link....

Sidechains still seem to be 12-18+ months out. Once we see the tech start to materialize, we'll be in a better position to see the exact level of involvement Counterparty can have with the technology. As it is, there are several big security concerns we have with sidechains (merged mining, etc) that will need to be clarified/resolved. And yes, Counterparty can run on a sidechain, technically, but there is a *huge* security advantage to running on mainnet, especially for the lower-frequency, higher value type financial transactions that are our target.
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:17:39
That's not true. There are 3 individuals with this ability right now. For security reasons, we purposefully keep it to a small group (similar to Bitcoin in that regard). However, it's not just one person.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:38:52
counterparty co-founder here. sidechains are still under design and development. There is no reason at the moment to consider this, although we have talked with Adam Back and Austin Hill a bit about side chains.
with Counterparty, one of our most important priorities is proven security. Embedded consensus on the main Bitcoin chain offers just that, as every counterparty transaction is also a bitcoin transaction. If and when a sidechain comes out that a) offers a level of security at least equal to that of the primary Bitcoin chain, b) has several advantages to the primary chain (such as much quicker block times and/or lower fees) and c) has better scalability than the main chain, then we will consider it...but a. and b. (and c.) normally work against each other, so I'm personally a bit skeptical there.
that being said, as Counterparty is a system that sits on top of an existing blockchain implementation, one of our distinct advantages is our ability to move to a different blockchain (and/or support multiple blockchains, if necessary). This makes us not tied to the rise and potential fall of any blockchain implementation in particular.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:06:02
In addition to what Adam said, there are other plans to help make the codebase even more mature an extensible. counterblockd (the companion to counterpartyd), for instance, has a planned plugin system: where others will be able to write plugins for the product, that can parse through the counterparty data in a variety of ways, dynamically extend the counterblock API, and more. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:25:54
Bitcoin has a 5+ billion market cap now. Working on the bitcoin code is, to (ab)use an analogy I've made earlier, like changing a tire on a 10 ton dump truck going down the road at 50mph. One does not just slap Counterparty into bitcoind and call it a day. With (relatively) mature blockchains like Bitcoin, this functionality is best left to an additional layer on top of the core blockchain technology. This is exactly what Counterparty is.

We have a thread on exactly how this EVM Safeguard should work here: 
Please feel free to participate
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:38:13
Those docs will be forthcoming, as to the Counterparty specifics. The rest is just writing contracts in Solidity.
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:37:00
it is a Counterparty-specific port. There have had to be numerous changes necessary to get the EVM and Solidity to work on Counterparty/Bitcoin, but we intend to maintain source-level compatibility as much as possible via practices like modularizing out the changed code and submitting pull requests back to the parent repositories where possible.
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:34:56
The term "particularly useful" is rather subjective. These smart contracts cannot send bitcoin, but using BTCrelay (which could be built-in in the future) the smart contracts could verify and perform actions based on the existence and validity of BTC transactions (i.e. read only instead of read-write). Moreover, as has been stated, the contracts can work with any Counterparty asset.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:56:04
This is the port of the newest EVM code, which is much more mature and ready for "real world" use. In hindsight, the older announcement was realistically more of a proof of concept, given the early state of the EVM at the time. Also, this work is adding in additional crucial features lacking in the initial announcement (CP asset interop, potential EVM "Safeguard" at least initially, etc), with the definite goal of a mainnet release.

Counterparty co-founder here. I'd like to add Ivana Zuber to the list, who is our General Manager, as well as being VP of Communications at Symbiont. She's one of the hardest working people (male or female) I've ever met, and is an immense asset to our teams. She also has a CS degree and has a great ability to bridge technical and non-technical communication. Definitely a great example of a highly talented woman in Bitcoin!

@_date: 2016-05-10 22:56:05
it supports execution of Ethereum smart contracts (e.g. written in Solidity) as the execution environment (the EVM) is ported over. You are correct that this does not run on "the Ethereum network".
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:49:04
One of the Counterparty co-founders here. Seeing this on the bitcoin reddit frontpage is great, and it's nice to see a high quality mobile alternative to Counterwallet being developed. Have it on my iphone and have been trying it out. :)
One suggestion: on the receive page, make it so that the bitcoin address can be selected and copied. (Actually, now I see that's possible by double-tapping the QRcode, but intuitively, I tried to double tap the address text, and wanted to see a "select", then "copy" controls, as with text in the browser)
