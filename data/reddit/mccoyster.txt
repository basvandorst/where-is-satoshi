Don't worry. We are very likely not finished with this correction. Hope I am wrong, but I suspect we have much further to go down before we truly settle. Just a hunch, though.

They'll find out soon enough when we slowly go back to 5k, perhaps even lower.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:30:43
I'm lazy and busy so could be wrong, but a drop from 20k to 3k would be a larger swing than 1200 back to 250, I think?

The more profitable mining is, generally speaking, the more downward pressure you will see on the price. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:37:06
True, but it does in ways increase the need for miners to offload their coins. As their profit margin dwindles and the reward coins are spread among more miners, less miners can afford to hold their coins.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:31:14

Not really sure how to, tbh? Might look into it, though. Can you place a multi-year short that triggers once it goes below a certain price?
Long term I'm bullish, so buying and HODL'ing now. But still expect we're going to see much lower lows. At least sub-8k, I'd say a very high likelihood we go sub 5k too this year or next. Don't want to risk losing my coins if I'm wrong and we moon again, but...might have to look into shorting. : )

You can do that for bitcoin losses as well, if you sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:24:31
Well, right, there are no gains or losses until you sell. But, if you buy at 10k and sell at 1k, you write those loses off (just as with other commodities). If you don't sell, you don't pay gains or take loses on taxes.

Sure, but governance is done (generally) by the consent of those who came before you.
The world isn't perfect. What should we do, everytime there is a new person born, hold a new continental congress to make sure they consent and we can have their input? It just doesn't work like that.
It's the same with parents. Nobody chose to be born, and they don't generally consent to their parents rules, but they have to follow them. Until they don't. And then they can leave. Except, we're all out of open space to create your own "home", in this analogy, so you get to pick from the existing homes already created. Or you can try to mold yours, or another one, into a system more befitting what you believe in/want to see.
What you don't get to do, is stay in that "home", and yet say, "The rules don't apply to me, I didn't agree to them, but I'm not leaving".

Then get on a tiny little boat, and paddle your ass out into the ocean. You don't get to choose whether you join society or not, anymore. If you are born in a country, you are a part of it. Once you're old enough, if you don't want to be governed, have fun finding a place where that doesn't happen and enjoy living in chaos. Every day you remain in this (or whatever country/society you are in), you are agreeing to be a part of this/that society.

It doesn't matter. Your Bitcoin (and mine) have unequivocally lost value, whether you sell or not. And, I'm still net positive, so mine have gained value from when I bought them. But have lost value too since the peak.

Also, I presume, commodities were the original asset class? Is the originator still seen as the most authentic store of value, or even preferred? Or any other asset class for that matter. The first stock? The first bond? Humans have been attaching value to physical goods for thousands of years. And while some are still with us, many of what I imagine were the originators of that asset class are not seen as modern stores of value worthy of investment. But I'm no economist, just a nerdy IT dude that has seen many first movers come and go. : )
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:36:30
Nice! Yeah, I dunno if I heard it somewhere, or just came up with it, but I tend to tell people that when first explaining it to them, and why despite the seemingly high prices currently, it's still "early". I see us being in a similar period for cryptocurrencies as the world was during the 70's/80's. The dotcom boom is still far in the future.
Could be wrong, though. We could be in the dotcom boom now, too. *shrugs* It's certainly not a perfect analogy, nor am I wise enough to know which leg of adoption and explosion we're in. Had I been wiser, I wouldn't be at work right now. ; P

@_date: 2017-11-28 01:06:23
Hrm, I would still consider bones and stones (precious or otherwise) to essentially be a commodity though. That was my point. What was once the most common and accessible store of value or medium of exchange is no longer that. The first paper currency, I imagine, is long dead too. 
As for the mistake, I think we are all bound to make it. Nobody has experience in the unexperienced or unknown. All we can do is take what we know and try to predict what we don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:40:58
Bitcoin is also code. Code tends to age worse than companies do. While I think it's first mover advantage will carry it for awhile, and possibly with second and third layer tech added on top it will survive and thrive for many years, but I still don't see it being the top crypto by market cap in 50 years. I'd be surprised if it is in 10 years, to be honest. 
The network may continue indefinitely, and surely people may still use it. But will it always be at the top in our lifetimes? I find that hard to imagine. And a store of value that is useless if the world goes dark, I don't imagine, will ever replace physical stores of value entirely.

@_date: 2017-11-28 00:40:35
Kudos to you! I just did the same, but for a vastly smaller scale. Well, I didn't cash out completely, only about 1/5th the total value. But it was to pay debt, because, while I do feel Bitcoin will continue to rise and has a promising future...reaping some real world impact of the gains became more and more important as the price rises. To anyone here before the goxxening, you know. Seeing four figures become five figures become four figures again, practically over night was...intense. Probably won't happen again like it did then, but...1000% increases can only happen for how many years in a row before one Bitcoin is worth more than all the money in the world?
Be sane. Don't over extend yourself. When I first invested, I stuck by the "don't invest more than you're willing to lose". I imagine many people who started at that point, now have more invested than they are willing to lose (or should be), even if it is all gains.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:36:31
Absolutely. While possible, the idea that Bitcoin will exist in 50 years, in the same form or without major changes as it does today, is insanely naive to me. Cryptocurrencies almost certainly will, Bitcoin though? Unlikely.
And yeah, I do the same. Percentage and USD wise, I'm still mostly in Bitcoin. But as alts spring up that look interesting, especially while they're still relatively cheap, it's worth the risk to me to buy some. So now I think I hold like...almost 20 different coins? Some I might only have 20$ in, and if I lose it, oh well. But I don't think anyone can accurately predict what coin or platform will truly win in the end. Best to just ride the waves and try to make some money and get lucky down the road, imho. : )
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:33:39
Yep. Getting in during then end of 2013 before the first big spike, and then buying a little here and there manually over the next year or two. I never bought at the lows, always the highs or middles. Had I just set up a weekly buy, I imagine my holdings in coins would have been doubled for the same money invested. When BTC would drop from 600 to 300, and you were already invested "enough", you felt, it was nearly impossible to justify buying more on a downswing.

The answer is, "trading bitcoin isn't taxable". The act of trading crypto doesn't itself cause a taxable event inherently. Or rather, it does, but it only matters if you're gaining or losing value on the trade (capital gains/losses).
So, if you bought WoW gold and it appreciates over time in some way, I suspect you'd be responsible to pay the same taxes.
The reason you haven't heard of this being a problem for anyone is also similarly simple, nobody got rich off selling their old forgotten WoW gold.

@_date: 2018-02-08 15:45:08
Yeah, each crypto has to have some kind of limit to its price. New coins might still moon over various time-periods. But whatever coin "wins", will still get to a certain price and stay pretty much there. A continually rising market cap that essentially "prints" value for no reason isn't much different than fiat currencies. 
Maybe 10k is the top reasonable price for bitcoin. Maybe it's 1 million a coin. Or somewhere in between. But it can't just go up in value indefinitely, and certainly not parabolic. Even in the most optimistic bitcoin-driven future, where it replaces all modern currencies, it will eventually find a stable price. As you said, after critical mass, there's simply no reason for it to continue growing in price. It doesn't produce or create anything of value itself.

You can relatively safely invest through Coinbase if you're in the US. They tend to get some hate, but I personally haven't had much of a problem using them.
