I think it's a great idea. I have a good understanding of blockchain and coding a private chain for a bank at the moment. I guess you know the event industry quite well so we can have some good synergies. Happy to help out and create a proof of concept.

Why would it have a value of 0? People can keep their coins in both chains and bet on two horses. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:50:34
True. Lol. It's expensive to be poor.

Why use such a complicated way? If you dont trust the exchange you buy Bitcoin, withdraw the Bitcoin (which takes max 30 mins) and sell your Bitcoin for a profit on Localbitcoins and you can have your money in a few hours.....

Its a pleasure to watch. In 15 mins they added 1459 BTC and $166k to their order book. Withdrawals / deposits working. The machine is humming. Am so happy this is not Gox 2.0. This could be a turning point for Bitcoin. Am in full trading mode again.

Yes, and this way you dont pay banking fees for the transfer either. It seems to me you have never used localbitcoins before. You put up an add, buyers find you. You dont need to meet them they can do a bank transfer straight into your bank account and you release the coins. You can have the money in your account in a few hours whereas through a bank it will take you at least 3 working days. I suggest you try it out.

You have to make a difference if you trust in Bitcoins or you trust an exchange. If you were a trader with 60 grand on Bitstamp I guess you believed in Bitcoins. If you dont trust Bitstamp but believe in Bitcoins the best way out is buy coins and withdraw your coins. It can be done in 5 mins. The fact that an exchange is hacked should not shake your trust in Bitcoins.

How long will it take to get to 700 you think? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:06:13
Fair point. I am planning to lower my total invested capital as my return falls below the return I get from my other investments but I take a 3 yearly average to compare my returns
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:45:47
Ok hope you are right. Will keep you guys posted
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:26:17
You are not foolish if you havent broken the following golden 2 rules:

Sorry but this will be won by mayweather

Guys i got inspired by you so I banged together a site that we can use for this. Here it is: 
I have added a job that will pay in BTC. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:14:53
This will have some big bad impact on the price and with that confidence of people.  Should we not be prudent and at least split in 2 chains? We have so much excess hash power. Our coins will be valid in both chains and at least we can hedge our bets?
@_date: 2016-01-22 10:34:02
You are confusing two concepts. The fed controlling the money supply means they can print more USD. The Chinese miners can't do this. There will only be 21m BTC. They also can not bring BTC in circulation faster. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:35:15
True, another reason to be in control of your own coins
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:23:28
If you don't reward miners their hash power will disappear. Then you are back to being a predistributed alt coin that is open to a 51% attack. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:01:16
Yes I do. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:16:50
Very true but that will be even more difficult than changing the block size. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:28:28
I am a small time miner and have been discussing this with a few people today. I still see that both sides between classic and core have valid arguments and considering the point at least part of my mining capacity to the losing fork as there is no clear winner for me yet. Most people think the fork with the least amount of mining capacity will disappear but even if mining splits 75%/25% the fork with the smallest capacity still has a chance o survive. Therefore this is indeed the best time to buy as your coins will be valid on both chains. After the fork you will have to choose with chain you buy them on. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:02:34
Care to elaborate? Maybe I can learn something. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:14:15
I agree. This will be interesting. Core can take the approach of different stacks like we have in the internet. Core will be the TCP/IP aka the settlement layer. The payment layer like HTTP will be build on top of that with more capacity. Fees in the settlement layer will rise which will force miners to include more transactions in blocks. These are the  ideas of core. The majority of mining will be in China. 
Bitcoin Classic will be low on transaction fees but require a high speed transport layer aka high speed Internet. This will be mainly mined in places with fast Internet such as the USA and South Korea. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:40:11
I agree that if both chains survive both will probably reduce in price (initially). However both could coexist just like we have many altcoins (litecoin, namecoin, etc.) now. They will have different use characteristics. Core maybe more focus on decentralization, classic more focused on supporting larger number of transactions, etc. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:22:40
You should not sell your coins but push for a fork. That way we keep our coins on both chains and we will see who wins. Hedge your bets. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:41:39
I agree with this. Esp your point that bitcoin should not be controlled by an oligopoly. Therefore let's create a fork that does not have this problem. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:30:37
Bitcoin records transactions. There are no coins to dump. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:56:15
Are you slowly waking up? 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:43:20


agree with you except your last sentence. Not sure based on what you come to that conclusion.
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:58:52
That's a very helpful and insightful comment. Are you panicking or pissed of you didn't short at 430?
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:42:27
Money brings the worst and best out of people. This can not be avoided. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:50:22
You are forgetting that there is also competition between states on currency. Read about currency wars. Bitcoin could become the neutral currency in which states trade with each other. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:52:26
What will be a better outcome for Bitcoin? I guess if they don't come to an agreement. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:06:02
If your transaction is delayed you could double spend it with a higher fee.
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:40:45
Don't know. Who? Tell us please. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:29:01
Hahaha. Could not stop laughing. This so funny. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:30:08
Thank you but I am getting pocket error. What am I doing wrong? 
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:30:59
Yes you only need 3 central banks to misrepresent their reserve dollar balance
@_date: 2015-11-15 20:00:29
But likely out to early...
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:10:56
Thank you so much
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:30:52
I am in the UK, will try with the financial ombudsman
@_date: 2015-10-22 09:21:30
I love every bit of it
@_date: 2015-10-17 03:59:34


This is incorrect. Bitcoin price is a function of user adoption. So even in Bitcoin as a settlement network halving will affect the price.

Nice name Bob

Thanks for the link. Will have a look

Why let the DAC just generate a random number? Why not let it run a lottery?
