they don't seem to accept credit cards or paypal as payment

I don't mind verification of ID but I want to buy bitcoins instantly with credit cards
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:52:10
I downloaded their wallet but seems it will take 1 day to sync the database? I have seen people talking about more than 2 days just to sync?
That's useless for people that are in a hurry to move stuff... I think my only option will be wallet...I don't even know how much GB will have to download...

It's just electronic automated operations you don't need a super computer for this lol. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:07:52
Thanks! So Segwit2x is what we should want as a end user and is also what is winning? That's great
Also can you be more clearer why the miners will not be able to compete? My PC is just a cpu + gpu and I thought the miners use the same hardware? 
If mining get cheaper = less incentive to people let their PC's running 24 hours to get a few cents

Hmm I don't really trust web wallets but I'll do some research...
What happens if my transaction is not confirmed in 10 minutes? Won't I have to pay a high fee to have it confirmed in 10 min? 
Also really grateful for your answers :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:32:44
So just do it, release it, and fuck if someone else disagrees that bitcoin has a issue.
If your solution is cheaper &amp; faster people will use it and it will have value. 
If I were a big miner, that was exactly I would do and fuck who disagrees. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:14:06
So there's no other way other than paying the abusive fees?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:06:10
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:31:34
Yeah I'm inclined to do this you said...
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:12:34
Can you please be more clearer? I don't understand much of about bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:05:54
I'm not interested in making money, just processing my own transactions so I can pay less on fees. But I'm not sure I understand what you said. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:24:13
Why litecoin?

Such a smart answer. Someone give this guy a ��

Convert it to another coin 
Wait to see which chain will be accepted
Why not? I don't see why person would hold bitcoins at this time...
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:40:07
Apparently using remote nodes is a privacy/security risk
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:06:29
So the recommended method now to tumble Bitcoin is buying monero and then Bitcoin again?
Does shapeshift allow transactions accessing with tor? Do I need to wait some time to avoid getting the same Bitcoin back?
Can I just but it from a exchange non anonymously and send directly to shapeshift ? Or is a middle men recommended?
Can electrum use monero? Sorry I never used monero. 
The standard way to tumble the bitcoins before you needed 3 wallets + a mixer. How can monero be better?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:13:15
I'm just the end user of bitcoin, so it's not really worthy my time.
In the end, I don't really care about a chain spliiting or whatever, as a end user I'll just use whatever blockchain is faster and have the cheapest fees. 
You think any end user of bitcoins like the &gt;90% of people that use it really care about this? We just want low fees and faster confirmations time and we will use whatever block chain achieves that 
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:50:11
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:17:37
No it's not bitching, is the reality. I bought 112 USD and after doing my mixing stuff for privacy and moving to a wallet I had only 98 USD. Then I paid something again and electrum wanted me to pay 4 USD for that.
Seriously, I don't know why anyone is using bitcoin it eats more money from you than the banks. They want to be digital cash but with real cash you don't lose money each time your use it 
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:21:29
So leave
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:23:00
In the end can't we just let the market control itself ? Like I said people don't care about this, we will use whatever is cheaper &amp; faster...
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:46:05
Most of the time when you buy something with bitcoins they have a timer and you can lose your money if you transaction don't get in time.
So Bitcoin is severely punishing poor users, and disproportionately eating the money of the poorest. 
If I buy 10 USD with bitcoins I will get around 9-8 USD after the fee of just buying bitcoins, then by moving to a offline wallet I lose around 1 USD again, then when paying for something that have a timer I lose at minimum 1 USD again. So yeah good luck trying to get poor people to adopt bitcoins 
So much for a coin that want to be adopted by everyone and fight against the banks... 
Bitcoin = pay 10 USD to buy it, expect to have around 6-7 USD usable after buying it, moving to a offline wallet and then paying something with it.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:16:22
And where I can read about all this? How can I join all into a single address? Won't I have to pay the fees for each address merging ? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 09:56:02
Thanks for sharing :)
Is there a tool for that to calculate the transference between many wallets? I want to know what to expect then tumbling with 3 wallets + helix
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:21:03
Understand the differences and what is going on sure...but I don't need the complex math details..that's why it's a ELI5 lol... 
Most people like me who use bitcoin have no ideia of wtf is going on 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:43:43
Glad I read this, I can now avoid poloniex like the plague! They are probably about do a exit scam 
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:05:46
The sense of entitlement implied in your answer is astonishing. Go back to trolling elsewhere. Maybe someone will care there. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:39:47
And which one is winning ? 
Why can't the miners just profit from that 2nd layer too? 
Thanks for actually answering my questions 
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:52:54
That's interesting...can you do that? Set up a mining PC just for mining your own transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:22:16
I'm not some virgin math genius. So I'm hostage of that complex math and there's just no easy way to know how much I need to pay for confirm it in X time 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:17:26
Most miners choose the transactions with most fees right? 
So it's not like I would be competing with too much others? Almost none will be looking to process my 0 fee transaction
