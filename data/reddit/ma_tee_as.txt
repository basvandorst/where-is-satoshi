No, that's just not true. That's what today's capitalism has become but it's not what a free  capitalism without any foul play would look like. It's the exact opposite. Inequality can be leveled out only with capitalism. This or by force when you just take away others people's belongings.

There is no extra money when you have a limited supply currency like Bitcoin. Profit is made and will be spend again for other goods and if it is not used well it will be redistributed to someone who does a better job than you do.

I mean corruption AND any sort of incentivized lobbyism free democracy, not mob rule.

Interesting thought

Banks hold whole states hostage and do absolutly nothing but fill their own pockets without providing any kind of good service.
That's why we need money to be seperated from banks and government.
That's why we need Bitcoin.

Some people think capitalism is bad when they actually mean "government backed capitalism with elitism, tax loopholes, monopolies and corruption capitalism" which is indeed the evil of this world.
Capitalism in combination with a true democracy is the only force that aligns the human's nature with progress in every aspect of live: food, technology, healthcare, wealth and many more.
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:55:18
I like that thought. I have to think it through though.
Implementation might be hard because very rich people can just move to another jurisdiction. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:22:18
But that's not *capitalism* then. That's my point.
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:45:20


That's true and with capitalism and a social safety net those people don't have to starve like they did in ancient times.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:33:14
Disagree a lot here. Then you have just babaric injustice and tribes where leaders provide protection and exploit people. Like in the animal kingdom. We are better than that.
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:40:23
That's why we need technology like the internet and blockchain to make information and access to financial services not a privilege anymore.
I am not saying we are there yet but technology donations, development aid together with capitalism can achieve this.


I refuse to believe that although I see where you are coming from.

Untill we have 100% renewable energy thanks to capitalism and entrepreneurship and replace power consuming bank facilities all over the world who consume even more energy.

That's exactly what I mean! I should check out Polanyi's writings then I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:06:07


That's not true in a free market. Free markets is were money flows around, not from bottom to top. That's what we currently have and this is NOT true capitalism. It's elitism who exploid capitalism and make laws and loopholes for themselfs to stay up there. We need to change that badly. That's exactly my point. People use the word "capitalism" to describe a corrupted version of it.

Did you use this before? I am not Bitcoin savvy enough to read through that github.
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:28:48
Hence my question how to do it if you'd want to do it.
Easy way would be to hand it to some sort of bank and make them lock it in a safe for 10 years.
But you get the irony with that, right?

That's what nTimeLock does yes. As I understood.

@_date: 2018-06-26 11:27:23
Maybe but maybe that's what people thought 700 years ago about the privileges of landlords, dukes and kings and stuff.
I see no better option, but I'll keep my eyes open.

Captialism and the *redistribution* of wealth go hand in hand.
Anyone at any time can start a business and do something better than someone else and make money by doing so.
- A sushi restaurant with better service who attracts customers of someone elses restaurant. By doing so people have a better overall service and the wealth of a poorly run 3th generation pizza place is redistrubuted to someone else and people have better food by doing so. And that's human's nature, to compete and make a living and achieve something.
- Amazon who provided better service for book readers first by sending them online with a huge variety of books. Bezos then extended that business to other goods and people all over the world have now almost the convenience of same day delivery for affordable prices. Wealth was redistributed from old bad service businesses to a new guy.
It's the tax loopholes, lobbyism etc that help Amazon to build a monopoly business. If enough people don't like a service they will just jump to someone who has a better service in their eyes and again wealth will be redistributed.
There are some exceptions and I am pro labor unions and a safety net for those people who simply can't take part in capitalism due to some sort of disability. And that's why we need democracy so people can vote for people who take care of those. But then again it's not the democracy that is flawed it's people who corrupt this system by taking money from companies and people to make laws in their favor and not in people's favor.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:22:30
Because they are right.


The lobbyists and corruption free democracy's laws

Man you're annoying. That's not what I am asking for and your answers are irrelevant to my question. Please let myself decide what is how risky and if it's better to not do it or do it. All I want is which possibilities are currently out there. And you're definitely not answering that.
Me:"I like to have a cheeseburger, where do I get it"
You:"Buy a salad, it's healthier for you"
Me:" Thanks for telling me, but I'm still looking for a cheeseburger. Where do I get one?"
You:" Cheeseburger are proven to make you sick in the long run, eat vegetables"
Me: "Thank you, but that wasn't the question"

Why is capitalism bad in itself?
In my opinion capitalism is the reason people like you and me are able to use the phones we use, communicate over the internet, have medicine, raised the average life expectation from 40 years to over 80, have jobs where we use our brains to improve things, have food in super markets, can become wealthy and retire before you die etc
Without capitalism we would still have monarchies, the privileged would be so because of their birth rights, the majority would have to to work for food on fields or hunt etc with no way out.
The only alternative system that could work is communism but that is just against human nature and has proven in history to not work.

I'm interested. Tell me more. The off chain parts are interesting to me bc an update, fork or who knows what happens could maybe kill a function somehow.
I'm just interested in locking down the value for exactly 10 years and see what happens. But I want to be sure I cannot access it but maybe proof ownership of the address.
I'm just looking to find a way to do this.

My self control is pretty fine, thanks for your concern and advice though. I have no issues with my money, shares and crypto in general. All I want is to use one of the potential functions Bitcoin offers that other assets don't have. It's an experiment. It's a hodl.
If I asked you what the best car is for grocery shopping don't tell me I could also walk there and do something for my health doing so. It's not what I asked. Thank you.

Could someone point me to where Voorhees hasnt stuck with Bitcoin?
I thought his point is crystall clear: the market decides what the best "bitcoin" or cryptocurrency is and the competition in the end is good for adoption and the winner is always rightfully the winner.
True libertarian.
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:07:28


I found my way to btc through some libertarian blogs and I can't believe this. I really can't. I followed Erik for a while and this sounds absolutly not like him. This would mean a 180 on all of his values and I can't believe that was the reason.
That being said - I didn't really follow he whole segwit, scaling drama. I've just let my btc sleep through this.
