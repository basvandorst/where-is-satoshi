I live in Australia. It’s literally the norm to call them torches here. Always has been.

Get one of those mechanisms they use in those torches (flashlight) you shake to charge. I mean sure it would probably fuck the hard drive but at least you’d have full batteries from shaking the case ��

Also +1 for 150 lashes!

As I understand it, wouldn’t it download block by block, in a relatively chronological order? 
So if you exported the database at a certain time, it would relieve the node from having to download the database from the start till the time stamp that the export was made? Therefore it would only need to download the blocks since the export?
Or am I understanding it wrong?
