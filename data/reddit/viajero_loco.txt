the whole point is that people don't trust them self to hold those bitcoins (and with good reason). 
nothing wrong with trusted (and insured) third parties, which hold your coins.
the day a regular bank starts a offering to hold your coins, you'll know that we've made a very big step towards mainstream acceptance!

I'm not posting this, to throw shit at finex. I have a very significant amount of BTC locked in there and therefore actually a vested interest in keeping them afloat.
I'm posting this, because finex has to realize that there are way more things to take care off than just their gaping security holes. The way they were running their exchange was absolutely unacceptable.
**THEY NEED TO FIX THIS!**
And they should take care of the most obvious issues _before_ they relaunch trading (if it ever happens, in any case).
If they can pull this off in a timely manner, pay out 64% now and the rest over time, they have a real shot at gaining trust again. At least in my opinion (and assuming they pay interest on the 36%).
But there is absolutely no room left, to fuck up and put the blame on their own customers _again_.
In short:
**Hire competent people, be super conservative (maybe deactivate margin trading until things run smoothly) and get your shit together!**

that would be relevant _only_ if there is no better solution than bankruptcy.
I'd rather they try to keep operating and make people whole over time, but socialize the losses between everyone who held any funds with them at the time of the hack /when their site went offline.
pretty much as described in my OP.

same data, sortet after stolen amount:
the hacker withdrew in that order as well (obviously starting with highest amount first):
2038.748721 BTC at 08:49:23 blockchain.info time
all addresses with more than 50 BTC got drained in the next 40 minutes. (before 09:29:06)
amounting to roughly 96,000 BTC
addresses with less than 50 BTC got drained in the next 2.5h with the last transaction probably occurring around 12:08:15, amounting to roughly 24,000 BTC
the tiniest amount stolen is 3.57604312 BTC and finex got to keep the "peanuts": accounts with less than that plus some big amounts, that probably weren't vulnerable to the attack.
The remaining 73.8k BTC:

those who still live in the US are without brain. In the US your assets can get taken away from you from any police officer without any reason at any time: 
whereas bitfinex can't be taken down by the US that easily. Besides, Bitfinex payed the fine and apparently complies with US regulation. so everything you said is pretty much bullshit.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:40:30
IMHO the _only_ fair thing to do is to weight _all_ assets against the loss. If you can't recover, proceed with bankruptcy. If it's less than say 30% proceed with haircut for _all_ users

@_date: 2016-08-06 00:43:17
Yes, but for BTC holders only (and for people who had active USD lending positions which where used to buy BTC).
That's why I consider it grossly unfair. 
Of course everyone who gets reimbursed fully with my and other BTC holders money feels different. So it will be up to the courts to decide what is "fair" and what's not.

yeah, no. You didn't follow anything I said. Devs bailing themselves out =| consensus.
But go ahead and keep fooling yourself.
In case you want to actually improve instead of staying ignorant, google 'consensus' and educate yourself.
75, even 85% is NOT consensus and ETH apparently forked with less than 70% ... That is suppression by the majority. Nothing else. That's what you're paying for right now.

the tl;dr of the video is how to make bitcoin QC secure.
at one point someone in the audience asks vitalik: "what would you do, if someone from the future would give you a QC?" vitalik is a bit puzzled by the question, thinks for a moment and then answers: "open source it"
in short, the video contradicts every single claim u/Bitcoin_Error_Log is making.

he is implying that since we all got forced to reset our 2fa 2 days ago and all these settings have to be activated at least 5 days in advanced, pretty much no one will be greenlined once withdrawals open.
since nobody is greenlined you guys manually and selectively approve almost all withdrawals without any third party oversight. concerns about abuse are very valid, don't you think?
you decide who gets their funds and who not. if shit hits the fan before everyone is out, it will be the latter who are fucked once again.
I have to admit, it's pretty fucked up!

it does include batching. It doesn't include cases like UTXO consolidation. (consolidating many inputs into one output).

can you explain, why you and [Elizabeth Stark]( consider it so reckless? Everyone who runs a lightning node knows that she risks losing the funds which is the reason all those active channels are only funded with fairly small amounts.
I'm about to fire up my own lightning node and want to hear a good argument why I shouldn't do it to make me reconsider.
The losing money argument doesn't count! I'm expecting to lose the funds in that experiment anyway.

look closer! unfortunately they are only pretending to fly. In reality still stuck to the ground... 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:37:52
I believe you can close the channel immediately by cooperating with your counterpart or unilaterally but with a predetermined waiting time.
If one side tries to cheat by unilaterally broadcasting an old channel state, the other side can punish the cheater by claiming all the channel funds.
LN is governed by a different set of game theoretical assumptions than Bitcoin. The idea is that cheating won't be much of an issue since cheaters are so easily exposed and severely punished.
I see one small problem though: many channels will always only move funds one way (i.e. your channel with your favorite coffee shop) once most or all of the funds belong to the coffee shop, you can attempt to close the channel unilaterally by broadcasting an old channel state without risking much or anything.
I don't know if this is already discussed somewhere?! It shouldn't be much of an issue though since it's fairly easy for the other party to implement countermeasures. It's probably one of the reasons though, why LN isn't recommended for large amounts. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:31:45
they sold fun coupons and scammed people into believing they are more than fun coupons. They did it in a pretty elaborate way though without actually ever saying they are anything but fun coupons. Their whitepaper accurately describes them as such. Got to give them credit for that!
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:18:42
There have been a lot of posts and tweets about Ethereum transacting more than all other coins combined. That was always obvious FUD but even more so considering that batching doesn't really makes sense with ETH while it is already used with scale on bitcoin. 
That's why this chart from bci is very misleading: 
One bitcoin transaction can represent a hundred, a thousand or even more single transactions. 
This happens all the time when a mining pool pays out thousands of independent miners or an exchange batches withdrawals.
Don't get fooled by people who try to sell the inefficiencies  of their network as a feature!

That's nonsense. It would only be a problem, if LN would replace bitcoin. It's not. It's build on top. So even if it turns out to be more centralized than bitcoin itself, it doesn't hurt since bitcoin keeps being decentralized.
But you would rather centralize bitcoin itself nonetheless just to make sure there is no service build on top that might (or might not) be more centralized?!

once you opened a channel (for example to your exchange) you can route all your LN transactions through this channel. 
Yes you need to fund the channel with a certain amount and you can't use those coins for anything else but LN transactions through this channel as long as it's open but I don't see why that is a big issue. LN isn't perfect but it certainly is a major step forward.
Once everyone can easily use LN, it should also free up a lot of blockspace...

that's how things go in theory. Reality is a different kind of beast. I assume you have never been robbed?! Things usually don't go your way, even if you own guns... it might protect you in some rare cases, I'm not arguing against that. The reality is, in most cases it doesn't help or just gets you killed....
p.s.: How do you know, there is a man behind a closed door about to rob you? how do you protect against one of the four taking your wife or baby hostage? why would they all just flee when you open fire? the usual response is opening fire as well! It's what you do, when you hold a gun and someone fires at you or your friends... you fire back!
Not sure how good you are at counting, but 4 guns definitely outnumber one gun! even one shotgun! Sometimes I get the impression that the worse people are at counting, the more guns they own and the more they think it protects them...

@_date: 2018-01-22 14:26:40
thanks to segwit, it is also possible to outsource the monitoring to a [trusted] third party for a small fee.
That's why LN involves a trusted third party in this specific setup. The main reason why r\btc tries to spinn it like it's a banking conspiracy. Unfortunately they completely ignore that you don't need to trust anyone by simply running your own lightning node which is fairly simple, cheap and straight forward.
Actually lightning solves the age old problem that you don't get any monetary reward for running a non mining fullnode: If you allow your node to route other peoples LN transactions, you can charge a small fee.
Very exciting times!

double that (segwit), double it again if coinbase &amp; co implement batching - that's 40 tps if we assume 10 right now. then 1000x or more with lightning. that's already far beyond paypal &amp; visa (combined). seems like we have a bit of wiggle room left!

@_date: 2019-07-14 17:06:41
well, the answer is obviously more nuanced. As always, it really depends! sure, you shouldn't use a wallet like BlueWallet to keep large amounts of coins there. But it's a very useful tool for day to day spending.
Then you have services like Casa which are basically offering a custodian service for larger amounts of coins and I would argue going with them is far saver than pretty much any cold storage even a highly technical person could set up.
I'd also argue, that very few people are able to keep their coins safe enough to justify not splitting them among say kraken.com bitstamp.net and bitcoin.de - they have a proven track record of keeping customer funds safe and if you fuck up, your coins are still there. Any tiny little fuckup in your own cold storage setup might very quickly lead to total loss of funds... Sure, some people might be up to the task. 99,9% of the worlds population certainly isn't!

Please enlighten me, if there is any way to hide the fee even better than how it is done right now without showing blatantly wrong balances.

I agree that it's stupid to blame a wallet for being custodial, especially when open source and coming with an option to use your own node and make it fully non-custodial.
People here have been brainwashed into thinking custodial is evil and this will cause a lot of people to lose their funds. There is a reason why nobody in their right mind considers stuffing large amounts of cash under your mattress a good idea! If you think storing bitcoins is easier and safer, I have bad news for you: 
That being said, BlueWallet only allows you to connect to an LND node. If you're running C-Lightning or eclair (which is arguably the best option) you are out of luck.

no, most reasonable people rather take 10 bucks tomorrow than 2 bucks today if they can choose. Every single hodler is a prime example of this!
Many miners are incredibly shortsighted. I'd go as far and call them dumb or even retarded! They have proven beyond any reasonable doubt (via switching back and forth to BCash) that they won't hesitate for a second to not only go for the 2 bucks today instead of the 10 bucks tomorrow, but also destroy the very thing that feeds them in order to get those 2 bucks.
Bitcoin only survived due to it's incredible resilience.
Those miners are the equivalent of dynamite using fishermen. bombing and destoying a reef that can feed generations indefinitely for one single catch really is beyond retarded!

thing is, core devs do care about those things. but they care about a safe and secure network even more. Thats why everything gets peer reviewed and tested again and again before it is deployed. Unfortunately this is not the fastest process but it has kept bitcoin running flawlessly without any hickups since many years. no other crypto currency has such a flawless track record. this is why bitcoin price is much higher than all the others combined!

no, my complain is about them refusing to implement the latest technology which could immediately solve the issues we're having with clogged up transactions and super high fees.
Implementing segwit would make the bitcoin network twice as efficient and effectively raise the blocksize from currently 1.1MB to possibly more than 2 MB
it very much looks like they only refuse to do this, in order to harm bitcoin and pump their publicly stated altcoin holdings.

bitcoin privat keys have 256 bits of entropy while public keys have 128 bits. If I'm not mistaken, there are some known attacks that might reduce the security of private keys down to 128 bits (in theory) so 12 words (128 bits) is roughly equivalent to bitcoins security and is more than enough. 
24 words (256 bits) might improve security a little as long as you never reuse an address or otherwise leak your public key since the mentioned attacks aren't as efficient in real life as they are in theory.
Pieter Wuille u/pwuille answered this question in more detail on bitcoin.stackexchange.com but I can't find the link at the moment.
In reality 12 is enough, 24 won't hurt (as long as you don't misspell or otherwise fuck up your backup). Considering the higher probability of error with 24 words, 12 are probably safer for most people...

sorry, posted this from my phone and somehow got disturbed by life and wasn't able to post the corresponding explainer and source.
not much time now either, just the short version:
Obviously bitcoin and BCash have the blockreward right now but once that goes low enough, fees will have to do the job. we might have a few years where we can rely on subsidy but the switch has to be gradually and therefore rather sooner than later. That's when BCash will have to introduce endless inflation or die...
here is the link to the paper:  
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:41:42


There are. The systems you are talking about are BCash, Ethereum and many more. They have spokes persons, they have (benevolent) dictators and centralized development. They have giant marketing budgets and questionable tech.
Bitcoin is the diametral opposite of that and so far people are holding it in high regard exactly for that reason. That doesn't mean that people won't try to subvert it but due to the way the system is build, all they can achieve is to create another fork. Another shitcoin like thousands before.
As long as the market values bitcoin precisely for it's ungovernability, it's resilience to regulation, it's censorship resistance and decentralization, things probably won't change all that much!
This is why I think bitcoins price is an important property. It doesn't matter if it temporarily drops to 1000$ or even less. Long-term integrity of the system is more important than short term returns.
But when developers say, they don't care if it drops to 5$ I do get a bit worried. It would most likely mean that the market made up its mind and Bitcoin would probably stay an insignificant niche product that might make some hardcore libertarians and anarcho capitalists happy, but it would also have failed to have any meaningful impact on society...

Thanks to those two companies refusing to adopt segwit, the network gets more and more congested, costing each and everyone of us insane fees!
blockchain,info is said to be responsible for the vast majority of bitcoin transactions. Coinbase and BitPay should be a close second and third. 
All of them tried to force SegWit2x down our throats without ever caring what the community and the market really wanted. They said blocksize and transaction fees are the biggest concern bitcoin has right now.
Apparently it was all just lies to gain more power. If it really was a concern for them, why are they refusing to implement segwit? those 4 companies alone could probably free up 30-60% of blockspace and raise the blocksize above 1.5MB but it seems they want to hurt bitcoin as much as possible, just to pump other altcoins like ethereum.
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of coinbase publicly stated that he owns more ETH than BTC 
 **This is probably the main reason, why he's actively harming bitcoin!**

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:52


the point is, that the network would probably not be congested if segwit was widely used and fees would therefore go down to cents, (&lt;20 sat/b). Doubling the blocksize (with segwit) doesn't mean halving of the fees. That's not how bitcoin works. If capacity is bigger than demand, fees are close to zero.
Obviously miners can spam the network at basically no cost and force everyone to overpay. This problem will not go away unfortunately as long as the blockreward dwarfs the transaction fees.
Unfortunately nobody ever expected the miners to be so insanely shortsighted and hostile towards bitcoin. It seems like the vast majority of them are only interested in turning a quick buck today and give zero fucks about tomorrow. Pretty crazy that bitcoin still works flawlessly (besides high fees) in those adversarial conditions actually!

I guess you haven't been around the last 2 years?! Brian doesn't understand Bitcoin! Classic would've split the network or rather created a shitcoin like BCash, same with Unlimited and SegWit2x. Brian supported all of them due to his lack of understanding.
He's been proven wrong again and again! The developers of bitcoin can't change the rules or decide about a hardfork. Only the users can. The users have spoken. They prefer high fees and a conservative approach over reckless changes and bigger blocks. it is what it is, weather you like it or not. Unfortunately Brian Armstrong will never get it....

One day Stephen Pair (BitPay CEO) writes a piece on medium (now apparently deleted) where he tells everyone how core is doing a great job and bitcoin is working "flawlessly" then, the next day he takes a couple of millions from Jihan and he goes on about how broken bitcoin is and supports a hardfork to get rid of the core developers which also gives all the power to the miners (i.e. Jihan, who just gave him a couple of millions...)

I have to admit my knowledge about Ethereum is quite limited but when knowledgeable people like BitGo  on twitter complain about having a very hard time to keep their ethereum nodes synced and up and running (that was months ago, before CryptoKitties) it kind of makes me weary...
I also have a hard time believing that it wouldn't make a difference if there were no archival nodes anymore. Why do they exist in the first place?
All in all it doesn't sound very rubust and I wouldn't feel comfortable storing significant wealth in such a shaky system.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:22:41
that would be a very dangerous thing to to. i really don't get why is pulling this discussion on to a puplic stage, instead of keeping it on a technical level, where it belongs?!
why, for example, are 's and others concerns not being addressed?


I would be much much more gung-ho about increases to block size if they were modest and not being proposed against super-massive consolidation in node operations and mining that we've seen since 2011; and if they were accompanied by the controls that would avoid completely undermining the long term security model of Bitcoin.
I mean, pretty much all the other developers besides mike are opposed to his proposal.
and now gavin is using the torch and pitchfork crowd to back him up. that strategy is fucking ridiculous and might very well be the end to bitcoin in the long run!

no one from the BU camp has ever addressed the very serious concerns raised by aron and literally hundreds of the most reputable individuals of the community.
no amount of silly analogies can change the fact, that segwit has already more than [66% community support]( and rising by the minute while BU is stuck at [less than 8%]( since ages. 
at one point you just have to face the inconvenient truth, that more than 90% of bitcoin users can see through your bullshit.
you might be able to convince miners to give all the power to them self and (if they are stupid enough) to fork them self off the network, but I highly doubt even that.
bottom line: all you'll be able to achieve is block progress a bit longer and completely and utterly destroy the reputation of everybody who is stupid enough to support the cluster fuck that BU is.

Same is true for OKPay since last week, btw. Just suspended operations in Germany as well.
The BaFin is very effective at protecting the banks... huuuups, sorry! I obviously meant to say the people...
I'm honestly baffled that LBC hasn't experienced more headwind in other countries like it did in Germany. My guess is, things will change very quickly once it reaches a certain significance! For now it's probably just way to small for most regulators to give a shit...

Unlike all the other "&lt;random country&gt; is going full bitcoin" nonsense posts which get upvoted like no tomorrow, this paper is backed up by real data and actual facts.
Very good read and, I never thought I'd ever use those words: very bullish for bitcoin! ;)

Your quote is a perfect example of the naivete of the author, BU developers and BU supporters in general.
Bitcoin was invented to replace the cumbersome, slow and costly human "consensus" in banking and finance with a predictable and more efficient machine consensus. The so called nakamoto consensus, a solution to the [Byzantines Generals Problem](
Now BU comes around and changes this single most significant breakthrough in bitcoin and goes back to a manually adjustable human "consensus" with all it's know downsides.
This makes no sense whatsoever. It would be smarter to just stop using bitcoin all together.

@_date: 2017-02-19 15:24:06
how does the ability to send RBF transactions change anything for non RBF transactions? your statement makes no sense.
a vendor can see right away if the transaction he receives is RBF enabled and therefore _needs_ at least one or two confirmations or if it's a non RBF transaction and therefore can be handled as before.
the reason the acceptance of zero conf. has dropped is just because people are starting to realize the risk. it has nothing to do with optional RBF.
If I'm not completely wrong, you have to enable RBF _before_ you broadcast your transaction. if you didn't, you cant replace it by fee and therefore nothing has changed for "the real world risk and threat of double-spends for businesses and users"
edit: gregs comment further down already confirms that what I'm describing is correct.

cash settles transactions by definition. what you want is a payment network. maybe try paypal?
bitcoin cannot and was never meant to be a payment network.
with segwit it could be build on top of bitcoin though.
win win!

the whole idea of bitcoin was a system where you don't have to trust anyone because you can VERIFY everything yourself.
maybe try to get your facts straight.
The moment we have to trust the miners, bitcoin has failed.

@_date: 2017-02-16 11:20:11
That's all good and well but doesn't have any relevance in a scenario where 1 or 2 pool operators control 20-40% of haspower and use that power against the rest of the users.
In that case bitcoin is already under attack/broken due to mining centralization and what I described above is a defense strategy against that attack.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:19:08
why would they run core and not BU or core older than 0.13., if they don't support core and segwit?

its actually [more than 66%]( already.
@_date: 2017-02-13 16:37:49
support is at over 64% of all full nodes right now and rising fast:
if 80-90% of nodes support segwit, we should expect the miners to fall in line. if not, we have to remind them of their duty. if they still don't cooperate, we might need to fire them via a PoW hard fork.

i just decided to open my eyes and accept, that we are in a long-term down trend where it is a good idea, to sell some coins, after a significant rise and buy them back after a significant dump. thats all.

@_date: 2017-02-28 05:20:34
sorry to break it to you but there is no such thing as intrinsic value. It's one of the most common and widely repeated misconceptions.
fertile soil and clean fresh water are arguably the single most (intrinsically) valuable resources we have on the planet. if there were such a thing as intrinsic value those two would be worth millions per gram.
truth is, there is no intrinsic value hence both are essentially free.
what you confuse for intrinsic value is the same thing that makes anything of value valuable: the fact that other people are willing to pay for it (in almost all cases it's just plain old scarcity). crude oil has huge "intrinsic value" because it's somewhat scarce and the world economy depends on it. the moment the economy switches to other means of energy supply, people will realize that the "intrinsic value" of oil was actually just the fact, that others were willing to pay for it and its presumed scarcity.
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:16:30
The whole idea of that proposal is to make look BU less laughable (it only accounts for 4-7% node count).
Since Olivier is putting a decent ammount of money on the line, we can expect an uptick of BU nodes.
Even though this will not be successfully in any way, it's still a Sybil attack and it's good to know that even if the node count goes up, BU doesn't actually gained more popularity.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:25:24
are you sure about that? ;) fortunately bitstamp was running for more than 6 months... but I'm not so sure about my assessment anymore:

good find! so to me it looks more and more like the rumor is correct! nobody would pay 1 BTC fee, besides a hacker who wants to get out the coins as fast as possible!
**AND: as mentioned elsewhere, the transactions to this walled are lining up perfectly with the timespan of the supposed hack!**
so we have two strong leads who are supporting the theorie, that this walled belongs to the bitstamp hacker and nothing so far that would debunk it!
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:01:44
bitstamp orderbook still empty (only 2 fantasy orders) - BTC withdrawal got propagated immediately. first one got 1 confirmation, second one, waiting to be confirmed
**edit:** second one (not so small) got confirmed. bitstamp hotwallet untouched?! :-o

what do you prefere? being honest and telling you, that he is trading on his exchange or lying to you? 
it is very interesting, listen to him, speaking very open and (perceived) honestly about trading and the exchange business.
be sure, that there is lots of insider trading going on on every exchange. 
after listening to him a lot, i would give him the benefit of doubt, that he is trading on his exchange, because he likes it the most and not to fuck his customers over!
nobody can seperate his knowledge from his decisions but again, what exchange do you prefere? the one which is open about it or the one which doing shady things in the dark?

@_date: 2017-02-14 13:59:52
That's right. The cost is roughly the block reward + tx fees divided by number of transactions per block.
I.e.: (12.5 + 0.5) x 1,000USD / 2,500 = 5.20USD
so 5.2$ is roughly the true cost of a bitcoin transaction
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:03:48
even though many reputable people were quick to point out that his conclusion has it completely backwards and likely the opposite is true, it still stands uncorrected and gets cited on a regular basis to backup similar (questionable) claims.

so even if this turnes out to be true, i guess we can still expect to be reimbursed. 
bitstamp charges between 0.4 and 1% in fees per trade. if we assume an average of 0.7 they earned around 14,000 coins in the last 6 months.

@_date: 2015-01-29 18:55:37
i want to buy a trezor, but to my laymens ears this sounds as if you aren't taken this issue seriously.
i don't think it is a very good idea, to walk around with a trezor with 100 thousands $ worth of coins on it but still, even the theoretical possibility of a remote attack is somewhat worrying.
and concerning the new license: you are only scaring away the ones who are willing to pay the premium for the real deal. the ones who only care about the price will buy the copy cat no matter what...
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:17:25
there are as many retards there as there are here! it's just the other extreme. but by going there once in a little while you can keep the balance and reconnect to reality. if you never leave you are lost in moontalk...
i increased my bitcoin holdings significantly, after i stoped listening to the moontalkers and became a midterm bear
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:08:30
so we are on the same page here... since bitcoin works just fine  a coin, who is to say, that 200 is cheap? I'm happy to see the price rise again, but there is at least a 50% chance, that we see much lower prices first.
that part we should have learned from the many, many false bottoms, that got called so far!
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:20:11
holy crap. whatever... i'm tired of explaing all the obvious facts twice... read my other posts.
in the mean time just keep downvoting and wait until it gets confirmed from stamp...
just wanted to provide you with the "breaking news". granted 100% based on rumors, but those rumors seem to be somewhat foundet by evidence...
i mean, we are talking about 14% of their coins lost! if this turns out top be true, prepare for a haircut. i'm just happy, that i made a little more than 13% profit yesterday with my bitstamp coins by selling and rebuying..

5 is easily enforceable. anyone doing business and accepting BTC goes to jail. problem solved.
cross-border capital transfer with bitcoin is harder to control. but if they closely monitor every single available fiat onramp and know who owns how many bitcoins, people will have a hard time hiding their wealth. so don't get your bitcoins stolen in china or authorities might put you in jail for suspected capital flight!
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:43:57
yes. as it says in my top comment. users of bitcoin.de and readers of the blog should roughly be the same regardless...
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:06:18
yep. happens when you are allergic against peer review. as far as I know core developers like u/nullc even helped to fix some of the most serious issues in BU(!!!)
besides, BU has lot's of extremely unprofessional and insulting references in their code. maybe someone can link the source to that.
I wouldn't go anywhere near a development team that acts like immature teenagers.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:33:34
the best answer to your bullshit claim without source is the title of this post:
"I'm amazed how frequently and thoughtfully some core devs respond, despite having to wade through ad hominem attacks"
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:30:43
you have no idea what it will do to the price if they pull out. they haven't yet, but they very well might. that risk alone is enough to make any smart investor sell soon if they haven't already. I would be very, very surprised if price can hold above 800. I'd expect 560 or 470 at the very least, if jihan and roger keep fighting.
for now, at least, it sounds like both will:
miners can mine profitable at 337$ when we assume 10c electricity costs. [source](
at 5 cents they turn a buck as long as price is above 100$
we have to assume that chinese miners have almost 0 electricity costs and can mine at a loss anyway since bitcoin can circumvent capital controls.
I think, jihan playing it to the very end is a very real possibility. that means we might test very old support in the 150-250$ range.  If he wins, which is also entirely possible, real bitcoin will be dead and the price will be 0 - no clue what price a future jihan coin will have. 
I don't really think he will win. just pointing out that it is a possibility and what the uncertainty will do to the price.

[resubmitted again, with a less stupid title]
background: up until now BU claimed that in case of a BU fork with 75% hashpower threshold, the minority chain would die instantly or at least in a very short time, making any considerations of two chains moot. It seems like BU is finally realizing that this argument can not hold up and the minority chain will prevail or even take over BU.
but lets see and have a look at what Gavin and Bitcoin Unlimited's [official]( autocratic [judge, jury and executioner]( Andrew Stone (u/thezerg1) have to say:
u/gavinandresen on the issue that the BU fork is going to destroy itself the moment the old chain catches up:


are you fucking serious, Gavin? So users have to change consensus rules based on a whim, to somehow activate a completely uncoordinated hardfork? sure! fool prove idea!


Nice definition you have there. Changing it twice a day is the very essence of a good definition. Makes it more of a living and breathing organism. So much better than the dead and dusty old concept of definitions.


yeah?! more fuzzy concepts we need! hoooray!


The Nakamoto Consensus is such a tyrannical concept! we need to free our self from this consensus tyranny! **One chain per user** is the future! embrace the freedom!


… IF you choose to post in a highly public forum like twitter, you will receive a highly public answer. BUT you could instead choose to explore these important engineering questions privately or semi-privately with the BU team so we can actually help Coinbase come up with a strategy in a “safe space”.
ahh, so because BU regularly proposes nonsense that gets ripped to shreds if discussed publicly, literally hiding in a "save space" is the solution! totally agree! way to go!


well, sorry to break it to you, but you guys called yourself Bitcoin Unlimited already! now you want everyone else to stop calling Bitcoin Bitcoin and instead call BU Bitcoin and Bitcoin Bitcoin old?!
yep sure! totally and 100% going to happen! no doubt about it!


sure, we even have abbreviations already:
BTC (Bitcoin, the one that doesn't break consensus)
LBB (Lage block Bitcoin) or
BUTs (Bitcoin Unlimited Tokens) or
BTU (Bitcoin Unlimited)
I personally think BUTs is the way to go! Has such a nice zing to it!


you got it. that is exactly what is going to happen and Charlie already confirmed it: "[There is absolutely no way I would let GDAX make the reckless decision of supporting BU code as is.](
**tl;dr**: 
exchanges will just stick with BTC, let users withdraw their BUTs so they can dump them if they manage to find a dumping spot.
that's all for the moment! thank you, over and out!

hashrate follows price, not the other way round. ethereum proved that for us.
there are some mutual dependencies but ultimately it's the users who decide which coin and which rules they value.the miners have to follow suit. they only have a say due to the fact that they are users as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:32:24


No, we don't. You just have absolutely no idea how bitcoin works. Period.
Transactions that get included into the blockchain and have to be carried around and relayed by every single participant no matter what are the issue.
Unconfirmed transactions _do not matter._ nobody _has_ to care about them, they don't threaten the network.
Let's agree to disagree. This is just a waste of my time. You clearly refuse to educate yourself. It's your human right to stay ignorant, I guess.

since there has never been anything like bitcoin before bitcoin, any analogy is fundamentally flawed, once you look at technical details.
they can still highlight and maybe even help better understand non technical aspects.
VOIP is an innovation that works via the same century old copper lines that used to be used by telegraphs. It's arguably preferable over just building more or "bigger" telegraph connections.
segwit makes 2nd layers on top of bitcoin much more feasible, without building much more or bigger highway lanes, pushing literally all the costs onto nodes. (sorry, another shitty analogy) ;)
I agree, "pretty good analogy" is maybe a pretty good exaggeration... I just posted it without thinking too much about it.
I disagree that this has anything to do with why we have rbtc though. I think your reasoning is way off actually...
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:31:28
this! u/seweso, one of the most if not the single most active user over there [publicly claimed]( that he sold all his BTC for ETH. still he spends ALL his time pushing for BU! One wonders why! /s
this seems to be true for the vast majority in that subreddit. 
Roger Ver is shilling shitcoins like the more or less confirmed scam dash since ages.
I think it's safe to say that a very significant, if not the majority part of the BU crowd wants to harm bitcoin.
the best example is buttcoiner u/jstolfi, who is a proclaimed enemy of bitcoin and is upvoted in r\btc like no one else on a regular basis.

OK, you make some valid points. I'm curious though, if you fully understand the implications of your decision? Have you read at least those two articles:
Here is my take on the matter, copy pasted from an earlier post here on reddit:
It is correct that BU doesn't change anything that couldn't have been changed before.


The big issue here is that Bitcoin was invented to replace the cumbersome, slow and costly human or user consensus in banking and finance with a predictable and more efficient machine consensus. The so called nakamoto consensus, a solution to the [Byzantines Generals Problem](


Now BU comes around and changes this single most significant breakthrough in bitcoin and goes back to a manually adjustable human "consensus" with all it's know downsides and with the need of a trusted third party (the miners).
This makes no sense whatsoever. It would be smarter to just stop using bitcoin all together.
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:20:17


Supporting segwit |= already implemented segwit. Sorry I thought that's obvious. Apparently not for you...


Citation needed.


21.co only counts listening nodes. I'd expect someone who has a strong opinion on bitcoin would know that. Obviously I was wrong again.


Ok, I was wrong. Another time. It's actually two people with serious ego problems: jihan and roger.
Point for you.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:28:29
well, for starters Ethereum is absolutely indistinguishable from any other random ICO scam. They raised millions and millions of dollars to pay them self without delivering anything useful so far.  Maybe it will be useful one day, maybe not.
Then he publicly bragged about buying shitloads of DAO tokens when the price started reflecting the risk involved and fell below the "guaranteed" swap-back rate.
After the whole thing blew up, he rolled back the blockchain, basically performing a giant 51% attack against the DAO "hacker" to bail his friends and himself out.
most recently he called soft-forks, which are by definition backwards compatible, coercive just to create more drama in the Bitcoin scaling debate in order to profit from rising ETH prices.
The list goes on. That's just the few things I remembered without digging through old posts and other data.
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:40:05
some examples, like this:


A 2mb fork from core itself would be by far the best option for bitcoin.
Once it's clear the classic fork will happen and the core devs are not announcing a 2mb fork i really have to wonder who they develop for.
or this:




When Mike Hearn included a switch in XT that would enable him to unilaterally kick any arbitrary node off the network for any reason, that should have resulted in the "community" realizing several things:








Decisions have consequences. "the community" currently banging on for a blocksize increase without understanding the long-range security implications, has proven themselves devoid of sound judgement, or of being worth listening to by those who aren't.
or this: 


But that said, I would also prefer to have everyone united again, a hard fork civil war could throw us back a lot. Also I don't trust the Bitcoin Classic guys, to me it seems to be mainly a marketing stunt without actually having capable developers required for such a project.

everyone wants segwit: 
power hungry miners are blocking it and need to be pushed back in line.
If there were consensus for a block size increase hard fork to 2MB it would probably be fine. Problem is, we don't have consensus. So it will not and can not happen.

5. **Replacing fiat by using bitcoin to purchase goods.**

why would we change the PoW just because BU created a shitcoin? all we have to do, is to wait a few hours, maybe days until BU has annihilated itself.
We only have to change PoW if miners decide to attack the original chain. I doubt that they'd do that. The risk is too big that they render all their ASICs useless and thereby destroy millions and millions of their own dollars.

Sorry but bitcoin couldn't care less about their feelings. Nobody has control over bitcoin and nobody ever had. That's part of the design.
If that makes some people feel something is taken away from them, they just prove a fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin. They can stomp their feet and grind their teeth all they want. Nothing will change.
The earlier they leave and move over to ethereum the better. There they can have their much hailed central authority which they can appeal to.

your claims have been refuted so many times already. I'm sure, u/nullc has a few useful links handy.
the claim that it's risky as a soft work is really disingenuous, for example, considering the much, much, MUCH greater risk of a hard fork.
the claim "adds technical debt" is just an endlessly repeated lie! The truth is, that it significantly reduces technical debt: 
"too much stuff at once" is also very disingenuous, considering the incredible amount of testing, that went into segwit. and especially since it's completely opt-in not on one, but on 3(!!!) levels!
what better scailing options are available? scaling always comes at a risk and is a trade off. don't tell me, BU is in anyway superior!

Users effectively want a impressive, elegant bridge that spans 100km, can handle unlimited cars at any given time, lasts until forever and is completely free to use.
The engineers (developers) are the ones who know what's possible and what's not. They can build the bridge but if it's supposed to last it has to meet certain safety measures and it costs money.
Sure, it can be "free" if it is subsidized via tax (block reward) AND therefore 100% controlled by an entity like the nation state (miners) for ever but is this really the bridge (bitcoin) you want?

not everything is what it appears to be.
understanding decentralized governance, open source software development and the incentive system of bitcoin requires tremendous amounts of time consuming research. me and most other people who can not code and do not understand cryptography on a deep enough level have no hope of ever grasping it fully.
all we can do is trust the experts and double and tripple check their reasoning. are they arguing consistently? are their decisions based on science and peer review? etc, ppp.....
everyone who is allergic to peer review and scientific scrutiny should be questioned and taken at face value.
if you haven't literally spend years doing research, you should probably be very careful judging anything bitcoin related. and even if you have, you probably don't really have a clue, if you haven't contributed significantly to the code base.
we should all listen more to the ones who have!
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:33:09
You are right. BU would be better described as an altcoin (aka shitcoin).
created through a hardfork though. no amount of lies you are spreading here can make these facts go away.
what you are saying is basically the same as saying segwit is not a softfork (as long as it doesn't activate).
not surprised to see such bullshit coming directly from the BU team! 
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:46:20
there is no doubt shitcoins can go up in value tenfold and more.
the question is, does your shitcoin still exist in 1,2 or 3 years from now and how much is it worth compared to BTC.
truth is, every single shitcoin ever created already went or is on the way down the drain.
there might be 2 or 3 exceptions. good luck, picking the right one though.

@_date: 2017-03-13 17:05:28
bitcoin has what is called pseudo anonymity. every transaction is publicly recorded but no real world identities are attached to those transactions.
the level of real anonymity can be quite high, if you follow certain best practices like avoiding address reuse. 
If you post your bitcoin address online connected to your real identity, though and keep all your coins in that address, all your future transactions can be linked back to you and you gave up all your privacy.
in short, privacy in bitcoin is a complicated matter and desperately needs significant improvements which could be accomplished after the groundwork is laid down with segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:36:52

the only thing they could do, to make it better is to clearly state that the expiry date will be extended another 6 months or whatever if BU isn't clearly dead by the end of the year.
But no clear expiry is problematic as well... besides, if BU hasn't forked by the end of the year I'd say it's safe to assume it won't ever!

maybe he is happy with the tens of millions if not hundreds he already made and sold his coins for ETH.
Besides, he probably likes to be the sole owner of Bitcoin (unlimited) and is confident to be able to kill core.
since they control bitcoin.com, btc.com and every nation state around the globe is most likely happy to support a bitcoin they can regulate via one single person, I honestly think his battle plan should be taken very, very serious!

111 identical nodes at exact same location doesn't sound like a smart way to run nodes as a bitcoin business. Makes more sense to run them at different places to be protected against as many failure modes possible.

thanks for spreading lies and distorted facts! every full node will follow the longest **valid** chain! no matter how much bullshit you post on reddit.
If a miner doesn't follow the rules his blocks will be rejected and his and every other node who propagates them will be banned.

I agree with you. And I generally dislike conspiracy theories myself. But it becomes more and more difficult to not at least consider some possibilities.
I don't think china is far behind the capabilities of NSA and CIA and they just [proved pretty impressively]( what they are capable and willing to do.
Anyone with half a brain realizes the serious threats bitcoin poses to governments worldwide. Especially with better fungibility enabled by segwit.
Governments might be slow in general. Intelligence agencies can react quite quickly though!
There is only a small time window open to significantly influence bitcoin without banning it outright. That window is open now and not that much longer anymore.
I don't think it is unreasonable to assume certain nation state actors came to the same conclusion and are acting on their own behalf as we speak.

OK, 0-fee was obviously not the best example. use a fee a little bit above the default of 0.01 mBTC/KB minrelaytxfee in core.
same story. all you will accomplish is flooding the mempool. who cares? since when are tons of low fee tx that have no chance of ever confirming a problem? there are literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of those.
doesn't hurt bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:08:06
how does it matter much as long as it isn't confirmed? the network doesn't care much about low fee transactions. you can broadcast millions literally for free, if you want! if that would be an issue for the network, it would be broken anyway!

I don't understand what you are trying to say. I have a feeling you completely misread my posts. I edited the parent post and added a quote from you, to make it more clear, what I'm talking about.
of course the dealers are important. that's my whole point! and i don't see them having any serious issues: 
all I see is people wo apparently never use bitcoin whining about fees.
the ones who really use it seem to be quite happy with the rising price!
my question again:


@_date: 2017-03-14 15:31:07


@_date: 2017-03-15 11:55:56
since bitcoin is developed completely decentralized by more than 100 independent developers around the globe I can only assume that you are talking about centralized mining and the recent control grabbing attempts  by miners and BU (Bitcoin Unsafe).
so yeah, I totally agree that we have to break free from this centralization attack.
glad we found some common ground!

fire him or jail him! seriously! 
I think we might have found the core of your misunderstanding!
Imagine a banks senior security contractor goes rogue, demands more power and a say in management decisions. 
Do you really think that would win him anything than being replaced in no time? Which Bank would accept that? Sure he can make suggestions regarding security! nothing more, nothing less. He **WILL. NOT.** be the one making the decisions! 
Miners are exactly that: the security guards of the network with not much more say than any other random user!
In fact, bitcoins network design was based on the assumption that every user is a miner. (one CPU, one vote) unfortunately we can't mine with CPUs anymore
I realize that this sounds pretty paternalistic:


That wasn't my intention. I feel a bit stupid having written that. I know I have many knowledge gaps when it comes to understanding bitcoin. especially regarding the details. And I sure as hell have no idea about the code or cryptography.
What I think I do understand quite accurately though, are the basic assumptions, holding the system together. 
Especially the important properties, that can not, under no circumstances whatsoever, be compromised.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:59:08


how does that matter, since hard forks without network split are per definition impossible without almost 100% consensus.


no, it states pretty clearly **"BU whith EC, without segwit = 3%"**. Thats what BU is. They said again and again that they do not and will not support segwit!
why are you doing this? Distorting facts again and again?!

B. receives 1 million donation

you are right, I'm putting some of the puzzle pieces together myself. doesn't mean I've put them on the wrong place.

that's what I'm trying to explain to you since I don't know how many posts.
LN saves a ton of on-chain tx, no matter if p2p or with third party. obviously with third parties it can save orders of magnitudes more than p2p. but p2p can save orders of magnitudes versus conventional tx's already.

Just saw that all the BU claims have been refuted hours ago on twitter already: 
hilarious read!
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:42:24
no. 1.1MB blocks would be rejected by everyone. only BU would accept them if they ever reach 75% hashpower which seems very unlikely. and even if they do, they will just hardfork and create an altcoin, commonly refered to as BTU or BUTs (BitcoinUnlimitedTokens).
charli is talking about a hypothetical UASF and a malicious miner initiated fork which would still be core (1MB max) but violate the new segwit rules on the UASF.

that's either you being uninformed or one of the many r\btc lies. have you ever followed the bitcoin_dev mailing list or the bitcoin-dev IRC channels? the logs are public: 


nope, his commit access was revoked because he stopped committing and and hasen't been for quite a while before people were worried he got compromised after he publicly proclaimed Wright is Satoshi.
He himself revoked commit access of at least one other developer for the same reason: infrequent commits.
Greg Maxwell gave up his commit access as well, btw!


are you talking bout this? 
 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:42:20
I thought it is obvious to everyone, but apparently it isn't:
of course these tweets are not based on facts. It is an intellectual game. The purpose is to show how a smart, almost undetectable social attack on bitcoin might be executed.
There is huge amounts of evidence that people use this strategy right now to discredit bitcoin and pump altcoins. Roger Ver and the single most active r\btc user u/seweso are the best examples. Seweso [publicly announced]( the sale of all his BTC for ETH 8 months ago and is pushing hard for Bitcoin unlimited ever since. Spending many hours every day spreading lies about core and segwit on reddit, twitter and co. u/jstolfi is another proclaimed enemy of bitcoin who uses the tactic outlined in the tweets, to [damage bitcoin]( Very actively pushing for any consensus breaking proposal as well.
In short, we have unrefutable evidence for this attack being executed in a somewhat uncoordinated way. We have lots of puzzle pieces which indicate a more coordinated execution by actors like Roger and Jihan. 
It is entirely possible, that this kind of attack is also pursued by much more powerful actors right now or might very well be in the future.
I didn't post this, to feed conspiracy theories though! I posted this, to raise awareness. 
THIS is how Bitcoin will be attacked! NOT by nation states buying vast amounts of hashpower!
 
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:42:03
you don't know how BU works. Any node will accept any block size if miners mine enough of them. that's what the AD value determines.
the number of blocks needed before literally any size is accepted.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:29:32


how so? you only need 6-10% hashpower to block segwit. it's completely free as well, since you get to keep the block reward.

can't blame him for doing his part. Can only blame other companies for doing nothing. I sure hope all the big players will be involved in due time and centralization will be less of an issue.
btw, you apparently didn't find the important thing. what he is actually building:
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:34:55
As I said, I know it is unpopular but finish reading this comment and Vinnys medium posts. Try to understand his reasoning! He is absolutely right with what he is saying. Don't make this place an even worse echo chamber by just blindly down voting!
**Explanation**: If you hold your coins, you effectively pay the miners, via the block reward for whatever they are doing right now. (the block reward is an inflation "tax" on your holdings).
This means (indirectly) you pay them to fork to BU.
You stop paying them, the moment you sell. This will send a signal to them that we don't approve of their actions.
**IMPORTANT side note:** Vinny is the only one who was consistently correct with his (price)predictions ever since 2012!
I understand that no hodler ever want's to sell. It's a very painful act. I bought my coins in 2012 and I never sold before. After being hesitant for way to long I only managed to sell 30% so far, but considering that this is the **only** way we can make our self be heard I see no other option but to sell more.
Here is a better explanation of Vinny's reasoning by himself: 
and another very important and informative read:
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:14:03
F2Pool is a real pool, Bitmoin produces roughly 70% of the ASICs that power the entire Bitcoin network.
It's a pretty hard to believe assumption that their pool just consists of random independent miners! AFAIK they never refuted the claim that they control all the hash power them self.

I was seriously hoping I could help clear up your misunderstandings. But it seems you can't or won't manage to wrap your head around it.


No, work is nothing more than a tool to secure the network and prevent double spends.
The magic of bitcoin is the Nakamoto Consensus and the fact that Satoshi was able to create a incentive system that balances all the different but necessary parts that make Bitcoin a whole. It is a way more fragile system than many people realize and it only works thanks to the hard working developers keeping the sometimes opposing   powers in balance.
You seem to have fallen for some kind of miner or PoW fetish. Unfortunately this is a very widespread misconception :(

Other notable quotes:






Ironically these tweets are answers to Andreas Antonopoulos misconception that a bigger block size can avoid congestion and unpredictable confirmation times.
I'd assume u/jgarzik did a great job to help Andreas better understand the issue. Andreas seems to have taken this new information to heart and changed his mind. Whereas Jeff forgot everything he knew back then and is now pushing in the opposite direction.
I really miss the old Jeff Garzik. I hope he comes back one day. I kind of doubt it though, since his company recently [bought the blockchain surveillance firm Skry](
Layer two is bad for his business now, since it will make it harder to spy on bitcoiners.

you are confused. luke is arguing for a blocksize decrease since the beginning of time. he never wanted to raise it in the near future.
and, surprise! he just published a BIP that does exactly that: decreasing the block size now and increasing it in the distant future.
I'd call that consistent! 
same goes for u/theymos.
he is an idiot for destroying some of his reputation via the multi million dollar bitcointalk forum software project, but he has always argued consistently. 
and he has proven to understand bitcoin better than you, me and 99% of r\btc and r\bitcoin users combined.

Yeah, I agree. My take on it is pretty hostile and "toxic"
Do you want to know the reason for that?
The lies and misinformation being spread here by people like Bergmann are extremely tiring! 
Why is he writing articles praising BU when it is abundantly clear, that it is a paid campaign to take away the power from the users and give it to 2-3 people in china and possible the PBoC?
His own readers tell him that they don't want any of that nonsense and he's still refusing to accept that and keeps pushing for a contentious hard fork. Essentially threatening to destroy Bitcoin!
Thomas Zander just made it absolutely clear, what BU is all about! (Spoiler: it has nothing to do with block size increase!):
I will stop attacking u/CBergmann as soon as he admits, that he has been wrong/bamboozled by BU and starts speaking up against it! 
I fear that might never happen though. He doesn't seem to have the integrity!

have you heard of tumble bit? mimblewimble? schnorr signatures? coin join? local bitcoins? bitcoin ATMs? 


the digital gold/store of value use case actually benefits from less illegal activity. I think you haven't really thought your reasoning through.

**edit:** I feel like I owe an explainer, why I'm so hostile and "toxic":
**edit2:** As Bergman pointed out, It's not a survey directly from bitcoin.de, but from bitcoinblog. I honestly assumed it's directly from bitcoin.de since you end up on bitcoinblog when you click "NEWS" on bitcoin.de - I think it's fair to assume that users of bitcoin.de and readers of bitcoinblog are more or less the same, since both websites are very closely interconnected.
Time and time again reality reminds me that kind and friendly interaction gets you way farther than assuming bad faith and showing hostility: 
Unfortunately it seems to me, that there are quite a few bad actors. Probably paid to divide the community and push us into this kind of hostility. I'll try to not let myself get sucked into it so easily again...
Unfortunately the author and self proclaimed BU-fanboy (his very own words, not making this shit up) u/CBergmann messed things up real good. Everybody could vote for everything. The data is therefore pretty much useless. Only two things are abundantly clear: absolutely nobody wants BU and everyone likes segwit.
The vast majority voted for 1 or 2MB block size + segwit.
I find it rather fascinating that u/CBergmann, after expressing his surprise in the article about the results of the poll, keeps shilling for BU on reddit at this very moment as if nothing ever happened.
The mental gymnastics and deeply rooted disingenuity required for such behavior is far beyond my intellectual scope, but seems rather common with BU supporters.
In case you read this, werter Herr Bergmann, maybe you can explain your reasoning to us, the ones who do not understand?!
Before you should read this, though:

no! segwit is a huge engine upgrade which also provides new breaks and new tires so you can really use the whole potential of the car, while BU is a giant engine but you are still stuck with your old plastic tires and no breaks.

I give up. Can't argue with someone who claims 1+1=100
100 is still way less than 2600 (50*52) which would be needed in your example without LN.

that's wishful thinking! everyone who realizes that bitcoin can not survive long term with the more than amateurish developer team that classic has assembled will stay true to core and sell their coins on the classic fork.
at least that is what I'm going to do and you can bet a lot of well informed ppl will do the same.
which fork is going to be the better choice only time will tell!
it will hurt bitcoin (price) tremendously in any case! so even though you might not lose any coins, your coins will be worth a lot less if the fork really happens!
so lets hope there will be a some kind of compromise and the fork is off the table or classic goes the same way as XT and we can live happily with the core developers, SW and the core road map ( ever after...

I think you misunderstand a UASF. Sybil nodes are meaningless! The only nodes that count are the ones engaged in economic activity. even a completely meaningful node of a hodler is completely meaningless as long as he doesn't use it to verify new incoming transactions.
If economically important node like the ones from bitpay, coinbase, bitfinex, etc only accept UASF valid coins, the miners can mine as much segwit violating blocks as they want. the block reward of those blocks will be mostly worthless.

but lets try and have a look at what Gavin and Bitcoin Unlimited's [official]( autocratic [judge, jury and executioner]( Andrew Stone (u/thezerg1) have to say:
u/gavinandresen on the issue that the BU fork is going to destroy itself the moment the old chain catches up:


are you fucking serious, Gavin? So users have to change consensus rules based on a whim, to somehow activate a completely uncoordinated hardfork? sure! fool prove idea!


Nice definition you have there. Changing it twice a day is the very essence of a good definition. Makes it more of a living and breathing organism. So much better than the dead and dusty old concept of definitions.


yeah?! more fuzzy concepts we need! hoooray!


The Nakamoto Consensus is such a tyrannical concept! we need to free our self from this consensus tyranny! **One chain per user** is the future! embrace the freedom!


… IF you choose to post in a highly public forum like twitter, you will receive a highly public answer. BUT you could instead choose to explore these important engineering questions privately or semi-privately with the BU team so we can actually help Coinbase come up with a strategy in a “safe space”.
ahh, so because BU regularly proposes nonsense that gets ripped to shreds if discussed publicly, literally hiding in a "save space" is the solution! totally agree! way to go!


well, sorry to break it to you, but you guys called yourself Bitcoin Unlimited already! now you want everyone else to stop calling Bitcoin Bitcoin and instead call BU Bitcoin and Bitcoin Bitcoin old?!
yep sure! totally and 100% going to happen! no doubt about it!


sure, we even have abbreviations already:
BTC (Bitcoin, the one that doesn't break consensus)
LBB (Lage block Bitcoin) or
BUTs (Bitcoin Unlimited Tokens) or
BTU (Bitcoin Unlimited)
I personally think BUTs is the way to go! Has such a nice zing to it!


you got it. that is exactly what is going to happen and Charlie already confirmed it: "[There is absolutely no way I would let GDAX make the reckless decision of supporting BU code as is.](
**tl;dr**: 
exchanges will just stick with BTC, let users withdraw their BUTs so they can dump them if they manage to find a dumping spot.
that's all for the moment! thank you, over and out!
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:59:32
Yeah, sure.... My customers run a lot of different operating systems, but not a single one runs anything, they are not supporting.
That is my whole point. You run what you support. Period. You stop supporting one, when you switch to an alternative. If there is a lack of alternatives, you stick to the best you have.
Edit: 
that's even more true for bitcoin and segwit, since segwit is entirely opt in. You can use it or not. You can run core with or without segwit support or even BU if you want. So anyone running core later than 0.13 clearly supports segwit and your whole argument is moot.
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:42:03
Ok. Name one single bitcoin company that opposes segwit besides bitcoin.com which has the sole purpose of making Roger ver even richer and is therefore arguably not a relevant bitcoin company.
But even if we count bitcoin.com as a relevant company, we are still at 99% segwit support. That's why I consider my 95% claim conservative.
You'll be hard pressed to even find companies that are segwit agnostic. Even coinbase came out to publicly support segwit!

well, the mistake many people do is telling them self: I only invested 5k, 10k, 20k, whatever... I can afford to lose that.
That is a flawed approach. What you actually have to do is reevaluate on a regular basis:
Today your 10k investment form 2012 might be worth a million USD. You might have been OK with losing your initial 10k but are you really, really sure you are OK with losing 1 million?
It really isn't 10k anymore. No matter how hard you try to convince yourself as long as the price goes up.
You will start realizing it, when the price goes down. You risk getting emotional and might end up selling at the absolute wrong time.
I personally think you should have some core holdings, which you'll never sell. That's the amount you are willing to ride down to zero. Then you have a big chunk in the middle which you hold on to as long as we are in a healthy bull market (above 200 day MA/EMA). Last but not least a top chunk spread over the exchanges ready to sell when euphoria kicks in (April/December 2013, November 2015, June 2016 or the last two bubbles).
Sure it's hard to time, thats why that chunk shouldn't be very big, but it's generally a good idea to sell a bit when price goes parabolic. Just buy it back once price comes back down to the 100/200 day EMA.
just my 2 cents...

Well, I see lots of facts and evidence on one side and countless lies and misinformation on the other.
That is the reason why literally every important and reputable actor in this play publicly supports Segwit. Even Brian Hoffman from openbasar joined the club a few days ago. There is literally nobody with any reputation on the BU side. If Gavin had any credibility left, I'd say he is the exception. But unfortunately he hasn't.
The reason being: when actual money is on the line, people tend to do the necessary research sooner or later and become able to make an educated decision.
Name one single bitcoin company that is against segwit and for BU besides Roger's bitcoin.com and Jihan's sockpuppets.
@_date: 2017-03-02 04:54:39
Everyone agrees we can handle a slightly bigger block size if combined with the optimizations provided by segwit.
How do you think a consensus for bigger blocks without segwit is possible, while the majority clearly believe it's not safe.
And even if it would be considered safe, what new "arbitrary" size should it be? There is clearly no agreement or even consensus about that.
There are two options: segwit or status quo. Ironically the ones blocking segwit for the sake of bigger blocks are actually fighting for the status quo and for the small blockers. The smarter ones like jihan from bitmain realize that and abuse you, the big blockers, to achieve their goal: small blocks, ever higher fees and no frictionless second layer to keep all the profits for themself.
You are fooling yourself, if you can't see that.
one could make an even more compelling case about jihan being threatened by the chinese government to take over the control of the bitcoin network via Bitcoin Unlimited.
whichever it is, time to take any power (other than securing the network) away from the miners.

title should read "LNBig grabbed an even bigger share of the LN network capacity to artificially push it above 1000BTC"
they now control more than 75% (&gt;750BTC) of the total LN capacity.
It's mostly wasted capital though. The nodes are badly managed and none of their many channels to my node has _any_ activity at all: 
I heard the same from many other routing node operators who have channels with them.
Even though they have thousands of channels, 25 nodes in total and more than 750BTC capacity all their nodes combined only relayed a bit more than [4000 tx in one month]( 
A great many of those tx are probably being counted many times due to being relayed in between different LNBig nodes.
I know of routing node operators that relay more than twice that amount of transactions (~9,000 a month) with less than 30 BTC capacity and a single node.
My own node relays around 50 tx a day on average (~1500 a month) with just around 90 channels and 8-9 BTC capacity:
(and those are not being counted many times over ;)
I'm really not sure why LNBig is running such an overblown and inefficient operation. It doesn't make much sense and will only play into the hands of people trying to discredit the LN network.

segwit data doesn't exist. What does exist is a new blocksize limit of 4 million weight units which translates to 4MB in extreme conditions. In fact, segwit raised the blocksize limit to 4 MB of which 2-3 MB can actually be used with regular transactions.

I think the only real defense is to keep bitcoin as decentralized and secure as possible.
everyone must be able to run a fully validating node on cheap hardware, with a shitty internet connection behind tor.
it is still possible today and it has to stay that way! that's why any reckless block size increase a la BU should be completely off the table.
governments can't ban bitcoin today because people would just hide their nodes behind tor.
things will be different, when only few people with expensive hardware and huge &amp; costly bandwidth can run full nodes. It would be very easy to regulate those people for example via requiring them to be licensed. 
That would be the end of Bitcoin as free and permission less peer to peer cash. 
but even all that will not be enough, to protect bitcoin long-term. 
the only feasible long-term defense strategy is to block any consensus changes. Only if bitcoin stops changing all together it has a chance to survive really sophisticated social attacks which can easily be backed by billions of dollars.
once bitcoin reaches it's final unchangeable stadium, upgrades will happen on the layers build on top of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:17:18


Yeah, you misunderstand. The major bitcoin update 0.13.1 (which contains segwit and many many other things but is commonly just refered to as segwit) removes technical debt from earlier improvements.
If you need more details, ask the developers.
But even if it were the case, that it ads a bit of technical debt while it removes some more at the same time, saying "segwit ads technical debt" is still hiding the truth and would therefore at the very least considered spreading misinformation!
Calling it a lie is more accurate than calling it true.

segwit increases the block size to at least 2MB and includes improvements that are absolutely needed for further improvements (like a solution to the quadratic sighash problem). It also lays the foundation for further on chain  scaling like schnorr signatures.
That 2MB limit can be further raised via softfork when safe and necessary.

Core gives u 2MB. Faster, safer, more sophisticated and with badly needed malleability patches. Long before any "simple" 2mb hard fork could ever be safely applied!
Now ppl suddenly want 2mb plus segwit. Not possible right now. You have to choose.
Go for the simple 2mb HF or get 2mb in a softfork with segwit from core. It's hard to understand how there is even such a drama when core already figured a way to give you your elegant 100km bridge almost for free!

that is not correct. the core of what makes blocks valid are the consensus rules enforced by the users via full nodes.
the most work is completely irrelevant, if the blocks are not valid.
I hope you can see, where your fundamental misunderstanding are now and why you have some serious misconceptions. 
I hope that will help you seriously reconsider many of the questionable (sometimes just plain wrong) statements you have made here and elsewhere in the past.


I would never fight consensus. I think 1MB is better than 2 but who am I do decide? That's up to every single user.
If there is a paid campaign though, to force unwanted changes, I will fight it with everything I have!
And if there is consensus one day, for something I'm not willing to compromise on, I will just leave. Maybe with a small minority who feels the same.

They would not support it because the split can per definition only happen if miners mine a block where they steal coins from a segwit transaction.
I personally don't see how any exchange could support such a chain without risking serious legal consequences.

if core forks off to a new PoW, we will have three "Bitcoins": Bitcoin (original), BU and Bitcoin core.
The most significant domains, bitcoin.com &amp; btc.com will promote BU as the original/real bitcoin. Nobody knows what will happen to Bitcoin original and Bitcoin core is stuck with less hash power than many altcoins.
there is absolutely no way whatsoever for the price to stay high!
it will take a long time, for the dust to settle. bitcoin core might come out as the winner, but it's likely that it has lost it's first mover advantage and it's network effect to an altcoin. especially since nobody knows, what many of the core devs/contributors will do.
on top of that it is not unreasonable to assume that nation states might support BU, since it can be regulated during one or two entities. They might be unsafe and successfully attacked, but they have the option to switch back to the original &amp; safe Bitcoin code.
No matter how I look at it, I can see absolutely no scenario where bitcoin price stays anywhere high enough to retain its network effect and first mover advantage.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:07:23
well, UASF is to activate segwit, not to prevent the BU fork from happening. in theory coinbase could still pledge 100% support to segwit as a UASF but I doubt they'll do it, they are just cowards.
you need to be pretty dumb to consider BU a viable alternative and to think competing around consensus is a good idea. they have proven again and again that they have no fucking clue how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:09:55


you have no idea how bitcoin works. stop spreading lies.
first of all, no core node will follow in that scenario. they will just discard those blocks with a raised block size as invalid.
even your hypothetical coreBU nodes will consider blocks with a block size &gt;1MB as invalid as long as they are set to EB = 1 and AD = 99999999
so please stop your bullshitting and educate yourself about bitcoins inner workings!

Coinbase and many other exchanges have proven very poor judgment when the ETH fork happened.
Poloniex were the only ones who handled the cluster fuck caused by the Ethereum Foundation competently.
It seems like history will repeat itself! Here is Poloniex statement regarding BU:






it's sad that other major exchanges haven't learned much from the past. They insist on handling this new challenge in a very suboptimal way which will most likely hurt them self and Bitcoin in the process. I'm quite sure, Bitcoin will recover from the FUD. We will see, which exchange will survive. So far I'd only put my bets on Poloniex.
paging u/jespow, and Phil Potter (is he on reddit?)
care to explain why you refuse to firmly speak up against BU and rather stay neutral? Do you really believe BU has a long-term chance of survival in case for example miners attack the core chain successfully and core developers throw in the towel? (I don't really think this will happen, but chances are definitely not 0 at this point).
You have a real chance right here, right now to stand up against all this bullshit and show character, saving your businesses in the process. Or you can just shy away and therefore significantly lower the odds of your exchange and maybe even Bitcoin succeeding.
Learn from Poloniex!

You are taking the analogy to literally now. Yes, we have "guns"! The users are the police, making sure the "guards" can't abuse their power by "forcing" them with their nodes to only mine **valid** blocks. (Actually just rejecting the invalid ones.)


Again: miners DO. NOT. MAKE. DECISIONS! Every single user decides which software to run. Alone, for himself, at home. The power of a decentralized consensus system.
not quite grasping what that means is your fundamental misunderstanding! 


That is a perfectly reasonable position to take and I would absolutely support it, if we can get consensus.
What you can **NOT** do though, is force your opinion on others! and so far it seems, far to many do not agree. Your poll is just another proof!

@_date: 2017-03-09 11:01:14
it is not possible to steal segwit coins on the chain that supports segwit.
miners can in theory though deliberately split the network in a hypothetical [UASF]( by including a transaction that steals segwit coins into a bitcoin block. Updated miners and nodes would reject this block as invalid while not updated ones would accept it.
This can only happen when more than 50% of hashpower has not updated. since [more than 70% of the nodes]( is already segwit ready, the vast majority of the network would reject such a malicious miner fork and the miners would be unable to sell the bitcoins created on that chain, thereby wasting their hashpower.
Because of that fact it is extremely unlikely that such a chain could survive very long. Everyone accepting it as valid risks tremendous financial losses. All network participants are incentived to switch to the updated segwit chain. It has all the upsides and no downsides, since segwit is entirely opt-in and nobody is forced to use it, even on the segwit chain itself.

just because you don't understand how bitcoin works and don't even understood peters or my explanations doesn't mean your skewed understanding becomes suddenly true.

just because there have been improvements to the block relay in the past doesn't mean it's not the bottleneck anymore!

gosh... what is it, that it always feels like you have to educate children, when you argue with BU supporters?
Of course ASICs are specialized hardware. That _IS NOT_ the damn point! A server or even server rack with shitloads of 16 core CPUs is specialized hardware as well. And so is a home PC with 5 Radeon GPUs.
The point is, that Satoshi never anticipated ASICs and mining pools which **invalidated** one of his core assumptions: **One CPU, one vote**.
Someone actually just claimed, he was calling for a moratorium even on GPU mining but was ignored. I'm waiting for a source though, to verify that claim.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:23:31
The reason being: If you hold your coins, you effectively pay the miners, via the block reward for whatever they are doing right now. (the block reward is an inflation "tax" on your holdings).
This means (indirectly) you pay them to fork to BU.
You stop paying them, the moment you sell. This will send a signal to them that we don't approve of their actions.
**IMPORTANT side note:** Vinny is the only one who was consistently correct with his (price)predictions ever since 2012!
I understand that no hodler ever want's to sell. It's a very painful act. I bought my coins in 2012 and I never sold before. After being hesitant for way to long I only managed to sell 30% so far, but considering that this is the **only** way we can make our self be heard I see no other option but to sell more.
Here is a better explanation of Vinny's reasoning by himself:

@_date: 2017-03-05 10:44:22
Who decides which size is needed when? And how do you avoid well connected miners from using such a system to kick less well connected competitors off the network?
How do you avoid state level attackers abusing such a system to centralize and control bitcoin?
There is an answer to those questions: you can't!
That's why smart people try to find smart solutions that are as resilient as possible against those attack vectors. Segwit is one of those smart solutions.
We actually have to assume that we are being attacked from a state level actor right now (possibly China) who is using its power to put pressure on people like Jihan from Bitmain to push for Bitcoin Unlimited and thereby gain more control over the network.
We have do defend against this attack by all means possible!

The new limit is actually 4WU which translates to a post segwit blocksize limit of 4MB. ~2.2 of those 4 MB can be used with current usage. With lightning it could go up to somewhere around 3,6MB max.

While BitPay is pushing this nonsense, there is a coordinated and super effective multilevel attack going on right now:
* *1)* Mempool looks like it is getting spammed like crazy (again) in order to raise fees as high as possible to make it look as if segwit is not enough and we really need to raise the blocksize as well. Mempool has been pretty much empty [for weeks]( I don't believe for a second that it is a coincidence that there are suddenly tens of thousands of transactions right when segwit activated.
* *2)* BCash is purposefully or out of incompetence designed to take away hashpower from BTC in a widely oscilating manner, slowing down confirmation time and reducing the max throughput of the network by [20-30%]( sometimes [up to 50%]( Thereby multiplying the effect of 1)
* *3)* Jihan/Bitmain is mining a lot of empty and half empty blocks which multiplies the effect of 1) even more: 
* *4)* Last but not least there is a massive troll, shill and vote manipulation campaign going on in r/bitcoin. It's worse than any I have ever seen before and it is very sophisticated. The ones pulling it off are very careful to avoid overly polarizing comments and work hard to sound diplomatic. Those two threads are good examples, but it's happening pretty much everywhere:
Anything that subtly favors SegWit2x and the "we need bigger blocks now" narrative is upvoted just enough to always be on top.
I'm sure this thread will be overrun in no time as well. It's already happening right now. the first comments perfectly fit the pattern I just described.

(and yeah, I know the transaction is still unconfirmed on the bitcoin network but it's already confirmed by Bitrefill and the money got credited to my mobile balance right away.)
even if I had to wait another 24 hours for delivery, it wouldn't matter since I actually expected that and just recharged a few days before I would have run out of credit just in case...

OK, I missed that. That is actually a great service. But providing this for free means people will probably take advantage of the offer without really any use for it (wich will lead to more wasted capital). 
Would also make much more sense to run a single node with maybe 20-40BTC capacity plus one or two backup nodes instead of 25 just for the sake of artificially inflating the capacity of the network.
If managed well they could provide a much better service with much less capital and wouldn't make it easy for critics to discredit the LN network due to centralization!

What's worse than the never ending random errors or expired forms, though is the fact that limit orders above or below spread are treated as market orders and market orders don't work at all. They just never make it into the book. Or only after 5-15 minutes. (Support staff confirmed that this a system wide issue a while ago.)
If my limit orders make it into the book (mostly I just get random errors) they do get filled, but only if price moves in my favor. If not, I'm fucked.
Today kraken had a &gt;100$ spread for many hours since they somehow fucked up the login and nobody could get in anymore...
Despite all these issues (and a very long list of other ones) half of me considered staying and I upgraded my account to the highest Tier to be able to transfer between kraken and cold storage. Even with Tier 4 I would have to make many transactions throughout many days, though since withdrawal limits are still ridiculously low.
They really don't want to have customers with more than a handful of coins.
The other half of me thought about leaving since the very beginning because all the glitches and failing matching engine have cost me tens of thousands of dollars already. I always stayed in order to spread my risk across several exchanges. 
Paging u/jespow
I really hope you get your shit together and I can come back one day! 
I also realize that public shaming isn't the nicest way to go about it but I have been super patient and tried many times to sort out these issues with support. When I got a reply (sometimes only after 5 weeks or more) it never helped to resolve the real issues or I was just lectured on the difference between limit and market orders and that I should just use the former since the latter can't be handled by the engine... OK, fine! Then stop treating my limit orders as market orders! And maybe stop offering market orders altogether! 
Mostly support staff actually acknowledged the many issues I was complaining about and asked me to be more patient. I've been patient for 3.5 years!
Today my patience is over and I'm voting with my feet.
I'm honestly amazed that I'm not the last one leaving...
props for the way you handled the Btrash nonsense though. You really did a great job there!

@_date: 2016-06-24 08:39:46
it's safe. thats why it's been upgraded right now to almost 2x (almost 4x in extreme cases) by segwit.
what ppl seem to not be able to understand is that there is no blocksize increase OR segwit. 
it's either a smart blocksize increase with many other improvements to roughly 2x achieved with segwit
OR a dumb blocksize increase by changing the limit to 2x with no other improvements at all.
smart ppl choose option 1, dumb people want 2.

Bitcoin tx are only really safe after at least 1-3 confirmations (10-30 minutes, Maybe hours or days, depending on the fee)
PP &amp; CC transactions are only really safe after the "claw back" period has expired which is either 6 weeks or never in  case of paypal.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:52:14
yeah, the alternative is to build layer 2 and leave the base protocol as is until such day where we all agree on a bigger blocksize. Once it is really needed, agreement will come. until then we have ~2MB segwit blocks, that is already a 100% raise and should help in the short term. Then we'll have schnorr and lightning which might raise capacity another 100-1000x - and if that is not enough, we can always start talking about a hardfork blocksize increase again.
If it is prepared open and under consideration of all stakeholders, not just 5 miners and a few CEOs, consensus should be possible. especially with more optimizations from the hardfork wishlist and enough preparation time and testing beforehand to make it a smooth process

When you say such a thing it is obvious that you don't understand lightning. On chain transactions to open and close a channel can represent hundreds, millions, even billions or more lightning transactions. They can pay a much higher fee then what is being paid today. Saying that miners won't profit from that is just not true.

I just paid my lunch with a 40 sat/byte fee. whats that? 25 cents? I could have paid 20 sat/b but I just wanted to be nice to the miners.
Why would the restaurant care that the transaction will only confirm in 10-30 hours? If I had paid with credit card or paypal, the confirmation would be in 6 weeks or maybe never really (PayPal).
Bitcoin transactions are instant like with CC or PayPal but still much cheaper and settle much faster.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:09:20

sure, happy to quickly go through each of your paragraphs:


yeah, I think most r\btc subscribers and "bigblockers" would agree. The irony is, though, that bigger blocks do nothing in regards to confirmation times. Confirmation time will always be random somewhere between a few seconds and more than one hour (due to the variance in which time span a new block is found).
Only layer 2 can get us faster transactions.


correct. bigger blocks are relatively easy to handle for big miners, but increasingly difficult for smaller ones.
The biggest issue are full nodes though. If you can't run a full node at home from an average internet connection, you can't verify your transactions and incoming coins yourself anymore and need to trust a third party.
As Satoshi said in the very first sentence of the [Bitcoin whitepaper](
 &gt;A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, **but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending**.
This is why it is so important that blocks stay small enough to be handled by average internet connection and cheap hardware.


Yip. But again, nodes are crucial. If only businesses can run nodes, bitcoin becomes just an expensive PayPal. Every business on this planet who operates legally is already regulated today. It would be easy to impose bitcoin node regulations on those businesses as well. A lot of "bigblockers" seem to be unable to understand this point.




yeah. It is certainly a valid argument that bitcoin is in danger as long as it is mostly used for illegal activity. I personally don't think that is a huge worry today anymore. Maybe during the times of Silk Road, but today this argument doesn't justify more centralization anymore.


Yeah, very rough description but correct.

confirmations are never instant. they take 10 minutes on average, sometimes 1 or even 2 hours. Absolutely nothing you can do about it.
It doesn't matter though, since the transaction itself is instant. Same as PayPal or CC. Why would anyone need to wait for the confirmation? No coffee shop makes you wait 6 weeks, just because you paid with CC or did that happen to you?

holy crap! can any core developer confirm this? ? never heard this before...
that's a bit more than much more expensive. that's close to 2 orders of magnitudes more expensive.
so instead of 3-4 tx/s bitcoin would only be able to handle significantly less than 0.01 tx/s or &lt;2000tx/day.
sure, no need to worry too much atm, but if this is true and there actually happens to be a breakthrough in quantum computing, things wouldn't look very good....

I talked to a couple of other people and moderators of this sub and they confirmed that it's pretty much the worst they have seen. I wouldn't make that accusation without getting a few second opinions.
It's not level headed discussions anyway. It's factually wrong comments being posted in huge numbers and getting upvoted a lot.
Maybe it's not obvious to you. Not being too obvious is the whole idea of the campaign anyway. But If a lot of people who spend a lot of time her and even the mods agree, I think it is a fair judgment.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:51:35
makes only sense if you really think it will be much higher than now pre fork. It might be higher in relation to bitcoin but peobably not in dollar terms. the more BCH you dump for BTC, the more S2X you will get to dump for BTC
BCH won't get any S2X
Besides, if S2X doesn't happen, BCH goes down and you lose your free money. I just sold everything at 0.15-0.25 and so far I'm pretty happy about that!

u/xbach 's own tl;dr:


Currently, transactions do not contain the bitcoin value of inputs. Instead, they enclose the reference to the previous transaction, forcing TREZOR to use a workaround in order to safely retrieve the values and verify them. This process, however, takes precious amount of time. With SegWit, this will no longer be necessary as SW transactions include the value of inputs.

I used Mycelium until last week my self! I feel you! But it's not bitcoins fault that you're still using it! I switched to Samourai for exact this reason!

There is an easy to use solution to congestion: pay the adequate and still ridiculously cheap fee!

That you are still vehemently arguing against it, kind of leaves the impression that you're just part of the whole endeavor yourself. Maybe not in a coordinated manner but by just perpetuating the same old lie that this is just civilized discussion.
regarding point 1, It's quite futile to to argue about this anyway, since a sophisticated spam attack is impossible to detect.
Where do you get your data anyway and can you maybe share how you come to the conclusion that there are no more transactions than usual?

Nobody is in control of bitcoin really. When people say users are in control that only means users can decide which node software to run and to hodl, buy more or sell their coins. 
If you are a really competent user, you can even contribute to core or write an alternative client. If your work is good, people might use your code.

People are always quick at screaming "not your keys, not your coins" but i'm pretty sure those people don't have to worry about holding really large amounts.
It's one thing to hold a couple thousands or even ten thousands USD worth of anything at home "under your mattress" 
things get a little different once you talk about hundreds of thousands or even millions.

it's always cheapest on the weekends during the night. but your wallet has a stupid fee estimation algorithm. Like pretty much any wallet. That is why I dumped mycelium and switched to Samourai wallet (android)  - it's the only mobile wallte I know that supports custom fees and replace by fee (RBF)
it's still in beta but works fine. you can import your private keys from you old wallet. you don't need to make a transaction and pay the fee.

@_date: 2017-08-30 14:25:03
More and more NYA signers are coming to the realization that S2X will be just another altcoin without experienced developers. There is just not that much to win by betting everything you worked on for the last couple of years on one single guy who hasn't even the experience to do this job as being part of a team.
I mean, he almost failed to even raise the blocksize in SegWit2x, since [he didn't know what he was doing](
The best thing S2X can hope for is to be a giant mess and set back the whole space for a few years.
Bitcoin is too big and too complicated to be kept afloat by anything less than the best of the best cryptographers with decades of experience. Jeff Garzik might have been a good Linux developer. But it's delusional to think he can handle this all by himself!
Thanks for keeping an open mind and realizing that S2X can't work the way it looks right now. Just blindly going over the cliff is not the way to go! Thumbs up!
I hope more NYA signers are coming to their senses sooner rather than later! Good on Bitwala and Charlie to be the first!

why is this nonsense bein upvoted?
Bitcoin and PayPal transactions are both instant. Bitcoin settles within  ~9 minutes if you pay a high fee and within 12-48 hours is you pay a super low fee (much cheaper than PayPal)
PayPal transactions never really settle. PayPal can and will take your money away from you or revert transactions at any time they deem appropriate!
So bitcoin wins  the comparison in every case. The only downside is it's volatility (which is also it's upside from a speculators perspective)

Edit: and here it comes: 
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:06:08
no, CC transactions settle after roughly 6 weeks. Until that time they can be charged back at any time.
CC and PayPal transactions are instant in the same way bitcoin transactions are instant. Bitcoin usually confirms in ~10 minutes if you pay a high enough fee or in 12-36 hours if you pay a really cheap fee (less than 10 cents for example). CC &amp; PayPal confirm only after 6 weeks or never* respectively. 
They are much, much slower than bitcoin.
*PayPal can and will take your money at any time, if they don't like you for whatever reason.
I have no clue why nobody gets this! I always though that is the most basic common knowledge you can think of in regards to how traditional payment networks work.
Bitcoin is lightning fast in comparison and still way cheaper.
Bitcoin only gets a bit more expensive if you want super fast settlement. Something you will never get with PP or CC, even if you pay all the money in the world!
I pay my lunch or dinner pretty much daily with bitcoin and use the Samourai Android wallet which offers custom fee. I usually add a 10-40 sat/byte fee (~8-30 cents) and the transaction gets almost always confirmed within 24 hours. long after I ate my dinner, but much faster than CC or PayPal. So it's a win/win for me and the restaurant. I don't have to sell my coins for fiat and the restaurant gets the money for free, saves the CC or PP fee and still gets much faster confirmation.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:45:17
they will have to be rolled back. But apparently ViaBTC allows traders to withdraw their bitcoins after they sold their BCH.

that doesn't refute my point and does nothing to back up you claim.
Just because there is a lower acceptance rate doesn't mean the whole situation isn't made worse via spam and other tactics.

I think the essence of the debate is as follows:
One side wants fast adoption and growth, even at the cost of more centralization. Their fear is bitcoin becoming the Myspace of crypto if it doesn't move fast enough. The argument is, the more people use it, the harder it is to regulate, even if it's somewhat centralized.
The other side values independent, sound money that everyone can use without relying on a trusted third party by running a full node on cheap hardware and mediocre internet connection. The fear is government takeover and they are willing to sacrifice fast adoption for more decentralization to gain more resilience.
I could argue for both sides but generally find the arguments of the latter more convincing.
Napster and Paypal was/is used by everyone but still got shut down/tightly regulated. So the argument that lots of users can protect against over-regulation is moot.
Bitcoin becoming the myspace of crypto is an understandable fear but ethereum has shown that every single blockchain based crypto currency has the same issues when it comes to scaling. Bitcoin actually scales far better than pretty much every other altcoin, thanks to it's minimalist and constrained protocol design. So even this argument is not convincing.
Last but not least, building a somewhat slower but resilient base layer keeps the door open for massive second layer scaling. Even if one of the many future top layers fail, the core protocol still stands.
If too much is crammed into the core protocol, the risk of failure goes up tremendously and when it happens, we are left with nothing but ruins.
You can always build more effective, cheaper, faster and centralized layers on top of a decentralized base layer. But you can't build more decentralized layers on top of a centralized base layer.

I think you don't know how sophisticated, well targeted spam attacks work. If you time it right you need much less transactions than you'd expect and if you control large amount of hash power you earn back a big part of the fees. Normal people paying super high fees might even make this endeavor net positive.
Another technique that is probably used is to just fill your own blocks with a lot of your own transactions and sell the remaining block space super expensive. Also possibly net positive.
But even if it is costly, the reward is the whole bitcoin network if people end up falling for and supporting SegWig2x.
It's the biggest prize the planet has to offer right now. Don't be naive and assume nobody is spending huge amounts in order to have a chance at winning.

People are literally forbidden to pay less with 90% or more of the wallets out there.
And even the wallets that offer custom fees are hiding the option (like Samourai) and refuse to offer cheaper standard options.
As an average Joe you have absolutely no way to pay less than 250 sat/byte right now. Even if you wanted to!
That means you are forced to overpay 800%

@_date: 2017-08-27 23:20:08
well, the TX's aren't very comparable. the crux of the matter is:
the merchant has to trust you that your CC is valid and not stolen. Same as he has to trust you to not double spend on him, if you pay with BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:23:39
You have to think a bit further! If S2X forks without replay protection, the fork will be a giant mess, both chains will be unusable for days, possibly weeks and the price will crash (maybe even below 1000$). a lot of people will hedge into LTC, ETH and BCH! It will look like bitcoin is dying while BCash is going up like crazy. Of course everyone who supports BCash wants exactly that! (At least the ones who can think that far and are interested in a high BCH price).

you mean 90% of the remaining 55%? almost 45% of hashpower just switched to BCash: 
They will come back in 6 hours, when BCash won't be profitable to mine anymore: 
So bitcoin will be fine, but it shows that miners don't give two shits about agreements. They only care about profit. As long as bitcoin has a higher price than SegWit2x, most  miners will stick to bitcoin.

No, you can run a fullnode via this satellite link. even with the shittiest or no internet at all.

@_date: 2017-08-25 23:21:37
Centralized systems will always be cheaper than decentralized ones. You need to educate yourself about the fundamentals of bitcoin.
Only somewhat more centralized layer 2 solutions like lightning could hopefully be cheaper than CC or PayPal in the hopefully not so distant future.
On chain transactions will never be cheap. If they were, miners wouldn't get paid in a couple of years.
Satoshi assumed fraud proofs to be possible when he argued that very big blocks should be feasible without harming decentralization and censorship resistance. Unfortunately so far nobody figured out a way to make proper fraud proofs a reality. So for now we are quite limited in regards to max blocksize without compromising the network.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:53:10
Sure. If you would actually be able to read and comprehend what I wrote, you would realize that what you're saying makes absolutely no sense whatsoever as long as you don't specify what kind of transaction you're talking about.
In terms of fees vs. settlement time bitcoin beats PayPal and CC a hundred times over!
A bitcoin transaction with &lt;10 sat/b fee (&lt;10cents) will settle within 1-3 days, while PP &amp; CC transactions will never settle faster that 6 weeks and still cost at least 1,5 - 5% plus ~35 cent minimum charge.
All three are almost instant and all three require internet but only bitcoin works without a trusted third party.
So bitcoin beats both, CC &amp; PP in every regard plus offers the option to get lightning fast settlement within ~10 minutes if you need it and are willing to pay for it. That's something you will never get from PP or CC even if you offer all the money in the world.

**Edit:** 
I should clarify: NO to forking without consensus. But since 63% are against forking no matter what, consensus for a fork is literally impossible to reach right now.
I made a similar poll in June and it seems like today even less people are willing to fork campered to back then! In my poll it were still 19% vs. 81% unsure or opposed:
Of course, we all know, twitter polls are far from perfect! But show me the polls that show the opposite or even a different tendency?!

since that is obviously not going to happen, you are actually not hard forking bitcoin to upgrade it. Instead you are creating an altcoin.
So the question why you don't like bitcoin and rather fork off to an altcoin that threatens to attack bitcoin (no replay protection) is indeed valid and has no false pretext.

maybe nobody ever told you that twitter, unlike trump mail, has a retweet funktion.
As I said, it's still not the best metric, but it's quite telling that no polls exist that have opposing results, don't you think?!
If the results were that far off, S2X supporters would be able to show it somehow. For example by running twitter polls themself between their own follower base.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:29:22

BCash (BCH) aka Bitmain Coin (BMC) has completely different difficulty retargeting than Bitcoin. It should happen much faster:


Maybe they are intentionally waiting those 12 hours to not lose bitcoin mining revenue and shift more hashrate later, which would also accelerate the BCash chain significantly if the shift happens after the difficulty has been adjusted to much lower hashpower.
But this makes it just another shitcoin even by very favorable definitions.

But its still spam and the need for him to pay high fees is an important property of bitcoin.
So when people use spam to advocate for bigger blocks, they have it completely backwards. If it's still cheap enough that some entity can afford to spam the network, the blockspace is probably too cheap and we should advocate for smaller blocks!

LND is prioritizing new features and development speed over fixing bugs, whereas eclairs number one priority is bug fixing and stability.
It's pretty obvious if you check their respective githubs: 
LND has 23 open issues labeled as bugs and quite a few more that for whatever reason just didn't get the bug label. Eclair has not a singel issue open with a bug on their end and one which is actually about a bug on the peers side.
That also explains why LND has so much more people using it. Everybody wants the newest feature fast and most don't care too much about network stability and bugs. It's quite unfortunate since this makes the network much more unstable and immature than it could be.
Even c-lightning devs care way less about bugs than they should:
they don't even label very severe bugs like this one as a bug: 
this bug just caused my high capacity, high activity [channel]( to fail and getting force closed yesterday. This costs my peer, me and node operators in general a lot of money! Still, they label it as low priority and refuse to fix it since months...


none of the top LND nodes is running on rpi's! they all run on dedicated servers! You can't even have more than ~80 channels on a rpi with LND so I'd say your argument doesn't really make any sense.
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that different implementations with different priority sets exist, but bug fixing and stability should imho be much higher on the list of the LND and c-lightning devs!

You really need to educate yourself about the insane fraud levels when it comes to PP &amp; CC! 
And no, the merchant is not protect. He just loses all the money in case of a chargeback.
In some areas (porn, gambling, etc...) chargeback rates are [insanely high](
So unfortunately anything you say is build on false assumptions.
I pay with bitcoin everyday and you never have to wait for a confirmation in real life. Why would you? They trust you anyway or why would they serve you before you pay the bill?
But it's always nice when people who never use bitcoin are trying to lecture those who do on a daily basis. I don't have fiat! I have nothing else than bitcoin. Believe it or not but I'm forced to deal with this every single day!
If it were as you say, bitcoin would indeed be unusable. But that's just a perpetuated lie being told over and over again to push for a certain narrative.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:04:45
I actually overpaid :-/ usually I add a 20 or 40 sat/byte fee when I pay for my lunch or dinner with bitcoin (pretty much every day).
Sure the confirmation will take a few hours, maybe even more than a day when the network is really congested but why does it matter?
Why would the restaurant care? If I had paid with credit card or PayPal, the confirmation would be in 6 weeks or maybe never really (or is it 6 months with PayPal?!).
Bitcoin transactions are instant like with CC or PayPal but still much cheaper and settle much faster.
If I were a restaurant I'd take a payment that arrives instant, settles within hours and cost me nothing over a costly and prone to charge back CC or PayPal transaction every. single. time!

bitfinex introduced futures for segwit2x which traded at around 10-25% the price of BTC iirc. This is the only really hard and expensive to manipulate metric we have.
It also pretty accurately reflects my perception of the level of support in the community at the time. I spend pretty much 100% of my time engaging with the different factions of the community over reddit, twitter, telegram and IRC at the time since all my life savings were threatened to be completely destroyed.
I think I can claim I had a VERY strong financial but also non financial incentive to try to figure out where the real support was and how things would most likely develop. 
I also decided to sell 60% of my segwit2x coins 1 for one for BTC to a segwit2x supporter long before the futures market existed. We both locked up our BTC in escrow and I got back BTC while he (did not) get back any S2X.
I'm mentioning this to highlight the fact that even from the very beginning it was clear that segwit2x was going to fail. At least to anyone paying close attention and cutting through the insane amount of noise and FUD.
There is absolutely no doubt that there was never anymore than maybe 25-30% support. Anyone claiming otherwise is just completely uninformed.

Nobody said anything about "requiring" a trusted list! It just has to be the standard option to keep the average user safe!
everyone can setup their own electrum server. 
if you download electrum and start it for the first time, do you rather want a standard setting where it connects to a random fishing server that steals your coin or do you want it to connect to a much safer server from a list of trusted servers? 
All you need is an advanced option that lets you connect to any server of your liking! Simple, right?! Would probably be good to ad a scary warning that you have to choose wisely or you'll risk losing your coins.
Do you think SPV wallets connect to random servers? Of course not! It would be an absolute disaster. Hundreds of people would lose their coins. It would be exactly how it is with electrum right now.

Because I can't?! That's not how LN works. As long as you only send payments, there is absolutely no way ever for anyone to steal even one satoshi from you. This would only be a theoretical possibility if you had received funds already.
But IF I'd try to steal your funds, I'd risk losing everything in case you switch your phone back on within 1-14 days (depending on your settings).
Nobody in their right mind would even try.
In fact, the risk is so high that pretty much the only known cases of lost funds in LN are due to people restoring their node from a backup, accidentally publishing an old state and getting their funds taken away from their peers as a punishment for publishing an old state.
That's akin to you taking my funds, not the other way around! ;)

We need a strong immune system against evil soft forks!
The earlier it happens, the better. The Segwit2x failure has shown that the ones calling the shots in Bitcoin, the non fence sitting hodlers and BTC acquiring traders, those who are willing to sell one side of a fork and buy the other, are still mostly aligned with Bitcoins core principles of sound hard money.

He basically hodled from $200 until $10,000 and then sold like a pro. I bet by now pretty much anyone is secretly dreaming of being  a bad ass trader like Kobayashi!
I for one am pretty damn happy he sold at 10k and not at 200 or whatever...

Well, here is another historic fact for you:
XT was Mike Hearns private take over attack on Bitcoin, supported by Gavin. Literally _none_ of the other dozens and dozens if not hundreds of other developers was supporting it.
Some people who didn't quite realize the ramifications or were fine fine with the idea of having Mike as the "benevolent dictator" of bitcoin did support XT. _Everyone_ else opposed it vehemently.
Nothing can change those historic facts either!
There is absolutely no doubt to me and anyone who values decentralization that XT would've killed bitcoin, if successful. 
Hearn as the CEO of Bitcoin?!
What the actual fuck?! Everyone supporting XT is outing himself as an enemy of Bitcoin. Some just don't realize it.

If the name core would be abandoned and replaced with the original "Bitcoin" or cores predecessor "Bitcoin QT" everyone would realize right away how ridiculous it would be to demand something from Bitcoin or from Bitcoin QT.
"When is Bitcoin giving us &lt;insert wish&gt;"?
"Why is Bitcoin QT not following through on the HK agreement?"
It sounds as ridiculous as it actually is to ask that from "core"!
It's an open source software implementation developed by 100+ individuals!
If Gavin didn't push the name "Bitcoin Core" through, a lot more people would realize how ridiculous many of the things are, they are demanding!
Other developers at the time voiced reservations against the name, since it implies to be essential und irreplaceable. It's not! whichever group of developers delivers the best code will end up being the de facto reference implementation. Period!
That's how it always was and always should be. Core is just a fancy name to show off and does way more harm than good!

So we are effectively giving up on segwit and _all_ it's improvements for fear of some future malicious block which would be refused by 80-95% of the network anyway.
In case nobody has noticed, 400 UASF nodes will do Jack shit and anyone expecting all major exchanges to jump on the UASF train is completely delusional!
Even on fucking Twitter polls UASF only gets something in the ballpark of 25%
We have consensus for segwit already and instead of just activating it after the flag day we are sacrificing it for a delusional pipe dream.

@_date: 2016-02-14 19:22:45
Yeah, if you refuse to pay even the tiny amount of 4 cents (the standard fee) you might have to wait. If you do pay, everything works as intended.
If you want to be extra sure to get in the next block, you can prioritize your transaction with 2 cents extra.
But I get it. That's just too much! Bitcoin should give us free transactions and a free beer each time we transfer anything!

So you agree fees are the only mechanism to control spam (+optimising for monetary value transfer). But you say block size is irrelevant for fees and therefore for spam control.
One of the arguments for a limited block size has always been the assumption that block size as a limited resource will create a healthy fee market which will fix many broken incentives and make bitcoin sustainable in the long run.
It seems like the predictions were correct and this is exactly what happened. Fees did rise, spam got much more expensive.
Now you're telling me, block size is irrelevant for fees?!
Sorry, no matter how much I think about it, I can't follow your reasoning.

That is an awesome approach. I'm happy to support it! The screwed incentives of journalism are one of the most pressing issues mankind faces at the moment. It can potentially have a significant effect on many other pressing issues like corruption, climate change, etc...
I keep a (pretty short) list of issues I consider urgent and significant for all or large parts of mankind. 
I think it would be great to create some kind of public database to have a central place to go for all sorts of information, discussion, current state of research, possible solutions and so forth.
There are many entrepreneurs out there who are more interested in making a difference as opposed to just get rich quick. A public database and discussion forum might be able to help the cause. Anyone could participate and help making a difference even by just submitting whatever deemed important. If others agree, it will draw attention.

so you say "simply not true" and then proceed by confirming my claim while saying you might _attempt_ to fix it _later this year_.
maybe next year? maybe not at all? Why didn't you fix it after the issue became obvious?


Not a perfect solution?! Are you kidding me? By that metric bitcoin.org should be listed as well and with a higher weight! As should be r/bitcoin and bitcointalk and who knows who else!
bitcoin.com mainly scams it's customers with a promise of &gt;23% cloud mining profit [**per month**]( and other than that promotes broken and consensus breaking code! Why is it even in that list? Every Bitcoin accepting gambling site is much more relevant!


I never heard of any of the non mining BU supporting companies for example. Seems to me I can set up a bunch of fake companies and get them listed as segwit supporters?!

Same happened to a friend. He send a couple thousand Euro when price was around 700$. His account got instantly frozen, once the money arrived. it took ages and ages and many hoops to jump through until he was able to trade. (only after price had gone beyond 1200$).
I'm trading quite frequently on kraken myself. It's a horrible experience but I want to spread my risk across at least 5 exchanges.
On my last trade I lost a couple 100 bucks because my order wasn't submitted even though the interface showed it as submitted. I had to cancel and resubmit more than 3 times before it finally showed up. Meanwhile the price had been rising significantly.

it seems to be more factual, that they are *naturally* rising in fiat equivalent (*only*) due to the rising bitcoin price. measured in bitcoin they are fairly flat and only rise for short periods of time during attacks ("capacity testes") of the network.
segwit will give you a significant discount on the necessary fee. so the exact opposite of your statement is true:
fees are being artificially lowered (through segwit)...

but after reading everything i found and considering the arguments from both sides i find it absolutely mindboggling that there even are more than a few retards seriously considering classic. gavin has been wrong so many times that i honestly get the feeling, we would be better off without him (and garzik for that matter).
i made my educated decision. you can call it what you want.

if you are not willing to pay for your transaction it's obviously not very important to you. being forced to pay is not a very elegant solution (and I agree that it may kill a few non-spam transactions as well), but the only solution we have as long as we don't have a better system than a capitalism.

It would be irrelevant. Splits happen every day and get orphaned right away. Segwit violating blocks would be rejected by the vast majority today already. Coins from the forked chain are worthless. Even if some dumb miners insist on wasting money on such a fork for an extended period of time.
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:54:04


it would only be a loss if they were using the cover method or at least planing to use it. If they don't it would actually be a win, since it prevents competitors from using it.
Since they oppose stopping it, it's pretty damn obvious that they are actively using it right now. Besides, we have huge amounts of circumstantial evidence:
* 
(Jihan indirectly confirms that they are using ASICBOOST on weibo)
* 
(Jihan indirectly confirms that they are using it on twitter, then deletes tweets)
* Empty blocks is good for ASICBOOST (**Antpool is mining lots of empty blocks**)
* weird transaction shuffling is necessary for ASICBOOST. **Bitmain engages in weird transaction shuffling**:
* someone actually found the stratum command used to activate ASICBOOST on antminers pointed to Antpool some 9 months ago: 
* segwit (unintentionally) breaks the covert form of ASCIBOOST. **Bitmain oposes segwit**.
* SegWit2MB, BU and Extension Blocks does not break covert ASICBOOST. **Bitmain supports all of those proposals**.
* Greg's fix blocks only covert ASICBOOST - it does literally nothing else. **ANY** miner not using covert ASICBOOST profits from such a fix since it prevents the competition from secretly using it. **Bitmain opposes the fix**.
I could go on all day, but I need to go. Should be sufficient for the time being...

You might wanna get your facts straight. 20MB would have broken bitcoin, 8MB would have broken bitcoin. Even 4 or 3MB aren't safe which is why Jonathan Tomim and "classic" are going for 2MB. It's not a compromise to make more ppl happy, it's the maximum size possible right now. Read tomims test results!
Core gives you almost 2MB in a safer way WITH much needed malleablility fixes and much more. Basically the best things since sliced bread was invented.
"classic" only gives you a dumb 2MB hard fork, without all the long needed fixes.

Well, I'm sure he meant 1$ per average transaction (~250 bytes).
I really don't see how any concept of spam makes much sense besides optimizing for "legit use" (which I'm hearing for the first time, actually).
So far I only recall you pushing for smaller blocks as main (if not only) strategy.
At the end of the day the only thing that matters is who is willing to pay the fee. bitcoin is permissionless and any definition of spam is moot.
Besides, as I said, optimizing for monetary value transfer, which I agree with, but never heard before of.

This is the definition of "more scaling war"!
It's complete nonsense! There can never be a compromise without consensus. This proposal might have 50% support at best. The way it was proposed is very shady (lobbying support through back channels before the actual proposal to the dev mailing list).
It would be worth discussing if it had at least super majority support. It has not and for good reason!  
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:55:18

jip, here is a very useful historical node count chart: 
It's pretty much [perfectly correlated]( with BTC price which is why u/luke-jr recent [april fools prank BIP]( to soft fork a minimum BTC price of USD 50k ironically makes much more sense and is much more likely to reach his stated goal of more full nodes than his serious [300kb blocksize BIP]( which would crash BTC price and node count in concert.
It's a bit unfortunate that he doesn't seem to understand this himself...
To be fair, he always talks about number of full nodes in relation to Bitcoin user count and it seems like he prefers a lower BTC price, less users, less full nodes but higher percentage of users running a full node over a higher BTC price, higher absolute node count but lower percentage of user running a full node.
Luckily he is pretty much alone with his view for obvious reasons ...
He is also wrong in the assumption that the latter would make Bitcoin more secure, imho. Bitcoin being forced into a small niche would make it *less* resilient against powerful adversaries than it being mainstream with a much larger full node count but a smaller percentage of users running one.
Tor is a perfect example. Germany want's to make it illegal and could reasonably do so. Were Tor used much more widely with more relays and exit nodes it would be much harder to illegalize/shut down, even if a smaller percentage of users actually operated exit or relay nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:10:15
from what I've gathered on first glance this forces you to upgrade or otherwise degrades your full node to SPV level security.
It has the enormous risks and costs of a hard fork but none of it's upsides.
But regardless of any risks or advantages, miners softforking these kind of changes without consensus is a very serious attack and preparing it secretly is absolutely outrageous.
I just voted with my coins. I will not have any of this bullshit!

of course it will lead to more centralization _because_ it is a block size increase.
it just happens to have a lot of improvements to hopefully offset most of the centralization pressure.
that's why it _is_ the _only_ scaling compromise with a realistic chance of consensus and activation.
everything else is just noise or nonsense or even purposeful stalling tactic.

Eric Lombrozo's take on it:


 


and Matt Corallo's reply:


in a footnote of the original sidechains paper, the idea that miners
will start soft-forking in sidechains is a massive risk - it allows
individual large miners and individual economic users to force others to
switch to new consensus rules, with potentially little consensus or review.

the main reason to run a node is to verify your incoming transactions. nothing of what you said has any relevance. just don't give anyone a segwit address and there is no way you'll ever receive a segwit transaction. your old node can verify your non-segwit transaction just fine.
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:58:06


Nonsense! ETC proves you wrong.


Nonsense. Segwit is secure since it can't happen before overwhelming support. Old nodes will still work and can upgrade on their own time frame to regain full security.

I'd say it's a major red flag when someone selling cloud mining contracts knows nothing about mining.
you can use covert ASICBoost without any issues and never mine a single empty block. You have clearly no clue whatsoever. the only thing you need to do is shuffle 12-18 transactions accordingly to be able to find collisions. the rest of the block can be filled with transactions ordered after fee. that's why covert ASICBoost is undetectable if it's done properly. obviously mining almost empty blocks with 12-18 transactions makes ASICBoost even easier but it's pretty dumb since obvious. 
but since cloud mining is a scam by definition it probably doesn't matter much anyway.
making money mining for yourself is already tricky enough. marketing and selling cloud mining contracts costs shitloads of money on top of that. 
giving away all you profits while significantly rising your operation cost is either retarded or a scam. period.
if you are running a legit business, getting a loan from a bank is orders of magnitudes cheaper than raising money via cloud mining.

no FUD. First of all you completely miss my point which is rising price triggers rising node count numbers and vice versa. Second, price seems to have at least some correlation with blocksize as the segwit blocksize increase clearly shows. it triggered the most insane bull market in history.
not saying that another blocksize increase would raise price but a reduction could potentially reverse the price rally the segwit increase triggered.

developer consensus is reached via open and public discussions on the mailing list and the bitcoin_dev IRC channels (both are logged and preserved. You can read every single word posted there yourself), as well as the peer reviewed BIP process on Github.
Miners have no more say than any other user. BIP9 was introduced with the assumption that miners cooperate and follow consensus. It probably has to be abandoned due to hostile miners.
New upgrade mechanisms need to be developed and vetted.

I was only able to quickly scroll through before closing the tab in disgust. When I decided to report it, I tried but wasn't able to find it again since your link collection is so insanely big. It's like searching for a needle in the biggest haystack you could possible imagine.
I was only able to bookmark the two most likely categories where I believe it showed up:
I'll have another look when I find the time but I doubt I'll be able to find it.
What is your objective with those LN nodes with very high fee rate? I assume just to earn some routing fees? You are risking a huge amount of money with little chance of getting people route through you due to those high fees. Even if they did, it would be pennies for literally millions of USD you are risking to very new and buggy beta software!
Seems a bit suspicious to me. The risk of losing money is not just theoretical. It's very real. I learned that lessen with my own LN node...

Hi LNBIG owner!
I'm viajero_loco from reddit. I had some issues with my LN node and until now was only able to reply on reddit: 
Your last comment about reducing the fee got me somewhat convinced that your intentions are indeed good. I still don't understand why you run that many nodes and risk that much capacity but at the end of the day it's permissionless technology and your are free to do whatever you want.
Please keep in mind that even though the reporting about your activity has been pretty much 100% positive so far it would be easy to point out that one entity now controls more than 70% of the lightning network which makes it quite centralized.
If you really wanna help the lightning network, maybe it would be wise to at least not grab an even bigger share of the whole network. Maybe consider reducing it to the point where most of the liquidity isn't just mostly wasted anyway.
Anyway, it's your call. Thanks for adding liquidity and I hope there won't be any unpleasant surprises that could hurt the growth and adoption of this very young and probably not yet very resilient network.

@_date: 2019-01-11 19:37:49
unfortunately this is not true. The spam attack was likely a net positive for bitmain and it will remain a viable/profitable attack vector until fees surpass blockreward. probably long after that.
Only once blockreward is insignificant, the attack will be less viable. Could still be profitable under certain circumstances.

@_date: 2018-02-25 18:22:30
I disagree. This is the only part where the incentive system doesn't work. Miners are always incentivised to raise fees for everyone via spam attacks. It is a serious problem.
The reason the attack has stopped is most likely the realization that it would accelerate development, deployment and adoption of the lightning network.
The spammers were hoping their efforts would lead to a blocksize increase. Now that it became clear that it won't happen a quicker lightning adoption would probably hurt their bottom line more than higher fees reaped via spam attack.
Another reason is probably the fact that spam attacks are much easier and more efficient to pull off during times of high congestion

Wrong. Miners will mine double spends in the order they received them. NOT higher fee first. That is only true for regular transactions.

I get my pizza, the restaurant gets their money and bitpay worst case has to wait a couple of weeks to get the coins. (usually just a couple of hours or 1-2 days though)

That's all very interesting but has nothing to do with the point I'm making: nobody is using BTC even when it's cheap and convenient if you do it right. Since nobody is using it while it's cheap,  high fees aren't hindering adoption.
The narrative is just plain false!


I have no Idea, what you are talking about! during the peak spam attack my 20-60 sat/byte transactions took a couple of weeks to confirm. 95% of the time my 5-15 sat/byte transactions are getting confirmed within hours. There have been only ~4 months in bitcoins entire history where 5-15 s/b didn't get you a reasonable quick confirmation. That might change in the future, but so far it's not a big issue in the grand scheme of things. 4 months out of the 108 months of Bitcoins existence is less than 4%!
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:53:10
This is only true if they hold their profits in bitcoin which doesn't seem to be the case. Virtually all miners besides bitfury and slush have proven to give zero fucks about bitcoins success or failure when they switched over to bcash without any hesitation.
As Tracy Mayer said, we have to assume that miners are hostile to bitcoin and might even have an interest in its failure.
And quite frankly, past behavior seems to indicate that that's not just a necessary assumption but an actual fact.

I agree. That's my whole point!
The thing is, bitcoin is super useful to pay for shit on the internet or even in real life. So once price stabilizes more it will actually be more convenient to pay with BTC in some cases. Even for normal people.
I travel a lot and I'm a victim of credit card fraud on a regular basis. It's always a huge pain in the ass (how do you get a new card when you are in bum fuck nowhere and have no idea where you gonna be tomorrow?!).

Vinny's statement is flawed on every possible level:


1. Miners are nothing more than security guards of the network. They have the power to order transactions into blocks. Nothing more, nothing less. They have absolutely no more say than any other random user with comparable economic activity.
2. Businesses don't represent users. Vinny is super naive, gullible or even malicious when he says stuff like that. I'm a customer of PayPal, Visa and many other companies. NONE OF THEM REPRESENTS ME!
3. All the power rests with the users! Nobody can overrule them! Backwards incompatible changes like hardforks are only possible with consensus; when literally everyone agrees. Otherwise it will just create another altcoin.
Vinny Lingham, Erik Vorhees, Barry Silbert &amp; co are a serious threat to bitcoin due to their utter and complete cluelesness combined with significant power as leaders of big bitcoin businesses.
I'm not worried their power could be an existential threat to bitcoin, but their power is certainly big enough to wreck havoc on the network come November and the S2X hardfork.
It's very likely S2X will be abandoned or postponed indefinitely in the coming weeks but we need to be prepared in case miners and businesses are stupid enough to go through and create a giant mess.
The more people are educated and understand what bitcoin really is about the fewer will jump over the cliff together with those clueless CEOs and VCs.

nope, 90% of hashrate will mine the most profitable coin. Have you been hiding in a cave the last couple weeks? Just look at what happened when BCash forked off.
S2X will have as much hashpower as it's price supports. 
Circumstantial evidence leads me to the conclusion that S2X will have a significant lower price than BTC and therefore significant less hashpower.
I don't just say this like a lot of people say a lot of things all the times, I actually sold a very significant part of my future S2X coins 1 for 1 for BTC. I placed my bet and put a lot of money where my mouth is.
If I'm right I will profit big time, if I'm wrong I will lose a lot of money.

jip! everytime there is an option to pay via BTC but not via LN it's kinda frustrating. waiting for confirmations and having to pay onchain fees is super annoying. Especially since murphy's law always seems to be in effect! as soon as you send your onchain tx the miners get unlucky, no blocks for 30, 40 60 minutes, fees go through the roof und you are stuck and can't really use RBF since you never know if the receiving side actually supports it. If not, your coins might be gone for good as soon as you bump the fee. Has happened to me repeatedly :(
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:01:19
nope. There are only 3 notable implementations (LND, c-lightning and eclair) which are all still in early development.
If there were anything else for litecoin, it would also exist for bitcoin since litecoin is more or less identical to bitcoin safe for the name and the hash algo.

Oh shut up. Bitcoin is experimental technology very much in beta.

sure... battle tested... you do realise there was a super serious bug just a year ago that could've potentially killed or at least seriously damaged the trust in Bitcoin: 
Bitcoin will be battle tested, once it survived a couple nation state sponsored attacks. Maybe... until then very much an experiment that could fail any moment!
I'm not actually disagreeing with you in regards to LN. you just fail to acknowledge that even Bitcoin is beta and if people use either Bitcoin or LN without properly educating themselfs they will lose money. Should be obvious to most people here in r/bitcoin hence I didn't think I had to mention it in the title. Not that it would be possible due to the limited space available anyway.

Yeah, I'd be more than happy to hear whats going on and why they aren't taking any orders.

OK, the update just became available. Still missing a truly custom fee option but it's already a million times better than before. Good job and thank you!
Will you publicly announce that you will protect users who wish to stay on bitcoin and don't want to get dragged into S2X?
Would be great. If it happens, I'm more than happy to recommend mycelium again.

In case there are still people out there who haven't noticed: small blocks don't exist anymore! Segwit raised the block size**limit** to 4MB - smallblockers compromised and became smartblockers.
Bigblockers are stuck in the past or on the way of becoming smartblockers themself.
What are you?

It's probably because he tries to route through his own node which has ridiculously high fees (which causes routing errors). A lot of people asked him why he is doing this and he never answers.
It seems a bit as if he is intentionally setting things up way to complicated and with way to high fees so he can claim things are way to complicated and don't work....
He is also not mentioning that things are intentionally made complicated at the moment (not as much as he claims it to be though) to prevent noobs from losing their money...

try paying a bitpay invoice with RBF enabled. Once you actually bump the fee, your coins are lost. Good luck trying to get them back.
with merchants using coinbase as their payments processor, I fear it's the same issue. Didn't try though, since I was worried it might be the case. Did lose my coins regardless, since there was no block found for 40 minutes and the timer timed out before my tx was confirmed.
Since I now lost coins repeatedly, I won't pay merchants with bitcoin onchain anymore. Either lightning or fuck off.

I already replied to the same objection elsewhere in this thread:










but I'm glad you got the important part! Locking them in a LN channel is completely contradictory! Only in a LN channel coins are free from unpredictable confirmation times and expensive onchain fees!
*And I also thought it would be obvious that this is a bit of a joke meant to make fun of r\btc people and Roger who are busy all day everyday shitting on LN and telling everyone how they have to lock up their funds and will lose everything and nothing works, while the truth is mostly the exact opposite...*

yes, definitly safer to have them locked up in cold storage (as long as you know how to properly manage cold storage without losing access).
Bitcoin in lightning are hot and ready to use but also ready to be stolen. You should only set as many coins free in LN as you are willing to lose!
But then again, you shouldn't put more money into bitcoin than you are willing to lose.... so I guess it comes down to personal risk tolerance either way...

@_date: 2017-05-22 07:46:08
Nope! This will be a disaster since it has not enough support (less than [25% if Twitter polls]( are any indication).
The core devs would commit reputational suicide to support it. Without their support it is DoA and can only lead to major disruption at best.
I and many others will vehemently oppose this. If one side wants segwit as a hard fork and the other side wants segwit without, doing it with a hard fork is not even a compromise!
Despite, these kind of [horse trading proposals]( are the worst way of doing development and will be rejected out of principle anyway!
The [IETF]( (**which develops the standards for the freaking internet**) on horse trading:


   your proposal for such-and-so reasons.  You object to my proposal for
   this-and-that reason.  Neither of us agree.  If you stop objecting to
   my proposal, I'll stop objecting to your proposal and we'll put them
   both in."  That again results in an "agreement" of sorts, but instead
   of just one outstanding unaddressed issue, this sort of compromise
   results in two, again ignoring them for the sake of expedience.
   &gt;**These sorts of "capitulation" or "horse-trading" compromises have no
   place in consensus decision making**

Bandwidth requirements for full nodes are already a serious issue. Segwits block size increase will only make it worse, unfortunately. 
**The reason it was done nonetheless is to compromise with big blockers and double the capacity of the network.**
It is still much safer than any other option though, since it has a lot of optimizations which can hopefully offset most of the centralization pressure.

so far we only have [polls]( on [twitter]( the known reorg risks of the legacy chain and comments from people like Eric and Peter who will abandon the legacy chain.
which chain will you prefer? the one with Jeff Garzik as lone developer and Jihan as lone miner (dictator) or the segwit chain with the core developers?
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:56:13
I've been arguing with Luke and others against BIP148 for the longest time. Mostly because it forks segwit supporting nodes and agnostic miners off, but at this point Jihan's and Barry Silberts actions unfortunately annihilated the option to wait for a safe segwit deployment via BIP149.
Jihan is using his ASICBoost millions to buy everyone who is for sale and has no integrity like the RSK Team, BitPay and God knows who else to leverage them in his quest to save face and/or ASICBoost, while Barry and the industry are pushing for a hostile takeover of the network via a contentious hard fork.
As Vinny Lingham [put it](


There is no place in bitcoin for forced solutions nobody wants but the few forcing them.
I have no interest in a bitcoin controlled by one single hostile miner or backroom deals of the industry.
At this point the potential chaos and turmoil BIP148 can cause is the smaller evil compared to the other options we have left.
Glad to see Peter Todd coming to the same conclusion and joining the UASF supporters.
The more support, the smother and quicker it will go. Hopefully some more of the important players realize that in time...

@_date: 2017-05-23 08:09:30
That's a problematic statement. Technically they shouldn't operate by the whims of the majority.
What matters is consensus which is hard to gauge.
For a hard fork, pretty much everyone need at least not oppose the proposed changes. For a soft fork I'd say the majority of the users plus developer consensus should be sufficient.
Also depends on the kinds of changes the soft fork in question is trying to make though.
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:55:04

If node operators have to pay the cost for people who can't afford the fees but can still transact thanks to artificially low fees, the network will die in no time.
It's not sustainable.
Bitcoin is not a charity!
Segwit will enable layer two so everyone can transact cheaply at the cost of slightly reduced security.
It's the best from both worlds.
You will have a choice between high cost, high security or low cost with less security but faster.
Are you against having a choice?
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:22:27
If they do that, their chain might become minority chain though and could get wiped out.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:45:03
the point for me and probably many others to support BIP148 is not to actually have to go through but to force either BIP141 activation or BIP91 being merged by segwit2x. So far it seems to have a significant effect in that regard and if BIP148 gets enough support it would be safe, even if miners or Jeff refuse to do the sane thing.
It's a catch 22 or actually a Byzantine Generals problem. BIP148 is perfectly safe if it has enough support but risky if not. That's why you and many other oppose it. Making it risky und unsafe in the process...
I've been arguing with u/luke-jr against BIP148 myself, but a big part of the industry threatening to fork off is more damaging than BIP148 in my opinion. At least if they go through with it and at this point I consider the chance of it happening high enough to support BIP148 myself.
What I don't understand is why people like you not just state: "I'm willing to support BIP148 if it gets enough support from relevant actors" instead of outright opposing it?!
Or do you consider it unsafe even with big majority support?
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:49:29

you do realize though, that signing a message or move some coins from blocks associated with satoshi doesn't proof anything besides having control of those keys (long enough to fulfill the task).
actually not even that. maybe that person is just able to convince someone else, who controls the keys, to do the task for him.
that's it. it might be a hint, that there are close ties to satoshi, it might be even satoshi himself. but it's evenly likely, it's just satoshis grand cousin who discovered an USB stick with the keys in satoshi's estate.
so maybe be a bit more careful, before you call something "proof".
bitcoins can do a lot of things, but proofing identity is certainly not part of it!
especially since satoshi most likely wasn't just one person.

I don't disagree with you at all. I'm just saying that the _perceived_ chain split risks of BIP148 will prevent it from gaining enough support.
It doesn't matter that miners would have to go along with the economic supermajority.
BIP148 will simply never reach that. Please stop being delusional.
Not a single exchange has voiced support.
I hope BIP149 and/or BIP9 can save the day. Unfortunately I didn't voice my concerns in time at the right places or nobody cared to listen. If we would've started with BIP149/9 right away, segwit activation would be much, much closer already.
We are wasting a lot of time with BIP148
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:05:40
Thanks for the quick reply. I have to make sure to finish editing before submitting next time.


Not if a majority of hashrate is on board. If BIP148 has enough support and it's obvious, miners will have no choice. That means supporting it, makes it safer while opposing it makes it more risky.


I get that you and many others don't think its an issue at all, when pretty much the whole industry creates a competing Bitcoin. I'm not sure if you're just ignorant regarding the following chaos and confusion or seriously think the market will consider it an altcoin. I predict it will be messy and a lot of trust will be lost, setting us back at least 5 years, destroying every last bit of first mover advantage in the process and possibly even bitcoins store of value proposition.
Here the question I added in my first post before I realized that you replied already:




@_date: 2017-05-18 11:19:09
which minority? bitcoin works just fine if you pay 200-300 sat/byte as always.
I agree, cheaper fees would be nice but it's probably never going to happen, no matter what.
we need segwit and LN to be able to transact small amounts with feasible fees... no reasonable blocksize hard fork will ever solve this problem for longer than a few weeks, maybe months.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:28:22
nope, I thought the same way (and would've preferred waiting for BIP149), until Barry came around and started trying to force a contentious hard fork on us.
That's why there is no choice left but to support BIP148 and hopefully get enough support in time, to avoid a split altogether!
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:57:15

@_date: 2017-05-29 15:29:08
I don't understand. Can you elaborate?
Isn't this doubling the block size to 8MB in a worst case scenario with segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:44:02
If there is _not_ enough support before August 1st to avoid a split altogether there is only one single metric necessary to determine the UASFs fate: **The price**!
If Segwit coins trade at a significantly higher price than legacy coins, the legacy chain has basically no survival chance and the miners have to either hardfork (and thereby switch to an altcoin) or their chain will get annihilated.
Since everyone know this, it should happen fairly quick!
The whole situation will get messy, if segwit coins trade at a discount without surpassing the price of the legacy coins within hours or days (max).
In that case the UASF is in trouble. 
That's why we need a fair futures marked with decent liquidity. 
From the evidence available right now, it seems like segwit coins will be much more valuable and there won't even be a split. At least not for longer than minutes or hours.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:03:04

I don't really disagree with anything you say. Screaming at people and telling them they can fuck off usually doesn't really help in getting them to cooperate though. Which is kind of the point of my post.
Besides, weather you like it or not, the industry are users as well and any bitcoin business with some traction certainly has more weight than Joe Random with his lone BIP148 node.
It's not like all the users have switched over already (unfortunately) ...
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:06:32

Doing nothing while the biggest miner holds the network hostage and while the whole industry pledges support to a contentious hard fork sounds pretty wrong to me.
If BIP148 gets enough support, miners will activate segwit via BIP9 anyway.
The support is what matters! Not the amount of time!

UASF forces segwit, which evidently everyone wants besides Jihan. And even he stopped opposing it, since he realized it would isolate him from everyone else.

you don't understand bitcoin at all. 
businesses are regulated entities. If it becomes impossible to run a node for very cheap from your home connection, bitcoin is not much better than paypal. It is very easy to regulate businesses and a handfull of miners in a way to only allow them to broadcast/mine government/law enforcement approved transactions.
but cheap and from at home is not enough! you need to be able tun run your node behind tor, otherwise banning bitcoin on a nation state level becomes very easy for oppressive governments.
the reason that people can safely use SPV is **ONLY** because everyone could in theory still fire up a full node.
the moment that isn't possible anymore, SPV will not be good enough.

there are 50k-100k nodes out there that are already not relaying blocks anymore, since the bandwidth requirements of today's 1MB blocks forced them to stop relaying at all:
that's why the remaining 7k-10k nodes need to relay each block much more than just 1 or 2 times.
this ratio will only get worse with growing block size!

nope, it would not be enough, because it doesn't enable layer 2 and further on chain scaling like schnorr signatures.
segwit does both end therefore brings roughly 2-3 times on chain scaling plus 1000x with lightning.

That is wrong! I use bitcoin 24/7 365 days a year to protect my wealth. Millions are doing the same. None of us is transacting more than a couple times per year but we are all using bitcoin.


That is correct. Segwit and LN as is can't support unlimited amounts of users but it can support an unlimited amount of transactions.
40-100 million users is a pretty good next step!
The internet wasn't scaled to billions and HD video transfer in one step either.

it's certainly better than a HF because a soft fork will never be a hard fork, mo matter how much you're trying to twist the facts. worst case it will be a long lasting split but if price is lower on the segwit side, the UASF fails and we misjudged support. if the price is higher, the old chain dies. in anyway it will not be a permanent split like a HF.
since the risks are so high, I actually argued vehemently against the way BIP148 is implemented. but unfortunately too many people in the economy are taking crazy pills and trying to force unacceptable proposals on the users to keep stalling progress.
so by now I consider the risk of waiting another year as bigger than the risks of a controversial UASF

you are missing nothing. it's pretty frightening. Hence the "bitcoin is already broken with 1MB blocks."
to be clear, blocks would still propagate without fibre! but much, much slower with insane orphaning rates which would quickly lead to 100% of hashrate in one pool or one geographical area (most likely behind the great firewall of china).
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:21:25
nope. this would only happen, if segwit coins trade at a discount at which point the UASF has failed anyway and must be abandoned. 
If the major players like exchanges, miners, developers and co stay neutral, market has to decide. the decision will be quick, no matter what! 
alternatively there are still 2 months left for major players to make a firm commitment either pro or anti BIP148 to avoid a chain split altogether.

@_date: 2017-07-20 02:13:54
The Blue Matt [all by himself]( This is why Luke is right, when he says bitcoin is already broken with 1MB blocks.
The network wouldn't function anymore, if it weren't for somewhat centralized relay networks like fibre paid for by one single person.
Any sane block size adjustment would acknowledge these facts and could therefore only be a downsizing instead of a raise.
The blocksize increase of segwit itself is a bit of an exception since segwit brings many optimizations which hopefully offset most if not all the risks.
But anyone arguing for bigger blocks beyond what segwit brings without acknowledging the serious issues we have with 1MB blocks already is just very much intellectually dishonest. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:11:35
Adam is not a dev and calling Jeff a developer is a gross overstatement. He didn't even manage to [raise the blocksize]( in segwit8MB until someone else helped him out in the very last minutes before release.
On top of that, he is involved/owns two companies that try to make money by breaking bitcoin: 
Sorry, but I will keep calling him out!
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:34:27
well, if you try forking a 40 billion dollar network and are about to release your finale code in less than a week (after only a few weeks time to code, review and test) it's pretty telling what the priorities of that fork are when these changes are being done now. It seems that this is the most important thing for them right now.
So people are actually doing exactly what you demand: judging SegWit8MB on its own merits.

oh man.... in case you haven't noticed, BIP9 will be retired. segwit was the last softfork ever that relied on miners being cooperative.

They sure as hell refuse to answer mine from July 3rd:








(see below).




* my orders have repeatedly not been put into the book. Trading happened for many minutes at times without my limit sell order below spot price being touched.
* even market orders were not filled repeatedly and were sitting untouched for way longer than 3 minutes before I canceled them and resubmitted.
* I get repeatedly error messages a la "the submitted form has expired" - this is ridiculous!
* the trading interface and active orders need to be on one screen (1280x800) and no need to click through multiple screens and instances.
bitfinex &amp; OKCoin have good interfaces which is why I'm having 3-5 times as much volume there even though I don't consider them as trustworthy as kraken.






xxx xxx
**some more issues:**
* requiring confirmation for orders other than obviously wrong ones is super annoying
* trading interface is insanely slow. even more so during high volume
* kraken never shows how many funds are available or locked up in orders.
* no sell all or buy all buttons (super annoying)
* doesn't show current € equivalent balance
none of the other major exchanges has a single one of these issues.
kraken suxxxx! big time! sorry to be blunt!

@_date: 2017-07-26 23:49:02
I think you are right. Segwit appeared out of thin air. It basically developed itself and just materialized.
Then the heroic miners went into a big fight for us, the users, risking their lifes only to activate it. They did so much for us! We should be truly thankful.
I see the light now. I was very confused. Thanks for not giving up on me!
Absolute magic, how segwit and all the other improvements and even bitcoin itself developed itself magically. Just by the miners being there for us and activating all the stuff!
What a fool I was to think the developers had anything to do with it!
Hail the miners!

@_date: 2017-07-14 22:19:56
you never know, for sure from which IP a transaction originated. The better your node is connected, the better you can guess though.
The whole idea of companies like Skry is to fuck people over even though they tried to keep their privacy. There are endless strategies and techniques. A very well connected node certainly helps.
Nobody said it's all you need.
But at the end of the day the question is, do you want a diverse and decentralized developer team with years of experience and the best for bitcoiners at heart or do you want one guy who owns AML/KYC and spying companies which sole purpose is to break bitcoins last bit of fungibility.
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:56:41


that's not true at all! Segwit is very honest and tells every node that a new softfork was deployed and they need to update to be able to see all the data!
besides, the bar is set very high with segwit/BIP141. it will only be deployed with 95% of miners signaling or maybe via BIP149 when more than 90% of nodes already upgraded. 
Segwit8MB plans to force a hardfrok on everyone without even a majority of users and companies behind it. Let alone nodes...
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:27:07
Even Roger Vers very own site tells you the opposite:


@_date: 2017-07-15 03:47:08
thats nonsense!  this transaction can't be mined. It's invalid. It was already discussed on the btc1 github and considered a non solution:


@_date: 2017-07-14 14:54:08
tell that to all the BTC-e users who lost funds after the fork. Or coinbase, who had to reimburse their users.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:15:42
The problem is, that the absolut maximum anyone can get out of gox is the dollar equivalent of their share of coins at ~480$
If the price rises any further you will get less and less bitcoins, if they ever start paying them out.
any surplus will go to shareholders, not creditors.

unfortunately coin.dance is completely useless in that regard since their grid view doesn't distinguish between NYA support and actual BIP91 signaling.

He has been spreading lies repeatedly. I tried to talk to him in private and asked for clarification, first he just refused to acknowledge the facts I confronted him with and then refused to answer all together but kept repeating his lies on Twitter (that core is part of segwit8MB and helps via github and the mailing list)
I started calling him out in public after.
He still refuses to acknowledge that his statements are false and doesn't retract them. Which makes them plain lies.
He keeps pushing for a contentious fork, threatens mine and every hodlers wealth and keeps spreading disinformation and outright lies.

@_date: 2017-05-23 07:18:36
It's completely meaningless what miners like or consider. What matters is the market price of segwit coins vs. Non segwit coins.
If segwit coins are valued higher, hash rate will shift and the old chain gets wiped out. Pretty terrifying for anyone betting on the old chain.

It is of course unfortunate that some small blockers may capitalize on this incident as a way to ostracize Gavin. And it may indeed be true that some Core / Blockstream devs have been looking for an excuse to lock Gavin out.
But still, Gavin brought this on himself. He could have remained skeptical (or simply un-involved, like Andreas). Instead, for whatever mysterious reason, he participated in this bizarre spectacle. Who knows why.
But nobody deserves our automatic support and trust. That has to be earned. And right now, Gavin has thrown that all out the window."
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:30:30


seems like you have no idea, in what kind of ventures Jeff is involved:
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:09:41
very simple: the larger the pool, the lower the orphane rate. the smaller, the higher. 
this means huge pressure to larger and larger pools
if you controll 30% of the haspower, chances are 30% that you'll find the next block as well in which case you have 0 orphaning risk. this is true for 50, 70, 90 and 100% as well obviously.
a 1% pool has a 99% chance that someone else is going to find the next block, hence a much higher orphaning risk.
it can be somewhat mitigated with empty blocks. That's why we still see empty blocks all the time. But it's not a very good solution for obvious reasons...
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:49:52
Here is the hard data which proves that SegWit8MB indeed has consensus: 
**Consensus for being rejected**. Every person who truly matters in this debate is in strong and fundamental opposition.
you asked for hard data. I provided it many times over. Why do you [keep asking]( and implicitly pretending it doesn't exist?
Or is it just y'all have no clue what consensus really means? Like [Alex Petrov](


No Alex, this is **NOT** what consensus means!
so much cringe! It gets worse and worse, the more I read...
Like this gem from [Tom Zander]( (Bitcoin Classic lead dev):


I truly wonder how one should deal with people who are refusing to acknowledge basic facts and even reality altogether while simultaneously been given the power to truly disrupt or even threaten the very existence of bitcoin by basically all miners and large parts of the industry?!
I wish I had an answer...
Ignore them and change PoW?!
Bitcoin Error Log [sums it up]( pretty good:


For anyone interested, here are some links regarding consensus. What it is and how it is achieved:
How things should be done, as opposed to how SegWit8MB is doing it:
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:20:35
just because SPV security is broken and they have no way to check the blocksize doesn't mean the rules don't change for them.
Just because you're blind and can't read a new law, doesn't mean it hasn't changed for you.
That's the whole point of the hardfork bit: Tell SPV clients, the rules have changed so they can decide which chain they wanna use. If you don't do that they might end up flip flopping between both in case there is no clear hashpower majority on either chain.
It's absolutely insane to force users into this mess!
If you wanna fork contentiously and without consensus, at least minimize the damage and leave peacefully!
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:24:29

@_date: 2017-07-16 19:25:55
Every hardfork severely hurts the store of value proposition since it doubles supply. Store of value is the most important proposition besides decentralization, for bitcoin to truly have a meaningful impact and actually help to build a better world.
In my opinion any hardfork with less than 99% support is an attack on bitcoin if the 1% have good technical and scientifically sound arguments against it.

1 on 1! you can double your coins at no cost!

regarding 2MB - of course it would still work with centralized relay networks. We should strife to make bitcoin less broken, not more though. But since the fork is not going to happen anyway it doesn't matter for now.

mempool is empty and segwit isn't even activated. so no, a blocksize increase is definitely not needed at this point in time.
lightning will likely raise capacity by another factor of 100 or even 1000.

When Airbus asks it's engineers to quadruple their biggest airplane and the engineers say, they can only safely double the capacity and rather quit (every. single. one. of. them) than put their name on that project, the management should listen.
I'd call that complete lack of support. actually consensus against it even!
The CEO has two options available: listen to the experienced engineers and just double the capacity or fire them all and give the job to some interns and a few freshly hired car engineers who are eager to make a name for themself.
btc1 has chosen the latter approach. 
indeed. time will tell.

a node only makes sense if you use it to validate your own transactions. If you use bitcoin you have transactions. even if you're just a hodler since every coin you buy needs to be transacted to your wallet and therefore validated.
If you want to support the network, run the node as a listening node and consider not pruning it.

everyone is aware of this fact and it is a major problem. far more pressing than any scaling issues. That's why the many things that are being developed to get better privacy and fungibility (schnorr signatures, tumble bit, mimblewimble and even lightning, etc...) need to be implemented ASAP, before the protocol solidifies even more or all together.
If nation states get their way, and the scenario you are describing won't be reverted, bitcoin will fail.

you've got a point there, I have to admit. Unfortunately you're proving me right moments later:




since you think those are opposing statements you're definitely a bit confused, to say the least.
people can safely use SPV because everyone could in theory still fire up a full node since running "a node for very cheap from your home connection" is possible.


it's already very difficult/impossible to run a well connected full node at any place on the planet without limiting the bandwidth usage and you are proposing to raise the bandwidth requirements 128-2000 fold?! 
sorry, but your numbers are completely bullshit. full nodes have to **relay** blocks as well, not only download them, to keep the network up and running.
people are reporting 20-100GB upload usage **per day** since years already and you want to multiply that by 2000?
even considering 128 fold just a distinct possibility is absolutely delusional. anyone claiming that should stop posting nonsense about how to scale bitcoin immediately! Even most miners who stand to gain the most from bigger blocks are mostly opposing anything beyond 8MB

it is more dangerous as soon as it becomes part of bitcoin. as long as stuff like this is kept outside without exception, authorities only have the choice to either ban bitcoin altogether or leave it be. as soon as control mechanisms become part of bitcoin itself, the story changes.

maybe you should start with looking up the fees of western union and m-pesa. those are the transfer systems people in the developing world can actually use. M-pesa is pretty popular despite its exorbitant higher fees than bitcoin. ([10c]( to transfere one dollar for example, but 85c (!!!) already for the [average transaction]( size of 75$)
bitcoin might become relevant in that area one day, when mass adoption is already reached and prize becomes stable. but it isn't of any use for people who are struggling to get through the day, as long as we have huge volatility.
how can fees of a few percent (at worst) matter the slightest as long as price can change by more than 10 times as much percentage wise within minutes?

@_date: 2016-07-19 05:41:37
I think you are misunderstanding the purpose of the mining chip.
It was integrated to give the device the ability to participate in the machine payable web precisely without the need to go through the hassle of buying coins.
That's the main purpose and that's why it probably made more sense to use an older (cheaper) chip, than a competitive (but more expensive) one.
It was never the Idea to generate revenue with mining. The chip is mainly a door opener to join the network. Revenue can be made by selling data or the data bought from others is in itself worth the money and might generate a revenue elsewhere.
21.co is not trying to be a mining pool/company, they are trying to enable machines to communicate without human interaction. For that to be true on all levels, the mining chip is necessary.

@_date: 2016-07-19 06:50:30
do you mean


there is a simple reason: segwit gives roughly the same capacity increase as a 2MB HF without the drawbacks of the latter. In fact it has many more optimizations.
You don't build 4 lanes now if it comes at a high cost when 2 lanes are sufficient. You can always build more lanes at a later time when smarter ways of handling the traffic turn out to not be sufficient. 
there is no easy way of getting rid of excessive lanes and their associated cost though.
so going step by step is the safer and more reasonable way to do it.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:28:10

yep. that is imho the _only_ valid argument so raise the blocksize. It is moot though if better scaling solutions like schnorr signatures, compact blocks, etc. are able to scale significantly onchain without threatening decentralization.  
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:55:01
it [happened]( already. [apparently]( by accident.
My guess is, it doesn't happen (at least not in an obviously damaging  way) due to some game theoretical reasons. miners might be worried that doing so will only yield them a benefit in the short term but could end up more costly in the long term?!

Bitcoin is NOT a religion and the white paper is NOT the holy scripture.
Interesting though, that the ones conflating it with the holy scripture are always the ones who totally ignore everything that doesn't fit their narrative:
- where is pooled mining in the white paper?
- where are ASICs in the white paper?
- where are non mining nodes in the white paper?
korrekt. they don't exist. because Satoshi didn't anticipate any of that. In his "vision" nodes were always mining and would therefore be compensated. Since that is not the network we have today there are only two options: find a way to incentivise and pay node operators for the service they are providing or keep the cost of running a node as low as possible.
Or do you think we should rely on altruism, when making design decisions for bitcoin?
Bitcoin would be dead already if the core developers were dumb enough to do this and other things uninformed users are demanding.
Running the bitcoin network is costly and the ones bearing that cost need to be compensated, otherwise it is NOT sustainable in the long run.
Right now the incentives are broken, since node operators get nothing and miners get too much. We have to find ways to get it back in balance **instead of making it worse**!

You are the one being confused. Read the posts on the mailing list. They don't want to use the HF bit specifically because bitmain demanded wipeout protection which can only be guaranteed by mining a &gt;1MB block.
They refuse to set the hardfork bit because, as [Jeff Garzik]( says:


in-the-field wallets.
I realized that my title is indeed a bit confused. Added a clarification in the parent post.
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:51:20
This article was posted here before but was downvoted into oblivion.
The article is pretty good but could arguably made a better case for why bigger blocks threaten decentralization.
As far as I know, the main issue ~~isn't~~ *isn't only* the relay latency that bigger blocks cause for miners. They are using the fast relay network anyway and therefore ~~aren't affected~~ *have a "work around"*. 
The issue with bigger blocks is the growing resource requirements for full nodes.
Full node count has dropped from more than 20,000 at the time Gavin had his [talk to the CIA]( to around 5,500 nodes over the last couple of months.
Roger Ver's and other big blockers main argument for raising the block size goes more or less like this: "more capacity, more users, more full nodes, more decentralization".
Unfortunately reality proves them wrong. We had tremendous growth and probably millions of new users since Gavins infamous talk, yet the node count dropped  by a staggering 70-80%.
That is the main argument against raising the block size: Decentralization is already very problematic. We _can not_ take any steps which would threaten it even more.
Since Decentralization is paramount and without it, bitcoin is worth nothing, compromises have to be made elsewhere.
another minor point: 
the analogy for going 200 miles instead of taking a plane isn't the best one. adding endless lanes to the highway would be a more appropriate comparison and shows how obviously flawed the big block approach is.
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:50:16

The only one in your list that is security relevant is the 10 minute block interval target.
There is a lengthy explanation from Satoshi why he decided to go for 10 minutes. He took lot's of though into this one. As is true for any security relevant parameter.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:22:04
Long story short, the community had a problem. Congestion became a bigger and bigger issue, an elegant scaling solution was available and ready to activate, but Bitmain (who are rumored to control 30 or even up to 70% of the global hashing power) could easily block it indefinitely as long as they controled at least 5-10% of the hash power. Meanwhile reaping the ever rising mining fees (millions of USD per week).
That's when the idea of a User Activated Softfork (UASF) was proposed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list: 
The anonymous developer, using the handle shaolinfry, later submitted this new activation mechanism via so called Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to the open source bitcoin code repository on GitHub. Specifically BIP148 and 149. Both of them would allow users of the bitcoin network to activate segwit without miners being able to block the upgrade by just using a flag day after which non-segwit signaling blocks would be rejected as invalid.
Users, being fed up with Bitmains stalling tactics and ever rising fees rallied behind BIP148 which would activate segwit on August 1st this year, much faster than BIP149. Unfortunately the fast activation comes at a cost: a much bigger risk of a network split. If more than 50% of the hash power refuses to signal for BIP148 prior to August 1st a split would be all but guaranteed. The old legacy chain would stay alive, unchanged, while the new BIP148 chain would have segwit with all it's benefits. Every user would have as many bitcoins as before but on both chains. 
Everyone could make a choice: Wait and see or sell their coins on one chain to buy more on the other, possibly giving the updated chain a higher value than the legacy chain.
Since segwit is backwards compatible even the nodes on the legacy chain would consider the BIP148 chain valid and switch over the moment it becomes longer due to more and more hash power mining on it. It is assumed that the coins generated on the segwit activated BIP148 chain would have a higher market value than non segwit coins, thereby incentivising miners to switch over. If enough miners actually did switch over, the BIP148 chain would become longer and longer, eventually wiping out the legacy chain. Possibly destroying millions and millions USD worth of coins mined on that chain.
Those are the (incomplete and simplified) game theoretical assumptions driving BIP148 supporters and threatening miners and everyone else who decides to stay on the legacy chain. If enough users are worried to lose their coins on the legacy chain it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
After BIP148/UASF gained more and more support the bitcoin industry and the miners, representing more than 80% of the global hash rate, came together and signed an agreement in New York to activate segwit before August 1st and hard fork later this year to double the block size once more. It's a bit of a dirty compromise because many oppose the hard fork part, but since nobody can be forced to actually go through with the hard fork, it doesn't really matter as long as segwit gets activated.
The segwit activation part of the agreement is specifically designed to happen before August 1st, which makes it compatible with BIP148 and avoids a split as long as the tight schedule is honored: 
Many will argue that the New York Agreement made segwit possible by combining it with a hard fork to appease the big blockers. When looking behind the curtain it becomes obvious though, that it's the threat of BIP148/UASF that forced everyone, including Bitmain, to give up the opposition to segwit.
It becomes especially obvious if we look at litecoin! When segwit was ported to litecoin, Bitmain, who also controls a large part of the litecoin hash power opposed it there as well. It was only after the users got fed up and threatened a UASF that the miners got together and agreed to activate segwit quickly which subsequently sparked the biggest price hike in litecoins history: 
The same happened to at least one more coin. Will update, once i found out which.

I learned about bitcoin around May 2011 in the very first article ever published about it on spiegel.de - one of the most popular online news providers in Germany:
"Hacker currency bitcoin - Money out of the power outlet"
google translate version:
The article is really good, very well researched and already talks about the revolutionary potential of bitcoin.
After reading, I knew right away that this will be big and I should get some.
Unfortunately it was already too late to mine them with consumer hardware but still hideously difficult to buy them. There was some weird scheme where you had to wire money to Japan via some dodgy payment provider in France to be able to buy on MtGox.
Only much later, in August 2012 I actually started buying on bitcoin.de for 8€ after the crash of the pirate40 bubble. Was selling concert tickets on the grey market at the time and had to move my money off a bank account without revealing my name. (Decided to reveal all the transfers to the tax man a bit later because the few € saved tax wasn't worth the worry). Back then I was pretty pissed, that I missed out during the long time when they were trading around 4€.

just because 90% of hashrate is signaling for S2X right now doesn't mean they are going to go through with the hard fork! Imagine 70-90% of nodes sticking with core. I'd assume at least some miners will change their mind.
If not, we can always change the PoW if necessary.

@_date: 2017-06-27 05:23:32
"Coincidentally" those 7 weeks were also by far the craziest for the whole crypto world with unprecedented trading volume, media hype and millions of newcomers.
Even in this most craziest time ever the worst that had happened was that people had to either wait a few hours or pay a few dollars to get their transactions confirmed quickly. (How many months does it take again, for a KK or PayPal transaction to settle? 3 months? never?!)
If most wallets were already as good as some of the best ones are becoming right now, it would've been even less of an issue.
Anyone telling me, transferring fiat in and out of exchanges or otherwise internationally is better compared to bitcoin even at it's worst congestion times seriously needs a reality check! 
So why exactly do we need to double the block size twice with a risky and rushed hard fork instead of doing the sane thing: doubling it once (with segwit), get some real data and then reevaluate when and how much more capacity is needed and how can it be safely deployed without threatening the core values of the network!?
Source of the graph:  
This is by far the best source for proper fee estimation, btw!

how would have been the chances for the Saturn V to reach the moon, if von Braun and every single rocket engineer working on that rocket just left in an early stage after some moon mining company demanded it to have twice as much payload.
now imagine they took one of the Saturn V and just kept building it the safe way while the mining company hired some car engineers to double the size of theirs.

there is no base block size once you updated. there is only a new limit of 8MB and an average block size depending on usage.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:25:58


there is  a good chance that things play out like you said.
it's important to know, though, that segwit2x is trying to achieve two entirely unrelated things:
number one is to activate segwit (what basically everyone is waiting for since many months) and right now it seems they might accomplish this even before August 1st, which would prevent a chain split. If it happens, great news, bitcoin to the moon!
there is a catch though and here comes number two: they are also trying to force a hard fork on the community to double the block size once more (after segwit doubles it already), possibly as early as september 21st. right now there is no consensus for such a hard fork so there are a couple possible scenarios:
* They come up with some magically awesome code and everyone suddenly likes it, consensus will be reached and we hard fork without a chain split. (extremely unlikely)
* The matter stays contentious and some miners and some parts of the industry still decide to fork. It will depend if they have much more or much less than 50% support. in the former case there will be the original bitcoin plus a new corporate bitcoin. In the latter case, they will just create another shitcoin. (both outcomes are somewhat likely (maybe 5-25%).
* last but not least: the segwit2x hardfork code will be as shit as expected, majority of users refuses to upgrade their nodes and will just stick with core, more and more signers of the Barry Silber Accord will cite lack of community support and drop out of the agreement. We will have no hard fork and no split and sanity will have prevailed while Jihan and Roger will continue to spread FUD and lies about core and keep annoying everyone. (most likely outcome, probably 60-80%)
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:10:49
it translates to max 8MB. But as I said before:


@_date: 2017-06-17 01:12:56
it just got merged. hence the post. But it being merged is no guarantee that miners are actually signalling in time or even reach the threshold of 80% before it's too late.
actually there are rumors right now, that Jihan doesn't approve. 
so more BIP148 support would be better, to keep the pressure!

ASICBoost works by finding collisions in the hash function to fake work you actually haven't done.
Sure some people insist in calling it an optimization but that doesn't make it true. Being able to find collisions in hash functions is a vulnerability and using it to fake work is an attack. Plain and simple.
If you charge your employer for 8 hours of guarding his gate, but actually only guarded it for 6h and didn't let anyone through in the remaining 2 hours because you were sleeping, that's **NOT** an optimization, that's just cheating.

BIP148 activates a **backwards compatible** _soft fork_ which is tested like nothing has ever been tested before, production ready since many months and tested even more on countless altcoins.

Yes it can. Afaik it needs at least 15-25% hash power to successfully activate segwit before BIP141 retires in November. 
Besides, miners can activate segwit on the legacy chain any time. Thereby undermining the value of the BIP148 chain which has to wait for a long time to actually activate segwit if it has enough but low hashing power.

true. experienced developers are very much necessary, though. Unfortunately for you, they are all contributing to core, while not a single one is contributing to S2X.

**edit:** I just realized Vinny's tweet is from March, but now 3 months later, he still knows nothing: 
That's a steep learning curve! But to be fair, he doesn't need to know any of that. He just needs to leave it to the people who know!
What's even more crazy than Vinny suggesting how to tweak segwit to make it more "gracefully" though, is the lead developer, Jeff Garzik himself, proving that he has no idea about pretty much anything! **AND HE REALLY NEEDS TO FUCKING KNOW!**
Here is a completely [ridiculous analogy]( he made up to describe the fee market after segwit:


(kg).  This market now embarks on an opt-in transition to selling
automobiles based on engine size (cc's), a metric that automobile experts
agree better measures automobile ability.  Result:  Some bidders in the
market buy cars based on weight, others based on cc's.  How does one bid
efficiently in an always-in-transition market?   SegWit is not just a
technology upgrade, it is a market upgrade. 
That analogy is completely whack (updated users know they are bidding for more space, non-updated users know they still only have 1MB block space) and Jameson Lopp tells him as much in polite words:


transitions to all users bidding based upon weight. Users who are driving
old, heavy cars will now be incentivized to upgrade to more modern cars
manufactured with lightweight materials.
Instead of taking the critic, Jeff just doubles down.
But it gets much, much better! Jeff doesn't understand the segwit discount at all. He is knowledge wise basically on the same level as Vinny:






















Jameson Lopp has to correct him again:


versus creating outputs is terribly imbalanced and the discount is applied
in order to bring it more in balance. It can cost 5X-10X as much (data size
&amp; thus fees) to add an input (↓ UTXO set size) vs an output (↑ UTXO set
size) to a transaction. It could probably be argued that a 75% discount is
actually conservative in terms of trying to rebalance this discrepancy.


complexity that inputs can have. I think you'd need some kind of dynamic
weighting that would be much more complex and would require significant
development resources to implement. I don't think we should let perfect be
the enemy of good given the timeline of this project.
And Jeff doubles down. **AIGAIN**


arbitrary]   :)
That is another ridiculous statement. **That is not what Jameson says.** He is talking about two different things and Jeff just doesn't get it.
Welcome to the brave new Bitcoin they are building for us! 
I'd say, everyone should stay as far away from the segwit2x hard fork as possible. Let them activate segwit now but don't join their new altcoin in 6 months!

it's a new limit at 8MB and an average expected block size of ~4,4MB (could become quite a bit more, depending on future usage) so I'd say 4-8 is more accurate. unfortunately the 140 character limit of twitter doesn't allow for a more nuanced description.

fact is, nobody knows, what that "doubling" even means. so even if Jeff Garzik were capable of writing the code, he couldn't because nobody knows what the "agreement" even is about. it's pretty disingenuous to even call it an agreement, considering this fact.

another gem by the glorious Jeff:




That's complete and utter nonsense again. First of all even the signature part of the block is not free and second the "Garbage Risk" is pretty bad right now and actually gets much better with segwit.
Jameson Lopp, has to explain it to Jeff. **AGAIN**:


Risk we have today is pretty bad due to the imbalance in cost of spending
inputs vs creating outputs. As it stands today, we have entities creating
transactions with hundreds and hundreds of tiny value outputs on a regular
basis because it's relatively cheap for them to do so - cloud mining is one
specific example I have personally seen. Then later, when the recipients of
these outputs try to spend them, they are greatly penalized due to the huge
size of their inputs. If such recipients are using SegWit, at least they
won't be paying disproportionately to spend their funds.


step in the right direction.

@_date: 2017-06-20 02:22:37
I assume you know the the basics of what is commonly called the scaling war In bitcoin? I'll quickly cover what I consider the major developments:
There are two sides in the bitcoin community generally referred to as big and small blockers where the former are not fundamentally opposed to bigger blocks but prefer to keep them small enough to not hurt decentralization (mainly measured via node count) even more while the latter argue raising the block size is a quick and easy way to scale and preserve bitcoins first mover advantage.
There were endless discussions about the issue and how to scale best since 2010 already but no proposal gained any significant traction.
Mid 2015 a contentious block size increase hard fork named Bitcoin XT was introduced and the question about weather or not to support it split the community. The vast majority of users and companies kept running the original bitcoin core client maintained by a team of 100+ so called core developers and contributors, while two developers, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn as well as maybe 5-25% of the users kept promoting Bitcoin XT (and subsequently a few more hard fork proposals).
In late 2015 an incredibly elegant solution was found that promised to make everyone happy: Segwit (short for Segregated Witness). It would double the block size to roughly 1.8-2.2MB, address many concerns of small blockers like the quadratic hashing problem and enable much more elegant implementations of second layer networks like lightning. All of this (and much, much more) via a backwards compatible **soft fork** which could avoid the risk of a network split entirely. A risk any regular block size increase via **hard fork** always bears.
It was basically a no-brainer, the prefect compromise! In the beginning it even looked like the two camps could be reunited. Everyone only hoped it would be ready soon.
As always, things took longer than expected and segwit was only released in late October 2016. Until then the hard fork preferring big blockers on r/btc had become pretty loud and vocal against segwit, denouncing it as too little, too late. Shortly after release the by far biggest producer of ASIC mining hardware, Bitmain Tech. suddenly started opposing segwit as well, citing lots of reasons that didn't really make too much sense.
Only much later things started to make sense again: prominent core developer Gregory Maxwell reverse engineered one of Bitmains ASICs and revealed a hidden function called covert ASICBoost, which could give Bitmain a significant and undetectable advantage under certain circumstances. It basically uses the same amount of electricity to fake significantly more hashing power via finding collisions in the hash function. Generally considered cheating or even an attack.
This unfair but undetectable advantage would be lost when mining the new segwit blocks due to the way segwit has to be implemented in a soft fork. Only the detectable but patent protected overt ASICBoost would still be possible.
A lot of people consider this the main reason why Bitmain vehemently opposed any covert ASICBoost breaking soft forks while promoting hard forks or other scaling proposals that didn't.

I'm happy to take their offer to activate segwit but sure as hell will oppose the hard fork if it isn't for some reason magically awesome code and independent measurements plus the core devs confirm that it is OK and should be done.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:13:52


that's true. but if the community &amp; core opposes the code, it won't be merged. simple as that.
that way segwit2x will turn out to be a way for Jihan &amp; co to save face but still activate segwit.
they can later bitch all they want if the hard fork never happens.

Ok. here is the deal: if S2X is traded as Bitcoin with the ticker BTC on at least 60% of the top [volume exchanges]( on september 21st. you win and get my 1 BTC
if not, I win. Agree? 
We can pick one of the most trusted escrows from bitcointalk, to take 1 BTC each into escrow until the bet resolves.

I disagree. Time will tell, who is right. Who in their right mind would keep paying expensive fees, if they can get it 75% cheaper with a simple update?
Besides mining pools, exchanges and payment providers are the ones making the vast amount of transactions and suffering the most.
You are naive if you think they don't update right away.

If you use copay, which belongs to BitPay you might lose all your coins, if BIP148 is successful.
BitPay seems to be Jihan's sockpuppet since he gave them a lot of money and Jihan doesn't particularly like UASF/BIP148. in fact he said he will hard fork to his own Jihan coin in case BIP148 gets any traction and anyone doing business with him or his sockpuppets (Bitpay, Purse, etc...) will end up on his chain and might lose everything but Jihan coins.

it means that if this modification gets merged **and** Jeff releases segwit2x code no later than 21st of july **and** miners start signaling right away to reach 80% quickly segwit will be locked in before August 1st and all the currently existing segwit ready nodes (including BIP148) will stay on one chain.
so no split!

@_date: 2017-06-28 22:22:43
Bitcoin is valuable despite not being a currency yet. Even though it's not a currency yet, people have to go through a lot of pain to use it as such because there is nothing else they could use instead.
So the argument that bitcoin will lose it's value by stopping to be something it has never been in the first place makes no sense.
You could argue that it might become even more valuable, if it becomes a currency but you could also argue, it might become less valuable in that case. For example when the store of value propositions is being traded for better currency attributes (cheaper transactions, but less secure, for example).
PayPal is awesome as a digital currency. Pretty useless for anything else than paying stuff on the internet. Why would you wann focus on competing with that when there are so many more interesting and important things to focus on?!

households always turn on the lights and utilities when demand is high and shut them off, when capacity is abundant. Like clockwork. The absolute opposite of elastic!
Modern Bitcoin miners automatically adjust electricity consumption and efficiency according to global hashrate:


It's safe to assume that mining operators already use this feature to optimize mining efficiency according to electricity price/supply.
So I guess you are wrong and u/Tulip-Stefan is right.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:39:53
yep. if segwit could offer 20MB but wouldn't be safe anymore, it would be deliberately designed to offer less.
since it is within the safe margin, no need to deliberately aim at anything.
but yeah, "2MB are OK, thats why segwit can offer around 2MB" might have been a better formulation, if you want to be pedantic...

Just trying to gauge demand for the moment.
Open to sell up to 10 S2X for now. If there are potential buyers, we'd need a trustworthy escrow and settle on the conditions.
Can think of 4 different kind of contracts:
* 1) If had fork happens before September 30th I get my BTC, you get your S2X right after the split.
If hard fork doesn't happen, or it happens but no split occurs (S2X becomes BTC) both get their coins back.
* 2) If had fork happens before September 30th I get my BTC, you get your S2X right after the split.
If hard fork doesn't happen, I get everything.
If hard fork happens but no split occurs (S2X becomes BTC) you get everything
* 3) Same as 1 but delivery December 31st
* 4) Same as 2 but delivery December 31st
I'm interested in feedback regarding the contract details. Open to negotiate.
Anyone interested and if yes, what price do you offer?

which part of "there is only one block size limit after you upgrade" is it, that you fail to grasp?
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:26:57


you do realize though, that "therefore" relates to the point in time, when the work with segwit is completed (when it's merged into a core release)? Therefore July only was a rough estimate and has long been invalidated due to segwit being merged later than initially expected/hoped for.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:49:13
it's still early days - there will be much bigger wars in the years to come. 
for now, hopefully sanity will prevail and segwit gets activated before August 1st. the miners are the ones who have the most to lose by far. Since they are also the ones who can activate segwit anytime, I'd assume it will happen.
If not, there is still a chance that the industry and enough miners rally behind BIP148 to make it a smooth non event.
Only if both scenarios fail it will get interesting. But even then there is a reasonable high chance, BIP148 will win (or fail) very quickly.
So I personally think the likelihood of a messy long lasting chain-split is less than 25% - just too much to lose for everyone.

you don't understand how segwit works. it was specifically designed to avoid anything bigger than 4mb, no matter what. segwit2x raises that to 8mb. period. if you wanna limit that to 4mb you have to discard segwit2x and just do segwit. which, btw, would be the sane thing to do anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:25:25
Another noteworthy [post]( from u/nullc in regards to the NY agreement (it's worth while to read the whole [thread]( btw):
Well, a hasty snapshot of a few of my views, others my [sic] differ ([though opposition to that "agreement" looks like it may be unamious](
* It was unethically conducted: A VC created a private and closed meeting with his investments in the Bitcoin space and a few others without public input; and they made an agreement to forcefully change the rules of Bitcoin. Hello Etherum Foundation (Ironic that the same person was the big driver on ethereum classic). They claim that "core devs" were "invited" but this is misleading enough to be an outright lie: We were asked to add our names to an already completed statement with a dozen other parties names already on it (so, so much for getting it to say something more sensible). It has been promoted with misleading claims of collaboration and support by Bitcoin Core folks, which are just untrue.
* It's unspecified. The actual signers of the agreement clearly disagree about what they actually agreed to. While "segwit+2mb" may sound like it means something to you-- it doesn't mean much. Under that banner you could do something fairly reasonable or something terrible [Fairly reasonable, for example would be to activate segwit, then with a reasonable timeframe hardfork to account for scriptSig data the same way that witness data is accounted for]. The details matter. Critically. Perhaps this was partially as a result of forming their agreement without a single participant with ANY experience in Bitcoin consensus rule design-- they didn't even know what you need to know about a protocol change.
* Its time-frame is extremely absurd. Actually, absurd doesn't do it justice which is why between that and number  several engineers have been just responding "LOL" to the proposal. They don't set any time for design review and analysis, they don't set any time for writing a specification (they don't have one and don't appear to intend to have one), they set aside two weeks for testing-- which is less time than even minor releases of Bitcoin get (and need!) even when they were comprised of small fixes which had mostly existed for months already. They don't allot any time for alternative implementations to implement it (which is especially bad because they can provide useful design feedback). They don't set aside time for meaningful deployment by users (some of whom may have their own lengthy patching and qualification process). They don't seem to have any concern about how forced upgrades erode decentralization and privileged hosted wallets/apis/pools over running your own infrastructure. Basically every stage of the consensus rule change pipeline should take (and always has taken) more time they allotted for everything. BU+Classic BIP109 ran on testnet for months before their interoperability failure was revealed and they forked apart from each other and abandon BIP109.
* They are explicitly rejecting and shielding themselves from public comment. E.g. they created a lf mailing list but when Luke-jr tried to join it Jeff replied saying the list was only for people who supported the agreement and intended to support it. Responses to requests to make their system compatible with BIP141 or BIP148 and existing nodes; have just been met with vague hand-waving about the "charter" and deleting comments on their github. This is doubly bad because some of their technical proposals just won't work and will self partition if deployed.
* It doesn't answer any of the serious concerns about the negative impact of increased capacity on the viability of the system, it just takes the capacity doubling of segwit (which is already seen by many as pretty extreme) and doubles it again. Some of the signers seemed to believe that what they agreed to was "segwit immediately" which at least would give some walk-before-running time but to the extent that I can figure out what they're doing, it isn't that. Keep in mind that segwit itself was a massive compromise-- taking on a large and risky increase in load, but countering it with scalability improvements... and as soon as it was proposed the goalpost moved. I doubt many see segwit2x as anything else.
* Bitcoin's value comes significantly from its durability against change. Bitcoin is fine the way it is-- it could be even better, but it doesn't need to make radical incompatible hasty changes. Everyone who wants cabal-controlled fork-a-week coins have several options to choose from. Bitcoin is never going to be better at being that than the cruddy altcoins which were designed for it (with huge premines to keep those early holders pumping through the waves of technical failure). In a competitive market we should look at what differentiates Bitcoin from the competition and exploit that as much as we can, not try to me-too follow around other things. If Barry and Co can rewrite Bitcoin's rules against non-trivial opposition who else can also do so?
* Bitcoin Core doesn't have the technical or moral authority to make incompatible changes to the rules of the network. And the dozens of major individual contributors just do not personally support this proposal (for some of the reasons above or others)-- and are obviously not going to volunteer their efforts to aid a proposal which they believe would harm Bitcoin. Probably this one would be the TLDR: Core isn't a company, it is an open public collaboration of many people. Core won't endorse pretty much anything but it certainly won't endorse things which are widely (or in this case nearly unanimously) opposed by its contributors.
None of the involved parties have showed even the slightest indication that they understood or cared about concerns like the above, even when people like Matt wasted hours trying to communicate them to them. Not a "I understand but we'll account for that by X"-- but just talking to a wall. Which means that its unlikely that the negative consequences of these concerns will be avoided with any reliability.
But finally-- what would be the point? I think that almost any one of these issues alone would make it dead on arrival. I'd say stick a fork in it, but Bitmain already has-- e.g. their post today says they have no intention on following through with segwit2x by saying they'd only activate segwit if it had more modifications (surprise, surprise).
The tech community was polite enough to keep most of our concerns in private and wait and see it this transformed into something supportable. But we've started speaking against it since the misleading claims that we supported and were collaborating with it started.

status quo is the best for the store of value/digital gold use case. If the protocol is unchangeable already, you don't have to worry about any future changes you might not like.

No I don't. I keep saying it is worthless and the fork shouldn't be done. SegWit8MB supporters tell me it's the opposite: Legacy chain will have no hashpower and will be pretty much useless, hence worthless.
If you would really think that, you would be more than happy to take my SegWit8MB coins for your legacy coins.
The fact that absolutely nobody takes that offer just shows that even the ones who are pushing for this fork don't think their chain will be anywhere near as valuable as the real bitcoins.
