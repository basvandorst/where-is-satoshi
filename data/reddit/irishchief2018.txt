I read an article recently that say Bitcoin has or will become a pyramid like scheme if all everyone does is HODL. 
In a pyramid scheme you only make money if more people buy in after you so in a world where the price of bitcoin rises and rises as it becomes scarcer or harder to buy as people HODL and don’t use it as a method of payment  does this mean those who HODL have created a pyramid scheme due to over hype on potential returns from investment ?
Does this also mean that that price is a series of bubbles that pop and inflate resulting in massive price swings like we see lately ? 
Interested to hear others thoughts on this .

I get that there’s people out there for whom 1 bitcoin is one bitcoin and the fiat value it trades at is irrelevant but for people buying in as an investment looking to make massive returns now it’s surely only going to end bad

I recently signed up to a class in college based around the history of Bitcoin and it’s potential future .
For the class I’ve to write an essay - it can literally be on anything to do with digital currencies.
Anyone any recommendations? Need to have good source material to read and preferably academic reference if ,
Cheers for any help !

Sorry I misspelled move as love in original post - but again the protection comes from human idea of trust and confidence . Trust the credit as it’s regulated by government for the benefit of society which can be viewed as a collective consensus on what’s best for people . So you trust your card as your confident if something goes wrong some regulatory body will right the wrong .

Question about mining - with regards to mining farms that have multiple mining machines does each machine have a set of public and private keys linked to it or is it possible to link multiple machines to one set of private and public keys ?
Where I’m confused is from what I know transactions are gathered up from the mem pool to form a block , miners add their public key to the block as the coin base then the machines try and find the nonce value - is each machines trying to find a value for one block or are they all trying to solve for multiple different blocks ?

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
August 2017 we saw the creation of a hard fork from Bitcoin’s original blockchain ledger. The fork was created as a result of a debate that caused a split into the bitcoin community. The debate was centered around the issue of scalability in the bitcoin blockchain . The following outlines below what I believe to be the arguments presented by both users of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash on how best to solve the scalability issue . Open to any corrections of details people may have on either sides arguments . 
The Issue of Scalability.
Under satoshis original whitepaper for Bitcoin we know that individual’s transactions are grouped together to form blocks. Each block has its own blockhash made up of four key components 
1)	The Hash of the previous block 
2)	A time stamp of the new block 
3)	The merkle tree root hash which is the method by which transaction are bundled together from the transaction slush pool  with the first transaction hash in the bunch being the coinbase of that bundle . 
4)	Nonce – This is the puzzle minors need to solve in order to complete the block . To solve the puzzle requires brut computing force so minors must expend computer processing power to find the value randomly that satisfies the puzzle. Upon finding the value the blocks hash is then complete and at this point the block is added to the blockchain .
When a block is added to the blockchain a miner ie the person whos cpu solved the nonce to create the block is rewarded in two ways – 1stly with the issue of newly minted bitcoin  and 2ndly with all the transaction fees that people wishing to send bitcoin transactions to attach to their transactions . 
The issue with scalability surrounding the blockchain prior to August 2017 was that each block could had a maximum blocksize of 1MB which allowed for roughly 250,000 transaction per day to be processed . The issue was that as more and more people began to use the Bitcoin network it began to run slower as users who were unwilling to pay higher fees had to wait longer for their transactions to be added from the slush to a block and confirmed . How to solve this issue of scalability in the blockchain is what ultimately lead to the forking of the blockchain in August 2017 and the creation of Bitcoin Cash .
Bitcoins solution to scalability – 
Bitcoins solution to its scalability issue include the creation of both Segregated Witness ( Segwit ) and lightning protocols. Segwit was introduced to increase the blockchain blocksize from 1mb to a maximum of 4mb with the current protocol allowing for blocks to be 2mbs in size . Segwit also allowed for the creation of layered networks on the bitcoin protocol that will ultimately lead into the adoption of the lightning network . 
The lightning network is a way in which payments can be chained together outside of the blockchain. It works by allowing participants to transactions interact only twice with the blockchain ledger , once to open and once to close a set of transaction . In-between the opening and closing participants enforce digital IOUs against one another with either party having the option to end the current transaction string of IOUs and cash out for the balancing amount . 
Bitcoin Cash’s Solution to scalability . 
Bitcoin Cash creators changed bitcoins protocol such that the block size was increased from 1Mb to 8MB thus allowing for more transactions to be confirmed in each block helping the network to run quicker . 
If you owned Bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017 you also own Bitcoin Cash ( I Think) . Because the chains forked I think so do the public and private key address in the underlying system which means if you sign into a wallet that supports bitcoin cash you’ll find some which at the time I wrote this was roughly 952 USD per coin . Is this correct? 
Thanks for all your feedback.

I’m not sure is the honest answer - I’m new the Bitcoin world but get the idea that the network is supposed to be decentralised and that the point is cutting out the need to use a trusted third party and if you have an agency to report these things to then it’s centralised .
I suppose it’s a philosophical kind of thing in terms of the classic code is law or the good of the human should triumph over the code like with the original DAO hack

I suppose in the end then it always does come down to the human element in the sense that consensus, value , trust , confidence are all

Interested in knowing where people stand on reversing transaction in the case of theft - read an article today about the rise of people who have their bitcoin stolen when they are kidnapped and tortured for their private keys or seeds .
If all technology is designed to make human life easier in some fashion then shouldn’t the human element of the system always come before the underlying tech ?

Do people ever think bitcoin wasn’t meant to be a mainstream currency - it’s something I’ve been thinking about lately . 
When you look at the background and the libertarian political views of many of the people ,who would be considered cypherpunks , involved in helping Satoshi write the bitcoin protocol is there an argument to be made that it was supposed to be a currency for those who wished to opt out of society and its current systems?
I suppose I’m essentially viewing it as a payment mechanism for those who wished to live outside the bounds of conventional society structures.

From what I know double spending isn’t prevented by transaction not being irreversible. Double spending is prevent by the network agree that ownership of a coin ( or part of one ) has been transferred from one public key to another. When a transaction is issued until it is confirmed in the Blockchain it stays in the mempool and you can’t send that coin again until it’s added to the Blockchain ( that’s my understanding kind of a newbie) so in my head double spending is prevented by the network consensus on who owns the coin based on who’s public key it was last seen at in the Blockchain with this coin only being accessed and sent onto someone else by the private key to that public key .
So what I’m imagining is some way that in circumstances that network participants allow transactions can be pulled from one public key and return to the previous one . Not sure how this would work or if it’s even possible.
Also transaction are reversible I think if one controls 51% of the network and does a Sybil attack . But if this happens then the network is devalued and the effort that goes into doing a 51% attack in terms of energy and computing power needed coupled with the devaluation of the network means it’s pointless to do so .

Guessing you’re a believer in Code is Law from the DAO Hack.
Question for you I’m wondering is where you would stand on if you were invested in bitcoin to make Fiat currency and then had your private key forcibly stollen and you lost money ? Is that just tough luck or if you were given the chance to reverse it would you ?

I suppose of Blockchains are viewed as a method of reaching consensus on ownership of something then you’d have to be able to get consensus to reverse transactions. 
Again I’m not sure about the whom and basis- I’d imagine people would say in the case of situations mentioned above and theft but maybe not in the case of carelessness of an individual.
If we take banks refunding customers who loose their debit/credit card and others run up transactions on it then they shouldn’t   be reversed as it was their fault but in the case of an individual who is mugged they should - but again the issue is how do you prove what happened. 
Do you have any ideas about the whom and on what basis ?

Help needed - As part of a college course I am doing I have been tasked with trying to explain what Bitcoin is in 500ish words. I've given it my best shot below - If you could read it and help me out with anything baring in mind word count I'd appreciate it a lot . 
(2) Your boss asks you to send them a short report on what Bitcoin is, what do you tell them?
According to its founder Satoshi Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that engages in disintermediation allowing users to send payments directly to each other without the use of a third party. Bitcoin is a system that removes the necessity of trusting a third party to process payments between individuals who wish to buy and sell goods online as well as providing them with the anonymity that cash purchases do in bricks and mortar commerce. The Bitcoin system replaces trust in a third party such as PayPal with the use computer technology such as a hash based proof-of-work system and cryptographic signatures.
Users of Bitcoin interact with eachother anonymously using cryptographic signature technology. If we take the example of Bob wishing to buy a product from Alice, Alice would provide Bob with her public key address to which Bob would send her an agreed amount of bitcoin from his public key address. Alice then decrypts any payment sent to her public address using her private key and at this point can send Bob’s bitcoin she received on to another person as she has proved by using her private key to decrypt the transaction that she is the rightful owner of the coin now. 
Alice may be worried that Bob has double spent his bitcoin by also sending it to another user but this issue is solved by the way in which transactions are confirmed by the Bitcoin system. When Bob sends payment to Alice this transaction is broadcast to computers connected to the system known as nodes. Nodes collect up the transactions and group them together into blocks. Each block has its own unique identifier know as a hash which is made up of three elements 
1)	The Hash of the previous block
2)	A Merkle Tree Root- Which allows for each transaction with its own individual unique has be grouped under one hash.  
3)	A Nonce – Which acts as a puzzle nodes seek to solve using computational power. Because each block is made up of transactions with individual unique IDs each nonce is a different unique value.
As each block’s hash begins with the previous blocks hash they form a sequential chain so that users of the system can confirm transactions based on their position in the chain. Blocks are added to the chain if 51% of all nodes in the system agree that the transactions within the block are legitimate ie the transaction are not double spending. Here Alice would be advised to wait for six blocks to form on the blockchain after her transaction has been confirmed as due to network latency transaction may be confirmed once within one block that is later be rejected by the network. 
Nodes in the system are rewarded for correctly forming blocks that are added to the chain with newly issued bitcoin and transaction fees users attach to the transaction they wish to send. In a situation where Bob wished to reverse his payment to Alice he we need to re-do the proof-of-work done by the other nodes in solving the nonces and have control over 51% of the nodes to approve his new block in a Sybil attack. For this situation to occur Bob would have to expand an extremely amount of large computational power incurring massive costs to do so as well as rendering all of his coin worthless as the entire system could no longer be trusted meaning nobody would use it. Therefore Bob is better off using his computational power to earn bitcoin to spend then devalue the entire system .

Thanks for the feedback - it’s a university module and I have been reading a lot of the academic material surrounding bitcoin it is perhaps to technical for someone with no knowledge.

New the Bitcoin world so just getting my head around it and was hoping someone could let me know if what im thinking is right. 
So based on the original whitepaper Bitcoin is a system of electronic cash that allows for peer to peer payments meaning we dont need paypal for example . Its my understanding that the way paypal works or any trusted third party payment provider works is like below 
In a normal situation where two people wish to send money to each other over the internet they use a trusted third party such as PayPal. The reason that they use a trusted third party is to ensure that the money being transferred is actually transferred and received. If we take the example of Alice sending money to Bob Paypal would credit Alices account of they money and then debit it to Bobs account. PayPal creates a record of this process ensuring the neither party can later claim that payment wasn’t sent or received. If PayPal didn’t exist Alice could tell Bob she issued payment without actually having done so or Bob could claim payment was never received. This allows for Alice to double spend the money she owes or for Bob to request double payment. PayPal acts as an intermediator to the transaction charging a fee for the service of providing payment transfer. 
With Bitcoin payments are peer to peer meaning no trusted third party is used. Instead of paypal confirming transactions and creating a record of payment and receipt this is all done in an automated way with transactions being grouped together to form blocks and blocks being linked together in a sequential chain that can only be added to and once added to cant be altered. 
Transactions are confirmed once a block has been created and added to the blockchain. For a block to be created people have to expended computational power looking to solve for a nonce value. The nonce value is a value that gives a blocks header a certain value but im not sure what this value is .
Could someone please explain what a nonce is and tell me if I am on the right track  in terms of paypal versus bitcoin?
