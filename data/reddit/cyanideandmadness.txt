Thanks, you've already given out more than I have in my changetip wallet so it cant be so bad :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:48:56
Nice, I did a few, I opened my first twitter acct to tip someone yesterday as well :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:03:58
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:16:18
I believe it applies to PayPal as well, as far as coverage
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:01:42
Did you tip him?
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:50:17
Sure, Thanks :)

Will do! TY. Not trying to get anybody fired, but she does need to be put in her place
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:49:21
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:54:23
Not sure if "props" was a tip. If it was it didn't work :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:31:21
Just follow the link my friend :)

You're awesome, Thank you :)

Thanks man that means a lot. I've deleted and unsubbed from all BTC related subs which sucks but I've never experienced such hate when all I asked for was support not tips. No offense but I think it's best if you keep it.

lol, honestly in my previous dealings with the principal it will most likely just be Ms. xxxx Mr. Madness is correct, his son is allowed to write on the subject you assigned, regardless of personal feelings, etc. But I will be prepared :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 02:40:06
As someone who just recently (maybe 9 days ago) started. Ty for this post. I try to read as much as I can, I'm trying to learn the ways. But a lot of users on here discourage me from asking questions or posting. I understand everyone should do their own research, but as a full time redditor who wants to be accepted by the community and even more so a sub in which I want to learn from, it'd be nice to know I can ask or post even the most rudimentary questions without being ridiculed.

Thank you
You're correct, I got caught up in the moment and meant the "crushing" part as a joke.
Calling me a "fucking asshole" in not very kind

@_date: 2014-11-18 22:50:24
ok, was just curious, live in IL, have not had the pleasure of finding a store to accept yet. Not much in Urbana...
@_date: 2014-11-04 03:11:13
Very kind! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:38:08
Lol, that was an answer that will help you. With the recent tipping ppl are being greedy and making multiple accounts to capitalize on tips
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:03:23
You're too kind Diapolis! TY
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:35:19

With two kids, the wife due with another on 12/25. Her not working, moving to a new place with higher rent, and my hours cut, that might as well be $1,000 or more but hey, at least I have almost $8.00 worth right? :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:23:14
definitely interested, Im still far off though :/
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:25:09

@_date: 2014-11-03 03:58:08
Yeah... that's not really cool and nobody is that stupid

@_date: 2014-12-04 23:04:23
Will do
@_date: 2014-11-04 03:00:13
Thats exactly how I feel. I was never into BTC, thought it would fade out, I was very wrong. I only got into it through the generosity of and now I'm hooked! I may not have much but I give what I can :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:04:28
Sorry. It says: "Incomplete! Unacceptable! Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme! If you want any credit you will need to re-write your speech on Ponzi schemes and how Bitcoin is involved."

I held a giveaway yesterday, it wasn't for much, but I too started to notice the accounts created "just now" and multiple users, kind of ignorant IMO no matter the amount

 TY, I am very Proud, and he says Thanks
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:48:49
Will do! And that's the thing too, this was just a rough draft of a speech he was going to give to the class and she's shutting him down before he even has a chance but you make very valid points and we'll be sure they're included. TY

@_date: 2014-11-05 22:11:53
Yes, same problem, kept emailing them just got verified 2 days ago :) They still wont honor their free $10 in BTC promo though :(
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:03:38
 I will. If it has to go that far, to the school board, It won't be pretty
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:53:12
I can understand my downvotes to an extent but why yours? This is why this sub makes little sense to me at times

My thoughts as well. I just am shocked by his teacher. And the way she put him down, she broke my little mans spirit and now I will crush her!! :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:14:25
I seen that ivor, thanks for your support. I don't think many realized I have my own BTC which I've given away for free in and giveaways in your sub. I never asked for a tip and I need not to come up with fictional stories to try and get tips.
@_date: 2014-11-07 22:17:49
Hey Victoria, 


I truly, truly believe that this technology and focus on micropayments will - and is - changing our world.
Can't agree more!

@_date: 2014-12-05 14:21:29
Never asked for a tip

TY! He's very bright and gets great grades, Im just shocked by this teacher, He's ten! I think she should write an essay explaining herself and actions towards a 10 yr old student.

have more

You have my precious????
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:13:03

@_date: 2014-12-05 15:22:38
You're a genius, my laptop is not connected to a printer. It's a rough draft, he's not allowed to even use calculators for math yet, why the hell would he type his rough draft? You're an alcoholic by your own admission and have serious psychological issues
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:47:18
It was all good until I read this:


Participation is free of charge. We only require an activation fee when the jar is created. The fee will be equal to 8-10 USD worth of bitcoins, but currently is set at 0.003 BTC.
Who stores the bitcoins?
Bitcoins are stored by the jar owners directly. The Bitcoin Jar has not set up a wallet service yet.
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:10:59
Can I get a TL;DR on the amounts please?
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:41:19
Agreed, the ignorance just amazes me. She is young so I didnt really expect this sort of response. If she was an old timer it might be a little understandable. But what she wrote is completely unacceptable
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:11:15
@_date: 2014-11-02 02:32:37
TY sir,  I doubt i'll ever make it half way there :/
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:42:55
Seriously, where are you fauceting? I need to get in on it. A wise user once told me it was a waste of time, you seem to be proving him wrong very quickly.
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:34:21


It'd definitely spark some interest IMO
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:14:34
Because its about all I have, sadly, and you've been doing quite a bit of tipping 
1000 bits private
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:57:22


That will no longer be true (if) once the next bubble starts. If it doesn't, Bitcoin will go to 0, and the joke will be even funnier. 
Since you at least found humor in the joke, I know this is meager crumbs in this sub but:
100 bits @_date: 2014-11-10 22:07:38


That's my point my friend
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:58:43
Well let's not hope he gets too confident and thinks he knows better than Dad, which I highly doubt. We have an awesome relationship, better than I had with my dad. The BTC tips were definitely unexpected but most definitely appreciated. I just wanted him to see how many internet strangers would agree with his views and help prove his teacher is so wrong. And I must say everyone has done a great job of that
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:31:41
I agree, and that's really sad
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:41:02
IDK, but its not staying polite :/
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:25:34
Sorry, as I stated I just wanted him to see their are plenty of ppl that support BTC. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:11:32
probably, did you try @_date: 2014-11-10 19:58:07
Victoria, I also need you to speak with your team about the troubles I have when using multiple devices. If I'm logged into my reddit acct but on a different device ie. My wife's PC I cannot view my wallet. It seems to accept and distribute tips from my wallet but it won't let me view it, always shows hers. I've tried clearing browser history, logging back in and out, etc. No dice :/
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:44:00
I promise :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:17:19
LOL! I used to do the same thing! I used to buy in bulk from sams club and sell! My parents had the same reaction as your dad, too weird. 


Awesome success story! Congrats
Will do, he says Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:02:18


Basically, anyone. The Bitcoin Jar's main rule is – first come, first served. The rule is valid unless different rules are established by the jar owners. For more details check the "Rules" at the jar's subpages.
That's kind of ambiguous, I imagine the "unless different rules are established by the jar owners" will make it that much more difficult for "basically anyone"
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:36:20
I agree and that was not me, and I had to deal with those assholes all night
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:27:38

Being the better man with dignity, i applaud you
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:08:02
I dont see much tipping if any done on their end, Id ignore it :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:38:05
Wow, thanks so much
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:43:44
NP man, keep up the good work! Welcome to the community, I look forward to more videos :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:42:00
That didn't go through for some reason but thanks for the thought
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:37:26
He says TY :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:23:23
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:21:57
I can PM you with most of these if it puts you at ease
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:18:35
Feliz Navidad to you too
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:22:37
I truly hope a handwriting. Expert does look at the post so everyone can eat their words.
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:45:26
He says Thanks, Unfortunately I'm also getting inbox replies from buttcoiners and now am having to go into deeper detail about their lack of intelligence :/
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:09:41
@_date: 2014-12-06 16:03:37
All I wanted, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:20:29
I used to think the same thing but it seems change is on the move, users in used to seem cold and aloof but I've noticed many more genuine, kind, and helpful users emerging making me feel more comfortable here
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:05:18
Exactly! And willing and wanting to give a speech to his peers!
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:14:15
TY, Exactly! I plan to bring my laptop with me and allow them to read through the comments and maybe educate them! He was so passionate the past few weeks and even more when receiving the assignment. He looked up all the info on his own, took some things I have been trying to teach him, and was ready and proud to teach his classmates about BTC. He's an A student, now he's pretty bummed :( trying to keep his spirits up!
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:37:23
Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:59:22
cool story bro
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:21:41
That's fine, but telling him he's wrong and his passion is a Ponzi scheme, giving an A student an incomplete, and making him re-write it about Ponzi schemes or the incomplete remains is unacceptable and not going to happen
Edit: Your Edit takes my comment out of context, but I'll leave it
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:31:05
that feels so much better, TY :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:23:52
He says thanks :) ,  I am going to refuse to have him write about Ponzi schemes but I will have him include it in his BTC paper and how it is clearly not
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:29:29
lol, Nice
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:21:24
Absolutely! And he thanks you :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:45:19


Excellent idea


I hope he already knows this, in fact, he just told me he knows after he read that :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 23:55:42
Nice ride, the plate is probably the only thing I can afford in that picture
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:47:53

@_date: 2014-11-02 16:27:05
Wow. Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:12:07
I'm going to, perhaps I got lost in translation. My original intent was to show him that BTC is indeed the future and show him how many internet strangers will support him. The main problem, lies with the attitude and the incomplete and forcing him to write on a topic that has nothing to do with the original assignment and instead on what she wants
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:31:32
He thanks you
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:17:24
Depending on the outcome, it's a possibility
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:39:39
Im pretty sure you're correct!
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:35:26
I had no problems, I know some have though
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:36:47

@_date: 2014-12-04 21:52:36
How about now?
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:57:37
What happened man?
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:26:06
Oh I know,  lol
Edit: today though they have been very kind
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:33:17
you're taking it too personal, this is the internet friend 
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:33:32
Great Job! I'm participating in a similar movement :)  
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:40:18
It would be funny though
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:07:58


He approached me as he see's me tipping on reddit.


Kids these days are developing much faster, but he does enjoy play, he also enjoys finances and Im not going to take that away from him
@_date: 2014-11-02 03:34:39
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:21:06
Very kind, Thanks
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:29:56

I dont get it
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:19:58
YW :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:03:16
he's tipping $1.50+ in different subs how/why is he embarrassing himself or @_date: 2014-11-02 13:08:48
PM sent, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:58:06
Nice, I'd be content with 1 myself 


If you truly feel that way I say keep reaching for the sky :)

@_date: 2014-11-07 22:25:49
Well Done :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:43:28
Agreed, I'm not entirely sure what could have been her thought process
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:17:44
I try to let him do his schoolwork as independently as he can but I think this is definitely a different case
@_date: 2014-11-13 21:27:32


I agree.
@_date: 2014-11-01 05:17:21
lol, thanks
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:55:23

He's reading all of this with me so you just told him, lol. The TY's are coming from him. Im just commenting and typing :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:16:48
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:16:48
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:08:45
I think it's a combination of both.


Will do! Any other Articles or information to shove down their throats is encouraged!
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:20:15
Don't make a new account just to get bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:52:21

@_date: 2014-12-04 23:01:22
I won't, I am going to present the facts in a professional and intelligent manner. I will be expecting her to apologize. If she has such strong feelings the appropriate response would have been a simple "Please choose a different topic" He says TY :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:04:04
Already planning on it! :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:39:01

Youtubers and Tweeters :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:29:04
That means a lot Diapolis, they are really getting to me. I added a closer pic of the handwriting, I don't see how anyone can think it's the same. I also have a pic of my son holding the paper, I had it public but then ppl started making comments about his appearance and that really pissed me off. If you'd like I'll share his pic with you. who I thought was a friend, in internet terms at least, questioning my validity doesn't help matters either
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:00:20

I quit FB 15 months ago...
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:48:42
I normally don't allow him on Reddit. But since he's crushed and losing his faith in something he was so excited and confident about, I'm going to allow him to read the comments with me on this post. Please be kind he is ten and already upset :(
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:04:56
over or not over?

I cant even get Circle to give me the $10 promo that they advertised :/ and it took 2 weeks to get my bank acct verified and nothing but an apology.
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:48:27
I remember our first endeavours in spreading bitcoin through changetip. Best of luck my friend! :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:14:26

@_date: 2014-12-05 00:34:20
Exactly, that's why this is absurd
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:48:41
Although you're where I'd love to be, I completely agree with "Every little helps"  
I should have $10 more but Circle wouldnt honor their $10 promo :(
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:16:46

@_date: 2014-11-04 03:09:22
I was the same way until I was tipped a week ago, now Im hooked. And as soon as Circle gets my acct verified I hope to have a little more :)

@_date: 2015-01-06 20:34:35
Haven't seen you in awhile. Why would sane ppl downvote a giveaway? When did I say I cared about the upvotes? I didn't post anything, your comment is irrelevant. Also you never pm'd me those links. See this is how sane ppl converse.
Edit: why the anger all the time or is that how you speak in your everyday life?

Ive talked with my wife about this before, we live in a rural area so our options are very limited
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:43:52
I didn't help him write any of it. We've discussed it on several occasions. And most of it he found on the internet
