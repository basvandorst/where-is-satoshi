"For what it's worth the Bitcoin Core team is doing their fair share of namesquatting the bitcoin name by owning the name on GitHub to keep their implementation (called Bitcoin Core) under this name and giving the impression that they are Bitcoin."
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:33:27


Could possibly be to blocks being in memory, and not saved to disk. When the computer crashed/restarted Bitcoin wasn't given time to gracefully shut down and save the current state to disk.
18hrs at an average of 6 blocks an hour and let's just go with an average of 2M per block.
6 * 2 * 18 = 216M = Well under Bitcoins default mempool / dbcache state. 
Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm misrepresenting what's going on here, but this is a possibility per my understanding.

I've seen functional drug users of all sorts. You probably unawaredly know some, some who are even friends. 
Someones drug of choice is of no matter to me as long as they're not fucking with anyone else. 
Pure chemicals / plants that are labeled as such aren't really anymore dangerous than any other if taken with proper dosages and combinations in mind. 
I think drugs are an excellent way to remove yourself from your current pattern of actions so you can "escape" the situation, either by having fun or introspection. 
I also think that the demonization of drugs has led people to not understand their purpose and usefulness as a tool, but rather as a necessary implementation to everyday life.

We imagine a world where people treat psychoactives with respect and awareness; where people work together to collect and share knowledge in ways that strengthen their understanding of themselves and provide insight into the complex choices faced by individuals and societies alike. We believe that truth, accuracy, and integrity in publishing information about psychoactives will lead to healthier and more balanced choices, behaviors, and policies around all psychoactive medications, entheogens, herbs, and recreational drugs. Erowid's vision is to facilitate and create resources that are part of the evolution towards this goal.

    When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
    Each visited site is also served by you.
    Every site contains a content.json file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash and a signature generated using the site's private key.
    If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the site, then he/she signs the new content.json and publishes it to the peers. Afterwards, the peers verify the content.json integrity (using the signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to other peers.

Like, the whole purpose of Bitcoin? 
Downloading one huge chunk of data isn't always viable for everyone either, and no guarantee that your one huge chunk of data will be valid. Downloading in increments, individual blocks, allows the most efficient use. 
If you're getting a "preloaded chain," where are you getting it from? 
One big download? A torrent which is outdated instantly and won't be seeded? Mailed to you (giving away personal information)? 
Lot's of flaws issue from my point of view. 
By "security" I assume you're just referring to the software, and of course, the software will function the same way no matter how you obtain the data.

**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[Conbase closed Gab account](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly 
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

They're really quite simple. 
"Abortion" is killing humans. Where you stand on it is subjective. 
Genital mutilation (circumcision) is a human rights violation. Not your body, not your choice. This is non-negotiable, unless you're okay with female genital mutilation, then at least you're consistent. 
"Transgenderism" is a a bundle of co-morbid mental illness, facts. You can identify as a toaster for all I care, I have no issues with people playing make believe. Just don't expect anyone to bow to your fantasies.

* Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is unavailable.
* Real-time updated sites
* Namecoin .bit domains support
* Easy to setup: unpack &amp; run
* Clone websites in one click
* Password-less BIP32 based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet
* Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: Allows easier site development and faster page load times
* Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of IPv4 addresses
* TLS encrypted connections
* Automatic uPnP port opening
* Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support
* Works with any browser/OS
**How does it work?**
* After starting zeronet.py you will be able to visit zeronet sites using  (eg. 
* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
* Each visited site is also served by you.
* Every site contains a content.json file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash and a signature generated using the site's private key.
* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the site, then he/she signs the new content.json and publishes it to the peers. Afterwards, the peers verify the content.json integrity (using the signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to other peers.

You apparently don't know about the different forms of FGM and how the most common is not as damaging as common MGM. 
* Type I: Also known as clitoridectomy, this type consists of partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or its prepuce.
* Type II: Also known as excision, the clitoris and labia minora are partially or totally removed, with or without excision of the labia majora.
* Type III: The most severe form, it is also known as infibulation or pharaonic type. The procedure consists of narrowing the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or labia majora, with or without removal of the clitoris. The appositioning of the wound edges consists of stitching or holding the cut areas together for a certain period of time (for example, girls’ legs are bound together), to create the covering seal. A small opening is left for urine and menstrual blood to escape. An infibulation must be opened either through penetrative sexual intercourse or surgery.
* Type IV: This type consists of all other procedures to the genitalia of women for non-medical purposes, such as pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.

How much RAM does the Surface have? It looks like you've set the dbcache  fairly high. I'm not sure how much RAM your OS (Windows 10?) consumes. Are you using the Surface while Bitcoin is syncing?  You could be running out of memory. 
From a quick image search, if I'm finding the right device, the Surface Pro 3 is a light, portable device. With such a compact form factor, it *may* be overheating and crashing? Get a temperature monitor application to keep an eye on it. 
Rolling forward is fine. It wasn't shut down properly so it's checking the work it dumped (not properly saved) to disk before it died (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong devs.) 
If you could post your bitcoin.conf file (with omitted personal information) it would also be helpful.
