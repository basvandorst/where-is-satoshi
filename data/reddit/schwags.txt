I hold Litecoin, but I got to admit after Charlie dumped I lost a lot of confidence. It would be like a Satoshi sold all his bags. With Bitcoin lightning working, I'm just not sure if LTC really has much of a use case any more. I'm not going to sell or anything since I basically got it at zero, but any new money I put into crypto is probably going to go into something with more utility like XMR or ETH.

I am aware of lamassu's  disclaimers.  That is what prompted me to do the research. The lawyers are saying we need an mtl as a cya, but I am wondering what will happen when someone actually goes to court.

I got this too and just posted about it without seeing your post was already here. I do have a gox account, but never used it. I recognized it as a phishing message the second I opened it, but am more interested in knowing if there was any malicious scripting in the message itself that I need to be worried about. I can forward the message if someone would like to analyze it.

My trail of thought was similar.  If I can sell bitcoin person to person,  why not with an automated machine? Well,  I remember some guys in Florida getting in hot water for person to person sales just a week ago.  So, I guess the legality of this whole thing is still up in the air.  It will be interesting to see how precedents are set.  We just need to make sure bitcoin is not blamed for illegal activity done by drug dealers and money launderers.

1. Sign up for an exchange account
2. Fuck, exchange doesn't support my state...
3. Sign up for ANOTHER exchange
4. Wait for KYC verification.
5. Wait...
6. Wait...shit, btc is dropping/rising!
7. Wait...
8. Finally link to bank account
9. Wait for deposit verification 
10. Transfer funds
11. Wait....
12. Wait....shit shit shit...btc is really moving!
13. Wait more...(seriously, more than a week, sometimes 2 when busy)
14. Ok, buy bitcoin! (After it rose or fell more than 10%)
OR you can run down to the atm SAME DAY with cash and get it sent to your wallet almost instantly,  like crypto was supposed to be...

The analogy I like to use is the one of the bank teller versus the cash drawer. I came up with this during the bch split to explain why lightning was better than big blocks.
Before lightning, every time somebody wanted to make a transaction the shopkeeper or the buyer would essentially have to go to the bank, stand in line and wait for a teller, and then transfer the funds from their account to the other parties accounts.
As Bitcoin became more popular and more people wanted to use it, the lines at the banks got longer and longer. Sometimes, it would take hours to get to the teller where they could record the transaction in the central registry and confirm that funds had changed hands. Some people would slip a couple extra bucks to the security guard and they would get to cut in line. This generally pissed everybody off.
One solution was to add more tellers so that we could simultaneously handle more people at one time. This works for a while, but eventually your bank buildings get as large as city blocks and the lines still continue to grow. At some point, the streets get clogged with people waiting in line. The whole thing generally is not very scalable.
The other solution is to instead keep a cash drawer at each business. Businesses would go to the bank, withdraw some money, and commit a certain amount to that cash drawer at the beginning of the day. Over the course of the day, customers would pay money to the cash drawer and the business would pay money to its vendors out of the cash drawer. This whole time, nobody is reporting these transactions to the central bank. Nobody has to stand in a big line, everything is pretty much instant. Now, eventually the business is going to want to deposit it's accumulated income into the bank. At that time, they can go to the bank and do so. The lines should be relatively short because everyone else has a cash drawer so businesses only need to visit the bank a couple times a week. Consumers also get to visit the bank only once in a while. They carry a wallet with a little bit of cash that they can use just like the business uses their cash drawer.
In the end, it's pretty obvious to see that the second solution is the most scalable. As more people are added to the network, they can inherently keep their own wallets and cash drawers. The central register only has to accommodate the periodic transactions when an entity either takes money out to commit to its cash drawer or puts money in because they've grown a surplus.
I don't claim that this analogy is perfect. It has however helped me explain lightning to many people in the past in a suitable fashion, at least enough so that they'd understand the purpose of the technology.

Ugh, unfortunately, I have run into this too. This is why I believe that we need to 'rebrand' and start using mbits or similar. Maybe we start with mbit (1/1000ths) and when that becomes too much for someone to afford we move to ubits (1/1000000th). That still leaves 2 decimal places for smaller transactions when 1 ubit = $1. I think a lot of people would enter the market if they believed that bitcoin had 'split' into 1000ths (stocks split all of the time, but I admit not to this degree).

It's not that easy, you can't just buy it out of thin air. You have to have cash somewhere. Either in a bank wired to an exchange, or physically put into a BTM you still need to enter cash somewhere. Until everybody uses crypto, there's going to have to be an on-ramp and an off-ramp from fiat.

It's been a few years so I don't remember all the details but essentially you had to apply for a license from a governmental agency. I think it was Federal? You we're not guaranteed approval but you still had to pay an exorbitant amount of money in order to apply Money Services business.

I looked into getting into the Bitcoin ATM business a few years back. I would have had to put at least $100,000 up front to apply to be a money transfer agent. In my state you basically have to register as a bank. It just wasn't worth it at the time. You may want to check the rules in Japan and make sure there's not something similar, that may be a very good reason that nobody has spent the money.

Wasn't there a comment somewhere else in this subreddit on another post about this very same thing that explains that this was a temporary creation of funds that will be destroyed less than 24 hours later?

There are a hundred million Santoshi in a bitcoin, I think if I ran something for a few years it wouldn't be too unreasonable to expect a million.
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:48:12
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Bitcoin. I'm usually the one defending it actually. What I'm referring to is the fact that when the blocks are not able to handle the transactional volume, you have to set a higher fee to get your transactions included in a reasonable time. True, the blocks will always march along every 10 minutes, but your transactions aren't going to get included unless you pay the going rate. 
I was around in the spring of 2018. I remember this happening. I paid ridiculous fees to move my coin around. I also remember lightning being extremely young at the time. The whole damn thing (the rally) happened too early, we weren't ready. For the last couple of years I've been hoping that lightning was going to mature and take off so that by the time the next boom happened we would be able to handle the surge. But, I fear we are not there. The community has spent most of their time bitching and moaning about prices and the general sense of "how to make this better" seems to have fallen away in favor of stupid ass memes.
Lightning need to be THE STANDARD and its not. Everyone (ALL exchanges, ALL wallets, ALL payment services and bridges to USD) need to use it and they are not. In all honesty, I hope BTC stays right where it is till we can get our act together and can handle the growth.

I'm still not sold on this device in general, but I do like the idea of it helping to decentralize mining again. Everybody is so concerned about how profitable mining is yet they don't realize if they leave it up to just a few big boys they pretty much ruined the whole experiment. I myself still mine with a few block erupters. They are not profitable whatsoever, but I'm also not really losing much in terms of power costs and I am helping in my small way to reinforce the block chain.

Sure, crappy antivirus such as McAfee or Norton does take up quite a bit of processor power, especially on an antiquated system. Good antivirus like Eset or avira or BitDefender on a recent system doesn't make much of an impact at all.
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:36:17
Yes I did read it. It basically says that having an antivirus installed opens up some additional exploit opportunities. However, it doesn't give any details on which products were tested, or the versions, or what the actual exploits were. For all I know the majority of the worst exploits were from some backwater b******* antivirus that I would never put on my machine in the first place.
I still think it is better to have a product that may have a few holes in it than have nothing at all and have to deal with all of the holes in your operating system and plugins excetera.
I made the comments about the PC Matic guy because your comments seem to be based in fear, just like his stupid commercials.

Here's the thing, a well written virus is almost impossible to detect once it is installed. However the dropper is much easier to detect if you have a virus scanning resident running at the time it is downloaded. I get people coming in my shop all the time with the same opinion as yours, and guess what, we find a shitload of viruses. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:41:48
Okay fine, you are obviously not the target audience of my business. But, do you really think you will never make a mistake? Do you really think you are going to know exactly what is in that bit of code you are about to execute? You will eventually slip up or get tricked into clicking something you shouldn't have, and an antivirus would be there to detect malicious code as a backup to your judgement. 
What if that little executable you just downloaded has some kind of packed code in it that is not detectable by a  scan? There's no way for some infections to be detected unless it is actually being executed, in which you need a resident virus scanner to do so.
I never tell anybody an antivirus is always going to protect you all the time, I tell people that an antivirus is like a safety net, not a shield that allows you to go blazing into the internet and click on anything you want. You still need to be careful surfing the internet, keep all of your patches installed, your operating system up to date, don't click on certain things, etc, but at 2 a.m. in the morning when you accidentally click on something you shouldn't have your antivirus should be there to protect you.

In that case you could do what we did before we had hardware wallets. I had a dedicated laptop that I purchased from an equipment recycling company for a couple hundred bucks. I installed Ubuntu in an encrypted volume on the machine and used that machine exclusively for crypto wallets. I know a little bit about Linux so I locked it down and tried my best to secure it. Never had an issue. Ended up turning it into a virtual machine and saving it for posterity LOL.
