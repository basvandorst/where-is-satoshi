Ruben thank you for this invaluable collection of tips! I will make sure I consider them all as we start to build our membership. 4 signups in the first two days so it's looking promising.

The SwarmCoin product definition is here:   . It states 
"The Value of SWARM Coins:
The value of SWARM coins is derived from the following:
(1) Right of access to features on the SWARM platform, including early access to crowd
sales on the SWARM platform and various advanced features (i.e. reports from our decentralized due diligence network).
(2) May be convertible for, or provide for discounted purchasing of, future products
launched on the SWARM platform, either through SWARM itself or additional coins that
serve as coupons.
(3) May be traded and/or sold at a market-determined price.
(4) Additional perks offered inside the SWARM network."

Sounds like a fantastic project but I wonder is there any possibility that gateway holders could enter into fraud / theft?
