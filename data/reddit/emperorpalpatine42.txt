Straw man.  Straw man.  Wrong.  Once correct statement.  Wrong.   
You clearly have a viewpoint, but you unable to express it with truth.

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast  
The slow one now, will later be fast  
As the present now, will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin'.  
And the first one now will later be last  
For the times they are a-changin'.

It depends on the options of the wallet you are using.  Usually some version of sending another transaction with a  higher fee from the same address.  After one transaction is included in a block, the other will become invalid.  See: fee bump.

I agree that its not ready for mass adoption until there are very simple, and easy to use lightning network wallets.  Bitcoin might be complicated, but it works very predictably.

Whatever they choose to use.  Because that is the most important thing: that people can op in to consensus rules that reflect their values.

A company pre-sells tokens for a platform.  The tokens are traded on the open market.  The value of these tokens is dependent on the performance and value of the platform that the company builds and maintains.  That is textbook security.  
The two arguments that I see for why this is not a security are: 1. Development has become so decentralized that the company is no longer responsible for, or in charge of, the platform's health and development.  2. People do not buy ETH to speculate on its price, they buy it to use it.  
I find both of these arguments to be very problematic.  
1 Because giving an unregistered security years of runway to operate, then declaring it is no longer a security is a weird and murky precedent to set.  How decentralized is decentralized enough?  How do you measure decentralization?  How much time do you give other companies in clear violation of securities law to become decentralized?  2 Because claiming that investors were not buying in hopes of the value going up, that they wanted to buy over 2 million dollars worth of cloud processing on a yet to be released platform in 2014 is... unconvincing.  
Downvote me gently daddy.

I did not say that.  I don't feel like engaging with someone who is just going to twist everything into straw-man or other deflections.

The system is voluntary and the fees are self determined.  If you think Bitcoin transactions will become so important that people will pay hundreds of dollars for them, you are more optimistic about Bitcoin than most.

Why the fuck does everyone here hate this TA guy?  Just don't watch his shit.  I can only assume bagholders get emotional when someone says their investment is bad.

This is interesting because it goes to my not seeing the connection.  In Bitcoin, production does not slow or increase because of mining increase or decrease.  Its 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes on average regardless, for now.  Increased price does cause more profit, which causes more mining, which causes increased difficulty, but not production.  So as far as I can see, price affects mining difficulty, but mining difficulty does not affect price directly.

Stockmarkets are already regulated, and you must trust third parties to participate.   If you REALY tokenize the stocks, you make it possible trade regulated stocks to unknown third parties.  This would be a large breach of anti-money-laundering practices. 
Forcing a digital token to represent something other than just itself requires someone to enforce that idea in the real world.  It is a inherently centralized structure, the opposite of what most pepole think about when they talk about tokens as being somehow related to 'cryptocurrency.'  
They might do some half-assed, imitation crypto, government program, nothing more. 
Tokenization is the new ICO: it has a place, but for now, its exiting, not well understood, and a great fundraising tool.

Holding since 480 on the downward trend.  I invested less than I could afford to lose, and just stopped paying attention after months of 'losses'.  I learned how to set up hardware software and paper wallets.  I missed selling at the highs in 17.  I use the lightning network to buy Steam games now.  See you in 4 years.

I agree.  Sidechains offer the same utility that Etherium does no?

You can use that to infer that less efficient miners will shut off, but I feel like a better source for that conclusion would be:

The risk management department sees that your unusual activity increases their risk model by 1%.  You as a customer are not worth that, so they cut you.

I have never understood this logic.  Why would the break even point of some Bitcoin miners influence the market price of a Satoshi?
