Mars is at closest 4 light-minutes at furthest 24 light minutes, the block time is 10 minutes ��

Well assuming a Gaussian distribution that statement would be super obvious

Problem: 
Bitcoin as currently designed is not scalable for a interplanetary transaction network
Math:  
At light speed ( the speed information propagates) Martians will face severe delays. Mars is at most 24 light minutes from earth. Martian miners receive the blockchain 24 minutes after its current. They find a block then send it back, waiting another 24 minutes. Total 48 minutes now. To be sure that their block is part of the longest chain (hint it’s probably not) they will have to receive the latest copy of the chain another 24 minutes. Total 72 minutes. They are now on avg 7 blocks behind the current chain if they continued mining. 
Correct me if I’m wrong

Lightspeed delay

Hey I appreciate your analytical replies. 
 I understand your solution but it to raises bigger problems.
1. Where does mining for that interplanetary chain take place? 
2. In a multi-planet scenario how do you now account for the lightspeed delay? 
Say we have colonized Europa, mars, and earth of course.  Transactions from Europa take much longer then transactions from mars! How do you settle interplanetary transactions in this scenario? 
Jupiter is 53 light minutes away from earth at its furthest. At some point mars will also be at its furthest 24 minutes away from earth.  How do you avoid orphaning a Jupiter block?

Oh okay from what I’m understanding there is some centralized entity that is in charge of sending transactions inbetween side chains? I.E. Earth to Europa, Mars to earth etc. 
Isn’t that sort of centralization exactly what bitcoin was set out to disrupt?
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:37:10
Bitcoin would suck for anyone living on mars, there blocks would constantly be gettin orphaned and transaction times would be extremely slow
