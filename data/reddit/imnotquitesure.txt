I think all of you misunderstand that Ripple is a company with two main products, interledger protocol and xrp. Each one has their use and space. Theyre going after banks first to get established and regulations through for utilizing consensus protocols and blockchain tech as a means of foreign exchange. XRP is positioned as a currency to be used as a bridge. They have also recently announced a new CEO who specializes in scaling out. He declared that his focus will be deeper market penetration and the roll out new use cases. I would guess they want to enter new consumer markets.

So much hopeful wishing in this thread. Bitcoin went up this year, so it's just HAS to be approved. LOLOL
@_date: 2016-11-27 03:01:24
Oh, it's ok now, that means bitcoin is a reliable payment system again. Just forget everything that happened last week. 
That couldn't happen again. No way.  Everything is fine. We should use it for everything. Don't worry if you have something important to do. It will work that day of course. Maybe. /s

Santander is using ILP and investing in building products around that. It is a product many banks are now using which lets them keep their personal ledgers private, but exchange currencies with other banks while complying with KYC laws. Its quietly gaining network effect, and allowing banks to use blockchain technology without reinventing the wheel.  Goldman was looking at SETL,  but it appears to be a bit behind and more highly centralized.
The problem with banks creating their own coin is liquidity and the network effect. You need lots of people to accept it, and or a way to trade between currencies quickly and in a well regulated way that doesnt expose them to risk. There are several emerging market leaders in this space quietly doing just that while bitcoin stumbles. Large banks move billions a day in foreign currency and bitcoin is already straining under pressure.

I think so far they've being pretty effective at stalling it. Also, banks aren't focused on a single currency, they're investing in solutions that let them profit off of many/any currency so articles like this aren't really a huge deal for bitcoin, because a bank wasn't ever going to settle on a single currency. It's just interesting how people use these articles to create FUD over something that never was. Also, I can't tell if you're upset at core/SW, BU or just the fact that bitcoin isn't the end all be all of currency. I was just trying to explain why I think these companies are dropping out of R3.

Im sorry you seem to be upset with how the world works, lol. Tell me why its not already mainstream then. Does your business use it?

You must not be familiar with Ripple. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 06:26:09
Perhaps you should work harder at understanding technical terminology. Many of us understand it well. You even told one user he was a winner. Ive seen a man eat his shirt on reddit before in order to keep his word. You seem to be wanting to say anything you can to avoid paying up. I believe you may simply be lacking integrity.
@_date: 2016-11-19 04:25:11
I think several people did and the positive upvotes show that. You just already had your preconcieved notions and refused to understand anything you didnt agree with. Pretty lame, I say.  Its ok. .1btc is probably something you never had anyways. Perhaps you should be clearer on your rules and expectations before you bet money you're no good at following through on. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:21:36
You were extremely specific in your post, going so far as to indicate the specific time/block of your raffle showing you were intent on following rules to the letter. Then in your arguments, you switched to spirit/intentions of the words. When people found a loophole, you back-pedaled. When people made good arguments, you disagreed in opinion every time. To me for example, you disagreed with the first one regarding intentions of the core of bitcoin and began to inject your own opinion to disqualify me. This causes you to appear insincere. The way I see it, there are several ways that you could restore your integrity. First, you could update your post indicating that this was a joke and you believe they are all saying similar things, and you never intended to pay out in the first place. You could also figure out a way, such as most upvoted, to select a few and run the raffle after the block indicated. Either of those would restore  your integrity. Do you really need this explained to you, or are you just a troll? ;)

1. No "Official" Bitcoin: -&gt; This refers specifically to branding. No site/user/group should claim "official" status of bitcoin. It's not anything except how we use it. To claim there is a single product, use case, group, is a lie. There is no official site, wallet, pool, use case, etc. 
2. Multiple Implementations: -&gt; This refers to scope of the possible use cases of bitcoin. For example, bitcoin has been implemented as a store of value to be transferred in some instances, it is also used for its permanence such as a checksum holding chain that cannot be undone by multiple cryptography groups. Both of these are valuable use cases. 
3. Diversity of innovation: -&gt; indicates that there should be multiple implementations of the technology for each of those possible use cases.  This is to ensure that no single group or use case is a single dependency/point of failure and hopefully ensure that bitcoin remains maintained, and valuable to people for each of the implemented use cases. Multiple groups have wallet implementations. Multiple sites and technologies use it to store checksums. This diversity gives it strength.  More people using it for more things in many different ways means it is more likely to be well maintained, yet protected from changing it's basic function of a distributed cryptographically secure chain of transactions.
4. Bitcoin is Leaderless: -&gt; This indicates that none of the use cases or implementations should have priority over the others. One team who uses it as a store of value, does not get to change it's form in such a way that it can't be used for checksums, or vice versa. There is no more important use from each other, and no team can claim to lead the direction of it's development. That must be done through consensus.
5. refers to discussion of these uses cases and technology implementations. Discourse surrounding them should be open and uncensored.
edits to clarify.

And a payment processor is exactly what I was referring to when I said another company, like Visa, or Paypal, or a bank, because at the moment the rest of the world runs on various fiat currencies, and you still need them to get in and out of bitcoin as it rises and tumbles 30$ a day. Coinbase for example charges a fee for their risk, and at the moment it's more than most other bitcoin payment processors. They have methods to mitigate that risk and charge for it. It's people like you who are responsible for this pump and dump scheme and the fact that it can't evolve past a great idea into a mature product. 
You guys want this to succeed so badly, yet you've lost sight of the way to true success, playing well with others. Every currency needs to pin to the others to be useful. Or is this a commodity? Whatever you need to be to skirt laws, right? This echo chamber is hilarious. Every time it stumbles I just flip back and forth thru alts and ride the waves. Go run some BTU nodes, or write some code to replace core. Start a business that enables bitcoin to fiat transfer incredibly cheap. Screaming on reddit to someone who offered an opinion to a question does nothing for your cause. So fuck off with your idealistic immature teenage angst, and go educate yourself on the world of finance.

yeah. this. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:39:03
see edits for clarity. Implementation = possible use cases. putting a plan into effect. Ie. how do you use the thing you have.  official = a claim of authority. There is no official implementation. Theres some big ones, but no one owns bitcoin or has right to declare what or who is official.

OP, Who won the raffle? 
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:29:31
Im sure it is. Like I said, you lack integrity.  Thats what people like you do instead of admit that you had ill intentions rather than keep your word when people called your bet. You argued with everyone who did as you asked, and then you didnt keep your word when it didnt suit you. If this were a card game, you'd be the person no one invites back. You're the one who has to live with you. Good day sir.

To directly respond to your questions, I don't think anyone is making their own coins. Banks are making payment solutions and they're already up to the network effect level. 
If lighting goes live I'm sure people will use it for bitcoins. I was simply pointing out that regulation ready solutions are already in the implementation phase with the big banks. ILP is also open source, and already included in the javascript library today for anyone to use. I think banks are just moving to the next steps, not trying to create their own coins. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 05:21:55
Whoa, who has the attitude? I'm simply pointing out that bitcoin has been stalled by the community arguments. mempool is full and transactions are delayed today. This article is about banks dropping out of R3 and you came at me attacking when I posted facts with linked articles? I'm not sure what's going on here but you seem upset. Are you losing money or something? 
You indicated that it's going to take everyone playing well together for something to take off. I'm simply saying that the bankers are well on their way to doing just that. 
Did I offend you in some way? 
Edit: You seem to be upset at the BU community. I'm not sure why unless they're causing you personal losses. Like you said, they're just idealists. I watch many subreddits and call out things I observe. One of the things I am observing are open-source solutions competing with many corporate solutions. You don't seem terribly friendly. Perhaps that's why it's hard to respond.

Its a large risk for a normal business to use on day to day transactions. Too slow, and not any backers or recourse in the event of fraud. Any crypto coin will first need the backing and approval of someone willing to accept those risks in order to break into mainstream use. Think of things like a bank, or Visa, or Paypal. Those companies have established insurance and methods of risk mitigation already in place.

Why are you spending it? bitcoin is for hodlers.
