$100,000 is certainly possible in a year or two, but its the peak of a bubble. it doesnt mean much because not many will sell at that price. but it sounds good
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:20:22
step up from 11111, not to mention 6666
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:46:25
thats what master says. just a comment that its difficult to take predictions seriously when the predictor cant even proof read his predictions. my advice would be to invest, but if you know nothing about it might be best to do some research first
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:29:52
who knows with trump.  its great publicity. maybe he just bought a bunch and is trying to pump it
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:11:35
no, its going to $8600 in november
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:24:21
are you sure the whales arent institutions?
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:52:36
when you have something more useful to spend the proceeds on, cant think what, maybe a house, but not fiat
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:15:53
i agree and would guess 4 years, altho it probably will briefly bubble well past that before then
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:10:33
6k is still possible, hope not tho
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:00:59
I dont agree, maybe $50,000 in the next year, 250k in in 2.5 years, for what bubbles are worth.
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:21:38
yes he is right, just avoid fiat altogether when possible. and hold. theres no reason to ever sell back into fiat if you understand bitcoins potential. admittedly I do it all the time to cover my living costs. adoption has a long way to go.  Ive noticed recently where I live theres still plenty of people that havent heard of bitcoin or think its a scam
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:52:33
nobody knows the chances, but it certainly prevails now, and I dont think any change will be fast. just keep an eye on it
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:28:35
good to see hes not the trump fan he used to be
@_date: 2019-03-26 22:47:07
what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2019-03-20 12:12:59
thats a waste of good cocaine
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:25:05
altho bitcoin seems to have a cycle based on halvening its always around base price for months before and after. based on the past, which is obviously no predictor, its being completely predictable
@_date: 2019-11-28 13:26:34
of couse TA works, a lot of science is based on it. but to profit trading bitcoin you are going to need knowledge, time, software, fast internet connections and risk having your bitcoin on markets. its very similar to trying to beat a computer at chess. you arent going to be able to do it manually by studying youtube videos and looking at charts
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:16:48
Im all in so I put off the urge to buy things and hodl instead
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:28:15
biggest in what way? in any case, theres a lot to be said for americans voting in a moron president
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:52:36
its possible, my feeling is that it will remain around 10000 for 3-6 months longer
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:16:40
quite a lot I would guess, but Im just a mere hodler so I will leave that for others
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:55:02
actually mBTC might be better in the meantime, something closer to a dollar. i dont know what they are called, but if btc actually starts being used its not really going to work when you order a coffee and they say "that will be point zero zero zero zero whatever bitcoin thanks"
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:45:28
right, like USB sticks? Ive had a couple of fairly new ones go down on me. I still use them tho, Ive got half a dozen or so located in different places around the world. every few years I make up a new lot with new wallets and when they are safely located shift the funds to them. but you are right, thanks for the reminder, I must be due to update them
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:32:06
thats true, writing isnt really important, but I dont see how you could reduce it down to a font this size without losing most of the detail
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:54:59
depends, I had to buy and sell stuff to get bitcoin. its definitely the best strategy for bitcoin at the moment, or its entire history so far for that matter, but not the best for many other things. also, old men are just young men in old bodies
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:36:37
I suppose it is in the sense that new investors profit early investors, but its not a fraud or a scam and at some stage they will be the new investors
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:28:33
when I do a google search of flash-cards it shows cards with letters on them for learning languages. I presume you are taking about something else?
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:32:06
looks like bitcoin might be drunk
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:03:10
r/typography/ might be able to help
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:51:32
looks good actually, but reduced to the same size as this font you would have less pixels to play with, thats what we need to see. I would guess that theres already a font that has an s like this, not that that matters, we could steal it
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:10:01
believe would be the correct word, just like he doesnt believe in global warming.
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:48:20
where I come from nobody knows what bitcoin is, and they arent interested. this is why i think bitcoin has a long way to go, which is great from an investment point of view
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:16:31
too complex, how will that look as a font this size? you also cant write it by hand, with out a lot of practice anyway. would look good big but not for normal use. or am I missing the joke?
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:49:56
yeah, if I told people I had millions in btc they would just laugh at me
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:31:54
Im surrounded by ignoramuses. SE Asia. pointing with your foot might set them off, but generally they arent interested in anything I say. a lot of them dont even listen when I talk to them because what could a healthy wealthy foreigner have to teach a poverty stricken person that cant read and is just trying to support their sick middle aged parents. most of them havent heard of bitcoin yet. and thats great. it means that bitcoin has a long way to go yet
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:58:28
looking at the charts i dont see any evidence that it affects the price at all, at least not until quite a few months afterwards
@_date: 2019-10-04 13:46:16
altho it competes in some ways I think banks are going to start using it themselves in their back ends to save costs. they are already beginning to. ironically banks might might end up helping crypto become mainstream
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:28:03
I think its likely, could bubble to that in a couple of years and be the normal price in about 6 years
@_date: 2019-10-25 07:17:58
to be close maybe 8.75, its all relative of course
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:47:08
maybe it is time to start using satoshis
@_date: 2019-10-09 11:27:39
I would guess thats close. turns out if you make the time scale logarithmic you will get straight lines and maybe a little more accuracy
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:08:39
there wont be any either side if that happens, but the world is already far more globalized then many politicians want you to know.  Im pretty sure that some of the big players have already begun using bitcoin, at least on an experimental basis
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:03:48
yes, the price is obviously not purely logarithmic and you wouldnt expect it to be, but its similar, but I forget the name for it. obviously it will level out eventually, but the baseline and even the bubbles seem to be following a very predictable exponential curve that is gradually leveling out, as you would expect
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:16:33
that market could be taken, but its a long way off and not going to happen overnight if it does
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:14:22
maybe not perfect, but its certainly not a bad time to buy
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:30:33
if you are panicking over people panicking maybe you arent the tough wild west boy you pretend to be
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:29:14
US president does it all the time. admittedly hes above any laws, but free speech is a thing
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:22:59
there is some truth in what you say, those lines are gradually leveling out over time, but still those highs are very possible. not that it matters much because not many people sell at the top of a bubble
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:56:42
nice but we live 6 months in the future and if you overlay an updated graph not particularly accurate I suspect
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:31:04
about that. guess depends on the exchange. might have been 3350 for 2019, 6500+ for 2020
@_date: 2019-12-28 03:42:06
I think time will make it worth while but in the short term it might be like the internet. much more beneficial information is available but it is also great for spreading propaganda until people educate themselves. many polititians dont know how to email let alone understand the implications of btc
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:37:51
as far as I can tell all countries are socialist and capitalist, it cant be avoided, its how its done that matters
@_date: 2019-12-28 03:38:50
 I dont think they will crumble any more then banks will but they will certainly have to change their ways and there will certainly be some anarchy while they do that
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:32:53
exactly, at the least
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:45:12
I dont really agree. there was an unusual middle size bubble in the middle of the year but its back to a pretty normal price now
@_date: 2019-04-01 04:11:17
I see it as a form of automation, like driverless cars, or computer programs that play chess. driverless cars and chess programs are far superior at decision making than human minds. even with the best of intentions, which is often not the case, humans often make the wrong decisions. the more power we can take from people in government and put in the hands of computers the better and bitcoin is a big step towards that. 
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:31:06
I was in a similar position several years ago. Now thanks to bitcoin Im retired. Theres a lot of luck involved in life and I happened to get lucky but dont give up. also the comments saying you shouldnt be buying btc, I dont get that. I wouldnt be retired if I followed that advice
@_date: 2019-04-01 14:27:40
its also broken the downward line on the log chart, doesnt mean much but its the best its looked since the bubble burst
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:35:13
not sure what socialism is, can you name a country thats not socialist?
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:53:14
I call it base price rather than absolute bottom. we are close to it now, its about 6500. bitcoin is always bullish long term, currently doubling every year roughly
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:03:08
could you explain what you mean by "highlight the most recent data-point"? thanks
edit: I see what that means from the tweet, but how do you read it?
edit: I think I got it, thanks for the info
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:31:06
I think we all know that bitcoin is used to buy and sell drugs, but the article doesnt really say much more then that
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:50:05
isnt that pretty much what the dark net markets are?
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:45:20
it broke thru the bottom of that triangle that been around since june. once people or robots see a trend they follow it. the selling started about 3 hours later
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:10:54
Ive never enjoyed working so its not so difficult. I have more money then I ever dreamed I would have thanks to bitcoin. But, maybe because I spent years in poverty, I still hate to spend, for example I would never spend more then $80 on a second hand smart phone and I hardly ever buy clothes or travel. It just seems excessive even tho I could easily afford it. I do enjoy not having to work tho
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:46:59
its true that its relative. in some ways gold might be a better comparison than the US$. the US$ isnt the worlds only currency or store of value
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:54:39
yep,our days are numbered, just like bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:40:25
Im always amused when I think of all the posts that said bitcoin will never be adopted because its too volatile, yet when its not moving everyone wants volatility
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:46:12
historically that would appear to be true, but it could be some time before bitcoin breaks $14000
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:49:21
I agree, altho $6,600 is still possible
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:06:49
what a blow, I was just about to set up a green party hat factory in china
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:29:26
these kinds of posts are stupid. I mean if you think $100,000 bitcoins are cheap Ive got a deal for you. I will sell you a bunch for $90,000. just PM me
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:41:57
its difficult to know what hes trying to say, its a word salad. what is bitcoin supposed to produce? in a way he is right, its not an investment by design, it just happens to be a very good one
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:13:27
thats what I did. I dont plan on ever cashing out. I just cash out what I need. In the next bubble I might by an apartment or 2. cashing out has its risks as well. having to deal with exchanges and explaining large amounts of cash to banks and governments and possibly paying taxes. easier just to hold
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:31:35
its probably not smart but it has worked extremely well for me
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:57:42
its possible but it has to reach 10,000 first and then there looks to be quite a bit of resistance there to me so i doubt it will blast past
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:13:37
In 5 months I think its going to be about the price it is now, but 100k in 2 years is reasonable. Im all in, so I sell to buy stuff but apart from that I dont intend ever to sell for fiat
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:57:41
$2 million
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:08:22
its a good time but still might be a chance to get in maybe as low as 5000 over the next month or two
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:32:42
thats the big question and the difficult part in making these predictions
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:15:19
message admin. I had a similar thing happen, from memory. I think they removed his negative feedback and may even have removed him as well.
