This is my first reddit comment. I have been reading reddit forums for about a year now. I actually found reddit through bitcoin. After reading this post i made an account. Looking closer I read that the winner has to be active for at least a month. There should be a better way to find fake accounts because this is a very good way to get more people subscribing and it may turn them off when they see that.

Yeah he does oppose Abortion because its inhumane!! He protects the rights of those unborn babies. He does not oppose gay marriage, he feels it should be left to state rights, so you can move if you want to get married. He also does not oppose vaccines he posted a video of his. He just doesn't feel they should be forced upon people. What kind of Nazi are you?

Those "evil" republicans are most of the republican party yes but Rand Paul is not those republicans. Rand Paul is not Supported by most Republicans and I'm sure you know this but you just have an agenda. If you don't, do some research, he is not a pure libertarian either.

Your usually doing something right when everyone is hating. You people saying it would be stupid to vote for a president just because he supports Bitcoin are ignorant. So why would you want to elect a president that may not support, knowing that Bitcoin doesn't need America? You are admitting to voting for it demise. This is a great opportunity for America to catch the train early.

It worries me that these devs are all fracking out about scalability, apparently in its current form bitcoin cannot be a world currency any time soon. Devs would have to wait till the internet is much faster to scale properly. maybe they can use an index till then?

Aren't we passed the whole bitcoin vs blockchain debate. They are literally one with another.
