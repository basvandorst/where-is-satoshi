Who pays for the opening and closing of the channels? I imagine those transactions would still be high since they're on the main chain.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:46:47
I'm interested in knowing who would pay to open and close the channels if you and I were to open one between the two of us.

They seem to be the same. [Segwit wallet on the left.](

What do you mean by


@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:09
Where do I get those?
Edit: I tried to scan that but it says "Channel capacity must be between 1 and 167 mBTC".

How do I connect to a channel on the eclair app?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:33:03
I've done that now it says I need to add channels. How do I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:44
Ohhhhhhh. I feel dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:44:48
Well this may as well be rocket science for me :).

Consider me illeterate. How do I get the book from that link?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:01
I've got the coins, how do I go about setting the capacity? The eclair wallet is quite minimalistic and I don't see many options.

I think Electrum's segwit doesn't work.

How do you get abstract from 19981101
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:24:30
my bad
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:30:01
Yeah, how's that helpful?
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:56:27
How did you calculate this?
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:25:39
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:49:05
end isn't on the BIP39 list

How would you get the order from the log?
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:06:56
Do you have all text in the image typed out?
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:24:13
What do you mean coordinate?

But are these closed/paid wallets offering anything special to justify their price/closeness?
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:36:52
What kind of service does a paid wallet provide?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:16:17
I understand what open-source is. My question was about the closed wallets and what they had to offer for someone to pay for it since there are open alternatives.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:11:03
Meaning?
