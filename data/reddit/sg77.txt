When reading another transcript, I was wondering why there was no attribution; that note about Chatham House rules explains it.  But is there a way to tell when one speaker stops and another starts?  Is a whole paragraph spoken by one person, and the next paragraph is spoken by someone else?  Or is there no general rule, and sometimes each sentence in a paragraph was said by a different person?

 doesn't specifically mention hot or cold.  It says "an amount that exceeds the average value of digital currency it holds online at any given time" which I guess means the amount is similar to the amount in the hot wallet.  So, if coins were stolen from cold storage (e.g., employee theft), would that also be covered (up to a certain amount)?

For people wondering about withdrawing and depositing bitcoin from/to Robinhood, see their FAQ: 
They will allow withdrawing crypto, but only if you go through a verification process (send them pictures of two IDs, bank statements, and a selfie).
They'll make you pay the mining fee for withdrawals (we don't know yet how high of a fee they'll use).
They don't allow deposits of crypto (but might in the future).
People should probably also read the rest of their FAQ:

You could try Gemini.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:57:03
Another option is to use Gemini; they let you buy up to $500 immediately (just can't withdraw the bitcoin until the bank deposit posts a few days later).  But it might take a while for Gemini to approve your account, so this might not help you if you don't already have a Gemini account, but you could try it.  Also, if your bank isn't one that Gemini has support for, you need to do a wire transfer to set up the bank link (for the supported banks you can use ACH transfers which are easier).

Their [FAQ]( says "we display the best available price on Robinhood Crypto, which is based on the exchanges we connect to", so to me it sounds like they will use multiple exchanges, not be an exchange themselves.
But your question about how they will avoid fees is a good one.  Maybe they'll just include the exchange's fee in the price they show you.  Or possibly they'll eat the fees and hope that they make enough money in other ways to make up for it, which I guess is a similar model to what they do for stocks:

Yes, you can link a bank by entering the routing &amp; account numbers and verifying 2 small deposits after a couple days (the interface for this is only in the mobile app, not their website):  (scroll down to "Manual" on that page)

@_date: 2018-01-15 05:44:39
Even if Coinbase/GDAX gives you a report that treats your transfer as a sale, they're not sending that report to the IRS; it's just informational for you.
Maybe at some point the IRS will force Coinbase to give them the info; but even then, my understanding is that the transfer to your own wallet isn't taxable.  If the IRS assumes by default that all transfers are sales, then you might need to submit info to them saying that the transfer wasn't a sale.
Or, some people may want to treat the transfer as a sale, so that they can avoid paying higher taxes later when they actually sell, but I'm guessing the IRS wouldn't like that.

Have you also tested that addresses generated this way work properly in Electrum, e.g., have you received bitcoin at one of these addresses, and then sent from that address?
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:12:52
The seeds generated by Electrum still aren't BIP39.  But if you enter a non-BIP39 seed from Electrum into Electrum and select "BIP39 seed", it still lets you restore a wallet; it just shows a warning: "BIP39 (checksum: failed)".
From what I remember, the checksum in BIP39 is just used as a way to tell you that a word is wrong, but the address generation is just based on the string of words, and can give you addresses even if the checksum is wrong (and I think even if the words aren't from the BIP39 word list).  (But some software might refuse to continue if the checksum is wrong; e.g., the iancoleman bip39 site.)

When I try to add cash to my account, I get "This transfer failed".  Anyone know what that means?
Right before that, I scanned my Driver License; do I need to wait for them to approve it?  (If so, they're not very good at communicating the status.  I've also heard of cases where Square suddenly closes someone's account (not related to buying BTC; just in general).  It'll be nice for Coinbase to have competition, but Square might turn out to be just as bad.)

But does the Cash Card let you spend from your BTC balance, or only from your Cash balance?

It might've been HitBTC charging you a "deposit fee": 
(Though, that says their deposit fee is 0.0003 BTC, not 0.0006 that you seem to have been charged.  And  and  say "no fee" for deposits, but maybe they forgot to update those pages.)

This could possibly change in the future though: 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:39:33
Your xpub is probably also on your computer (that you connect the Nano S to), e.g., wallet software such as Electrum or a web interface gets the xpub from the hardware wallet so that it can display your addresses.
Though, the issue with xpub + private key only applies to addresses within the same account, so you might be safe if you move the BTC to an address in a different account under the same seed.  (At least, that's what I get from reading BIP32 and some articles; I don't know all the math behind it.)
Another risk is on the computer where you use the iancoleman bip39 site, exposing your seed words.  But I guess you would do that on an offline computer, that ideally never goes online again.

It might be a bug in what they display as Total before making the trade.  Did you actually make the trade and see whether they charge you?
If I specify a Limit Buy of 0.1 BTC at $14000, it says Total $1400 with Post Only, $1403.50 without Post Only.  That makes sense (charging you for a Taker order).
But for a Limit Sell of 0.1 BTC at $14000, it says Total $1400 with Post Only, $1403.50 without Post Only.  That seems wrong; I think it should subtract $3.50.  (And, at the current price, this wouldn't be a Taker order anyway; but the Total it shows before a trade is just an estimate anyway; the market price might be different when you actually place the order).

If your bank isn't listed, you won't be able to use the login method to link the account, but you can still link it with a different method that sends small deposits to your account which you then verify (though it takes a couple days).  Their interface for this seems to have a problem though, that when I search for "provident" it just shows two "Providence Bank" choices and doesn't give any other option; but if you type some garbage like "providentasdf" then a button will appear saying "Link your bank manually".  Use that.
(Or you can do a wire transfer from your bank, but the bank probably charges you for that and it's probably annoying to set up.)

Gemini doesn't have a mobile app.  I guess you're talking about Authy, for 2FA?  I think you can also use SMS (text messages), but that's not as secure.  You can run Authy on a desktop computer; that might be the best approach for you.

Two days after I signed up, I got a notification "Your Cash Card has been approved."  I then tried adding cash to my account, and this time it worked.  So, maybe the error I got before was due to them not approving my Cash Card yet.
(It's not clear to me whether enabling the Cash Card is a necessary step for buying BTC.  When I first signed up for Square Cash, the BTC option didn't appear.  I enabled the Cash Card, and one day after that the BTC option appeared (but adding money to my account gave an error until one more day after that).)
I bought some BTC to try it out.  It gave me a price 2.4% higher than GDAX.  (If I then were to sell, it offers me a price 0.5% lower than GDAX.)
Though, adding cash for the purchase was instant, from a debit card rather than waiting for an ACH bank transfer to post, so they're really competing with Coinbase, which has worse prices than GDAX.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:01:27
I don't know.  I guess you could try removing the debit card and then try adding the bank again.

As someone else said, if you use Electrum with your Trezor you can select specific coins to send from (in Electrum, View-&gt;Show Coins to enable the Coins tab).
But also, if you just send your whole balance (with either the Trezor Wallet website or with Electrum), all of your addresses will be used as inputs; so that's an easy way to make all of your addresses active.  (Though if you have some addresses that just recently received BTC (too late to claim UB), so you don't want to send from those now, this method isn't as good since you'd pay a higher fee if using more addresses as inputs.)

Coinbase already has a delay before sending transactions, sometimes taking several hours (this is before they even broadcast the transaction on the network; e.g., if they have to retrieve coins from cold storage, or if they have a rate limit to reduce the impact of hacks).  So, batching transactions might not even cause an additional delay.  And having a batch every few minutes isn't a big delay anyway.
(GDAX might have less of a delay than Coinbase.  But still, they could batch GDAX tranasactions more frequently, like every 1 minute vs. every 5 minutes for Coinbase.)

The BTC price they show you on the screen with the chart is different than the price they give you for buys &amp; sells, which is worse.  The price they gave me for buying was 2.4% higher than GDAX.

Basically, there are two types of segwit addresses.  Electrum gives you a new type starting with bc1, but there's a way to make it give you the old type starting with 3 (you'll have to create a new wallet though).  Or, most other wallet software that support segwit currently use the type that starts with 3, so you could switch from Electrum to a different wallet.
(The bc1 style (bech32) can give even cheaper fees than the 3 style, but bc1 is very new and a lot of services don't support sending to it yet.)

Electrum has both desktop &amp; mobile wallets (you only have it listed as Mobile).
Electrum can also give you P2SH segwit addresses, when used with a hardware wallet, or when entering seed words as described in   
But, I didn't see a way to do that in the mobile version of Electrum, only desktop.
Does your BECH32 column mean support for sending to bech32 addresses, or does it mean that the wallet gives you bech32 addresses for receiving?  You might want two columns.  (Electrum can do both; I don't know about the others)

For banks not included in Gemini's list, you can do a wire transfer from your bank to Gemini.  And after that, Gemini will allow you to do ACH transfers from that bank.  If the bank charges you a fee for wire transfers, Gemini will reimburse you (at least, they have in the past, if you ask them) up to $20 (only for the first wire transfer you do, for banks that they don't support directly).

Trezor isn't affected, in the sense that your private keys couldn't be stolen.  But, it's affected in other ways (when using Trezor with old versions of Electrum): someone could see which addresses belong to you, hurting your privacy; or they could change a destination address when you send a transaction (but hopefully you would notice that when confirming the transaction on the Trezor screen).

It says "agianst the last transaction found in the last block", but it seems to be a couple blocks behind (and there's a typo: "agianst"), e.g., the last block was 502116 but your site looks at 502114.
The basic idea is it just looks at the cheapest transaction in a recent block?  But if it doesn't look at the current mempool, the estimate might not be very good.
(And block 502114 was strange; one 46 sat/B transaction somehow got in (someone using a miner's accelerator?) but that was much lower than other transactions that were in the mempool and that were in the next block.)

One basic way: if you withdraw BTC from Coinbase and then look at the transaction and see that it came from an address starting with 1, or you deposit BTC into Coinbase and they tell you to send to an address starting with 1, then they're not using segwit at all.  (Segwit addresses start with 3 or bc1.  Note though that starting with 3 could also mean that it's P2SH/multisig, not segwit.  But addresses starting with 1 are definitely not segwit.)

Yes, I agree it's not taxable.  But the IRS doesn't know where the bitcoin went when you sent it out of Coinbase, so they may default to assuming that you sold it, and the taxpayer would then need to convince the IRS that they didn't sell it.
Here's discussion of a similar situation for stock sales: 
"The IRS issues a Form CP2000 stating that shares of stock were sold and provides the taxpayer with an estimate of the taxes owed. If no action is taken, the IRS assumes that there is no cost basis and that the stock or mutual funds were purchased for nothing!"

Though, some other exchanges aren't any better (but some like GDAX don't charge anything for withdrawal fees; though, they don't support many altcoins).
In general, it's better to send a large chunk of BTC from the exchange to your own wallet.  Then for future transactions you send from your wallet, you have more control over the fees you pay.

I would also add a passphrase, so that if someone finds your seed words, they can't access your wallet.

Also check your Coinbase account balances.  Withdrawals from GDAX go through Coinbase internally, and I heard of a case where someone's withdrawal from GDAX had a problem, and they found the missing coin on Coinbase.

Replay isn't an issue for Bitcore, because they didn't do a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain; they did an airdrop that sent BTX to addresses that held BTC.  Even though the BTX &amp; BTC addresses are the same, different transactions sent BTX/BTC to those addresses.  When you send BTX/BTC, you're sending from the outputs of the previous transactions; so your transaction sending BTX will look different than a transaction sending BTC from the same address, so replaying the BTX transaction on the BTC network wouldn't work.
Though, if you're entering your BTC private keys or seed words into other wallet software to access BTX, then yeah, you'd probably want to move BTC to a new seed first, in case the wallet is malicious and uses your private keys to steal your BTC.  (If you're using a hardware wallet to send BTX, this shouldn't be an issue, but you could still move the BTC first to be safe.)
But related to this thread, Coinomi seems to be broken currently for Bitcore (not updating balance, at least for me), so you may want to use a different method to access Bitcore.

I think this is meant more for the case that you're doing a large number of small transactions.  e.g., if you do 100,000 transactions of 0.1 satoshis, then the total of the probabilistic payments will be very close to the expected amount.
Also, if 1 satoshi becomes worth a nontrivial amount, bitcoin itself could be modified to allow smaller amounts in on-chain transactions.

One issue is that the IRS is asking for buys/sends/receives in addition to sells.  A lot of people didn't sell any bitcoin (and thus didn't make any income from it yet), just bought it and sent it to their own wallet.  The IRS will probably send thousands of people letters saying they owe taxes and penalties, even when no tax is really owed due to no sells happening yet.  There's probably some way to tell the IRS their info is wrong (and provide proof that you still hold the bitcoin?), but it could cause headaches for a lot of people.

Maybe exchanges should start quoting BTC prices per bit or per mBTC instead of per 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:04:29
Get one of each.  An advantage of having two is that you can use the same seed on both, giving you an easy way to check that you can recover from the seed words without the risk of losing your coins.  And if there's a hardware failure, you'll have a backup ready.  And if one of them adds support for a fork/coin before the other, you'll have access to it quickly.

Gemini doesn't support withdrawals to bc1 addresses yet (neither does GDAX).  So I guess you mean an address starting with 3; but in that case, it should work from GDAX already.

USD deposits on GDAX have FDIC insurance up to $250,000.

Sometimes when Coinbase cancels a transaction, they withdraw the money from your bank and later refund the money to you.  In my case (a while ago), the cancellation email said "you will receive a refund to your bank account in 3-4 business days".
You'll probably get a refund from Coinbase in a couple days, to cover most of the negative balance.  I would talk to both your bank and to Coinbase and ask if they could refund the NSF fees (they might not, but worth a try).

FYI, Square Cash now lets you deposit BTC.  One drawback of Square Cash is their limits for depositing USD: $2,500 per week (for withdraws the limit is $25,000 per week); and a limit of $10,000 BTC purchases per week, and BTC withdrawal limits of $2,000 per day &amp; $5,000 per week.  Also, their spread can be a bigger deal than in your example if you're buying large amounts; 1% of $100 is only $1, but for $10,000 you're paying around $100 more than Coinbase Pro.  (But still cheaper than regular Coinbase, and may make sense for smaller purchases. Edit: or if you want to buy instantly without waiting for a USD deposit.)

It'd also be useful to know which exchanges support sending to bech32 addresses (native segwit addresses that start with bc1), and whether they can receive transactions sent from bech32 addresses (that direction should automatically work at the protocol level, but some services could have problems with it, and someone posted that they had a problem with Coinbase (with a merchant that was using Coinbase to process the payment)).

Another option is to use the same seed in both, i.e., use both to access the same wallet.  This can be useful when there's a fork; you get quick access to the forked coins, regardless of whether Ledger or Trezor adds support for the fork first.

That's not how it works.  When you send from that address, you're really sending from the outputs of each previous transaction that went into that address.  Each of those outputs that you use as an input increases the size of the transaction, and the fee is based on the size.  So there's no benefit from using the same address vs. different addresses.

What error do you get from BackupUtil.java?  If it's "the supplied password did not match the checksum of the encrypted key", you could try modifying bitlib/src/main/java/com/mrd/bitlib/crypto/MrdExport.java, removing the "Verify checksum" part of decryptPrivateKey, so that it'll print the private key even if the checksum doesn't match.
I doubt that'd help, but there's a slight chance that it actually decrypted properly and just the checksum is messed up.
Also, if you compare the top of your old backup PDF to the new one that you created yesterday as a test, are there any differences, like in the "Backup Format" version, "Active Records", etc?  I don't know if it matters, but maybe a difference there would give a clue about the problem.

For regular Limit orders on GDAX, you need to select "Post Only" under Advanced, if you want to ensure that it will only be a Maker order, rather than Taker.

What exact error does the app give?  If I mistype a password such that the checksum isn't valid, I get "The checksum is invalid."  If the checksum is valid but the password is wrong to decrypt the backup, I get "Invalid Password The password you entered is not valid."
If you get the second error, then you're probably not making a mistake typing the password.  If you've backed up multiple wallets, maybe you're accidentally using a password for a different wallet.
Something else you could try is generating a new Single Address Account, create a backup PDF, and try restoring from that backup, to check that the process is working in general.

If you scan the other QR code on the page, showing the public bitcoin address, does that give you the balance you expect?  (as another check that you're using the right backup PDF)
Also note that even if you only ever had one wallet, if you created a second backup PDF, it gives you a different password and different encrypted key.  Possibly you're using the password from one backup but the PDF from a different backup of the same wallet.

Some advantages of Coinbase (at least, a few months ago; not sure if they've changed):
* You can cancel a bitcoin buy in the first 5 minutes or so (e.g., if the price dropped a lot right after your purchase, or if you made a mistake); I think they allow 2 cancels per week.
* I think you're guaranteed to get the quoted price, or if the price changes, they'll ask you to confirm you still want to buy; vs. Circle, where the price may change and you don't find out until after the purchase, when you see they gave you only 0.996 BTC instead of 1 BTC (but occasionally it works in your favor and you get 1.001 BTC, etc).
* Coinbase has vault features for more security (though, you could also transfer BTC there from somewhere else, or transfer BTC from either Coinbase/Circle to another wallet).
* Coinbase has a higher limit (dollar amount per day/week that you can purchase) than Circle.  (Though, Coinbase's Identity Verification to get the highest level has never worked for me; but even the level below that is higher than Circle's, except if you need to get BTC instantly, Circle's limit is a little higher unless you get Coinbase's highest ID Verification level.)
But Circle's price has been a little bit better than Coinbase's every time I've checked (after including Coinbase's 1% fee, and for Circle assuming that you're using a bank account, not credit/debit card).  e.g., Circle is currently $325.55 for 1 BTC, vs. $326.68 at Coinbase (so Circle is 0.35% cheaper).
I've been using Circle mostly, to get the lower price, but Coinbase's benefits could be worth a slightly higher price for some people. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:13:29
In my case, 16% of the time, Circle gave me slightly more BTC than I asked for.  So it might really be random fluctuations in the exchange rate like they claim.  But it's a little strange that the difference more frequently benefits Circle than the user.
Circle's FAQ, for "How is my deposit BTC-USD exchange rate locked?" says "
We strive to honor as-close-to the exchange rate that you see on Circle!
 
When the transaction is processed by Circle's server, your exchange rate is locked. Right now, this can be slightly different from the exact exchange that you see on the confirmation page, as there is a very slight delay before processing.
 
If there is a slight difference, it will be locked to the USD value of that transaction. For example, if I deposit $30 worth of bitcoin and the exchange rate changes slightly before the transaction is processed, the amount of bitcoin that I get for $30 may be slightly different."
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:25:42
I just tried it, and I was still able to cancel it within 5 minutes.
In the transaction list it showed as "pending", and I clicked to view the Buy Details, and there was a Cancel button.
Maybe if you clicked through to the Buy Details, it would've let you cancel.  Or possibly it's different for instant buys or buys from the USD wallet, vs. a regular buy that takes 4 days (which is what I was doing).

I think he means this:
But for the initial deposit into the USD wallet, you need to wait 2-3 days for the ACH to finish before you can buy BTC, right?  (Then after that, the BTC buy from the USD wallet is instant)
So it's a little closer to an exchange, but still without features such as limit orders.  But Coinbase says their USD wallet is FDIC-insured, which a lot of exchanges probably don't have.
(Also, USD wallet requires identity verification on Coinbase, which doesn't work for some people.)

So, that creates an arbitrage opportunity, where people buy ETF shares and then redeem them to get 2 coins, which they sell for more than they paid.  As more people do this, the gap between the prices gets smaller (market price of the ETF goes up (premium over the NAV), or the coin prices go down).  The net effect is that the ETF price eventually equals the total value of both coins.

I guess the reason is that you want to be able to set a limit order to buy at a certain price, or doing a lot of trading back and forth?
Buttercoin could be a good choice, since they're in the US and are backed by some big venture capital money; that makes me think they're not likely to run away with your money.  Though, they're new, and I don't think they have insurance for the USD/bitcoin in your account (last I heard, they were looking into insurance; do any exchanges have it?).
I'd like to be able to set a limit order to buy bitcoin without needing to hold USD in the account; when the order is triggered, the USD would be ACH'd from my bank account.  Currently Buttercoin doesn't have a way to do that.  Maybe Coinbase/Circle could add limit orders.

Actually, Circle sometimes doesn't give you the same price you agreed to when clicking the BUY button.  e.g., if the price is $300 for 1 BTC when you click the button, but then the price goes up to $301 before Circle processes it, they'll only give you 0.997 BTC.  (This seems to violate Circle's user agreement?)  But that should be a small difference, and doesn't sound like the issue in this case.
In this case, the problem might've been that he was above the limit for instant buys, so he has to wait a few days for the deposit to finish; so he may have gotten the correct amount of BTC, that was worth $200 when he initiated the buy, but is now worth less since the BTC price went down.
Though, he says there was a "system error", so it's possible that the issue here was something else.  If his buy was supposed to be instant, or it was non-instant but was supposed to take 3 days but instead took 6 days, i.e., Circle messed up, then the right answer is less clear.  Their response still might be reasonable, but maybe falls short of what would be expected if they had excellent customer service.

one advantage of bitcoin is it allows people to recieve tips without having a changetip account or even knowing what changetip is
Though, I think you do have a point, that to send a tip via bitcoin directly, the recipient needs to have previously said what their bitcoin address is; vs. changetip (or some other middle man) that lets you leave a tip for someone to pick up even if they never announced a way to pay them.
Or is there any way that can be done directly with bitcoin?  You could send someone a private key.  There's no guarantee that you didn't keep the private key; they'd have to trust that you won't take the money back before they spend it.  But is that any different than trusting changetip to not steal the money?
Another thing that's not clear to me: what does changetip have to do with bitcoin?  Couldn't changetip use paypal (or ACH to bank accounts, etc) instead of bitcoin for deposits/withdrawals, and still be basically the same service?

I think a benefit of Coinbase vs. GDAX is that Coinbase lets you buy bitcoin without first depositing USD (i.e., without waiting several days for an ACH deposit to finish; you still can't use the bitcoin until after the ACH finishes (except for small amounts), but you get the price at the time that you initiated the purchase (unless Coinbase randomly cancels your order).
Also, GDAX seems to have stricter/different requirements for identity verification; some people can get verified on Coinbase but not GDAX.

When I plug in the Trezor, I need to enter that PIN.  The Trezor's screen shows the numbers in a random order, and on my computer I click on the positions in the matrix that correspond to the numbers of the PIN that I previously set up.
A clarification: signing a transaction doesn't necessarily require entering a PIN, if the PIN was entered less than 10 minutes ago (it does still require pressing a button on the Trezor, so you still need physical access); so, if you entered the PIN and then walked away from your computer and left the Trezor plugged in, if an attacker uses your computer quickly (and is physically there), they can sign a transaction without entering the PIN.

@_date: 2017-01-11 21:18:44
I didn't mean pre-computed the block, but rather, with the actual current transactions, they on-the-fly found a nonce and a few dummy transactions that would give a block hash equal to the value they said in the video.  i.e., similar to the normal mining process, but instead of just finding a hash with the right number of zeros, they found a hash with every digit matching the value they want; so they have an extremely huge amount of hashpower, or used quantum computing, or used advanced math to break the hashing algorithm.
Actually, they didn't need to match ALL the digits... Julian didn't read them all...

I think it's the opposite.  If Bitmain convinces people that they're only a small part of Antpool, then they could say that there's a bunch of other people who agree with them (since those other people did not move to another pool); and they probably want people to think that mining is less centralized than it really is.
Also, even if the 25,000 number is correct, note that the quote says "continuously mining for Bitcoin". They could have many other miners that switch between BCH and BTC, with only a small portion mining only BTC.  Or they could have other miners that they turn on or off depending on profitability, so they could claim that those are not "continuously mining".

I think that's a decent argument, though this seems to change the risk a little: even if you trust the two exchanges you're using and they're good, if enough of the other exchanges in the federation are bad, they could collude to steal from the good exchanges (or at least censor their transactions?).

Is that for transactions on Liquid, or transactions between LBTC and BTC?  If one exchange wants to go from LBTC back to BTC, can a large group of other exchanges block it? And could a large group of exchanges exit from LBTC to a BTC address that they control, cutting out the other exchanges?

I don't think the cost basis is the problem (unless Coinbase does something silly like saying they know the basis when they really don't).  The problem would be if they report transfers out to your own wallet as sales.  With 1099 forms from stock brokerages, that situation isn't common; they don't say you sold something that you really didn't.

For Trezor you don't install separate apps on the device for each coin; there's just one firmware that has support for all the coins.  (In some cases you need to update the firmware to get support for a new coin, but that new firmware has support for all the old coins too.)  To switch between coins, there's a pulldown menu on the TREZOR Wallet website.  (For Ethereum, you need to use the MyEtherWallet website instead.)
Though, I think Ledger supports more altcoins.  You can see the coins that Trezor supports at  (the table at the bottom).  Trezor 2, which is planned to be released later this year, is supposed to make it easier for new altcoins to be supported.

The pages below have more info about how passphrases work.  I think they call it "passphrase" instead of "password" because it can be multiple words, not just one word.
Also, to clarify "private key": the recovery seed words actually generate multiple private keys and corresponding public keys, from which addresses are derived.  Each time you receive bitcoins, the TREZOR Wallet will give you a new address to use next time (the previous address would still work too, but it's recommended to not reuse addresses).  If your TREZOR gets destroyed, or you switch to another brand of wallet, you can enter the seed words and regenerate all the same addresses.

For some people it probably depends on which exchange they used.  If you're trading BTC on GDAX, to whom you gave your social security number, ID, etc, then I think it's likely that the IRS will be told about your trades (not right away, but the IRS is trying to get info from Coinbase, and maybe in the future they'll issue a Form 1099).  If you're using an unregulated exchange that doesn't have your ID, it's less likely that the IRS will know about it.

If you want to use wire transfers: you can do a wire transfer each time (but your bank will probably charge you around $30 each time).
If you want to use ACH: If your bank is included in the list of banks that Gemini has special support for, you can set it up by entering your bank username/password (a few banks let you set up a guest account, if you don't want to enter your regular account password).  If your bank isn't in that list, then you first need to do a wire transfer to Gemini to prove you own the bank account (I've heard Gemini will you reimburse you $20 for this one-time wire transfer); after that's set up, you can do ACH transfers.

Bittrex has an Auto-Sell feature, though it uses a market order rather than limit order (and it seems to only go from x to BTC): "Auto-Sell is a feature that automatically sells any currency you specify into Bitcoin. We primarily see this as a convenience for mining pools and large scale miners to convert their coins. Every 10 seconds, we check your balance. If you have more than the minimum trade size, we market sell your coin for Bitcoin. Any coins you have in your balance will get sold if the auto-sell option is enabled in that currency, whether you have a balance due to a trade or a deposit. The price your currency is sold at is dependant on the market price at the time it was sold. The standard trade fees apply."

Coinbase doesn't let you change the fee (and the fee they pick is probably a lot higher than is really necessary (which does make it likely to get into a block quickly)).
But GDAX (which is also run by Coinbase) charges $0 for bitcoin withdrawals (they pay the network fee for you).  So, you should be able to log in to GDAX and move your bitcoin from Coinbase into GDAX and then withdraw from there.

Recent firmware (starting with 1.5.1 I think) includes a way to verify the seed.  I think it's basically like the recovery process, where you enter the seed words, but instead of wiping the device and giving you a new wallet based on the words you entered, it just tells you whether the seed matches the current wallet.
(But so far it can only be used via their Python interface at a command line; they might add it to the web interface later.)

Does it really require new seed words?  I think that would annoy a lot of people; if someone stored their old seed words in multiple physical locations as backups, they're not going to want to change them.
Maybe they could have a way to create a new segwit wallet from the same seed words as an existing wallet.
Or maybe they could show both segwit and legacy addresses in the same wallet, similar to what TREZOR does:  (but they implement it similar to multiple accounts, which maybe Electrum doesn't have an easy interface for)
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:21:19
They do document this: 
"Your exchange rate for buying or selling digital currency through our Conversion Service is calculated as the market rate of the digital currency on Coinbase’s GDAX platform, plus a spread of up to 50 basis points".
You could instead deposit directly into GDAX via ACH for no fee (but that has the drawback that you have to wait several days for the ACH to post before you can trade with the deposited money).

Probably not soon, but Coinbase left open the possibility that at some point they may let users withdraw BCH.  e.g., the FAQ below uses language like "We do not plan ... at this time" and "Coinbase does not intend to support or interact with the new blockchain in any way. If this were to change, Coinbase would make those coins available for customers to withdraw, not keep them."
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:15:35
Based on their blog, you should still be able to send BCH from Trezor to an external address using their claim tool, even though they temporarily disabled the regular wallet interface for BCH.  
Some people are still complaining on twitter; it's not clear to me if they didn't read the blog yet, or if there's also problems with sending to external addresses.

Gemini, if you ask them to enable ActiveTrader: 0.25% maker fee (0.35% taker), and they support ACH.  You can trade immediately after an ACH deposit but can't withdraw until the ACH settles (that applies to Binance.US too).

Ledger supports both ways.  You can tie your passphrase to a second PIN, in which case your passphrase is stored in the device.  Or you can enter the passphrase each time you want to use it, in which case the passphrase is not stored in the device.  Also, the secure element in the Ledger should make it difficult to extract the passphrase from it.  But, closed source means we don't know if Ledger is really doing what they claim, and there's a chance that the secure element could have bugs or backdoors.  Entering the passphrase on Ledger using its two buttons is kind of a pain; Trezor's method of entering it on a computer is easier, though has other risks; Trezor T allowing the passphrase to be entered on its touchscreen might be good.

I'm not sure what logic is used by the estimator sites like estimatefee.com (or Bitcoin Core itself, which I think that site uses), but I think one issue is that they might not even look at the current mempool, but rather they just look at an average based on recent blocks (there was a talk at the recent Scaling Bitcoin conference about improving this, but people need time to implement it).  And in general, I guess they want to give kinda conservative estimates, in case more transactions with higher fees suddenly appear and push out your transaction.
You can see in the graph that 10 sat/B was good for a few blocks a couple hours ago, and good 20 minutes ago, but there were also spikes up to 160 or 140 around 1 hour ago, and right now it's up to 100.  So picking 10 would've been too low sometimes.  Though, even if it didn't get into the next block, it probably would've within 3 blocks.

Rather than looking at the number of transactions, I would look at the size, since the limit per block is on size (1 MB), and transactions can be different sizes depending on how many inputs, etc they have.
At  in the bottom graph (Mempool Size in MB), click on 10-20 on the left to remove some clutter from the graph (removes the &lt; 10 sat/B fees).  Hovering the mouse over recent peaks in the graph, in the table that appears I look for the lowest fees that were under the limit of 1 MB.  e.g., at a recent peak, transactions with 10+ sat/B fees took up 0.868 MB, so if I had made a transaction at that time with a 10 sat/B fee, it probably would've made it into that block.
But using that info to estimate the fee you should pay now is harder, since the size of the mempool can change quickly.  For the last hour or so, 10 sat/B fee probably would've been good.  But right now, I see 160+ 0.974 MB, 140+ 1.178 MB.  So I guess a fee around 160 sat/B would be needed now to get into the next block (but it's possible that more transactions at higher fees will come in before the next block, making 160 too low).   currently recommends 189 sat/byte.

I guess you're talking about something like Coinbase, which is more of a broker than an exchange.  Coinbase may buy chunks of bitcoin and then sell it to their users, but on a real exchange (such as GDAX) users are trading with other users.  Coinbase's prices follow GDAX's prices.  Or, services like Shapeshift probably follow the prices on various exchanges.

Electrum 3, which was just recently released, supports SegWit with hardware wallets.  I think it should be possible to sign a transaction on an offline computer using Electrum with Trezor (but I haven't tried it).
Also, even if the Trezor Wallet website requires you to update firmware, you could keep using old firmware with Electrum.
For some protection against malicious firmware, you can compare the firmware fingerprint, shown on the Trezor screen by the bootloader during a firmware update, to the expected fingerprint for firmware built from the open source code.  Even if you don't build the open source code yourself, other people could build it and publicly post the fingerprint.  An old post related to this: 
The bootloader can also be compared to the open source code, by running custom firmware that reads the bootloader, as discussed in   (though, probably most people won't do this; but maybe the fact that some people will do it is enough to keep the manufacturer honest)
Edit: another way to check the bootloader:

I think the difference between the Dashboard and Buy/Sell pages is due to this (on that Coinbase support page I linked): "Your exchange rate for buying or selling digital currency through our Conversion Service is calculated as the market rate of the digital currency on Coinbase’s GDAX platform, plus a spread between 25 to 100 basis points".
25 to 100 basis points is 0.25% to 1%.  It seems that the Dashboard shows the same price as GDAX.  The Buy/Sell page shows the price after adding the 0.25% to 1% spread.  Then when you click "Buy Bitcoin" they add the 1.49% fee, and they show you the Total cost before you click Confirm Buy.
(I agree that Coinbase is confusing and their fees are excessive.  But GDAX is decent.)
The $10 fee you're talking about might be for depositing USD into Coinbase via wire transfer (if you choose that instead of an ACH transfer); but that's separate from the fee for buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:26:21
I just checked; on Coinbase's screen where I need to click "Confirm Buy", it shows 1 BTC $10798.74, Fee $160.90, Total $10959.64.  That fee matches the 1.49% rate they show at

Yes, but the optional passphrase can only be typed into a computer with the original Trezor.  (It's probably rare that you'd have malware watching your passphrase AND the same person knowing your seed or having the physical device + PIN, but still it's probably more secure to enter the passphrase directly on the device.)

Even the Nano S requires a third-party site (myetherwallet.com, same thing that Trezor uses) for ERC20 tokens.  And myetherwallet.com is a website, not something you need to install on your computer.  But yeah, if you're just dealing with plain ETH, Nano S might be easier than Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:02:23
Don't select "Create a new seed".  Select "Use a hardware device".  After asking you to enter the PIN, it'll ask for Derivation; instead of the default m/44'/0'/0', enter m/49'/0'/0' to get segwit addresses.
(Electrum 2.9 also allowed you to enter the derivation path, but to actually get segwit addresses this only works with the new Electrum 3.0)
Also, for anyone wondering, when using Electrum 3.0 with a hardware wallet with m/49'/0'/0' the segwit addresses are the P2SH style that start with 3 (i.e., the same address that the Trezor/Ledger wallet gives you), not the bech32 "bc1" addresses that Electrum is using for software segwit wallets.

For  I think even more important than the PIN &amp; recovery seed (which Trezor 1 already has ways of entering without revealing them to the computer), is the passphrase (which currently must be typed into the computer).

If you add a passphrase, then knowing the PIN isn't enough.  (Without the passphrase (or with a wrong passphrase), someone would see a wallet (which you could put a small amount of BTC in as a decoy), and they won't know that you have another wallet with the passphrase.)

If you use a passphrase, entering it on the device (via touchscreen) is probably more secure than typing it into a computer.  They also said something about the device not communicating with the computer until after you enter your PIN, to be more secure.

Nano S also has PIN entry on the device (using the two buttons to increase or decrease each digit).  Recovery seed is also entered on the device with the two buttons (kinda a pain though).
For passphrase, does Ledger Blue support it at all?   says "This feature is not available for the Ledger Blue device."  (Though maybe that page is out of date.)   sounds like passphrase support would be added to the firmware eventually, but I don't know if that's happened yet.

Where did you originally get the 12 seed words from?  Mycelium?  And did you originally do something like the last link I posted, to get a passphrase added to the wallet in Mycelium?
Or did the 12 words come from a different wallet, like Electrum?
And did you only use one "account" in the wallet, or multiple accounts?  In Mycelium you can add more accounts (on Accounts tab, tap the icon with a key and plus sign, then "Add HD Account"); restoring those accounts might show your old coins, if you had used those accounts before.

(I'm assuming you don't have any bitcoin currently in your Mycelium app; if you do, be sure that you have the backup seed words for that wallet before you uninstall the app, or use a different phone.)

To expand on what other people said already... Coinbase isn't good to use as a wallet for sending small transactions.  Besides the high fees, Coinbase sometimes has random delays that can last multiple hours before they'll send your transaction.  Instead, once you purchase a chunk of bitcoin on Coinbase (or GDAX, etc which are cheaper), send that bitcoin to your own wallet where you control the private keys.  Then you can later send from that wallet immediately and have control over the fees you pay for each transaction.

The Coinbase Pro fee is 0.5% (or less if your 30-day trading volume is $10k or higher).  Cash App's fee seems to be 1.78% (at least, for the amounts I just tried).  Sometimes the market price is a little higher or lower on Coinbase Pro, but I think it's unlikely that the price is higher by a big enough amount to overcome the fee difference.
The way Coinbase Pro displays market orders is confusing, but I think when you enter $100 amount, and it says $0.50 fee, that means total after fee is $100 (so, $99.50 before fee); vs. on Cash App when you enter $100, it adds the fee to that, making the total $101.78.  If I enter $101.78 on Coinbase Pro, the BTC amount you get is higher than Cash App gives you.  Or, enter a limit order (instead of market) on Coinbase Pro, specifying the limit price the same as the exchange rate shown by Cash App, and the BTC amount the same as Cash App will give you, and see the total price after fee is $100.50 on CB Pro vs. $101.78 Cash App.
But, there are other exchanges with lower fees than both of those.  e.g., see the table in the picture at  (actually, Gemini is lower than shown there if you ask them to give you the ActiveTrader interface).  But if you're depositing fiat, some of those exchanges only support wire transfers; but some of them support ACH transfers too.

Here's my attempt at explaining it: 
(But it still involves some guessing, or picking a fee that might be higher than really needed, since you don't know what other transactions are going to appear before the next block is found.

I don't know exactly what triggers the bitcoin option to appear, but try filling out all your info in the app, including your phone number.  I also signed up for the Cash Card (debit card), which asked for my address, SSN last 4, birthdate, and signature to show on the card.
One day after I did that (which was two days after I initially signed up for Square), the BTC option appeared.  At the top of the main screen, it says "Cash &amp; BTC" (vs. before it just said something like "Cash").

His opinion seems to be that it's ok if bitcoin fails, because we can then switch to a different coin that does things differently; and he thinks quick adoption by everyone in the world is worth the risk.  Maybe there's some truth to those views, but I think people will be discouraged from investing in and building infrastructure for the current coin, if it can easily disappear and isn't secure.
Both sides kinda want the same end result, but their priorities are different.  Decentralization is what makes bitcoin unique, so keeping that as a priority seems like a good idea.  Once something becomes too centralized, it may be very difficult to recover from, since the people in control can make changes to give them even more control.
For a counterargument to the argument that quick adoption should be a priority because popularity will prevent governments from banning bitcoin, see

The $20k we're talking about here is a different thing, for Form 1099-K, not related to the request that the IRS made at Coinbase (though maybe the same dollar amount means they are somehow related).  
The 1099-K is supposed to be for businesses that accept payments from customers, and had over 200 transactions with a total of over $20k.  I've heard of it in the context of accepting credit card payments, not specific to bitcoin.  I think I heard a while ago of Coinbase sending a 1099-K to businesses who used them as a payment processor, but it's weird that exchanges are now sending a 1099-K just for someone selling his own bitcoin.
I'm not sure what the process is for people who aren't businesses and got a 1099-K; the basic idea might be that you just file your taxes how you normally would (paying capital gains tax when appopriate for selling bitcoin), and if the IRS sends you a letter asking why you didn't file a Schedule C for a business, you send them a response saying that you're not a business.

1099-B makes it optional for the cost basis to be reported.  For a while, stock brokerages didn't report cost basis at all, just the sale amount.  So, Coinbase wouldn't necessarily report wrong numbers; they could just leave the cost basis blank on the 1099-B (and then the user is responsible for providing the cost basis when filing their taxes).
Though, maybe the IRS wouldn't be satisfied with that, if they think many people are reporting fake cost basis.  For stocks, a few years ago the IRS started requiring brokerages to report cost basis.  I agree it'll be more complicated with bitcoin that's often held in users' own wallets.  One possibility is that Coinbase would just report the basis as $0 and then the user would need to indicate on Form 8949 that the 1099-B basis is incorrect (the IRS has specific instructions for this case; though, I wonder if this would increase the chance of being audited, since people could put fake info there).

It's probably because they're worried about fraud.  They likely get the money from your bank much quicker than that, but then they hold onto it before letting you buy bitcoin because there's a chance that the bank transfer will be reversed, e.g., if it turns out that your bank account was hacked.

That's not how I interpret it.  "at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-2015 period.”
I think that means $20k total in a year.  i.e., buying $10K and then another $10K (in the same year) would be included.  It says "one transaction type", not "one transaction".  (So, combine multiple buys, but don't combine buys + sells).  The "in any one year" part wouldn't make sense if they meant in one transaction.

Kraken had BCH trading very quickly (but not deposits/withdrawals until a week after the fork (though even 1 week is still much faster than some others like Coinbase)); so Kraken might allow trading of these future forks too.  Bittrex was similar (trading quickly, but deposits came later).  Shapeshift also had BCH trading.
Probably for most of them, if you want to trade immediately, you'd need to leave your BTC on the exchange during the fork; but then there's risk of your BTC getting stolen, etc on the exchange.  HitBTC had BCH deposits sooner than most exchanges (I might not want to leave my BTC there, but for just depositing an altcoin and dumping it, it might be fine).

Doesn't basing the decision on higher price have a similar problem?  What if miners (or a government, etc) buy a bunch of B2X to drive its price higher than Bitcoin temporarily?  After 48 hours, Coinbase would say "looks like B2X won, we're now calling it Bitcoin".  Then the miners stop wasting money, B2X price crashes, everyone's using original Bitcoin, except Coinbase who continues selling their users B2X and claiming it's Bitcoin.

The Bittrex Support website seems to use different accounts than the main Bittrex website.  So sign up for an account on the support site.
For Google Authenticator, when initially setting it up, did you write down a code, or take a screenshot of the QR code?  If so, you can use that to set up Authenticator on a new phone.  Otherwise you'll probably have to talk to the support people at each exchange.  GDAX has phone support now which might get you a faster response, though they have limited hours:

So far I'm not very impressed with them.  Their price for buying BTC is 2.4% higher than GDAX.  The referral bonus hasn't been credited to my account even though I followed their instructions to get it.  Their support people are useless.
But, they're maybe about the same as Coinbase, and maybe competition will make them both improve.  Or at least the load on Coinbase's servers &amp; support people will be reduced a little if people use Square instead.
Edit: The reason for the referral bonus not triggering for me was that I sent a payment to $red (red.org donation), which apparently is no longer an active account, so the payment didn't complete (even though the app said "Completed").

People can't even send Bitcoin Gold to exchanges yet.  People could be selling BTG if they had BTC on an exchange that gave them BTG immediately; but that has nothing to do with sending coins without replay protection.
But the dip in BTC could be caused by people selling BTC after the fork, e.g., if they just bought BTC recently so that they'd get free BTG, and now that they got the BTG they don't want to hold as much BTC.  It's interesting that the BTC price dropped by an amount similar to what BTG is trading at, kinda like a stock dividend.

I think his last sentence describes what he meant by other motives, i.e., maybe Coinbase is operating on fractional reserve and doesn't actually have as much BTC as their customers deposited; so they don't want everyone to withdraw BTC, because they don't have enough money to fulfill all the withdrawals.

For Robinhood, I'm pretty sure that the FAQ that you linked to on their website previously said something about withdrawals being allowed if you verify your identity.
But now they seem to have removed that info from the FAQ.  (The FAQ I looked at before was on their website, not in-app.  The URL was slightly different  but it shows the same text now as your URL.)
It's still unclear what the answer is.  If they decided to not allow withdrawals, I would think that the FAQ would specifically mention that.  Maybe they're tweaking the requirements for withdrawals.
Related to this, the Square Cash app lets you withdraw (after verifying your identity); some people have posted on reddit that it worked.

Those were his seed words.  But the next part, which he blurred, was his PIN.  He didn't really need the PIN at that point, since he could recover using the seed words, but he wanted to see the PIN anyway; and I think he didn't want to reveal the PIN to the public because he uses similar PINs for other services (the PIN mentioned in the article was also not his real PIN).

For  here's info about the security vulnerability: 
If someone had physical access to a Trezor and broke open the case and connected to some pins of the electronics, there was a chance that they could then use modified firmware to read the seed.  The problem has been fixed in newer versions of the firmware (which puts the seed in a place that will be erased before the modified firmware runs).
For  Both Trezor and Ledger Nano S have a way to enter the recovery seed securely, without a computer seeing the words (Trezor originally used a method where you type the words on a computer in a shuffled order, which would still be very very difficult for someone to figure out the right order, but not as secure as if they didn't see the words at all; now they have another option where you click with the mouse in positions corresponding to a randomized display of letters on the Trezor screen, so the computer doesn't see which letters you're selecting.  For Nano S, you use buttons on the device to select letters.)
Also, if someone gets your seed, I wouldn't say the "device will be worthless", since you can generate a new seed and move your coins there; but yes, if someone has your seed, they can steal your coins, if they do it before you move them.  But you can also add a passphrase, which is combined with the 24 seed words; without that passphrase, someone with your 24 seed words can't access your coins (actually they would see a different wallet, which you could put a small amount of coins in as a decoy).  The passphrase also gives protection against the physical vulnerability problem in

I think the problem is that Electrum (as of the latest released version 2.9.3) doesn't support segwit addresses yet.  Electrum 3.0 is adding segwit support but it hasn't been released yet.
Even though you can specify m/49'/0'/0' in the current Electrum, it doesn't yet know how to generate the P2WPKH-in-P2SH addresses (that start with 3) that segwit uses.
 on the BIP49 tab shows the same address as Ledger (or on the BIP32 tab, note that there's a "Use SegWit addresses (ie P2WPKH Nested In P2SH)" checkbox; it's more than just the m/49'... derivation path).

That thread also mentions some parts of the Bitcoin whitepaper that seem relevant:
For SPV, "the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification."
"We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them."
So, Coinbase is saying that they'll just blindly follow an attacker?  It kinda goes against one of the main points of Bitcoin.

The delay is an issue on Coinbase/GDAX's end, not related to the bitcoin network.  Coinbase often has delays at random times.  GDAX is usually pretty fast, though currently the top of their page says "Partially Degraded Service", and the withdrawal screen says "BTC trasactions are currently delayed. Your withdrawal may take longer than usual."; probably the issue is that a lot of people are withdrawing, so GDAX needs to manually retrieve more bitcoin from cold storage, which takes longer.  (Earlier today, even with that "delayed" message, withdrawals were actually still fast for me; but right now they're slow.)

This is normal behavior for Coinbase.  There may be delays while they transfer coins from cold storage, or they wait to batch transactions together, or maybe they manually review some transactions.  (It would be nice though if Coinbase made this more clear to their customers.)
If you wait a little longer the transaction will probably go through, but in general you shouldn't use Coinbase for time-sensitive transactions.  Instead, after buying bitcoin, transfer it to a wallet you control; later you can send from that wallet immediately.

It's possible that Trezor will provide a way to split the coins, even if segwit2x doesn't have explicit replay protection.  There are other ways of protecting against replay; whatever Coinbase is implementing, other wallets such as Trezor could also implement.  But we don't know yet if Trezor is going to do that.  If they don't, it might still be possible to use Trezor hardware with other wallet software that implements protection against replay; or, I think if someone sends you bitcoin that only exists on the normal bitcoin chain, and then you send your full wallet balance, including that new bitcoin, to yourself, that transaction will only be valid in one chain and you'll avoid replay.  There's also the option of entering your Trezor's seed words into other wallet software that provides a way to split your coins, but that exposes your keys to more risks.

A drawback of Gemini is if you only want to use ACH, not wire transfers, the limit is $500 per day.  (Though, Gemini does give you immediate access to the $500, without waiting multiple days for the ACH to post; but you can't withdraw the BTC you bought with that $500 until the ACH posts.)

I was kidding about the mattress, but my point was that it's not the dollar bills themselves that would pay interest, it's the bank.  Couldn't the same thing be done with gold coins?  You could deposit gold coins in a bank, the bank could loan the coins to other people and pay you interest.

I agree with his general opinion that Coinbase's policy is bad.  But block height or hashrate isn't the right thing to look at, since Coinbase said "accumulated difficulty"; I'd say this graph is more relevant:

He's talking about his prediction for the future.  That quote was jumbled up; his actual quote from the Economic Times interview, answering the question "Will blockchain disrupt the venture capital market?": "It rocks my business, it rocks the venture capital business. A huge portion of money raised by startups is going to be from ICOs. That means our market is growing smaller. We have to be more flexible and reinvent. VCs that do that will be very successful. This is a new technology and we have to get onboard. This technology is an opportunity to transform industry. The industries that are most easily transformed are those giving bad service at a high cost. Venture capital, banking, investment banking, healthcare, government are giving bad service at a high cost. They will now be all in competition with each other. Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual."

One concern with malware is for the initial step of transferring coins into the Trezor.  When you tell Coinbase the address to send to, what if malware replaces the text you paste with a different address?

One reason is probably that they're concerned about fraud.  If someone deposits money from a bank account, receives bitcoin, and then the bank deposit is reversed, Coinbase loses money (they can't reverse giving you the bitcoin if you've already transferred it out).  Putting a limit on the amount at least limits the amount of money Coinbase can lose.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:44:47
Also, GDAX doesn't have a limit for deposits via wire transfer (they do have a limit for ACH, which may vary per person; and for withdrawals via wire it looks like the limit is $10,000/day though you can submit a request to increase it).

The tax bracket you're in depends on total income, including capital gains, not just wage income.  So even if you make no money from a job, if your capital gains from coin trading are enough to put you in a higher tax bracket, your tax rate on capital gains won't be 0%.

I agree about the fork not being a realization event.  I'm treating it like a stock spinoff, where some of my original basis gets allocated to coin A, and the rest is allocated to coin B (and not reporting capital gain/loss until I sell).  I was going to allocate the basis proportionally based on the market values of each coin at the time of the fork, but there's complications with determining those market values.  And my recordkeeping is easier if I don't need to modify the basis of the BTC I'm still holding, and just use $0 as the basis for the fork that I sold.  In that article I linked, I don't agree with everything they said, but I was glad to see some support for treating the market value of the fork as $0 at the time of the fork.
Maybe the IRS will be ok with multiple interpretations, as long as you do something reasonable, and you're consistent; similar to how for stocks they let you choose FIFO or LIFO or other ways of determining basis.  They'll eventually get tax for everything you sell, just the timing is affected (and by using $0 as the basis for the fork I sold first, the IRS gets more tax money earlier, so maybe they'll be happy with that).
Another thought experiment: what if you sold BTC after the fork but you weren't even aware that a fork had happened; you reported it on your tax return with the basis being 100% of your original cost basis; a year later you find out that you have coins on a fork, and sell them; when you report that sale on your tax return, if you give it a cost basis of more than $0, then you'd need to amend your previous tax return to use a smaller basis for the BTC?  I think using a basis of $0 for the forked coin makes sense in that case.  Maybe in some cases there's ambiguity about which side of the fork keeps the original basis, but so far I think it's been clear that if you bought some BTC before the fork, and send it to an exchange after the fork using the same software as before the fork, you can sell it at the price that corresponds to BTC (maybe if a fork like SegWit2x happened, this would get more complicated).

If Coinbase's terms say no buying gift cards, that'd be funny, considering that Coinbase has a support page saying "Use bitcoin to purchase gift cards from services like eGifter, or Gyft":

A while ago they used micro-deposits.  But later they switched to the bank login method, and I think that's the only method they support now, except if you do a wire from a bank, they will then also allow ACH from that bank.

Dell might be a bad example; for high-value items that take some time to ship anyway, they'd probably wait for confirmations.  I see you addressed this in your [other article about double spending]( saying that merchants you'd expect to wait for confirmations don't since it doesn't fit into their legacy workflow.
But when I ordered from Dell several years ago, they first sent me an Order Acknowledgement, then 30 minutes later an Order Confirmation, and even that said "will go into production upon authorization of your method of payment".
But your point may still stand; coffee shops and other brick-and-mortar stores could abandon Bitcoin if they see too much fraud.  But could one outcome be that Bitcoin stops being used in those cases, but is still used for higher-value transactions where everyone waits for confirmations, or maybe as a backbone that other systems are built on?

Coinbase probably hasn't actually sent Transaction  on the bitcoin network yet.  Coinbase internally often has delays, e.g., they might need to manually transfer some coins from cold storage, or they want to review withdrawals that they think are "risky", or maybe they're just batching multiple withdrawals into one transaction.  The length of the delay can vary.  Probably if you wait another hour or so they'll finally submit it to the network.

From their help page: 
"When you purchase digital currencies with a credit card, you will be charged an additional 3% plus $0.30 on your order for credit card fees. When you use your bank account to pay, you will be charged a 0.5% bank fee. Your bank may charge you an additional “Cash Advance Fee” for using a credit card."
It's not clear what the charge is for debit cards.  Possibly they treat them the same as credit cards.
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:45:59
Thinking about this some more, since the fee reduces the amount of bitcoin you have, and you don't get any other currency in exchange for the fee, maybe it'd make more sense to leave your cost basis the same, and then sell the reduced amount of bitcoin.  e.g., if you bought 1 BTC for $1000, transferred it to a wallet for 0.002 fee, then sold 0.998 BTC for $1200: then treat your cost basis for that 0.998 BTC as $1000.
Or are you saying that in exchange for paying the fee, you received the service of transferring your bitcoin, and thus should pay tax on the gains on the fee amount?  (But then as you said, the gain on the fee would be tiny and basically round to $0.)
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:44:35
More specifically, it means buying the same dollar amount at regular intervals.  The "same dollar amount" part means that when the price is low, you buy more units of bitcoin than when the price is high, which can make your average cost lower in some cases.  (But there are other cases where it's not the best strategy; if the price keeps going up, it would've been better to buy the full amount all at once.)  This isn't specific to bitcoin; people do dollar cost averaging in the stock market; search the web for more info.  But you don't necessarily have to do the same amount each time; the general idea is just to keep buying regardless of the price.

Other reasons for not carrying a lot of dollar bills are that it's physically difficult to fit thousands of bills in your wallet, and less convenient to spend vs. swiping a credit card.  Bitcoin has advantages there.
But yeah, even if physical bills didn't have those problems, I'd still be hesitant to carry a large amount, for safety reasons.  Though, what if the bills required a password/fingerprint to be spent, so they're not useful if stolen?  Or what if after your wallet was stolen, you could go home and remotely transfer the bills that were in that wallet into another one before the thief can spend them?  A digital wallet on your phone, etc has some advantages there.

One theory about the purpose of BitcoinABC is that it encourages people to use SegWit2x, i.e., they're saying something like "if SegWit2x doesn't happen, you're gonna get something really bad, BitcoinABC, so you better signal for SegWit2x".  If BitcoinABC is seen as having no chance already, then that threat is less realistic, which could cause people to be less motivated to make SegWit2x happen.

What if someone is checking trillions of private keys, looking for one that corresponds to an address with money on it, and they get lucky and find yours?  If you had your money split between 10 addresses, you wouldn't lose everything.
(But I guess people would say that the probability of this happening is so low that it's not worth worrying about.  And in 40 years if the probability has increased due to more powerful computers or cracked cryptography, you could probably move your money into a more secure address before it's stolen (though there's a chance that we won't have enough warning).)

Are you sure it's for the new HD wallet?  The old style wallet also used 12 words.  Maybe try putting those 12 words into the first link I posted, just in case.
For the new HD wallet, the recovery link is  but it sounds like that's the one you already tried?  But yes, my understanding is that the 12 word seed for HD wallets should also work in other wallet software, like Electrum.
If none of that works, do you have a backup of your blockchain.info wallet?  They may have emailed you a wallet.aes.json file; there's ways you can recover using that.
Also, did you check your bitcoin address in a blockchain explorer to see if coins were sent from it?  I guess one possibility is that someone hacked into your blockchain.info account and sent the coins somewhere.

At Gemini, the $500 daily deposit limit is for ACH, but if you do a wire transfer there's no limit.  (But it sounds like you prefer ACH, and I agree.)  One nice thing about Gemini's ACH is that you can trade with the deposit immediately, just can't withdraw it until the ACH finishes in a few days.  The daily limit seems to reset at 5PM ET, on business days only.

Gemini has two methods for depositing money from your bank: wire transfer, and ACH.  ACH is easier &amp; free, but it takes a few days to post.

For a Roth IRA / Roth 401K, there's no tax when you withdraw.
For people who do short-term trading, worst case tax rate is higher than 20% (it could be as high as 39.6% federal, plus around 10% state (if you're in a state like California)).
If the premium dropped to 0% before, that may have been an overreaction in the other direction.
Some people pay full service brokerage fees instead of using an online discount broker; some people don't even know how to use email; those types of people will probably never buy bitcoin directly.
So, I think it makes sense for there to be some premium higher than 0% (but probably the current 70% or 80% premium is too high).  I agree that the premium on GBTC will drop if a competing ETF appears, but even that ETF could still have a non-zero premium.

Also, according to Coinbase support, they're working on an alternative way to do ID verification, for people where the questions-from-your-credit-report method you mentioned doesn't work.  I'm guessing that alternative method will involve uploading a picture of driver license, etc.

Is the recipient also using Coinbase?  I think Coinbase will do an off-chain transaction if the sender and receiver are both on Coinbase.  I don't know if Coinbase gives you any indication before doing the transaction of whether it will be on-chain or off-chain.  And if it is off-chain, I don't know if Coinbase shows your personal info to the recipient, but theoretically they could.  So sending to an address that you know isn't on Coinbase would be safer.

The last 2 are about a problem in one version of MultiBit HD (Beta 7), where they generated addresses in a non-BIP32-compliant way.

Other than that, it sounds like compatible wallets should be breadwallet, or Wallet32 for Android, or Hive; or generating the addresses yourself (like using that iancoleman link); it sounds like MulitBit HD uses BIP39 &amp; BIP32, without BIP44 (I think they have an option to restore a BIP44 wallet, but the wallets they generate don't use BIP44 (I think)).

No.  The passphrase is something you enter each time you plug the Trezor into your computer (unless you tell the wallet to remember the device when you disconnect).  The new Advanced Recovery method is just for entering the seed words for recovery, which is done much less often.  I think entering the passphrase via just the Trezor's two buttons would take a long time and get annoying.  Also note that the recovery seed words are from a list of known words, so the Trezor can narrow down which word you're entering after a few letters; vs. the passphrase which can contain arbitrary characters.

I ran into that problem with Electrum-LTC with an empty passphrase.  It seems to be a bug in old versions of Electrum, and it appears to be fixed in the new version 2.8.3.2 (which is currently in beta for Electrum-LTC).  And the old version worked if you entered a non-empty passphrase.
I think the benefits of hardware wallets vs. paper wallets come up when you want to spend from them.  With a paper wallet, are you going to scan it into an insecure phone/computer?  You could use an offline computer to sign the transaction and then send it on an online computer but that's kinda a pain.  And dealing with change addresses would be a pain with a paper wallet (you'd need to print a new paper wallet for the change address; or send the change to the original address, but that's less secure).

Adding on to my other answer... Coinbase's Multisig Vault might give both behaviors, depending on how you send a transaction.  If you use Coinbase's website to send coins, it could be submitted to whatever chain Coinbase decides (they may or may not give you a choice).  If you instead use your 2 keys to send coins without going through Coinbase, you should be able to pick the chain (and potentially spend the coins again on the other chain).

Your initial post wasn't clear, but it sounds like you're trying to buy a Trezor from Trezor's website.  That note about not paying from Coinbase is because sometimes when you send bitcoin from Coinbase, they delay a couple hours until actually sending the transaction.  It doesn't always have a big delay, so you could try it, but I guess Trezor's website is trying to avoid potential problems.  You could avoid the problem by first sending from Coinbase to another wallet (e.g., software on your computer or phone); wait until you receive the coins in your wallet, and then checkout on Trezor's website and send from your local wallet to Trezor.
You can also buy a Trezor from amazon.com (on trezor's website when viewing a product, click on "also available at amazon.com"), though the price seems to be higher there now than it used to be.  Some other sites might also have them; cryptohwwallet.com did but they're out until August 10th.

The 2 email addresses requirement makes some sense; they're trying to make it harder for hackers to steal your coins.  If someone hacks your email and hacks your Coinbase account, they won't be able to steal your bitcoin unless they also hack your second email.

Which exchange are you talking about?  At Coinbase, if you buy via ACH from your bank account, the price you pay is what it was when you initiated the buy (not the price after the ACH posts a week later).  But if it's an exchange where you need to wait for the deposit from your bank to post before you can trade, then you can't lock in the price now.  Gemini is kinda in between those; if you deposit via ACH (but only up to $500 per day), you can trade with that money instantly, but can't withdraw until the ACH posts.

Edit: also, if you find the address but you see that coins were sent out from it, that could mean that someone stole the coins already (or it was you moving them and you just forgot about it); but in that case, the balance could be split up into a bunch of addresses now, so it's harder than just looking for one address with 500 BTC.

The default in Authy is that backups are disabled.  But separate from that "backup" feature, they provide a way to get access to your Authy codes on another device just by receiving a text message.  That makes it basically as insecure as SMS 2FA.

Authy also had an optional backup method; if you enabled that in the app, possibly you could restore from backup as described at  (but they might've disabled that for Coinbase too).

Authy is an app for Android/iOS or for the Chrome browser.  If the app you use on your phone for 2FA is named Authy, you're using it.  If the app you're using is something else, like Google Authenticator, you're not using Authy.

I kind of agree with you if the attacker has your seed words.  But if they just have your hardware wallet without the seed words, I don't think it's that easy to brute force the passphrase.  Especially on the Ledger Nano S where the passphrase can only be entered on the device via physically pressing the buttons.  Maybe someone could rig up something to send fake button presses to the chip inside, but that's not something a common thief would do; and the key derivation happens on the device, so it'd be relatively slow.

For Coinbase specifically, I was hesitant to switch to GA from Authy due to Coinbase's reputation for poor customer support; if my phone dies and I'm locked out of Coinbase, it'd probably take weeks to get access again.
But you covered that in your point about having a backup.  Maybe keeping a paper copy of the GA QR code is the best choice (but then I need to hope that no one steals that paper copy).

They switched to HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet style in 2016; for that, multiple addresses are generated from the seed words.  Their old style wallet also had 12 words, but that was more like a password, and I don't know if the old address it gave you was related to those words.
So, now that you have the new HD wallet, they're suggesting that you transfer from your old address into one of the new addresses; that'd actually be a transaction on the blockchain (so you have to pay a miner fee).  After you do that, all of your addresses can be recovered with just the new seed words.  (I'm not sure if the new words they give you are different than the old 12 words; make sure you have the new words.)
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:22:19
The Trezor's recovery seed (24 words) follows the BIP39/BIP32/BIP44 standards for HD wallets, so you can enter that seed into other wallet software/hardware to recover your addresses.  e.g., Mycelium, Multibit HD, Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:59:35
I'm not an expert on this, but I think the main issue is that if your coins are on an exchange, depending on what the exchange decides, you might only get coins on one chain (which may or may not be the chain you want).  On the other hand, if you have the private key, you get coins on both chains.  (This is in the case that a fork happens.  It's also possible that a fork never happens, or a fork might happen but then disappear.)
But even if you have the private key, when you spend the coins, different things can happen depending on how you submit the transaction to the bitcoin network.  Your wallet software may send the transaction on a different chain than you want; this applies to hardware wallets too (the wallet holds the private key, but software is still used to submit transactions to the network).  But the nice thing about having the private key (or seed) is that you aren't locked into particular wallet software; you can pick a wallet that sends to the chain you want, and some of them will let the user pick a chain (e.g., Trezor's wallet software will let the user pick; but even if it didn't, there is other wallet software that can be used with a Trezor (or the seed from a Trezor)).

Maybe it's just asking you whether you want to create a second password.  Or maybe it always asks for a second password but accepts a blank one if you never created it.  Either way, try just leaving it blank and see if it lets you continue.  Or if it's forcing you to create a password, try entering an arbitrary word.

Ok... the bitcoin address for donations on the coinmarketcap website makes sense. I just thought it was weird that the picture attached to this reddit submission was that QR code... my first guess was that the address in the QR code belonged to the person who submitted the story to reddit (and their name doesn't seem to indicate that they run the coinmarketcap site).  Would anyone actually send bitcoin to a random address posted on reddit without any indication of who gets the money?

Coinbase is changing that...  recommends Google Authenticator above Authy.  And Coinbase is sending out emails suggesting that people switch from Authy to Google Authenticator.
The details of Authy are still unclear to me; does disabling multi-device support in Authy really completely avoid the SMS vulnerability?  And/or does setting a PIN, or enabling encrypted backups, protect against it?  If changing these settings makes Authy as secure as Google Authenticator, I wonder why places like Coinbase don't recommend changing those settings.  Maybe it's because Authy's documentation is so poor or the company is shady (it kinda seems like Authy intentionally tries to make people less secure), so it's better to just stop using them.
Maybe even with these configuration changes in Authy it's still less secure than GA, due to having a third party between the user and the site they're accessing; if Authy's servers get hacked, maybe someone can get your keys (or people inside Authy may have access to them).

Your coins on the exchange might end up being the same as if you had just left them there; but the difference (if your exchange doesn't support both forks and you transferred your coins off that exchange before the fork) is that your non-exchange wallet would also have coins from the other fork, which you could then potentially spend or sell on a different exchange that supports the other fork.

This is kinda common for Coinbase.  It might take an hour or two for them to submit the transaction to the network.  It could be due to their hot wallet being low and they need to manually transfer coins out of cold storage.  Or it could be that they have humans (or an algorithm) reviewing withdrawals and treating them differently depending on how risky they think it is, etc.

I haven't heard the "coin will be wiped" part before.  What exactly does it say?
Maybe this is a new security procedure at Coinbase.  Before, I think if someone else got your Authy keys onto their device, they could login to Coinbase and steal your coins.  Now maybe Coinbase automatically freezes your account when they see Authy used on a new device, forcing you to contact Coinbase customer support to regain access to your account.

I don't know if this is what he meant, but... Barry Silbert runs a fund that invests in ETC, and Barry Silbert is trying to change Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin is destroyed, the value of ETC may go up?
But a less cynical view is that Barry also runs a fund that invests in Bitcoin, so he'd want to help Bitcoin.  And his ETC investment could indicate that since he chose ETC instead of ETH, he values decentralization and immutability, and would want Bitcoin to also have those properties.
Or maybe he doesn't know which coin will win, so he invests in both.  And maybe he doesn't hold much coin himself, but rather will make money from the funds' fees.
My conclusion is that no matter what happens, Barry makes money.  So, how can I invest in Barry?  Maybe he can do an ICO and create Barry Tokens (or Silbertokens).

I can't find good documentation for it, but I've done it myself when my phone died; I got a new phone (same phone number) and was able to install Authy on it and access my old info after receiving a text message, even though I didn't have backups enabled in Authy.  (Coinbase did at least send me an email when I logged in, saying that my two factor settings changed; that's better than nothing, though doesn't help someone if their email account has also been hacked.)

That seems to just be a side note written by the author of that article, not Raoul Pal.  Raoul Pal seems to be more informed; his concern is "developers are talking about changing the Bitcoin code or how it works, what happens if – at some future point – they decide to allow the number of coins to expand".
Though, I think changing the number of coins would face much more opposition than the current scaling proposals.  But it is a risk.

What method do you recommend for reading the NFC tag?  If someone has Mycelium on an Android phone, with NFC enabled, should just holding the phone near the tag automatically open Mycelium and import the key?
Alternatively, without having Mycelium installed, would the phone still do something (e.g., display the text from the tag)?  Otherwise, I guess you could install an app such as NFC Tools to read it.
Also, does having Android Pay or Samsung Pay installed interfere with this?  In my phone's settings under "NFC and payment", Tap and pay, I wonder if "If open app supports Tap and pay" needs to be set to "Use open app instead of Samsung Pay".
(I didn't find this one... just giving suggestions to the guy who found it... It isn't clear to me yet whether Mycelium actually supports importing keys from NTC tags... maybe using an app like NFC Tools is the best way.)

I was thinking that you wouldn't need to add another bank on Gemini to send a wire transfer (since the wire transfer is initiated at the bank you're sending from).  But it looks like you're right; Gemini's website says "Wire deposits must originate from the selected bank account above. Gemini will refuse funds originating from an unapproved bank account."
I think Capital One should be able to do a wire transfer.  Some banks might not let you do it online though; you'd need to call them or go into a branch.  Capital One 360 can do it online:  but other Capital One accounts might make it harder.

For stocks, the brokerage fees/commissions would be added to your cost basis.  Here's an example: 
For bitcoin, the same should apply.  So if Coinbase charged you a $5 fee when you bought 1 btc at $2500, it's like you paid $2505 for it.  For a fee to transfer bitcoin from the exchange to another wallet, I think that'd be treated the same way.  For a fee to transfer from your wallet to an exchange, I'm not sure, but maybe you can treat it as reducing the price that you sell for.

To clarify my other answer: the new seed words will not recover the old imported address; they just recover the new addresses in the HD wallet.

There's actually 3 keys for Coinbase's Multisig Vault; Coinbase has 2 and the user has 2.  To sign a transaction, 2 out of 3 keys are needed, so the user can do that without Coinbase being involved (but as you said, doing that might not be simple).  In the context of this question about a fork, I think this means that the user would have coins on both chains.  Coinbase claims they don't have access to your password that encrypts the 2nd key that's stored by them, so they can't sign a transaction without you providing the password (but maybe there's some risk that they get your password next time you log in, and use that to send coins without your consent).

I thought it was going to say that banks will start denominating loans in bitcoin instead of fiat.
