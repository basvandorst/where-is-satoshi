Ordering the Pizza from Takeaway.com was the final straw on our efforts to adopt BTC properly, I said around 8 months ago to my partner that the day we can get one delivered to our door would be the day we offically take it as payment, well the day was the other day and here we are using Bitpay.
The order was an 18Inch, Texas BBQ Chickem with stuffed crust.. Quite nice actually, don't worry i didn't eat the lot to myself ;)
Soft Launch? No way we're  ONE year old in May  our website is just undergoing some extensive plastic surgery, maybe some botox as well :)
We have different nodes, the LET ones do not include a SLA, you can notice the price difference there also.
IRC is allowed providing no DDOS's etc happen,  Tun/TAP is enabled + many other modules such a IPsec etc.
We've got nodes located in Weehawken, NJ - Hampshire, UK, - Amsterdam, NL (No Stock currently)
Our Dedicated line up includes: TX, NJ, ATL, LA in the USA and for Europe: UK, NL.

Our website is currently having a makeover just abide by the laws of the ordered country and you will be fine :-)
No Spam, Mass emailing and hacking material &amp; copyright infringement is the biggest ones.
Please let me know if I can help any further.

If there is a continuous problem with DDOS attacks then we would suggest getting some filtering in place. We can provide 2 options 1) USA Filtering (10Gbps Limit) as well as options in the EU but the pricing here is higher.
If and when a client receives a DDOS attack we will investigate immediately if we're not able to mitigate it we will put a temporary Null on the IP until the problem is resolved.
It all boils down to how big the attacks are and what type of attack it is in all fairness.
