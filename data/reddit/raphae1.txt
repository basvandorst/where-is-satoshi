For me, Intersango is history as well. They canceled my account without any notice and kept my money. Who's next? bitstamp? therock?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:45:31
I still hope, I can buy some of their cheap bitcoins.

You do realize, that just about every website can do whatever the hell they want with their own comment section. This means that free speech does not exist on the Internet.

Wow, those trading fees certainly had a huge effect on Chinese markets. I guess, China will pioneer XBT darknet markets in 3, 2, ..

To me this looks like China essentially closed their biggest markets in January 2017.

no matter where the price goes. Either it is good for buyers or it's good for sellers.

Hint: Sell your coins, when the price is high, and buy some, when the price is low.

A lower hashing power doesn‘t really „allow“ a rogue agent to attack the chain. It only means that users should wait for more confirmations of a transaction. Even with 51% hashing power there is only a higher chance to win the next block, the chance to get 2 or more in a row are still very slim.

What are the reasons, and what's the point?
I mean, we had between 1M and 3M US$/day for the last two years. Do you think, that will just stop? For what reason?

It could just be a multi-sig wallet (like greenaddress), where you need the signature of the bank additionally in order to enforce things like transaction limits or allow the locking of a wallet, if the mobile got stolen.

It's true. In a dept economy nobody wants hard money. The more in dept you are, the more inflation you want. That's the reason we see inflation in the first place. Inflation is supposed to save the bankers asses. That strategy will result in hyper-inflation.

Actually the cost of the first state pension system is so high, that most people cannot afford a second private insurance.
And because of demographic changes those costs are rising fast.
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:13:24
The pension system in most European countries doesn't work by "saving" your money until you got old. Instead what you pay for your pension is immediately paid to someone old enough to receive it. It is called "generation contract", so you hope that when you get old, someone else will pay for you.

Well, you can read the source code of the /dev/random device. Besides, it would take a while to verify, that your dices are in fact fair dices. And yes, the random number generators used for /dev/random are in fact random tested.

Broken randomness once was an issue with old Android devices. It has been fixed. But of course there are broken wallets. Stick to the ones listed on bitcoin.org

It is too expensive to buy even 10 Minutes of the necessary equipment.

Mobile wallets have the advantage, that you can spend your bitcoin on the way, and since all smartphones have cameras, they can scan QR codes, which saves you from entering long bitcoin addresses.

I can buy bitcoins at the local tabaco store with cash, if I want.

There are people who offer PayPal payment on

But I'm not sure that really works, since PayPal generally boycotts bitcoin.

Checkout airgap.it
You can use your old smartphone, destroy the wifi/bt chip, and use it as an offline bitcoin or ethereum vault. Install airgap wallet on your online smartphone. To sign transactions you can use qr codes. 1st to send the transaction to the offline smartphone and 2nd another qr code to transfer the signature back to the online smartphone. It does not support segwit addresses though.

You can use electrum. It's not as secure as hardware wallets, but if you use a password to encrypt your key, it is reasonable secure for the amount of bitcoin you plan to store there.

The answer to your question 3: An exchange is what you ask for in question 2 &amp; 4.  
You can find exchanges on [
  
ad 1) No, online wallets are not secure. Yes, you can use platforms like [ but I would not recommend to use an online wallet. I'd rather download a wallet like electrum on [ which is more secure, because you own the keys to your wallet. Remember: Not your keys, not your bitcoins.

The government has been involved in drug crimes before, and probably is in Afghanistan as well. Do you believe some Taliban group is still making all the money from producing 90% of global heroin supply after 14 years of war?
