What's the point of money if you never use it?

Some of the time when people say "Bitcoin is a scam or garbage." The criticism isn't necessarily on the quality of the code but on underlying issues with Bitcoin. Such as depreciation from the fixed number of coins and it's volatility.
I'm not against Bitcoin, I just feel like there are valid criticisms that aren't misleading. And it seems like whenever anyone criticizes Bitcoin on this Sub, groupthink kicks in and immediately​ denounces the criticism regardless of it's validity and truth.

Perhaps, but you have to remember the market cap for Bitcoin is small (43 billion), for comparison Microsoft stock is more than 10x as large at 572 billion. As market cap goes up there is less of a chance of any individual or group to influence it significantly. Of course, Bitcoin being finite means that the price would have to go through the roof to increase market cap to similar currency sizes.

Thank for the well constructed comment. You seem very knowledgeable about this, and I will learn from what you said and do a bit of research of my own.

Perhaps you're right. I know everything I say may not be 100% right, but I accept that I have something to learn. I just want a thoughtful conversation and am not trying to be too offensive. I don't really care about being downvoted so no worries there!

And almost every other currency at that, but I suppose you could still make that argument.

I'm not trying to personally attack anyone. Anyways, I do have stuff to learn, although I would say my basic economics is decently sound. I understand your argument but a lot of the stuff you're citing for me being wrong is more what I consider conspiracy theories and I can't/don't really want to debate that. I apologize if my ignorance angered you and I should've been more specific, but I didn't want a wall of text no one would read anyways.

I understand Bitcoin has value, my point is that for the us dollar and its purpose in the economy, the fed is good. And that Bitcoin cannot completely replace the dollar, as they have different purposes. 
No one recommends just leaving usd in the bank and hope it beats inflation, you invest in things like bonds and stocks to make more than inflation. The us dollar is also a great medium of exchange because it's stable. These things cannot be said about Bitcoin, so of course its purpose is different. Right now it's mainly for speculation and if you want to spend your bitcoin, you can do that.

I swear people need to learn some more basic economics. If it wasn't for the fed we'd have skyrocketing inflation, the fed has done many good things for the us dollar, some stuff poorly but overall good. There's a reason the usd is the de facto currency. Bitcoin has its purposes too but it can't replace the us dollar, as Bitcoin can't control supply.

Perhaps you're right, and no matter what happens, it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.

But first mover advantage helps with the name recognition and more services being based off of Bitcoin. You don't hear of "store accepts monero payments" nearly as often as "store accepts Bitcoin," despite monero being more secure.

I didn't read the article, but I think the point is more a unit of storage, as in converting cash to Bitcoin. Much more secure from thefts than a safe full of cash.
