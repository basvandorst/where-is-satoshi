Sounds like you've never worked at a software company.  There are plenty of incompetent people working senior positions.  There's a big difference between someone just doing integration work, implementing algorithms, or being an architect.  FYI you can be competent and still not understand something / fuck up a project.
Not saying this guy is incompetent or whatever, just that a job title doesn't prove anything.
When is BTC going to fucking bottom out?

i was just going to let this go, but i don't know why you( downvoted me, so going to point something out to you (idunno, maybe it wasn't you)
Glancing at the commits, looks like he works on device drivers.  Development work on linux device drivers is, for the most part, pretty basic and tedious.
again, not saying he isn't smart or anything like that, just pointing out that it would be impressive if he was working on something interesting:
"Wow, that guy does some interesting work and solves hard problems!  Look at all those commits on the ~~CPU and IO scheduling subsystems~~!"  "oh, *device drivers*?  womp womp"
