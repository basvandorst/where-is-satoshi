Ah is it an American thing - I live in the UK and you can't really buy dogs from pet shops here. Dog breeding is also quite strictly regulated here, they have to be registered and sometimes get licences from the council. The woman who bred my dog had the mother as a working dog on the farm and all the puppies were well looking after and healthy. Don't see what's wrong with it in the uk to be honest from my experience.
Had a rescue Rottweiler before at 4 years old and she was a bit tempermental and no matter how much we tried we couldn't get her to socialise with other dogs which was a shame because we couldn't take her anywhere.

I've just sent a transaction 300+ sat/b and it's more than 30 minutes still unconfirmed. This is just fucking stupid and not viable for purpose.

You can contact exchanges and they will raise your limits but you have to be trading/handling a larger volume. I requested from Coinbase and they upped the limit.

Why would I trust a company that can't design a decent looking website to cryogenetically freeze me?

I bought my dog from a woman who breeds them - I'm not up to date on why reddit seems to hate breeders, what's the actual problem?

Absolutely good reasons to pick one, always nice to see people appreciating watches, no matter the brand. One of my favourite watches is actually the least expensive at about £50 - Bought it at Camden market in London from two young guys starting their own company and the watch is made from sustainable bamboo. It's very low quality compared to some others I've got but looks great and is super light, people are always interested in a wooden watch. Always reminds me of the super charismatic guys really excited about starting their company. A watch is what you make of it, enjoy the Rolex.

Feel free to tell me to fuck off but I'm partial to a watch or two and just wanted to let you know that a Rolex isn't a particularly amazing or fantastic watch and for nearly $8k dollars you could get a used Patek Phillipe - I know some might not want a used watch but as long as it's kept in mint condition these watches are incredible, patek phillipe is one of the oldest watch makers in the world and their new watches can fetch up to a quarter of a million euros. They had a 175 year anniversary watch a few years back which was selling for millions of euro, I went to see it in Munich and they had armed guards. Fantastic watches though and for anyone who knows anything about watches having a Patek Philipe is incredibly more status worthy than having a Rolex.

Register on Coinbase and you can use a debit card to buy up to £500 immediately. You can verify a bank to send more through a bank transfer but this takes longer, up to a few business days.
Coinbase is linked to GDAX so you will log into GDAX with your Coinbase account.

*A watch is a small timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities.*

Yeah but what's she going to do with it? Can't even open la gazzetta website with a computer so saying that crypto can transfer money to anyone on the planet is a bit optimistic.

Anything on when the fork to Segwit2x is expected?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:56:57
I dont understand what this means?
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:38:18
What does this mean, at that exact price all those bitcoins will be sold off?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:47:54
Agree, brilliant guide, what are the reasons for the 'forks' and when can the next be expected? Does it mean essentially if we have 0.1 BTC after the fork we will have 0.1BTC and 0.1 whatever the fork is called?

Lmao what the fuck? Do it at home then? Why would you even listen to that?
