Thanks again! After checking the 100~ addresses that were in the file, I didn't find any with a balance. Unfortunately it looks like I may have stopped mining before a single block was finished, or this isn't even the original wallet file and I installed Bitcoin Core in between then and now and forgot about it.

So, tried that, and I got a spinning icon for a second but nothing happened. I'm assuming that means it's empty, but I went back and learned how to use the pywallet option and got a big lists of addresses. Will they only show a value on blockchain if I used them before to send? I know I mined but never actually bought anything back in the day.

Hmm after further searching a different hard drive I found another wallet from 2012, which was probably actually my original wallet; it had a single address in it, which shows 0 balance, but it also has an extra line in the dump from pywallet that says 'fGenerateBitcoins": "True"' which the other wallet did not have in it. Doesn't seem to mean anything, unfortunately.

It seems like the second one requires me to have Bitcoin Core installed with the wallet already in it. If I only have the wallet.dat file because this was a storage hard drive and it's currently on my new computer, would I still be able to do anything?

Thank you! If I don't know my addresses from back then does the wallet.dat file actually do anything?
