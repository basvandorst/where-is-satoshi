no they are actual blocks. you can see the data on btc.com, but they aren't giving any payout information. I don't see anyone else talking about it though which is weird. I am new at mining so I am not sure if thats normal or not, and they have increased their hash rate so it doesn't seem to be concerning people 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:34:49
idk kinda pissed. if i want those bitcoins I will have to go back on antpool until i hit the payout threshold.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:47:31
Ya lots of reasons. Do your own research and figure it out. They can say whatever they want, this is an unregulated space. They won't do an audit and anytime they say they will they come up with an excuse not to do a full verifiable audit.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:09:24
lol. anyway you care to give a real retort? do you find it impossible that someone would manipulate markets to make money? i find the information credible enough to pull my money off the table and tether has all the elements of a ponzie scheme
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:20:25
do you see the block any payout info?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:41:35
ya i read the article, is all you can do is continue to re post other peoples information and not come up with anything on your own? the only thing you have came up with is a continuation of insults that does nothing to further your point. 
Why will they not do an audit when they have stated they would? There is no verifiable proof tether is backed by the correct amount of USD, and anytime they say they will do an audit they kick the can down the road or some up with the latest "memo", you cannot deny that is shady. 
My speculation that if the above is true it will, without a doubt, cause instability in the crypto markets. Most people barely understand btc, all they know is that is going up, and anything that interferes with that or causes doubt to an unregulated asset class with cause the herd to rush for the door. This is called human behavior, something you clearly haven't studies or understand. Is this speculation? sure, but it doesn't take much for markets to get spooked and denying that is burying your head in the sand
I have never stated this will end bitcoin. I believe it will cause a sever drop in price in the short term. If people have made good money it could be a good time to pull some out, but that's just me. but please see if you can make an intelligent argument on your own without doing an insult, or copying and pasting articles that are no more or less reliable then mine

so you continue to throw insults? doesn't make your position any stronger. We can go back and forth throwing counter arguments that attempt to negate each others positions all day. At the end of the day there is nothing stopping tether to print as much as they want. Why will they not do a fully verifiable audit? they keep kicking the can down the road and refuse to do any audits. This article was created before the sept 15th "audit" was done, which wasn't an audit. Had they done the actual audit they said they would do there would be zero issues.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:36:23
I agree after reading what I have. They have seemingly created tokens with no verifiable backing in order to skirt regulatory requirements. and have possibly manipulated the price of bitcoin to keep their scheme going. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:02:03
Wow. So i changed my mining pool to slush pool and as soon as the worker stopped on antpool they inputted all the information into the blanks and only gave me credit for the 494610 block. basically they used all of my hashing for a day without giving me any credit. SCAM

or until quantum computers come out and they can derive your private key from your public key in a matter of seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:09:49
there isn't an audit underway, they never did one and most likely wont. There is zero verifiable proof the money is in the bank
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:44:59
I thought that was called off a week or so ago
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:24:59
Same, the site is jacked up right now. Just concerned they will not pay out on the blocks that have been mined today since the stats for them are not listed. but I see no one else on the internet talking about it which is weird
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:05:51
Ya calling me out with zero info to support anything you have stated while there is piles of info to support my theory if you cared to read it. But please keep ignoring it. Why not buy some tether while you are at it? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:28:11
just 13.5 t/has. 1 S9. its not alot, m0re of the principal of it
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:48:15
You shut the fud up 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:06:44
again an entire post without any facts in it, only insults. are you scared your bitcoins might be as risk? you seemed like someone who is worried about the position they are in so they lash out with insults. or maybe you are a paid bitfinex/tether employee? If tether fails it will, without a doubt, cause issue with bitcoins price. I understand you cannot understand this and cannot understand how people will react, and cannot understand what happens when crowded trades finally falls. but please keep your head buried in the sand and keep telling yourself that he price of bitcoin will forever go up.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:14:19
No i bought it through a seller on amazon at a markup, but it wasn't as bad as on ebay. I am looking into buying the Jan batch on bitmain.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:12:01
The website is down but they still appear to be mining. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:13:41
i think the are trying to screw people over. ant pools seems shady after doing reserch
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:06:56
one of the article main points was the upcoming audit will clear everything up, and did it? no. If you cannot see that tether will cause instability in the cyrpto space and cause people to loose faith in crypo idk what to tell you. Its very clear you are happy to bury your head in the sand and resort to name calling because you cannot come up with any of your own intelligent responses.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:03:26
You haven't given one fact in any post. Anyone who is the self described decider of what is logic and then fails to give any logic, facts or details in any post needs to reassess their stance. Please continue with the school child level insults they are quite entertaining 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:51:35
You mean the article from someone else that you posted that give about as much facts that you have given (zero). Such a sad little shill you are, and clearly upset and thinking your bitcoin position is at risk so you have to lash out. Very troubled individual 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:17:59
I would rather have tether backed up by the USD rather then nothing, which is the issue. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:12:55
I am on my first day so far. im at about $20 so far, not subtracting electricity fees.
