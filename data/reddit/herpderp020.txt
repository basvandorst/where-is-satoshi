U2F uses a keypair to generate all other subkeys for each individual website. So the subkeys need not be backed up. However, in the case of other U2F devices such as a Yubikey the master keypair would never change, so it does not need to be backed up.

You can't as you're using Coinbase as the middle man. Localbitcions.com is your best bet where you can meet up face to face with someone.

I don't have an android phone, but hear Mycelium is well recommended.

3 does not mean multi sig. It's a P2SH transaction.

There are two ways to recover the public key.
1. If you take a message and sign it with the private key you can recover the public key. There are actually 4 possible public keys and there is a byte in the header to identify which curve was used to sign with. If you are curious with how this works you can look at recoverFromSignature() [here](
2. Once you spend money from an address the public key gets provided as part of the input script for the transaction in order to move the coins from one address to another. You can see how the public key is extracted in checkSig() [here](

Then just buy Bitcoin rather than buying mining equipment.

Actually the best way to ensure coins are burned is to send them to any address with the scriptPubKey of OP_FALSE or OP_RETURN 0, hence nobody would be able to redeem them.

Bitcoin can be divided to as many decimal places necessary.

How is this different than SSL client authentication?
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:12:10
Yes, the input script contains both the signature and the public key from whatever address the money is coming from. The output script contains something called the pubKeyHash which as you now know is also called a Bitcoin address (technically the address also has the version number along with a checksum). There is a list of unspent transactions in the bitcoin network. Your client sees if any of those point to an address you have.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:14:47
It's basically the opposite of SSL server auth. You know when you go to google and it shows the certificate of google and now you trust it because it was signed by a CA? Same thing here except in reverse, I try to login to a website and it asks for my certificate, I present it to the server and it knows what account to log me in under.
It's standard X.509 and supported by most webservers such as apache, nginx, etc. It's just a shame no one uses it because people don't want to manage certificates to login.
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:03:17
Why not just sign the new key with the old one before it expires. Or just change the expiration date?
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:02:38
Nope. An address is not a public key. The public key goes through several hashes with a checksum added to it in order to create an address. If you have the public key you can get the address for it. If you have a bitcoin address you cannot get the public key.
The order is as follows:
Private key is used in order to create the public key. The public key then is used to create the address.
Here is the transformation from public key to address.

The SSL cert is not just used for encryption but for authenticity. I can be sure that blockchainbdgpzk.onion is actually blockchain.info because DigiCert told me they are, and I implicitly trust DigiCert.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:43:10
That's not true. The server can make the certificate optional and then redirect to an error page if not authed properly. Only if the server requires a client cert then the SSL connection will be terminated because the party wasn't able to identify themselves, at which point it's up to the browser to let the user know what happened.
I'm not bashing down this idea but it does nothing that PGP or the PKI couldn't do. And the cool thing about X.509 certificates is that they have my name, email, etc on them so when you register for an account somewhere you don't have to fill out those forms. Don't want to give your identity away? Auth with a PGP key that has bogus info, which is the same level of anonymity that authing with a bitcoin address would have. I'm just playing devil's advocate here to see what this new thing could offer.
Edit: just wanted to also say that authing with PGP/Bitcoin address is what is used on

Yes, we agree that the bank is the one who will approve and deny transactions. I just corrected you when you mentioned that it's Apple's fault, because it isn't as they have no control over the process.
In fact when giving your card at a restaurant waiter they can easily skim the card to make a duplicate or write down the details to add to their iPhone for Apple pay later. When you look at these two methods its clear that it's much easier to just take a picture of the card and hope that the bank will allow you to add the card to your phone and then it's free game which will lead to these statistics showing higher fraud. But it's nothing wrong with Apple pay, in fact it is a great implementation, and if the banks went through great lengths to allow only the legitimate user to add a card to their iPhone then it's actually pretty hard to abuse because, like Bitcoin you wouldn't be handing your private key to pay.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:34:24
Apple is not a payment processor. They do not authorize transactions, nor do they see them when you use Apple pay.
The only time Apple is involved with Apple pay is when you type or take a picture of your credit card information for the first time. They will ping your issuer (read: bank) to get an approval if the card is valid. Your bank at this point can accept/deny/or challenge the request where they can request more information from you either by having to call in to have the card added for Apple pay, or to download their app and sign in with your online banking credentials in order to approve the card for Apple pay.
Once your bank has given the approval to Apple, they will send over your device account number (16 digit virtual credit card number) and the key generator used to generate the valid one time use codes.
From this point on everything is between you and your bank. Apple does not facilitate any transactions from this point onward. In fact, you can use Apple pay without an internet connection. The Apple watch will be able to do this without having your phone next to you.
The problem here is due to the fact that banks do not have good security practices when approving the card to be added for Apple pay. When the thief has already added your card to their phone their fingerprint of course can be used and your bank just sees a regular Apple pay transaction and will probably approve it because why the fuck not.

They have a simple API to send push notifications to Android/iOS.

Yes, but not a *central* authority. One person cannot change it for everyone else. Everybody must agree.

Scroll down to where it says news and promos and they mention it there.

Doesn't blockchain.info do this already when you add a watch only address?
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:25:29
Hard to say. Can you try following these steps to create the raw transaction? 
That should work, and would let you know if brainwallet has a bug with the raw transaction thing. But decoding it clearly showed that you are spending a transaction that I assume you can't sign for.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:13:56
Unless the person doing the double spend has a miner which doesn't broadcast the double transaction and is able to forge a longer blockchain and then broadcasts it, invaliding the first transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:26:07
Any updates? :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:47:24
With Electrum you can send to multiple address at once. CSV transaction I believe it's called.

I'm not sure, but decoding it shows that you are using 
as Vin. That was the block reward from the 4th block. Are you sure you can sign that? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:21:45
You can't. Your iPhone can. If you can put it on a jail broken device then there are programs that can repackage the IPA without encryption. If you right click on the app in iTunes and view it's details it will let you know if it has FairPlay or not.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:54:36
Yeah but they print out the BIP38 encrypted key so they can't unlock it because you have the password for it. Hence it's still safe.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:59:18
Th authority is spread out over all it's users. I can't change any of the parameters without everyone agreeing to it for it to be used.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:49:23
That program and also Xcode. The IPA you linked has fairplay encryption on it so you need the apple ID &amp; password of who purchased it originally. If the fairplay was removed then it would be no issue for me to sign it and run it on the phone. Oh well, should have downloaded it when it was in the app store.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:18:03
I will be coming as well!
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:48:17
I tried downloading the ipa and even resigning it with my developer account and it wouldn't launch on the device.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:37:53
Yes it's called the locktime parameter.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:16:37
There's no central authority. The fact that everyone decides to run the same bitcoin software defined by the same rules is what allows the rate to be defined. If a big pool wanted to increase the amount of bitcoins created by mining it would simply be a fork of bitcoin, like dogecoin and it wouldn't called be bitcoin anymore
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:31:59
Yeah, so clearly OP didn't finish filling in all the fields.
