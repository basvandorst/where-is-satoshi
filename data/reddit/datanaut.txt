Does the article linked cause you to lose respect for Gavin? Can you explain why?

So you agree that satoshis code isn't "good"?

Knowledge about the founders of a venture is relevant to predicting whether the venture will succeed. If Mark Karpeles had a great idea for a bitcoin startup, and devs who thought Karpeles was a genius joined him to work on it, and then Karpeles left the project, you are trying to tell me that the fact Karpeles started it has no bearing on it's chance of success?

I never thought it was likely that darkwallet would work out simply because the guy behind it is that guy who 3D prints guns for media attention.

You only need monotonicity.

You want more traffic to your site that's fine. It is a standard thing for sites to want more traffic and to expend effort to get it. Traditionally websites pay advertisers per click through. The amount most websites pay for a user to visit their site is on the order of tens of cents. You are expecting instead that you can direct traffic to your site by paying a few hundredths of a cent per visit, and furthermore that people will not just visit but give you their email address. I am not saying you are malicious, I am saying that you want traffic to your site like everyone else in the world, but what you are willing to pay for it is orders of magnitude lower than what is standard. So no, I don't think the rate you are implicitly willing to offer per user directed to your site is anywhere near "understandable" as you said to @_date: 2016-02-28 05:12:38
I'd say it would be far more reasonable to have  a BTC as the prize. 
Given the volatility say that BTC will be valued in a $200 range. That would mean 20000 possible values down to the cent. So you would be paying roughly $400 total to have 20,000 people sign up for your site. If fewer people participate the probability of anyone winning decreases, so the expected cost per participant doesn't change.(assuming uniform distribution for simplicity)
You are saying that it is reasonable for people to spend a few minutes visiting your site and participating in your contest for something like a 1/20000 chance of winning a Litecoin which is generously worth about $4. So you want people to spend like 3 minutes of their life and give you their email address for an expected value of 0.02 *cents*. If you were giving away a BTC, it would be more like 2 cents expected value, which would be far closer to reasonable.
You are expecting to get people to sign up for your site for 0.02 cents a pop. That is a little bit ridiculous. That would mean you could expect to get 1,000,000 people to sign up for your site for a measly $200.

 &gt;I have a few K to get me through till I get out and plus I still got 2 pretty nice cars I could probably sell if need be. 
I would think about selling at least one of the cars before you go to prison. Cars tends to depreciate quickly, and three years of not using nice cars is just a huge waste I think. Unless these are classic cars of some sort that hold their value, you should really sell them over letting them sit for 3 years. Think of it this way: you could probably sell the cars now, and then in 3 years have the money to buy more valuable cars than what the value of the cars would been if you let them sit 3 years.

Offering the chance at a prize to people who visit your site is not exactly creative. It's like having an ad banner that says "click here for a chance to win!" and when you click you find out that you have a 1/20000 chance to win $4.

I don't think you will get 20k submissions, but I do think any given submission will have about a 1/20k chance of winning.

I don't think the numbers are quite right, but in any case I think it is worth pointing out that empires tend to live longer than humans, so it would make sense for their debt/income ratios to be different.

I guess it's in the directors cut then?

Nah the rally never stalled this hard last time.

Yeah from T2, I'm pretty sure it's from the movie and not an outtake.
@_date: 2015-11-06 15:38:32
Yeah I still remain hopeful, if you ignore the recent spike to 500 you can see what looks like a steady exponential rise. I'm a little worried that the rise in google trends is still pretty weak.
