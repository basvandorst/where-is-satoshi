Let’s look at bitcoin before it was bitcoin.
How was anyone, even the founder, supposed to know how huge this thing would ever become? 
Whoever created it opened up pandora box and has become the worlds most notorious figures.

You dumb shit. They’re not “ignoring” you, they’re insanely swamped handling tickets from other idiots.
I had 15 bitcoin stuck on poloniex for 5 months and their support eventually got back to me. FIVE MONTHS MOTHER FUCKER!

There was a reddit ama with him a few years ago. He’s very intelligent and I’m in the same belief as you.

How does hoarding money give it value?
Money has value because of use case. 
If you want to go out and buy anything right now...some form of fiat is accepted as you payment.
This is money.
If every person hoarded bitcoin and didn’t spend it,  bitcoin would be a failed experiment.
Although bitcoin is a much more superior form of money, it’s far from universally being accepted as money.
 
Not sure what you’re linking but in summary, fiat has value due to the network effect. More people use and believe that it has value, therefore it has value.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:04:04
Hoarding it? No.
Using and spending it, yes.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:32:48
No, I’m actually right.
Name me one currency that gains its value from a small group of people hoarding it?
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:40:03
Hypothetically, if everyone hoarded money and no one spent it, the money is completely useless.
Point of money is a medium of financial exchange.
Fiat is actually pretty good at being money. 
The big problem with it is inflation. It’s being inflated because its flow is centrally planned.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:06:02
In today’s global economy, bitcoin excedes every capability that gold had.
Also, gold is insanely inefficient as a store of value because you can’t convert it to fiat without using a series of custodians and brokers.
If you own a lot of gold, you can’t just sell it. You need to hire a broker to find you a market and these brokers take huge cuts.
Safe guarding gold? Bitcoin has gold beat by a mile.
Gold has a controlled level of inflation from gold mines. It’s not as scarce as you think and there are rarer metals out there than gold.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:48:25
Price would rise high enough versus what? Fiat?
That’s relative.
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:48:15
I definitely agree that there are a lot of useless posts but this is reddit and this expresses ideas of the general population, which is ok.
Enjoy these days because once bitcoins use case develops further, this space will disappear and be overrun with institutions and white collar finance guys.
These are the people who talk to the 99%

If you google CEO of Litecoin, you’ll find me
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:22:17
It is relevant because in order for bitcoin to gain purchasing power, it has to be widely used and accepted as a currency.
If everyone held bitcoin and not a single person spent it, bitcoin would die.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:03:31
But gold isn’t a currency.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:56:10
Bitcoin/fiat pricing is relative.
The fluctuation in price is showing us the real time purchasing power bitcoin has.
End game for bitcoin is that we are hoping to become the currency of choice over fiat.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:39:16
Contrary to popular belief, hodling does not help the price...wide spread use will help the purchasing power, then hodling.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:42:21
Yes. Whichever crypto comes out on top will have a form of central power baked in from “early adopters”.
Ps - we are still early enough to be considered early adopters
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:36:43
There are a few things that need to happen for bitcoin to become adopted.
The ETF approval doesn’t mean squat for the price (hint, price will go up) but the significance of an approval is that it’s a government agency telling the common folks out there that bitcoin is viable.
This will remove/contradict the narrative of bitcoin being a scam.
Once the greater population accepts bitcoin, the use case will follow along right behind.

I dumped my life savings in when it was $850 and was fortunate.
With my income, I can buy about .05 - .1 every month.
Pretty nuts to think it’s gone up that much and it hasn’t even start yet...
Just wait till we hit 50k-100k+
The fomo will be real then

The single biggest piece of advice to give noobs is to never ever EVER spend from a paper wallet. ALWAYS do a full sweep of the wallets entire balance.
The keys and passphrase storage is a no brainer. Don’t fucking lose them

2019 should be 2018, since he looks like he just kicked ass.
2018 should be 2019, because he is consoling a battered bitcoin

This is the biggest crock of horse shit I’ve ever read.
Sure, if the company issues dividends but how many actually do?
Majority of stocks do not.
The network is what gives bitcoin its value.

Yes! Tip me up!!!!

Your subject should be about BitPay, not bitcoin.
To someone reading who doesn’t know anything about crypto, this will discourage them. To someone reading who knows a lot about crypto, you sound like an idiot

Read the fucking post I was replying to you fucking twat
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:08:27
It’s tough to explain in a single reddit post but first, you should read up on fiat currency and how it works.
What you’re seeing with the price valuation of bitcoin in fiat is a perspective, relative to fiat.
Bitcoin is still bitcoin and functioning as is. This is the most powerful means of value communication the developed world has ever seen. (This is the part that the mainstream naysayers do not understand).
The jump in fiat prices tells a story of both speculation and price discovery. This is both ok and irrelevant because this is an asset class that is in its VERY early stages of development.
@_date: 2018-12-23 13:44:53
Do some research on people giving crypto as a gift.
Oh, the horror stories.
Even to well intended people, the concept was over their heads. 
How many more must we lose? How many!
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:31:27
You can. You have to deposit funds into the account, this takes time. It’s not “instant” like coinbase

Guys, this is bloomberg.
Who cares.
When was the last time they wrote a well informed article on bitcoin?

Bought in slow 2 weeks ago and was hoping for the price to drop further.
Am really hoping this is a bull trap and we have another leg down so I can blow my load and empty my bank account.

You’re too fucking stupid to be right.
Read his fucking post then read mine. I can’t help you beyond that. You’re either a troll or a fucking retard.
My money is on the latter
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:25:50
This is true.
But we have had a completely bullshit QE policy in place GLOBALLY since 2008.
Money supply in all of the worlds industrialized countries have been diluted and the hike in interest rates is going to cause a cascade

There’s a guy named spoetnik who is hilarious with trashing noobs. I actually still visit just to see him go off the deep end
