someone i work with calls it bipcoin, even when i clearly say bit whenever we talk about it. one day a while ago he said he read an article about it reaching an all time high of 8.7k and i had to correct him saying it went passed 9k overnight. he still calls it bipcoin even after reading about it. i could say bitcoin 5 times in a sentence and he'll still call it bipcoin. so annoying.

i wanted to sell what little i have at 19k or higher, it just about tripled what i put into it but couldn't because of gdax crashed lol maybe i'll get lucky before tomorrow.

 this worked for people in the past on this subreddit. maybe it'll work for you.

tfw i'm waiting for my 600 to clear on coinbase to transfer to gdax to avoid fees after it dropped back down to the 5.6-5.7k range only for me to wake up today and it be 7k. i would've been better off paying fees.

i can't imagine how you feel.
i was hesitant to buy when coins were in the 400 range when i easily could have afforded 7 of them at the time. i sold the little i did have for a total of 70 dollars which would have been worth, at time of this post, $1406 today. just added up what i had and it was .2 btc. that's almost half my debt, or 5 weeks pay right there. crappy job ftw.
at least you didn't spend 10k btc on pizza

i hope you get this straightened out. i'll try to help you out with exposure, i wouldn't want this to happen to me.
