Probably not. Litecoin never got over $300 when Bitcoin was at 20k. And why would anyone? What would make it worth 3k?

Take it easy man, let's try to figure out LN first now and then we'll know more what to do

Great write up, thanks so much. I think I get it now. It's not exactly what I thought it was, but I can definitely see the benefit, and with schnorr sigs you would be able to compress the signatures to just one on the chain too so that's great. Still, the benefit is higher as more people are involved, but that also makes it more likely that someone is offline at the time of updating which I guess is a caveat, right? But many people and for sure businesses are always online nowadays.
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:18:59
Yeah the same happens to me. I think fixing that is really trivial. Just thought it was a cool concept that I hope will become more of a reality in the future.

As we are pushing more and more to stop referencing prices in USD rather than in BTC, we should stop referencing time in years, and rather do so in blocks! Looking forward to the 600,000th, that will truly be a milestone! /s

You might be right on that with 0 fee, I'm just speculating. Also I know custodial wallets are unsafe, but just to keep 40 satoshis in it I think is ok, and many people don't seem to mind keeping whole bitcoins on exchanges so I'm just thinking in terms of having a ease of use trade off while better solutions are being researched for just messing around with LN and possibly trying [satoshis.place]( or something.

so basically forget about regular people running full nodes then I guess. Good thing there's enough non regular people that run it at least for now, I'm sure itll be fine
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:20:46
Well it's from greenaddress who have their bitcoin wallet listed on [bitcoin.org]( so there is reason to believe it's not a virus. But good for you to be cautious!
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:38:36
That's what I was thinking too. I was just wondering if there were some magic that could be done but I at least cannot imagine any way. However, if enough compression happens on the block chain and there is space left, bitcoin theoretically allow for transactions with a 0 fee, so maybe there is some way that could be utilized to make free channels if and when more compression is implemented, AND more traffic is taken off chain. I might be wrong on this but I think the satoshi whitepaper actually talks of zero fee transaction as a part of the intended use.
On a side note, as much as it pains me to say it I'm wondering if there exist custodial wallets that have good user interfaces in the form of a browser plugin or phone app, so if anyone knows of one please tell me. AFAIK without having tried it LNTipBot works like this being a custodial wallet you can fully use to pay and receive invoices, but the UI isn't exactly snappy.
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:45:43
That sounds interesting. I found this [ which gives a good run down of the app, but alas it doesn't support receiving yet but it's definitely a promising project that seemingly suddenly appeared. Hope for more stuff like this

Hey that's great. Thanks for the report. I thought you could only send with BlueWallet but I guess they updated it! Just wondering, would it be possible to just withdraw funds through a LN invoice without putting in an on chain transaction, and since as you say they handle channels etc in custodial ways then you won't have to worry about balances in different directions etc ?

I see. This made me think of the possibilities of sharding bitcoin and I wrote a separate post, but it got removed due to mentioning another cryptograhpic blockchain project so I thought I would just post it here instead if anyone would see it.
**Sharding the Bitcoin blockchain across IoT devices in your house**
I recently experimented with running Bitcoin Core on Android, and I have always been interested in hosting bitcoin on low end hardware as I believe having that possibility is one of the things that makes bitcoin truly resilient.
Running it on Android with ABCore works fine in theory, although there are some issues with the app wrapper, but the storage aspect is a problem that I think most would face if they wanted to run their own node on their phone. Pruning allows you to do this, but still I wouldn't sleep as safe at night knowing that I couldn't bootstrap on my own.
From that I started to imagine a way of keeping the whole blockchain, but scattered across small devices that are around in my house. I know ethereum devs are working on sharding, and although I haven't gotten that deep into it I was thinking that if you had IoT devices in your house, a media server maybe, a fridge with a bit of space on it, your phone, etc, you could scatter parts of the blockchain across them, keep a hash or something as a reference, and then be able to fully validate from scratch without having to trust anyone, without having to have the space taken up on just one device.
Anyone ever heard of any project like that?
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:47:30
Oh yeah, there's a pull request with a user dialog prompt etc in there with a comment 4 days ago so I guess they're on it!
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:02:19
Nothing, you only really need to change a few lines of code and start from a new genesis block. But you have to consider the network as a part of its technical properties and that's more difficult to establish.
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:06:42
I see. But forgive me for asking but you still manage your own channels with BlueWallet, even if the nodes are centralized?
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:38:13
You're funny, but also kind of a downer. Maybe some people have the deluxe fridge with 32gb bro 
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:22:37
Excuse me for asking, but with a pruned node do you actually still keep the whole UTXO set of bitcoin transactions, so you can revalidate from scratch using only that node? How big is the data set of that these days?

Just make a Facebook event and get a venue, and ask for 1 dollar donations to cover the costs
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:40:43
Yeah, thanks. I was just hoping to find something where I can just deposit with lightning straight up without the on chain tx
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:30:58
No I mean do you have to open a channel yourself (and pay the on chain fee) before you can deposit through LN?
