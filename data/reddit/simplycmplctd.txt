What a fucking rip off. Why not name it what it is? R/bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:17:26
What do you mean it'll fail? In case of a fire? Or on its own hardware flaw (which I'm not aware of). 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:12:31
Well fucking said. I have a cousin who is financially struggling and constantly spews libertarian bs.

No, he can't advocate/advise the world on it while he's holding millions in it. Now that he doesn't have a stake in it, he can act without people pointing to his millions stashed as LTC. Does that make sense?
That's essentially what Roger Ver is doing. Making huge promises while holding a massive amounts of BCH, of course he's going to whisper what you want to hear in your ear because his wealth is directly associated with *your* trust. How trustworthy is he when he has millions and millions on the line?

Doesn't it take a really long time for them to fail? Like a lifetime? I don't plan on holding it till I die, and willing to relocate my seed every X years. 
I have a ton of de moisturizing packs inside the safe as well to keep moisture out.

Ah okay. It's not some black magic fuckery as I suspected. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:47:40
Whoa shit didn't know that... Happened to have a link for it?
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:49:06
Fuckin Joe man... He's been coming up a lot with his show and every time I've given it a shot joe just sits there and his commentary is shit. Like he doesn't offer good insight, he just sits there and listens to their guest blabber on and just agrees with them making it a small echo conversation.
But maybe I've only seen the bad ones?
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:13:15
When are you going to cash out? Is it based on time, bitcoin's worth, or hearing some news on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:25:06
How much bitcoin did you cash out?
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:06:46
Spend it or sold it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:42:59
Good idea actually thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:17:13
Get a coinbase account, set up payment option, buy. I'm going to wait a little after the fork to buy more, but who knows what's the right thing to do as far as when. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:37:03
What is it at now?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:18:00
Toss them in a fire proof safe for extra measure 
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:23:07
Ahh trying to buy high sell low... I'd be afraid of getting off the train only for it to never come back!
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:03:31
Now that I think about it, the dark market is probably a lifeline for bitcoin. It'll keep a steady amount of transactions, and people buying up bitcoin to spend. 
Now why would you spend it on the regular market? You can spend dollars (which would inflate over time), or spend bitcoin that's quickly rising? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:05:06
Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:04:34
It's incredible how it works. Would you know how it actually stores it without ever touching the internet? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:21:11
I'm not entirely sure what a seed is. A paper wallet you generate it on a website (offline) then print it out and it has a public key and your personal access key to send bitcoin to. Is that the same?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:36:15
Check your bank, the transaction may have cancelled. Happened to me.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:55:37
I'm gonna scribe the code on some metal as well actually. That way if the paper burns, the metal will most likely won't melt! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:32:05
It grazed it, then it went back up... Any guesses as to what caused it?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:47:58
The mentality is to play it *safe*. In the long run, your bitcoin will gain a lot of value, regardless of highs and lows. You'll ultimately gain.
With buying the lows and selling the highs, you're gambling. You can be right once in a while, but it takes one bad jump to get off the train and it leave you behind.

Thanks bitbruther
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:27:13
Let's fuckin go!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:02:36
I put little increments at a time... Kinda feeling it out. Had I put all the accrued purchases from the get go, I'd have more bitcoin than I do now since it's been up and up. Take that with a grain of salt cause you could potentially put your chunk in and then bitcoin take a nose dive. Just follow the golden rule of: 'invest money you can lose' and you should be gold regardless. 
Good luck and welcome to the bitcoin train!
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:15:51
I'm tempted to sell but quite honestly, this shit is unpredictable. So hodling. Wish I knew what was going to happen and I'd give you an answer man lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:21:35
Count me in, why not?
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:01:35
Yeah! Or it being stacked against the stock market, dollar value, etc
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:47:27

He was posing as a weak trader who was about to panic sell. But it was the opposite once you opened it. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:57:54
What do you do for a living if you don't mind us knowing?
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:59:43
For wanting to know when it exactly happens, you sure don't have much of a plan! lol 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:22:22
What are your plans for when it forks man?
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:21:40
Or why don't you diversify? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:48:28
This would be /oldpeoplefacebook material only until you look at the OPs history
