What did you for taxes when you converted back to fiat? I haven’t sold any btc but reading up on it it’s definitely a grey area.

Both I’d say. Lots of people from all walks of life. A decent chunk are educated professionals that see it as a possible big payoff if it succeeds or an unfortunate gamble if not. Most are relatively young and know we can bounce back if it all goes to shit, or stop working if it moves in the opposite direction. I’d love for it to one day be a universal currency, but I think most people just see it as an investment gamble for now... hopefully that will change!

Mind giving us a brief summary then? Nothing extensive, but a TLDR of General tax advice would be great.

Least it’s better than the guy that bought some of mine at 19.4K... Limit sell that I didn’t think would actually execute during all the craziness.

That’s pretty scary when you lay it out like that. Thanks for the explanation.

Absolute zero evidence honestly, just anecdotal posts and guesswork after reading the forum for a few months and discussing with friends. What’s your take on the demographics so far?

I’ve had a few altcoins lose me thousands within an hour - I know the pain lol. I’ve made decent money from alctoins as well - such is the roller coaster of crypto.
