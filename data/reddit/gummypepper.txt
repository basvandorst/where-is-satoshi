This is how I handle risk when buying used products (in general), I personally don't believe buying used computer parts has a significantly higher risk either.
The risk is based on my personal level of trust.
risk of bad  product = 10%
risk of warranty usage within lifespan = 5%
price (new) = 500
price (used) = 300
Actual price for the used product is then 345 when accounting for risk. (300 * 1.15)
I have never gotten a bad deal when buying anything used, so I consider it to be very low risk. 
So I consider the odds of buying the same GPU used and getting scammed twice is 0.1 * 0.1 which is 1%.
But of course if I get scammed the risk is 10% again on the next deal, but that is the cost of buying used. You sometimes get a bad deal, but in the long run you save a lot of money. 
However it helps to know a bit about the general  lifespan of the product. PSUs have a much shorter lifespan then CPUs for instance.

I can't give you an exact answer but I think you need to use an older version of electrum to restore with 12 words. I ran into a similar problem a while ago. Not sure if it was 12 words for me or something else, but it was not supported until i downloaded a previous version. 2.7 or something.

If you don't have any funds in your wallet you might as well. But 12 should be enough (security wise)
But remember this:
The seed and private key is private. Do not under any circumstances share it. That also means be careful where you copy paste it. A website or software offering to convert it or help you might copy the key. 
There's lots of money to be made tricking people. 
Be paranoid, read about things before you use them for serious funds.

You will probably pretty easily restore your wallet. If you need an old version of electrum you can find it on the electrum page a bit hidden iirc

I bought at 8k and Bitcoin had more than doubled the last month, I'd say no. Not to late.
Of course you might lose everything and buy all time high.
