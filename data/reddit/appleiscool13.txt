Its time to "export my data"

Found out that it is run by light speed systems and probably there is a list that is automatically blocked. Then the school can add their own blocks in later.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:20:06
I think all they use is coinbase
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:09:37
Right now whenever I get BTC I put it in a spreadsheet and put the amount, how much it was worth, when I got it. and whenever I spend it 
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:01:06

Yes! There is one in our small town the problem is no one knows what bitcoin is here so if I go there they will probably be like what's that
@_date: 2015-07-27 03:15:33
