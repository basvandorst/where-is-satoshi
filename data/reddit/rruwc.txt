As a reminder, in December 2013 Cameron Winklevoss posted the following statement on Reddit, regarding a valuation for Bitcoin:


He has since refused to engage anyone questioning his valuation. His arithmetic is incorrect (as the point where 10m bitcoins were in circulation had passed a year and a half prior to his post), and his valuation from that point is completely unexplained while likely being based on essentially wishful thinking. His valuation requires a 200 fold increase in the market capitalization for Bitcoin while millions of Bitcoins magically disappear from the market.
I see no reason to trust his BTC-USD calculator when he can't even manage simple calculations himself. His statements and actions have been incredibly self serving and, to include the point above, downright fraudulent. He is attempting to create an investment product based around Bitcoin but seems to be incapable of the most simple Bitcoin related valuation.
If Bitcoin wants to be successful, the community can't stand to have blatant shysters attempting to make a quick buck off of peoples ignorance.

The hundred thousand of people using bitcoin now are hardly evidence for its adoption as a currency - it's rampant with dumb speculators who saw it at $1200 and bought in to the foolish notion that it was going to go higher reliably.

Cool "u angry bro??" response. Lmao
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:47:03
Look, the equation here is very simple. Market capitalization / shares = share price. He claimed a market capitalization of $400bn. He claimed a per share value of $40k. 400bn / x = 40k. x = 10m. That means that, at this theoretical future time when the Bitcoin market cap is approximately 200 times higher than it is today, the amount of bitcoin outstanding will be equivalent to the mid-2012 level. He posted that statement a year and a half after 10m coin outstanding was reached. 
You can disagree with this math all you want, but you will be wrong, just like he was. There is no discussion to be had on the subject.


You need to support your claim by posting your analysis. I can't wait to see this.


It's not legally a pump and dump because it's not a regulated security. That is why people like the Winklevii love it. It's an unregulated market so those with the capital to do so are able to easily manipulate the market. And just look - he has people coming to his aid to defend errors in his arithmetic. He has found a market where the participants are so unsophisticated that he can post blatantly false math and when he gets called out on it, adherents to the market will rush to his side.


This is such an incredibly childish statement. I would say it borders on a cult-esque mentality, but it's well past the border. You've forsaken any logic and analysis for your faith. Congratulations.

Your denominator is invalid. You may try again with a different value. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:22:05
If market cap stayed the same price would be decreasing slightly as the amount of coin in the market grew. 
You seem to think that you have found a flaw in my argument but you haven't. Market cap stagnation is referring to how it peaked months ago and has failed to grow significantly since falling from that peak, as measured over a 4 month time period. It can still experience significant intraday, week, and month price volatility while maintaining a semi-stable market cap over a longer period of time.

@_date: 2014-04-11 23:58:58
Because the denominator is fraudulent?
He gives you all but one number of the equation. 400bn is the numerator, 40k is the quotient. You need only solve for the denominator, which is 10m. We know that the 10m number is false, as there are already more bitcoins in existence than that and there were more in existence than that at the time of his writing (and had been for about a year and a half).
That is why his valuation is fraudulent. Considering he refuses to articulate it any further when he is engaged, in his AMA or in subsequent threads, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that his valuation was reached through fraudulent or just plain incorrect means.
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:02:05


That's right, he posted on Reddit that Bitcoin could be worth $40,000 a coin, or roughly 2/3rds the value of replacing every single USD in circulation with a Bitcoin. I mean, his fucking math in that post isn't even correct! He literally couldn't even be bothered to stop and do 400bn / 21mm for the sake of his scam. Or I guess the best case scenario is that he purposely used the 2012 scarcity values against some indeterminate date in the future when the market cap is $400bn, which is intellectually fraudulent in and of itself.
Absolutely fucking absurd. I called him out on it in that thread, provided analyst assessments from reputable firms completely contradicting his claim, and he ignored it. I readily invite to come to this thread to defend his statements, but I seriously doubt he will do so since he didn't even have the balls to defend it at the time. 
I have never seen such a bald-faced pump-and-dump / case of fraudulent advertising for personal gain (and this is generously assuming dishonesty on his part as opposed to just blatant ignorance toward his investments). This is penny stock boiler room level shit.
Edit: It's beautiful that this post is getting downvoted without anyone successfully articulating how his statement was anything but completely fraudulent. That's a good look for the Bitcoin community.

Of course you don't. I would just assume you were a ~sick internet troll~ but I took a look at your OkCupid profile where you have posted a bunch of comments from people on Reddit, so I think it's safe to say you're just really dumb.
And I guess you won't be posting your analysis on how Bitcoin could be worth more than $40k? Probably because you have done no analysis of your own? That sounds an awful lot like what you admonished others for in your previous posts.

That time period would have been over a year and a half prior to his post. If he knows anything about Bitcoin, which he purports to and he should given that he is attempting to create an investment product based on the cryptocurrency, he would know that. His post was an intentional attempt to mislead readers. Reddit should be angry at him for believing they were dumb enough to fall for it, not attempting to give him leeway.
So he was wrong in arithmetic at the minimum. Beyond that, his speculation as to the coins future value is incredibly dubious (I mean, it's wrong and absurd, but I'm just being nice), and would still result in a market capitalization that is roughly a third of all USD in circulation at the 2012 Bitcoin circulation levels. So at some magical point in the future when the Bitcoin market cap has swelled literally 200 fold, he is using numbers from almost 2 years ago now to perform his math. That is intellectually fraudulent, and he knows that. Or if he doesn't, he is an idiot.
His valuation was fraudulent, period. Again, I invite to come here to defend it, but considering that every time someone has asked him about it on Reddit he has refused to acknowledge it, I'm going to go out on a limb and say he's too much of a coward.

There is literally no guarantee of this and leading economists/financiers generally agree that Bitcoin makes horrible money due to it's failings as a store of value, which will likely preclude it from ever being more than a niche item.
I know loves to argue that volatility will stabilize with wider adoption but that is a chicken/egg issue wherein you won't get much more in the way of capital infusion into the market without greater stabilization and you won't get greater stabilization without more capital.
Bitcoins market cap growth has been pretty stagnant for going on 4 months now and what growth has existed (especially prior to this time period) is largely speculators, not transactional users.
In essence, what I am getting at is that it appears that Bitcoin has already begun to stall out, little less 5 years from now. I imagine that it will likely revert to it's original use - hiding transactions for illicit goods on the internet. Maybe with the added use of people attempting to avoid taxes on transactions, which will add regulatory and IRS scrutiny, which will damage Bitcoin further as a currency.

The fluctuations of the USD are magnitudes smaller than Bitcoin. 
If your contention is that Bitcoin is currently tapped out and sitting at its stable point, I would agree. It looks like most of the growth is done. I believe there will be some potential contraction of the market as the rest of the speculators cut their losses and leave, but this may be counterbalanced by some of the merchants who intend to accept Bitcoin lagging behind a bit.
In essence, it's a niche market (as most reasonable people who did not buy into Bitcoin hysteria saw it) and it looks that it will stay that way.

I doubt very many people want to conduct remittance when, by the time the money can be taken out and put into a local bank, could be worth half as much as it was when it was sent.
