This fund is all mining stocks though. It doesn't actually track the price of gold.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:05:27
I bet tons of people would buy it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:28:33
Vanguard doesn't do gold either.

We are better than that. Bitcoin Cash doesn't even have 1/10 the transactions that bitcoin has. I'm more interested to see what happens in January, when coinbase releases everybody's BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:22:55
Yea,I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:08
Great article. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:42:17
That is amazing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:34:51
Shows what I know. I'm not privy too those insider trading tips.

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:57
I did a fear buy.   Price was too good. I could no longer resist.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:00:22
I'm running a full node and using the coin that I believe in. I share my opinion with anybody who wants to know why I choose BTC over BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:02:00
Exactly. We can all just sit back and enjoy the show. I for one sold BCH a while ago and will not be getting back in.

Come back when you have managed to get your money out of Korea. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:32:50
I sold around $300 since I don't believe in it. I think I'll hold my BTG in case it gets pumped for no reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:13:58
You can login to GDAx.com with your coinbase info. You can then transfer out of gdax to your wallet for no fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:01:38
Bitcoin cash is superior to bit coin, because they only need to process 26,000 transactions per day. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:45
Why is there so much begging in here?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:36
You're basically playing with free money. I sold at $300. Still profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:15
I sold at $300. Maybe A little regrets, but it is still profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:27
Of course dad has probably been telling you to sell since $900. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:43:13
What does wall street have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:22:14
Threads like this are strange. What is the point? Bitcoin can coexist with other alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:29:39
I just transfer to GDAX and then transfer for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:55:12
There are currently about 10x more sell orders than buy. This should be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:38:47
Give him yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:11
Yea, I'm hanging on to BTG... just in case. GDAX is post only right now. They say they'll start trading once there is enough liquidity.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:20:33
That was actually a really interesting article. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:28
What exactly would you like this fork to do?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:27:19
Pest control products?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:26:42
Why not move it to gdax and transfer for free?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:35
I considered buying with a credit card, but missed it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:32
This is the best way to look at it. I sold everything at $1300 thinking it would go down, instead it shot to $3000. I bought back in and have no regrets. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:17
Something something 11:30, dragon slayer, flippening? I'm curious to see what happens to BCH in January after coinbase releases all that BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:07
That was more amusing than I thought it would be. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:27:59
Too bad I didn't read it back in 2011. Maybe I would have bought a ton of BTC and sold it all at $29. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:12
The orders aren't getting completed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:35:26
How do people follow this guy?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:34:41
Oh, like the dollar?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:43:35
I don't know if it's impossible. I just don't know anybody that has managed to do it. One of my buddies is trying to open an account with HSBC. Korea has pretty strict rules about sending money out of the country and foreigners opening bank accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:39
If people want to use BCH, let them. Just because we don't believe in it and know it isn't a long term solution doesn't mean they can't value it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:33:28
That means your wife is insane. Sorry, bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:37:56
I had to google it. I guess I don't know much about white supremacists. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:37
Can you only buy right now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:13:51
Gemini looks pretty good, but I don't think I can bring myself to leave GDAX's $0 maker fee. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:19:23
Also, if ETF gets approved, buy more
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:18:51
Buy, then if ETF gets denied, buy more. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:13:24
Good plan hodl forever. If I get unrealized losses, I'll just but and hodl even more. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:55:00
This makes me want to throw everything I own into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:14:48
Why did you leave out 2018?
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:20:16
I'll probably buy right at the peak. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:17:06
Good plan. hodl forever. If I get unrealized losses, I'll just buy and hodl even more. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:59:36
My transfer failed to go through and I missed out on buying 2.6 BTC @ 914. Feels bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:44:29
I sold at 314. No regrets. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:37:55
If you believe in the future of BTC, there is no reason to sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:01:32
I sold mine a couple weeks ago at $310. I don't think I regret it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:39:06
In general, Coinbase does not charge a fee to use our Hosted Digital Currency Wallet service. Transfers of virtual currency to an address off the Coinbase platform may incur network transaction fees, such as bitcoin miner’s fees, which Coinbase may pass through to you. Any such transfer fees will be disclosed to you at the time of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:40:24
Are you talking about bcash?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:25:13
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:37:44
What's the problem?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:58:18
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:44:28
I'm waiting for BCH to plummet. I feel kinda bad for all the people that bought into it. It's very clearly being manipulated. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:45:14
Not really
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:35:12
I doubt it. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:18:21
Baakkt isn't real?
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:20:21
What is OTC?
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:08:34
Maybe buying Bitcoin on credit was a poor life choice. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:47:32
That's great news. Fees are way down too. I've never seen the unconfirmed transactions this low. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:02:19
That would be a good way to make me stop paying taxes. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:51:40
Will it make you feel better if I tell you I just won .02 BTC on the Superbowl?
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:40:25
What proof do you have that they bought?
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:07:26
Its really just about ASIC boost. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:09:38
Yea, I don't get it either. I mean, you could just not pay taxes. I'll probably pay taxes though. Meh
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:11:51
We shouldn't pay taxes on capital gains from BTC then. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:57:36
Pretty interesting. I wish I bought the dip. I couldn't move my money fast enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:52:40
I guess the US dollar will never fail either.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:22:54
I would wait until after the ETF decision on May 15th. If it remains denied it will probably drop 35% again. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:30:30
So you think that the recent rally has nothing to do with the SEC reviewing their decision?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:49:07
Its a good idea to never keep coins on coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:21:52
Prove yourself right. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:27:37
I really like my Trezor, but like everybody said, as long as you control your keys, its all good. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:19:32
Basically, if you were leaving your coins on an exchange, like coinbase, you are not in control of the coins, coinbase is. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:22:07
Trying to catch a falling knife could never go wrong. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:06:05
You should take a class on how to make an argument. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:33:48
I'm not panicking. I'm actually trying to catch the falling knife.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:03:01
I took profits at $1500. No point in complaining about profit, but I should have just held.
