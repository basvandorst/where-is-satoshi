dude, i MIGHT have two coins or less.  if i put a lot of effort into btc back then don't you think i would have done something about it earlier....  actually, no. i'm not going to get trolled by you.  i don't know what your problem is.  i already got the info i needed from some helpful redditors.  fuck off, asshole.

and the phrase is "would have", not "would of"

um... i don't know how to respond to this.  i had a laptop and did not mine for a long time.  i was in a mining pool and also bought some btc off ebay.  I'm sorry that you think i'm lying...?  i'm ok with that though...

ok, i see.  you're just a presumptuous dick.  is this how you interact with people in real life?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:30:26
you're an idiot.

why does nothing add up?  how could i not just have 2 coins?  what would i benefit by lying about this?  what do you think my game is?  i'm 35 and bored at work, my sister texted and told me she invested in btc last month and made some money, i told her i might still have some on my old laptop, she told me i should research it because the price is high right now(?), then I subscribed to and posed my question.
why would i lie?  what do you think i am up to?  i'm just curious at this point.

It may have been 2010, 2011, 2012, I don't exactly remember but it's irrelevant. I never possessed more than two coins.

kids can't have informed opinions?  Seems like a long shot that this 12 year old is so concerned about banking on her own, but the kids advocating for the environment and gun policy--you think they're not genuine?
EDIT: You know what, I retract my question.  I can already hear your answer... 
 save your breath.
