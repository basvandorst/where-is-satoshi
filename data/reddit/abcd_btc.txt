dont worry, and have faith in the one and only true bitcoin with the longest block chain.
Yes bcash increasing block size is a good workaround now, but long term does not scale, and storage becomes an issue where bitoin can no longer be decentralized but run by centralized big companies.
The attack against bitcoin is obvious, but all i can say, those who believe in bitcoin continue to use and support it, those who do not get out and find your altcoin.
Bitcoin will hit big...have patience..\

i have heard that happens in the America as well. Find a credit union, if they are available in your country. they might not give you any issues.
