He is assuming bitcoin market cap would be 21 trillion USD.

Just curious to know where have you read about bitcoin back then?

"Temporary solution: disable BTC email confirmations."
Works like a charm!

I am a newbie, quick question: Can I issue BTC payments to 2 addresses in one transaction or do I have to issue 2 transactions?

I think you should also ask what is your net worth range and age. 
i.e: if someone is in is 20's and his net worth is up to, say, $20k, he might be 50% in bitcoin which can't be compared to someone else who's net worth is $500k and is 50% in Bitcoin.

So how come he states a number x20 times as much?

I just got my Trezor and I wrote down the seed. Is there a way to test that the seed is correct (i.e: that I wrote it down correctly) without compromising the wallet keys?

I am not sure if I would put 50k in BTC right now if I were you but I would definitely put another 20k at current price. If price drops to below 250 I would put another 20k. i don't think it's too risky. You need to take risks to make money and this is not that high risk considering your age and net worth.

Yes, OFC Bitcoins can only be stored on the blockchain. I see your point. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:58:55
What do you mean,  The way I understand  reply is that these exchanges keep their member balances accounting internally, off the blockchain. Why would you say what you are saying?

 awesome. License wise, can the code be used in a commercial product?

Price rose from 200 to 1000 within a month and a half between end of October to December 2013. Part of it was due to manipulation of untrustworthy exchanges like mtgox and Chinese exchanges. I Believe that once we hit 200+ we will be at where people think we should have been and a true rally will begin.

Thanks for explaining. So when will one of the alt coins start to use it? As soon as they would implement their alt coin on side chains? Sorry for my lack of understanding, am just trying to figure out what it takes for sidechains to first be used

Ya, I want to go long and my question is this, how can I go LONG with leverage so that I can, for example, get x times the BTC I deposit to Bitfinex and assuming price goes up I benefit the leverage. If price goes down a certain gap, I have my position closed and the Bitcoin I deposited are used to cover the loss?

How would one use OpenBazaar? Would I have to use Tor to access the site? Please explain the decentralized part of it.

Yes, I realize that I need to further research. That is why I posted this question on reddit because I wasn't sure which path to take when the characteristic of the service I needed  was that Bitcoins are mostly coming in for member account funding while still instant withdrawals of Bitcoins need to also be allowed. 
I also looked at multisig solution which allows a more transparent service by allowing members to control their wallets even if the service goes down, apart from the increased security aspect. I wasn't just sure if this wasn't a too complicated solution for a problem addressed in a simplified manner by current exchanges.
I will further research this but any help from you guys and others is also a way for me to find the right path. Would love to hear more.

I am asking because assuming I want to setup a Bitcoin exchange, would it be ok these days to pre-generate bitcoin public keys, have them assigned to new members so they can fund their accounts and have on a seperate computer a hot wallet for payments to "external" addresses, maintaining my internal balance accounting for members. This way I can limit my losses in case of a security breach to say 10% of total site balances, as long as my hot wallet only has up to 10% of total system balance. 
In regards to your question, it means that I hold the private key.
Does this sound a good way to go? All assuming much more money stays inside the system then money that needs to leave out.

Is there a reason why you can create up to 10 private keys?
public static final int PRIVATE_KEY_OF_HOT_COUNT_LIMIT = 10;

How about stock markets not crashing without the QE? Would it be possible that bitcoin will weaken in the coming months till the end of the year?

Sure no problem. In short, people post projects for freelancers to bid on them. Awarded bidder is paid in bitcoin as well as employer needing to fund his project with bitcoin.
