Good lessons are expensive, you just paid a different school... Learn from it or repeat.

Employ someone digitally. Pay them in fiat. 
Employ someone digitally. Pay them in (agreed crypto of choice).
Case in point.

Is that how you personally invest? I won't take a loan against property that I'm not willing to lose. Diversified investments are supposed to be done with long range expectations, not get rich quick schemes...

I use Blockfolio.

I'm seeing a lot of purchases on the platform I use... This is like an exciting horse race, at the moment.

It will be bouncing back, just like the rest of it's entire digital history.

I think that's a conservative estimate.

If you put all your eggs in one basket and the bottom falls out, that's a good lesson. If you want to rage quit, stick to video games.

I just turned 3 k into 18k in a month lol
Crypto is in it's infancy, however there are actually real life people who simply transfer currencies (fiat) between exchanges, buying low and selling when it's high. The problem I see here is the unrealistic expectations placed on one's ability to forecast a dice roll... 
Investing 101:
Stick to what you know, learn from your mistakes, and educate yourself on what you don't know.

I personally believe in btc as a means to be adopted by the masses (eventually) for the expanding digital commerce markets... Industrial import and export will be the main platform for risk management and support, driving the value up and saving these larger companies (like Amazon for example) massive amounts of fiat dollars. 
-Digital technology is indispensable, and still in its infancy; what a time to be alive!

Neither explained their usage lol

Agreed! I got in early. I've been using it for purchases to help support it... Now I'm going to refill the coffers, as I'm able.
