If there is a licesning mechanism who runs it? This is quickly becoming less and less decentralized (even though you failed to do the order book and matching in a decentralized way).
So I just have to steal enough to make up for the lost security deposit? Doesn't seem well thought out.

They are relying on the addition of a feature that doesn't exist yet in Bitcoin and atomic swaps don't work. That may be formatted like a scientific paper but its not, and its not peer reviewed.
Anyone who makes a decentraliezd exchange would release the matching and settlement engine first because that is the only part that matters and is difficult to do and it would need peer review. All I see is a UI and a failure to handle the orderbook in a decentralized way.

Feels more appropriate on a game.

Except this solution fails to decentralize the trading book and trading engine. They could easily run scams in this system.

They have built a UI and completely failed to build a working decentralized trading engine. The hard part of the decentralized exchange is not the orderbook and UI, its figuring out how to make it impossible to cheat people during a trade. Yet everyone freaks out because like always they can't see through a simple facade.

Thats the thing the problem wasn't we needed a nice GUI it was that settlement in a decentralized way is difficult. Without out that, this project is fluff.
