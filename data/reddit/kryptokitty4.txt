Why lol? 
Though looking at it now, It does look shady af. Shit.
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:50:58
That's exactly what I'm talking about :)

If you don't find anything, let me know!
I just lost access to all my wallets and need to buy some numbers/fullz, will happily split the profit or have something cool sent to you? :D

It's saying you have to transfer the amount to fund the site wallet.
Would you like me to link you the site so you know I'm not bullshitting you?
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:41:39
I don't have a wallet anymore, that's why I can't do it for myself D:

I don't want money, just an avenue to be able to send my own money to a vendor. Was hoping someone would be able to help a gal out ��

Oh! Would that allow me to buy what I needed? That's incredibly kind of you. I'd be happy to show or tell you what i'm doing as I go just so you know i'm not full of shit. and if it doesn't pan out how I wanted or promised, I can transfer you the cash back the normal way.

They all need verification before you can make a purchase and I don't have my physical ID.
