Thanks for the constructive critique! What would've you suggested?
As a precaution, I added the same link on the Udemy course page so I can prove it's not a scam:

So this is why cex.io ghash value is in the toilet at the moment?

Protip: don't use "destroy" and "airport" in the same sentence.

Why is there no price (in BTC) before checking out?

Wait, so you send them coins and then you can spend it with your card, right? What guarantees they won't just up and leave with all deposited coins?
After all the scams we've been thru recently (well, since ever tbh), maybe this should be taken with a grain of salt? I'm trying to access Belize's International Financial Services Commission at ifsc.gov.bz to check up on their license, but keep getting a 403 error.
Just saying, it's smelling a bit fishy.

Doesn't buy and hold hurt the market?

Guys, I'm the real hacker. You can trust me. I hacked Bitstamp bypassing it's firewall internet using nothing more than a triple-algorithm to encode a self-sentient hydra virus hidden within an RNA nitrous oxide trojan horse, disabling all IPs worldwide. So there is your proof.
Instead of selling the coins though, I want you to send me more to another of my wallets and I'll give those ones all back.
