doesn't sound good lol

none, but from what I read there is no 100% certanity with neither 
what are you reading?

3 hops meaning the mix is done 3 times
since the analysys gives only % of confidence, when you do it 3 times it reduces that graetly

read the actual research
and note that they are using 3 hops at least
tell me what you found?

It wasn't proven to be useless but that it is helpful to a degree
only percent of the transactions can be reveled with certain confidence.
Anyway, I still would like to know what is going on with them?

I dare you to provide the source.
I actually have read the analysis by Kristov Atlas and it wasn't perfect but not even remotely 100% useless. People stop talking without actually knowing the facts.

I went ahead and read it again the whole thing at 
"Despite the limitation, the tool was able to group 69% of inputs and 53% of the transaction’s outputs"
"In January 2015, the company contacted me to claim that they have fixed the issues identified in this advisory"
So it's good up to 53% per mix, and by default the tool makes 3 to 5 "runs" of the mix. 
So it's easy and inexpensive way to make the following from super simple to really complex and possibly remove 100% certainty. 
So depending on your needs, it has it's place.
Please show me which part of the research shows it's 100% useless? 
yeah I thought so. 
and and not to mention they made it better since then
