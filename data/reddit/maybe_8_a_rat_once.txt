Thanks . 
I’ve just set up my cold storage so I’m fine with that and I plan on buying and holding not spending so I’m just going to avoid hot wallets completely for now. 
I’ve taken a look at the pi (I already use arduino for other stuff so it’s not much of a jump).  I’ve read that it can take quite a while to sync the Blockchain with this setup though. Can you estimate how long it you to fully sync?
Thanks for the links as well, super useful information.

Congrats man, I'm still running from mine. If you can't see them they can't see you, right?

So I gave it a good few hours today and I'm up to number 4! Slow going but I want to understand so I don't mind the grind. I'll post my answers here when I'm finished and If you don't mind OP you can let me know if you think I'm getting it!

Sorry if this has already been asked but I’m curious. 
I’d like to run a node and was thinking about getting a cheap laptop or possibly building a desktop for this purpose running a Linux distro . If I go ahead is it safe for me to use that computer  for my electrum wallet? Also what do I need to consider in terms of security? Any help would be appreciated.

I did exactly the same thing, not the usenet bit but buying at $9000. I'd been following BTC and other cryptocurrencies for a few years but never had the money to buy. Got a bit of cash recently and thought, fuck it, right now is the second best ever time to buy so why not. Now I'm considering if I should get HODL FAST inked on my knuckles to stop me from getting weak hands!

I had a dream last night that showed me the way, HODL for life.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:15:42
That is awesome and exactly what I needed to know, articulated in a way I can understand and implement. Thank you!

Wow thanks for this, I’m a noob too and I can answer about 5 things on your list. I know what I’m doing today!

I’m a BTC newb and I say HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:22:08
Exactly what I'm doing. HODL FAST sailor.
