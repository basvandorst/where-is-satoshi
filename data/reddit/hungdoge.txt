Just buy a bit each month. Then you won't care about wild swings
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:02:34
I get the whole......"Has it made any money yet?" "Why don't you cash it out then?" ..... That pretty much ends all attempted conversation
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:03:01
Also a classic that you see rolling around today! Maybe custom build a lambo on the civic engine?
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:05:29
Just like we still "need" prints, I like to out them in frames occasionally...so technically there is still a market here it's just smaller...and there are better and easier options
@_date: 2019-07-20 10:11:33
U say this like it's a bad thing, the 1997 Corolla was perhaps one of the greatest cars ever made, cheapest to run and never broke down. One visit to the shop in with a lambo would cost you more than running costs on this car for 5 years! Hodl the Corolla!!

Isn't it better to say 98% think Bitcoin is better?
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:33:20
I'd agree with this, ran the numbers overheads are high, unless you are in a popular location you may not even break even
@_date: 2019-03-07 03:33:17
This is all good convo but let's be honest, the biggest "adoption product" if that's a wallet app or company or something that we haven't seen that will bring the next millions of users into the game ....they will be the ones to pick and have it wide spread enough that it will be the only one used. Time will tell.
@_date: 2019-03-09 21:21:07
Same thing for me except my card was duplicated somewhere I used it...5 days to replace. People attempted to use the card at 3 different locations, this would not be able to happen with Bitcoin, no one can duplicate my private key and spend my money!

I want one!!! Doesn't show the potentially long kyc process however, I'd love to see a demo on that? (The 5 mins before this success), so good though!
@_date: 2019-11-02 12:50:33
I mean I'm on a 10/10 connection and it's a cheap but decent mini media pc.. better than a raspberry pie for sure so I really don't know what's up with it. I do wonder if I should increase connections count like what was suggested further up here .

I guess I should put this also in r/showerthoughts

18hours to download and sync? What am I doing wrong? Mine has taken 2 weeks and I'm only on 65%
@_date: 2019-11-20 17:13:46
Exactly... This is it! It becomes awkward because they don't know that what they are asking is actually rude.
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:03:26
Haha thanks for the compliment, but no I'm yet to make the plunge into anything, only made enquires with 1 manufacturer so far. It's all unknown territory for me
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:38:30
Absolutely this ^^ they are taking all the risk on the set up, fees, rent of space, licencing etc...
@_date: 2019-08-04 19:40:48
Love to see this info graphic translated to English...any volunteers ?
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:42:16

Gezzus, that's how much a licence costs? Sheesh
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:56:44
Forget that....at that point move to a different country with low or no taxes ...wait a while then cash some out or just invest the btc into a high interest btc account (likely will be plenty by then) ...or spend btc instead of cash...even if no vendors accept it there will be (already are) plenty of crypto credit  cards out there
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:08:59
I already know this is a cringe video without watching it. .....uggggh Peter just needs to stop self promoting, we all know he owns Bitcoin and will do very well from it.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:05:22
True, self control is required for any type of card. If you knowingly don't have it, don't get a card in the first place
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:25:43
So true, a good allocation of shit coins is a great idea..  pick a few from the top 50-150 range...if Dec of 2017 told me anything this will work out . ..until it doesn't
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:19:11
Can we see the same but using "SATs"?
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:10:06
Too bad, I would buy it off your at market price...just to avoid the  fee from buying such a small amount....u can always try "localbitcoins" which helps u find buyers in your local area
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:18:50
make a deal with a friend and then just transfer them the bitcoin and then take cash off them
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:36:14
If a cc is the only means to buy then just make sure u pay the cash back into the card immediately .... At least with cc u will get some points of cash back that might cover the fees!!
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:06:46
Lightning. .... Mr 3 months
@_date: 2019-08-13 02:57:56
With such a small amount how will this person avoid the sats getting eaten by fees?
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:09:30
Huh? Sure enough he is Aussie u mean....racist
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:10:54
"Straya" is the correct spelling
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:53:07
Or.....they take over satoshis fortune on the dormant address, assume the identity and say they (us gov) created Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:58:21
This is awesome! Go pomp!
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:58:18
Not really this...most ATMs buy at market on the spot of the sale...they don't hold the btc for longer than the transaction takes to get on to the buys phone after the purchase has been made
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:48:49
Sorry I meant fees when purchasing...not network..
 Perhaps there are places I don't know where you can get low purchase fees on buying say 100bucks worth
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:29:17
Haha love the last point here!
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:07:02
Said the guy who's had a Reddit account for 3 months
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:51:44
Pointing out that perhaps they don't know much about btc either if they have only been here for 3 months

thanks for this info! can i ask what sort of location have you put yours in? also did you have to register it as a business?
@_date: 2019-02-21 02:12:57
love to pick your brain further even with more questions as i get into this, mind if i DM you?

Love to hear comments on " Wallet of Satoshi "  been using it for a while, however it is custodial but amazingly easy to use and transfer real btc in and out! Anyone had a tech deep dive?

Wasn't it 100 million from Daddy?
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:01:30
This is amazing. So...I'm trying to see where this will be when we are at a point of e.g. 10,000 btc capacity (yes I realise this is far off) ... Wondering however what will this bring with it...
1. could someone avoid buying btc on chain all together and instead buy lightning btc instead? Maybe there will.be vendors that sell it already on lightning ready to go? 
2. At this kind of capacity and let's say 250,000 channels what would be the ability of the network? I ask because I have no idea..
Generally speaking what is the utimate goal of lightning? To have ALL small (e.g. under 100usd) daily small transactions globally? And if so.what would it take?
@_date: 2019-01-31 02:56:40

For a start I think negative interest rates will be the norm (in a lot of countries)..meaning there is a huge incentive to move cash out of banks earning nothing and into something seen as stable or able to get a return (or both) ...is that Bitcoin? I don't know, but at these higher amounts your saying ...your not going to see the price fluctuate when you go to buy a coffee with it which is also a bonus.
