Boom and busts existed viciously in gold-based societies and most of society is deflationary, the inflation is just like 1 or 3 % of the reason why boom and busts happen. Ofc there's a lot of propaganda designed to fish away from the fact.

Good luck with that... If Preet Barbera who is a profoundly corrupt person invented the concept of ''all funds being in Liberty Reserve are suspect'', I highly doubt this guy will get anywhere.

Capital hasn't demonstrated less violence than labour, at all. Labour has its violence, and capital certainly has too, all sorts of violence every day, in intimacy and in big hyper-real events too.
Victorian 'society' sentenced to death for stealing a couple ounces of butter, then commuted these sentences and sent the prisoners to Australia where its class mentality fueled lower class racism, and later systemic murder, of aborigines. Victorian ''society'' was also deeply racist, classist and a certain gender you're probably not of had no rights.
In the aborigines, you had the same system, the strong over the weak, the strong were capital and the weak complained about the village chiefs. Islamic 'society' is similar.
Of course today we have people not saying certain things, and people that have the hubris to preach about how they're ''liberty'' are among the most dangerous because of their confident and unreflective nature. Slavoj Zizek is pretty good at irony in politics, too.

Make me give a shit. Fact is, we had another ''libertarian'' in the midst who, oh surprise surprise, turned out to be of another more ''interesting'' ideological persuasion, the kind even Jane Austen would have strong disgust.

property rights aren't anything new. in 18th century england, it was a victorian belief that there was a so called criminal class, and they had to be put in prison or deported to australia. during the 19th or 20th century, capital would go on to act in many brutal ways, mostly by those saying capital and class belief was really just ''liberty''.
