sorry.. ripple.. XRP
doge from 0.003 to 0.007 in 3 weeks...
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:06:02
well, imagine you have more than 200 000 USD in BTC - in 3rd world country you cannot trust to anyone with that intel...
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:14:58
incredible.. this encryption is just so exciting.. I will study it more...
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:34:26


but what if hw wallet failured? is there any 12 word seed or something like this..?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:13:50
ok but talking strictly about money and gain - is it good coin? I'm not in the cryptos for *philosophy* and changing the world but my financial gain...
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:29:56
yeah.. that's true that you connect in only for the time of transaction - this is something I have forgot...
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:17:15
bcash is bitcoin - this is what they tell to newbies - smart move by my opinion.. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:04
oh man.. I was "playing" with 0.3BTC and shitting my pants.. 
just one advice - DO NOT invest more than you can lose...
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:19:46
check fees - can be bigger than price for room!
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:04:36
I don't have bcash.. only BTC and BTC has ridiculous fees that's why I'm looking at bcash.. or LTC is better?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:10:32
and when it goes from 100 to 1000 and then to 200..? it was also bubble? now was 16000...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:20:18
exactly.. that's why we need ripple - anonymous transactions
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:41:17
There's a little truth in every joke...
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:34:03
is it really necessary? I have heard they are making millions of dollars using google search bar as default...
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:47:08
money.. at the end of the day, it's all about **money**..
I see it as a way out from fucking Eastern Europe poverty shithole...
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:44:55
maybe he is fan of *minimalism* :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:26:10
do not share your private key ever! :)))
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:59:34
luckily, it's not anonymous - every transaction is in the blockchain forever (=untip XTR will overtake the market) so it is traceable...
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:55:52
it's up 50% from yesterday.. have I missed to boat or Bcash will go to the moon too..?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:36:26
that's the spirit...
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:07:34


have you seen ordinary greek citizen life style? it's like wake up at 9, open business at 10, at 12 having 2 hours long lunch and at 4pm already at the beach.. yes.. they did it with the biggest laziness in the world...
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:56:46

@_date: 2017-12-10 13:07:10
*true story bro...*
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:22:05
when I saw that photo of BTC plate I was like - where it was taken..? :)) eastern europe style
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:51:29
oh .. thanks for great explanation! it really change the game, I was thinking that you can sell how many you want at current price but you need also buyers - which makes sense...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:03:22


really? *free money*??? like there was **ZERO** risk when going into BTC with real money? or *ZERO* investments buying miner??
do you even BTC bro..? there's NO FREE MONEY without risk in this Universe...
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:29:17
I saw a documentary - they are just fucking all days long and doing more children even though they don't have anything to eat.. God bless them...
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:24:07
why? you don't transfer 100kUSD every day for your groceries..?
but to be real, many friends have switched to LTC because of the FEES
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:12:22
..OP has already a job where he is getting rich slowly so .. maybe he wanted a change...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:08

@_date: 2017-12-15 09:21:40
exactly.. you *just* believe nanno to produce safe electronic product with NO backdoor - it it is true, they are the first one without backdoor...
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:03:04
I think one big moving to a new apartment and your fragment is lost..
or some big fight between "friends" and they can tell you to fcuk off and you don't have your fragment..  how many great friendships had ended over something very stupid...
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:23:03
no.. because we already had "media attention" I would say...
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:27:51
yeah.. that's the point I'm w8ing for too ha...
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:58:24


I hope too but I'm from eastern europe and know a little that animals called ukraine - he is already dead :/
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:13:26


you had your best lesson to never ask wife with so minor investments - is your wife in cryptology? or from wall street? so WHAT exactly have you been talking with her about? OR it was just her approval to buy? where are your balls faggot...
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:31:10
but BTC is not there for payments.. it's for storing value.. long term HODL...
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:29:30
that feel when you go to another shop were washing 1L (enough for like 3 months) is not 1.49 but 0.9Eur and then later that day you spend another 2000Eur for buying cryptos... :)))
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:44:57
what if 2 miners find the same bitcoin? or it is mathematically very unreal?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:48:35
just want to say that you are a godlike person and this *good* will return to you back x 100 .)
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:45:27

say hello to virgin Sarah for me... ooOOoo
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:19:09
..but you hand write 24 recovery words so.. it *leaves* your hw wallet..
isn't it more safe just to use dedicated older notebook with linux..?
and encrypt keys (seeds) to usb keys? that way you can have ANY passwod you choose, not only 24 very stupid words...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:34
nice chart "rim share price" on google...
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:58:01
like that.. it's NOT about money but about Principe - friend will give you back even if you are a fucking millionaire now!
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:58:41


well.. that was a many years ago.. when the FEE was 0BTC.. right now the fees are TO THE MOON...
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:46
but fees will kill him when he wanna use own wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:44:39
and as I have right now read at another tread, you can hire hitman in Thailand for 0.006 BTC :)))
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:24:18
..what..? from beginning I read and it is all HODL or "I sold all and have no mortgage/students loan now" .. nobody is like "buying a hockey ticket with btc...
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:25:36


this is what I like - the variety.. the variety of the people who are different than me...
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:42:58
ha.. I bought at 4400Eur only 0.2 and then later 0.3 for 10800.. tell me about it...
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:23:49
just share someone name and address - he deserve a little fun to have and he will be finally able to say - *see! I told ya!* :D
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:45:04


shame the girls don't see it that way... :)))
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:17:57
don't forget that fees can make your rent +20%
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:56:16


that's the key.. it's never the greeks company...
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:34:56
it already has - they have the worst nationality to have - fucking ukraine one...
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:33:31


this insider employee hack is still not closed?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:22:48
yes of course.. you know the basic rule *invest only what you can lose*...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:42:06
in the future it could be 2000USD :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:32:43
I spend all money I can risk and have 0.6BTC.. I feel like an fart in the air 1km above the ground...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:38:11
so? apple is private company too :D
but I got your point...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:08:00
buy RIPPLE - byt the end of this year - 5.00USD for one .)
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:27:38
metoo BUT with fees like 20USD for 10USD transaction, bitcoin will be used for HODLing for ever and never become a money...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:13
oh.. well.. good question - I was just thinking to DON'T look at those charts.. I could be playing COD and having fun and not even see this "fall fun".. 
right now I have invested only money what I can lose so I'm ok for now...
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:47:02


send me 1BTC and if you are right, I will send you 2 BACK - or you are just full of shit mate...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:24:46
APPLE = RIPPLE (XRP)
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:00:16
at that shitty country he is already dead :/
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:58:40
oh ok.. but electrum is using 10 randomly selected nodes at once so it should be secure right..?
own node = armory wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:07:13


it's more or less is gamble but you can inform yourself a lot about current situation and have better shots than in casino game...
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:17:26
so you still need offline pc? or?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:46:17
take it like this - they gave you this bonus in price of 10USD - now it is WAY more valuable..
fair play? they *should* give you 10USD in bitcoin in today rate...
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:20:21


are you racist??
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:56
sold at 11,060.5195 EUR
buy at 12,102.4620 EUR
just now :))))))
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:37


unfortunately with current fees it is very bad strategy...
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:47
no, he send money but paid even more in fees - that's the future? XTR is the future...
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:39:59
great.. now 60000USD will be more interesting
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:09:47
you just need to visit the country.. and then visit germany.. or better - work one year in germany and one in greece - it's night and day for lazy people
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:37:02
well.. so big money in game to go to 1dollar...
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:22:19

I'm eastern europe BOT :))

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:29:23

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:17:40
oh.. the cancer of the world, polish people, are here and asking for money.. how original...
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:05:21
he is 30 fucking 4 years old.. with watching youtube videos and learning programming he can be doing money in like 3 months...
he is just lazy as all greeks and that's why it's only fair that germany is having almost everything in greece now.. bigger dog always fuck first...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:59:57
I WANNA BE FUCKING GET RICH QUICK!!!
don't care about future.. about vision.. about great blockchaing technology.. JUST MONEY.. EASY BIG MONEY.. that's my current situation in life... :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:24:18
doesn't matter! will go up to 5USD in the month!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:53:00
hmm.. but if everybody do HODL and no new people will came into the game - the price will be constant right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:00:42
it doesn't matter - all that matters is price right now
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:08:09
is it possible from 3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r to compute private key?? 
like there must be a shit ton of really crazy mathematicians who are doing it right now or..?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:25:33
You have almost the same numbers as I have :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:36:14


he could be dead tomorrow so why to be so precise? we never know for how long we will be there...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:47:39
..do you thing it is possible for you to (maybe in the future) quit your job and do only this for living..?
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:20:03
when selling the car, you go with buyer to the bank and he make a transfer - it's the standard in my country
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:23:47
oh,, well.. I have clearly misunderstood *American dream* as Eastern Europe guy...
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:20:51
WHOLE.. not full.. source: I'm from eastern europe but learning english
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:40:34
badly enough? for 100 bitcoins you are already a dead target in easter europe you can be sure :/
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:39
what???? I know that you must pay like 150000 for all studies but I was thinking that interest is ZERO percent..
and .. to be honest - with USA salaries you can repaid it back very easily like in 5 years or?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:52:02
yeah :DDD
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:25:40
..always split risk .. never put all eggs in one nest...
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:56:09


omg.. I hope some idiot don't make another trend word as HODL
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:18:37
it's a story for his boss to have some support - nothing was stolen.. he still has all the golden coins.. - my humble tip what happend...
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:28:32
it's not about what is the truth but what millions of people hear - that's the real problem...
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:43:32
use shapeshift.io and send BTC directly from wallet to them and create xrp wallet for receiving funds
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:05:41
if I was a good hacker, I would buy a lot of them for 70, modify them and sell on amazon for 39.99! great price right...
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:08:46
this xmass I will give a gift of 0.001 :)) that's my limit but.. it could go up :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:44:08
DO NOT BUY from amazon is common advice here!
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:19:16
electrum ltc org - they have it on the home page
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:47:57
..It was more or less joke :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:11
..it was sarcastic.. like there are 10000 posts that it is just a sale.. great dip.. but nobody knows...
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:05
why you didn't hodl at least one BTC? if I have had 70BTC I would hodl 1 just for fun...
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:44:23


noob question: are you mining? or getting money from fees? or just supporting the network?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:48:00


oh man.. this is really very interesting thinking.. you are right - I didn't ask to be born and I also got this life for free so why be so careful about that...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:28
nope.. that's just *a million dollar question*...
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:56:18
anonymity here helps a lot though...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:23:15
:/ guys here are saying HODL but not a one of them with insurance...
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:23:38
can be.. but it seems that 500000USD/1BTC is never be a reality :/
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:17:31
nobody is *buy stuff and pay bills with*.. everybody is HODLING for life.. to the moon.. so your argument has no sense..
either price will fall down to 1000USD/BTC and people will use it as currency or people will hold forever and price will go up
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:30:04
next time introduce them to *job*
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:51:37


oh man.. you have no idea.. ever been to Switzerland..? follow the gold...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:11:04
so what's the point then? just to see number to your death??
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:45:14
actually, Porsche is better then Benz .)
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:49:05
from amazon can be somehow modified (I read it here) so direct from the company website I guess...
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:55:02
william tell?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:16:30


? what's this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:15:18
..so far.. yes.. but House always wins...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:16:04
you know that you can buy just a fraction of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:42:24
that gipsy country with hot girls is just gambling dirty money in BTC if you want to know what is happening...
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:19:45


that's the point - there are ONLY trezor wallets - so every hacker is focused on this trezor, chipset and so.. I think dedicated notebook, which you power up only for transactions, with encrypted hdd and encrypted backups on some usb keys is the way to go safely...
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:32:44
working with bitcoins on windows machine - that's the rush I don't wanna have...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:21:51
but they don't froze your money right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:44


@_date: 2017-12-14 15:27:06
what are competitors in this? LTC? XTR? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:11:15
well, you should than cash out yesterday because it went from 16777 down to 13000 already.. but w8 for Monday of course...
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:10:20
oh.. so better to buy just a fraction (what if) and don't invest bigger sums of money right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:39:55
ok.. send my 1BTC and if you are right, i will send you more back.. - just to prove that you are not full of shit hmm?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:52:33


it would make sense IF they block INCOMING payments.. not outgoing.. from ordinary people accounts...
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:01:44


that's very true and in eastern europe x1000...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:25:41
or hooker! :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:25:51
yeah like this and not doing fucking memes when price goes up or down - yeah.. very funny when you have mined 200325385 bitcoins a few years ago but not for us, buying a fraction at 16000USD/BTC.. we are not feeling good and amused when HODLing as you are...
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:08:04


noob question here: so if somebody has like 100000 coins and wanna sell them when they are at 8k, he can have a "problem" that not enough people will buy it and so sale will be not successful/ only partially successful? 
there MUST BE asking for every offer to have a deal?????
I was thinking that you can sell it any time when the price is nice for you just like that...
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:05:48
please this! :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:20:59
yes and you can mine at your android phone or microwave own too..
..but it will be not financially reasonable..
just wait for dip to BTC be like 1000USD and buy one
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:55:15
good idea! but for a first step, if every second BTC owner will cancel fucking raiffeisen bank account, I will be happy!
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:10:38


how? where is the seed located? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:05:32
what about XTR and dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:12
edit:  but my prices are little different (bitpanda.com)
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:33
it's true OP.. would you like to know, which day is the best for daytrading?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:23:49
BTC is centralized by 3 biggest miners in China though...
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:49


is it possible to do with electrum wallet???
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:43:00
but he will not sell car for cash but bank transfer - than he is safe even with stolen money receiving but in btc - you never know...
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:44:41
kidnappers downvoted you :)))
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:07:47
10? or 10000? if 10, it's not a *correction*.. it's death...
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:57


I hope not so.. killing yourself for money is never worth it :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:11:13
what does it mean?? that Wall street can trade BTC? if that - it means they need to buy first - so the price will go up.. or?
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:25:10
was that Prince from Nigeria? he desperately needs to transfer a lot of money for years and no good soul wants to help him!

fair enough.. was meant when using desktop - windows and mac are very very unsafe.. just basic linux with autoupdates on is like a tank against a bicycle...

it's about time..
for reference: openBSD bugs are fixed in 1 second, mac os in 2 months (so you are very very long time with unfixed machine AND if you don't follow news, you will have NO idea that you have currently blank root password on appleshit :/
edit: I have macbook air so I'm apple fun but this is really bug of the year...

great! btw I have deleted my wallet and generated new from the word seed - exact same generation as older one so it works :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:24
Thnx :)

sync - that was the word I was looking for! :) thank you for an answer!
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:54:17


great instructions! but with "somewhere" you meant some other location like wifi at my parents house OR some other hardware like another PC?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:35
oh.. was looking for that info on their site but nothing.. ok great! I like electrum more :)

was thinking about trezor but it is very visible that this is crypto trezor.. better maybe to create encrypted archive and save it on a few USB.. usb flash is not so visible what contains...
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:53:15
well.. what about remote access? just give me your IP address.. as a name, I will use root (**really cool name..** can do ANYTHING on your PC..)..
password? don't worry man.. I will just leave it blank... ;)

so, when somebody has one of my address, he cannot ever "connect" my other address? like there are random and not connected in anyway?
like: my first address is: 1 000 000 000 12345
so when I use other what is like 1 000 000 001 12345 - he can compute that this is my other address - it is not possible right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:20:18
yep.. I'm thinking to install OpenBSD just for bitcoin purposes...
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:53:45
Oh :) so.it is not those duck with dog who write like -coz sheeit men.. ok :))
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:56:49


I was thinking that robber can see wallet as wallet but usb can ignore and "just" take computer and so on but I got your point..
another issue is: small usb is cheap today, I can buy 2-3 with the same encrypted archive on it..
but wallet is more expensive to have multiple copies (I have not even 1 BTC so..)
but anyway thanks I will think about it...

it was sarcastic :)))
