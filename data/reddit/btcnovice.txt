They can't make it work.  You can't sell an item that has not recourse against a payment with recourse unless your product is a service that has a negligible incremental cost (phone sex, etc).  
If they had a store and people physically walked in and they have a swipe, then it could fly under the radar.  Again, the base merchant account is fraudulent so any amount of success will bring unwanted attention and closure.

I'm going to tell you how this is going to play out.  
 Firstly you do not have your own merchant account from a recognized bank. You have an aggregator account from a so called "processor".  Visa/MC have no idea who you are (yet).  Your account probably has fees of 8-15% with chargeback fees of 25$ to 50$ per chargeback.
You will start seeing your first charge backs around 3 weeks from now.  You won't be able to dispute them because your account isn't set-up properly and the network won't give two cares about a blockchain when a fedex signed proof of delivery rarely works.  You will lose every chargeback.
Then after about 10 chargebacks (not a big number because you need to understand that not all chargebacks are equal and all of your chargebacks will be coded fraud) you so called "processor" will all of a sudden not be your friend any more and withhold all future settlements from you.  So now your processing rate jumped to 100% (actually more than 100% because they will still charge you the chargeback fees).  
You will then claim you have a contract , and you do but it most likely has a jurisdiction Clause making you need to go to arbitration in Costa Rica.   
This will end badly,  stop now and reorganize.  Realize that if you can't go into your local bank and get processing it's because you shouldn't be processing.  Don't you think that some of the larger players in the market like coinbase with their top notch connections would offer credit cards if it made sense.   Even Marc Anderseen of coinbase couldn't get a legit merchant account for bitcoin if he wanted and backed it with his billions.  
Hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not.

Exactly,   That's why I qualified my answer by saying if they flew under the radar.   The minute that had any kind of success they would be found out

Those are all great but doesn't stop the legitimate bury from saying "it wasn't me".  Each time that happens you will lose the chargeback and be stuck with a $25 to $50 fee.  Do the math..  10$ Margin per transaction (5$ markup, 5$ fee) less 2$ processing fee leave 8$ net profit before sg&amp;a.   Chargeback costs $25 (low end) plus the 20$ bitcoin for total 45$ minimum.   That means 1 chargeback wipes out 9 sales. ( could be 13 sales if fee is 50$)
And those are the friendly chargebacks who know that without prof of delivery all that's required is a phone call saying " I don't recognize that".   Plus since the merchant account is a fraud setup to begin with, the bank clerk won't even have a proper nature if the transaction because 100% certain the account isn't coded to sell Bitcoins.

They wouldn't be underwritten by any legitimate ach provider.  They could be required to put up the equivalent of 6 months of their total excepted ach volume as collateral.

The offshore gaming industry has been trying to bend the rules since 1997.   It doesn't work.  Always ends in fraud by both the processors and the websites.   Even if you walked into Wells Fargo and offered 25,000,000 security to process 5,000,000 a month of bitcoin they would tell you NO.   Visa and MC networks levy huge fines on member banks that have high chargeback accounts and miscode transaction.  It's not unusual for a bank to be hit with 1,000,000 fine for processing 500,000 in transactions.  Ask Credit Agricole in France the amount of their fine for miscoding online gaming in 2003.

They are only selling 2.9% of a BTC.  That's like selling at 25$ something that cost you 19$.  My math is pretty close to accurate.

Not hard when you have a sweatshop in china or Russia with 1000 slaves in front of 1000 computers whose only goal is to defraud.   30 minutes you are done.  Funny part is for the next 2 weeks you will be bragging how successful your business is.

Online gambling only became illegal in 2006 through a bill that was passed in the middle of the night as a compromise to get the Safe Harbours bill passed.   Prior to that it just wasn't liked and was on the wrong side of some old and outdated laws.

I don't need a source,   You can't sell Bitcoin with a credit card.  Just like you can't fund an offshore gaming account.  Credit card companies code transactions by type and block certain codes.  Gaming is 7995 regardless if it's legal or offshore.  Credit card companies and the networks don't care how much money you have, they don't bend the rules.  Don't you think the billionaire owner of Pokerstars would have been able to get a merchant account in USA.   Just my opinion.

If they had a bone fide method to eliminate chargebacks, they should focus on selling that system for millions of $ and forget about trying to  nickel and dime on bitcoin.  In fact, I will start and make an offer of $1,000,000 for the system.

It isn't expensive because the people buying don't care what the price is.  When you chargeback the transaction due to fraud your cost is zero.

It's actually a stupid policy.   You should take whatever payment source your customer has and immediately sell the currency if you don't want to hold it.   
This is just a publicly grab.   They hope a news network picks up on it.

I agree and you are correct.  I think that they don't even have an integrated merchant account.  I haven't been able to get a transaction through as well as others on this board.   They seem to want you to have to call to complete the transaction or email.
