please stop hating beautiful women.
My missus thinks the dress is quite sexy, the only issue she had was how long I kept looking @ the imgur album.
Try stepping out of your cave and going to ANY promotional event.  
Then have fun screaming at all the booth babes for not conforming to your ideals.  
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:34:31
so you want to sponsor rape, extortion and child pornography.
Well, I have allready reported you to the authorities and hopefully any promotion you do do is quickly caught and you are imprisoned for it.
Something is terribly wrong with you buddy, you see a pretty show girl and your first thoughts are "Rape, extortion, child pornography, sexual abuse".
Seriously get help before you hurt someone.

@_date: 2014-05-11 01:46:52


And if you are, I bet any fucking money your a fat ugly neckbeard and this is the real reason your throwing an e-tantrum.
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:27:53


keep dreaming bitch :P
the only people with problems here are the haters / ugly chicks.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:03:43
actually you are very very wrong.
Busybox + Linux is a slimmed down OS used on many embedded platforms.  
Try not to correct others when you have NFI yourself mmmkay.

your reading between lines to attack someone.

Seriously though, as I commented here: 
You now have the golden opportunity to buy at bottom, just dont invest more than you care to lose and like gambling calculate profit your original stake and not your highest net value.  
Relax, play the long game and take it easy linderper out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:21:30
lol :D
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:49:34

@_date: 2013-07-18 06:54:06


you just admitted that you are lying and that the story here is not the real story.......
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:45:46
now you can buy at the bottom and be another "early adopter" :D
@_date: 2013-05-29 05:16:36
that's because your a greedy schmuck who is only into bitcoins for personal gain - I hope you lose your shirt :)
