I don't think those are the same as what is commonly known as key stretching.
Key stretching is usually thought of as repeatedly hashing an original key to get a new stronger key.

I originally misinterpreted "pairs of transactions of the same amount to the same address" as the original MtGox transaction and that transaction with a slightly modified signature. These two transactions would have different hashes but would conflict (same inputs) so only one would make it into the blockchain.
Now I realized that was referring to the transaction with the modified signature and a second transaction that MtGox would send because it lost track of the first one.

Bitpay has a minimum of 0.0001 BTC.

It's actually better to buy for fixed fiat. For example:
If you buy fixed bitcoin: Price is $1000, you buy 1 BTC for $1000. Price goes to $500. You buy 1BTC for $500. Now you have 2 BTC and spent $1500. That's $750 per coin on average.
Now consider buying with fixed fiat. You buy 1 BTC for $1000 then you buy 2 BTC for $1000. So in this case you have 3 BTC and spent $2000 for an average of $667 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:47:47
If the price gets above $1000 you still get more bitcoin for your dollars using fixed fiat than fixed BTC.
For example, with fixed bitcoin: If the price starts at $1000 you would buy 1 BTC for $1000. Then the price goes to $2000 and you buy 1 BTC for $2000. That's 2 BTC for $3000 meaning an average of $1500 per bitcoin.
Now with fixed fiat: You buy 1 BTC for for $1000 then 0.5 BTC for $1000. That's 1.5 BTC for $2000 meaning an average of $1333 per bitcoin.

Sure it is possible, by building a second bitcoin.
Bitcoin is basically a way for decentralized people to agree on a list of transactions. Look at all the work and infrastructure that are required to do that.
You want a way for the decentralized network to count some other set of transactions. You're going to have to make a second bitcoin to do this.
And it's harder than that. We don't even know during what period we are looking for transactions because the timestamps in blocks can be off by many hours. Sometimes the timestamp of one block is actually before the timestamp of the previous block. Because miners can't even agree what time it is.

If a transaction disappears then yes it goes back to the sender. But this would usually only happen if the fee was really low. And it's possible for the receiver to rebroadcast it to try to get the transaction into another block.

Probably more likely than each retailer mining, would be pools accepting payment in order to accept certain transactions. So a retailer could have a deal with a certain pool so that it can tell the pool to accept certain transactions and pay the pool for those.
In theory this could actually be done without any extra agreements. The store could just immediately spend the (unconfirmed) transaction with a transaction that has a double or triple fee. Then the pool would use enough logic to see that confirming both transactions would pay off. I don't think this logic is implemented right now, but I'm sure it will be in the future.

But in your 10 min, 10 min, 10 min, 13:20, 16 min example, the difficulty would readjust so the average is 10 minutes.
So it would turn into 8.427, 8.427, 8.427, 10.955, 13.483 min.
Once the readjustment happens, the only thing that determines profitability is what percentage of blocks the selfish miners get. If the selfish miners have 25% of the power but earn 26% of the blocks, it doesn't matter that the blocks are slow at first. After the readjustment they will still get 26% of the blocks but now blocks come on average every 10 minutes.

Basically selfish mining makes it look like the overall hashrate of the network is lower than it actually is (because a lot of the work is wasted).
After 2 weeks the difficulty will adjust to the new effective hashrate. This means everyone gets less money during the first 2 weeks, but after that the selfish miners will make more than if they weren't selfish. So it is good for them in the long run.
After the difficulty adjusts, blocks will be found every 10 minutes on average.

Why would the difficulty be lower if they are mining fairly? The only reason the difficulty lowered was because of the selfish mining.
Mining fairly: after several weeks there are an average of 10min/block
Selfish mining: after several weeks there are an average of 10min/block
Whatever way the mining is done, once it has been happening for a few weeks, the difficulty automatically compensates and makes it so a block comes every 10 minutes on average.
Since there are the same number of blocks per period of time for each method, and since selfish mining gets a larger percentage of those blocks, selfish mining is more profitable.

Hashes will be broadcast on the same network if people broadcast hashes on the same same network.
If the plan is to get everyone to switch over to the new protocol, then they would probably keep the same port and such, so yes it would be broadcast on the same network. If not eveyone switches over then you have essentially 2 different currencies on the same network. In that case to avoid wasting bandwidth and CPU time it would probably be a good idea for one of them to switch to a different port or somehow else mark the difference.
Evey computer checks the hashes. There might be some phone clients or unfinished clients that don't, but they usually all do. There are some lightweight clients that don't operate with a full chain, but they at least check relevant hashes that they do receive. Bitcoin is based on distrust, so if a client didn't check and instead just trusted the other nodes, that would be against the core principles.

It's not the same as Satoshi Dice. With Satoshi Dice you have to spam the blockchain with every bet you make. With Just Dice you deposit once then bet with your deposited money until you want to withdraw.
The main similarity is they are both provably fair for betters.
Just Dice allows people to invest in the site and make money when betters lose. It isn't provably fair for investors though.

Sure the selfish miners could get a large 2 week income boost by stopping selfish mining.
But they could also get a small, but infinitely long lasting income boost by continuing to selfish mine.
An analogy to this is say you own a bitcoin miner worth $100 that can earn you $1 a day (in this example difficulty and exchange are constant). You might say you can boost your profits by selling it, because that would allow you to earn $100 a day. But that $100/day would only last for a single day, then you earn nothing after that. If you don't sell it, and keep mining with it for a year, then you have earned $365 dollars. So it was actually more profitable to keep with the small steady income instead of taking a large income for a very short amount of time.

The miners don't accept clients. They accept transactions.

Miners should optimize which transactions they accept based on their fee and size (kB). Which client produced the transaction is not a factor.

I think when a pool gives work to miners, it doesn't give them the whole transaction, just enough of the transaction to be able to mine.

Well every non-strange and non-generation transaction has a sender address.
But yeah I guess if tlsb75 was for example using mtgox and decided to withdraw money but instead of withdrawing it to a sending address withdrew it to a receiving address, that would be a problem. The person who would bounce it back would bounce it back to mtgox, the sending address, and it wouldn't get credited to tlsb75.
But if tlsb75 was say using an android wallet and wanted to send money to his multibit wallet, if he used a sending address instead of a receiving address, if the receiver decided to bounce it back, it would bounce back to the Android wallet so he would get his money back.

At an actual exchange, users deposit USD, users deposit BTC, and users deposit yuan. Then the users trade with each other only as much as they have in their account. So if you add up all the balances that each person has, that should be how much the exchange has for that currency. So this should cause no delay in withdrawal. is worried that they might be doing fractional reserve, such as investing the deposits in stocks. This is a risk because if the stock goes down then they don't have enough money to pay all the users.
There are legitimate reasons for delay though. These include moving funds to offline wallets for safety, and also delaying payments to help prevent fraud.

Long term the generation will disappear. If the only incentive to mine is the generation, then bitcoin is doomed. If bitcoin is doomed the you should sell now before everyone else realizes it's doomed.
Bitcoin is based on distrust and greed. No node trusts any other node because the other node could easily be lying, so every node checks every hash. Greed provides an incentive to mine and thus secure the network. Every node and miner is expected to only act in their own interest. If that includes only allowing transactions with a certain fee, then that is what is expected of the miner.

That seems extremely unlikely.

Jealous of what? Fake giving people money?

You can't know for certain that your actions won't change the exchange rate.
Everyone's actions together are increasing the exchange rate, so on average, you are helping to increase the exchange rate.

Firefox isn't malicious and isn't malware.
The html file might be considered malware. If it was intentionally written to freeze firefox, then the html file is malware. If it just happens to accidentally trigger a firefox parsing bug that freezes firefox, then it wouldn't be malware, unless people are spreading it around trying to intentionally use it to freeze other people's computers.
A virus though contains the complicated feature of spreading to other computers. This would not happen accidentally like a simple freeze bug would.
You seem to think that if an html file is valid, and "can be displayed by opera, chrome and even internet explorer without any problems" then that means the html file is not malicious. That's wrong. It is possible to write a malicious html file that uses valid standards-compliant html, but checks what browser you are using and only does the malicious action if you use firefox.

So you found them and didn't withdraw the 1 BTC?
Edit: How did I get gold for this crappy comment? Thanks though!
Oh, the person who found the password gave me gold. Teamwork I guess.

 (actually higher than mtgox but due to the local nature it is not possible to trade very large amounts)

I don't know the exact structure, but say for example you have 5 things encrypted with the same password. 2 are valuable and 3 aren't. Well you can send him one of the things that isn't valuable and he can crack the password on that, then tell you the password so you can unlock the valuable things yourself.

Where are the personal details? Or have they already been removed?
