Are they trying to make BTC look unstable and therefore bumping Dash??
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:16:04
Such a lot of fudge, I have never had a problem, 99% hysteria to push the BU agenda.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:40:55
Wouldn't surprise me one bit.

Bitcoin Cash is an abortion laying on the floor. 
A Chinese Copy &amp; Paste like everything else from there!! 
At least u/coblee had the vision to start from the beginning and not try and steal a name and it's brand..
Oh and fuck Roger too!!
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:04:28
You're a perfect example. How is the price now?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:15:05
Yeah? Watch when exchanges open wallets for deposits ��

Yeah right.. the truth is out now.
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:11:24
Take a time out buddy.. chill, walk away come back in a few weeks. Don't let the nasty politics get to you.
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:37:08
That not new ��
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:06:08
There shouldn't be two subs, it divides the community 
@_date: 2017-04-27 10:50:44
Most users don't follow these politics and most traders couldn't give 2 hoots and would dump in a heartbeat. 
This is bad for all Bitcoin enthusiasts and holders and it's time to band together. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:27:34
Thieves yes. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:08:54
Bring on the Jihan Wu of developers isn't that what Roger is doing?

Litecoin needs to UASF now, this tail wagging the dog has to stop.
Edited :)
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:47:30
So he has decided to hold Litecoin Ransom ��
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:50:15
About 200GB per month.
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:54:43
If you look at his work on torrents the man is a genius.  I'm looking forward to what he does. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:52:30
If everyone turns off their nodes does it make it easier for Roger and Jihan to fork the chain into BU?
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:35:36
75% activation was all that was needed for the activation period. It was going to happen, feels like something else?? 
Perhaps he got wind of someone going to stop signalling and put activation at risk?? Hence your reasoning. 
Or more sinister P &amp; D ?
It would be nice if he states why and not leave us guessing. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:20:21
I wasn't talking about LTC ��
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:37:57
He may well do it in java
@_date: 2017-04-16 11:34:55
Don't send them to the reddit subs ffs
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:53:13
Poor Jihan 
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:25:07
How about addressing the point of the post? Why divert the post?
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:21:17
He will, he won't loose face. Well done.
@_date: 2017-04-13 12:49:26
He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, did you see his norton post yesterday ��
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:25:21
Support what your research tells you, I'm keen on seeing what SW does on the other crypto activating it, but I'm not against BTU either, both sides have very relevant arguments. I would like to see the best of both sides prevail. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:33:40
Yep. Right now in fact. Decentralisation is a fallacy. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 11:08:29
No he is offering a refund or discount on mining time lost.
I wonder if he will signal SegWit on his customers machine whilst he "Tests" them for 2 more weeks :)

All I see are red candles 
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:46:04
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:03:48
Pump &amp; Dumps are what makes this crypto market more resilient, some mining pools may have an advantage right now and future hardware will eat them up too and become more decentralised as well. 
Bitcoin in 2009 was 0.009 of a cent! That was less than 8 years ago. This play from miners is a good, needed test for bitcoin as when the market is worth Trillions, these antics will appear to be akin to kinda garden pranks compared to the plays BTC will face.
@_date: 2017-04-09 09:33:24
1 month reditor? Post on your real account..
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:32:26
Can you qualify your answer as the probability is high? I'd say he probably has hooked them up, and his customers get the next shipment. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:01:05
What was the volume on that dump?
@_date: 2017-04-09 09:23:41
Because the miners now control bitcoin and are a law unto themselves. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:04:42
I would.
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:26:03
Nice to see he knows who Satoshi is and putting a shout out for BTC.

Auction them, it legitimises BTC in their country 
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:01:06
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:03:41
Different algorithms to BTC not a problem for LTC. But if LTC implement it then it will raise SegWit profile for BTC..
@_date: 2017-04-28 07:46:57
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:04:04
Bitcoin hasn't failed at all.

Somehow the US think this decentralised crypto is attached to the rise and fall of the USD?? 
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:57:03
Perfect answer..
@_date: 2017-04-25 23:49:44
Oh here he is trolling �� nose back to the grindstone please and fix Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:16:50
Perhaps a Payment system to a pool and payment by consensus of the pool.
@_date: 2017-04-22 03:19:15
0.000452 BTC transaction fee so the difference may well be the difference in price valuation by both parties. 
Look at the amount of BTC sent and received if the difference is 0.000452 BTC then it's all good.
I think that's the way I see it.
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:12:25
There clearly needs to be a voting system implemented into the future progress of Bitcoin but who are the stakeholders?
Who do core consider stakeholders? 
Who do miners consider stakeholders?
Who do the Exchanges &amp; Wallet providers consider stakeholders?
Who do bitcoin holders consider legitimate stakeholders?
How do we implement a voting system that can not be rigged with double votes or possibility of fraud?
How do we remove these bad actors who think they have the right to sway people's thinking or feel that they own enough bitcoin to have more of an opinion that anyone else?
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:55:03
If you can't use Bitcoin everyday to do normal purchases, Bitcoin will become useless and out of date very quickly. This BS needs to be resolved quickly. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:30:11
Hmm so there is a way to deal with them.
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:12:53
Sell on an exchange like btcmarkets in Australia and such, find a market in your country. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:39:48

I wouldn't name it recovery seed in actual fact it could be for any crypto. Any amount of value should be stored in a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:11:13
Roger speaks over people and put words in their mouths.. I like his passion but he makes masked belittling comments. It's kind on annoying. If these guys were in a room for a few weeks I'm sure they could come out with a great outcome for all.
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:50:41
Ledger Nano S is what I have.
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:41:31
Spyware is an issue with anything that sits on your computer 24/7. I keep only spending money online and the rest offline. Does that answer your question?

Yeah, I'd actually like to hear from him to size him up. I think a lot of people would.

1 bitcoin 1 vote :) its simple POS
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:20:26
I was reading they are looking at creating their own coin, if they do they will ban all others. They will only push bitcoin underground and discourage competitive mining. This doesn't help us decentralising the current mining problem. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:55:44
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:42:45
Yes that's true.

Don't keep your coins in an exchange, get the Ledger Nano S or something similar. Don't trust anyone but yourself with your future.

Buying something is not taxable, making a profit is taxable when you realise the profit. You argument is that if you don't realise the profit and the base price drops after you have paid tax you have a net loss. There are other avenues available to you to wash said profits. Keep researching:)

I use a Nano S so the private key never leaves the device, I don't even know it. The recovery phrase is the only thing I know. Also you have to confirm the transaction on the actual device to make it go through.

Bitcoin party A and Bitcoin party B are in the middle of a civil war and together are fucking the whole system. In conjunction there are whales and developers and mining cartels manipulating the price via both parties and twitter wars, spamming the Blockchain and each other. In short these Fuckwits are just trashing the whole system so the whole world sees this BS and runs away to anywhere else but Bitcoin.

You could hide them in a story one word hidden in each paragraph or something like that, you could hide the placement of the words in your phone like a phone number �� named ---- Brian Troy Commons
Use a legitimate number what ever you have where you live place the words in a paragraph and put the digital record in your work somewhere x multiple places, home work cloud - but the key is the hidden number and only you know how it works, ie every second sentence, every paragraph, every chapter even, or all of the above ��
