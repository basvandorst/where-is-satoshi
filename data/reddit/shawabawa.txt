Them overpaying for fees saves them much more money in support - if a transaction gets stuck they have to deal with support tickets
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:38:58
yes (imo).
Running a full bitcoin node is incredibly cheap with 1mb, 10mb, or even 100mb blocks.
The main problem is the increase in bandwidth requirements to distribute the blocks which means larger blocks may make running nodes on residential internet connections infeasible.
Some people think this is a serious problem, but I personally don't see why we need everyone running nodes in their house in order to be decentralised

"Mathematical study"
More like: If trend carries on, bitcoin will go up - no fucking shit
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:45:37
If the block was sending the reward to your personal address none of the shares would be accepted, which means you're effectively solo mining
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:48:59
There's no incentive for miners to include 0 sat/B.
There's a tiny cost in including a transaction in a block as it makes it more likely someone will beat you to publishing the block (by a tiny, tiny amount).
This means no "rational" miner will process 0sat/B transactions - although in reality some might in order to push bitcoin adoption
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:47:49
There was devaluation, not significant inflation
Inflation means devaluation through increase of circulating supply, which does happen very slowly in bitcoin but it's on a time limit and will stop eventually
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:52:14
No, but there's no proof against it either
Which imo is just as bad
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:49:43
$2 if you're happy to wait a few days, if you're lucky.
If you want it in the next block, which anyone doing actual transactions does, it's $10+ even with segwit
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:52:33
Do you know your address? You can just look it up on a bitcoin cash explorer (blockchair is one)
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:44:41
Segwit transactions are 40% cheaper. They are the same speed other than that.
40% off $10 transactions it's still ridiculously expensive. Anything more than $0.01 for a crypto is way too high imo
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:25:21
Coinbase, bitstamp, lykke
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:32:21
Segwit is kind of like a backwards compatible blocksize increase.
It allows you to move some of the transaction data "outside" of the blocks, so that they don't count towards the size-limit, but this only works on new "segwit-enabled" addresses.
If everyone used it, effective block sizes would be around 1.6-2MB.
The problem is everyone isn't using it for various reasons (ignorance, complexity, etc)
Lightning network lets you send valid transactions directly to someone else safely - you both put in deposits (into a "channel") and if one party tries to cheat the other, they can go to the blockchain to reclaim their deposit (and the other party's deposit in some situations i think? to discourage cheating)
You can also route lightning transactions through other people's channels (for which they may want a fee - albeit likely much smaller than the blockchain fee). If enough people open lightning channels, this becomes a viable way to send money cheaply
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:54:48
I think mean fairly uncheap
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:32:00
You would remove all transactions except coinbase as they're paying the highest fees
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:02:07
To mine the block yes, but not to include zero fee transactions
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:12:43
The channel only lasts as long as the funds in the channel lasts.
Unless you're sending and receiving exactly the same amounts over a long period of time you'll have to top it up fairly often
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:41:09
For crypto, yes. Anything over a few cents is way too high
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:27:39


As COSS exchange holds the private keys they would have to help you get it back, the only option is to contact support
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:59:14
No, BCH didn't change the address scheme so any BTC address is a valid BCH address (at least at the time of the fork that was true, newer segwit addresses aren't BCH compatible)
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:53:02
No there isn't
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:40:41


@_date: 2019-07-18 14:50:50
more like $800 but yes. Got a coinbase price alert "bitcoin up 7.92% in the last 23 minutes"
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:29:16
your BCH will be in whatever address your BTC were on at the time of the split (sounds like should be in the wallet you created on your computer)
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:30:44
no. The rate of blocks is fixed at 1 per 10 minutes on average (it auto adjusts)
The max size of the blocks is also fixed at 1mb.
The blocks are full so you have to bid more to be included in a block. Some people wanted to increase the blocksize to allow more transactions, which led to the bitcoin cash fork when people couldn't agree
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:21:36
It's not fud. It's that their support costs exceed the value they get from supporting it
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:38:57
\ is correct.
The nodes all support and understand segwit transactions, which means even "non-segwit" clients support the transactions, they simply can't generate them
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:54:11
4 years ago I bought a round of drinks with bitcoin at a pub in London.
It took around 10 seconds (accepted the unconfirmed transaction), and cost a few cents in transaction fees.
That pub no longer accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:45


In that case imo we will never see lightning network get widespread adoption. 
I guess something like BitPay could get decent adoption with people trusting them with their funds, but it's not a real p2p currency when used like that
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:48:32
I'm concerned about fees
However, I'm not the author of any wallet or exchange software so I can't implement segwit.
I could move my bitcoins to a segwit address but I don't want to. I haven't moved my coins for months anyway, doesn't seem worth it to save ~40% on my *next* fee
What I can do is use alts that actually work. (I really don't see the point in bitcoin cash - the big draw of bitcoin is that it's the first/longest/most worked)
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:27:23
No, he's saying random people who run nodes on raspberry pi's wouldn't be able to deal with bigger blocks.
Apparently these people are the key to bitcoin being decentralised.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:51:06
yes. Has been for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:34:07
No it didn't. It moved parts of specific types of transactions from the block ("segregated" them), and counted their size differently. But as we've seen, it wasn't as effective as just doubling the block size limit in terms of adoption.
tl;dr: Segwit must be adopted, 2x would've been instant
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:26:37
I know. By 40%
It needs to be more like 99.9% for me to be excited about bitcoin again
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:25
No way anyone can hope to withdraw in time for christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:28:49


Which is another way of saying the vast majority of people have to give up their privates keys to use LN, as the vast majority of people will be unable to run a node (especially with proper reliability for a payment channel)
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:26:15
I don't think there ever were 32mb blocks. The block cap was shrunk *in case* of spam attack, as it was very early days
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:19:59
It depends on the transaction and the urgency. People are definitely paying $50 for transactions right now, just maybe not for single inputs
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:35
Support costs dealing with customers that don't understand satoshis per bytes and why their transaction is stuck and what a confirmation is and why their payment hasn't gone through

How recently is recently? Within 10 years or 1 year for example?
edit: Also, is it in the oxford english dictionary or the oxford dictionaries online? I think they're different
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:10:35
You are basically understanding correctly.
I guess people use "wallet" wrong because people like analogies. It's easier to think of your bitcoin wallet as a single place where your money is, like your physical wallet. It's weird to think of your wallet as a collection of 5 different addresses which each have different balances
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:15:15


If he takes the coins and reveals the password then as long as the password matched his description he wasn't really a fraud. People had a fair chance of getting the coins before him
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:48:15


Uh.. quite a lot. You'll have 60% more coins if you invest at $500 instead of $800
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:18:36
Re-read the sentence, that's not what was said.
It means he has at least 800k bitcoins but probably more like 1 million
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:37:15
current price: $570.00
8*570 = $4560
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:35:06
No way. He might have given 0.16 if you tried with something small, but there's absolutely no way he would give away ~$600 hoping for a bigger score
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:57:32
Can everyone who posts thing I don't like please post to Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:33:15
Then either he wont reveal the passphrase and we'll know he's a fraud, or he will and we'll know he isn't.

@_date: 2014-03-13 15:06:06


Usually 4 short random words are actually stronger than 3 long ones.
something like: "coincidence theoretical mumbojumbo" isn't as secure as it might seem
"four jump truck singer" is probably stronger (also not super secure though)
word length means nothing in a dictionary attack - only number of words and to a smaller extent frequency of words
What was the made up word? If it's something that you made up and are confident nobody has ever used before (like "bunjerigly") it shouldn't have been cracked. Something like "silmarillion" though is probably in attacker's dictionaries

I have a 0.1BTC withdrawal go through within a few minutes, still waiting after half an hour for a 1BTC withdrawal.
Makes sense that they would enable for small withdrawals first
edit: 1BTC now processed!
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:06:27
base64 gives you 64 combinations per byte = 2^6
So each byte gives you the same information as 6 bits instead of 8, therefore base64 file sizes are 8/6 = 133% of the size

I don't really believe in bitcoin anymore.

@_date: 2019-06-27 15:25:16
I just double checked
Price crash ~9.30-9.45pm BST (UTC+1) [1]
From the very link you sent, "Coinbase is having issues since 4:44 PM EDT" = 9.44pm BST [2]
Half way between 15:00 and 18:00 (21:00 and 23:00 in my time zone) is after the crash started
seems you got an hour out at some point: 16:30 is 4:30 not 3:30
  [1] 
  [2] 
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:08:32
LN wouldn't help them. Every payment they receive is to a unique address, so there's no savings for setting up a channel.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:36:23
Cause and effect backwards. The crash happened just before coinbase went down
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:45:55
The price crash started at 4.30, coinbase errors started at 4.44

The code is open source, but unless you verify that the code you receive from the website it correct every single time you connect, that doesn't matter.
The web server can be programmed to have a 0.0001% chance of delivering malicious code - it would be very unlikely for anyone to check the one time it served the bad code instead of the good
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:27:03
You can (and should) generate the transactions on the offline computer and transfer just the signed transaction to the online computer
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:06:21
"Likely" was a poor choice of word by me, I should have said "it's possible"
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:06:12
He created his private key online.
Likely the owner of bitaddress.org was keeping all the private keys generated by the site, and when they saw the chance to steal 387 bitcoins they went for it.
I would have thought not generating your private key online would be pretty obvious, but I guess not :/
edit: bitaddress does generate the keys offline, but there's loads of ways it could be compromised, e.g.
  1. The site sometimes returns different code that sends the private key back (if people tested it they'd be unlikely to get the dangerous code)
  2. A browser extension you've installed could read the key
  3. It doesn't require https, so if you access it via http you could get silently redirected to a malicious version
  4. You could get phished
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:29:27
Even if bitaddress is 100% trustworthy, numbers 2, 3 and 4 could still compromise keys generated by it with no malicious action by the site
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:07:43
Paper wallets should be generated on a non-internet connected machine, in which case they are totally safe - of course most people wont do that, or if they do they wont keep the machine offline forever
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:15:32
If you run the site from source you're safe. If you run it from the website, there's no guarantee you're served the same code (even if you trust the owner, they could get hacked and have the source changed)

The whole promise of cryptocurrency is to remove the bureaucracy and control of banks and to take control of your own money.
But suddenly when I want to send my friend money, I'm supposed to wait until i need to pay 3 people, and wait until the end of the week, just so I can pay a reasonable fee?
I'll just go back to banks in that case.

You're saving 15-20% because you're indirectly using stolen credit cards
(People buy amazon gift cards with stolen/hacked cards, then sell them through purse.io at huge discounts)
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:29:34
To be fair, it's actually basically correct.
Replace "certain patterns" with "certain number of leading 0's" (I know that's still not correct, but it's simpler than "less than a certain number when interpreted as a big endian integer") and "tricking..." with "which allows a single unfunded transaction to your account"
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:50:50
I'm using bitstamp.net
No particular reason, just from a bit of googling seemed like it has been around for a while, hasn't ripped people off and hasn't had as bad server problems as gox.
transferwise lets you pay with debit card, no need for any wire transfers on your end, but they do a wire transfer to them so you still have to wait 2-3 business days.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:01:17
imo he explained it wrong.
All money is in a way declared as being money. The difference between bitcoin and traditional fiat is that with bitcoin is decentralised. In bitcoin new money is introduced only if the majority agrees (through mining). With fiat, the government can just print more money and every else gets screwed by inflation

For most purposes, 1 confirmation in bitcoin is overkill. Litecoin's faster confirmations mean you can get better confirmation than just "90% of clients have seen the transaction" without having to wait ~10mins
