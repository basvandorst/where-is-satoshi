threads on the topic which most have started filling with sentiments of fraud:

Sorry should have added that info.
6 email contact attempts (site gives no other methods), contact form attempts, and also reached out to the web registrar's protected admin contact 2 times as well. 
Plus blockchain reveals tumbler like moving of the coins after payment and missed shipping deadline by 2 weeks.

I allege fraud because it's now 2 months past ship date with no response to repeated emails. The domain dogevertise.com just recently went dark (today) as I've started probing and requesting more help.
here's the info I've gained so far. (yes I realize I'm an idiot for sending them anything, I'm just requesting some help.)

I've sent 2 inquires and 2 refund requests. It's just below what the FTC will consider looking into and law enforcement wont do anything as it's under $500.
