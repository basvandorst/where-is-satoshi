This is a good time to help you learn some economics! There are a few reasons why this wouldn't ever happen:
1. The amount of money needed to purchase a "majority" of a cryptocurrency would be *astronomical*. If an entity tried to buy the majority of Bitcoin, its market price would rise due to scarcity. I don't know if any government or bank has enough liquid assets to attempt this (without printing more currency for this sole purpose, which would be a very idiotic decision). The upside of this would be that anyone hodling at the time would become extremely wealthy.
2. They wouldn't ever send the Bitcoin to an address that didn't exist. Because it would be *billions* of dollars – if not *trillions*, by the time they were done purchasing – worth of assets. If you had a trillion dollars sitting in your basement, would you burn it just to make a point? Instead of taking the loss, they'd want to spend it on salaries, bonuses, programs, infrastructure, etc. (Another way to put this is: *the people who don't like cryptocurrencies feel that way because they're not the ones holding them.* People want to be in positions of power/control, and once an entity holds Bitcoin, it no longer has to fight against it, because it has won.)
3. Cryptocurrencies can be created and forked. A hostile takeover of all cryptocurrencies would be like trying to fight the ocean with a broom.
I think that we'll see more governments and banks embrace cryptocurrencies in the coming years. Banks will begin to offer services that compliment cryptocurrencies rather than fight against them (i.e. developing nice POS software, hardware wallets, offering crypto-related financial planning services, B2B consulting, and helping small mom-and-pop businesses make the transition to Bitcoin, just to name some off the top of my head). Loans and credit cards will always need to be a thing because the general public demands it. The stock markets will still exist. And governments will adapt over time.

This was the nicest comment to wake up to. Thanks so much!

People are subconsciously biased towards avoiding losses rather than acquiring gains. (Called "loss aversion".)
I'm guessing that a lot of the newcomers here are young, inexperienced, and they don't have very much money (maybe savings from part-time minimum wage jobs). $100 is a lot when you have to work for a week to earn it. I've been there.
All of that being said, fortune favors the hodl.

I *totally* agree. IMO Andreas is one of the most well-spoken individuals in the community and has really done a lot for us.

Did some research. I don't think there's a video.
Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat, Massachusetts) quotes Jamie Dimon (JP Morgan CEO) saying this in her book, [A Fighting Chance](

Nope, it doesn't do that. :) All the code is on GitHub, and I also have a [section on security]( in the readme.

Holy shit, this is the future.

The Doge clan is wonderful!

Thanks a lot! I've been loving minimalist UI design for the past few years and I think this one turned out pretty good.

Thank you! Right now, it can only display the Bitcoin price, but I'd like to add support for other coins in the future.
What other coins would you like to see added?

**We need both engineers and salesmen.**
They don't have to be slimy salesmen. They can be individuals who serve to teach and inform, like Andreas Antonopoulos.

I'd like to caution others against using strong language like criminals, Jesus, Judas, and ex-convict in a cold pitch. Like said, it can make you sound fanatic.
Here's a separate pitch you can use (I took most of it directly from Andreas' website and combined it with your second question):

Thanks so much!
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:20:14
I'm going to add that, yes!

I noticed the B in the logo right away. It's super slick and versatile (I especially love [this mockup](
Thanks for doing this.

YES. This is *such* a good post. you have a brilliant and clear writing style. Is there somewhere I could read more of your work?

I've been such a hardcore Chrome user that I didn't even know Firefox supported extensions! I can certainly take a look into this. :)

Probably rented/borrowed it for the purposes of this video.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:12:13
Ah, I can't believe I didn't think of that! Adding that to my list, too.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:15:15
Thank you! That's a great idea. I'll add it to my list.

Comments like that make me think that he doesn't understand the benefits of blockchain. He's thinking about it with the same mindset as those who compare cryptocurrencies to tulips.
Stiglitz is an accomplished man, but he doesn't understand this area. It'd be like asking Elon Musk to summarize events in the medical industry.
Andreas Antonopoulos did an [awesome job]( on educating the Canadian Senate. I'd love to sit people like Stiglitz in front of Andreas for a few hours and then find out what they think.
