Yeah wait to see the world acceptance &amp; regulation take off, and see your country fall behind the 8 ball.  Hint:  Recognize it, throw some minimal rules on it for now and look like a progressive nation.

I think it will be interesting to see the reactions of countries who are fundamentally afraid of btc as the rest of the modern world embraces it.  They will reverse their stance.  If they had half a brain the would realize that this is an empowering vehicle on a sovereign level.

Cold storage FTW can't believe how many coins I had on the windows BTC client for so long before waking up to cold storage.  Imagine how many unencrypted wallet.dat files stored online were imported through a simple google search and spent.

This.  They are mining with pre-orders.  If no one pre-orders, then manufacturers would have to change their business model.  Come march you better be hashing with Th/s equipment.  Everything else will just be room heaters.

mmkay Registered voter lists did not make my "cool things to buy" with BTC list. :P

Sounds like they are doing their due diligence on BTC.  The multi-year wall street pump and dump cometh?

Adoption phase commencing...

I think this is a big deal.  It's fun watching the adoption phase.

Seems like Northern (colder) states are more into BTC.  Maybe they like the dual benefit of mining hardware that also heat the house :)

I could see this growing with the local bitcoin crowd.

Only if you are running BTC-E
