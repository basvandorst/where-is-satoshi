China /USA Trade war fears will see money going into Gold and Bitcoin- get set for a spike
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:24:24
Cashed out the little BTC I hold into fiat at 7850 - will re enter at 6000 and hopefully have 10- 20 per cent more BTC - that's the plan anyway - but with my timing it will probably rally now!

One thing is sure - when the whales have  accumulated their fill BTC is gong to bounce hard
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:33:25
If it doesn't go down its going to go up!

USA waking up - which way will they take us?

The pull back so far has been low volume - which is bullish sign

Looking at 12 hour chart I think BTC is getting ready for another attempt to take out 6700 level.
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:19:25
I think chart is looking very healthy - good volume and with more good news BTC could really fly.  So many "nervous nellies" on this thread - Just relax people and enjoy the show!

Looks like a normal pull back for profit taking to me people- if BTC has move this much because black rock "may be thinking about considering" a ETF - imagine the move it will make when some hedge fund actually opens a BTC EFT

Dreadful stereotype _North East asian peope  can be big -When I was at square china last year I there were some seriously big chinese soldiers on guard!

Selling at 6700 could be a good a strategy - lock in profit if you are a trader- rinse and repeat!

Interesting point you make - when analyzing sideways price movement the big question is "is it accumulation (ie market makers buying low to sell high) or distribution ?"(market makers selling high to take profit).  So it could go down from here - but I don't think so - it just feels more like accumulation to me - there seems more positivity in market at the moment.  But like everyone else I don't have a crystal ball!

BTC price looking strong!
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:27:46
This sideways movement around high 7000 low 8000 is a classic example of what traders call consolidation in which market movers accumulate more coin before it spikes higher.  It is a BULLISH sign!
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:19:35
The whole point of accumulation is to buy shares at a low price without drawing the attention of the market, and then once you have a big position, then let the market go up - or that's the theory anyway!

With day trading the big thing is the trend of the market - in a bear market , unless you are shorting, no trades will win.  However , in a strong up ward bull market, it is actually hard to lose, once you get the hang of it.  The basic technique I use in an upward trend is to buy the pull back, ie. buy the dip.  This works because even in a bull market  it doesn't go straight up - it will always pull back before the next spike.  So if it is a sustained bull market, like we might be entering now, it is pretty hard to lose.  On the other hand in a bear market like we have come out of it is hard to win.  That's why traders say - 'the trend is your friend"
