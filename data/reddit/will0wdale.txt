Cavirtex are a bunch of scammer,s. 
Cavirtex got hacked in April of 2014 and someone had got everybody's email passwords etc... and they said it was not there fault when funds (1500$) in bitcoin was withdrawn from my dad's virtex account buy someone other than him  .
AND IT'S GONE
then tried to directly withdraw 7000$ from his savings.
meanwhile some one was roaming free in his virtex account while my dad was locked out.
Still nothing back.

some better than others :)  BitLotto was the best one ever and then they failed miserably, a story worth reading into.  
@_date: 2012-11-29 01:41:39
i love it.  but miners will always receive the transaction fees when the block reward hits zero, so technically there is still bitcoin made on every block mined, even if the reward is zero.  so will the reward hit "zero" if we are still paid to mine to block?
@_date: 2012-11-18 17:18:28
I think that dude was wasted lmfao.
@_date: 2012-09-30 18:59:09
I gave them my info, many other do as well.  it's the easiest way to purchase bitcoins for canadians!  I've deposited like 10 times and withdrawn a couple times, no problems!  They are great!
The ID is only because the potential fraud when dealing with reversible payments.  Bank transfers seem solid, but a fraudster might be able to use fake info and the transfers get rolled back.  To combat this, they make everyone confirm their account.

if you live in the UK, and you're willing to knock on doors, ask around if there is a bounty for Nefario of GLBSE.  that's a way to earn a few BTC for sure.

Yes, but Litecoin still has purpose.  
There was a time where it was created so people can mine it on their CPUs while Bitcoin on their GPUs, but the timing works out pretty good where GPUs are going to be sitting idle, so..  it's not like it's a redundant chain now that we can mine it with our GPUs, it's actually the saving grace for a hope of profitably mining with Radeons for the next little while and it will make the future of cryptocurrencies a little bit more interesting.  This is assuming it really starts to take off, but I think it's likely.
@_date: 2012-11-18 17:14:39
Everyone is just going to have to point their GPUs towards litecoin :D

I think the last minute mad rush for advertising is the opposite that this company needs.  They have ads all over bitcointalk, they are buying peoples' signatures up, they had ads on [Facebook]( most likely Google then, and probably other places.  Why would they be so concerned with flooding the market with ads, when they could post just ONE picture of a ready-made or prototype ASIC and they would get 100x the amount of sales in one day?  It's not like they have direct competition up against them, there are a few ASIC projects which seem more legit than BFL at this point, but they don't have anything slated for October 2012 (10 days from now).  
BFL, are you listening?

I wasn't voting.
Why did 'throwaway-o' say "I plan to behave in exactly the same way as you do." when he could have just clicked the up arrow?  
I gave a +1 because I also plan to behave in exactly the same way as he does.  It was like a "me-too" or even a "ditto" but not a vote.

@_date: 2013-02-08 17:59:29
I'm afraid not... ~~but I see they are here in the comments (lightboxtechnologies).~~ edit: whoops mistaken!
I love these guys, I do all my trading exclusively through them and always will.  I just saw $13.74 a fee on the 20 BTC order.  I put $22.90 as my price.  20 x 22.90 = 458.  458 * 0.03 = $13.74.  The orders were executed at like $22.64. Fee should have been $13.58.  So there should have been like 16 cents returned to me.  
In my transaction history there are no positives except when I deposit CAD, everything else is minuses.  
Perhaps the 16 cents is actually being returned to me, but is not logged in transaction history?  Because it shows I paid $13.74.  
@_date: 2013-02-09 05:18:51
they're going to fix it! yay!

thanks for submitting this to reddit after CLEARLY READING IT ON REDDIT. 
@_date: 2013-02-08 15:46:09
but in my interface it shows that I paid the fee based on an amount, basically whatever I enter in the box, that's charged to my account I can see it in the transaction logs.. you're telling me there is some left in escrow?  My escrows are at 0.00/0.00... and so are my balances because I naturally withdraw after my trades.  So my account balances are reduced, the fee amounts are wrong, and there's no transaction of "fee difference being returned to me". 
I was charged a fee based on what I enter, no difference was returned to me.  I'll draw you out proof in a bit.
@_date: 2013-02-09 03:37:39
omg i was mistaken!  i thought you were virtex.. i've dealt with you guys many times and when you replied and got bumped to the top my brain just assumed you were them.  sorry about that!!!
and yea, i think i've confirmed it 100% that this is going on, but now that i know you arn't them, i'll shoot them an email!
@_date: 2013-02-09 01:46:19
~~okay so any update on this?  radio went silent.~~  derp.  i was waiting for the wrong person to reply.  i emailed them and anxiously await a response.
@_date: 2013-02-08 18:33:48
There's nothing in my transaction history that would indicate the difference of the fee being returned to me.  If the fee difference is silently being returned to me, I apologise.  
@_date: 2013-02-08 19:08:16
the only reason I'm frustrated is because I ALWAYS put a high per-BTC price.  every time so it doesn't matter what orders get executed.  so for like over a year, I think I've been paying a few cents here or there too much.  probably everyone else too.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:43:03
What if a bitcoin was worth $13,000?  That would be a $1 tip.
