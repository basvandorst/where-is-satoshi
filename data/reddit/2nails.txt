And you don't speak sarcasm either, apparently.

Considering how fast we are depleting some of the Earth most valuable ressources with our 'infinite growth' plan (fish, amazonian rainforest, oil, etc.) I feel like a shrinking economy would surely be bad short term, hopefully we can adapt eventually to the new paradigm, but ideniably would have some positive effects long term. Like, making that whole story of humanity a little bit more sustainable.

Like our own gouvernement had our best interest in mind with our previous national currencies.
Nah same shit really.

1. That point is just a fact. The ledger is public.
2. Is taxation extorsion ? That is up to debate. I'd say it isn't.

If you say it's Toric, it really is Toric.

Come on this is BTC. We've seen worse.

And if you bought any other time, you're likely to be in the green.

That guy did not convince you.
Maybe that will ?

Right. Median vs mean.

I've had the exact same objective as you do. I bought bit by bit with what I could afford to put in every month.
You'll get there eventually.

I am not sure we read the same post.
You seem to extrapolate far beyond anything he said.
The strawman is a bit too obvious.
Piketty is a great read btw.

Well one explanation would be that he doesn't use them very often, though I'm not saying that it is The reason.

Hey, nobody knows.

HMMMM NO NO NO !

Only a small number of them do it.
It has the potential to be done by more and more of them eventually though, as these shops are looking for alternative activities. There's less and less people buying presse / cigarettes.

Logarithmic makes sense if you want to see anything about the earlier mouvements, otherwise it's just a flat line.

It's an option, they don't have to sell it and IIRC only a couple of dozens do it on all of France, most of them in Paris (still they reprensent only a small percentage of all tabacs there).
The incentive though is that these shops are looking for alternatives to their historical activity. There's less and less people buying presse or cigarettes.

According to these very charts that are being shown here, price increase should slow down while approching 100k. 
Its still very volatile so it could break it very fast during another bubble but on average we should'nt reach 1 million any time soon.
It should still edge against inflation though
@_date: 2019-12-04 06:41:51
You're arguing in very bad faith. Taxes do pay for all of that, it's anything but lacking in substance.
No point discussing with you on the matter I see.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:13:39
Neither. My average buying price is actually pretty close to today's value. I started to buy after 2017 crash, bought some at 3k, some at 11k, most of it between these two.

Yay I love a country with no teachers, public hospitals, police force, roads, firefighters, public investments, shitty roads and dirty streets.

If he already owns one Bitcoin as his post implies, that pushes him to the 6.15 threshold.
