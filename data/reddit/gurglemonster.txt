Probably. The money's got to come from somewhere. Three likely options; either they find a generous benefactor to make up the shortfall, increase the losses for those who's funds weren't covered by Synapse Pay, or just lie and say the money's there and just hope not everyone attempts to withdraw their funds. 
Of course, they could have factored in the Synapse Pay funds, but [previous statements]( from said that everyone would suffer a 36% hair-cut, not just those who's funds weren't solely denominated in USD and covered by Synapse Pay. So...

The Bloomberg article is in line with all their other statements up to this point which amount to "we are evaluating all possible options, but haven't made a decision".

What it seems to be saying is that Circle have GBP Barclays accounts which will hold customers GBP denominated funds, while their US accounts hold any US denominated funds. Barclays will likely remit funds on behalf of Circle to any UK customer's accounts as their US bank does for USD at the moment. 
I see no indication that this means Circle have a UK bank account into which UK citizens can deposit funds to acquire Bitcoin, which is the blocking issue for all UK focused crypto businesses looking to provide on-ramp services.
Basically, it seems the only upshot is that it will be faster for UK customers to get cleared funds into their account than waiting for a 24/48 hour SEPA transfer from the European banks most Bitcoin businesses European operations back-end off of.

Within the European Union it's called *Passporting*. The idea is that each member state (country) implements a common set of requirements (the Payment Services Directive) to register financial entities. Subsequently, any business obtaining a financial permit (such as a license to operate as an e-money institution) can then use that license to offer services in any other member state without needing to repeat the registration process. 
It's similar to a US federal model in scope, except licenses are issued at a member state-level and provide standardization across the EU on everything from minimum capital requirements to anti-money laundering controls.

If you send to an third party wallet (exchange, gambling site etc)  
and that third party wallet fulfills your outbound transaction from an unconnected Bitcoin address, yes - it should relatively easy to break the chain. To make things even harder; 
* you could hop between multiple third party wallets (E.g. route funds to BTC-E-&gt;Ok Coin-&gt;Bitfinex-&gt;Final Destination - places that have high traffic and little or no oversight); and
* Most exchanges/third part wallets allow you to "generate a new Bitcoin Address" for receiving Bitcoins, so generating a fresh address each time further obfuscates the trail; and
* Vary the amounts. E.g. withdraw 1 BTC from Circle, but stagger the amounts to the final intended destination - E.g. 0.7 BTC followed by 0.3 BTC. 
Despite assertions to the contrary, it's not particularly hard to make tracking Bitcoin difficult (launder your *money*), provided the amounts are not huge and that enough entropy is introduced into the transaction chains.

Safello applied for some [tech accelerator run by Barclays]( and was accepted.
Barclays do not appear to have offered a bank account which Safello can use to provision exchange services at their discretion, rather Barclays have offered to allow them to build a platform to assess the [*safe use*]( of Bitcoin. 
This platform will inevitably end up with no real-world use leading Barclays to conclude that Bitcoin only has one viable real-world market - the darknet - and the whole venture will die quietly.

So what *are* BitPay doing? Because the numbers for legal commercial transactions through your platform don't look that good. 
According to [this infographic]( BitPay processed ~159 Million USD in 2014. If we generously assume each transaction generated 1% in fees, that would equate to 1.59 million USD in gross revenue. For the entire year. 
One might assume that [Mr Bransons VC money and goodwill]( are fast running out and a profitable plan of action needs to start being implemented.

**Blockchain not Bitcoin** - the two are not synonymous. The Blockchain technology is what financial institutions are interested in, Bitcoin is just the first demonstrable production implementation. 
While I cannot know your specific arrangement with Barclays, with the lack of legitimate commercial legal penetration of Bitcoin it is not a stretch to assume they will not allow you unimpeded access to the UK banking network - a holy grail for more than just your business. 
Of course, you might prove me wrong but I'm certainly not betting on it.

They do, but it's horribly slow, expensive and fragmented. The US interbank communication system is (some say deliberately) languishing back in the 70's as far as features, technology and client experience goes.

Remember that SEPA etc sit atop legacy banking infrastructure. This infrastructure does not typically 'send' or 'receive' payments outside of business days and business hours. This harks back to the days everything was loaded in manually by batch files (it still is in-fact in most financial institutions).
I don't have enough detail on the inner workings of SEPA to give you a definitive answer, but it is unlikely that SEPA clearing house imposes any limitations, rather - by mutual agreement - banks participating in the network do not process payments sent or received outside of business hours.
The banking sector is best described by the "square peg, round hole" analogy. Remember; each bank had its own internal systems, then - within a country - some of those banks started to participate with each other under common remittance and settlement platforms (E.g. UK CHAPS system), then you've got pan-European initiatives like SEPA and global initiatives like SWIFT. Each has to be integrated into the banks existing systems and every bank in every geographic region is has different requirements (you call it 'sort code' we call it 'identity number'). You can imagine the logistical nightmare - it's a wonder it works at all.

If you're the same Rassah from bitcointalk, then you'll have been around Bitcoin for a while. 
By now, it should have clicked that Bitcoin isn't going anywhere with the mainstream. It's been nearly 6 years and the technology is slow and stagnant, the upgrade paths non-viable and political turmoil and disagreement runs rife amongst its core development team. 
Apart from the *many* usability and volatility issues that simply cannot be glossed over or addressed with more third party services, you've now got the weight of history behind you. 
Bitcoin is no longer the new darling full of promise and potential, it's flaws and limitations have been laid bare for all to see.
If you step away from this nest of zealots and look objectively at Bitcoin, it should be immediately apparent why those who have not embraced it are now not going to do so and therefore why you are now left with an ever contracting pool of participants until all that's left is those who launched Bitcoin in the first place; the darknets.
Bitcoin will never achieve mainstream acceptance, but a successor crypto-currency very well might.

Something doesn't add up here. There are a lot of vagaries in your post;


which could cover anything from SEO to Malware construction. 
Also, you mention your "members" and the fact you had to start "Cash Deposit" trades on LocalBitcoins:


Firstly; what members? secondly; why did you need to create a "Cash Deposit" advertorial on LocalBitcoins if you were receiving Bitcoins? Why didn't you use a direct bank-to-bank electronic transfer (which are instant in the UK)?
Based on what you've said, your bank balance must show many deposits in either anonymous cash or irregular electronic wire transfers from the proceeds of sales of your Bitcoin. It's also not clear what volume of business you were transacting (40K GBP of profits or 40K GBP of turnover?) and if you were clearing funds into a personal account or a business account. 
The most likely reason you've been flagged is that:
  A) you're not telling the whole story and have been implicated in criminal activity which you have been wittingly or unwittingly a-party to; and/or 
  
  B) the financial transactions on your bank account are sufficiently anomalous that your bank has raised a SOCA report that has led to your 6am wake-up call. 
Subjectively, what you've stated in your post reads like text-book money laundering (See MLR Regulations 2007 on legislation.gov.uk). Either way, you should consult a Solicitor.

Bitstamp has no financial licenses, is registered as a UK Ltd shell company (Bitstamp Ltd) and just pays lip-service to AML compliance. 
If it were a true Money Service Business (which is what it registered with its bank - Unicredit - as) it would require an MSB license inside Slovenia. They continually quote UK law - yet they have *no* HMRC license and *no* FCA license for their shell Limited company. Although Bitcoin is not regulated by the FCA or HMRC, accepting and holding fiat denominated funds most certainly is (See: Payment Services Regulations 2009/2012)

You are right (again), but Bitcoin when used for legally dubious activities cannot generally be liquidated back to fiat immediately in the same way as, for example; Expedia, Overstock, NewEgg etc do through Coinbase/Bitpay etc. 
This essentially means that those acquiring Bitcoin are exposing themselves to the volatility of the market and - as a consequence - gaining or losing vs their fiat counterparts. When losses occur (E.g. market tanks), that 'value' has to go somewhere (usually speculators back pocket - as fiat). 
These losses or gains are generally minute when considered on an individual level, since dubiously legal goods (narcotics in particular) are generally pegged against a stable currency such as the US dollar. However, when added up you start to see substantial amounts of value extracted or inserted into the network. 
Also, the fact that the darknets offer commodities that are not readily available ensures a steady stream of new fiat funds into the Bitcoin network. Those individuals who would otherwise have no interest in Bitcoin (and who in the general populace would, with it's many defects and where incumbent technologies offer a significantly better customer experience?) are buying or selling Bitcoins but purely to obtain goods or services uniquely denominated in Bitcoin with little interest in the underlying value proposition. 
I would wager that Bitcoin continues to survive because of the darknet, not in-spite of it.

With regards to financial privacy, I don't disagree - the problem is that the worlds incumbent financial system does. It's for this reason that financial regulators are able to make sweeping statements about the fact that crypto-currencies are predominately used by those looking to participate in illegal activities. Just look at the cointrader.net (Canadaian) announcement today...

One follow up question; as a large business, is the volatility of Bitcoin and the limited avenues for liquidation a concern for your customers? 
If you're settling a 10K invoice, generally I'd imagine your customers want the full 10K (not 9.9 and not 10.2). They also need to be able to exchange those BTC for USD/EUR/GBP (or whatever) to pay others in their supply chain and that imposes additional charges that they (the customer) has to bear.

So, in your utopian vision how do you reconcile the fact that Bitcoin has pretty much failed at every one of its selling points?
-&gt; Micro-transactions are unfeasible due to lack of reliability (transactions not always 'seen' by all nodes on the network so you need to wait for a confirmation ~10mins, maybe 90mins) and the cost.
-&gt; Transactions fees are high relative to low value goods - also, you - the customer - are now paying them. Sure, they've been decreased in 0.9.0+ but if you try to use a reduced fee the chances of timely inclusion in a block are significantly reduced, especially if your spending from fresh inputs which have a low priority. 
-&gt; Remittance as a mechanism for foreign exchange is unfeasible because a) there aren't enough places to cash out and b) if you want to cash out in any volume, you'll affect the price (negatively) which means the recipient will either need to bleed the funds out, or take a loss. 
-&gt; Competence and security are now mandatory on the part of users. You can't store your BTC on an exchange because they might run off/lose it, you have to be careful to ensure your own storage platform hasn't been compromised. It's akin to stuffing dollars under your mattress in a bad neighborhood and hoping you don't get robbed. 
-&gt; Finally, lots of statements here about *I'm not worried I bought in at XXX or YYY* (and am sitting on a significant paper loss at this point). That's fine, if you are purely speculating with Bitcoin and can afford to wait it out until you can either recover/profit from your initial investment. But what if you want to use it as these oft vaunted *unbanked masses* supposedly do - as a currency. Say I bought a Bitcoin today, and it's dropped 3% overnight. Come the morning, I need to buy grocery's - do I wait and go hungry until Bitcoin appreciates? Or do I suck up the loss and pay it out  to buy food knowing I'm actually getting 3% less today than I did yesterday. There is a reason Zimbabweans and Argentinians use the USD and not their own currency and its called stability.  
These are all still problems 4+ years down the line. They haven't been adequately addressed. Bitcoin is nothing but gambling at this stage and like it or not, the pool of fools with *fiat* money they're willing to part with will start decreasing if you don't start seeing your *to the moon* recovery.

The bigger question is; how do Circle actually make any money? ACH isn't free, credit/debit card networks aren't free. If they're selling @ spot (or just above) - they'll likely be incurring a loss. 
Coinbase at least make their fees upfront which gives you some indication that they're probably breaking even or profiting slightly on a majority of their transactions.

I wouldn't of thought it would be a problem. Only bittylicious requires your identity, but they act as a market-place for sellers and buyers. In essence, they don't  - I believe - provide the AML documentation you provide to the seller, so when you start a trade you actually do it with an individual with the bittylicious platform acting as escrow. 
If you're sourcing funds from an alternative account, it never usually causes any problems - just make sure that whatever reference is required is included in the deposit and that it's the agreed amount (E.g. take into account banks whipping off extra fees etc).

I'm surprised more people with fiat on Gox haven't bought the cheap Bitcoins. Gox fiat wire transfers take months even when they work - so even if you've cashed everything in for your fiat - it'll take a long time to come back to you. This assumes Gox isn't insolvent. 
If Gox is insolvent, you're not likely to get any fraction of your cash back for years (See Bitcoinica fiasco which is still - legally - ongoing with creditors) - if at all. So, frankly, you might as well dump it all into cheap BTC. If operations resume you'll double your money - if Gox goes under, it's all over anyway. Seems like a no-brainer to me...

What I find staggering is that BitPay *still* don't offer the option of putting a refund Bitcoin Address in the order window. 
From a customer experience point of view, they should require either an email address (to notify you if you payment didn't arrive in time and therefore needs to be refunded) **and/or** a Bitcoin Address that can receive the payment made if, again, it didn't arrive in time.
Assuming everything is going to hit within 15 minutes and having no proper facilities for dealing with it when it doesn't is just rubbish.

Bitcoin is no where near ubiquitous enough to be used by the mainstream, therefore you would expect the volume on fiat&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin exchanges to be fairly representative of the actual market penetration into the mainstream.
The fact that the gold rush has ended, yet more mainstream companies are accepting Bitcoin means you're left with a fairly realistic picture of who's actually using it as a currency (aside from the darknet) - and as has pointed out, it does not appear to be many people.

It's difficult to know how much they actually make. They've only got a 1% margin on either a BUY or a SELL and its unlikely they get a significantly preferential rates on any exchanges they back-end off. So, for any trade that is not paired with a local counter-party (I.e. someone on Coinbase wanting to BUY at approximately the same time someone else wants to SELL), they probably only pocket 0.5-0.8%. Matched counterparty trades are different since it can all be done internally, in which case they probably pocket the full 2% (1% per side).

Citation? Because that's not my recollection. As far as I was aware BitInstant was forced out of business by a host of issues, not least the duplicity of Charlie Shrem. No bank would deal with them as soon as they got wind of the criminal complaint, their third party providers shut down their business relationships and on top of that, BitInstants platform was awful. 
What's worst of all; he had the gall to lie outright to his co-director (Gareth Nelson) about the validity of seriously questionable transactions. Charlie Shrem holds the award for majority contributor to BitInstant's failings.

Mr Shrem didn't just turn a blind eye to facilitating these transactions, according the indictment he actively participated - providing Mr Faiella with preferential terms and enabling the circumvention of what (few) AML processes BitInstant had in place.
BitInstant was not one person. It was co-owned by Gareth Nelson (A UK citizen living in Wales). At its height BitInstant had (allegedly) over 10 employees. These individuals have not been arrested. 
Charlie Shrem is accused of not just being economical with the law, but outright flouting it. You can have little sympathy for such naive stupidity.

It's a Microsoft Exchange feature. It's not related to email per-say, but basically the 'Recall' feature allows an email that hasn't been read but has been delivered to a Microsoft Exchange email server, to be deleted. 
It's very specific functionality, and it won't work for Microsoft Exchange instances across different companies, so basically it'd probably only have worked for recipients on the  email server who hadn't actually read the email. Everyone else (i.e people outside the usdoj) just gets another email saying "XXX has tried to recall this message".

No, they accept USD. Coinbase or BitPay accept the Bitcoin on their behalf and immediately liquidate all (or most) straight back into FEDERAL USD. Besides, it doesn't matter if every merchant on the planet accepts Bitcoin if no consumer wants to pay in it. If you want recent evidence of Bitcoins abject failure in this regard, look no further than Coindesks recent article about [Overstock sales figures](    


You're really clutching at straws here. There has been significant media coverage of Bitcoin but ultimately, that hasn't and won't translate into converts. It offers *nothing* that the average person doesn't already have with their existing payment or wealth preservation mechanisms and in most cases falls short of the features and functionality offered by current mainstream incumbents. 


Really? So, how has the block size been resolved? The non-deterministic and slow block times? The risks of a hard forks? The refactoring of magic numbers and the mechanisms to roll out new features and functionality like Peter Todds CHECKTIMELOCKVERIFY? 
Nothing has been **solved**. There is no concrete upgrade path and certainly not one that carries the near zero risk required for a financial network. 


Just because it's open, doesn't mean it's good or offers people more than closed equivalents.

I don't follow how tipping can be seen as a 'killer app'. Taking Coinbase's example; if I tip 0.10 USD (300 bits), and use the Bitcoin Address option - I'd actually end up paying 0.13 inclusive of the transaction fee (0.0001 BTC - whatever that is in bits...). 
Otherwise, if I use Coinbase-&gt;Coinbase it's free, but then...what's the point? I might as well use PayPal to tip someone. 
It's the same with ChangeTip - what exactly is the point? ChangeTip might as well denominate in USD and pay out to your PayPal address when you reach a threshold. Most of the tips fired around are so low they are barely more than the network transaction fee (which becomes greater as the Bitcoin price rises...if it does), making withdrawal nonviable. Besides they are all centralized through ChangeTip anyway. 
It just seems like a pointless fad that went viral and will die-out as quickly as it rose to prominence.

...was not the only accusation against him. Read the [criminal complaint](
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:01:22
Bitstamp won't get a reason because the bank is not obligated to provide one. Generally, the reason it'll have been denied is because:
a) The recipients bank account has been flagged (could be for suspected fraud, criminal links, money laundering etc); and/or 
b) The transfer has been deemed anomalous and has been subject to an internal manual review and this has caused it to be rejected. If the banks internal policies disallow anything Bitcoin related, and this transfer contained the word Bitcoin when reviewed by a member of the compliance team, it would have been rejected. It could also have been a random check, but the reasons behind the rejection would have been the same.
The rules that govern the transfer of money for institutions within the European Union are tight. Sovereign states must interpret the directives and their regulatory bodies must ensure they're enforced. 
Bitcoin is poison - it is unregulated, irreversible (making it an ideal candidate for housing fraudulently obtained fiat) and predominately backed by criminal activity at this point. While this situation may change if adoption spreads and regulatory guidance is forthcoming, at the current time only the most adventurous financial institutions will engage with Bitcoin businesses. The rest will flat out disavow it.

Credit card companies categorize transactions depending on where they occur and the type of charge incurred. Typically, if you make a cash withdrawal from a cash-machine on a credit card this is categorized as a 'cash advance', where-as if you were to use your credit-card to buy an Ikea Sofa, it would be categorized as normal charge. 
This categorization has the upshot of allowing your card provider (typically your bank) to charge different interest rates and apply different charging structures to different the different categories of debt you run up on your card. 
They can also limit the things your card can be used for (E.g. for funding gambling websites) or from being used in certain regions/countries etc. 
'Cash advances' are typically one of the most expensive debt categories to rack up on any credit card.

A currency needs stability. Bitcoin has demonstrated time and time again that it cannot offer that. This makes it unsuitable for the general populace, regardless of the quasi-religous furor of its proponents.


Did you actually take a look at the technology or just make a blanket decision that "it's crap, because...Bitcoin". 
Pragmatically, it should be a matter of the best tool for the job. Idealism and blind loyalty to *one specific brand* doesn't serve to increase mainstream traction of crypto-currencies or, frankly, make the eco-systems participants wealthier. 
It's a strangely blinkered attitude, which is odd since - and perhaps I'm generalizing - most of us I believe share the common belief that crypto-currencies are a pretty amazing invention. 
Bitcoin paved the way, but it's limitations have been exposed. That's not a slight against Bitcoin - it's a practical reality of the evolving landscape. Clinging to the incumbent *just because* doesn't help anyone.

This sounds really interesting. If the merchant (tx recipient) could opt to effectively increase the fee for a given transaction, either by adding their own input or jiggling the distribution of the outputs to increase the sacrificial fee, that would be a massive improvement.

You might want to address your concerns to - my understanding is that it doesn't obfuscate the trail, making the linkages between the inputs and the outputs (reasonably) trivial to establish.
I believe that traditional anonymizers used independent wallets and variable sized, variable number of outputs, ensuring the hosting platform (E.g. Bitcoin Fog) was the only one that could connect the original input to the 'cleaned' outputs. Of course they claim they delete this data, but...
CoinJoin (SharedCoin is based on I believe) mixes everything together in a single transaction - since a tx can consist of multiple inputs and outputs (Bitstamp uses the similar mechanism for processing Bitcoin withdrawals). While the attribution of outputs can be random, if it's 1:1 (or 1:M, but with multiple outputs to the same destination address) and/or the entropy of input values is low - it's pretty simple to work out which inputs are going to which outputs, ergo an expensive (1.5%?) service that doesn't obscure very much...

You need to wait for only 1 confirmation generally. As soon as it's confirmed, you'll be able to send the deposit on. How long one confirmation takes can be anywhere from less than a 1 minute to an hour or more...

That's what pretty much all currency conversion companies do. It's especially easy with Bitcoin since the variance between exchanges is typically huge meaning that pinning down a market price is difficult - Coindesk, BitcoinAverage, Winkdex and many others all try, but since their input criterion all vary, so does the resultant 'market price' they display.
Also, don't forget that buying or selling Bitcoin - even on an exchange - is not free (Chinese exchanges exempted). If you're a light trader, you're looking at typically ~0.5% on top of whatever the exchanges best price is, in addition to any fiat withdrawal or deposit costs the exchange also imposes. These all add up and can add a not insignificant premium to the the base 'market price'.

It's too volatile, and there is no mechanism to mediate that volatility. Case in point; the sub-reddit is cheering the demolition of the 'BearWhalePig' 30K wall. 
If that guy had liquidated with a market order, he could have brought the price to almost zero on Bitstamp. Other exchanges would have likely followed suit - though bots and zealous traders would have mediated the effects. 
Either way, if you're BitPay or Coinbase and tracking the price for the purposes of converting merchant BTC to fiat, it's incredibly risky and opens them up to potentially horrendous losses - especially if they need to convert instantly and some 'whale' has absorbed all the liquidity and crashed the price. Don't forget, this was likely one holder - there are many others out there with likely equally large holdings...
Bitcoin's price vs fiat is just too susceptible to this volatility and that's one of the main reasons it's basically a rubbish currency. Everyone aside from speculators wants stability from a currency, not volatility.

That's not really the point though. The United States has - at a federal level - effectively sanctioned highway robbery. No criminal conviction or even accusation of criminal wrong-doing is required to seize funds.
Not only that, but the incentives for those who can exercise this privilege - law enforcement officers - are significant. Seized funds go towards local division funding pools and if unchallenged are *reallocated* internally.

Bitstamp Service Temporarily Suspended
We have reason to believe that one of Bitstamp’s operational wallets was compromised on January 4th, 2015.
As a security precaution against compromises Bitstamp only maintains a small fraction of customer bitcoins in online systems. Bitstamp maintains more than enough offline reserves to cover the compromised bitcoins.
IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE DEPOSITS TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BITCOIN DEPOSIT ADDRESSES. THEY CANNOT BE HONORED!
Customer deposits made prior to January 5th, 2015 9:00 UTC are fully covered by Bitstamp’s reserves. Deposits made to newly issued addresses provided after January 5th, 2015 9:00 UTC can be honored.
Bitstamp takes our security and soundness very seriously. In an excess of caution, we are suspending service as we continue to investigate. We will return to service and amend our security measures as appropriate.

I don't see how this change will ever get accepted. From the perspective of the miners there don't seem to be any real benefits, only risks. For a miner, the downsides to not adopting SegWit - such as increased confirmation times because of competition for finite block space - only lead to increasing fees.
Simple fact is that Bitcoins brand is ubiquitous. The threat of altcoin's supplanting it has simply not materialized. Even the much heralded Ethereum exists without a purpose (aside from speculation). 
Bitcoin can easily be bought and sold through numerous channels - the same cannot be said for its competitors. There are products and services (read: narcotics) that are available only by paying with Bitcoin and all the wallets and services using the Bitcoin protocol are currently interoperable. 
As it stands everything works (just about) and everyone's getting paid, so what's the demonstrable financial incentive to challenging the status-quo?
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:56:50
Probably because it would end up drawing the same conclusions. The only sector that actual thrives (and keeps the cash flowing into crypto) is the narcotics markets. 
You can get an idea of just how huge they are becoming by the recent closure of a small player called [Babylon Market]( which allegedly had over 1 million EUR in deposits seized. 
The darknets are probably accounting for close to 90% of the actual traffic in Bitcoin - the remaining 10% is divided amongst speculators, libertarians and the Bitcoin faithful. As a consequence, the only legitimate companies that truly make money are those providing fiat on/off ramps for crypto. Good for the likes of Coinbase, bad for companies like BitPay.

None. You'll need to use a P2P provider - [Bittybot]( has a list of all your options. If you want to wire money to Coinbase, you can do so by depositing to their account with LHV bank (Estonia I think). It's a wire transfer, but the Coinbase account is denominated in GBP so you may be able to avoid any unfavorable currency FX rates imposed by your local bank (Make sure they send the funds as GBP, not EUR). You will still pay the wire transfer fee though (between 4 to 25 GBP, depending on your bank)

They're not interested in Bitcoin. The [Proof of Concept]( with Safello is extremely unlikely to go anywhere when/if it's ever released.
Banks do love blockchain technology though, specifically the use of existing stacks for their own private blockchains to reduce costs among other benefits. Whether these institutions choose to run Bitcoin's stack in a private context or one of the competitors (Nxt, Ethereum, Custom variant etc) is still an open question and we won't know the answers until previously hyped solutions (like the NASDAQ OpenAssets-based trial) are brought to market.

That wasn't the point. The point was that the debt wasn't settled in fiat (or similar token with equivalent monetary value), rather it was settled on the basis of a promise of future returns greater than the sum of the outstanding debt. 
Clearing ~70 million USD of debt in the space of ~8 months would imply a profit generation rate 8.75 million / month, which would make them quite a valuable company.

It's not. This offers nothing more than a GBP/BTC pair on their exchange and the ability to deposit into a GBP denominated account at their bank (Note: note UK bank account - just a European bank account denominated in GBP). 
All your financial transfers are still made to Coinbase's European bank (LHV), which, coincidentally is the same one Coinfloor uses, and therefore incur the standard wire transfer fees. 
Also, unless Coinbase are using a consolidated order-book (ala Mt Gox used to use) - the GBP/BTC pair is going to be pretty weak on volume. Unless they prop it up themselves of course.

In practical terms, at least one darknet market implemented multi-sig exclusively - *The Marketplace* or *TMP* as it was known (Hard as they tried, their implementation never caught on despite step-by-step documentation and some pretty snazzy UI stuff.

But it's only exchanges, payment brokerages (like Coinbase) and darknet markets that are actually making *profit*. 
On top of that, the only exchanges that are making money are those that were there at the beginning (first mover advantage), BitFinex among them or offer near zero or zero fees (Chinese exchanges). There have been countless casualties even in this arena (see: Vault of Satoshi for a recent example). 
In addition, those exchanges that are making money are doing so at the expense of others. Bitstamp (for example) has seen a steady decline in trading volume (even before the hack), and that volume has likely transitioned to the East Asian exchanges such as Bitfinex, OKCoin etc. 
The actual growth in Bitcoin usage outside of the darknet and speculation is still relatively non existent.

Banks don't have to provide you with a reason. The only group they are obliged to provide a reason for refusal or closure to is law enforcement or an oversight body such as the Financial Ombudsman. 
The banking sector in the UK has since the record HSBC money laundering fine, been slowly - and with only a few notable exceptions - ending its relationships with businesses in the [money service sector]( Many of these relations they were obliged to provide back in circa 2000-2005 in legislation that opened up payment service provision (I think it was the PSR's inherited from Europe, but I might be wrong). 
If you try to open a UK business bank account in a sector classified as a money service business (traditional forex, pawn broker etc), your chances of success are near-zero. If you try to open a business bank account citing crypto currencies as your activity - your chances of a positive outcome are absolute zero. 
It's not just a matter of risk. MSB's and crypto businesses are competition to the banking sector which is private and commercial (and also a huge tax revenue generator when it's not gambled it all away and requires largesse from the tax payer to restock the piggy bank). Theoretically, it answers to regulators, but in actuality it answers to no one. 
If you think that these pronouncements from HMRC or the Treasury are going to suddenly cause banks to open their arms to crypto businesses, I think you'll be sadly disappointed. The only exception is if legislation compels them to do it - but you're more likely to see the sun go dark before that happens.

It's likely Coinbase are adding a lot of new customers - they just aren't updating the metrics. Not because Bitcoin is popular, but because the darknets are - and word is getting round that narcotics-to-your-door really does work and Coinbase is one of the only company's with a bank account (Silicon Valley Bank) connecting them to the FIAT financial system. 
You can gauge how popular this market sector is becoming by the recent seizure of a darknet vendor in Germany (ShinyFlakes) -  
 
This was **one** vendor with maybe a dozen listings. Now, extrapolate that against the listings on Evolution (close to 20,000 at last count), and that's just one darknet market - there are at least 10 known markets in operation.
Coinbase provide an easy onramp for those who have no technical experience to get their first Bitcoins and by association, their first *package in the post*. 
Maybe Coinbase make a belated attempt to flag a few transactions, but most go through unimpeded. They are the defacto on-ramp for those wanting the Facebook experience for obtaining their narcotic funds.

The problem is that what you're proposing doesn't address the fundamental question of communication outside of the darknet market on which the transaction took place. You need to reach at least one counter party to actually begin the process or releasing trapped funds.

Except PayPal has traceability on the origin of the funds. It's reasonably likely that the OP's limits have been reduced because there is a degree of suspicion about the origin of the crypto-funds and the regularity of the withdrawals. 
Since Circle can't necessarily prove the funds originated from criminal undertakings (tumbling through even one intermediary exchange would break/heavily obfusticate the link of funds withdrawn from a darknet market), they just reduce the limits. This makes their service unfeasible for the extraction of any materially useful fiat volume, forcing those *bad actors* to seek other off-ramps.

BitShares BitUSD (and assets in general) offer many enhancements over Bitcoin. Some specifics are; deterministic confirmation times (15 seconds), reduced cost of network operation (Delegated Proof of Stake vs the insanely expensive Proof of Work Bitcoin uses) and finally, a predictable mechanism for managing software upgrades through the 101 delegates (equivalent to miners in Bitcoin).  
If they manage to gain traction - and the determining factor here will be their ability to convince FIAT&lt;-&gt;Crypto conversion services to support them - I suspect BitShares adoption will begin to snowball. Unfortunately, I suspect the bter.com incident hasn't helped them, so it might be a while...

So, explain to me how you will make unspendable funds spendable if the darknet market on which your transaction was undertaken goes down and you now need the counterparty (the vendor in this case) to release the funds either to you, or to them?
It only *solves* the problem if all parties can communicate outside of the market upon which the transaction took place and then reach agreement over which party should receive the locked funds.
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:36:47
Welcome to Bitcoin. To be honest, you might want to use a cheaper provider with less overhead - [bittybot]( lists them all - so you're not stung so much in a downturn. Bittylicious is generally quite a bit above spot market rate. 
Also the rate on bittylicious website is what you paid I suspect, not the actual market value of Bitcoin at the time. Your screenshot shows blockchain.info, and that converts your Bitcoin value to the equivalent GBP value at the market rate. In otherwords, if you were to pay 50 GBP to bittylicious and then plug the value of the received BTC into Google (XXX BTC in GBP), you'd probably see how much of a premium you are paying.

Seems a bit of a misunderstanding about how Bitcoin is transferred. If you want to blur the trail, transfer to a high volume intermediary such as an exchange where your withdrawal will in all likelihood use a complete different set of transactions as inputs from an independent wallet with no link to your original deposit transaction. 
For example; Transfer from Circle/Coinbase to OKCoin to whatever gambling/darknet/other source. You can go further and add a few more intermediary's to break the links. Just make sure that your first hop is not on the Circle/Coinbase list of prohibited entities. You can (or could) also plug your deposit address into [Blockseer.com]( to see what Coinbase/Circle see. Can be quite illuminating.  
Just transferring to an intermediate private wallet (E.g. Electrum) or low volume wallet on a third party where your original deposit transaction may be used in the withdrawal or it's easy to track an equivilent amount out of the deposit wallet doesn't help obscure the flow of the capital, just adds extra hops that cost you time and money.

It looks like an incorrect tl;dr from the link you posted. In reference to the 250 EUR card limit, it says:
* (a) the payment instrument is not reloadable, or has a maximum monthly payment transactions limit of EUR 250 which can be used only in that Member State;
* (b) the maximum amount stored electronically does not exceed EUR 250;
* (c) the payment instrument is used exclusively to purchase goods or services;
* **(d) the payment instrument cannot be funded with anonymous electronic money;**
* (e) the issuer carries out sufficient monitoring of the transactions or business relationship to enable the detection of unusual or suspicious transactions.
So, no more Bitcoin funded anonymous pre-pay cards.

Some have solved this.

It's not terrorism I don't think. Basically, Coinbase front you the Bitcoins with their instant transfers because ACH takes 1-4? days to actually clear. This has led to some problems ( hence the recent reduction to 10BTC instant purchases.
The big problem you've got as a seller of Bitcoins is that they are truly irreversible and nearly anonymous. Pretty much any other form of fiat payment (apart from face to face cash purchases) is not - that includes bank wires. Here's a recent interesting scam involving cash deposits:  
In the beginning it was super easy (relatively) to buy Bitcoins in the US (BitInstant springs to mind), but slowly regulation and increasing financial losses on the part of sellers have caused a not unexpected clampdown. 
Purchasing prerequisites are now more onerous, prices are higher, limits are lower, the whole experience is significantly less user friendly. But unfortunately that's what happens when you get rampant fraud - no one wants to be left without a chair when the music stops.

That's a really great idea. Lets look at some of the concerns; From the parking company's perspective there would seem to be three inherent disadvantages to the incumbent models; 1) the parking company is locked in to a vendor specific solution (hardware, software etc etc), 2) the number of intermediaries taking a cut eats in to their potential profit (mobile company, software vendor, hardware vendor etc) 3) Any solution they choose cannot be significantly more expensive to the customer than paying by traditional means - for example - hard currency into a slot. 
From a customers perspective there would seem to be significant fragmentation in the current market of '21st century' parking payment solutions; Some parking vendors use SMS (mobile), some require you to pre-pay on a website, some use phone numbers staffed by offshore personnel, some make you install bespoke applications etc. Each of these has it's drawbacks, most incur overhead - someone has to pay...usually the customer.
Bitcoin would theoretically allow a parking services company to 'shop around' for service provision while harmonizing the client experience across countries and borders for customers. Since transactions are generally low value, it would make sense for any service provider backending the solution to accept zero confirmations. The 'message' field that exists on Bitcoin transactions could also be used by customers to identify their location and vehicle registration (akin to the way some existing vendors use it for with SMS). It would be pretty simple for the backend system to map incoming transactions and push updates to a parking inspectors hardware (E.g. smartphone). The whole cost of implementing the solution could use off the shelf hardware (smartphones), signed QR codes (as suggested by another poster in this thread), wifi or 3G/LTE networks for communciation - heck you could even use old 2.5g/EDGE since the actual data packet sizes are so small. Customers would require a smartphone and likely an app but there would be no reason the app couldn't be decoupled from the payment solution service provider (kind of like instant messaging clients that let you communicate over loads of networks simultaneously). 
Overall there is an opportunity for  drastically reducing costs for a parking company while allowing entrants who are serviced by mobile data networks but don't have the capital to spend on expensive existing solutions, to monetize their parking space. 
Kudos, pretty sweet idea.

Unlikely. What's significantly more likely is that 'they' are getting scared by the fact they're pretty much the go-to exchange in Mt.Gox's protracted absence and fear the searchlight being turned on them (if it hasn't already).
Just so you are aware; collecting a few pictures and printing a few words about AML does not an AML policy make. The requirements in the UK alone are onerous, invasive and bureaucratic. Granted; Bitstamp is a Slovenian business running a front company in the UK (Bitstamp Ltd), but since they cite compliance under UK laws you would have expected them to have come up with something a more inline with existing providers in the financial space. 
This move smacks of reactionary fear, nothing more.

Hype is the driving force. Hype has created a tsunami of greed but like all waves, eventually it will hit the shore. 
It's pretty evident that speculative gambling on a globally accessible scale is the main driver, you only have to look at the astronomical increase in 'altcoin' prices across the board - E.g. LTC from 12 USD to 40 USD in a matter of hours.
If Bitcoin hasn't actually achieved any penetration in the real economy (as in people buying it to use, not to speculate, big business adopting it etc), what on earth justifies the meteoric rise of altcoins? 
A meltdown will likely occur and alot of people will lose a lot of money, the question of course is how much further will it go before the event horizon...

Seems pretty risky venture. Fine (for them) if BTC increases in price vs when the customer purchased but bad if it tanks (and it does have a wonderful habit of tanking). If it did go down for any sustained period, this company could quite conceivably fold under the weight of its liabilities - assuming it doesn't have a bottomless pit of VC dollars from which to fund its customers who "bought high". 
Frankly I reckon you're better off sticking with BTC o'natural, warts and all.

The triggers are typically;
- Transactions to/from accounts that are already flagged (stolen, under investigation etc)
- High transaction frequency (not necessarily large, but funds received from and sent to many accounts)
- Large currency movement (Transactions 2-3K+ between personal accounts always raise red flags)
- Cash deposits (Big, shiny red flag - because they're perceived as anonymous)

I know that reading this is probably going to be about as helpful as a soap hacksaw, but you've got to be very careful about dumping large amounts of cash through personal accounts. Most banks offer reduced fees and have reduced expectations about these accounts (because they don't anticipate much in the way of traffic - regular paychecks, bills etc) - so large or frequent anomalous traffic to disparate third parties sets off all sorts of alarm bells.
If it's any consolation, you're not the first:  (there are countless other examples on the localbitcoin forums, the bitcointalk.org forum and even on reddit).

It probably is a pretty smart move. Remember, PayPal did a semi-similar thing when they first started. They offered new customers $10 to signup (fell to $5 later on).
This strategy would seem more about driving wider adoption rather than cannibalizing market share from other players. Many potential merchants are likely still hesitant about adopting Bitcoin and this serves as a big enticement.

Do you have a source for that? I'm curious because I read on bitcointalk.org (I cannot find the thread at this time unfortunately) that Coinbase use ACH to transfer your cash so, in effect, they front the Bitcoins since ACH takes ~2-4 days to clear.
The individual (OP) in the thread had initiated an instant bank transaction but did not actually have the required funds in his account at the time (iirc his friend forgot to deposit them or something), however Coinbase had still instantly supplied him the BTC. The ACH transaction eventually failed and Coinbase marked his account as in deficit for the BTC they had fronted him. 
The thread was innocuous enough, with the OP asking Coinbase to get in contact so he could reinstate his account L2 Verified status (I believe they'd cancelled it) and return them their owed fiat monies however, this was likely a massive green light to those who like to take advantage (read: scam) and figured 50 BTC was a price worth losing their Coinbase account over. I'm not saying that they (Coinbase) actually experienced an increase in failed ACH's as a result of this, or if they just acted preemptively to shut down this avenue of (potentially expensive) attack. I'd be interested to know either way...

There is practically no chance that TransferWise will offer any BTC option in the near-medium term. Why? Because Bitcoin is not - in legal terms - a currency. In fact, the UK stance (and the one being adopted by other major European countries such as Germany) is that Bitcoin is a VAT-able commodity (a credit voucher is the official designation by HMRC) and as such subject to VAT on sales. 
Here is some interesting reading: 
In addition; TransferWise use Barclays as their financial institution - as do pretty much all the Foreign Exchange companies (UKForex, TransferWise, 1stContactForex etc) - and Barclays are currently the *most* anti-MSB bank in the UK financial services sector (see: Dahabshiil -  It was Barclays who ordered TransferWise to cease funds transmission to BTC exchanges or they would close their account with immediate effect. When your business requires a bank account to operate, that's a pretty big incentive to tow the line.

The problem is, he's right. There are significant problems with Bitcoin as it stands. Some of the most glaring were highlighted in the recent 17-19 November run-up. 
Firstly; Transaction volume increased considerably and transactions were not confirming for hours (days in some cases). The reason for this was the lack of 'fees' that were attached to new transactions (the gravy miners get in addition to the block reward). The stock client (and most other wallets) only impose a transaction fee when the size of the transaction (measured in KB) exceeds 1KB - it's then 0.0001 BTC per KB thereafter. The idea was to prevent malicious actors spamming the Bitcoin network, and killing confirmation times for everyone. The problem was that greedy miners were cherry picking transactions with fees and allocating only ~60 'fee free' transactions per block. At one point over 6000 transactions were languishing in purgatory - see: 
Secondly; Transaction fee's are currently fixed with respect to the cost of sending a transaction. Now although you can send transactions without any fee's attached, as demonstrated above - this only works when the network isn't busy. Assuming you now have to include a 0.0001 BTC transaction fee every-time you send someone BTC may not sound that bad until you come to calculate that in equivilent FIAT. To provide a concrete example (lifted from:  - Assuming 1 BTC is currently 797 USD (src: Coinmill). The cost of sending a transaction with the minimum fee attached in order to obtain reasonable confirmation times, becomes: 8 CENTS. As Bitcoin's gains value - the cost rises. Again, citing the topic above - 1,100 USD on BTC China equated to 0.11 CENTS to send a transaction... There are developments in progress (Gavin Andresen's 'Smart Fee' work) but they are not here now. Consider that it costs 99 CENTS to buy an MP3 on iTunes and you get some idea of how such costs serve to significantly undermine wide-scale merchant adoption, especially for micro-payments.
Thirdly (and probably most insidiously); The block-size limit. You can only fit a certain number of transactions inside a block. Blocks can be scaled to approximately 1MB in size without requiring a hard-fork. This 1MB limit offers approximately 2500 transactions per block. Where each block is created at 10 minute intervals, this gives you a maximum number 4.2 transactions per second. After that you starting getting queues of transactions forming, regardless of the fee... see  - we're currently at ~10% of this limit, but if growth increases exponentially, so will traffic leading too...
Finally; the hard-fork scenario. A hard-fork is basically a change that is not backward compatible to all clients on the Bitcoin network; everybody has to upgrade basically otherwise you get 2 block-chains forming. This is incredibly bad for business because, when two (or more) chains form, only the winning chain becomes valid. This means at the point a Bitcoin client accepts the new chain, any transactions that have occurred in the old (now discarded chain) up to the point they diverged become invalid. So, if a hard-fork happens and it *has* happened before (src:  you may find transactions you've conducted suddenly get rolled back if the chain you are on doesn't turn out to be the winner....for merchants this could be a nightmare. You'd either have to suspend operations during the fork - assuming you knew - or you'd risk finding you'd sold goods / services for payments that no longer were credited to you.
Bitcoin is a great first step, but it is not perfect. It will improve, but blindly ignoring its shortcomings could be *very* expensive. To paraphrase the words of Darth Vadar; "Don't be too proud of this technological money you've constructed"

Problem with TOR is that it's slow and Freedom Hosting offered fast, responsive servers...ideal for the burgeoning dubiously legal business with a growing user-base... and Silk Road has not been slow. Of course, the information could also have been passed from the all seeing eye at the NSA, although they apparently aren't into sharing unless a requester can demonstrate that the information could be obtained in some other manner (thus leaving the NSA out of the picture).... it's all speculation - I doubt we'll ever know exactly 'how' they did it :\

You are absolutely right of course. Bitcoin is currently pretty useless except for legally dubious activities which - in essence - form the basis for its only 'real' economy. 
There was an interesting thread from some individual/company that actually deployed Bitcoin in the real world here:  that shows just how immature the technology still is and how the assertions of widespread adoption in meccas like Berlin, Germany are grossly overstated: 
 
Bitcoin is a great proof of concept, but with the regulatory ambiguity, the general usability constraints (slow, easy to lose all your funds through tech failure) - there will be no mainstream adoption anytime soon. Sure, these can both be addressed (BIP 70 being a prime example on the software side and regulatory engagement from the legal side), but they're still issues now.
Until this stuff gets fixed Bitcoin is going nowhere with the mainstream, regardless of the utopian vision the zealots like to paint.

There is one reason that Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme and that's the existence of a real economy denominated (almost) exclusively in Bitcoins. That economy is Drugs, Gambling and Arms provided by Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded, Atlantis and the numerous Bitcoin gambling sites among others. 
Because the services or wares on these markets can only be purchased with crypto currency and the wares/services are sought by a broad spectrum of the general populace who would otherwise be disinterested in crypto-currency technology, this forces a steady stream of fiat capital into the crypto economy and gives Bitcoins an inherent value. 
Put simply; your average young adult, white or blue collar worker only cares about Bitcoin because he wants the products denominated exclusively in it without the hassle of obtaining them through traditional means - the Amazon experience - which they cannot get with traditional fiat payment methods.
If Silk Road et al were to ditch Bitcoin for some newfangled technology - the value would likely tend towards zero overnight.

This argument "cash is also used for illegal activity" crops up time and time again. Yes, cash is used for illegal activity but not *predominantly* for illegal activity. The greatest use cases for Bitcoin at this point (and the reason fresh capital in the form of dollars, pounds, euros, yen etc flows in) is because of;
-&gt; drugs
-&gt; gambling (including speculation)
-&gt; money laundering
-&gt; porn
-&gt; everything else
Of course, you could call this post out and say "what proof do you have of this?" - well, you'd be right, there is no hard and fast evidence. However, looking subjectively at types of websites that have sprung up for Bitcoin in the past four years; money transmission (Coinbase, Mt Gox, Bit Instant etc), gambling (SatoshiDice, Just Dice, Prime Dice etc)  in the public web and of course Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded and Atlantis to name a few of the dark web popular favorites and the dearth of 'mainstream' websites (no mainstream company accepts Bitcoin), it's fairly obvious what a majority of Bitcoin's users are acquiring it for. 
Realistically, Bitcoins are too expensive (1-15% fees to acquire them), too inflexible (you can't buy much with them other than the above) and too volatile (+/-20% movement per day is not a good store of wealth) vs Western currencies to make them palatable for adoption other than by those who wish to use them for dubious means.
Crypto currency has a future - not sure if it's Bitcoin though. Certainly in the near future Bitcoin is not likely to shift the bulk of its use cases from illegitimate to legitimate.

That's the wrong answer. Your bank is legally obliged under the Payment Services Regulations 2009 to be authorised and regulated by the FCA as a Credit Institution. They can't obtain a banking license and therefore be a bank *unless* they are regulated. 
The question then becomes; do you need to be registered or authorised by the FCA? If you're operating as a flat out Bitcoin trader; no - because Bitcoins are not money as defined as indicated in Part 1 - 2 (1) of the PSR 2009:
"funds" means banknotes and coins, scriptural money, and electronic money as defined in Article 1(3)(b) of the electronic money directive. 
However, you're taking customers GBP funds and holding them for the purposes of exchange. Now, a Bureau De Change does not come under the umbrella of FCA supervision, but they crucially do not hold customer funds. Bureau de Change does however fall under HMRC as the supervisory authority and require a money transmission license. 
So, where this puts you I do not know but if I were inclined to bet I'd put you squarely in the 'operating illegally and without a clue' category. You clearly haven't read or don't actually understand the legislation; this includes the PSR's 2009, Counter Terrorism Act 2008 and Money Laundering Regulations 2007 - all or some of which will apply to your business model. I'm not even going to touch on your verification processes which seem wholly non existent and so make you a ripe target for fraud - and for the record *one* fraudulent transaction from a stolen bank account will have your bank accounts closed.

Likely a sensible decision. The recent price rise appears to be driven purely by speculation rather than any real economic use of BTC (E.g. remittance, e-commerce etc). The Chinese Baidu news was inflated out of all proportion; afterall it was just a division of Baidu (Jiasule) that offers anti-DDOS / web threat mitigation services that began accepting BTC...not exactly a vendor of products aimed at the average Chinese consumer. 
In addition, there have been no developments in key US and European markets. There are a lot of payment providers (BitPay, BIPS etc) and exchanges (Kraken, Vault of Satoshi, Bitcoin-Central to name a few recent ones) but little else... 
Granted Chinese BTC exchanges are trading huge volumes, but since there isn't much you can do with BTC at this point as far as interacting with the fiat economy goes, it seems likely the Chinese (like the Americans/Europeans in April before them) are speculating and like all good speculators, no one will want to be left without a chair when the music stops. There was a rather prophetic article on Mashable about this circa April 2013: 
You might want to reinvest a small portion of the profits you've made, play with 'house money' if you will. At least that way if it does continue its speculative rise you've still got one toe in the pond and if it tanks, you'll still be in a better position than when you initially invested.

You may be able to argue that A) Bank transfers are final and B) UK Bank accounts (well certainly Barclays, LLoyds, TSB (probably since it was part of LLoyds), Santandar, HSBC) all implement two factor to permit transactions. E.g. For HSBC, You've got to enter a PIN number from a token if its a new recipient - same with Barclays and LLoyds ring you up and make you enter a code. 
Anyway, long story short - the buyer must have explicitly authorized the addition of you as a new recipient - so 'my account was stolen' probably shouldn't wash....unless the source bank doesn't implement 2 factor. Basically you can say; Buyer is taking you for a ride or its his/her own negligence - I am not at fault.

But since everyone's speculating 'how low will it go'; I'll go with $23-30

It's great for communicating with trusted peers. I personally use it to exchange 'sensitive' information with colleagues while at work. Stuff you wouldn't want archived in perpetuity on a corporate email server (cat's in hats youtube links, that's sort of thing :P).
They (my colleagues) can just plug in a usb pen drive, connect to the BM network and receive any broadcasts from our group.
Currently - for me at least - it kind-of fits more into an Instant Message client bracket then an email replacement, and I've got to say once you start using it, you really find out how useful it is.

Not really that stupid. BitInstant continued operating despite significant shortcomings in their system (see  - Page 404 is a good example) and the fact they continued to deny there were problems ( *and still took peoples money*. 
What's even more galling is that they (now) on their website actually show how many tickets they had in their queue when they called it quits:  (*17297 tickets*- clearly the sign of a well run company that had no difficulties at all). 
The page is replicated here in case they take it down (they often do that when they spot criticism): 
Frankly, they deserve everything they get.

Agreed - see PayPal and Butterfly Labs;  - Once PayPal has handed over the cash, their position is weakened and they have to eat the loss from irate customers. I think credit card charge-backs can extend well past the 45 day fraud window PayPal provides. 
You can't really blame PayPal for looking after PayPal.

It is 99% likely that some of the identity documents or account information you submitted to Bitstamp failed retrospective verification. Bitstamp have contracted the services of GB Groups' ID3Global identity verification platform. It permits batch submission and verification of data (this includes scanned images) and something you have submitted has caused it fail you. If you changed your address recently, your name has changed (married/divorced etc), you have submitted forged or inaccurate identity documents or the platform has confused you with someone else, you will have been scored negatively which will undoubtedly have resulted in the email you received.

Assume they are. All these sites are the same, frequently hastily constructed and poorly coded, using off the shelf frameworks leaving them rife with vulnerabilities.

My statement was meant to be taken in the context of the overarching thread - I should have made this clear, apologies. As far as I am aware, Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded and the recent Sheep Market all use(d) Open Source frameworks as the basis for their sites. 


While I agree that for a majority of solutions they're great, but I'd question if they are the right fit for a black market website where *one mistake* can and will lead to your downfall. 


Partially, but more as another arrow to the bow than as a single solution. If your team has written the software, they should have a good understanding about how the various parts interact. The same cannot be said for something you just download from the internet, performed cursory customization on and then released, trusting blindly to faith that all avenues have been covered.
 


Perhaps this approach would work for you, I'd question if it's working for the remaining incumbents in this space...

The indictment lists 23rd July (I think) as the time the FBI received an image of the web server as part of a foreign treaty agreement (i can't find the page because the PDF isn't OCR'd, but if you read it you'll come across it:  
Basically, from that you can probably infer that Silk Road was hosted with Freedom Hosting in Ireland, and that's where they (the FBI) 'got their break'. There does not appear to be anything (or maybe I just missed it) to suggest in the indictment that they had made any real progress attributing SR ownership before that point.

You could easily launder all your stolen Bitcoins through all of the major TOR drug sites (blackmarket reloaded, Silk Road and Atlantis). There are numerous anonymous mixers around as well (Bitcoin Fog rings a bell). You could also use some of the many gambling sites (Prime Dice etc), or sell them off on localbitcoins - the options are practically endless and that excludes solutions recently proposed in  
A thief cannot remove the 'taint' from a Bitcoin, but can completely break the link between themselves and the stolen Bitcoins with relative ease. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 18:18:47
Maybe - however Bitstamp based in Slovenia and therefore it's up to the Slovenian government to decide if its breaking any rules - not the USA or the UK. Although there are European directives governing money laundering and payment services, it is up to the member country to interpret and implement them. 
Ex Eastern block countries (Ukraine etc) are a haven for money laundering ( and other dubious activities. Don't forget, Cyprus is the same - that's the reason their depositors had to take a 'hair cut' (The Germans didn't want to be funding Russian crime lords).  
That being said; it is likely very risky to hold large amounts of either FIAT or BTC in any exchange, especially one which is rapidly replacing the incumbent Mt Gox. If Bitstamp does get raided - and it might - those with their funds in there stand to lose the lot. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:45:23
I don't follow this. If you CoinJoin with others and one of the inputs is tainted coins, your output address will likely receive some of the taint? A previously clean address linked to you which was used as an output would then be polluted with tainted funds in the eyes of the law - rendering its entire balance unspendable with companies participating in this scheme...
Secondly, how does this deal with me stuffing stolen funds into Just-dice, Black Market Reloaded or some of the numerous other indirect mixing services out there and then withdrawing them to my 'clean' spendable address? In this instance there is no guarantee that the illegal address will be be used as the input in any withdrawal transaction. You'd need buy in from *every* merchant illegal or otherwise to be able to deny tainted coins. 
This scheme seems completely unworkable, but perhaps I don't fully understand what they've done here.

They (BTC-E) can't really recover the funds if you've deposited them to the wrong account on their site. They've only got your word for it that it's the wrong account number and the funds may already have been spent.
In fairness, this seems to have been your mistake and you'll likely have to eat the loss.

"go design a better service" is not a solution. If I buy a pair of Nike shoes and they fall apart after a few days use, Nike don't tell me to "set up my own shoe factory and make my own shoes". 
If you're operating a business you have a duty to your customers to supply the services you advertise in the time-frames you advertise. Otherwise, leave it to the professionals. 
This isn't the first time Bitinstant have screwed up. They went for most of April operating an appallingly unacceptable level of service:
 (300 onwards)
Search BitInstant for more examples... smell the 'quality'
What's more galling is the fact they've allegedly transitioned to a "new" system to resolve these issues and it seems like its an untested bag of crap. It demonstrates the level of actual real world technical ability in the company is basically akin to that of a fresh faced University student. 
Contrast this to a service like Kraken which isn't even live, and the stark dichotomy between skill levels and approaches becomes apparent.

This is nonsense. Provided the transaction size is above the dust threshold - it *will* confirm eventually. The Bitcoin protocol automatically caters for such a scenario by increasing the priority of the transaction based on the age of the inputs, its size and other factors. Eventually, its priority will mandate it for inclusion in a block...the question is how long will you be waiting. It could be minutes, it could be days.

It might seem that way to start with (the unfriendly looking Bitcoin Addresses aka 'Account Numbers' don't help matters), but its not terribly complicated. 
With BitBargain you open an account. As part of that account you get a deposit Bitcoin Address which you can use if you want to SELL Bitcoins. If you send Bitcoins to this address, they will be credited to your BitBargain account. Think of it as the same as PayPal - if you want to spend money using PayPal, you've got to have that money in your PayPal account first. 
If you want to BUY Bitcoins on BitBargain, all you need to do is find a seller, negotiate a price and pay with the requested method (E.g. UK Bank transfer or Barclays Ping It). Once the seller receives payment, they'll release the Bitcoins you've bought to your Bitbargain account - you can then WITHDRAW the funds from Bitbargain to your blockchain.info wallet - the target would be the deposit address that blockchain.info gives you (the long string of characters in the gray box when you first log in). 
For a relatable example; think of receiving funds from someone through PayPal. Once you've got your funds into PayPal, you typically withdraw them to your bank account.

I thought I'd share some thoughts I've had about this unfortunate event and the subsequent (predictable) effect on the BTC price. Initially I took the view that many I suspect have, to rid myself of the Bitcoins for the safe haven of fiat. So I did this, and now the question became; do I buy back in? 
I couldn't see any positives to this situation; such a strong negative movement only reenforces detractors of Bitcoins position that it's merely a vehicle for crime - it surely would only lead to a continuing downward spiral as those who had been responsible for pumping fiat into Bitcoin to obtain wares denominated solely in Bitcoin took fright (Joe Public "Will the law break down my door"), and those who had supplied those wares attempted to cut their losses. But then one important point struck me that I believe has been overlooked by many. It's not gambling, it's not money laundering, wealth transfer or P2P payments, it's the Amazon experience...
Bitcoin has (for the first time) allowed Average Joe public to obtain drugs, guns and other legally dubious goods in relatively frictionless manner. Is the white collar worker (father of two, church going family) really now going to trade the ease, simplicity, recourse and guarantee of quality for its precursor; meeting down a dark backstreet at some ungodly hour to obtain some dubious substance from gentlemen so shady they're practically growing leaves.. The answer is of course; No. Amazon, eBay etc - the experience is now so commonplace and seamless it's like the adoption of 'Google' as a verb; they become so integrated you cannot remember a time without them. The masses want this and the memory and fear of the potential risk (especially if nothing happens to *them*) fades fast...
The average person who likes their iGadgets is not going to go back to the dark old days. To use the old cliche; The amber nectar has been tasted - after a short shock, the masses will be looking for alternatives (Black Market Reloaded, Sheep Market etc) and once they find them, the cycle will be back. I don't think the genie is going back in the bottle.
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:33:27
That potential has weakened though. My own personal view is that that there are two reasons, one begets the other;
1) The inability of any US bitcoin business to - so far - obtain any sort of legitimacy in the eyes of the law is having a negative effect on the flow of sizable new capital (especially start-up) into the Bitcoin system from the investment world. 
2) As has been pointed out, 3600+ BTC are being created per day - in order to maintain a price, new fiat funds need to enter at a steady stream. As all the arteries that fed Bitcoin get choked off - entering or leaving the Bitcoin world becomes increasingly hard. You can't spend Bitcoin at your local 7/11, but you can spend US Dollars, Pound Sterling, Euros, Chinese Yuan etc ... you get the idea.
These are arguably the most important reasons for the price reduction and - in my humble opinion - unless there is some definite nod in a positive direction from incumbent governments, I see no reason for Bitcoin price to rebound any time soon (dead kitty bounces exempted).
