So Bitmains hash rate getting hijacked is probably the next major hack?
I imagine a malicious force with that much hash could really cause problems. 
Satoshi sadly didn't see asics coming

lightning network is innovation greater then just scaling, it allows for instant payments (ie buying a cup of coffee), also micro payments.
see "script versioning"

Wont fee's decrease as the btc/fiat ratio favors btc? Electricity must have something to do with it since  miners have to in the end use fiat to pay electricity. Also the fee's spent will be payed out to miners once again entering the steam within 10m~.

Dont forget bitcoin started at 0.01$
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:44:51
must be some damn good peanuts.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:15:46
what makes you think it will dump?
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:11:10
its not true.... how could okcoin, huobi, bitfinex and bitflyer still exist if half the coins are on coinbase? compare their trading volumes, not so different. You would expect to see coinbase have massively more volume if half the coins were there.... Not to mention the massive ammount of coins in cold storage, or off exchange wallets....
And the websites probably went down due to massive increase in use, durring volotility. Not much different from 100,000 people trying to use a site at the same second and a DDOS attack....

wine has its own directory.... the only thing it should be able to encrypt.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:07:07
