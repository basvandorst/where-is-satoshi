Explaining the origins of a stereotype to justify said stereotype. Wow. Talk about missing the point.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:42:42
I know you are but what am I?

[lawlz now he thinks we're the same person](
(edit: pure coincidence, btw. Not my fault he argues like a 10 y/o)
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:36:13
comparing nazis and jews. You're so classy and edgy.
@_date: 2014-05-21 18:03:07




If you don't want contradictory accusations, stop saying contradictory things and making simplistic statements about parts of the world you've never been to. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:52:35
You do know Israel was formed 3 years after WWII, right? Or do you just expect the country to up and disband 66 years later because its existence offends your anti-collectivist sensibilities.
Also, fuck the Nazis' plight. It's very novel that you felt the need to delete and rewrite your comments just to show them sympathy.
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:32:30
for you, possibly. I'm a bigger fan of arguments than wishful thinking and confirmation bias.
@_date: 2014-05-21 18:30:02
Nice flounce, buddy. Enjoy.
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:59:42
Yeah, why the hell do those pesky "Israelis" want self determination anyway? It's not like they suffered from not having it in the past or anything...
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:23:58
Everything Palestinians do to Israelis is defense and everything Israelis do to Palestinians is bloodthirsty racism. Life's really easy when you can work entirely via blanket statements.

From the actual comment you're replying to:


Read what you're replying to, ffs. Also, "indiscriminantly kill arabs around you"? Have you ever even been anywhere near the middle east?
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:16:17


List them.
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:26:20
I'm implying that Jews don't need to prove instances of antisemitism to you, and that the kind of terse denial you posted is the kind of thing minorities go through constantly.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:29:18
It's almost as if an organization formed to fight antisemitism cares specifically about antisemitism. Shocker.
What's next, are you going to complain about the NAACP's fixation on people of color or wonder why the ACLU doesn't fight for the rights of Chinese dissidents?
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:07:29
Why remember all these positions and groups and ideologies when you can divide the world into "good guys" and "bad guys"? Nuance is for suckers.
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:15:15
It must be hard arguing purely in ad hominem when you know absolutely nothing about the person you're arguing with. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:04:38


It's so difficult that Israeli Arabs have equal protection under the law. Man, we can't even do Apartheid right.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:20:49
I'd make a counterargument but that would require an actual argument instead of personal attacks and vague platitudes. It's seriously like you're not even trying. 
So, where did you stay in Israel?
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:26:33
yeah, it was an antisemitic joke and you're a piece of shit for making it. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:39:44


I'm sorry, you were saying?
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:03:17
Anytime, sparky. I hope your fictional journeys to faraway places you are biased against are safe and productive. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:05:14
so much nuance
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:36:58
lol. Racist fucks like you have been saying this about the NAACP for ages. It's fun to see you apply the argument to a different group for once.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:34:17




Yeah, because you're debating in good faith. Wake me up when you come up with an actual argument, or when you've dug up more details of your totes real and not at all made up trip to Israel when you stayed at some Israeli city the name of which you haven't looked up yet.
I mean, if you want to just say "hasbara" over and over again like it's a magic word or like you know what it means that's cool too, but it's getting old.
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:08:34
The most fun thing about antisemitism is the part where gentiles keep insisting we prove it exists. It's an awesome luxury to have when you're not on the receiving end.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:05:59
but bias is easier!
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:43:23
Capital point, ol' sport. Next time you undergo hardship, don't do anything about it because you shouldn't rationalize your behavior on suffering. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:50:02
You wouldn't be the first person to brand someone as a Nazi for disagreeing with them, or the last. The hilarious part is where you think anyone gives a shit. Enjoy your nuance-free arguments, champ. I look forward to seeing them.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:11:00
I'm sure you did, which is why you're describing everything about Israel with the understanding of a 12-year-old with a spotty internet connection. Are you going to keep all your descriptors vague or are you planning on looking up details of your fictional time in Israel on Google until it's painfully obvious you're full of shit? Both options are equally hilarious, so knock yourself out.
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:50:58
As someone with a vested interest in the whole Israel thing, it's really reassuring that you have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:55:29
[you're obviously the expert on jews](
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:02:13
Sometimes different people have similar opinions. Mind blowing stuff, I know.
