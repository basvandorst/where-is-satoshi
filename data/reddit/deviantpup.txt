Thanks for the link! Already have a full website up and running for over 2 years and just need the BitPay system to go forward. Great link/advice for starting up a website though! Thanks

Thanks for the help and links :) Epoch Billing system said they have no integration and when asked if they had any plans the response was : "Dear Customer, I dont believe so. We accept only Visa MasterCard Discover and Paypal"  
Still waiting to hear from CCbill

Bitpay Application has been submitted =D

Sorry I am now just seeing this message. Please do tell me more about your service please. Is it like bitpay but for adult services? From your site it looks like we would send someone to you if they wanted to pay in BTC and then you would give us the confirmation that we can manually add them into the user database? Thanks for reaching out!

then they are idiots..I for one have a minimum of a $1500 production day when shooting a scene for our website and that is because we own our own studio. If we had to rent it would be past the $2000 mark per scene. The more our product is stolen the less we make back and the less scenes we can make in return. So really the more you steal the more the quality will be taken away. If you want us to keep shooting girls like Skin Diamond and Riley Reid;) I recommend you fork over a little buck to your favorite porn site every blue moon...just my 2 cents!

thank you! I was trying to get that point across but he didnt see it that way and believed that in the end Bitcoin was no match for the US Govts. Supercomputers. If they wanted it down it would be down. I still beg to differ and very much appreciate all your good points to help me out :)

I actually help run a Female Domination Website and have been going back and forth about the idea of offering Bitcoin as a payment option. If I did this what would be the best way to make this happen? Would something like bitpay be best? or should I just offer it via email communication? ex: Here is my wallet. Once I receive your BTC i will create a login/password for you?  It wouldn't be very automated of a system but would at least be a starter. Any ideas to get this underway would be awesome!

My roommate had mentioned something about how the world clocks? are in colorado and DC and if they took those down it would cause an internet collapse? I may of missed a point there but it indeed had to do with universal clocks.. Sorry not the geekiest to defend this subject but am trying nonetheless

That was my exact answer but he came back with the US Govt. has the power to shut down the internet if they wanted to..and then i was like shit? well that would be the only way ;)

exactly! it would cause the world to starts to collapse very quickly if whole internet was shut down for an hour. It would take something much bigger the Bitcoin to cause that to happen..i think? :/
