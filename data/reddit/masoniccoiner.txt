If fiat currencies hyperinflate, governments won't want to be paid taxes in that currency.  Just because the circulation  of monetary supply between government and population is currently the status quo, it won't always be. All fiat currencies are slowly inflating towards a value of O.  It encourages people to spend their money before it losses more value, then they have to work more to ensure they have a constant supply of their money that is constantly  leaking value. That's why fiat is an awful store of value. Bitcoin is designed to be the complete opposite. It doesn't need to be used as a fist style currency to succeed.

Of course I'll take pictures! It's a new business I'm setting up. I will be doing balloon tours for tourists over Wicklow and Dublin in Ireland. The balloon will be manufactured in the UK, it will have a huge Bitcoin logo and of course it will be orange. Only problem is finding someone qualified to fly it!

Exactly, and as blockchain is global the incentive needs to be global, de centralized valuable asset. Bitcoin cannot exist without blockchain, and blockchain cannot exist without Bitcoin.

The only thing that seems to be infected with a virus right now is Bitcoin. All of this supposed adoption, yet price is tanking. The only true metric for the current state of Bitcoin is what the market is willing to pay for it, which is 60% less than its ATH.

It's nice to see that somebody has already updated this guys Wikipedia page...
Kjell Halvor Landsverk is author of the book "Håndbok i Facebook" which was published in 2013 in Norwegian. The book is a complete guide on how to use Facebook for businesses, how to create quality content, advertising and contests among other things.[9][10] He is also widely understood to be a real scumbag.
Anything that can be done to legally  harm this guys business interests should be considered. This isn't just an attack on the OP, but on Bitcoin itself and the entire community. We need to find more information about this guy.

Good video but get rid of the music. It's a bit freaky

Many other people such as Jamie Dimon, Warren Buffet etc also think its a scam. Maybe you should join their side, as you already seem to have your mind made up that its a scam. If you want to profit from your judgement, put your money where your mouth is, like the rest of us have, and short it. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:52:02
we all had the option to buy bitcoin at any stage since 2010. If you had bought a pizza or anything else at any time in 2010, you could have decided "no, i wont buy this pizza, i'll buy bitcoin with it instead". The fact that you didnt, means that your opportunity cost is also $80 million or whatever. This pizza day nonsense needs to stop.

People have been saying this for months now. There's always something that's on the horizon, yet when it comes and has no impact on price, there's a new thing on the horizon. Rinse and repeat. All these types of posts serve to do is to prop up the price and try to convince people not to sell.

Haha, don't worry about it. She's extremely intelligent, just has to learn things in a different way. I've edited my OP to clarify I was explaining to an autistic child. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:35:14
Don't mean to knock you down or feel bad, but my niece has autism and when learning new stuff,everything needs to be explained in a relatable way to her. I sort out just made it up to her as I went along, but she took it all in, and I imagine , now understands Bitcoin more than any other child of her age with the same learning difficulties. I'm sure there are simpler ways to explain Bitcoin to a child, but she was helping me wash my car, sponge in hand, as I spoke to her.

Can you please let me know the winning lotto numbers for Ireland tonight? I promise to put all of the money into Bitcoin. In fact the euromillions results for next week would be good too. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:03:21
No offence, but please don't ask them in writing. You want them to accept Bitcoin, not except it. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:57:49
I have them download mycelium or jaxx and once they're set up, I send them crypto, from my phone to theirs. As fees are low right now, I don't mind eating them but when they were very high, I mostly gave them ETH. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:25:52
This is exactly why I'd love to have you as a customer in my car. When you see a Bitcoin transaction actually being doing, it makes so much sense and is so easy. I transfer a fiat value which is then automatically converted to the appropriate amount of BTC. I don't need to do any calculations or anything like that. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:30:52
Fair play for spreading the world. Eventually if they get asked time and time again, more small businesses will begin accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:38:13
Thanks! In fact I'm thinking of getting my car wrapped with a Bitcoin logo, so any donations will help!
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:57:20
In Ireland, people are friendly. Is there something wrong with talking? And if you read my original post, I clearly state that "whenever a conversation develops...." 
I would never force a conversation on anyone, I have no more interest conversing with a stranger than they have with me.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:01:39
There are indeed although I haven't been to any in quite a while. While BTC isn't really being adopted in Dublin just yet, at least not on a wide scale, we definitely have the demographics and infrastructure to transition pretty quickly.
 Dublin is home to the European headquarters of most of the big technology companies, we have a young, tech savvy population and things are already changing at a quick pace. Ireland was one of the fastest countries in the world to switch over to smart phones for example. Hopefully the exit from fiat will happen as quickly! 
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:02:31
There has been passing interest over the last few years, however since the middle of last year, it has become a more prevalent topic of interest. I am part of a younger generation of masons that are pushing for the craft to evolve to today's world, and we want crypto to be a big part of that. Freemasonry is steeped in history and while it might seem outdated to some, we plan on developing a more modern, inclusive fraternity.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:12:26
I used ETH and LTC when fees were too high
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:46:10
Again, I introduce people to Bitcoin as a peer to peer method of value transfer, not as a speculative asset. 
Adoption is the key to growth and real value , speculation and volatility  is what scares people away. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:08:10
Either mycelium or jaxx. While I recommend BTC  to them, some have been asking for ETH instead of BTC.
 Either way, if I can help people to move from fiat, I'm happy to give them any crypto they want.
Reaction is usually one of excitement as it was with most of us when we were newcomers.
 It's important to remember that while a lot of people have heard of Bitcoin and may have a passing interest in it, most don't know how to buy or might feel uncomfortable signing up to an exchange. 
By doing peer to peer exchanges like this, I think it usually gives people more confidence.
Either way, most are really excited and happy to leave my car with a new form of digital money stored on their phone instead of pieces of paper and coins rattling around their pocket.
The fact that it's not an everyday occurrence in a cab for them will hopefully lead to conversations with family and friends about it too.

There is an atm in an electronics shop on upper abbey street as far as I know, or at least there was at one stage.

Yeah definitely, as I live very close to Glasnevin. Send me a PM and we can touch base
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:20:06
Yes I do hodl a small amount for myself. However as I take in surplus fiat when I'm giving out change in crypto, I use that fiat to buy more crypto so I have more to give out, and so on..
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:28:25
Bitcoin isn't an investment, it is a method of transferring value from 1 person to another electronically without any third party involved. That's what Bitcoin is, always has been, and always will be to me. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:26:18
Mycelium or jaxx is what I recommend although there are others. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:18:27
When fees were too high, I gave out ETH and LTC on 1 or 2 occasions. But it's predominantly been Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:12:42
Crypto isn't really accepted anywhere in Dublin yet apart from a crypto cafe on Aungier St, and of course my taxi. Make sure you ask wherever you go though! And if you need a ride when you're here, send me a PM 
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:37:18
Well if they think that, they must not be very clever as they have the option of taking fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:09:17
I never stated that it will be worth more than all the other assets in the world combined. The value of all  of the other assets in the world combined can also trend to infinity.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:23:35
Yes I do, but it's very rare that someone pays me in Bitcoin. Any time you're in a taxi or a shop for that matter, by asking if they accept crypto will raise awareness. eventually if enough people start doing this, more and more small businesses like me will start accepting it. This is how adoption needs to grow, Bitcoin is a payment method and should be used as such. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:35:42
Instead of wishing, just ask! The more places you go into and ask do they accept crypto, the greater the awareness. Eventually,  when enough people start asking, businesses will start accepting it. This is what's needed for crypto to grow organically.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:09:55
To be honest, I sort of lost track after the 500 mark. I'd say I've offered it to approx 550 people, out of those, maybe 10 at the most refused in preference for fiat, so the acceptance rate is higher than 98%.  In saying that, I only suggest it when I can see that the customer has a lot of enthusiasm and is more than likely willing to give it a shot. PM me if you're looking for a crypto cab in Dublin!
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:37:19
I am not "selling" Bitcoin to my customers. I only ever steer the conversation towards Bitcoin if we are talking about the economy etc. If we're talking about football or something, I'm not going to throw Bitcoin into the mix. And I have never come across like I belong "in some weird religion". Out of the last 12 months, for approx 9 of those, Bitcoin was a major story in the media so it's not something out of the ordinary to discuss. When it comes to offering Bitcoin, I have never pushed it on anyone, I simply say that if they like, I can give them their change in Bitcoin to see how it works. This is after we've chatted it about it, and I can usually gauge their interest before I'd suggest it.  Out of more than 500 customers, less than 10 people have said "no, I'd prefer euros instead". 
The whole point of what I'm doing is not to necessarily transact with them in Bitcoin, but to talk them about it, then show them how a transaction works, then they head off with a new app on their phone with this cryptocurrency on it that everyone is talking about, however small an amount. 
i don't see what's wrong with that. 
And just so you know, I'm not a newb.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:38:49
I'm not giving anyone financial advice. As I said in my original post, I introduce people to Bitcoin as a peer to peer method of value transfer, and not as a speculative asset. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:00:13
Yeah, the people asking for ETH had all heard of it before, most of those customers were during the summer of 2017 when Ethereum became almost a buzzword. To be honest, I don't think they even knew what it was was, they just knew it was like Bitcoin and liked saying it because it has a cool sounding name.

Membership has declined over the last decade or so, however as a young mason myself, the craft is changing and adapting to the times we currently live in. Myself and many other young masons are establishing a new order that more reflects society today. As this develops, we expect to see a resurgence in interest over the coming years, and we plan on making crypto a big part of the future of the craft.
