Gotya, appreciate it.

Yeah that sounds terrible. I haven't purchased anything yet with BTC but was wondering how that is going to be handled once people start doing it more often...if they ever do.

You'll get used to it bro. I bought into bitcoin back during the 2013 spike at around $900. Watched it tank but bought a couple more on the way down. Then I spent the next 3 years wondering why the hell I did it. But I really believed in what it was capable of and I told myself going into it that I was in it for the long run. Patience has been key. Around that same time, my good friend bought 5 bitcoin, but approached it the opposite way. He was looking to make a quick buck. He gave up after a few weeks, sold at a loss, and now he is kicking his own ass.
Of course. Nobody really knows how this will all end. Some people just get lucky I suppose.

I want to. I want to hold you so tight.

What the hell is going on.

It was shooting up quick, but then someone put in a big sell wall at 16k.

Thanks for your help!

Take a risk, but don't risk it all. You'll have plenty of time to make more money.

Okay, here's a hypothetical. What if I purchased something with BTC during that time? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:35:04
I did. I hadn't learned to use GDAX yet so I sold from my coinbase wallet. Now I use GDAX and wouldn't go that route.

Thanks!
