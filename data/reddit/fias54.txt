I just went to go use one for the first time. Gave it a $100 bill and $90.84 was deposited in my wallet. 
Ouch!

It’s ok there were a ton of people who bought high and sold low, and they are super salty about it. I’m still up on my investments. I’m not holding crypto for the same reason they were. I’m holding it not because of the value against the dollar, but protection from it if it crashes. 
If the Dollar has issues in the future I will be very happy I held onto my crypto.

Explain...? This guy should feel pressure from all angles when he behaves poorly. He is manipulating the market. Are you suggesting that should be ok? And by him feeling the repercussions of his actions is regulating Cryptocurrencies?  
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:44:48
Not worth the time 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:34:01
There are a lot of wealthy older people who hear CNBC saying to buy Bitcoin. If they use JP for their brokerage firm, they will likely use them to purchase Bitcoin. However, like many I'm very nervous that the big bankers will devise a way to crash Bitcoin.

There is... you should read their white paper and we should talk. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:15:05
Glad to know when a 10 year old is interested in learning this is the response.  You don’t know who your answering. There should be a push to help anyone willing to learn. 
Disappointed... 
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:01:32
I have not. What is that. 
And that reply is a little harsh. Do you have some support that says otherwise? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:49:45
I am asking almost every place I make a purchase if they accept Bitcoin. 
I know the value of what we are doing, and I buy crypto not to just HODL but to spend. Holding for me is part of my support to the community. 
Before I purchase anything I try and find a Crypto retailer. 
Sorry if my slang is off. I'm new to this community and still learning. Any comments are welcomed, I just ask that if I've made any errors you do what you can to pass your knowledge.

This was fucking awesome ��

Good for him!  I mean I would give him healthcare and a good job.  He doesn't have to just work at the store.  But that is pretty cool that he is still working even though he has money.  
On the other hand...  I have tried two times to open my daughter a bank account at my bank.  Each time they continue to tell me we don't have enough forms of ID.  I was able to open her Crypto wallet in seconds and have it funded.  
I am so tired of the banks, politicians, the state, and all the damn control they think they need.  I mean when did a birth certificate not become enough???  
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:46:07
Ok good point. I accept that. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:24:34
Good question and as you see there will still be ways to acquire money for miners. I’m excited to see how the landscape changes as it becomes harder to mine Bitcoin, and eventually what it will look like once there are no more coins to mine. 
My assumption is some of that equipment will be used to mine new currency? 
Thoughts??? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:35:31
I couldn't agree more with the geek speak. My clients and staff understand finance, not geek. And it isn't that they won't learn someday, but it makes it sound unreliable.
I'm ok without splitting the shares because you can buy such a small amount of Bitcoin. This helps fight inflation. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:58:25
Valid point 
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:51:03
I was wondering the same thing. Thank you for the post. Sounds like they are working on a fix.
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:36:43
Isn't that the point? I would consider my self a "normie" but isn't this what everyone has been working for? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:53:31
Well said 
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:24:53
First... let me say that I read the rules of this page and it does not say you should not mention altcoins. I'm not pumping anything, in fact I came here to learn and have a discussion about something I'm interested in. I don't do the geek speak and I may not fully understand the unspoken rules. If some underlying ethics are being broken by a mention of something I have a profound interest in hurts the feelings of a few "purists" then please give a guy a chance when he admittedly says he's new. No need to be a complete jerk and come across mean. I was hoping this community was filled with awesome people, who are willing to teach and learn. But I suppose there are always a few who have egos way too big for their investment account size and feel the need to come across this way... 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:18:06
BAD! I love it. I'm suffering for sure! I check in the middle of the night to see if there is news or a good Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:54:49
Great reply! Thank you for passing on the knowledge. Like people like you my friend.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:38:11
This is true, and you're right I don't yet own a full Bitcoin. I do prefer Ethereum more and that is mostly where I have invested. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:42:52
Well said! I have been asking all establishments and sending emails asking for places to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:21:39
Yo... you don’t have to be an asshole. Someone had a question and asked here. A polite well thought out response would be acceptable. This response is childish and rude. 
Everyone! Don’t be this guy... 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:42:06
This is awesome my friend!!!! Thank you for sharing! 
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:44:33
Wow! What a well written article. She is amazing! 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:22:32
Haha! Someone is an angry elf 
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:49:09
What wallet do you use? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:05:27
What do you mean "weak hands?" 
I have been coaching a lot of people into opening a wallet and usually having them use Coinbase. 
Is there a better wallet? 
I love that people are learning and jumping in. The more the better right? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:57:24
Um... not sure when you invested but isn't ETH up 4000% on the year? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:33:53
Let me also just say that I can see where my first comment wasn't written well. When I said"I can't wait to see what it and what Ethereum can do"' when I said "it" I meant Bitcoin. 
I just want to be clear to the folks in this community that I didn't even know "pumping" was a thing. I actually just learned what FUD was yesterday. 
I see a bunch of people down voted the first comment on my post. Thank you! You are what makes this a great community. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:04:45
Good point here! So question? It seems there is much more manipulation in fiat currency. It's just wildly accepted because it's the big corporations and bankers doing it. If the people planned a run on the bank say November 5th 2019. Understanding not everyone will do it, but if we the people put our banks through a financial test, do you suppose that there would be a large movement toward Bitcoin / Altcoins? 
Because the Dollar is currently experiencing the largest Ponzi scheme ever. If the people planned to withdraw all their money on a known date in the future, people would move their money far in advance from that day and the CEO of JP Chase would probably shit himself, alongside many other big hitters. 
Our government, our bankers, everyone would have to change. But that large amount of people moving from fiat to crypto would help stabilize things correct? 
Just a thought 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:03:58
I'm new to crypto and I did a lot of research before even knowing how or where to buy. Now I can't get enough of it. I'm so excited about what it is and what Ethereum can do. The future looks bright. Well not for the Fed but for the people. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:03:09
I am so happy to see someone in the crypto space standing up to Jamie. This seems to be fact, and of course Jamie is too tied into have a negative outcome, but we can all hope. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:06:24
I use Coinbase. It seems that it is hard to get through the FUD and the haters. So many people in crypto feel they have some superiority because they have been in it a while and love to hate and talk crap. 
I'm not sure if Coinbase is the best but it seems stable and widely used. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:44:59
Get use to it, just don’t stop. The more attention we can bring the better. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:21:39
That it awesome! Welcome!!! 
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:28:02
And as I said before... don’t be this guy. 
Dude... I have a company and staff 50 people, which isn’t Google but pretty good for a small business. I have expectations of people based on where they are in life. But if I ever treat my staff like it appears you treat yours, then let’s just say I’ll get what I deserve. 
You are obviously smarter than all of us. So let us have a discussion and you go be miserable somewhere else. You’re not cool or fun. And that’s what I think we are looking for here. So bye Felicia... 
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:30:20
I love this! Any other bitcoin history trivia? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:44:58
I love the humor. I prefer this so much more than the mud slinging I've seen. We can all disagree on things, but it's important to hear opinions. I'm willing to change my position on things after hearing a valid point. And to use a little humor like this guy is even better. 
Good post my friend! 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:29:41
I'm happy to contribute 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:50:03
I’m not sure this is from him. Would love to know what everyone thinks about this... doesn’t seem legit. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:26:17
 Very well written. Inspiring and honest. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:54:06
So what are your thoughts on Cobinhood?
The name sucks for sure... that much I got. I like the idea, but the dev team I’m unfamiliar with, where they are registered, and the fact they are rushing the product all seem like red flags. 
I’m hoping the no fee product line is something that helps us traders??? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:57:29
They have been great. Not sure why they would shut down an account, but doesn’t seem like they are on business to do that...
