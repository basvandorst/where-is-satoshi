Why build a pool literally few metres from a river?

Can someone explain what the fuck is going on? I just don't understand why btc keeps falling like crazy. I thought that after the fall in january, everything would be stable, and it seemed like it for a while... Why is it now going lower and *lower* and **lower**?
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:42:19
I know it's pure speculation, but I wonder why people value bitcoin almost 4x lower than they did last december.
It's just so weird. 2017 was all hyped about cryptos and now it looks everyone's depressed or something...

Thanks for sharing that! :)

I thought there were some reasonable reasons. I know speculation changes the price a lot, but I kinda don't understand why people would keep selling if btc had bright future. That's why I thought there must be other reasons for the low price. Maybe most investors are really thinking short-term, though...


Yeah, I totally agree. I don't understand why businesses accept bitcoin payments. They sell a coffee for 3 USD and in just a few days it can be 2 USD (or 4 USD), but it is a risk anyway... Not to mention the fees that you have to pay, because you don't wanna wait 5 blocks before you can get your coffee.
Or do businesses have a solution for this? Can you actually send your transaction and immediately get your product?

Well, the biggest fish probably is Satoshi Nakamoto. And I don't know why he/she/they would wanna fuck with people like that. But maybe they do. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:06:39
Can big fish really influence the whole market that much?

Computer Modern! Great choice! I love you!

Yeah, you can argue money laundering itself *isn't* bad. But it *needs to* be a crime for the state to be able to deliver justice.
Helping someone isn't bad. I'm not saying you are as bad as a murderer if you help him hide in your home. But you obstruct justice. And the state has to deal with that. And probably the only way is to make obstruction of justice illegal.
But also, you could argue that it is bad. Because if you knew and had the choice not to help them, then helping them leads to more injustice.
For example: if you willingly help a serial killer hide in your home (I'm not discussing cases where you didn't have the choice - for example blackmail), then you allowed more innocent people to die. And that makes you a bad person.
TL;DR Money laundering may not be bad, but it *needs to* be illegal, or else justice couldn't be delivered. It's quite obvious.

It's obvious why money laundering is a crime. It would be weird if hiding criminal behaviour wasn't a crime. It would make bringing criminals to justice impossible. If you want the state to work properly and defend its citizens' rights, then you need to punish not only criminals, but also people that obstruct justice. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:32:35
Your reasoning is wrong. "Criminal" is just a label. State has to punish behaviour that violates other people's rights.
You are saying that it creates criminals, which is correct. But you don't realise that "criminal" is just a label. If you choose not to label murder as "crime", then there will be fewer criminals, but innocent people are going to die.
See my other comment for reasoning why money laundering *needs to* be a crime. It's quite obvious... 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:58:01
This is a [false cause fallacy]( You are the one confusing chickens with eggs. I'm not saying money laundering should be illegal because other money launders will use it to hide their activity.
I'm saying: there are things that are bad. We choose to label them "crime". Whatever. For the sake of this argument I won't even need to use the word "crime" anymore
People have their rights. The state is there to protect their rights. For example the right to life. There are people who don't give a fuck. And they kill others. The state wants to arrest them, in order to stop other innocent people from dying. But the state can't do that because there are immoral people who help the killers hide. How? For example by money laundering! That's why it should be illegal. That's the point.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:04:12
Yeah, but the point is they are discouraged from doing so by the threat of losing money... Bitcoin is traded so high because everyone wants it, if it were to turn into an "oligopoly", then nobody would want bitcoin and it would lose its value.
A small group of people can, in theory, take over the entire system, but they won't, because they have no reason to do it, other than doing the most harm to everybody, including themselves...
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:51:34
TBH, the fees are crippling bitcoin already...
You just can't buy a coffee with bitcoin, because either you pay much more, or you have to wait for the transaction to arrive, which could take long. [Sauce.](
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:43:29
Dollars are divisible as well. I really don't understand why they'd think that. Also, if indivisible, Bitcoin would be useless as a currency. No one wants to buy lunch for 2800 USD.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:26:40
How would it be technically possible, though? You can't have infinite space to represent as big (or as small) numbers as you wish.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:25:06


I mean, in any but paper application, there are floors. It is literally impossible to store any number in computer memory. What I tried to imply is that even when using physical objets for storing numbers - might be certain count of atoms, lengths of objects, properties of field, etc., we can't go infinitely small.
Also, I thank you a lot for explaining so thoroughly. My line of thinking was mostly theoretical and I didn't bother about the real blockchain. But I find it iteresting that there is a (artificially) specified lower bound and that actually changing it would require a hard fork. :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:39:40
Yeah, that's true. If I understand correctly, neither Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible. (Or at least I see an obvious technological issue, since there are numbers too small to be written into a computer. But we might in theory create new data types to be able to hold smaller numbers than that.)
Nothing really can be infinitely divisible, if we consider that the world is made of atoms and that even energy is indivisible, since it is quantized.
But, of course, we could in theory use a virtual currency and write all transactions on a paper, then we could actually achieve as small transactions as we want to.

What the hell is this logic? Why aren't bankers arrested for selling foreign currency, then? And it's worse, because with every exchange, the banks fuck with you.
