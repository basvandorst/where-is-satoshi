I agree with you, no matter how many forks we go through, Bitcoin is always Bitcoin. There's no reason to default to "BCH is trash", because IMO all forks are just opportunities for something new to be tried out, in this case the doubling of blocksize, in other cases, a POS system, Masternodes, no mining at all, etc. It's all just ways to introduce new things into the field, and trying to kill it before it starts is a surefire way to have a bad situation in which BTC is the only coin, and the devs get complacent with the lack of any competition.

No issues here, I and many others use Chase with both Coinbase and Gemini. Needless FUD spreading.

He's most likely referring to the DAO attack where many millions of ETH were stolen, so they hard-forked to undo the theft. It can be argued whether it was wrong or right, but either way it fundamentally goes against the un-changable ledger.

This is correct, if you spend on the B2X chain, it does not effect the BTC chain, ~~since they have now added replay protection.~~
Edit: I was wrong, they have not added replay protection.

Connect your Trezor, open wallet.trezor.io, click the settings button right above your accounts list, and hit "homescreen" on the top bar.

That's what he means, he's here in Bitcoin because of the dramatic inflation possibilities of fiat (plus more reasons of course).
