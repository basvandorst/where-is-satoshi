Here's a few:

They're being honest, and it's not all bad. Investors see numbers like that and look further for potential to climb again. It can be high, it is currently low, therefore opportunity may exist.

~~Not to mention, it was structured like MLM from the get-go (if you dig deep enough into the reward system). The advertising and literature were misleading. They were just asking for someone to throw the book at them.~~
edit: Not ripple, rippln. Nevermind.

... and in other news, this happened to make headlines in the news.

It may also be a legal nightmare. For instance, cavirtex.com can only accept Canadian customers in order to stay within the money-handling regulations they've aligned with (and even advocated for).
There might be a way for them to branch out to do the same in other countries, but I for one am pleased that they're focused on doing it right and by the book within their home country. Plus their debit cards look awesome in matte black.

If you otherwise have good credit, you can try 
It's more of a micro-lending platform, and reputation is everything, but if you have a good plan it could mean a fresh start, even if it means selling cans of pop on the beach.

How about in a 2 year window?

No, that assessment was from my own reading of the startmyripple.com literature some time ago. I didn't refer enough friends to earn the right to download the literature, but I managed to find it anyhow (*wink*). Sadly I've misplaced it since then. Don't worry, I'm sure I sent a copy to the SEC.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:53:22
That's also easy to do.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:30:46
Agreed. I'd like to build something decentralized. First, I'll need a big loan... :P
The challenge lies in making something decentralized that has appeal outside of the crypto-community. I've got some rough ideas there.

Returns for high credit-rated borrowers is net positive, and you can choose btc or usd indexed loans. It's cool.

One upvote for Ƀ

GAW wrecked mining for me.. funds now camping out at btcjam. Diversified Micro-loans yield better than doing nothing at least.

...and over a two year span, that can hardly be written off as a market fluctuation. So can we declare the bubble dead and move on up yet, or do you think we're still rather frothy at $300?
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:55:55
You're right, many otherwise uninterested investors will gloss over it, for the time being, and next year it may read quite differently.
However, they don't have to look much further back to see the big picture, the growth pattern that moves in orders of magnitude. When they see the opportunity that others may have passed up due to that YTD loss, they might just realize that right now they have an edge on the post-bubble market. A wise investor will "Look well into a matter" and decide for themselves.

That's the one. Missed the memo. Thanks :D

I'd like to introduce you to a decentralized payment platform that charges no fees to vendors, and has no chargebacks, ever.
That platform is called Bitcoin.
You may know Bitcoin as a headline-making online currency, but that doesn't matter to you and here's why:
*Through a variety of payment processors, you can receive dollar-for-dollar payments in your bank, usually the same day. You can keep your prices listed in your usual currency as well.*
Point-of-Sale systems for Bitcoin are booming in metro areas. Why? Because millions of potential customers from around the world are eager to deal with businesses that accept Bitcoin payments, online or on the street. You have the opportunity to be an industry leader, and join the tens of thousands of businesses that have decided to accept Bitcoin payments.
For an overview of Bitcoin technology, please visit weusecoins.com and see some of the merchant tools suggested.
To skip to the part where you receive dollar-for-dollar payments, please visit bitpay.com

You could maybe drop a sentence here or there depending on the type of business you're targeting, but if you take out too much, it only looks like a lack of effort.

Technically, the top color is 1 degree hue off, and the line is 1px to the right and 1px thicker. Too weird.

Yes and no.. Actually this one is unique enough to point out all the ways that bitcoinwisdom's logo is *not* unique.
[Here they are super-imposed.]( You can tell some work was done, but the match is too precise not to be a direct knock-off.

I know, right? I almost didn't post it, thinking "someone must have noticed this before."
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:49:51
sweet. my wallet say thank you :)

Mmmm. Burrito. Soooo. Hungry.

It's kind of like [this](

They're basically saying take it and go. Can't hurt to oblige them. For what it's worth, these guys did all they could to be accountable, working with politicians instead of in spite of them. They have been leaders in terms of integrity, and Bitcoin could use more like that.
