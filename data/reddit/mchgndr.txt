Why is it undervalued?
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:45:01
How bout that prediction ol’ buddy ol’ pal?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:19:40
Wow hello future man please give me more of your infinite wisdom. Such smart, very intelligent
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:26:24
Same here kind of. 17,500...but still. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:30
We can’t keep up, so there’s no point in even trying
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:23:42
Seriously, holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:18
Lol, if you bought litecoin an hour ago you already up 30%. This world is weird
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:46
It’ll be big, but not as big as when it was comparable to a penny stock. Expect a 50% drop, not 90%. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:28:17
Don’t sell. It’ll keep going and leave you in the dust. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:38:22
I bet it’ll get to 15k or so (which is where I’m selling) then crash down to 5-8k (which is where I’ll get back in)
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:17
$15k? Good one. By the time you finish making your meme it’ll be at 16k. I’m preparing my collection of 20k memes...gotta keep with the times man.

I have a credit card and debit card linked up, btw.

What happened to bitcoin cash?? Coinbase isn’t even displaying it at all now hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:43
Can some explain to me why we hate Bitcoin Cash so much? After reading about it, it seems like a good thing. But everyone here seems to hate it. ELI5?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:27
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:35
Yup. Always remember: if you made a gain of any amount, whether it was 10% or 1000%...you did not lose. There will always be a better time to buy, a better time to sell, a missed opportunity. But if you made money, you can never truly be upset with yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:14:43
Yeah, I used to get excited watching stocks in my 401k jump 2 or 3%. Now if I’m not making 15% in a day, it’s like, what’s even the point? This whole thing is going to have bigger psychological impact on us than most people are accounting for. I just hope nobody nearing retirement is chasing volatility the way my 25 year-old ass is....
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:08
Shit for real? Sources? I’m interested (and terribly sad)
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:35
All I really see on Twitter is him promoting his live speaking events

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:34
So a buy wall means probably a price surge to come?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:29:27
Nope, US
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:17
Does Coinbase do limit orders? I don’t remember seeing the option
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:57
Lol my timing is impeccable. Bought another $400 worth when it was right at 18k, then refresh and it’s at 17k. Alllllrighty then. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:21:26
It’s never going to hit 50k. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:42:49
Total noob here, can you explain what a buy wall is?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:45:50
Wow this is like Dec 2017 all over again. Yet somehow it’s not in the news at all this time
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:35
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:01:13
Fuck, that’s kind of sobering...
