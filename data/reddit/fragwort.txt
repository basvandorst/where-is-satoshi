The immutability and censorship resistant nature of bitcoin both depend on decentralization. For example when a single mining pool controls too much hashpower, they could perform what's referred to as a 51% attack. But as long as miners are decentralized, their work keeps eachother honest.

Well strictly speaking, there is every node's downloaded copy of the blockchain, and then there is the big 'B' Blockchain, which is what we all agree is the 'correct' one. The Blockchain is not stored in any one place, but exists conceptually as an agreement between miners and full nodes.

Honestly, it's not really surprising. Hydro in Ontario and Quebec is so expensive, partly due to the fact that there's not enough users to pay for production and the excess has to be sold out of province at a loss. The average household would actually benefit from miners moving in an shouldering the costs of energy production. Any budding bitcoin miners would have been already been thinking about this for a few years, so there's probably already a lineup.

There is probably no assurance, until very large companies accept it, or until governments accept Bitcoin for their taxes. But how widely do you need it to be accepted? What is your use case for it?
Bitcoin has many advantages over fiat currency, including censor ship resistance, decentralization, and protections against counterfeiting. That's assurance enough for me.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:34:27
Theoretically, yes. Although almost all mining these days are done by dedicated ASICS and not desktop PCs, if all miners suddenly shut down at once except for one guy with a Linux PC in his server closet, after enough time the difficulty would adjust so that one guy with his PC would start mining blocks every 10 minutes.
This is also why the bitcoin blockchain is considered much more secure than any other coin's blockchain, because there are so many miners contributing their hashrate, and the difficulty is so high.

@_date: 2018-01-11 18:40:37
Yep, on any exchange that allows margin trading.
Or just take out a loan, buy over a period of time, sell all at once on one or two exchanges during a slow day, then pay back your loan before interest accrues too much. If you dumped at market price, other sellers may go lower to sell faster. If supply outstrips demands, it results in a lower price. When the price is lower, you can then buy cheap bitcoin before the next market correction, or pump your own scammy altcoin to entice BTC sellers to switch to yours, raising the price of your altcoin before you also dump that.
Market manipulation 101.

While I agree with the sentiment, at the end of the day you're still trusting that exchange with bitcoins that YOU put in their wallet. I'm not anti-regulation, but the regulations you're speaking of are more like a safety blanket than real protections.

Don't forget Bitfinex. They "solved" it by giving account holders a haircut and releasing their own BFX tokens which they promised to buy back with BTC at 1:1.
Since a lot of people didn't have faith that Bitfinex would make good on that promise, the BFX tokens were being traded for less than 0.3 BTC at one point. Bitfinex did eventually pay back BFX holders in stages, but nobody's been able to prove for sure that Bitfinex didn't anonymously buy back any BFX for less than 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:01:32


Pretty much. Off-chain transactions aren't a particular type of transaction, they're just a transaction that is not recorded on the blockchain. Like if I traded you a paper wallet with 1 BTC for your car. (which is bad opsec by the way, but it's a simple example).


Yeah, it could handle 8x the transactions, as well as 8x the tx spam. Segwit as an alternative scaling solution uses space more efficiently, but it's still relatively new and to take full advantage of it more users and companies need to move to segwit wallets. They'll be less pressured to do so if they could just take up more space on the blockchain instead.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:50:16

A few decent exchanges have already been mentioned. But I just want to point out, they want to pay you in crypto because they are trying to encourage more use of crypto. Rather than convert it all to fiat cash by trading on an exchange, see if any of your employees or suppliers are willing to accept Bitcoin in place of their regular wages/invoice payments, which will help minimize fees from exchanges that take a cut of your bitcoin trade.

It can be a little disheartening at times, but it's a double edged sword; the blockchain and bitcoin depend on people acting in their own self interest.

People will look for reasons why, everyone pushing their own agenda will have their own explanation. I think the easy answer is the simplest one: newbies started buying in due to FOMO, stuff happened that they didn't fully understand, FUD started getting spread around mostly by the same people trying to short-sell, and then newbies started panic selling.
Some newbies will sell out at a loss, and others will learn from their mistakes and start posting memes the next time it happens.

I've watched videos and talks by RMS, Simon Phipps, Eben Moglen, Greg Kroah-Hartman, and other old school open source advocates.
Bcash doesn't exist because someone's love of technology or because someone had an itch that needed to be scratched. Bcash is nothing short of a parasite that only exists to confuse new users of Bitcoin. Ver keeps on using the same trick to try and take over Bitcoin, with Bclassic, Bunlimited, and now Bcash. And he's still got lots of money so he's probably going to keep in finding suckers to buy his next scam coin too. So of course his developers are going to be toxic as fuck.
When there comes a time that we need a legitimate fork, the existence of these scamcoin forks will actually prevent people from switching over because it will turn it into a "Boy who cried Wolf" type of situation.

You're talking about the social impact. Deflationary currency means that your savings can't be devalued through inflation.


Yep, which is true no matter what is considered illegal in your country.


The 'superrich' don't need bitcoin to evade taxes, they have a lot of other means, but if they did then they might have to do more business in BTC rather than fiat.
Bitcoin has a load of potential other than just being a currency or a store of value. In the days before Satoshi's disappearance, there was talk of micropayments and microloans which could help people in third world countries, also a decentralized and uncensorable alternative to the DNS system, and like with ethereum and other crypto Bitcoin can eventually develop it's own smart contract systems which facilitates transactions between two parties without a third party mediator. There are also lots of other applications such as Proof of Existence and systems like counterparty that allow token trading on top of the bitcoin blockchain. We are still in the early days of bitcoin, and as the scaling issue gets solved we'll see the real power of bitcoin reveal itself.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:09:38
Only a certain number of Bitcoin is mined per block, and if you look on block explorers then you will see that there are no wallet addresses where the outputs are greater than the inputs (except for those address associated with a mining reward). Barring some hardfork specifically allowing it, you will never see more than 21 mil coins on-chain.
Off-chain however, on your accounts for exchanges and other institutions, they could fake the numbers. They would always run the risk of getting found out though by an auditor ot by some bored internet detectives checking them out with a block explorer.
This isn't a Bitcoin problem, this is a trusting other people problem.

It depends on the forked nodes. If the transaction is in the mempool of a forked node when the fork occurs, and if it's a valid transaction under the new fork's rules, then it will happen on both blockchains. Otherwise, it will only happen on the original chain. I imagine some forked coins would prefer to avoid this by having a cleared mempool at the time of the fork, but it's not a requirement.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:51:57

Yep, there are paper wallet generators that allow anyone to create and print wallet address and private key pairs, as well as the QR codes for easy scanning. 
The recommended method involves having a clean computer environment, which can be achieved by booting a computer with a Linux live session on DVD or USB, using a trusted generator downloaded onto a USB stick, and printing to a non-WiFi printer. Then you close the live session, make sure any cached files are deleted from the computer and USB stick, and turn   power cycling the printer to make sure the keys aren't cached after printing.
This might sound like tinfoil hat levels of opsec, but it's necessary especially since Intel processors do phone home when connected to a network and you're not always in control of the information they send out.

it's obvious to most that bitcoin needs an off chain scaling solution. The ironic thing is that BCH crowd, the people who tout the virtues and performance of the BCH blockchain, they don't seem to realize that BCH is itself an off chain scaling solution, separate from the bitcoin blockchain.
Naysayers are mostly just afraid that when LN is active, it will be the only second layer scaling solution, which is untrue and unenforceable. It is conceivable that the devs in charge of LN will be able to manipulate the money system, but there won't ever be anything preventing another second layer alternative from popping up and working alongside LN. The centralization issue surrounding LN is a made up bogey man.

The tin foil hat way to do paper wallets is to have an air-gapped computer with a trustworthy Linux live session (like Tails or another Linux distro booted from DVD or USB), install the trusted script or program to generate keys and optionally their respective QR code images, and have it directly connected to a printer.
The problem with doing that on iOS is to do that offline, you'd need an air-gapped network with another computer and printer or a network printer and router; and even then after printing you'll need a surefire way that all traces of the keys are removed from the iDevice (as well as the printer's cache) before it goes back online unless it's reformatted every time the app is used. Or suppose it never goes back online, and we make it permanently air-gapped, then you don't even need to print the keys except as a backup. But who would buy an iPhone just to use as an offline wallet when trezors or ledger s nanos exist?
So let's think outside the box: how can we make a cold storage wallet on iOS without printing or connecting to any other device? There's no SD card option, the only removable medium on iPhones and iPads are the SIM cards, which are relatively cheap and are reusable. But even if you stored the keys as contacts on a SIM card, you want a surefire way to make sure all traces of the keys are removed from the iDevice before it goes back on the network. You do that, then people can use SIM cards as cold storage wallets all offline.

Simply put, the Blockchain is like a big file that contains the transaction history of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core is the program that contains the set of rules to verify that a node's copy of the blockchain is valid, whether that node is a miner or a full node.
Since Bitcoin Core is open source, any other clients or wallet software can also contain the same set of rules. This is why many clients and wallets exist, many of which are compatible with bitcoin.
Clients and wallets can also include a modified version of the rules, which is how alts like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum are created; since the rules are different, it creates a different type of blockchain that is not compatible with Bitcoin's blockchain. When the code gets forked, the blockchain is also forked, like with bcash, bitcoin gold, and other forks which have a blockchain that starts out identical to Bitcoin's but changes on the day of the fork.

TrueCrypt is old and mostly abandoned. Many people consider it to be potentially compromised ever since the Dev team intentionally crippled it in it's final release versions before completely abandoning it. IIRC, the final versions of TrueCrypt left out the ability to create new encrypted volumes, and would only decrypt.
There is the VeraCrypt project that picked up where TrueCrypt left off, but many people consider the code to be tainted, since we can only speculate on why TrueCrypt was dropped so abruptly, and it's heavily implied that government agents infiltrated or threatened legal action against the Dev team, who operated anonymously.
