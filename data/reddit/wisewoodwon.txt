Thanks for your reply I don't understand the security of bitcoin very well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:06:27
Can't they find them?  Did they hack and immediately cash the bitcoin?  And if they didn't cash it out can't they be found?  I thought a specific bitcoin belongs to a specific blockchain, and therefore can be identified and given back to its original owner.

So the best security is a memory stick separate from your computer.  But then they can hack your computer when you put in the memory stick?

Great post! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:56:02
I still don't fully understand it, but thank you.

We are going to start accepting Bitcoin today,  moving to other currencies if it doesn't go well.

It is a great product!  we straightlined 15,000 board feet in subzero conditions.  Just make sure your outlet has the power.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:36:48
We launched tonight with no success.  Bitcoin folks do not seem to like picture frames from the Wild West.

We let it lapse because no Architects or contractors cared to see it. We are a resource building materials supplier(old barnwood).  Now we are trying a new product  online. 
 
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:56:12
Would you please list us also?  We are a green building materials company which posted a while back.     This was the post.      It was the least popular -our company is now accepting bitcoin- post I have ever seen
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:03:00
Thank you,  I appreciate the advice.

I read it a while ago,  I think it was this,  
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:20:16
Ok.  well clearly we have different skill sets.  May I ask you questions regarding accepting bitcoin as a merchant?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:43:10
What is WP?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:33:24
I don't know.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:22:58
Oh.  I don't know how to do that. I have looked into making a website again,  but haven't found bitcoin friendly websites.  You are saying don't use bitpay?  is that correct?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:36:30
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:24:55
Thank you.

I have a small business with no website (no computer skills)  Is there a way to setup a system(or something similar) bitpay through my facebook small business site?
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:43:45
I have a small business I would like to offer a bitcoin payment method(I have no current online payment system).   But I have NO computer skills.    Don't you have to have a TON of computer expertise and cryptography knowledge to protect yourself from getting hacked/stolen from?  
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:31:47
I love her!  she is awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:31:33
I got the same thing. 
 We don't have a stance.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:42:11
THank you Rassah.
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:58:51

@_date: 2013-05-20 20:36:47
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:22:52
that is fast.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:15:05
How much have you sold with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:16:35
I just began the process of putting up some of our products, and the customer service so far has been excellent.
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:35:19
Has accepting bitcoin increased sales for this store?
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:25:10
Thank you.  I don't know what I am looking for.
