hi... not sure you were replying to my post, but I didn't mention stocks...

thing is, for bitcoin to reach tipping point where it spread virally, it has to be cheaper to buy with btc than fiat... maybe significantly.
The promise of bitcoin is it's cheaper to pay that way, lower overhead. 
  Otherwise buyers will prefer to hoard btc instead of spend it.
Business has to recognize this and offer discounts, plus use a good exchange rate like mtgox instead of coinbase pricing.

the answer to this IMO is rather simple - we already have dozens, hundreds of competing alt-coins... and it's very easy to buy them with bitcoin, at much lower commission than exchanging for fiat, typically.   So, if one of these altcoins - say, darkcoin - really gets traction for some new innovation, it's trivial to preserve one's bitcoin investment by buying the new currency with bitcoin, and even profit if you realize the advantage sooner.  
There would only be a small number of coins which come into wide enough use, because of vast competition and the overhead resistance of getting vendors to accept the new coin.. people won't invest seriously in altcoins which lack sufficiently diverse mining support, so it's unlikely that significant amounts of bitcoin value dilution would occur across the many altcoins.  
a similar question applies to the transition from pre-paper currencies to paper ones: it's a competitive market where the more useful technology wins out.  initially there was resistance to the notion of paper currency - distrust of banks, etc.  --  but eventually people traded in their gold for "faith-based" paper.
Some still hang on to their gold.
If bitcoin offers enough advantages over fiat, people will trade their fiat for bitcoin ... and if future coins offer advantages over bitcoin... you see how it goes.

yes, to below-market - hard to be precise about price.
I almost signed up to fairly until i saw the miniscule bet sizes...
why would bidders who already have bitcoin, who can cooperate, and who can buy it off-exchange for market rates - pay a premium to get more?  I think this will be viewed as a chance to acquire at good price - just like other assets auctioned by USM.

6am to 6pm, 4 more hours to go

actually, the bids submitted were frozen as of noon today, when market prices were around 565.  if in syndicate, you're paying 5% so a par market bid would be around $543.  
Bids are not all for one price, you can submit a tier.    Assuming a dutch auction, seller will continue to fill bids, highest to lowest, to obtain maxium yield.
Why would any buyer bid above market when it's likely they will get lower fills if other also participants avoid bidding high?  
Finally, with bidder list leaked, it's quite possible that bidders would communicate and collude on a strategy.  Why would they agree to bid high if, by refraining, they could get coins for a steal?

sos, true enough, and that applies to fiat currency as well. 
For bitcoin, there's a range of tradeoffs for storage, and coinbase/vault seemed to be one of the best choices.  
Actually, I lost a bunch of bitcoin trying to use an early coinbase implementation of 'paper wallet'  where the browser would crash before you could save page or write down the key :-)
In this instance, it's the USD balance that was frozen but unable to convert to btc to transfer - negligible bitcoin stored there.

shorting is a mechanism prevalent in equity and many other markets globally -- like derivatives, it serves a purpose - I'm not arguing the morality of it or whatever.  In other markets, there's always a way to cover.  And nobody's talking about naked shorting,I'm not sure how that would even be possible with bitcoins without theft.

There wasn't much of a ToS when I signed up, the website barely worked.   But the question is more general, not specifically about me - if coinbase and others are forced to act by AML regulations, those same regulations expose traders to potentially unlimited risk, especially if their reasons are kept stazi-like secret with no recourse - is that a scenario even anticipated by the folks who write these regs?    The sums involved could be huge if btc goes way up... I guess the lender of the coins would be able to sell at some point - if they could get the coins back - but whom would they sue? 
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:50:14
The issues I'm raising I think go beyond coinbase, although certainly I hope I'm doing others a service by highlighting some risks I haven't seen discussed, and the bullying way the company treats its loyal/profitable/early customers: freezing bitcoin and $USD without court order, not addressing problems they create (like how about at least a reply saying future btc payments would be forwarded), not notifying someone that they've been booted (I don't even know how long ago this happened, there was not even an email about it) , not supplying a way to get tax info once account is closed, not allowing users time to react even to oblige their requests.   
The broader question is whether the way all these companies are complying with the new regulations has created large systemic risks not present in the current equities infrastructure.

Also, on reading more, a liability disclaimer doesn't seem to protect a company if they act illegally 
@_date: 2015-10-16 02:21:49
Public companies (banks) can do that too.   But what if the reasons they do so are based on false - or falsified information?  Presumably all other providers have access to whatever data coinbase has, so we're saying this regulation gives the financial institutions impunity to damage anyone's financial functioning and reputation.  By analogy, if something destroys my credit rating, I can at least see what happened and try to repair it - if someone has stolen my identity, I can go after them.  Here, it's like you're judged guilty of a crime and punished without being accused... what do people do in this case to recover?
@_date: 2013-10-06 07:02:14
I don't think the main concern is the banks, it's that the $5M in USD currently locked up by the lawsuits is unavailable for refunds or operations.   If the feds succeed in choking mtgox and they become insolvent, there will be no $ to be refunded.  
So it's quite important to get as much info on the situation as a possible.  If we see multiple credible reports of refunds actually happening, that tends to support the claims MtGox is making about manual processing causing the delay...

IT would really help if the order display included some kind of (anonymous) user number, so we could see if one person is doing all the selling or buying, or if it's many, and know the distribution pattern.... how about it?
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:50:06
the odd thing about this initial email was that it said 'please contact your credit union' with no link or info describing which credit union!

Is this session still active?  I entered 3 questions in the past 90 minutes and got replies to none...?  for how long will you be answering??
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:23:16
 how about limiting the streaming output so instead of updating for every tiny trade it batches the data, requiring many fewer JSON updates, reducing server load and bandwidth...  keeping pages like this  updating at a 10-minute lag is kind of useless... 
how about making your own orderbook display and fixing the GUI so there's a clear difference between BUY and SELL buttons, and the price field isn't updated while you try to type into it??
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:27:06
I would like to see them publish the pending verfication queue as a way of being transparent about current demand or lack thereof
@_date: 2013-10-06 18:17:36
I too would like to see some anonymized verification of this
as nobody else is confirming any withdrawals from mtgox!

I submitted my info for IAFCU, waited at least a week, then got an email saying a password reset had been requested.... which I didn't request.  I replied saying I hadn't requested a password change, and got confused email back from Jordan Modell.
Then I realized this IACU was related to bitfloor...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:13:04
Can you give us some insight into the incoming registration queue
you stated 20k new signups per day, and a friend was told he is 15k in line for verification.... some percent of these new buyers will chicken out, but others will view it as opportunity.    
IF you could update those stats it would help, and maybe publish them openly ongoing basis, it would give everyone insight to the pending demand...
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:34:25
yeah they do and they are the 10th largest (in terms of alexa ranking) site to accept it
