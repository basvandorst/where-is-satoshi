Store credits are a good way to encourage repeat customers.
Also it keeps the merchant cashflow rich and avoids micro-transactions.
For high margin business it should be possible to give a 5% discount. 2.5% from the bitcoin cost saving and 2.5% by supplying the reward product at cost price.

I'm not really thinking of merchants. I'm thinking about people with a large amount of their wealth in Bitcoin. So not looking at the cost of the individual transaction but instead the total cost of the event. As an example, I could buy a put option today and protect my Bitcoin assets for the duration of the option. Would it be realistic for any fund to sell a put option to me that would pay out in a basket of alternative assets and where the option is only valid after a double spend event?

Yes this is a big plus for Bitcoin. 
No racing to cancel stolen cards, no hanging around for replacement cards/pins to arrive in the mail. And if it happens when your abroad it a complete nightmare. You can insure your phone you can't insure your wallet.

Just a near neighbor over in Ireland. Don't worry if you're struggling with bitcoin it is very new and takes a few months to get ones head around.
I had a quick look at the RNLI address and they receive about £5 a day in bitcoin, so not a huge amount but it all counts.
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:06:09
Removes the risk of experts being spuriously sued if thier advise is inaccurate. This is one of the reasons safety advise today is so poor today. Those issuing the advise today have to take extreme positions so to avoid being sued, often this amount to tell all people not to do a given activity, no matter the level of risk.
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:07:30
A bitcoin replacement for the franking machine/stamps. Using multsig the postal service would have one key and the second key would be printed instead of the stamp.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:28:21
You would only get a crowd based estimate of the risk.
If you get back alive you get your deposit back and everybody goes home Happy.
Access to medical records is useful. The more information you give me more likely your risk assessment will be correct.
Let me give you an example of how this might work. Say I want to do some Sea  swimming on holidays but I do not know the area. So I enter my plan on the website and get a rating.
If you are the expert you would know more about the area and the risks, and you might rate my plan as having a 100:1 chance of resulting in a fatality.
I could still ignore your advice but the next visitor would see my plan and also see I never collected my deposit.
Over time I would hope the site would become an effective means of collecting data, assessing risks and an aid to safety.
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:25:23
Because your risk profile is individual to you, where as today safety advise is a blanket statement which tries to cover everybody from inexperienced novice to highly trained professional.

Sites like up-down and satoshi dice have had provable fairness for years. The crowd funding aspect is not new. The use of what is essentially an altcoin leaves them open to criticism, both fair and unfair. 
I have "invested" a small amount of bitcoin so I will be watching to see how it turns out.

Bitcoin is auditable and potentially refundable.
Bitcoin can be "almost" peer to peer, where coupons include another party, eg printing, distribution, accounting, banking etc
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:48:24
Yes, but everybody gets a better risk assessment so it is a win-win use case.
It is better than today's widely ignored blanket "safety" advice.
@_date: 2016-01-02 21:36:05

I don't really want to get side tracked on the nature of charity.
I am not a fan of the idea of the social contract as it has inherently negative freedom. But until something better is invented that is what I/we will have to work with.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:13:23
Compare it to a conversation one might have in a club where a novice might ask a more experienced climber's opinion.
There is no downside for the "expert" in using this website and there is a chance of "winning" some bitcoin by giving accurate advice.
I am looking at this as an aid to safety. One of the limiting factors today is a lack of information. This site would encourage people to plan their activity and if something unfortunate happens at least we would know what they were trying to do.
If people change thier mind after seeing their assessment then that is also a good thing. If I visited a website and saw an activity profile like the one I had I in mind and someone had died I would probably change my plan.

No problem, I understand your point of view. The homeless person is free to not use the donation. In this case the donation could be returned to the donner.
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:18:33
I can't see this working for purchases under about 10k usd and even at that you have to assume an awful lot of risk.
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:56:18

Reggie Middleton project could be used. The players create 2 transactions with a 2 of 3 and depending on the out come the house signs 1 transaction. This has benefit that the house never holds the player's funds. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:51:31
Great question
Bitcoin can be independently audited by anybody (assuming they have the right know how). Where I live there have been some scandals about miss use of donations.
Potential unused funds could automatically be returned to the donner is not used after say 1yr.
If the donation can be done via bitcoin then people's privacy/bank details can be protected. Personally I have gotten a small mountain of mail from charities after donating. This is a waste of paper and resources.
@_date: 2016-01-02 18:00:50
To be realistic the shelter etc would have to hold a wallet the homeless person would just tap an nfc card to sign the transaction. 
Really its a type of 2 factor auth and may not even need a multisig. 
Bitcoin is under the hood so no need to explain/understand to get things working.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:17:59
mortgages give you your future earning up front. governments allow this to happen as they trust banks and feel it has a positive effect on the economy. banks provide a risk assessment and get paid for it.
I could see this being replaced by software but ultimately the government must trust the software to assess the risk. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:35:17

I 100% agree, the halfing disillusionment = capitulation. I wouldn't be suprized if the usd price half's.

I would let the video run with ads but have an option to up grade with bitcoin. 
I paid with bitcoin and it worked seamlessly, very neat!

Two ideas (I'm drunk so bare with me)
I remember reading a trading book and they analsys the difference  between  winning and loosing in a give year (over decades), and it came down to 4 days! If you were in the market on those days you beat the market and if you weren't you lost money.
2) this rally is bullshit until we see an ATH because even dead cats bounce, so please don't pump it with friends or family.

Call me a cynic but there is exactly 1 bitcoin node listed for the entire country of Kenya.
But from 0 to 1 is 10000000%+ growth!

Yes, bitcoin is my mid life crisis,
I do remember when the internet was just a load of static pages like a giant really expensive phonebook.

Just buy loads and loads of lotto tickets. but seriously some legal form of gambling. you could keep it off shore.

This could be a blockchain. 
signatures instead of hash rate. as long as the chain with the most signatures is excepted then it would be a blockchain.

Are there no childhood friends/neighbours that could vouch for her?

For extra security, I can print out paper wallets on different machines and the combine the qr off line. Even if some one is monitoring my pc, or network or printers they couldn't steal my key. But mostly because I don't own a printer so I have to make paper wallets in work :D

I've had an idea for an app called Make Me.
Say somebody is determined to loss weight. They would set up contract worth 100$ with themself. The contract would be designed so that they could only claim their money back if they spend 100hr walking and this could be verified using phone GPS. Of course this works just as well for the gym, library, supermarket etc

I genuinely don't see it being that big a problem, there are a lot of way to make stealing a meal more trouble than its worth.
Off the top of my head, A small etched QR code that could be left on the table or brought out with desert etc.
Really my point is stealing from a restaurant is very easy as it is, often where I eat people will leave cash and just go, it would be extremely easy to screw the restaurant but it's just not something that happens frequently enough for restaurant to stop people from doing it.

I hear yah, I've been in bitcoin for nearly 2 years and only did my first ever real life purchase this weekend. 
Where are all the bitcoin enabled vending machines already! :/
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:50:33
Low cost and extremely simple vending machine for farm yard sales of eggs, tomato, apples etc.
Here is how I would see it working, you go to the farm scan a qr code which gives you prices for the produce etc. 
You select what you want to buy on the app, the app sees the payment and sends back a qr code. The vending machine reads the qr code from your phone and dispense the goods.
This vending machine could be solar powered and run by say Rasberry Pie.

I like your world! 
A world where no one is ever robbed a gun point.
I don't generally feed trolls but I was feeling generous.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:15:28
A better work flow is required, ideally there would be a QR code on the table, scanning it would open a website and you pay with bitcoin. Easy no messing.

Anybody know how many exaflops the network has now? the last figure I can find is 18 exaflop but that was over a year ago.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:40:42
Sure cultural norms have a part to play. But there is still a good chuck of the world that runs the mom and pop way.
I wouldn't suggest it for late night diners in city centres, but they are mostly prepay anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:48:06
Of course and it's not a problem as they are only cheating themselves. This is about encouraging people and not about trying to trapping them. :)
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:19:49
Just checked it out and it looks good. I was going to sign up and then they started asking about employer details etc, all of a sudden I felt like I was applying for a mortatage. :(
Edit:Nearly 4% for international creditcards! I &lt;3 bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-02-15 12:40:35
Yes it was me :D I feel like a whale now with 10+ coins.
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:17:51
Cool! 
you should add this to coinmap.org also there is a meetup  who might be willing to help spread the word.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:17:06
This already exists, cant think of the app right now, it uses 2 smartphones, one phone is used for cold storage and signing an the other just to transmit..
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:01:59
I've a small amount of euro waiting for a 100e coin. I think it is best to decide now what you will do so as not to get caught up in the FUD.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:07:39
So there is a market for this sort of thing. :)
A bitcoin version would have to have some unique feature. Maybe pledging as a type of support, or group activities where each person would have one key of a multisig.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:54:39
Thanks, that is an awesome link.

Ireland is one of the most conservative countries in Europe. Strangely the recent banking crisis has made us even more timid as we know just how bad it is when you f**k it up.
The future of bitcoin in Ireland is on the fringes and in the software industry, I expect Ireland to be one of the last countries to adopt bitcoin in any significant way and it will only be adopt when we told to by the state or google etc
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:37:28
Yeah or a stolen creditcard or fake notes and if they are really athletic they could just run like f**k etc etc etc
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:35:28
Yes and they could walk in with a machine gun and rob you. You should really just serve food by sliding it under a bullet proof door but only after the customer has prepaid.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:39:25
Promotions, ad's with hidden QR codes, you can reward customers based on how much they spend, who they are, what age etc. Using multisig you can ensure they only spend the reward with you.
You could also use multisig to encourage them to get there friends to sign up.
None of this requires bitcoin but having access to a blockchain would make it a hell of a lot easier.
