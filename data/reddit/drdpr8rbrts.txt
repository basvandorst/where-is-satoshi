Wish I had been there with you.  I might be retired by now.  ;)

Is there something about ether that makes it less attractive to criminals?
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:30:54
I'm 75% BTC and 25% ETH.  
The only reason I still hold BTC is because I have a few more hours until the coinbase vault releases them.
By midnight, I'll be 100% ETH
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:11:07
It could still happen. There's no way to know for sure until it's over and we're watching in the rear view mirror.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:52:16
I'm just sick about this.  
Putting my bitcoin in coinbase's vault was the best thing I could have ever done 3 years ago.  I forgot about it, and it's finally had a nice little runup.
But there's NONE of this uncertainty with Etherium.  You can see already, the charts for the 2 currencies have diverged in a meaningful way:  when bitcoin is down, etherium is up.
Used to be, they moved in the same directions, but with different scale.
Now, though, that indicates that people are abandoning bitcoin for etherium.  
My coins come out of the vault late tonight.  I hope bitcoin is still worth something when they do.  
Honestly, at this point, I think bitcoin's demise is going to be very fast and very sudden.  I think there's a chance it might not even last until August 1.  
Bitcoin had everything.  A bunch of chinese a-holes took the crown and handed it to etherium.
There's small comfort in the fact that they'll be harmed, too.  But who knows, they're probably already mining ether and are deliberately trying to destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:41:35
I have 9 hours until my BTC hits my wallet from the vault.  Longest 9 hours of my freakin' life.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:55:26
You mean when SOME of bitcoin moves to segwit and 70% of the miners are basically acting like organized crime demanding protection money?
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:53:54
Yep, sorry.  I meant to say ETH
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:05:37
And honestly, what's drawing me to ether is that it has shown in the past that it can act quickly to deal with adverse and unanticipated situations.
Bitcoin is being crippled by some a-holes in China.  
I don't think anybody ever anticipated that in China, their effed up country would provide free electricity to some folks, and that these miners would then be able to destroy bitcoin from the inside with their stupidity and greed.
(And maybe it's not stupidity... wouldn't surprise me if they're mining ether and are perfectly content to destroy bitcoin.)
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:51:15
Will Bitcoin punch through 2,300 and stay there?
Will Ether break $200?
I think last week was less of a bubble and pop as it was the middle of a long run, with a small pause.
Of course, could be anything.  I bet a lot of retail investors buy in when the banks open on Tuesday, though.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:42:38
For all we know, Jihan has been mining Ether and wants bitcoin to fail. 
All that bitcoin mining equipment can be repurposed.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:06:23
Look, I've been long bitcoin for 3 years, but tonight, when my coins transfer from my vault, I'm 100% out.
1.  Some nerdy leader controls the movement?  Yeah, that's true.  But right now, Bitcoin is controlled by Chinese a-holes who are basically nothing better than organized crime:  they're shutting everything down if they don't get the equivalent of protection money.  "Nice little transaction you got there.  Shame if something were to happen to it.  You know, for a fee, we can make sure your transaction is safe and sound."
2.  "they split because they go hacked"
Yep.  And what happened when bitcoin got hacked?  The thieves just took everybody's damned bitcoin.  
When Etherium split, honest people got this one that's increasing by like $100 every couple of months and the thieves ended up with shitcoin.
3. "its not even intended as a store of value"
So what?  Bitcoin was intended to be a nerd's exercise in blockchain and decentralized authentication of transactions.  Hahaa!  But right now ether IS a store of value.  
4.  "But when Bitcoin resolves their scaling issues"
Bitcoin will never resolve its scaling issues.  The Chinese will make sure it never does.  The best we can do is a soft-fork.
5.  "(Etherium) will have its own scaling issues"  
But because it's in the hands of some people who can make decisions, it can fix them.
6.  "Its pretty glaringly obvious that if eth didn't already crash by then, ten at this point it will be finished in terms of its price"
I'm just going to say this. This is my personal opinion, but the Chinese are destroying Bitcoin.  You can't have a transaction currency that takes 12 hours to complete a transaction.
I honestly fear that bitcoin will probably lose a substantial chunk of it's value THIS WEEK.  It may be worth half this much in a month.  It may be worth 10 cents on the dollar by christmas and then be relegated to the irrelevant shitcoin pile with LTC.
Ether is getting all the money that's leaving Bitcoin right now.
Bitcoin will not survive the Chinese.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:37:36
The switch is happening, now.
I noticed this starting yesterday.
Used to be that both BTC and ETH moved in tandem.  If BTC went up, ETH moved up.  If BTC went down, ETH moved down.
The scale of the moves wasn't the same, but if you clicked the chart between BTC and ETH, the charts looked REALLY similar.
But now?  if you click the charts?  When ETH moves up hard?  BTC moves down.  Or, if we're lucky, BTC stays flat.
There's a massive flight from BTC to ETH right now. The only question is the exact size of it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:23:20
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:08:50
People act like ranting idiots on here, but honestly, for as long as I can remember, there have always been sincere people on here willing to share what they know. Best of luck to you!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:26:52
Hahaha!  Part of me says to keep my mouth shut until I can get out of BTC.  But people have always shared everything they knew about BTC with me.  That's one thing I love about it.  So, I'm letting folks know what I think I'm seeing.
I hope we're both rich in the future.  That'd be great.  In the mean time, though, I'm getting out of BTC and into ETH.  
You can rub my face in it if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:39:14
Same to you!  Hope we all do okay in the long run.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:28:53
I'll be stunned and overjoyed if it's anything over $2,100 by midnight tonight.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:29:42
I will care.  Bitcoin is the reason I have this money at all.  It will always be a sentimental favorite of mine.
Plus, TBH, nobody knows for 100% sure where any of this is headed.  Moving into ETH might be the worst thing I've ever done. 
I'll know here soon. haha!
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:27:27
Yep, they have first mover and greater adoption.  
But once BTC does all the hard work, it's that much easier for the next one through the door.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:53:01
ETH is not as inflationary as folks say.
BTC is only valuable if it serves as a superior medium of exchange.  ETH is already better. Cheaper. Faster.  Better.  Period.
The Chinese have proven that a small group of guys who are basically acting like organized crime ("nice little transaction you got there... shame if something happened to it") can put the brakes on ALL innovation within bitcoin.
So, not diversifying.  I'm out.  (Or at least going to flip from 75/25 BTC/ETH to 25/75... but more likely 100% ETH.)
I am willing to wager actual money that ETH is the  cryptocurrency by Christmas.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:42:44
Jihan is destroying bitcoin.  Honestly, and I've been holding this thing since 2014, but if the price doesn't plummet today I'll be stunned.  Also, if bitcoin is a factor at all in a year, I'll be stunned.
One stupid a-hole and his miner consortium are destroying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:41:30
I hope you're right.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:39:48
Yep, exactly what I noticed yesterday that made up my mind for me.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:23:40
Okay, honestly, I'm like somebody who went into a time capsule and woke up last week.  I didn't even KNOW I had tucked away a few bitcoins and thought I'd sold everything off during various fits of poverty 3 years ago.
So, I'll tell you what my process was, here.
I woke up.  Wow, my bitcoin could buy me a new car!  OMG, bitcoin, I ****ing LOVE you.  HODL.
Oh... coinbase is doing litecoin now?  How cute.  what a pile of shitcoin that thing is.  And ETH... and ... wtf?  What is ETH?
No cap on ETH?  Screw that.  
Holy ****, look at the strong moves ETH is making.  the upward movements are happening when bitcoin moves up.  The downward ones, too... but the ups are greater % gains and the downs are lower % drops.
Yesterday?  Completely decoupled and a lot of the time they were inverse:  ETH moved up when BTC moved down.
To me, that signaled that money was leaving BTC to move into ETH.
Kept reading, kept reading, kept reading.
Yep, that's exactly what's happening.  ETH is some HUGE percentage of BTC's total transaction volume right now.
But WHY?  BTC has first mover advantage in this space. WTF?
And then, reading about segwit and UASF and the problems with Jihan being a total dickcheese... 
Right now, Jihan and his chinese a-hole miner friends are basically like organized crime that has moved into the neighborhood
"Nice little transaction you have there.  Pity if something were to happen to it.  For a small fee, we can assure you protection."
They have their reasons, but for the most part, I think they're going to destroy BTC.
Your fees don't seem that bad, honestly.  But I've heard of MUCH worse, and the confirmations are taking WAY too long.
ETH is faster and cheaper.  and things get done.
For instance when ETH forked?  It was because somebody stole a bunch of ETH.  Unlike BTC, somebody ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
So, I think ETH is google.  BTC is Yahoo.  BTC refuses to get better thanks to the Jihan asshole brigade.  ETH gets better FAST when they see problems.
I think there's a good chance (personal opinion) that once ETH reaches parity, that BTC is on a path to being basically worthless.  (or at least not worth much... sort of like LTC.)
The only thing keeping BTC where it is, is their market dominance.  Once they lose that, there's no reason for BTC at all.
So, honestly, I think ETH has a future.  thanks to Jihan and crew, I don't think BTC does.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:43:49
Okay, so that reward is ONLY for the miners, then.  Not for people who are just holding ETH?
Thanks so much for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:40:30
Yep, until 2 days ago, all the movements were in tandem.  Now, bitcoin goes down, ETH goes up.  Pretty obvious stuff, here.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:26:23
Thanks so much!  This is great stuff.  I appreciate you sharing it with everyone!
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:27:56
My story is almost exactly yours.  I only hope bitcoin is still worth something tonight when my bitcoins come out of the vault.
So, you just sold your bitcoins and bought the ether, right?  No wait for the transaction?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:26:08
I really, really liked the article.  
I will point out though, that this guy is very clear that:
1.  He hasn't been right about bitcoin once, other than deciding to get into mining coins back when it could be done profitably.
2.  He is an admitted gold bug, which, frankly, is about the most ass-stupid thing an educated person could be.  Gold has every downside crypto has, and almost none of the upside.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:23:36
Thanks.  I think nobody is going to understand Chinese behavior without understanding Chinese culture.
For instance, I used to teach a lot of Chinese students.  Good lord, they would cheat like crazy.  
I would tell folks that it's not that Chinese people are dishonest or have no honor.  It's that their sense of honesty and honor are simply different than ours.
If you fail to understand that, you fail to understand them.
The trouble with waiting for an ACTUAL crisis is that it will manifest itself in bitcoin stagnation.  
Yes, I am moving to ETH.  Tonight.  Soon as my bitcoin comes out of the vault.  I'm going to liquidate at least 80% of my position and probably all of it.  I might not even leave the little bitcoin dust fragments in there.
You're right that bitcoin could fix these issues.  Unfortunately, I don't even see that as a small possibility. Nobody wants to use bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee if the transaction fee is $10 or it will take 12 hours to know if the transfer takes place.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:41:09
Yep, those a-hole chinese miners are going to destroy bitcoin.  You'd think they'd be more invested in it's future.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:47:58
Although confirmation time is one of the reasons I'm leaving BTC, that's not why the delay.
Coinbase has this feature called the vault where you can store your coins for long-term safekeeping.
If you decide to get them out, you have to wait 48 hours.  
So, that's why the delay.  Not the confirmation time.
Though that does make me wonder. After I sell, will I have to wait 12 hours or something before I can buy ETH with the money?  
I guess I'll know soon.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:34:25
Yeah, I have a few more hours to think about this, but I think my final position will be 1/3 BTC and 2/3 ETH.  
and you're right. Sentimentality is idiotic.  Bitcoin doesn't lose sleep when things go badly for me.  Haha!
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:24:04
Jihan is basically organized crime.  "Nice little transaction you got there.  Shame if something happened to it.  For a protection fee, we can make sure it stays safe."
Thing is, once the criminals move in and you can't get your mail delivered without protection money, anybody who can move out of the neighborhood will move out of the neighborhood.
If you look at the charts for BTC and ETH, you can see where the U-Hauls are headed.
Jihan will be known as the man who destroyed bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:13:12
In all seriousness, are they already mining ether?  I bet bitcoin mining hardware can be repurposed to mine ether.
At first, I thought that Jihan and crew were basically just like organized crime.
"Nice little transaction you got there.  Shame if something happened to it.  For a small protection fee, we can guarantee your safety".
But, just like the Mafiosos sent their kids to fight in WWII because deep down, they loved America, I figured the chinese a-hole consortium would not actually KILL bitcoin because they have too much invested in it.
Unless they've also been mining ether and plan to swap over to ether mining soon.
This is where democracy fails.  This is the point where democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:52:59
Interesting.  Okay, so this is a way to avoid something like the current situation where the Chinese are destroying bitcoin.  
the miners CAN chose to do their own thing, but if it doesn't take hold, they lose out.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:31:33
I'll do it tonight and let you know how it goes.  RemindMe! 1 day
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:16:40
Okay, wait, I'm an ETHtard, too.  (BTW, I'm 75% in BTC, and only 25% in ETH.  I was 100% in BTC a week ago.)
What is staking?  
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:50:27
That's what I'm doing.  Currently 75% BTC and 25% ETH.  I'll at least flip that today.  Probably will be out of BTC entirely.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:46:55
Yes, Jeff, you should.  Bitcoin is screwed because of these chinese a-holes.  Basically, organized crime has taken over the neighborhood and if you want to get your mail delivered, you need to pay protection money.
Trouble is, this is a neighborhood you can move away from with 2 mouse clicks.
Etherium is going to exceed bitcoins transaction volume like... ummm... RIGHT NOW.  It'll have price parity by Christmas.  Faster if bitcoin starts crashing, which it's looking like.
Money is flooding out of bitcoin into etherium right now. 
Thanks again, Jihan and your crew of Chinese dipshits.  You're killing your own milk cow.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:40:13
It's coming.  And fast
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:26:23
You're seeing bad news for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:45:07
It sure feels that way to me, too.  6 more hours and I can trade my BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:29:55
They are.  Look at the chart.  Look at Etherium's chart.
Jihan and his chinese asshole mafia are basically killing bitcoin from the inside.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:24:46
Yep, and soon. Within a year.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:12:48
the only reason I have this money is because of BTC.  And I don't have a lot.  Like new car money, not pay off the house money.  But I am, sentimentally, a person who loves bitcoin.
ETH is starting to make some inroads. The Koreans, if I'm not mistaken, have already flipped.  They're doing more ether than BTC.
ETH is only being added to the major exchanges like NOW.  So, until retail-ish people like me can buy it with an internet transaction, nobody is going to be doing much with it.  It'll be internet nerd stuff.  Not everybody is going to mine coins.
Obviously SOME of the appeal is that ETH is earlier in its adoption curve.  
Because of that, the risk is greater and the potential rewards are greater.
But you're right.  A handful of retailers accept bitcoin, but don't accept ETH.
But the other thing?  I only got into BTC when I had a safe way to buy it and store it.  I didn't want to be that guy with 80,000 BTC on a hard drive that hackers stole or be the guy who had $800,000 in Mt Gox who ended up being suicidal afterwards.
So, coinbase is why I felt it was safe to get in a swim.
Granted, really, coinbase proves nothing but it does prove that some guys with real money, real lawyers, nerds who really understand the technical stuff, are at least saying it's a little legit.
ETH has far heavier hitters behind it so far.
But you're right.  The risk is greater because it is earlier on the adoption curve.  But honestly, I think it has a shot at a 10X by christmas.  I really do.
BTC could, but this latest runup was pretty damned mild.
And here's the thing:  I love BTC, but always said in 10 years it'll be worth a million a coin or zero per coin.
WHAT could make it go to zero?  
2 things.  A flaw in the technology, or the appearance of a superior competitor.
We KINDA have a flaw in the technology thanks to the Chinese who refuse to fix it.  Now we have to soft-fork.
But, ETH is faster, cheaper, better. 
Which means nothing if ETH is just some nerd science project with 20 coins belonging to 50 pimply faced nerds in their mom's basement.
But it's up to $200+ and still running.  It's a store of actual wealth.  So, merchants who weren't interested when it was $8 with a tiny cap are going to want a piece of something that's say, 1/4 or 1/2 the size of bitcoin.
Once it gets to parity with bitcoin, stick a fork in it.  Bitcoin will be over.  It'll have lost to somebody better.
This, honestly, reminds me of the difference between Yahoo and Google.  Yahoo was first and best... for a while... then refused to get better while Google kicked their ass.
When I heard about google in about 2002, I thought, "that's the stupidest thing I ever heard of.  Yahoo owns that space."
Trouble is, if you're not fighting to stay ahead of everybody, somebody else will take that space.
Right now, the most powerful people in BTC are some assholes in China who are not just not trying to stay ahead of everybody, they're fighting as hard as they can to make sure BTC stays bad.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:54:37
Dude, seriously, look at the charts. David is 100% right.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:40:25
Totally with you.  Will be completely out of bitcoin by tonight.
I honestly think there's a nonzero chance that bitcoin will utterly effing crash before I can sell.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:41:24
It is doing something.  We're not going to like it, either.
