I can't really decide which of the stated solutions is the best, every of them seem legit to me.
PS: Dont use a brain wallet, just use your brain to select a good wallet :P

Snowden didn't mention nothing about that... he had no reason to hide that information, that would be rather related to his revelations.
On the other hand, it is impossible even for the NSA to track those kind of things, they still have not cracked the elliptic curve cryptography used in bitcoin and further they can't track all transactions, for instance, if I create 200 bitcoin addresses in my wallet, how could they know that those 200 addresses are mine?
I know very well the Bitcoin code and I can assure you that thas feature to link a person with his addresses is not implemented in any form.
Bitcoin is not created by the NSA. Period.

You are talking like if the NSA could see the future in 2009 when Bitcoin was launched ... no way for your arguments.
And yes, I imply that the blockchain is useless for that matter... Just count how many scammers, hackers, thieves... got their coins without nobody being able to stop them... You can tell me about Ross Ulbrich, but that does nothing to be with the blockchain.
The only real fact is that gov tried lately to control the bitcoin as much as they can, as another redditor said quoting Ghandi, they are doing exactly that... NSA is not involved, at least in the creation, maybe the interest is growing into them now, but still I doubt it, because the technical barriers that Satoshi planned carefully. Just read again my 2 comments and realize it...
