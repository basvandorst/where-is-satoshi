Can’t move BTC off cashapp. You don’t own the key.  It’s not your BTC.

I have always felt there are many people who know the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.  I find it hard to believe, several people with backgrounds in cryptography disclosed their identity to Satoshi and never really attempted to find out who he was.  They had the means to figure out his identity.  Put yourself in their shoes.  Would you conduct online business project with somebody you know very little about ...and on and on I could go....but they know.
Edit:  thank you for your great write up on Hal ��

Cashapp serves a great role for BTC.  But you can’t take BTC from cashapp.  You can essentially cash out.  But you can’t move BTC from cashapp to cold storage.

Thank you for your reply.  I have no background with computer programming or cryptography so my understanding is, I believe, basic.
But I would answer the question this way....
What factors are responsible for blockchain security and why?  
1.  All of the nodes in the network must validate the new block.  Therefore,  the majority of nodes would need to agree the block is accurate before it can be added to the block chain.
2.  Proof of work ensures there is a real cost to creating the new block.  If it is inaccurate it will be rejected and the money/electricity required to solve the proof of work is lost.
Another consideration I struggle with is mining reward and the self correcting proof of work difficulty.  We hear that miners are leaving as the price of bitcoin declines....but assume bitcoin went to 1000 USD resulting in miners leaving the network.  As the POW difficulty went down,  you could presumably mine for much cheaper (perhaps with a standard laptop) which would allow more honest miners to join the network.  Wouldn’t this have a protective effect as opposed to mining being done only by groups and businesses capable of solving such difficult POW.

Because people like you don’t answer the question and just throw stones?

You don’t own any bitcoin....Remember.

How do you transfer from cashapp to another wallet?  I can buy and sell from cashapp but not move BTC from the wallet to another wallet?  The option doesn’t exist on my app.

Thank you.

I agree.  Seems possible but quite difficult.  Particularly if the owner has a few cold wallets and moves funds around a bit.
