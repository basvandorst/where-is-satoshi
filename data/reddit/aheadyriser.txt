How do the LN devs respond to the fact that a network is not sybilproof unless it's avg hop count is less than 3? You just gave an example that could easily take more than 3 hops between channels for a tx to propoagate.

[This]( is the paper I am referring to. Bitcoin L1 has an avg distance between nodes of ~1.2. LN simulations (and real txs) have shown as many has 80 hops for a tx on LN. A p2p network is only sybilproof if this number is below 3.

I agree with the gradual process theory. I think where we might differ is that I believe BTC already had its chance to evolve into a true means of exchange. The store of value has always existed with Bitcoin because of its capped supply along with the inability to forfeit the printing/ownership of new coins. When people actually started using Bitcoin for daily transactions we hit the "means of exchange" point until the blocks became full. Once that occurred Bitcoin reverted to being a "store of value" with no means of exchange and lost points in "unit of account".
Sitting and waiting for a means of exchange solution is detrimental to BTC as a currency for this reason.

You seriously believe having something that noone spends will make Bitcoin valuable? Bitcoin is only valuable if it's a good means of exchange which hoarding and not spending doesn't satisfy.

Who is using BTC for payments? Most merchants that used to accept BTC have stopped where I live.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:50:15
In order to be a competing currency Bitcoin must satisfy three things:
* Store of value
* Means of exchange
* Unit of account 
Your points satisfy point 1 but if we cannot spend it (transaction volume leads to high fees on BTC) then we don't have a means of exchange. If you cannot purchase goods with BTC then BTC will never become a unit of account because we aren't pricing anything with BTC.
"Hoarding" and "Hodling" goes against the entire premise of a peer to peer electronic cash system.

Okay well BTC showed it has no means of exchange when the blocks were full. Which means that at one point it had ALL of the characteristics of sound money.

In order to understand Bitcoin you truly have to read the white paper. 
Satoshi defines the proof of work system and the nature of the network and ask yourselves if the current direction of development is heading in the right direction. This community would benefit from more conversation around these points and less memes.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:06:08
We don't want everyone using Bitcoin as fast as possible? This community sure has changed...
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:27:53
You're doing well :) FBI did this with TOR to shut down silk road. In networks these nodes are called Sybil nodes since they spoof the identity of a true node in the network and give you a false sense of trust.
Ask yourself if LN can be sybilled. Bitcoin layer one is Sybil resistant. I'll see you down the rabbit hole :)

Mike was forced out of Bitcoin by the community and developers (his words).
As someone else stated he's revived the project on the Bitcoin Cash network is seems.

First of all a paid transaction is not spam. If we are going to scale to Visa levels then we need to be able to handle more than 7 tps.
If we want merchants to adopt today then how can you justify full blocks?
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:46:35
I don't care about price. I want mass adoption so that Bitcoin can't be stopped and censored by world government. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:20:12
You clearly don't understand why Bitcoin is so revolutionary if you think they way. Time and history has proven what is a sound money. It has also taught us what happens when governments are capable of changing what the money supply originates from (sound money principles).
The white paper explains how the network responds to paid transactions. It's not up for us to define what transactions are good for Bitcoin and what aren't. Satoshi's invention means that there shouldn't have to be all of these other cryptos.
Just because the network is "fine for now" doesn't mean it can stand the rest of time and adoption. Satoshi's Bitcoin can scale to Visa level transactions today.

Bitcoin was never intended to be digital gold. It was defined as a peer to peer electronic cash system. You view Bitcoin as "slow but reliable, immutable and transparent" but it's supposed to be fast, cheap, and reliable as well as immutable and transparent.
The only way we make it fast and cheap is active development of a peer to peer electronic cash system which is Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is going to satisfy the definitions of a currency it has to be more than just a good store of value and immutable. It has to be a means of exchange. Without that we aren't going to compete against Visa and MasterCard handling Fiat transactions.
People investing in BTC as a store of value alone are misunderstanding the entire purpose of Bitcoin and implore them to read the white paper.

1 out of the 10 commandments is about building utility for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not worth anything if there's no utility behind it. This "investing" strategy might as well be gambling.

Bitcoin is a protocol and not a code repository. You are misinformed. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:19:35
Gavin and Mike are Bitcoin traitors? How much of this community was even around back in 2011? This is the most pathetic comment I've ever read. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:49:02
Explain why please? I don't know anyone in real life who shares that opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:13:46
haha of course he didn't read it. Because then it wouldn't allow him to just spout:


If you need to make up statistics to convince you of something then you're only hurting yourself.
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:40:26
Bitcoin is a protocol not software. And there are no limits to software. Bitcoin is genius because it exploits human qualities of greed for security. Anyone who thinks Bitcoin can be controlled by a code repository doesn't understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:06:25
Haha okay. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:10:40
Have you never heard of CoinText?
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:15:32
Yeah @_date: 2018-07-08 17:16:34
It seems like you're the only one played like a fiddle. Read "the Satoshi affair" by Andrew O Hagan to get a better understanding of what happened.
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:39:54
All of those coins share properties of Bitcoin. You are right they are copy paste clones because proof of work was a genius invention. Most of these coins are trying to emulate that.
I agree that the white paper doesn't specify any of that, which is why every one of those coins could die tomorrow and Bitcoin lives on.
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:15:14
Yup. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a software repository.
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:36:05
No, it's a peer to peer electronic cash system.
It's a protocol.
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:23:14
I have found that is full of people who have actually read the white paper and understand Bitcoin. This sub feels like a lot of shit moon memes.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:54:18
No offense, but reading this post made me realize just how idiotic most of the Bitcoin community is. I cannot believe you spent half of your post telling us a bunch of bullshit that has absolutely no basis in reality just to convince us that somehow Greg Maxwell is the savior of Bitcoin because of one tiny example that has nothing to do with any of the FUD you mentioned about miners prior to it.
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:06:46
No. Bitcoin is defined by Satoshi's white paper where it clearly says out the steps to running a node in the network. The best part about Bitcoin is that it is NOT dependent upon every node running the same client implementation.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:57:12
Lol okay. Unfortunate if you believe that.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:26:34
Wired forced the "Craig Wright is Satoshi" conversation into the public sphere. Craig wasn't ready.
