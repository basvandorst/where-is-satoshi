Why are you so fucking bad at reading comprehension?
Fallacy of composition, again.
Not being "extremely proud" =/= hating america.

I still dont see how burning the flag means you hate America.

I love how you have ZERO sources. The few links youve provided have only undermined your points.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:53:27
You ask to be treated as an individual instead of a hive mind, And yet you claim I hate america because I am liberal.
When not even half of liberals would say that.
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:56:59
No very few would.

Disprove it.

"Even if there is ultimately no proof that Trump himself knew about collusion, Trump fired Comey to make the Russia investigation go away. This is obstruction of justice and is a high crime, a legal term that includes abuse of power. This is impeachable. We know this because:
We have proof of guilty intent. Trump stated publicly that he fired Comey because he wanted him to let go of the Russia investigation. He told the Russian ambassador that the pressure of the investigation was relieved because he had fired Comey.
We have motive. His campaign did conspire to accept information from a foreign source, and firing Comey effectively attempted to cover up a crime the administration would at least have knowledge of if not directly implicated in.
Although there is very little case law on impeachable offenses, obstruction is definitely one of them. Nixon's impeachment proceedings were about exactly the same obstruction of justice and firing of investigators to cover up illegal misappropriation of campaign intel. He did the exact same thing. It amazing how clear the case law is.
Undermining the mechanisms of justice does real harm to the country. If Trump were to get away with it this time, it would make it easier for the next president to get away with more next time."

I gave multiple sources, snowflake.

"Lol the left is a hive mind"
"Lol respecting the dead is leftist!"

Ahh youre right it is I who did not read.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:11:15
Sorry that I don't want concentration camps
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:06:10
So few its not even close to an option in Gallup polls.
The lowest their rating goes is "not proud" and less than 3% respond with that.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:54:51
"I just wish the leftists could look at Americas leaders with the clarity that Trump supporters have"
Hahaha hahaha
Thanks for the laugh

@_date: 2018-07-03 04:34:20
You also shouted fake news so hard I think you gave yourself a sore throat
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:58:31
You are neitger open minded nor tolerant. Stop lying to yourself
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:54:01
Trumps only book is hitler's speeches
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:10:11
No. They dont. Liar. Stop lying to yourself.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:46:37
Did you even read the article?
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:24:29
So youre surrounded by people you refuse to talk to. Got it.
I wouldn't walk around in nazi paraphernalia either.
i have yet to see any actual proof that Hilary is corrupt (just accusations from her enemies, accusations withOUT any proof)
crooked Trump on the other hand, there is more actual evidence of his corruption than therie is of hs multiple rapes
sadly, the system is so corrupt, that
he will never see a jail cell for his many, many crimes
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:42:24
You made a lot of claims
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:22:05
Evidence please.
@_date: 2018-07-03 04:33:42
When did I say that?
