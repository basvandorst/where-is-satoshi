It seems like this is the weak part of bitcoin right now, well aside from volatility.  I can't see how bitcoin gets mass adoption without better security for the average user.  Putting coin into cold storage I would imagine is fairly complex to the novice computer user/average person.

What part of that answer had to do with Coinbase having possible login issues?  I know what cold storage is and how to use it... thanks though.

Can we pass a flat tax already and abolish the IRS. That brings up a question...it will probably never happen, but assuming somehow a flat tax system was implemented in the U.S., wouldn't that remove any capital gains on bitcoin as you would only be taxed on items you consume or purchase?

I cannot deposit on Circle even after verifying my bank account. I emailed their customer support several days ago and still have not gotten a response. I'll stick with Coinbase.

I had no idea coinbase was insured.  Never seen anything when I logged into my account. Thanks.  I guess the only advantage is transaction fees then?  I do like the Coinbase vault feature though.

Wouldn't they only be able to do that if I stayed logged into Coinbase and walked away from my computer?  If I'm sitting in front of my computer, there is no way they can pull that off remotely?  I log off as soon as I'm done with my session every time.  Anyway, I'll probably just move 99% of my coin to cold storage anyway just to be safe.  I'll most likely install Armory and use their system.

Assuming that the site holding your BTC doesn't get hacked, how could someone possibly steal your coin if you're using 2FA (like requiring entering a text code from your cell, or using an app like Google Authenticator...assuming your Google account isn't compromised).  I know in this case it wasn't used, just trying to decipher how much I feel safe keeping in an online wallet with 2FA.  Executing multiple transactions offline to keep your cold wallet safe seems to be quite tedious.

Every time I log into Coinbase, I have to enter a text code from my cell phone before it will let me log in to do anything.  There is an option to check "Do not require authorization on this computer for 30 days" or something to that effect, but I never click that.  Unless a hacker also had access to my phone, I don't see how they could move any coins out of my wallet.

I would never put all of my coin, or anything of significant value into a hot wallet. Thanks anyway though. I was just talking about a spending wallet for online transactions.

I've been very happy with my Capital One 360 account (checking/savings). I've also rolled over my Roth IRA into Sharebuilder, which is owned by Capital One . Their mobile apps are excellent, and fees are cheaper than Fidelity for online trades.

I'll probably leave the majority of my bitcoin in cold storage, minus a small bit and try the bitcoin app on Windows Phone for small purchases.

I'm not sure if the government itself can do anything, but this is a huge threat to the banking system.  I don't think they will take this lying down if bitcoin really starts to take hold.  The government can't shut it down, but they (the government in coordination with Wall St./Banks/Fed) will probably try to corner the market somehow if they can and devalue the crap out of it.  Try to scare people out of using bitcoin.  It's taken hundreds of years for central banks to get a stranglehold on global finance like they have now.  No way they are giving up that kind of power easily.
If the demand for dollars plummets because more people are going for bitcoin, that means the Fed has to purchase more U.S. debt to finance the bloated U.S. government.  The powers that be won't like that either.

I have a few accounts, but the one I used was through Fidelity Investments.

Windows phones have seen very high growth rates over the last 12 months. Even though their market share is only around 4%, they are growing by leaps and bounds (especially in emerging markets). I currently use a Nokia Lumia 1520 and love it. I'd like to see some development on the Windows 8/Windows Phone 8 platform. Windows Phone has its own built in wallet feature where I download my airline QR codes to. I'm sure a great app could be ported over for bitcoin. I believe Apple is more threatened by bitcoin because they would like to implement their own payment system eventually. It's probably a direct threat to their plans. Hopefully as bitcoin grows they will have no choice to accept bitcoin apps as phone buyers will opt for a different, more friendly bitcoin platform.

I have a Nokia Lumia 1520. Runs Windows Phone 8, and they do have a few bitcoin apps. Integrates with the wallet function inside the OS. Really like this phone. If I went Android, it would be Nexus or bust.

I signed up on coinbase yesterday, and didn't even see this as an option. I did the verification process where they make small deposits into your account. Should be there by tomorrow. Hopefully it goes smoothly, I'd like to buy some btc before it goes over $1,000 USD.

The article didn't really talk much about how this technology would work compared to bitcoin, except for the fact that it wouldn't be anonymous.

I've never had issues before verifying with other services like PayPal. Usually 1-2 day ACH transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:49:33
I started the verification process this past Monday.  Still nothing.  I even got a reminder email from coinbase to verify my account.  Problem is, I have not gotten the two small deposits into my account yet.  They must be having issues with all the demand they are facing the past few weeks.

I did look at localbitcoins, but it seemed like a hassle as the only guy who took cash lived on the other end of town.  Coinbase seemed easier at the time, and I wanted to get an account established anyway for future purchases.  I submitted my info on Monday, and it says it can take 3 business days, so I'm not sure if today was considered a business day or not.  Probably have to wait until Monday now :( I'm hoping for a correction back down to $800-$900.

I just recently downloaded this app, but am paranoid because it doesn't support 2FA. Recently purchased my first bitcoin, but might just use SMS for now, unless this app gets support for 2 level authentication. Any chance for that in the future? I'm not familiar with OATH. Can you explain how this works? I just want to make sure my btc is safe.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:44:28
Yeah, looking back on it I should have bought in cash earlier this week on localbitcoin.  Oh well...just hope I can get my coinbase account approved on Monday.
