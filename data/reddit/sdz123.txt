Just got an email reply : "You deposit was temporarily cancelled by our system for a manual review. This can happen occasionally with new accounts. You should be able to transact freely now." Its sorted now and worked with my credit card too. I have a 0% Halifax "Clarity" card for foreign transactions so it should be a good rate. I'm limited to $500 per week though.

I've tried but my deposit failed. I've since tried adding a debit rather than credit card and it shows up as a credit.

There's a lot of other text that still needs translating too...

Also non-complete cancelled orders still increment the order number.

The UK needs this for sure but I reckon it won't be long before their bank puts a stop to it.

As someone who's phone had to be replaced and is going through trying to gain access to all my 2FA'd accounts I wish I had known to save them somewhere secure as a backup.

I got one of these emails too. Here is is in its entirety :
Dear sdz123,
Unfortunately we are no longer able to transfer funds to Bitcoin exchanges. This decision has been taken pending the outcome of ongoing discussions with our banking providers and the relevant regulatory bodies, we do hope it is a temporary one.  While we still believe in the strong growth and acceptance of bitcoins, we are waiting for clear guidance on the requirements for meeting our regulatory obligations specifically in relation to AML/CTF legislation.
 
We have not taken this decision lightly and understand that this will cause major inconvenience to your activities.  CurrencyFair will be working towards a solution and apologise that this service will be no longer available to you.
 
Do not worry if you have already sent funds to your CurrencyFair account. We will honour any transfers you have already instructed.
 
You are of course more than welcome to use CurrencyFair but we will no longer be able to transfer funds to any Bitcoin exchange.
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
 
Best regards
