Hi guys. Ive got a question. Someone mentioned to me that btc cannot go lower than 5k coz at that price miners will not earn anymore. However, the price of btc used to be much lower. So how is that possible? Please enlighten me. This is not meant to be a fud by the way. I really just want to know the answer.
