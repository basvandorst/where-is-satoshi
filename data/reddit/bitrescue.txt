But is it really?


But the overall interest of everyone is the same. To have a network that actually scales. Scaling the sytem by *just* inscreasing the block size with a new fixed limit is a really poor hack, not much to discuss there.
No one is saying that LN an SW are by themselves the final end scaling solution, hell even the LN paper states that bigger blocks are needed in order to serve the true global transaction needs of the world, but they will give the devs more time to find the best way to actually go about fixing the block size issue.

This is exactly what I'm thinking as well. 
Contrary to what many people in the bitcoin space think, I see absolutely no reason why ordinary people would want to use bitcoin directly as a way to pay for goods in physical stores, as long as they have a relatively stable local currency. 
As an example I can point to the lack of adoption of euros in EU member states that are not a part of the eurozone. Many stores in those countries accept both euros and the local currency as payment, but only tourists from the eurozone pays using euros, and please remember that there are no huge volatility between those currencies unlike between bitcoin and everything else.
It seems that as long as there is something that works reasonably well people see no reason to change old habits.

How so? VAT applies to everything sold within the EU, and if you buy something from outside the EU and get it shipped to you, you have to report and pay the VAT yourself. Likewise if a business inside the EU is selling to someone outside the EU, VAT is not included in the price.

So clearly the solution is a: "regulatory approach to address these risks [that] would require a substantial body of regulation" ?
These corrupt lying rotten institiotions is the exact reason why crypto currencies were invented in the first place, there soon is no need for them anymore. 
Of course it takes time to develop the perfect crypto, no on can get something massive like that 100% perfect in the first go.

If VAT is required there will be no legal way for EU citizens to buy bitcoins without having to pay VAT in some form.

But it does so equally for large and small companies. If not, this is due to other loopholes or criminal activities that then needs to be addressed.


If you buy from outside the EU, it is your own responsibility to pay VAT. If you fail to do so then YOU are braking the law.

- There is absolutley no word of Bitcoin when I go to their site - though I can see that they are big McAfee and Norton fans.
- I can't get the price listed in BTC.
- Even after I put something in my cart and press on checkout, there is still no word of bitcoin.
So a potential cuctomer has to first find what they want to buy and then put it in the cart and then make a user at the site and fill in all their shipping information, before letting them know that they can actually pay with bitcoins... What?

No, miners alone are not bloat. But 21 clearly plan for these millions of devices to spend the mined bitcoins as micro payments as well. The bitcoin network as we know it today cannot handle that amount of transactions if every single micro payment has to be recorded in the block chain.

Because creating your own hardware using subsidized electricity and then using the same hardware for mining bitcoin also using subsidized electricity makes a great vehicle for transferring value out of the Chinese dictatorial system, something that is worth doing even at a loss.

However there is a deep divide between all the Chinese miners and the rest of the international community. How many Chinese miners are present at any of the international gathering points like r/bitcoin? None. They stay to themselves and live mostly in ignorance which makes them easy targets for manipulation. Sad, but true.
From the original article:


@_date: 2015-05-18 19:52:26


So these earnings are meant to be spent for micro payments...
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:42:28


If the law is not broken, then there is no problem. This seems to be the philosophy that even politicians are following, so I see no moral problem doing so myself.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:24:50


Your idea doesn't fit well with what the article states.


@_date: 2017-02-25 17:37:06
The skewing is happening on many levels. Not only is the mining happening with artificially cheap electricity, the mining equipment is also produced locally with subsidies, and on top of that, if you are a rich chinese person who want to get a lot of money out of the regime mining at a loss can still be a very good deal. No free and open market can compete with the skewing produced by the chinese regime.
However it would probably be very naive to think that the chinese miners will be totally out of the game if bitcoin really was made illegal. They would probably just continues their business from somewhere else in the 3rd world.
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:15:32


Yeah, same thing here. But things might get funky for you if your now illegal bitcoin investment is suddenly worth millions. It's like a death spiral to start doing illegal things in the dark. Might as well just find a legal loophole.




It would, yes.


I can only speak for my country, if you as a private person in a year is selling for more than 6700 EUR you are required to pay VAT. And then you might as well start your own company and trade business to business without VAT.

@_date: 2015-05-20 19:03:08
Yeah, and guess who's fault it is.
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:56:24


But then what is the point of paying with bitcoin in the first place? 
Also I take from your answer that you don't often buy things from outside the USA. If every store that accepts bitcoin would display prices directly in BTC, no on had to know the exchange rate of more than their own local currency and bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:50:47
So again, the solution is of course heavy centralised government regulation, because, that always works out fantastic.

So these millions of devices will never make any transactions? All right, got it!
They are talking about micro payments right and left, so it is quite clear that they want these devices to send transactions. So clearly their plan can not be "to do nothing" as stated above. In that light, is it not fair to ask what their plan for scalability is? 
Edit: more text.
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:33:45
Well in that case the savings should obviously go to incentivising the customer to use of bitcoin, since the store owner gets benefits of lower risk of fraud as mentioned above.
@_date: 2015-05-13 12:42:54
More communication about the progress would have been really nice though.
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:45:35


And what is the plan for not bloating the block chain with these millions (billions?) of devices?
Edit: Why downvote me for asking a relevant question?
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:53:30
But 21 plan for the devices to SPEND as well.
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:48:37

@_date: 2015-05-20 19:09:47
Not only that, but a government will never be able to give away all control and make it open for everyone to participate on a level playing field, exactly the things that will make bitcoin a success.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:07:13
Exactly, we all need to be very critical of 21's plan until they make it very clear that they will not centralize all the power in their own hands.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:43:39
Let's just hope that their answer is an open system for everyone to use like the proposed Lightning Network, and not their own closed proprietary off-chain solution.
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:28:59

@_date: 2015-05-18 20:12:05
Potentially yes, and something like that would be my guess too. However, I would like to hear what 21's plan actually is.
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:19:52
Because someone would either have been more lucky than possible, or have more computer power than possible.

But often you see the potability of displaying prices in a selection of various fiat currencies, so one should think that adding BTC to that list would not be all that difficult.


But isn't that more of a myth? I mean, since the stores always use a third party to convert bitcoin to fiat don't they just take the fees instead of the credit/debit card companies?
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:21:51
Actually VAT in the EU is a huge mess. For instance if you buy silver coins (not bars) from Estonia, there is no VAT at all, and silver coins bought from Germany is only subject to a very low VAT (7%), while silver coins bought in Denmark is subject to a full VAT at 25%

In the case of a complete mining majority by one actor, bitcoin is no longer more secure than any other centralized system. It would be a dictatorship. The counterbalance doesn't mean much if the dictator is a state, since they can operate outside of the free market, look at China.
What other things than this counterbalance would make bitcoin trustless in a case with complete mining centralization?
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:24:13

@_date: 2017-03-19 09:35:13


The people behind BU states that they just want bigger blocks. Segwit delivers bigger blocks now, and buys time for planning a safe hard fork in the future if necessary. So the logic here would be to just activate segwit.
However, the big actors behind BU stand to gain a much bigger "reward" if they further centralize power in their own hands.


And together with second layer solutions that is more than enough for a very long time. Long enough time to plan for a safe hard fork.


And neither would 50MB be. That is why smart people are working on second layer scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:32:07


Reducing **his** mining powers by acknowledging that centralization is bad and actively thinking about and testing methods to combat the mining centralization. BU does not seem to be keep on doing any such thing. No one is talking about overall reducing mining power. There has to be a balance of course.

I understand what you are saying, and I too think that many people will jealousy think that the bitcoin distribution will be unfair. 
But jesus, just look at the world today, do I really have to bring up the poor African rich Westerner cliché? The world IS extremely unfair as it is now, but I see bitcoin as a way of creating a level playing field for all. That unfortunately means that the distribution in the beginning could be seen as unfair, but I would rather have 10,000 geeky visionary Elon Musk billionaires than the rich passive elite we have today.
And about Satoshi, just think what a person with his value set could do of good things for humanity with that kind of wealth. I am honestly all for it. I like to think that bitcoin is only part one of his great master plan, that his end goal is to build an entire utopian nation from scratch. One can always dream I guess.

No one can. Code does not exist in a vacuum. However, having to pick a side, I would go for the side that works against mining centralization and not for it any day.

What's stopping criminals from using shoes? Criminals are using shoes when they conduct their criminal activities! 
If we could just engineer shoes so that they all have explosives build into them that could be triggered remotely. Then we could create a centralized agency that would keep track of which shoes that should explode! And we should then by law force all shoe manufacturers to only make shoes with explosives so that criminals cannot avoid getting these shoes!
My god! We have just solved all problems regarding criminal activities in this world!
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:10:47
First of all. Your naive and primitive assumption that you can cleanly separate the ball from the man in this game is simply ridiculous to say the least. As an example, can you please tell me what plans Roger Ver and Jihan Wu have to eliminate Wu's mining majority as fast as possible? .... No? If they were operating outside of any personal interest in gaining or keeping control over the network, they would of course have such plans in the BU pipeline or already be experimenting with solutions like core currently is.
Criticizing BU itself? Alright, the code is buggy and trying to do something a serious as a hard fork with buggy code could potentially end up as a catastrophe. A hard fork takes a lot of work and time to plan and execute by many talented people. Why risk anything when segwit delivers bigger blocks now in a safe manner. When segwit has been activated, developers can start the hard work of looking into the possibilities of increasing the block size with a hard fork some time in the future.

I really wish your naive views on things were correct. Nothing would make me happier than to be wrong about this. But given the track record of the people behind BU and their actions, nothing is pointing in that direction, sadly.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:04:30


So would I. But a solution will clearly not come from BU because there is absolutely no incentive for them to work on one, quite the contrary. How much research has Wu and co. done into the viability of changing to a PoS system lately? Or even, how many of the BU people are actively speaking out loudly about the problems regarding mining centralization?
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:01:47






Complete mining centralization would be no different than a trusted third party. Making bitcoin dead from the beginning.
Putting your trust in this counterbalance is like saying that there will never be any evil dictators in this world, because it is in any rulers interest to keep people happy so they don't revolt.

You assume that everyone base their actions purely on logic. If they did, there would be no conflicts because segwit delivers. But sadly they don't. Jihan Wu is either willing to gamle everything he has on gaining even more power, or he is bluffing. 
I hate conspiracy theories as much as the next guy, but it doesn't take much intellect to see that BU has nothing to offer for anyone but those in control of it. On top we see all the dirty tricks being used by them to further their cause instead of using reason to argue.

The question is, does one prefer a highly volatile currency with no predictability or a currency that is controlled to decrease with 2-4% a year. I will not be the judge. But while a lot of bad things could be said about fiat and fractional reserve banking, it is key to understand that if it wasn't for that system, we would not have seen the advances in technology and living standards that we have today.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:18:24
The need for bitcoin simply isn't there *yet*. At least that is what I think. Bitcoin is by it's nature open for everyone to create and develop on, so in the future I'm sure that we will see things that we today cannot even imagine.

It is really difficult to find vital company information on your site, is it even there?
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:54:42
But on the surface bitcoin is a much less attractive solution than what banks here already offer with phone apps. They take no fees and lets you pay and transfer money in the local currency directly to and from your banking account instantly. She doesn't care about decentralization or sending money across borders, she just wants to make payments with the least amount of friction.
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:50:01
Because bitcoin is sooo uncool, haven't you heard?
@_date: 2015-07-04 13:28:55

Cool, I'll keep that in mind the next time I post something.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:43:43
A lot of people here are talking about the total collapse of our monetary system in a very near future, however I think that they are underestimating the ability of the establishment to "kick the can down the road". Back when Nixon ended the dollar gold standard a lot of people where predicting doom within a short time frame.
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:50:23
With all due respect it does seem like the US is not exactly a leading country when it comes to banking infrastructure, cheques and no nationwide banking apps for instant payments? Bitcoin does seem quite a bit more attractive to ordinary people in such an environment.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:32:53
As already said, if enough people believe it works, it works.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:49:20
We need to realize that to us geeks the inner workings of a revolutionary decentralized network might be the coolest thing ever, but why should that be exciting to ordinary people who just needs to make payments? Do you care much about the nature of nuclear chain reactions when you just need power to make coffee?
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:55:31
Not very exiting, no. The answer is of course clear to all since bitcoin is programmable money, and there is no VAT on money. End of story.
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:56:21
The truth is often to be found somewhere in the middle, I don't believe in a total collapse in the near future but the current system is not sustainable either.
I too believe that bitcoin will live alongside fiat for a very long time. There is room for both, and perhaps the blockchain will one day be used to make payments directly in fiat as well as bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:04:22


Bitcoin so uncool! Blockchain so hip!

@_date: 2015-07-29 15:51:09
And why exactly does that sound like something I would make up? Because this real world example doesn't fit into the bitcoin echo chamber? I'm a huge believer in bitcoin in the long run, but the reality is that to a lot of people in the developed world, it doesn't make much sense to use today. Like it or not.
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:09:08
Fiat decreased in value by 2-4% a year, making it seem like everything (including gold) became worth more at a very slow rate. If you could have bought milk and pancakes back then and sold it today, it would have seemed like you'd made money too.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:59:39
In many countries the traditional banks already have systems that offer a very similar (centralized though) payment experience to what bitcoin can offer, and that without the user having to worry about any volatility/exchange rates and not having to buy new bitcoins all the time. If bitcoin is to take off as a direct payment solution in environments like that, it needs to offer something extraordinary that everyone can agree to is much better than what already is available.
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:15:48
Make no mistake, I would love if bitcoin would be adopted as a secondary currency in the world. Sadly that is not what I'm seeing where I live, perhaps because the centralized alternative from the banking industry here is so relatively good. 


Which is exactly the reason why I posted this. She has never returned any of my gifts, and if I give her something she doesn't like, she usually finds a way to sell it and make some money from it. I did tell her about the limited supply and all the things that makes bitcoin fantastic, I even told her about a place where she could buy her favourite take away for bitcoin... I haven't asked her in detail why she gave it back, but perhaps I should.


It is hugely biased and people usually just down vote constructive criticism of bitcoin without any counterarguments.

That is the network effect of an open system, and the exact reason why Citicoin and Fedcoin will fail.
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:16:44
In most of the developed world (It seems that the US is an exception) the banking infrastructure and user experience is far superior to what bitcoin can offer right now. Want to send money to your friend? No problem, most banks have apps for that, no need to go and buy bitcoin first and then convert it back to the local currency again afterwards. But stating this fact is not popular here and most of the time it gets you down voted without any counter arguments.
This does of course NOT mean that there is no big future for bitcoin even in the developed world for everyday person to person payments, it only means that this is the last place to adopt bitcoin for that kind of use.
On the other hand, micropayments, machine to machine payments, international remittances are a few areas where bitcoin is far superior to what any banks can offer now using their legacy systems.
@_date: 2017-04-29 20:16:17

But again, what is the advantage from the users perspective? If Circle holds my bitcoin I'm still putting all my trust in them, and there are orders of magnitude more merchants who accept Paypal than bitcoin.

It is a poor mining rig just as much as a Tesla roadster is a really poor horse wagon. Try to forget the fact that this is an overpriced oversized developers kit for a second. 
Now imagine a tiny more efficient and cheaper chip that is ubiquitous in all electrical devices, then suddenly users can convert electricity into small amounts of bitcoin to buy and sell services. 
Take a mobile phone, it could potentially have many ways to earn and use bitcoin, mining through the 21 chip is just one way to convert electricity directly into bitcoin. Here are a few other ways off the top of my head:
* Selling/buying 4g bandwidth and wifi
* Selling/buying storage space
* Selling/buying power through wireless power charger
"Oh, but it would be much cheaper to just buy and put bitcoin directly on the device!!!11"
But that doesn't secure the network or help to build the bitcoin infrastructure in any way. And yes, now the mining seems to be centralized at 21inc, but hopefully that can be decentralized in the future, if so, a network with millions of devices mining the blockchain would be much more resilient than what we have today.
It is also not only about the efficiency of mining of the device, but much more about making it possible for people to take part in a world where everything is a service and everyone is buying and selling just what they need when they need it, without having to press any actual buy or sell buttons actively. It is all done in the background automatically. 
If I have some extra bandwidth that I'm not using my phone will sell it and maybe buy some power through the wireless charging pad on my table at Starbucks.

Somehow all the negativity found in this community towards 21inc's idea starts to make me feel that they might be on to something.

This whole thing brings up another interesting question though. We all love the dezentralized nature of bitcoin, but when this concept of *no one person in charge* is spread out to the rest of the net, what is to stop fraudsters from taking advantage of poor and uneducated people?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:52:26

Black economies are more widespread in dysfunctional countries, because it is easier to hide in those places.

The fact that you need to have the ability to adopt to constant changes has been very outspoken as long as I can remember. That can cannot be a surprise to anyone other than Neanderthals who are still stuck in the middle of the last century.
Now *they* need to adopt or die, just like the fucking rest of us at the assembly lines. They arrogantly though that they were safe in their ivory towers, that somehow they were above evolution and the rest of us. Boy they were wrong.

Szabo seems really keen on smart contracts, so that would have been a really high priority in the bitcoin system from the beginning if he really was Nakamoto. Instead the development all those things in the bitcoin system were put in the background back then.

With your numbers and power prices pulled of the net, I will have to pay 62 US dollars just in power to run a full node where I live. That is more than half of my food budget. Now on top of that you can put Gavins *couple thousand dollars per year* in hardware. There are no subsidies for running a full node, and yet there are complaints that not enough people are running nodes - indeed some people have lost touch with reality.

While this of course sounds like a joke, just try to look at it from the banks point of view. If the banks all have SWIFT nodes, to them it would be a decentralized system, and it wouldn't level the playing field for real competition from outsiders like bitcoin would.

This is a joke, right? You should go and study what the difference between open and closed systems and network effect does to the difference in success of systems. You should also look into future applications of open systems like bitcoin, the future is not just more of the same but with computers. You are painting a very naive and primitive picture of what this technology could potentially do.
That being said, sure banks can save a buck on using a private blockchain instead of the steam engines they use today, but that is NOTHING compared to what an open ledger will do in the future. IOT anyone?

@_date: 2015-03-08 12:10:20


Using a different consensus algorithm and getting a deal with a hardware company to get a head start in securing the new network does not sound impossible to me for a large entity like SWIFT. In the beginning only banks would get access to mining hardware, until other hardware companies starts to make SWIFT ASICs.

You are free to build whatever you want on the bitcoin network, not so much on the private blockchains that the banks are talking about, unless you are a bank yourself and they let you into the club. 
So where do you think that the innovative and disruptive financial applications that will turn everything upside down will be developed? In the close banking club of the status quo, or in the place where Silicon Valley (And the rest of the world for that matter!) can play and have fun without any constraints?

No, they are *not* using bitcoins. However, they *are* using cash, gold, and shoes too. They *could potentially* use bitcoin if their infrastructure allowed them to do so, and that is a actually a good thing, just like it is a good thing that anyone in the world can use shoes without the blessing from a state. Oh boy am I getting tired of all this FUD.

@_date: 2015-03-08 12:25:46


Not if they use a proprietary consensus algorithm and make a deal with a hardware company for making ASICs. In the beginning only banks would mine, then slowly the ASICs would be licensed to other "trusted" entities, and then in the end it would also be possible for the Chinese to use pirate ASICs to help secure the network.
On the other hand, bitcoin faces the chicken and egg problem with getting the really big players to use it.
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:53:00
Pi's are really too slow and have too little ram to function as good nodes. I speak of experience. Sell them all and buy a bigger computer with more ram.

World Gold Holdings (2011): 171,300 tonnes
171,300 / 14,000,000 = 0.0122357142857143 tonnes per bitcoin
that's 12.2357142857143 kilos * 36,707.15 (gold price in kilos) = **449138.1996428577**
So for bitcoins today to be priced higher than gold, one bitcoin should cost around half a million dollars. Of couse more gold have been found since 2011 and the total supply of bitcoin will be higher than 14 million. Swap the numbers as you please.

@_date: 2017-06-21 05:16:11
You fund it by having someone sending bitcoin to you. If you ask me, using addresses on a user level to send and receive bitcoin is not really ideal for a simple money transfering app. There should be a layer on top of that too, so I can just pick you from a list, and send you money. And when I buy bitcoin, I Will have them transferred to my "identity".
I'm of course being a bit provocative in all this. But when you take a look at all the wallets today, it is very clear that they have the technology in the center, not the user. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:28:54

Of course that depends on the intented purpose of the program but for a money transferring app, a receiver and an amount, ought to be enough user inputs to make a transaction.
