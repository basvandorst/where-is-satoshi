That would be the simplest way. If you want to trade bitcoins for fiat currency you have to find someone who is willing to trade with you. You can do that by finding someone locally near you and do it in person, or you have to use a bitcoin exchange to trade with anyone using that exchange. But that requires that you let a third party (the exchange) handle your money and there are fees involved.

He met another person who had fiat cash, a bitcoin wallet and a desire to trade with him.

Bitcoin is a technology and a tool.  
Replace "bitcoin" with "hammer" in the article and you see what I mean.  
I can use a rock as a hammer if I want. I can design my own application that interacts with the bitcoin protocol if I want. Using the rock as a hammer may not be very safe and secure just like my own application may not be safe and secure. But the function is still the same.  
Someone can design a very good hammer that is precise and easy to use and try to market the brand of that hammer design just like someone can design a great bitcoin application and market the brand of that.

The wallet.dat file contains keys. One is secret, the others are public and can be generated on the whim and are also called addresses. If I am not completely mistaken.  
Your wallet does not contain the bitcoins. It gives you access to them on the bitcoin network. Without the secret key, you cannot sign transactions.  
You can have multiple copies of the wallet and you only need one to have access to the bitcoins linked to that wallet.  
You are right otherwise. You need a bitcoin client to connect to the network, and you need a copy of a wallet to gain access to the bitcoins linked to it.

Cost is not the same as value. If the cost of mining bitcoins is higher than the value of the bitcoins mined, people will stop mining. If I was a miner I would at least. In short, the mining of bitcoins will **not** be lucrative forever.
This can be compared to gold and gold mining. Gold is a rare metal and therefore can be used as currency, because it has a value of being rare and sought after. Why gold is sought after is a different topic.  
When gold is found in an area, there will probably be a gold rush. People who think that they can get rich by digging it up will do so, and later trade the gold for things that they want and need.  
This is very lucrative in the beginning. The first miners who get there will get the most gold. The tools that they buy and the time they waste is worth it in the end.  
Until the gold runs out.  
When the gold is mined out, the cost of tools and the time that is wasted will not be worth it anymore. There will still be value in the gold that they dug up though. And its value has nothing to do with the cost of digging it up.

Something is worthless when people think it is worthless.  
If something is overpriced it means that the potential buyer thinks that the item is not worth the price.  
Supply and demand is an underlying mechanic that sets the prices of commodities. High demand - low supply means that the ones who can pay the most can get the items and the price rises. When the demand goes down people might think that the item is overpriced and the seller might lower the price because no one wants to buy.  
One hypothetical example:  
A new medicine is developed. It completely cures the common cold and it works quickly and flawlessly (it seems). Everyone wants it but there is a low supply of it and it takes time to make. The price rises because of low supply and high demand. Only the richest can afford it. After a month some side effects get linked to the medicine. It is a deadly side effect and it is incurable. Something highly valued just became completely worthless. Was it worthless from the beginning?

I would use two different wallets. One that is encrypted and safe, the other active in the bitcoin program. Then send bitcoins to the encrypted wallet if you want them safe.  If your wallet is copied, it doesnt matter if the thief gets to your active wallet. He can easily transfer the money to one of his own wallets.

Short answer:  
Cost ≠ value.

I should have not used the word burn when I described the private key and address. The key is completely random and the address too. The address will be used to send bitcoins to the hidden private key sent to mars. That is all.

Ooooooh, I just got an idea.  
Make a paper wallet with a known address and completely secret private key. Put it in a probe. Send it to mars. When the probe lands safely, release the address to the public.  
People can freely "burn" bitcoin by sending to that address.  
Watch as that wallets value grows and the race for mars begins.

Isn't this problem solved already with physical bitcoins? A physical bitcoin is basically a paper wallet with a hidden unkown private key on it.

If time is fixed there will be a greater chance of two or more miners reaching the same distance from the target when the time is up. This means a greater chance of forks. Forks are not good.

[Uh, yes?](  
Alright, after some reading I agree that the actual printing and hiding of the private key has to be done under extreme scrutiny and the creator of the key and tamper proof seal has to be liable if the key is accessed before anyone actually removes the tamper proof seal.

The intention was to put a "treasure chest" on mars. Anyone would be able to send bitcoin to that address. But to get the treasure you would need to go get the key. So it would be an incentive for further mars exploration.

No one can buy if no one will sell.  
The price goes up because people are willing to buy what is for sale for a higher price. It would be stupid for the sellers to not set the price at that level. Profit you know.   


People are willing to sell. Otherwise it would not be such a high price. If the price gets stable it means that the value is satisfactory for both the buyers and the sellers.  


The price drops because the sellers set lower prices. If you want something sold, lower prices will attract buyers.  
If it was a bubble that popped, something made the commodity for sale worthless and the sellers don't want the commodity anymore. Everyone tries to get rid of the commodity and the price drops like a rock.  
No one is willing to buy because the commodity is worthless.  
**tl;dr:**  
What causes a bubble is not that people buys and not sells. What causes a bubble is that what is for sale becomes worthless for some reason.
