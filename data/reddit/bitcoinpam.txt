Dude - how can you not realize you're 100% accountable in the crypto-space?  Nobody "made" you do anything - you are responsible for any good or not-so-good decisions YOU made.  Sorry - sucks to be an adult, doesn't it? :)

They use software for algorithmic trading - you should research it.  And they do not claim the trades you see are what is actually being traded – that is merely eyecandy on the dashboard.  In fact, you're the only person I've ever known to event consider that it was "actual" trades.
I respect your position on a ponzi – but I can't argue with the additional bitcoin I've been able to acquire without spending more cash to buy it.  TCC is not a "bitcoin doubler" – but it is allowing me to acquire more bitcoin, and I'm doing it on the house's money as I've already pulled out my original invested amount.  You do what you feel most comfortable with, of course.  I am just sharing my own personal experience - which has been a good one :)

Yes, I can - forgive my ignorance, but is that something I should post?  the transaction ID?

What a pleasure to read insightful, helpful info shared and commented on by everyone giving their perspective without malice or ridicule.  I must say, this is one of the best posts I've come across recently :) Thanks all for the "food for thought"!

Might sound simple – but I don't think "Bitcoin Cash" will prevail over Bitcoin for the technical reasons listed here, plus some marketing reasons.  Newbies to crypto don't know or understand the tech issues, but they are subject to marketing 101 influencers. The fact is (with maybe 2 exceptions) the top 100 brands consumers trust are all one-word-names...just sayin' – Globally, 91% of consumers said they are willing to reward a brand for its authenticity by recommending it to friends or buying the product. Bitcoin Cash has no "authenticity", plus brands also have to stand the test of time – and they need consumers to feel "it's not just all about the money".  Additionally – the BCH name instantly brands it as a "knockoff".  Might be why there has been such an effort to crown a knockoff with the name "bitcoin"?

I've withdrawn 3.67 - and with 60 days remaining on my club contract, I should withdraw another 2.8 BTC in profit at the avg daily rate of earnings.  I make weekly withdrawals.

In contrast to this post - I am a TCC member, have been since Feb.  It is quite obvious that actual trading is occurring and the returns I am personally realizing is proof of that.  This person is vague and non-specific in his criticism of Trade Coin Club - sounds like someone with either a hidden agenda or a total lack of knowledge as to how the system works, thus has been unprofitable for him/her.  It has been very profitable for me, and many, many others that I know of personally.  I would recommend that interested parties check the "facts" before taking this person's advice and missing out on an opportunity that appears sustainable and profitable.  Just my two cents.
