That is the spirit, focus on the messenger and not the message. You familiar with logical fallacies? 
You should watch the guest, he gives dates of banks/institutions lies and then shows they went out and bought what they said not to. Financial Terrorism.
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:16:32
Again, I'm not so sure that some of what they are doing is illegal. Some of that from the video was EXTREMELY aggressive lying, at the cost to many. Remember, there is financial loss involved. A good lawyer...
Been doing my part and then some, but good advice.
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:54:38
Not talking about Ripple and I'm not really even concerned with Teeka.
It boils down to this - Is it true about institutions buying Bitcoin on those dates?
If so, then let go of him and focus on the information and it's meaning. I haven't researched it all, but some of what he said there is indeed true.
edit - fair point though, be careful of the guy if you think he is lying.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:39:45
But CNN said it, they don‘t lie, do they? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:43:35
The man being interviewed states that when companies (e.g. JP Morgan) tell people not to buy Bitcoin and then they themselves go against that and buy it, is NOT illegal? This seems like an opinion here as these people, as stated, definitely caused people to not buy, sell, etc., causing them financial harm. There are many examples of this in the video, must watch!
What about government agencies that are here to protect us investigating this? /s

Is that the same Fortress that just offered to buy Mt. Gox coins at $900?
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:17:19
Good one!

It is a 1 year old video. Had you seen it? IF not, then quit your bitching and try to see the point of it.
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:16:49
Logical fallacy much?

@_date: 2019-07-24 07:23:54
Your skipping over the message. This is not about Glenn Beck, this is about his guest. Look at what his guest is saying. Imagine if George Washington spoke to Stalin (on his Youtube channel) and that video was released, would you not listen to Washington because of Stalin?
As J. Krishnamurti many times said "See the truth in the False." - at the very least.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:51:20
Hey, I wasn't sure about the guy at first. He does some things (e.g. language used) that make me scratch my head. And then he goes and turns the economy around and comes up with sound economic policy based on years of business experience and not politics. I can appreciate that.
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:18:16
Listen to the guest. Get over your problems with who's show it is. The guest gives plenty of evidence, focus on that. IOW - It's the message, not the messenger.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:42:10
What is going to go up more, the amount owed on your student loans, or the price of Bitcoin?
I would have definitely payed minimum payments on something with a e.g. 5% yearly rate, vs. Bitcoin that goes up 10X per year.
I see cheerleading for your decision, but it was a psychological one, not a monetary one.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:43:36
Does it matter? He sold an asset going up 10X per year, to pay off debt that goes up 5% per year. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:12
Had you bought Bitcoin at anytime since its inception (up to a few days ago), you would be in profit. Rinse and Repeat. This will be the ride until we are over 100,000 USD imo, then perhaps we have long term "stability".
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:45:54
Trump is turning this economy around. His tax cuts are going to make it go wild, and they will help everyone. Money is going to come back into the country, more people will be hired.
Yeah, the rich might be richer, but so will ALL OF US!
I'm still looking for this so called corruption.
@_date: 2019-07-25 12:58:58
True. I have not come across as many scams and such in any other "branch" of life, not even regular investments. I always saw it as "With higher rewards come higher risks."
From Mt. Gox, to wallet hacks, fake ICOS, miners not delivering or being scams, etc.
I think any of us in here long enough, either sent crypto to a wrong address or can check off a few boxes above, lol. If not to bad, it is honestly like a souvenir, stories to tell decades on. I have a few.
Take care
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:25:40
I imagine you are talking about the stock market crash. Do you want to compare current digital cryptographic money with inflated 1920's money? Not sure I understand you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:05:40
Are you also in the Tea Party? I'm sure this is all going to make the IRS that much more loved.

I agree with this man. Instead of buying Lambo's, take the Satoshi vision and help to change the world. Keep a bit for yourself, be rewarded, but let's fix this.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:42:43
I hear you. Markets can be tough. But understand, Bitcoin and these cryptos are nothing like markets have ever seen.
With respect, .5 bitcoin is not a huge amount of money NOW. But, in 5 years, it can be the difference in your life. Paying off $5,000 in loans, most likely is not going to greatly affect you life. But selling Bitcoin now...
Good luck regardless
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:02:38
lol, Obama created a lot of part time work. Obama created Obama care, using profits from private corps to help pay for it. Obama supplied ISIS and the Syrian rebels with money and weapons to fight Assad. Luckily Trump and Putin ended that.
8 years of 1.5% to a high of 3% growth for Obama. Trumps first year is over 3.1%. 
Nice try, but Obama was destroying our country. But I will say he is a good talker.
Trump taking a few million and turning it into Billions, not bad.
Wait till those tax cuts come. Wait till more regulations stifling growth come. Wait till we kill more of this globalization crap. 
Prosperity is coming, enjoy it. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:42:55
Don't do it, look at my post below.
@_date: 2018-08-07 07:58:11
7 tps is NOT a currency, not yet anyway. 
It is too volatile right now also. We need the price to be much higher as well to transfer more wealth.
Do you even know what you are talking about, and this is coming from a huge BTC proponent.
@_date: 2018-08-07 09:39:43
Oh, I see what you meant.
And, look at their point - (The banks are inflating the money supply and we in a catch 22. This level of deficit spending was mainly done by the last two presidents. It continues now and will require a reset. Though, correcting trade imbalances might prolong or even stop the coming economic collapse) How to protect your money? Gold, silver and digital version of them? ;-)  Much more flexible. To then be able to use that store of wealth (high tsp) is very nice, and gets back to what money was to begin with.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:23:47
As a currency, store of value, way of securing other blockchains, storing important data, etc. yeah.
But there will lots of space for other so called protocol type coins. E.g. Neo, application coins, etc.
Putting all our eggs in one basket is dangerous.

@_date: 2018-08-05 18:50:31
Define adoption. If more people have Bitcoin (even if in a 401k) that is a form of adoption.
I don't agree with storing it that way, but it is going to be a first step for many "investors".
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:19:57
Well, it would slow down adoption to the more normies I suppose.

They can‘t be this stupid though. So, what are they really doing???

Twitters best days, like youtube and the other biggies, are behind them. They are now social engineering sites. The censorship is blatant.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:28:52
As I said, I was looking on Bitstamp, but that is a large exchange. I wonder about the other exchanges as a whole though. munche mentioned it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:27:07
Wouldn't buying at Local Bitcoins be, potentially, very dangerous - potentially for all parties involved and then some.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:31:25
Fair point, things are changing but even with the huge increase in price, you can't just buy bitcoin as in the past. People are clearly holding coins.
Your last question is good, hopefully someone that knows jumps in. Maybe Munchee's chart (posted above) has this info? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:59:43
Ah, I thought it was in person meetings. That would have obvious dangers.
Doing it online, well, I imagine they can look for larger sellers to get the sellers name, then work from there. True with higher transactions though, that does add a huge amount of protection. And I wonder about government stings (if they are busting people due to gray area legality) or squeezing people. I hope this doesn't happen, but as the value continues to go up, people with a few thousand dollars in Bitcoin, might go up there on the income scale. The rewards are rising, for all parties.
Also, be careful of anything via those apps, that might try to get your data and hence name/location. I'm just throwing it out there. It is a good field to be paranoid in.
Be very careful. I'm sure you guys are using very good security, but as your net worth increases, that has to go up with it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:29:52
I am aware Bitstamp has shrunk. But thanks for that link!
The buy side is way more than the sell, and that is just what we can see.
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:39:58
Wonder if they‘ve done any handwriting analysis between the two? Or Satoshi and the other gentlemen who was Faketoshi‘s business partner.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:52:15
Safe to say that we will probably see moves up in the next bull, that are bigger than the size of two bulls ago, maybe as big as this last one. For sure 50% / 10k is in the cards
Regarding your last paragraph, well put and Interesting that people are seeing this as Real money, like digital gold. We indeed will hit a time, perhaps transatory, where bitcoins will be the measure.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:47:31
The market buy moved the price from just over 4100 to just under 5100.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:43:50
I think institutions don't exactly want to tip their hands. I mean, it looks like we are at a bottom. I did my last selling at 6500. At 3100 things looked good but then when EVERYONE was saying, The Bottom is 1,000 to 2,500, that just sounded too favorable to EVERYONE. So, bought back in at 3500. lol
When we see larger dumps bouncing right back and huge buys holding, it makes you confident the bear is done. Might take us some time, perhaps we see another dip to 4200, but I think the institutions are going to start dipping their toes more.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:43:41
Really? Wow, that is very interesting. Dumping bitcoins these days doesn‘t move the price down as much as buying bitcoins do.
Love that plural use.
Demand steadily increasing.

What are you talking about? 2 months later you mention this in a thread about Judging BTC's price?
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:02:17
Instantly? As if this wasn‘t in the works for months...
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:05:58
"Stable coins" came after crypto coins though. And they are pegged to an inflationary money. They are only stable relative to a govt. controlled/mandated FIAT. 
Stable - is a very relative term. Digital gold is sort of clear and like gold, it has those benefits, but wait, there is more!!!
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:02:11
Sort of obvious, but what about all the lost coins? Most estimates I see is that they are in the million, perhaps 3 or 4. Should this be integrated here? Seems so.
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:07:21
Great news. We have what is left of globalization, and that is, in part, the interlocked banking system. If countries try to delay crypto (and they are), then enter smaller, more intelligent countries using these banking „relationships“. 
Get on board or get lost....

A bit of "philosophy" - Meaning that even if you do what is right, perhaps the virtual reality program you are running, does not have what you want in mind. It has what you need in mind. So, shoot for the middle.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:09:54
I‘ve done it before. It is only fair for others to experience it.
Then you will start to understand Reality is a Virtual Reality.

Something about HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS for DRUG MONEY LAUNDERING? They even set up the money drop boxes customly for the drug cartels. Nothing happened to them as the Government said they were too big to be prosecuted as it would weaken trust in the banking system.
Can't wait to be done with this corruption. Hangings?
