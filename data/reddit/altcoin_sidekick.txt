It comes as no surprise that growth of Lightning Network has been increasing. Zebpay also becomes the first cryptocurrency exchange to launch Bitcoin Lightning Network. The customers will now be able to make 10 transactions in a day with amounts as low as 1 Satoshi. However, the maximum permitted transaction value is 0.001 BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:19:25
yes, it is measured in USD but I think it won't be in the near future.
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:28:41

It comes as no surprise Bitcoin has proved itself decentralized enough to resist the takeovers by the largest wallet software, miners, and exchanges in the industry. No other cryptocurrency has faced test up to this point.
We know the history of Bitcoin that has separated Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies. But have you ever wondered about the history of money: from gold to cryptocurrency?
I found this is an informative source, [ you can read it and find the answer.

I agree with you, but there are still some beginners who are dablling with Bitcoin and other cryptocureencies.
I hope this post will help them. :)
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:12:47
I agree. But, this statement can definitely be answered in the word 'Yes.'

Thank You!
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:55:24
Agreed. Both are developing and gaining popularity at a fast pace, and we can probably see them as the future of their respective fields.
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:29:05

Undoubtedly, it'd be a default payment method. In fact, it has already been accepted on some platforms.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:18:31
Yes, it will surely be.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:11:48
Yes, no one can predict the timeframe it'd happen in. We can just hope it'd be a reserve currency.
@_date: 2019-04-22 08:01:41
Yes, Fiat isn't decentralized. Probably this'd be the main reason behind the growth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-27 06:25:57
Yes. We are hoping it too.

True!! It is high time now that we understand the the cryptocurrencies and its transactions.
@_date: 2019-04-22 08:03:26
Totally!! It'd definitely be one of the reserve currencies.
@_date: 2019-04-22 08:02:42
Yes, but let's just hope it turns out to be accurate.
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:51:27
Yes, but considering the current situation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in mind, bitcoin will surely be one of the reserve currencies, if not the only reserve currency.
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:31:41
I have shared it just to show as an example on how to buy goods with Bitcoin. There are many other wallets such as BTC.com, Copay, Edge, Electrum, Mycelium, Bitcoin.com, Bitcoin Core, Bitnovo, and BRD that can be used for the purpose.
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:53:40
Yes, probably and so can bitcoin be the future of currencies.
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:29:30
Thanks for sharing more insights on the same.
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:59:40
But, with the emerging technology, humans have certainly gained more insight into the blockchain and improved at making predictions. This being said, there'd probably be a huge possibility of bitcoin becoming a reserve currency of the world in the near future.

bitcoin is like the internet, enabling other coins to build on top of it

You are right!!

Thanks! Will surely give it a try :)
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:50:04
I agree with you. Although, it is still in the infancy stages, but it is sure to grow and have mainstream adoption.

Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:02:32
Yes, we can just hope this will happen at some point.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:09:54
Yes, government can surely help in the mass adoption of BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:08:56
But, don't you think these countries are too scared to adopt Bitcoin? They are already not economically settled.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:01:34
True!! Not everyone is familiar with the benefits and how good it will be if there will be bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:03:23
Yes, fiat can't come to an end entirely. Government won't let this happen.
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:58:05
That is a long way to go as well. Majority of people still doesn't know about blockchain or bitcoin. But yes once that happen we can surely see the mass adoption of bitcoin.

Thank You!!
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:01:43
Yes, it sure is.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:11:15
You have surely made you point. And, I agree. All these things are really affecting the mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-23 06:48:25
Do we really need more than one hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:06:42
Exactly. Bitcoin has gone from $3K to $8K in the last three months. And, we can't say if it will always be like this. Majority of people can't put their trust into this kind of volatility.
