The proposed tax reform leaves long-term capital gains tax rates exactly as they are now, so if your income stays the same next year, you will pay the same amount of taxes either way.
However, if you wait until January, you won't have to pay those taxes until April 2019, vs. April 2018 if you sold this December.

He's right. Being fixed at a permanent supply of 21 million, it is very deflationary (not only does it not keep up with GDP growth, it doesn't grow **at all**). For this reason alone, it will never become a day-to-day currency. It is much better suited as a long-term store of value and inflation hedge.

A lot of confusion in the way you asked your question. Let me try to clear some things up.
There is no such thing as "your private key". There are private keys (secret numbers) that can be used to gain access to funds stored on their associated public addresses.
First, almost all users will have more than one private key associated with their wallet. You will have one private key associated with each of your addresses.
Second, since it's just a piece of information (literally a number) and can theoretically be known to anyone and stored anywhere, it's not exactly "yours". Anyone who can access the private key can access the coins.
When you send bitcoin to a new wallet or new address, you will need to use the new address's associated private key in order to spend that money again in the future. Every address can only be unlocked by its own private key.

@_date: 2017-08-05 17:09:42
I don't think that all inflation is moral. I only disagreed that inflation is necessarily inherently immoral. For example, the current 2% inflation rate in the US is perfectly acceptable to me.
The government has a moral responsibility to manage the money supply in the best interests of the population. A small amount of inflation is an acceptable cost for stability.
If it became widely used, Bitcoin would be a deflationary currency (same as gold) and far less stable than the US dollar, because there would be no way of controlling the money supply to react to changes in the amount of economic activity. It would also do nothing to prevent the use of debt-based financing; it would just be denominated in Bitcoins instead of dollars.

The increase in prices (i.e., inflation) since 2007 has been **dramatically** (not "somewhat") lower than the increase in the money supply. This is not because of increased productivity, but because of the plummeting velocity of money.

Inflating a currency is not the same thing as defaulting on a debt. Everyone who buys a bond (hopefully) already knows that inflation is a risk of holding debt. That risk is already priced into the market. If you don't want to accept that risk, the US government has a special program created just for you called TIPS, which are bonds whose yield is pegged to the inflation rate.
So you think inflation is inherently immoral. I disagree, but for the sake of argument... Do you think that the value of a fiat currency should remain absolutely stable, or is deflation allowed?
You are free to hold as much or as little dollars and bonds as you wish. If you think inflation is evil, then nobody is stopping you from holding your savings in gold, commodities futures, stocks, etc.

You are mostly right, but strictly speaking, there can still be a good reason to buy something immediately with a deflationary currency.
If the currency is deflating at a rate of X%, and you can buy a productive asset (such as a piece of equipment for your business) or service (such as tuition for a class that will increase your salary) that will earn you a profit of Y%, then you're better off buying it immediately when Y &gt; X.
For non-productive (consumption) goods, yeah, it's harder to justify buying it immediately vs. waiting a bit longer for your currency to deflate even more.

The real answer is that your concern is correct: it is a real problem. With a permanent, fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin can never become a popular global currency for day-to-day transactions. It is far too deflationary and unstable for that.
Bitcoin serves a role much closer to gold (and Paypal) than a real currency. I expect it will be used for (1) a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation, and (2) an instant payment processing/clearing network for fiat currencies.

For some reason, I feel the need to step in here. You sound like you're throwing around some recently-learned bullet points from an undergrad stats lecture as if you're an expert.
First of all, "odds" are a way of expressing probability, which is related to, but different from statistics. Probability is primarily concerned with predicting future events, while statistics is primarily concerned with inferring how past events happened. So you actually sound a bit misinformed in your argument against about the usage of the word "odds" (even though it appears you were the first to use it) when describing the likelihood of a future event.
Secondly, you actually *can* quantify uncertainty (or "degree of belief") about future, individual, unrepeatable events. For example, there were very precisely-quantified odds on the recent Floyd Mayweather fight.
You sound like you're arguing an extreme frequentist point of view that no well-intentioned person knowledgeable about statistics and probability would actually defend.
If you don't know about Bayesian statistics, go read about it. If you do, then you're being deliberately obstinate.

and you are both slightly confused about the definition of inflation. Inflation is not a measure of the increase in the amount of currency available (that is called "money supply"); it is a measure of the price of goods denominated in that currency.
So although the number of Bitcoins is currently increasing, it is definitely not undergoing inflation, because its value has been skyrocketing for years. It is massively deflationary.

Read the linked pages for more information, but the gist is that sidechains allow people to shuffle some Bitcoin into their own private blockchain and transact on that.

Inflation is not the same thing as debt default, theft, or appropriation. Inflation does not change the number of dollars you hold. It changes the value of those dollars when measured against other valuable items. Some amount of inflation/deflation is completely unavoidable in every possible currency (fiat, gold, crypto, or otherwise) because the supply and demand of things in the world change over time.
Morality is subjective. I'm not projecting my views onto anyone (hence why I said "to me" above), but it sounds like you are:


If you live under the delusion that it is possible to maintain a currency that has a perfectly stable value over time, then you will eventually be disappointed by reality. Bitcoin may not be inflationary, but it is deflationary, and that's arguably even worse. Using your own words, it would be "theft" against the people who *don't* hold a majority of their savings in Bitcoin.
To maintain relative stability in the value of money, its supply and demand absolutely *do* need to be controlled. This is why the Federal Reserve exists. Otherwise you would see rampant deflation during economic expansions, and rampant inflation during economic recessions. Controlling money helps to smooth out the business cycle.

This is not the full story: when money is created through lending, the bank simultaneously creates an IOU (deposit account) for $A and an obligation to be paid back $B in the future, where B &gt; A. If you account for those obligations for customers to repay their loans, then the bank actually has a surplus. Some of those debts will not be repaid, but in aggregate the bank comes out ahead.


Not true. They can also keep their promise by being repaid their loans (see above), and by earning money through fees and interest, which they do.

It depends if you're talking about gold as strictly a store of value, or also as an industrial metal.
As an industrial metal, gold can have scarcity, because a fixed physical quantity of it is necessary to achieve a specific function. There is an existing demand for a specific physical quantity of it, measurable in ounces (or tons, more likely).
Speaking of it as a store of value, and ignoring the immense difficulty of measuring, storing, and transmitting microscopic fractions of gold, then gold has no economic "scarcity", because there is no demand for any particular fixed quantity of it. We could theoretically make due with any total quantity of gold, because the financial value of any quantity of gold can grow without bound. In fact, we would probably be better off, because then you could store your wealth more compactly in terms of the size and weight of your gold. Bitcoin is the same in this regard, but it is far easier to measure, store, and transmit tiny quantities of Bitcoin than gold.

That's not how scarcity works. Divisible currencies can't be objectively scarce or plentiful because they have no inherent physical properties like pizza does, so the total quantity in existence is completely meaningless. If the Bitcoin cap were 210 million instead of 21 million, it would make absolutely no difference to its "scarcity". Each one would just be worth 10x less.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:12:48
We seem to be talking past each other. Let me try again... It would probably also be helpful if you could describe a situation in which you would consider Bitcoin to be scarce, vs. another situation in which you would consider Bitcoin to be not scarce.
Divisibility is a red herring; ignore it. All digital currencies (including electronic dollars) are theoretically infinitely divisible because there is no smallest number, and representing ever-smaller numbers is just a basic programming exercise.
Getting back to the point of scarcity: physical commodities like food and water can be scarce because people need a fixed physical quantity of them to survive. When supply fails to meet demand, that is scarcity.
Digital currencies like Bitcoin cannot be "scarce" because they have no physical properties and no meaningful units with which to measure their quantity. The amount of Bitcoin in existence is simply a meaningless, abstract, made-up number.
It's more useful to think of a given quantity of Bitcoin in terms of the **percentage** of all 21 million coins that it represents, rather than the number of Bitcoins, millibits, satoshis, etc. From this perspective, the units you choose to denominate things with has no effect on the percentage of the currency that you have. It is the total market cap, and the percentage of it that you own, that is meaningful.
Hopefully then it becomes clear that it is impossible for a digital currency to be "scarce", because there is always precisely 1.000 Bitcoin Market Caps available, and it is always allocated to various people according to their percentage ownership.

That is a completely different situation than a shitcoin clone that is actually worthless. With this much money on the table, they can't simply keep it all for themselves because their Terms of Service says so. The law doesn't work that way. Regardless, if you've read their ToS, you'd see that it requires Coinbase to allow you to withdraw your BTC before a fork. Due to their withdrawal limits and shitty customer service, some of us are unable to withdraw our BTC by July 31.

For many reasons, it is simply not feasible to expect that 100% of Coinbase/GDAX customers will withdraw 100% of their BTC by August 1. I feel that those that remain invested are morally entitled to their BCC if it has significant value.

I don't think you can simply say "BTC is a commodity. Commodities don't produce dividends. End of argument." Nothing quite like Bitcoin has ever existed, so our traditional definitions don't exactly apply in every scenario.
I think that whether or not 1 BCC is considered a dividend (of sorts) of each BTC is up for legal debate. Morally, the answer is crystal clear to me: the BCC should belong to the customers. If BCC becomes valuable and it is not eventually distributed to Coinbase/GDAX's customers, I certainly expect this question to be decided in US Federal court.

Would you like to enlighten me about how I should have purchased Bitcoin last month, if not through a regulated, US-based exchange? Was that really such a mistake?

I would love to remove my coins, but due to their withdrawal limits and absolutely horrible (non-existent) customer service, I don't expect to be able to do so by July 31.
I understand your argument that I only have an IOU for 1 BTC, not 1 BCC. But consider an analogy where you own 1 share of stock held by a brokerage. If that company issues a dividend in the form of 1 share of a spinoff company, your broker is legally obligated to process that dividend share and allow you to withdraw it. I don't see BCC as different enough from that scenario to allow Coinbase to sell, keep, or destroy the BCC that ought to belong to its customers.

I don't give a shit whether you believe that I read the FAQ. Trying to argue about it comes across as really childish.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:52:00
For BCC in particular, it looks like it will actually be quite easy to support. All BTC private keys are also valid BCC private keys, so there's very little they actually need to do except claim the coins and attribute them correctly to their customers.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:55:29
Not enough notice for me to withdraw my BTC in time.
I agree that random worthless forks shouldn't be supported. But if BCC becomes very valuable (it currently appears to be worth 20% of BTC) then it should be supported.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:19:36
I would think so, but just wanted to confirm.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:08:16


Except that GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) has withdrawal limits for BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:43:50
I agree with your reasoning. I think they should be expected, both practically and legally, to support withdrawals for forks of currencies they already support where the fork's market value is above some threshold. The exact threshold is debatable, but clearly it is somewhere above $0.000001 but below 20% of Bitcoin's current market value, which is what it looks like BCC is currently worth.
Due to their absolutely horrible customer service, I will not be able to withdraw my coins by July 31. I hope that their announcement was designed to simply dissuade people from joining the hard fork, and that when the time comes, they will do the right thing and allow us to withdraw our BCC (if it has value).
Clearly, Coinbase/GDAX isn't going to hold 0 Bitcoins on August 1, so expecting literally every customer to move their coins to their own wallet is just not feasible.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:37:07

I agree you should be able to, but you aren't. I have a lot of BTC on GDAX that are stuck there beyond August 1.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:13:39
There is a daily limit on withdrawing BTC from GDAX, which is the Coinbase exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:23:12
If BCC becomes worth billions of dollars, then whether or not it is a delusion will be decided by a US federal court.
Giving me advance warning doesn't help when I am unable to withdraw by July 31. Once again, their ToS actually requires Coinbase to give customers the opportunity to withdraw before a fork.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:57:45
Just because Coinbase says that they will do something doesn't guarantee that they will.
In my post, I was trying to outline all possibilities, regardless of whether or not Coinbase keeps their word.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:43:25
Everything I said is under the assumption that the new coins become significantly valuable, e.g. 20% of the current value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:46:44
If they do (2), then I expect the US federal court system to decide whether or not it is theft.
If you fork a coin that is worth $0.01, then nobody will reasonably expect them to support such a worthless coin, and suing them will cost more than you would get out of it. My entire discussion is under the assumption that Bitcoin Cash becomes significantly valuable. It is currently trading for around $545. That is a very different discussion than your hypothetical $0.01 coin.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:50:07
Link to the interview?
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:59:12
I agree with you 100%. I am trying to withdraw everything from GDAX because I hate how Coinbase has handled this whole situation, but GDAX has withdrawal limits. It will take me longer than August 1 to completely pull out. Because they haven't given me any way to liquidate, I feel entitled to receive any BCC that they get access to because of my BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:32:03
This is the thing... If Bitcoin wants to scale on-chain to handle as many transactions as Visa etc., it will *necessarily* be centralized. It's massively inefficient for every single node to verify every single transaction and impractical for everyone but extremely well-funded companies.
The only way I can see a decentralized payment network that can handle a Visa-like transaction count is through mass adoption of the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:15:46
Oh, I didn't realize it would be longer than 24 hours. That's crazy!
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:19:25
I don't see your point... No, 2MB SegWit2x would not require a mega data center, but it also won't scale to handle Visa-like transaction volumes on-chain.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:59:28
I wanted to buy a lot of Bitcoin last month. At the time, I didn't realize the BCC hard fork was a certainty. I thought SegWit2x was going to prevent that from happening.
If BCC becomes valuable, I want to be able to claim it for myself.
I'm honestly curious: what do you think I should have done differently?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:52:09
You recommend withdrawing our BTC before July 31, but GDAX's withdrawal limits prevent us from doing that. Can you please temporarily waive BTC withdrawal limits until August 1?
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:48:29
I agree. I have lost a lot of faith in them because of this issue.
I would welcome a truly decentralized exchange.

I bought BTC on GDAX before I was aware of the BCC hard fork, and before it was widely known. If BCC becomes highly valuable, then GDAX will have a moral and legal obligation to allow their customers to claim their BCC.
What if BCC gains more than 50% of the hashrate and becomes the new Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:11:52
Some people don't want SegWit and/or don't trust people to honor the "2x" part of the SegWit2x agreement. They are free to create a new hardfork, as is anyone else at any time.

I still don't understand what little point of syntax you're trying to make. I simply outlined 4 possible scenarios. I assure you that I read their FAQ. Can you just accept that on good faith? This is turning into a complete clusterfuck.
I can't withdraw my BTC by July 31 because GDAX has withdrawal limits.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:28:56
I'm not sure what lesson you think I should be learning here.
I bought BTC from an exchange (do you think that was a mistake?), and I am trying to move it to my own wallet. It turns out that BTC is about to have a "dividend" of sorts during the time when the exchange holds my BTC. I want access to that dividend.
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:52:04
Ah, sadly not. It can only be sorted by the private key.
I think they're working on that for version 2.0.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:50:43
You have stumbled upon Bitcoin's fatal weakness. In fact, [this website]( lists **all** Bitcoin private keys! You can simply look them up!
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:25:10
Can you clarify this statement from  which implies that replay protection is automatic?


@_date: 2017-07-29 19:20:52
"Reputable" is relative. It's a gamble... Plenty of people have lost a lot of money when various exchanges have been hacked or shut down.
I would recommend minimizing the length of time you keep coins on any exchange. If you don't own the private keys, you don't technically own the coins.
You can choose to trust an exchange to split your coins for you, if they have announced they will do that, but I think it's still somewhat risky.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:50:11
Due to GDAX's withdrawal limit, that will take me until after August 1.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:44:20
I didn't realize there are already a dozen+ alts that have "Bitcoin" in their name. Pretty interesting, thanks. This gives me hope.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:12:21
No need to act childish.
This is different from what you describe because: (1) We know about it in advance, (2) Coinbase has already announced that they are shutting down all transactions starting on July 31, and (3) The fork already seems to be highly valuable.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:12:15
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:11:08
Thanks, I understand the difference very well already. I was using it as an analogy: in both cases, a brokerage is holding an asset for you that produces a valuable "dividend" of sorts.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:14:25
Yeah, the limit applies to the sum total value of all withdrawals.
Thanks for the suggestions.

I'm impressed. Good for you.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:27:12
I don't understand how Coinbase can flat-out say "we won't support it".
The fact of the matter is that unless BCC goes to $0, there WILL exist private keys under their control that are worth some amount of money -- possibly a LOT of money.
I only see four options: (1) Coinbase/GDAX allows users to withdraw 1 BCC for each BTC they hold, (2) They keep the BCC for themselves or sell it for profit, (3) They never touch the BCC, and (4) They destroy their BCC by sending it all to an invalid address.
(2) is outright theft and will almost certainly lead to a class-action lawsuit. (3) and (4) are basically the same from the customers' perspective: all of that value is either locked away forever or destroyed.
If BCC is worth any non-negligible amount of money, then Coinbase will be in serious legal trouble unless they allow customers to withdraw their BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:02:42

@_date: 2017-07-24 04:46:47
Due to GDAX's withdrawal limits and absolutely horrible customer service, it is simply not possible for everyone to withdraw their coins by July 31.
It looks like some of us are screwed. Move your coins out of Coinbase/GDAX by July 31 if you're able to.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:12:27

@_date: 2017-07-24 13:18:16
To clarify: "Coinbase would make those coins available for customers to withdraw", which you quoted, is equivalent to number (1) in my original comment. I honestly don't understand the point you're trying to make in order to prove that I didn't read the FAQ. Seems pretty ridiculous to try to convince me that I didn't read what I read.


I just want to eventually be able to withdraw my BCC from Coinbase, if they become valuable. I don't care if it takes a month, if that is what it requires to make sure their withdrawal system is reliable (although that seems far-fetched, given that it's really not that complicated). Coinbase is the only exchange that has made the astonishing statement that they don't intend to allow their customers to withdraw their BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:24:15
It is the nature of open-source software that anyone can create a copy (fork) and modify it whenever they want. That doesn't make it fragile; on the contrary, it means that people are always free to explore the space of possibilities and converge on the best one.
This particular fork is the culmination of years of debate about the best way to make Bitcoin scale to a larger number of users and transactions. The two coins are pursuing different philosophies and methods for accomplishing that. This is similar to the way in which animals evolve over time and natural selection tends to favor the fittest individuals.
There are also some people who believe that other people are actively trying to destroy or cripple Bitcoin, but I haven't seen any convincing evidence of that.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:18:36


Seems fishy...
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:26:17
First of all, it's not very time-consuming. If you understand how the hard fork works, then you know it's no more complicated than simply creating a BTC transaction, but with a different protocol that is already published and available online. Coinbase has already done this exact same thing with Ethereum Classic ([source](
Second, if BCC remains 20% as valuable as BTC (which it is right now), then we're talking about many millions of dollars of value. They will not be able to keep, lock up, or destroy all of that value without getting sued into oblivion.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:27:16
I really hope it fails. Having two different versions of bitcoin would set us back years in terms of mass adoption.

Why are you being an asshole? I *did* read their FAQ post. What makes you think I didn't? I already covered the case you quoted as number (1) in my comment above. 


I am not missing anything about the situation. I understand it requires effort to allow people to withdraw their BCC. But if it ends up being significantly valuable (it currently seems to be trading for 20% the price of BTC, and could go higher post-fork), then that is an enormous amount of value being left on the table.
What if BCC gains more than 50% of the hashrate and becomes the new Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:38:28

The risk to the miners is that it won't be as profitable as continuing to mine on the main chain. There are many ways that could happen, but two possibilities are:
1. Other miners conduct a 51% attack on the HF coin, if they perceive it to be a threat. If the HF coin has very low hashrate, this could be relatively cheap for the attackers.
2. The HF coin becomes worthless and abandoned.

No, I don't. With ETC, they gave their customers a window of opportunity to withdraw their ETC. The fact that they eventually ended that opportunity doesn't seem relevant at all to the discussion. What point are you trying to make, exactly?
