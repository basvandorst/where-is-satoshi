I think this is the screen recording of the tests :)

yes, they're still only hashing on (nonce + client_id + api_key). Since SSL is fixed, they're no longer vulnerable. 


@_date: 2014-04-08 14:34:13
Normally the point of using signatures is to make sure that the owner is the actual author of the request. But since the signature calculation does not include the actual Payload (message/intent), anybody that intercepts the original request, can simply replace the Payload, without having to re-calculate the signature, hence the server wouldn't know that the payload was actually hijacked.

Since the Bitstamp API is no longer vulnerable (SSL was updated), this is the **actual disclosure** :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:24:46
well said
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:55:28
The attack only works as a MITM attack, due to the nounce invalidation (once used it's no longer valid, and to use another nounce you need to calculate the signature again), so it's unusable for COMPLETED requests.

Looks like it's been down for about 2h. Tried refreshing the page and it came back. Then switched the language to English, and it went back down. Might be just network issues.

Call me narrow minded all you want, but until those solutions are in place, you'd have to be insane to pay $10k for a crypto coin when there are countless other stable &amp; secure crypto coins. IMHO.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:03:24
Say that to me when the cost of producing a dollar bill reaches 2000 to 5000 USD (current estimated production cost for one Bitcoin). Most other crypto coins are free, open-source, borderless and safe. Why would somebody pay $10K for a crypto coin when they can pay $0.00xx for another coin that's even more useful for transacting (take etherium for example - you don't need to wait 30 minutes for 3 confirmations on every transaction - this is just one example!)?

Since the probability of an imminent crash has risen to over 80%, I think you should do whatever you feel more comfortable doing. If you think it'll rise further, then HODL, if not, sell/short. Either way, this is not the best place to get balanced advice on investing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:50:37
This is EXACTLY my feeling!! I've been saying this for a while now, and not because of lack of information. I'm intimately familiar with the blockchain protocol and the Bitcoin implementation (helped build the largest BTC exchange in my country). Yet when I started thinking about the whole Bitcoin idea, I've reached to the exact same conclusions as you: Bitcoin is a nasty religious black hole that's supported by ignorance and greed.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:30:26
For YOUR volume: yes. Since we're talking about .5 BTC it won't drive the market down.
For larger volumes (&gt;50) we need to be thoughtful about the market. In which case I would recommend cutting a deal with somebody that wants to buy that amount of BTC, and posting a hidden order at an established price (as close to the current market value as possible), and filling that order with the amount you'd want to sell. Again, we should all act responsibly even when trading.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:36:01
Definitely. It might even work on BTC exchanges with low volumes during flash crashes. I've seen it happen :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:42:35
I think the mistake here was that he bought it at the peak of the bubble. A few months earlier and he wouldn't have anything to worry about. But then again, that's how crypto-markets work. As with any digital asset, there will be bubbles and corrections. The smartest thing is to watch it for a longer period and buy in after a big correction, when the market stabilizes. In this case, I personally believe it would stabilize somewhere around $1k-$2k and then move upward from there. But again, this is just speculation - don't make anything of it :).
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:19:09
Because nobody can really know how big the dip will be nor when it will start going up again.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:59:32
$3.3K is not cheap. 300% increase over the production cost isn't cheap to me...
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:07:45
Is this a prophecy? We're not yet in the 9th year of Satoshi (that would be 2018). 
The current block number is 486074. Assuming one block gets mined every 10 minutes, this would put the story at around the middle of August 2020. 
Still very entertaining nevertheless :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:03:02
Most exchanges these days are full of bots. Some bots actively monitor the trading offers (long/short). So if someone would put up a long for 1000 BTC, the bots would immediately react and start buying(so they don't get left behind), hence driving the market up. Same for short offers.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:35:21
I feel you bro... Be careful. There might be a bit of support at around $3800 - which means the price might go up a bit, just enough to sell it for a decent price. Then when it dips below that, you can buy back in if you feel it's a good investment.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:40:03
Don't bet your house on it. Please...

I find it fascinating how much bitcoin owners act like religious zealots. No matter how lovingly you explain to them that there's a big crash coming, they'll keep to their "hodl" religion. Please, for the love of God, BE WISE. I'm starting to see more and more posts saying how they are ruined. This just breaks my heart...

There are quite a few bots in most (if not all) crypto exchanges. They not only monitor the trades and order books, but they monitor other crypto trades &amp; books, twitter, news feeds, etc, in search for anomalies (machine learning). When enough monitored features deviate from the norm(standard deviation+variation), that would be considered an anomaly and using certain ML algorithms they would decide if they should sell or buy, irrespective of the currency.

Doesn't work like that :) If anybody places a sell order at $400, then the highest buy order will get executed($3500), then the second highest($3499), so on and so forth, until the entire amount is depleted. It's like you're dumping champagne on a pyramid of glasses. The top has to be filled before it goes to the second layer, and so on.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:58:21
You do realize that if your calculations are correct, about $139 millions worth of Bitcoin have also been sold, right? :)

JPMorgan didn't buy the "dip". His clients did, despite his warnings. Really not the same...
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:41:13
I see your point, but wouldn't complying and continuing with "Business as usual" be more profitable for the exchanges than simply closing the business? I find this very strange...

Bitfinex is based in Hong Kong, and I believe Hong Kong is sovereign, not under the control of China, so I probably wouldn't worry too much about it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:39:25
Hong Kong is independent of China. Has it's own separate government and financial markets. Hong Kong isn't affected by the Chinese "ban".

This is the kind of mentality that makes me feel sick to my stomach when I think about bitcoin trading and the greedy ruthlessness that comes with it. Why would you consider the ecosystem when you can just s$%t wherever you want, right?
I suggest you look into John Nash's Game Theory and see why it's better to also consider the ecosystem before you do stuff like that.

Don't forget that in case of a nuclear attack, most electronics would be fried by the EMP generated by the nuclear blast. Considering this, and the fact that the US is a MAJOR internet node, most BTC trading/mining would also break down, just like most other internet-related activities (assuming it's a localized attack on NK and US soils).
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:33:25
Why wouldn't they also control bitcoin? It's not like they don't have the funds to manipulate its value...

According to the "pattern" you've illustrated above, the next bubble should happen somewhere around 2026 AD. That's assuming we don't blow ourselves to kingdom come by then.

no, absolutely not. I'm willing to pay the extra just to get it in a nice package and get it shipped fast. But definitely not 300% extra...

I personally have become disgusted by the ruthless manipulation of the market prices, which is why I don't like Bitcoin at all. I find blockchain fascinating (for public services &amp; so on), but the currency itself IMHO is quite a sad application for it. And when I see the religiosity with which "hodlers" react when someone is trying to advice them on being conservative about investing their life savings into it, I can't help but feel saddened.

On the same thought, what's stopping a rogue nation from spinning up a powerful quantum computer whose mining power exceeds 51% of current total mining power and taking over the network? The answer is easy: nothing.
