Yeah she did look like she was going to cry at any moment. She was wrong and stupid, and I hope that she is learning something here, and I hope that the lessons rub off on the next 'investigative journalist' who is planning similar actions. But I think death threats are way too far. Did anyone actually give her a death threat?!?!?!

yeah I am sure that you could count a cop's or any bystander's testimony without a doubt. Only video counts.

he has been coding. so he could one day (now) stop all tanks with his math. just as he stops investigative journalists with his hand.

Question from the nosebleed seats here; When can we buy Ethereum? And will you still be offering 1000 Ethereum for 1BTC? Or a special early bird 2000 Ethereum for 1 BTC as I seem to remember reading on your website once? Or has the enthusiasm and obvious demand for Ethereum made you think of a lower BTC/Ethereum conversion rate more favorable to the project?

Open Transactions?

Balaji's use of "Voice or Exit" instead of "Fight or Flight" is meaningful and I concur with everything he said. Soft spoken doers like Balaji are changing this world for the better.
