Buying $4 of bitcoin costs more than $400 of labor/effort? 
Isn't this product intended for bitcoin developers who, you know, probably already own some bitcoin? Isn't buying $4 of bitcoin a relatively simple task for someone with the skill set to develop bitcoin applications?

Couldn't you make a new wallet to hold your testing satoshis, and just fill it with enough to last you indefinitely? Isn't a million satoshis like, what, four dollars? Compared to $400 (plus mining electricity) for your current setup?

Sure, and if your goal as a consumer is to support 21 Inc, that's fine. I'm sure that's why many people bought the device. I'm more curious about why a purely self-interested consumer would buy this device.


These things don't mine economically, right? (As in, are you getting more bitcoins out than the cost of the electricity?) And as far as I understand, there are no small, consumer-sized devices that mine economically these days? So besides taking advantage of free electricity in Starbucks, a consumer who has this device in their home is unlikely to financially profit over time by selling their spare satoshis, right?


Sure. As I said, it's a legitimate use case if you're specifically interesting in familiarizing yourself with 21 Inc hardware. As you can see, though, I'm skeptical of the overall concept behind 21 Inc, so I don't expect that knowledge to be worth $400.

How is it possible to buy this $400 computer anonymously, or in a developing country, but not bitcoins? 
Also, if you have an Internet connection and a regular computer, can't you just get free, relatively anonymous satoshis from a faucet?

I don't understand this. If it's economical in this hypothetical 21 Inc world to mine on a cell phone chip sized device, why not just cut out the middle man and have a dedicated consumer-sized device plugged into the wall, mining bitcoin all the time?

I don't want my debts to be upwardly volatile. A debt denominated in bitcoin would be quite perilous for one party or the other if there's volatility in either direction.

Ok, this seems like an actual use case. Buying this device can be justified if you *specifically* want to familiarize yourself with 21 Inc hardware in preparation for future 21 Inc hardware releases.
For software development, though, for 99% of potential applications of that idea, couldn't you do the testing by creating a wallet with a million satoshis and programming it to slowly release them?

One of the pieces of evidence in the DPR trial was a chat log of him discussing their policy of allowing cyanide to be bought and sold, despite its illegality and reputation as a poison.

Why would this scandal be any more successful than any other scandal in China? Information like what you describe is already out there, it's just that they already have the means to handle that sort of challenge. [Their existing filtering system]( could easily handle the task of ensuring that there won't be a massive viral scandal.
