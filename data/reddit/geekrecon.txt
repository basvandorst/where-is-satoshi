I am in the same boat. It hurts seeing this drop because just a few weeks ago we were flying high with the ATH. I’m kicking myself for not selling then and buying now. That’s just the way it rolls for those of us who HODL. I have no doubt that it will eventually rise again, so instead of panicking, I think the best thing to do is take advantage of this fire-sale... but that’s just me.

File this under because by this logic, the the current value of bitcoin would be $700,000. This is not true. The current bitcoin value is $2,735.59, which would equate to $13,677.95

Some people on these comments are saying that the value of a bitcoin was $700 back then, however, I found that the value of bitcoin in 2010 was $.08.... That means that if he paid for a pizza with 5000 bitcoins, assuming that the correct value was $.08, it would still be a $400 pizza.

There are still flaws with the article. First, Forbes never addressed the price of the bitcoin during the time of purchase of the pizza. Secondly, "Back in 2010, Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz talked someone into accepting the 10,000 Bitcoins he'd "mined" on his computer in exchange for two pizzas." -- the sign clearly states that they used 5,000 bitcoins to purchase "pizza". And we know now that in 2010, the price of bitcoin fluctuated between .04 to .08. It just doesn't add up.

So you are telling me that he bought a pizza with 5000 bitcoins?

I never took into account the social aspect of it and was so focused on the literal sense of it all. I can live with this reasoning. Well said. Thank you.

According to Wiki, the value of a bitcoin in 2010 was $.08, which we all know fluctuated. So, let's use your $.05 number -- that would be $250 for 2 pizzas. I'm still calling - who would spend $250 on 2 pizzas? The article you cited states that they spent 10,000 bitcoins which would be even worse! That means that it would have been $500 for 2 pizzas, but that's not what the sign said. It clearly said 5,000 bitcoins. 
.05 * 5,000 = $250
Where did you get $41

It wasn't so much the wrong tree. It was that the sign clearly said 5k bitcoins, but this event used 10k. I get the "real" event and why it happened. It was just a fact finding mission - I didn't expect so many people to rip me for it tho.
