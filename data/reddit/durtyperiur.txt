Do you have any experience in the ecommerce field? The people that do will have a huge leg up on you. I would look at combining bitcoin with whatever you are a specialist in. Or look for some specific untapped market in he ecommerce arena.

If I bought beanie babies at an all time high and now I have a bunch of worthless beanie babies in my closet does that mean I have unrealized losses?

How much money did you invest?

No. Pretty much anybody that is highly educated in economics or finance knew. Just look at the Twitters of Nouriel Roubini, Paul Krugman, etc...

I don’t have a magic ball. But I have a brain. And I read books. More than you can say than about 99% of the idiots on here.
