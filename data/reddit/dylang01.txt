Try paying for your McDonalds order in USD when you're in Aus/NZ/Canada/UK/Germany/France/China/Japan etc. 
USD isn't accepted in every country. Not by a long shot.

Maybe because it's not the most appropriate scale to view the most recent drop?

You can't make a graph and when people don't understand it or question it say that the people are wrong and not the graph. A graph is used to show something in a way that people can understand. If people are having trouble understanding the graph then that's an issue with the graph, not the people.

It's misleading. A normal person viewing the graph will assume a linear scale unless told otherwise and as the graph talks about drops in price, but the drops aren't on the same scale, you can't compare them with each other. 
The graph makes bitcoin look more stable in growth than it is and obfuscates the drops. 
The graph is misleading.

I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of a graph.

Ahh. You can't argue that this graph isn't misleading so now you're comparing it to something stupid in the hopes that people will see your stupidity and my comments and assume they're equally stupid. 
I guess I've won the argument then. Not that it's about winning. But, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

WTF kind of scale is this graph using.

No one in Aus is going to accept USD unless you're massively over paying for what you're buying.

It's because there's no regulations around bitcoin in Australia and banks are taking a very conservative approach with it due to money laundering fears. 
CommBank got into trouble for not reporting suspicious transactions recently, so WestPac are just playing it safe. Especially with the extra attention that the Banking Royal Commission will bring. 
Don't be annoyed at the banks. Be annoyed at the politicians who haven't put the regulations in place to allow banks to deal with Bitcoin.
