This new book by George Gilder tackles key questions about how monetarism distorts the economy and leads to misallocation of investment. Gilder covers a variety of topics, including Milton Friedman’s greatest “error,” money supply and velocity, the perils of high-volume trading, Bitcoin and how it mimics Gold, and why a Gold Standard is superior to targeting based on a basket of commodities.

Please educate yourself.
"The Classical Greek philosopher Plato discusses five types of regimes (Republic, Book VIII). They are Aristocracy, Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent Tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with Aristocracy at the top and Tyranny at the bottom."

The best alternative to "writing your passphrase on paper" is this:
1) Choose a Caesar cipher: the best known is rot13
but choose your own number, obviously!
2) Encode your passphrase to your cipher in lower case with no spaces
e.g. rot13(correct horse battery staple)
becomes pbeerpgubefronggrelfgncyr
(check it at 
3) Get an encrypted email account, like 
4) send your encrypted passphrase to your email account.
5) send a few cryptic reminders of your "Caesar number" and your email account passwords to a few other email accounts
More peace of mind than worrying about losing a piece of paper.

"The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane, intolerable."

I prefer "de-bamboozle", as Rothbard used it:
"The noble task of Revisionism is to de-bamboozle: to penetrate the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history of the motivation, the nature, and the consequences of State activity."
