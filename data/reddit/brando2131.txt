Yes, why? 
Because physical wallets are much better as the private keys never leave the wallet. Whereas computer/mobile wallets 'could' have the keys comprised though trojans, keyloggers, etc.
How creating transactions works, is the wallet program on the computer/phone creates the 'unsigned transaction' and sends it to your physical device, where the device asks you to confirm, and then 'signs' the transaction with the private key, it sends the 'signed transaction' back to the program. So the program that's on the computer/phone, at no point, ever needs to know your keys. 
Not even yourself can even get the seed back from the device, you need to write it down when you initialize the device. This is why they are better than digital wallets.

Then you're back to square one, where banks store your "gold" (bitcoin) and process payments for you, they'll take fees for storing and transferring this "gold", eventually nobody will be holding "gold" except banks. Then once they have all the "gold" they'll introduce QE and fractional reserve banking on this "gold". Sounds familiar?
With lightning network (LN) you'll have cheaper and instant bitcoin transactions, without giving up your "gold" you'll be able to send and receive your "gold" as easy as it is to send an email but with no payment processors required (unless you opt in for that). So LN gives you the option to be your own bank, with transactions that are cheaper and instant.

How can you you say it "was" dangerous, it had a large support of people and 80%+ of miners signalling for it, it only "became" dangerous once there was disagreement with the devs and people/miners dropped supporting it. If support continued amongst miners and devs, and everybody upgrading to it, we'd all be using B2X in the form of Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin segwit in the form of Bitcoin, and that would be ok, because there would be consensus, (just like if it happens in the future as a last resort, or a bound to happen resort).
That also means ANY attempt to directly increase the block size is also dangerous, because even if the bitcoin core devs agree to it, it will still be a hard-fork from the original consensus rules.
I don't think Bobby Lee should be saying it was extremely dangerous and irresponsible, because everyone is entitled to their vote on how bitcoin should progress, and not be left to only a few elite developers, as that's what a consensus is. And sure if the consensus turned out to later not be in favour of B2X, then we shouldn't of attempted to fork it, but hard forks are a necessary evil even with consensus.

We would soon bottleneck if there is another bullrun, even with segwit enabled.

That's not true, the first transaction is only spending 88,888 BTC, the remainder is most likely change/consolidation going back to the owner. The second transaction DOES appear in the top 3, it has the same transaction ID as the last one, again, they are not considering change as part of the transfer.

Electrum wallet allows you to connect a ledger or trezor, test that out first, and see if your transactions come up. It also allows you to connect to your own full node. 
On a server or desktop:
- Run a full bitcoin node
- Setup electrum personal server
On a desktop:
- Run electrum wallet and config it to connect to your electrum server
Alternatively you can run electrumX or electrs and that operates as an electrum server anyone can connect to, whereas the electrum personal server only indexes the wallets it's setup for.

Unfortunately not careful enough.
- This could have probably been easily prevented if you kept your software up to date. Depending on the system, turn on automatic updates and check it once a month that it's up to date. This would of prevented 0 day vulnerabilities and ransomware attacks that exploit security flaws in unpatched systems.
- Moving crypto to a new wallet after a security breach
- Or just simply using a hardware wallet.
Also VNC servers can be insecure and aren't encrypted by default, SSH with keys is much better if you don't need the GUI.

I think bitcoin can already be idiot proof, depending on what you use.
You already have exchange and web based wallets for the Kardashian's like blockchain.com, coinbase, and easy to use PoS like bitpay, which abstract away having to store a seed and offer help for forgotten password etc which is idiot proof. Obviously has its major down sides to cater the idiots. 
Then there's Blockstream's Green wallet which offers a very nice UX for iPhone and Android but does walk you though the seed process, which can be used by a layman.
Hardware wallets have also made it really easy, with the recent introduction of ledger live on desktop or mobile with the ledger nano X which has a really nice UX.
Gone are the days when you had no option but to run a full node, with no seed and had to constantly back up your wallet.dat file. Then electrum provided thin clients and seeds but you still had to be in front of a computer and had a complex UI.

"skipping unnecessary details, I have recently received 500 bitcoins."
I don't think you can say those two statements in the same sentence, because that's completely unnecessary �� Also what would of been necessary would be how you received the bitcoins, via inheriting an exchange account, seed, a device etc. But you just gave us the amount instead of saying "I've just inherited some bitcoin.."
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:41:33
Sorry this is just downright wrong.. 
A block on the blockchain only gets created about once every 10 mins. All the live transactions before being added to a block sits in a separate "mempool". There's nothing stopping a malicious user from broadcasting multiple transactions spending the same coin. 
If that transaction already exists in the blockchain, it will be instantly invalid and not propagated. However the transactions sitting in the mempool (not in the blockchain yet) are subject to a malicious user submitting that transaction again to someone else, both are unconfirmed or 0conf transactions.
A miner will collect up to 1MB worth of transactions from there own mempool, based on "highest fee first served" NOT on a "first come first serve" priority, as there business model is to maximize profit, thereby invalidating the other transaction once one of them is added to the blockchain.
Furthermore, I have tested this myself when I sent a very low fee transaction to my main wallet, which appeared unconfirmed for quite some time, it was an old wallet that didn't have RBF. So I was impatient and though it was bugged, used some tools to extract the key and manually build and rebroadcast the same transaction again to a different wallet address. Both transactions were now unconfirmed and when the higher fee transaction confirmed later, the old transaction just showed a "unknown txid" on a block explorer because they deleted it from there own mempool for being invalid now.
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:35:59
Buying bitcoin would be considered a "cash advance" so the interest free period wouldn't apply in this case. So you would have to pay a lot of interest on day one when you buy the bitcoin. It's the same if you tried to withdraw cash, gamble or buy gift cards with a credit card. Not all CCs are the same so different conditions may apply.
Also if you don't have the savings to buy it, then you're doing it wrong, if the economy happened to crash and you lost your job the next day, and bitcoin also happened to crash in the short term, then you'd be screwed.
Best option is use your CC for regular purchases, build a cash emergency fund, then invest any extras, if you want to invest your emergency fund too, then assess the risks, but never invest credit card debt. Hey even taking out a regular loan has better interest rates than credit card rates lol.

Storing it on an exchange = not your bitcoin, its a custodial account and they have full control and responsibility over it.
Storing it yourself = your bitcoin, you have full control and **responsibility** over it.
Yes that means you need to take good measures of backing up your wallet, knowing how to restore a backup, and doing a test restore. The benefit of that is total control over your bitcoin, no one can censor or reverse your transactions or confiscate your bitcoins (except without physical force)
The downsides to custodial accounts is they get hacked! Yes even bank accounts get hacked and information is leaked, but because bitcoin is like digital gold, once its hacked, it can never be reverted, but with banks, they can simply block the malicious transfer moving out, so banks getting hacked isn't such a big deal as when bitcoin exchanges get hacked. So use a hardware wallet.

You call it a shitcoin, except banks are scared shitless of libracoin. It has the ability to render the financial system almost useless if the billions of people using facebook start transacting with that instead of banks. A society with libracoin would be great, everyone could transact instantly and cheaply. For those that wish to keep there privacy and security with the expense of convenience, would move to bitcoin, thus increasing bitcoins popularity. Too bad it might be possible that the regulators might be able to stop libra, or regulate the shit out of it, but they've given up on stopping bitcoin, because they know its impossible.

There is a concept called UTXO (unspent transaction outputs), every time you receive bitcoins, you wallet holds onto the transaction ID of those outputs that were sent to you.
Regardless if they are sent to you as new addresses, or the same address, when spending, your wallet still has to reference the transactions that occurred in order to spend it. So if address 2 contains more transactions to reference when you spend it, it will take more bytes to have your transaction in the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-06-08 11:40:54
**ASIC resistance hurts decentralization.** 
Right now it's becoming a leveled playing field because ASICs is already well established. If you make it resistant for the current hardware, it may sound good, but someone will invest a lot in R&amp;D to develop new ASIC hardware to mine the ASIC resistant bitcoin and it won't be ASIC resistant anymore. This will be a monopoly for the first people to build the new hardware until everyone gets a chance to discover this new ASIC hardware. That means ASIC resistance only works if you keep updating the protocol every few months, and who is going to be the authority to decide what the new algorithm is going to be?
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:02:15
I think you are getting confused between addresses and wallets. Every time you send bitcoin to a wallet, it should generate a new bitcoin address, so addresses should never be reused for privacy reasons.
To answer the question, if you have 1 wallet that received 5 transactions and another wallet that received 2 transaction of the same value, then the second wallet will (probably) have cheaper transaction fees if you assume both wallets use segwit and have the same fee-per-byte set, because there is more data/bytes to transmit the first transaction.
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:48:37
No "Defense and security" comes from mining. Nodes provide greater privacy and verification. And both provide decentralization in two different dimensions. 
They estimate the number of nodes to be over 100,000, you are only counting the PUBLIC nodes that are currently accepting inbound connections, not ones behind a default home internet connection.
Not everyone needs to run a node, if the number dropped below 1000, then sure, feel free to run one for reasons above.

@_date: 2019-06-02 14:31:35


Not quite, A UTXO is the transaction output. The UTXO is created by referencing the transaction ID of the previous transaction, plus an index number to reference which output (because there could be multiple outputs for a transaction), the blockstream explorer shows this.
They are not "bound" to addresses but more of a reference to the past of where (which output) did the funds come from, and if it has not been spent, you can spend it, so:
UTXO = unspent transaction output = transaction ID + index output number (of a transaction that hasn't been spent)
[Blockchain.com/explorer]( does a bad job of visualizing this because it shows 'inputs' as 'addresses' and hence the confusion.
[Blockstream.info]( does a better job as it shows inputs as "transactionID:index" which is a better visualization of UTXOs but doesn't show you the address.
You can see my example of the same transaction in both explorers in my previous comment.
So both are correct,

@_date: 2019-06-02 12:52:59
Stop replying to everyone here telling them they are wrong, its just you. 
I'll give you an example, if you've ever looked inside a block, haven't you ever wondered why some transaction inputs reference the same address multiple times? 
[ 
That's because its not referencing the address itself, but more accurately the transaction IDs of where that transaction received funds in the past, even if its the same address receiving funds 5 times, all that adds extra space.
Blockstream explorer shows a better view of this by showing the inputs as transaction IDs (instead of addresses) so we can see the same example below:
[ 


No it is relevant, because you don't "receive coins" you just have access to spending coins from a previous transaction given to you that is left on the blockchain, which you then need to make a redemption, which you do by making another transaction to another person later in the future.

You're still missing the point, you can't send ANY amount of bitcoin basically for free. It needs to be under, say $500 or so, otherwise it could fail, or you pay a transaction fee (which isn't free) to do large transactions. So ANY amount for free, is a misleading statement, in the picture by OP.

You're not likely to have a channel open to the person you are paying, that's the point of lightning to route payments to anyone on the network.

* Green Wallet (now known as blockstream green)
* Ledger Live
* Samourai Wallet

* Mycelium
The first 2 have lightning network capabilities,   
Green Wallet can be used with a ledger hardware wallet and has Tor  
Ledger Live only works with a ledger nano X or S (hardware wallet) and supports multiple crypto-currencies   
Samourai has some built-in advanced features including Tor and can be used with a Trezor hardware wallet  
The last 2 are popular multiple crypto-currencies wallets
But DYOR and find the wallet best suited to your needs, as a minimal, always make sure you control the keys (seed phrase), and it at least has segwit support (if your bitcoin addresses start with a "1" its probably an out-of-date bitcoin wallet).

I learnt practically, by generating one, it's just a single address and private key, most wallets can sweep a private key if you scan them. The public qr code will allow you to send funds to it and verify the amount.

@_date: 2019-12-03 13:37:39
The reason why the supply is nearly impossible to change, because if a developer just increased the supply or reward rate in the source code, all the rest of the miners, node operators, exchanges, etc. would still be running the original code prior to the upgrade, and any miner that attempts to inflate bitcoins supply faster than this rate will have there blocks rejected by the rest of the network because of the original code. The only way is to have everyone agree (miners, nodes, exchanges etc.) and then for everyone to upgrade and enforce the new rules at a set date in the future. Of course not everyone will agree, the people who upgrade to the new rules could operate bitcoin with a new supply rate, but the original nodes will reject these newly mined blocks and bitcoins, and then mine a different block attached to the last block they think is valid, thus a hard fork is created.
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:24:37
Or a paper wallet with a qr code private key which can be sweeped by a wallet is better. That way once sweeped, only they have access to the funds. Whereas the 12 words means you share access to their funds and all future transactions that occur on the wallet, unless they are nifty enough to migrate to another wallet (not that you would do anything malicious, but there would be an element of trust involved).

If you lost all your crypto funds now, would you be sad for a few days or weeks? Then get a hardware wallet. 
If you wouldn't be too fazed by it, like change in your physical wallet, then you can just withdraw that amount to a mobile wallet.

You would want at least 300GB of disk space, the full (not pruned) blockchain is about 210-215GB currently, and grows a few megabytes every 10 minutes. For memory, 2GB is minimal, 4GB memory better.

So many people spend there money carelessly and get themselves into debt. Not because the average person even knows the difference between "inflationary vs deflationary currencies" but because of human nature's needs and wants, this will still happen in a deflationary currency.
Also if you want to know how practically a deflationary currency would feel like. Think of technology, i.e. your PC, laptop, phone, tablet, TV, etc. Your phone might be $500, in 2 years you'll still pay $500, but your phone will have twice as much memory, storage and CPU. That's deflationary.

A wallet is just software, since bitcoin is open source, anyone can download the original bitcoin software for free and use that as a wallet, which is called "bitcoin core", it downloads the full blockchain but isn't recommended for beginners if you don't know how to configure it.
Mobile wallets: blockstream green, coinomi, samourai wallet.
PC wallets: electrum, bitcoin core.
Each have there different advantages, i.e. coinomi allows you to store other cryptocurrencies not just bitcoin.
For storing large sums of money say $1000+, you'd pay for a hardware wallet: ledger, trezor, coldcard (since the important cryptographic keys are stored on the device and not your mobile or PC which would be subject to hacking/malware).
You also should never be paying for a wallet service, you should only pay a small fee on buying/selling bitcoin at an exchange, the exchange can also hold onto your bought bitcoin (like a web wallet) until you withdraw your bitcoin, so there is no reason to ever use a web wallet other than your exchange. Web wallets also don't give you the keys/seed phrase, so they hold onto your funds/bitcoin which you need to trust them, just like a bank, which bitcoin was initially trying to avoid.

You could buy $100 or more in bitcoin and send it to your own wallet and pay the $5 fee, then when spending it from your own wallet, you can set the fee yourself and only pay a few cents per transaction.

The lowest fee you can pay on bitcoin is 1sat/byte. But if a typical segwit transaction contains at least say 200 bytes, then you're still paying 200 satoshis... So in your example, 800sats = $800k, if the transaction is 400bytes, then half of it goes to fees, ($400k) at the lowest rate of 1sat/byte. Maybe hopefully by then we'll have another way of reduce fees on-chain?

That's wrong. All bitcoin (full) nodes validate all the transaction/contract data in the blockchain by executing everything, otherwise how would it validate/know the correct results?
The difference here, for example, you cannot code "loops" in your contracts, and many other things, so its not a "real" programming language i.e. not turing complete. So the only way to make a contract do a lot of computational work on the blockchain, is to have a very big contract, i.e. more code/data on the blockchain = more bytes = higher cost. 
Ethereum is turing complete, which is great for programmers, i.e. you can have loops, however this introduces a new problem, that a smart contract may be small in code, but could take minutes/hours to execute. Since its difficult (and even impossible) to tell how long a piece of turing complete code will take to run (minutes or hours), ethereum introduced a gas cost associated with all transactions, so when a contract executes, if it takes too long, and all the gas is consumed, it can just stop executing that code because you didn't pay enough gas.

Look at the purchasing power of the US dollar over the past 100 years.


Bitcoin has been working for over 10 years


Your phone still works when the power goes out, and so two people can still transact between each other without a 3rd party. You can then use solar power to recharge battery packs for your phone.
What will happen to your digital money you call mastercard, visa, bank transfers and paypal goes down because your 3rd party is unavailable? Also cash doesn't work online buddy but crypto does.

Sorry for your loss, an expensive lesson learnt.
- Never use paper wallets (there are many reasons why)
- Use reputable wallets for small amounts.
- Buy a hardware wallet from the manufacturer, it's a small cost $50-100, to secure larger amounts.

A phone that works without being connected to the power grid? Every phone does buddy because they have this little device inside called a battery! It allows the phone to work on average for ~24 hours before having to recharge it. 
Carry battery packs, portable power generators (diesel or solar powered). If you phone is say 3000mAh then carry a 20000mAh battery pack in your pocket and some in your bag and you can easily get a week's worth of power.
Have a small camping generator at home connected to a cheap solar panel to charge your generator or battery packs throughout the week.
If your low on power, switch off your phone, only use it for a few hours a day when making calls or transactions, how hard is that to understand???

That 2.15 is going towards taxes. Maybe you can sell your 4btc for $2M, but once you move that cash into an investment account, the IRS will want to know where it came from and tax it.

Its not gambling as much as buying gold or any commodity stock. Trading crypto over the short term compared to the long term is more of a gamble.
It's only "highly risky" if he is using his mortgage (or other loans) to buy bitcoin, since he'd risk getting liquidated. Since he's downsizing, he'll have extra cash savings in the bank, which if he uses for bitcoin, then that would be his spare money. He's just investing in a highly volatile market (without leverage) which is fine if hes comfortable with volatility and can afford to lose it if it goes to 0 (unlikely).

Technically both btc and bch implement the bitcoin protocol and they both have taken different directions since bitcoin first launched (segwit, lightning, big blocks). If you had original bitcoins a few years back, you would have equal amounts of btc and bch after the fork because they both stem from the genesis block satoshi created. This whole argument of btc vs bch has turned into this silly religious war where religions fork one another and claim to have the original meaning.

The title is misleading


Would you say that silk road and other terrorists have "hijacked" bitcoin blockchain, or are they merely using it because of it's open for anyone to use which is by design.
Something can't be "hijacked" if its by design, as bitcoin doesn't care if you're white, black or a druggy.
Also the common person is just going to read the article and think "bitcoin" or the "blockchain" has been hacked by malware by just reading the headlines or by not understanding the article.

Yeah, but since he also has the X, he can just use that, and keep his top 3-5 on the S. Of course all the crypto is stored in the seed regardless of how many apps you have. It was just an example to explain that.

If they nuke every country and every single person then we'd all be dead anyway, if you happened to survive on your own, you'd value food and ammo as your currency not a shiny rock called gold or bitcoin or cash.
But more likely if a few major countries got nuked, the rest of the world will still continue to operate. And I'd be a lot more comfortable carrying my phone like everyone else but with a global currency called bitcoins on it, rather than waddling around with gold and cash in my pockets while looking to get out of a war torn state/country.
Bitcoin is a global currency and doesn't care about nukes, your country's government issued money isn't going to be so valuable if your country is in a war torn state and getting hit by nukes.

The easiest way is "bitcoin core" is a full node + wallet software, so just using the software you are validating your own transactions.
If you want to use mobile, i.e. "blockstream green wallet" on Android/iOS can be configured to connect in SPV mode instead of blockstreams servers, then you can choose to connect to trusted SPV nodes only, i.e. your own.
You can also use Electrum on desktop/PC and have that connect to either "electrum personal server" or "electrs" since electrum requires an electrum server connected to a node.
Green wallet -&gt; bitcoin node (via SPV node)
Electrum wallet -&gt; bitcoin node (+ running electrs/EPS)
Both Green wallet/electrum can either take a 24 seed words, or use a hardware device for extra security, i.e. ledger nano S.

It's the perfect amount, 0.15 is your buffer or for immediate emergencies. 1 BTC you'll hold forever, never touch it until retirement when you're 60+, this will be extremely valuable when the day comes. Another 1 BTC for anything you want before retirement 30-60 years old (don't spend much in your 20s, just work and accumulate the 6.15 BTC). The 3 BTC left is for boats and hoes, strippers and coke.

no it would be very much worse. 0.00000001 btc is $0.0001 per 24h, which is only 1 cent every 100 days. I can almost guarantee you his electricity to power it is more than 1 cent per 100 days, probably around $0.10 - $1 per day if its a lower powered device on 24h or more.

True, and the blockchain was a few kilobytes at the time in 2009, still less than 1GB, 3 year later in early 2012.

Explanation is they are not an exchange, you are simply buying and selling your coins to coinbase. Just like how buying and selling prices are different on bitcoin ATMs, pawnshops etc. 
If you traded at an exchange, you would see the buy/sell order books in real time with trades being filled. Look at "coinbase pro" to see what I mean.

Your Ledger nano S can store as many cryptocurrenies (coins) as you want, you just need to uninstall one if you want to install another app as yes it only holds about 3-5 different apps at the same time. The Ledger will generate a seed phrase, you use that as the "backup" physically written down somewhere safe. You can always reset your ledger nano X or S as many times as you want as long as you have the backup/seed. Both ledgers can use the same seed at the same time, and will have access to the same funds, so it really doesn't matter which ledger you want to use.

Agreed, counter argument for XRPs large stake is that its in escrow and time-released, they sell those tokens to banks that want to adopt the technology for cheap (and sign contracts not to sell it on exchanges) and move leftovers back into the escrow, and they have a track record of doing this over many years. Nevertheless, I would never trust an entity to do this as power can corrupt and would rather a code based solution of releasing tokens like bitcoin, its slightly better than fiat, but lets just leave Liquid and XRP for the banks, exchanges and businesses that want that level of federation between themselves. Let build on LN instead :D
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:34:40
Liquid utilizes bitcoin by pegging to its price, not its security. You lock up bitcoin on-chain and that releases liquid tokens, but that liquid network only as a few centralized nodes that are publishing blocks out of thin air with no POW, reminds you of something else? Except there is hundreds of nodes in XRP, hence why ripple network is much more secure and decentralized then liquid. If liquid was adopted and had hundreds of nodes, then it would have the same level of centralization as XRP. 
I have no problem if you hate XRP and liquid, or you like both XRP and liquid. Its just that when someone bashes XRP and supports liquid it just doesn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:18:51
But you are simply not. You have "traded" your bitcoin for an alternate token on another separate blockchain which has no POW/POS and is controlled by a federation of a few nodes/exchanges. If they wanted to rollback, reverse, censor or double spend a transaction, it is very feasibly, even more than XRP. 
Like its super new, if you transferred your bitcoins to liquid, and the few actors running the liquid network decided to say "lets scrape this project" (not that it would happen) you wouldn't be able to get your coins out as you are required to go though a federation member.  
If you want to use liquid, or XRP, by all means go ahead, just don't say "you are holding bitcoin" or "its just as secure as bitcoin" which is a complete fallacy. I would recommend bitcoin for security, LN for micropayments, and Liquid/XRP for B2B, which are all vaild scenarios.

He is referring to brain wallets where one uses a password to generate a bitcoin wallet, which is highly not recommend, as humans naturally use low entropy passwords, and people will be running massive databases searching for such brain wallets.
Also you are wrong about cracking a bitcoin address. Encryption is always 10, 20, 50 years away until we can break it. Encryption hasn't stayed the same, its constantly evolving and we are always updating what encryption standard we use on the internet. 
Bitcoin cracking will be a form of mining for those who don't  upgrade there wallets in the years to come. i.e. going after lost coins. Andreas has said this a few times in his videos.

Because when you created the container or as soon as you decrypt and mount the container, you are left vulnerable with the private keys now exposed to any type of spyware or keyloggers. The safest option is using a hardware wallet so the keys never leave the device or touch the computer, even if you have hundreds of viruses on your computer.
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:30:01
Why would you need that much? You probably don't need that many. 
Even a few bitcoins (on testnet) is more than enough for millions of transactions!
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:47:41
I don't understand the point of liquid, only good thing is it is a "stablecoin" of bitcoin. You can already use other altcoins for cheaper transactions at the expense of some level of security/centralization. 
But liquid won't have anywhere near the same amount of security as bitcoin and some altcoins. Liquid is basically a bitcoin pegged-XRP like tech, so using XRPs tech with 6-7 years development would be a lot more secure then liquid and I don't even like XRP.
It's amazing how much XRP gets bashed here for being less secure yet we welcome liquid to solve our scaling problems which would have less security (or the same security as XRP if its adopted as much as XRP).
For now, I'll stick with bitcoin for security, and maybe in the future if we are all using cryptos, then LN or altcoins for faster/cheaper transactions. Liquid and XRP I see as a Business-to-business settlement layer between crypto exchanges or banks.

Hardware wallets protects you from spyware and other digital attacks, it keeps your private seed away from online computers, laptops, phones. Hardware failure is a different story, that's why you have offline backups, a password protected seed, on paper, laminated, engraved on steel etc, in more than one location combined with a hardware wallet.
Also an encrypted volume is not cold storage unless your are using an air-gapped computer. A hardware wallet is more cold, because it doesn't have a direct internet connection.
