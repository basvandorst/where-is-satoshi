Not really, all it's doing is taking BTC out of the hands of actual people and stock piling it on 3rd party sites who probably in return sell it back to us at a premium. WOW. 
This is the same as this analogy. You want a product that costs $10, you pay with 10  The  are converted to $10 and sent to company. Someone then decides they want 10  3rd party charges $13 for 10  
@_date: 2017-02-01 19:34:45
ahh, I found it. It was bitcoinity. Now trying to see if there's a site just like those but for the NYSE
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:39:18
I mean, it's not really "going BTC" they just convert through bitpay or whatever. I'd be excited as fuck if I was a 3rd party BTC &gt; Fiat converter. I'd be making a fuckton of profits.
This is good for bitcoin as an alternative way to spend money, but not good for bitcoin as a sole currency.
Idk to me it's not any different then saying walmart is now accepting paypal... cool
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:55:37
Well what other option is there? I don't have 10k for an avalon machine lol and ASIC miner blades are WAY WAY over priced... for $288, half the price i've spent on my 1GH/s cards, I can get 5GH/s down the road. Sure there's been crazy delays and everything. But I still think it's a great money maker. You can probably make more profit buying them and reselling on EBAY once you get it.

so put in an order for 100 BTC  and see what happens ;) haha
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:42:42
Thankfully the creator came up with an interesting design for bitcoin. Even if every bitcoin in the world was lost except for 1. There would STILL be enough currency to go around since you can split it into the millionths?.  Also the more bitcoins that are lost, the less supply = higher price per BTC.

@_date: 2013-06-16 23:43:15
its not about receiving BTC it's the ability to be able to spend them freely. Hoarding is great for now, but if there is no outlet to spend them. then they really have no value beyond wild speculation at this point.
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:34:04
If that happened that means the price would have dropped to like $1/BTC

They do have a little baby USB unit, They are selling it for $39 if you hold 5000 shares or more. the rest I think will be auctioned off. They only get 300Mh/s but if you can get a hold of 10 or more, they use very little power.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:25:09
Hit around 55 last night. I'd be okay at $60 since it always seems to jump back up to 90-100 the next night

whether you feel he is a dick or not, this is great publicity for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:42:57
I agree with you there but these are very tough times for small businesses... selling your inventory at full price cash or 90-95% in credit can be a big difference. My guess is it's a small coffee shop or something where the average transaction is only a few dollars. Credit cards take something like 10% fee on low transaction amounts under $10 let's say just for example. So excluding credit cards will gain them 5-8% if they have to turn away 1-2% of customers who don't have $5 on them you know?

you're not the only one. And I bet 90% of the people talking shit here never ordered anything from BFL. Yeah they were late in production, but pretty sure theres 50x as many BFL rigs out there then ANY other company (not counting the USB sticks that get the speed of a normal GPU)
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:34:52
Well instantly it goes up a bit, but the domino effect usually pushes the price up/down from that one big sale.
@_date: 2013-06-18 02:35:45
At the very least process through ebay so there's some sort of protection levels. Also i've seen GPU miners go on ebay for a pretty good premium, $1300 builds selling for $1800 or more. It's not perfect but paypal is insanely easy to move cash in/out of.. BTC, not so much
@_date: 2013-05-19 08:32:58
okay even if that was true. I would take hundreds of years no?
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:45:32
b/c people who ordered at first are butthurt even though they all got miners before anyone else. Idk why they are bad. They aren't any better then a video game dev that pushes back a release date a year...
Avalon has done WAY fucking worse, mining with rigs they were suppose to ship.
I ordered a 50gh/s from BFL on black friday and got it in my house exactly 7 days later...
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:46:51
It's been called selective scamming. Steal from only 5% of the users and 95% of the customers will stand up for you
@_date: 2013-07-30 07:54:52
How do you figure? BFL has been very transparent about their products and you can even see daily shipping updates. Sure it took a LOTTT longer for development then anyone would have liked. But it's better IMO then giving payment to a company that has seemed to completely disappear the past 3-4 months.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:03:51
Exciting, Also shocked at the size of the prize for one match. This is about the same amount of money a winner of a small professional tournament could expect. Not as much as global championships but a great chunk of change for one series..
Also. Scarlett is gonna wreck naniwa. go ZERG
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:27:46
I was thinking about this myself. The problem is whenever you DO get the 5Gh/s rig, there will also be about 8000Gh/s in other rigs going out as well. So the difficulty will go up a crapton making your GPUs perfectly useless. I'd venture to say that a 5Gh/s rig will be about as profitable as 2 GPU's are right now. I'd definitely not put any more money into GPUs since you can get a 5Gh/s unit for the same price anyways.
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:02:41
you know if you don't want it, you can just sell your pre-order to me.

So then if he goes through the proper channels of paypal then he should be able to get his money. I'm just saying with ebay it's more clear cut on what you sold, the price, the shipping is confirmed so there would be no contest that he should have the money.

I thought about this. if someone had let's say 5k bitcoins, they could theoretically just sell them all off at the high price, which would push the price down a bit and maybe a little more from others selling. Then just buy them all back in a lump sum when it's at the lowest - Profit. Right?

Just going to throw this out there. I don't have time to memorize 8 different random words, i'll forget that shit in a heartbeat.. Whole words, are incredibly easy to crack, so instead you make a lot of whole words? It makes MUCHHHHHHHHHHHH more sense to just lengthen your current password.
Example. Your current password for most sites happens to be "DTaylor85". Easy to remember right? well this would be semi easy to crack with brute force. So lets add something to it
Your password went from being cracked in a year to cracked in about 437 BILLION years. or basically never. Just by adding easy to remember characters

@_date: 2013-12-19 05:24:51
That's the dumbest thing i've ever heard... i'm pretty sure we are all here to make money. short term, long term whatever. We want financially to be more ahead then we were at the start right? so I don't understand what you mean... are people being forced at gunpoint to have bitcoins against their will?? We all obviously accept the risk and know that the market can swing in an instant. That's the fun part of the whole thing. 1 BTC isn't really "worth" anything. Its value depends on people to assign it value by buying it and selling it to each other.

Same here brother... Didn't have the funds when the price crashed from 200 down to 50/60ish. Would have bought in then... Couldn't afford it. kind of ironic now b/c for $600 i'd be sitting on $9500 in 6 months.

I don't see how bitcoin is the answer to Paypal. I would never EVER EVER EVER send BTC to a random person in exchange for their item on Ebay. What's to stop them from saying, they never paid, and steal my BTC? What would be better is if Paypal adds bitcoin, not to fund your account but to hold with them and spend as you see fit. 
Then Ebay sellers could select an option on their items if they would also accept bitcoin as payment through Paypal.
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:38:04

@_date: 2013-04-19 03:38:25
does it? you must have NVidia. with the rising difficulty I'd love to have at least 2Gh/s and it's great ASICs use about 1/10th the power of a GPU so even matching your speed now is a huge profit increase % wise
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:39:01

BFL announced the design for the minirigs needed to be reworked. they are SO FAR off from having a working minirig it's not even funny. It's just someone who would rather sell his pre-order and make a small profit rather then get a refund or wait months and months for a working design.
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:41:00
It's more accurate if you look at a 2 week timespan. Let me ask you, does it take 2 weeks to pull off a 51% attack? how long would it take? 2 hours?
@_date: 2013-04-21 06:54:40
difficulty changes about every 2 weeks right now? and much much faster once more ASICs come online. 
Not totally useless but it would literally take a very long time to make back 75 BTC. It's their money if they want to spend so much on wild speculations then that's up to them. But it just doesn't make any sense mathematically to me.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:40:04
using the profit calculator  entering the expected global hash rate, then adjusting difficulty until time to complete one block solo = 10 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:47:29
I know that, but I keep thinking about when it was $60/BTC so it's hard to justify spending $60 on .05 BTC lmao
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:53:21
possibly, then the winner can just claim they were misled and get a prompt refund. The thing that scares me is all these people accepting bitcoins for payment on Ebay. Isn't bitcoin basically anonymous? Meaning there would be no way to prove that payment was actually sent correct?
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:22:12
lol that's cool but there was also a pretty big wall up at $70 IIRC
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:35:21
Yeah I don't see how it's a companies fault that you chose them over straight investing in BTC. They had really good marketing and made people believe them. Product took much longer than expected and no guarantee was ever given. Just do more research before dropping 4k on something that is still in development.
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:10:07
and where do you think all the ASIC chips are coming from? hahaha
@_date: 2013-08-04 05:51:47
I think what he was referring to in a way was the fact that if the difficulty is rapidly increasing, it's because (in part) they have been shipping units (slowly but surely) for the better part of the past 2 months. 
More units = higher hashrate = higher difficulty.
Now of course they aren't the only company making ASIC units but they are a contributing factor nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:27:09
yeah, pretty much. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:22:40
They are currently auctioning 10 blades of 10Gh/s power.   
The lowest bid so far is something like 62 BTC. Most likely people who bought bitcoins longggg before it was over $50. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:24:28
lol that's if you have 220, most regular outlets here in US are 110. Also, it's not a toaster or heating device. Those heating coils drain a crapton of electricity so can't really compare the two
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:26:43
Well that's the price Avalon had put on the batch  units. at the last difficulty it was 75 BTC. or at todays price, $9000. it's true other people calculate differently but at the price of BTC right now it's really not worth spending over $25-30k on it.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:54:01
Well in one year from today. the difficulty will be so high, their 10gh/s will be pretty much useless. 
If they knew exactly how much their coins were worth. Why did they decide to spend $9000 on a rig that would take them 152 days at todays low difficulty to make back? Once the difficulty increases in about 2 months, it will take them 2 years to make it back. and once we get to fall. holy shit. going to take the same machine &gt; 10000 days to mine the 75 bitcoin of original investment. (estimated)

Sell the one you have on Ebay, you can get $350-400 no problem for that one...
The other one, go on the BFL forums. Find BFL_Emily and send her a PM, she does the CSR stuff. I sent an email about an issue I had and never got it answered. 
Hope this helps!
I agree they aren't the most responsive company but given the amount of orders they had they've done their best and IMO are better then Avalon. Could be better but just happy there is something USA based that we can buy from you know?
well best of luck to you
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:14:55
ok ok, I feel the minirig was a theoretical design. 1W/GH? I don't think that's possible. Either the chip company misled them or they severely misjudged total power consumption. Even with the new boards they are getting in, a 5Gh/s will definitely pull 10w AT LEAST. I wouldn't be surprised if they scratch the minirig all together.
Even at 1500w. Where the hell would you plug that in? you'd need a dedicated 20amp circuit breaker. over 1500? now you need a 30-40amp breaker. GL with that
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:46:18
300 million would be some ridiculous mining power to reach that. if 200,000 asic chips were all mining at the same time then that would be a global hash power of about 950Th/s. This would increase the difficulty to roughly 135 milion. give or take. 300M is a good over estimate though esp. if you are considering dropping 30-40k on a single rig
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:23:53
agreed. anyone who puts more then that into a virtual speculative currency is quite foolish
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:16:58
I see. Yes I think we definitely need a trusted bitcoin escrow site. With the posts about all these exchanges and how shady most of them seem, I still think it'll be a while before I trust sending bitcoin for purchases unless they are from actual online merchants
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:11:59
this seems like the legit reason. But if they did do it a long time ago, and something messed up again and it got pushed back again... they would have to do it all over again lol
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:11:20
I tend to agree, as shady as they seem, it's been pointed out that they've delivered in the past on FPGA models. Maybe they are just having some fun collecting BTC with their friends before the market becomes flooded and the difficulty rises like hell
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:24:45

@_date: 2013-04-23 20:55:56
well he's pretty old fashion in that sense. Bitcoins rely on the fact that you need the internet to use them right? So if the internet suddenly is turned off for extended period of time. What good would your Bitcoins be? That's his point I believe.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:56:51
I see your point.. so is there (or there should be) a website that calculates a pools hashrate versus number of solved blocks. This way you know for sure that your shares are getting the best return from the pool.
But as others have said, BTCguild has a great website, easy to use, reliable, trustworthy.

@_date: 2013-12-09 00:32:32
not sure why downvoted... if you run mining on pools that get 1 block out of 20... then 19 blocks you are doing work for nothing
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:49:53
those same analysts I'm sure are holding thousands of BTC lmao. But in all honesty, if Bitcoin continues on the road it's on, the rising difficulty along with the next cut in block reward could easily reach $10k in the next few years.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:11:36
i'm gonna test your theory tomorrow. Currently making about 0.031 BTC for 24 hours on BTCguild... gonna switch back to slush's for tomorrow and see what the 24 hour income is... if it's .03 or more then theory proved. But if it's less then it doesn't seem worth it. I know it's about variance etc. but I'd prefer a steady income rather then one that can vary wildly wouldn't you?

@_date: 2013-04-19 20:28:44
Right, you don't need to be over 50% for 2016 blocks, you only need to be over 50% for a short amount of time. so it's better to look it at in shorter time frames.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:49:11
Exactly. In fact I believe Satoshi himself explained this in the bitcoin paper. How there would always be incentive to mine. 
The general consensus is that BTC price will one day (who knows when) in the future will reach $1,000. Why else would it be able to split up into millionths (and even more) of 1 coin? It was said even if every coin in the world was lost except for 1. there would be enough to split that coin up to how many ever people wished to use it.
As far as difficulty goes. This seems like a huge money pit. Yes if you can amass the most Hashing power then it will always be very profitable. But just starting out it's very difficult. The only incentive to GPU mine right now is the high price of coins. I had actually stopped when it crashed down to $50 because it was no longer profitable to mine 8 hours on my 1 little GPU to make $.50. Then it showed signs again of increase and I decided to drop $400 on a really powerful GPU that if I get tired of it in a few months, can still sell back to gamers and get 90-100% of the value back.
I had thought about preordering the BFL $2500 machine, but later decided that was too risky of an investment and just opted for the 5Gh/s $280 one. It's not going to be much when I finally get it. but it'll be a starting point. and by then, more machines will be in the hands of people who maybe decide they want to sell their extra units. It will be MUCH easier to calculate profitability when the ASICs are actually in hand ready to be sold.

Thank you for this link. but from what i've heard, Bitpay and Coinbase there are some reports of fraud or theft. I will have to research them further.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:27:03
Long term of course is a great idea, the entire theory is that it will grow and a bitcoin will be worth about $1000 (some years from now) that's why you can fraction a bitcoin into such tiny pieces. Also I feel more profit can be made in the short term playing this thing like a day trader lol
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:03:00
The value is determined by how many bitcoins it can mine in 30 days a Difficulty x2.  At current difficulty and value it would be worth $6189
@_date: 2013-07-29 07:45:49
Yeah.. look at the charts 6k bought and an hour later 6k sold as well lol
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:53:16
True, for all we know it could be the other competing Bitcoin exchanges that are doing it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:57:07
sure, If I ordered day 1 and the date got pushed back 6 months to a year i'd be upset as well. but the gear was still profitable when they started shipping in september-ish? but I think they get more hate then they deserve while other companies are straight stealing from people but there's not many posts about that.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:08:52
A Jalapeno by the time you get it would take at least 3 months to earn back (at current price, which could be higher or lower when you get it) They said new orders would be AT LEAST July. Meaning July, August, Septemeber etc.

Great idea. -_- let's turn BTC into wall street... Ask anyone with knowledge of trading, derivatives are the worst thing to ever happen to the stock market.
and you want to apply the mass controlled/manipulated wall street format to our beloved Bitcoins??? why???????
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:59:51
I see. so you really only need to maintain over 50% for let's say 3 blocks in a row giving you thirty minutes. Then again. the more blocks in a row, the lower the probability to pull off an attack. So why is everyone so scared of 51% the odds of hitting 2 blocks in a row would be 25.5% right?
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:25:11

Leave it to the govt media to try to link bitcoins with guns (the govts mortal enemy)
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:20:48
Considering that most of those people aquired their BTC either from mining very early on or purchased when they were much MUCH lower in price. I'm sure they've done the math. I'd also like to note that the blades are in hand and shipped immediately. Thus giving you a huge advantage over everyone else. Then again. could just sell the bitcoins for cash and profit just as much I think.

I think these sold for 75 BTC so that would be about $8k at least.
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:54:47
Yeah and this thread if they had NOT mined on a live network would say...
BFL MAKES UP HASHING SPEED. NOT CONNECTED TO NETWORK!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:07:22
True, it would take a year at least, probably longer. I don't think the bidders considered this, they just figured they have 75 Bitcoins they paid $6 each or less. So it's a smart investment. I don't know. When i saw the bidding go over 50, I was pretty shocked.

Yes I understand how receiving a payment works, but what's stopping the seller from claiming the funds were never sent? How can the buyer prove to ebay that the payment was indeed sent?

According to the graph on that post, they seem to have made a link to big transactions followed by a dive in the market a short time after.
(This is purely speculation but here's my theory)
Let's say I had, oh idk 400,000 bitcoins. How could I sell those in a way that wouldn't completely wipe out the entire currency itself?
Selling them in large chunks with time in between to let the market correct itself would net me the largest financial gain possible. I will explain.
Last year, bitcoins worth over $200. Sell 100k bitcoins, sweet! Price drops to $60 then eventually takes off again to $130 then later skyrocketing to astronomical prices, sell off another 100k coins, price drops 60-70% down to 400-ish. Later returns to our current level of 650-700 range.
Now the way I see it, my last sell off didn't drop the value below my first sell off, so selling another 100k at 700 is a VERY good deal. Prices would fall down close to the 100-200 range. Then allow it to bounce back up while I wait for that to happen before I sell the rest of my stash.
Does that make sense to anyone else?
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:39:30
if it's hourly I am CERTAIN you will find they have crossed the 50% mark before. If you find such a site, check the hours from 4-17 when slush pool was DDoS'd
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:16:41
thank you for correcting me, the price fluctuates wildly, thus proving my point further, 15k sold in one transaction, quite a hit on the young market
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:21:46
I think it's wayyy too late now. a share is something like 1 BTC at least. check here. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:37:17
And his evaluation has NOTHING to do with the fact they own millions if not billions in bitcoins? lmao ofc they want to hype up the value as much as possible.

I could see Randy going bitcoin crazy with a HUGE mining operation in the basement lmao
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:49:24
The thing right now is since the currency is relatively young, it's possible for some people to acquire mass amounts of it, thus one giant sell option scares everyone into thinking the market is crashing when in reality it was just some people cashing in for a profit.  Think of it as if you had a million dollars, and bought every BTC that you can afford when it was 60-80 last night, now today when it hit 115 and you sell off your 2k BTC for profit, it would cause a slight drop in price, thus setting off a chain of selling from fear.
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:08:20
What happens when you sell $100 of supply for 1 BTC and the next day the value crashes to $45? Or do you instantly transfer BTC &gt; $USD and if so, what's the point of accepting BTC in the first place?

3 feedback?? seems totally legit Trollface.jpg
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:00:46
yes it's a given that ASICs will end GPU mining for good. it will just take about a year or two in total. Best bet is to get your hands on an Avalon unit ASAP before the difficulty goes up exponentially. Even at 70,000,000 difficulty, the first batch Avalon units would still pay for itself in about a month. Even the  batch (75 BTC) would pay for itself in about 6 months. Given the difficulty will likely not be close to 70 million this same time next year. But who knows.

Same problem here when I OC my cards too high they will throttle the clock in half to save heat. Even though they are barely hitting 75C. I think with the warmer weather coming around, you might need to get more fans on the units or clock down slightly (5%) and see if that helps at all.

Yes but for those who have "earned" BTC - and there are approx 11.2 MILLION of them in circulation... There has to be more outlets to spend them. Rather then simply converting them into Fiat to buy Ferrari's and the like. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:36:45
I think it would be a great starting point if you are interested in getting into mining. I feel that once more ASICs are shipped, there WILL be those that have ordered numberous units with the sole purpose to sell some extra one for profit. It will be MUCH easier to calculate profitability when these people actually get the units in hand to resell to people like us!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:48:12
He's not really risking anything.. if you win, you have a fuckton of money. if he wins, you are probably out a fuckton of money AND have to buy someone gold.
