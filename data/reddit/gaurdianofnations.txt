I nearly sold 5 of my 10 near the peak because I could have gotten my money back and still had 5 bitcoins.  But, alas, I held.  Now I'm just happy to be riding along.  We'll see how this thing goes, but I don't plan on selling.  Hopefully I get to use them to buy something someday?!

ya i thot about this and it makes a lot of sense to me.  its like the other side of mining lol.  hopefully the holes continue to get exposed and everything gets cleared up so that finally we (the masses) can achieve world domination.

something huh?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:55:05
doubling ur value in a couple weeks still is...

I don't think bitcoin's due for a correction any time soon. Bitcoin IS THE CORRECTION in our hyperinflated and mismanaged fiat currencies.  Up, up, we go.

ya sorry i didnt mean we'd be able to stop the attacks, but to defend against them...
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:32:43
I;ve seen this kind of thing too, but it seems to get it when you submit order

govts prob wont let it happen.  eventually.  but in the end decentralization, self-organization, and the power of creative individuals will usurp the govt.  i have faith in that.  so i have faith in bitcoin, and its successors.  we will likely never see 1BTC=50,000USD, but theoretically it is interesting to consider.  more likely that 50,000 will be distributed across the various virtual currencies as they pop up.
Many thanks, dear Satoshi.

i don't think they're handling real money yet.  and this sounds like a wonderful way to grow the infrastructure of the bitcoin community.  wish i knew a thing or two about hacking....
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:17:48
of course I believe heavily in the philosophy of decentralization and self-organization.  this is the future people , and its beautiful!

Alright reddit I'm going to get hated on for this but suppose I wanted to skill-up so I could competently contribute to this cause - where to start?  I know python :)

Taxes are an offspring of centralization.  Bitcoin is inherently decentralized.  So is nature, the only truly functional complex system of interacting agents on the planet.  So too will we be when we get our shit together and become responsible enough for ourselves and those around us that we don't have to rely on incompetent governments.

lol are you kidding me I haven't sold a thing.  I'm in it for the long haul.  I was looking at canadianbitcoins.  makes sense now.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:03:29
What's the sum total of world legitimate (whatever that means) currency?  Few dozen trillion?  If this is the future, a lot of that moves to bitcoin.  So if a trillion of that moves into the bitcoin medium, and total production is fixed at 21 million by 2140, we're talking 1BTC = 50,000USD...
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:22:47
so you want someone to steal your bitcoins?

Isn't realistically functional socialism libertarianism?  "We're all in this together..."
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:40:06
meanwhile, the USD, yen, pound, and Euro themselves are still not fine
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:18:56
sounds awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:42:32
i dont know nearly enough about internet security.  but what will it take to put a stop to this?  are more secure wallets and exchanges in reach?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:38:20
but ya im still seeing 219 on btc i dont get it.  do i need to be logged in? whats the deall....
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:35:41
oh shit.  looks like i better learn how to mount DDoS attacks.  Can we collab here and short the BTC?!  I'm still trying to download the block chain, so I mean, I can only gain...
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:34:29
great! 55 is a few dozen.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:14:55
hey this is awesome Im in Guelph (family in Toronto) and really been needing a local exchange, so thank you!
I'm trying to play with the $100 but its not letting me place orders... "could not complete order at this time" .  whats goin on?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:57:04
i think they will.  we need this kind of shit.  decentralized technology can only work if there are intense selection pressures - hackers bring on the selection pressures - the weak loose out, the strong survive, and the innovative propel us into the future.  Darwin, man.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:53:06
ya im not sure about this.  come let us know how u feel when japan or italy or spain or portugal or ireland or the uk or the states tank the fuck out and everybody floods bitcoin.  i hope uve saved a coin or two

no trades for less than a bitcoin?  trying to buy/sell 0.1 or 0.2 or 0.5 but no go.  1.2 worked tho...
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:46:36
does anyone even have a BFL ASIC yet?  Or are there only the Avalon's for 70BTC ?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:25:02
