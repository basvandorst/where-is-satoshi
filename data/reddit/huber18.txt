I though bitcoin couldn’t be hacked? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:10
It’s all speculative and cost this much because people are trying to get a quick buck. Most people don’t even know the actually reason bitcoin was made. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:26
He’s a sellout. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:04
Aren’t we all tryna pump tho ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:00
All exchanges are pretty much down

Mine took over 12 hours. Just got to wait it out bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:02
Blockchain never went over 15.5k. It’s odd. Never seen things work like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:25
You technically didn’t lose anything until you sell 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:44
I didn’t even realize ����

Bad business move. Bitcoin is not stable and can crash any day. Don’t do it and don’t risk it. Invest your own personal money if you want, but don’t put your business on the line. Bitcoin moves 20% some days. Not worth that risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:49:26
You expect 2 guest, you get 4k. How do you feel? Prepared? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:49:03
 Well it grew over 1900% in a year. What do you expect. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:45:27
Simply put, Hodl

Where can I find this chart?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:43:21
When I did stocks, it cost 7$ to buy then 7$ to sell. These 2$ fee’s are low in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:00
Bruh, she wound up losing 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:05:19
Already want 9000!? LOL
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:07:34
Mostly because I have no idea what I’m doing and going off of YouTube videos. What is the usual procedure? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:40:17
It’s more symbolic is what you mean.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:26
What do you mean by bots
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:43:53
Thank you, I will do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:32:42
But for the most part, it is stable and the  currency with a huge government to fall back on. 
Bitcoin essentially doesn’t have any of that. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:52:51
Way too early I. To be thinking about quitting your job. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:51:42
At 8k$ / bitcoin a 70% increase would be 13.6k / bitcoin. I can see it happening by end of February! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:26:40
Some weeks it will be positive, some weeks it will be Negative, and some weeks it will remain stagnant. Don’t question just Hodl
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:11:51
Why don’t you buy half a coin? Or a quarter of a coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:10:27
Thank you very much for the response, i have 2k$ im willing to dump once it dips. I’m simply testing right now so I don’t get hit with any surprises down the road. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:29:27
Wow there is one 15 minutes away from me. That’s crazy. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:27:28
Guys pay your taxes and don’t mess around with the IRS. They will come down hard on you 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:21:47
Yes, and this is my first week with bitcoin ( I bought at 7200$) it’s a little scary! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:52:11
But the dollar is backed by a military and government. Bitcoin is backed by essentially nothing and it’s very possible it can become worthless if enough people lose interest in it. 
Where as the dollar is the standard now and most likely for many many more years. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:41:23
But stocks will eventually always come back ( as seen time and time again) because of regulations and government banking. 
The professor is simply stating that bitcoin isn’t backed by anything. So when it drops, there’s no knowing if it will ever go back up. Creating fear and panic at every corner. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:49:30
Same with any investment. Fear that it won’t climb back up. Bitcoin isn’t as stable as many would say. This bad boy could crash any day now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:23:12
Agreed, no need to wait for dip, just ride the sucker out 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:12:11
One badass pie! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:13:34
When will we max out? Is it realistic to say it can pass Apple at 800billion but be stable? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:13:40
But I’m guessing it doesn’t mean anything unless people are paying in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:59:05
Boiled is best 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:23
Bad advice and unrealistic. He should take most out of you’re uncomfortable and leave what he’s comfortable losing ( not that it will lose). If this was an investment, get out when you’re good. And leave some just Incase. 
You did your thing, enjoy yourself now. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:34
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:03:01
That’s a bigger leap than Michael Jordan on the 3 point line 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:46:09
Most of it is definitely speculations. Most bitcoin investors are just that, investors. Here for a quick buck and do not even know or understand the ideology behind bitcoin. 
As soon as it does one more big drop, I dont it will rebound as fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:50:07
He’ll wake up at 3am with lots of pissed texts 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:46:30
I’m not any help at all, but this has been my concern with bitcoin. I just started investing but am reluctant as to how withdrawing works. 
So thank you for the thread. I hope to see some responses soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:44:08
This is very true! But we have to hodl -.- 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:17
Yes, exactly. Glad to see someone isn’t blinded by the truth of bitcoin. You can believe in bitcoin, but there is also some truth that nothing is stopping it from becoming worthless. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:56:43
Getting really tiring seeing this post every time coinbase lags. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:50:07
If Christmas comes and people exchange bitcoin to fiat to buy gifts, wouldn’t that lower Bitcoin price down? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:29:05
So the answer is yes? We are gambling big on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:37:01
I chose it because everyone else did 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:28:40
Seems you got hit with 3% charge. That seems to be about the normal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:59:57
Not sure if that’s what the chart says, but from common knowledge and interaction with the bitcoin community, that statement seems true to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:07:40
It works instantly at times and at times it lags. My first time sending coinbase to my wallet it took 5 hours. The other 2 times, it was practically instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:44:50
I like that way of thinking! :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:31:05
You didn’t lose shit because you haven’t sold yet. When it spikes to 15k. You’ll be dancing again. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:30:25
No idea what that term means. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:53:55
What newbies need to understand is you don’t need to buy a full coin. This is what stopped me from buying when it was at 4k. 
I did not know there were fractions to the coin, I simply thought it worked like stocks ( I’ve had several thousands in stocks before). 
My friend recently sent me .02 of a coin to get started and explained it to me, now I’m buying more and more daily. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:33:19
Thanks for the website :) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:27:57
That depends on what you want to risk. What if you sell and it never dips but runs up to another 15% in a week and hits 15k? Now to buy back in, it’s more expensive ( with fee’s on selling and buying). 
It can be tricky to say trade with bitcoin. That’s why most people just advise you to Hold. 
I’d only recommend selling once you want completely out, or u can take the risk and sell hoping for a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:41:01
Is this true or just a troll comment? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:30:33
As far as I know, the smaller the transaction the bigger the fee, percentage wise 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:47:23
You should explain, when he went into detail. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:50:58
Well, bitcoin will overtake naturally.
