Fuckin lol. Nuclear fission was postulated as a possible energy source during Einstein's lifetime (which by the way ended a full decade after Trinity). In fact, Einstein and the main developer and supporter of the very idea, Leo Szilard (who helped construct the first nuclear reactor just a few years later), wrote a letter together to President Roosevelt, warning him of the possibility of the Nazis using such an energy source as a weapon. This directly lead to the Manhattan project.
Einstein was literally one of the most significant instigators of the Manhattan project. ~~It's comical just how wrong you are.~~

There's actually a very [sensible article]( on the ABC explaining Bitcoin. Of course, it uses the Bitcoin-millionaires as a draw, but after that it's a great summation. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:05:48
And the response article completely acknowledges this, but notes that its volatility is mainly due to it still being a very small currency, and thus highly susceptible to "small" shifts. Bitcoin has only really started receiving significant mainstream media attention over the past year, and as more people adopt Bitcoin, it can be fully expected to become more liquid.

I am genuinely waiting for the inevitable crash though, to buy up more. There is obviously a sizeable portion at the moment that are just looking to make a quick buck, so it will be a bumpy ride when the nervous ones all buy out.

I read another comment that when it gets to the point where there are thousands of transactions per second, each day's blocks will be hundreds of gigabytes, and the entire blockchain will simply be prohibitively large to sync with. Surely this is a serious issue? It may happen sooner than storage and internet speeds have time to catch up.


Couldn't you basically print an IOU? Kind of like a cheque, just a one-use transfer from the account. Then you could have a physical wallet of fives, tens or whatever to hand out. Obviously it's not as secure as real cash, but at least they could only be used once, how confirmations already work to prevent double spending.

So much shit-posting lately.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:32:45
I'm thinking something more where the user prints their own to give out.  Say they use a program to generate a "ready" transaction of a set amount, it generates a note with a QR code to print out. Then you give it to someone like normal cash, but they just scan it later to complete the transaction by providing a deposit address. You couldn't double spend because each note is a unique transaction that has been prepared, and it will simply transfer the money from the issuer's wallet, kind of like a cheque. EDIT: I just realised how the issuer could double spend, because the receiver must trust that is not just a copy of a note that has already been used. I was focused on the receiver double spending. 
I don't know much about the technical workings of how this could be achieved though.

Actually, just trading Bitcoin for an altcoin would trigger a taxation event, based on the profit you made between buying the bitcoin and exchanging for the altcoin.

Except most of those principles could be applied to the drug trade as well (flat-out prohibition drives it underground and even further from your control), and yet look at the US government's response to drugs.

The idea is to generate a wallet on a fresh machine that has never been connected to the internet (alternatively a live USB boot of linux, though arguably slightly less secure) and then deposit funds into it using the public address it gives you. [Here's a good start](

@_date: 2013-11-16 12:54:54
It doesn't defeat the point, because the point is to convey how stupidly small these numbers are in comparison. It's impossible to properly appreciate numbers that are over a dozen order of magnitudes different, so relating to something that people *already* appreciate, like the smallest useful measurement in day-to-day life is somewhat helpful. Yes he could have expressed it in terms of metres but it's literally just three more zeros. The lay person appreciates the difference between a metre and a millimetre more than three zeroes out of like fifteen.
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:55:11
But if he bought straight coins when they were a dollar each he would have 2500 coins, not 250.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:08:08
The main argument I can think of that this is not the case is this: 
If Bitcoin is indeed the digital currency that ends up succeeding, adoption will be vastly greater than today. Millions, or maybe even billions of people will own Bitcoins, and since it is scarce (by design) the price has to increase. The main distinction between Bitcoin and the Dot-com bubble is that Bitcoin is a single (though decentralised) entity, while the dot-coms were a vast number of companies of varying possible value (in many cases none).

Can someone explain this to me: How could it even be profitable for a mining centre to rent hashes out to customers? You pay them, then they mine for you and presumably take a fee out to cover costs plus a little profit, but (ideally) still giving you enough to make it worth your while.

@_date: 2013-11-17 19:24:55

Of course the onus is on the citizen to report income no matter what currency it was earned in, and fundamentally BTC doesn't change that. But it must be admitted that if you were subject to an investigation, it would be much harder to follow the BTC trail than fiat trail. You can't deny that bitcoin, kind of by default, makes it easier to launder money.
And I'm not saying this is an indictment on bitcoin. You could similarly argue that mobile phones facilitate drug dealing. The important part is that we need to emphasise why the positive potentials far outweigh the negatives.

I don't think you understand the concept of day trading, which is specifically *short term*. Under the proper definition you aim to have no holdings at the end of the day. So you buy and sell on the little dips and peaks throughout the day, often within minutes of each other.

Like the other guy said, Gold has *some* intrinsic value, because it is used in transistors and other electronic/scientific applications. For those uses, gold is often the best material, and so it has physical value to those industries. Though there is much more "speculative" value added on top of that to bring it to its current price.
In the end there's not really such a thing as "true" intrinsic value, because ultimately someone is still deciding that it's valuable to them, for any number of reasons.

Do you actually think people believe banks just take your money, put it in a safe and protect it for you for free? The entire point of banks is that they get to invest and use your money while it's "in" the account. 
The ability to use your money is what you're selling them.
Edit: believe it or not, banks used to not charge fees for most accounts (at least here in Australia). They paid *you* in the form of interest for the privilege to use your money.
