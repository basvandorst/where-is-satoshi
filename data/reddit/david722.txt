They wrote a show for entertainment value, not education.  I'm merely happy the whole episode focused on how valuable Bitcoins are, especially in the eyes of the "smart guys".   Excellent PR in my book.

That’s called Gresham’s Law:

Thanks for the reply.   So is an fbar filing required for crypto holdings over 10K?

Phenomenally well written article.   I appreciate how you didn’t attempt to come up with some wild speculative number for future prices, but instead focused on the rational of value.

This sub has been chanting hodl for years now, during the ups and downs.   Though spreading a culture of hodling does benefit all, it's always made me skeptical of this sub and it's content.

Good video, just two points to critique:
1) The community prefers "Digital" currency over "Virtual".
2) You went into a lot of depth showing the inner workings, which is confusing to newbies.  I suggest a section showing the ease of use for the average user who doesn't need to know about public/private keys and how they work.  I.e., one doesn't need to be a cryptographer to use it.  Scan, enter BTC/$ amount and click send.

Another question, might not be CoinPocket specific.  I tested the app by moving $20 worth from coinbase to the CoinPocket.  The app shows a 0.0002 miner fee, $0.11 cents.  Does that seem too high or is it typical?

I only used CAPS with a place for bitcoin enthusiasts, never with my landscaper.   I don't think I was over zealous or preachy to my landscaper, read my first sentence "I'll mail a check today."

The difference is most merchants don't take credit cards for purchases under $10.

I was thinking that too.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:08:31

I think the ATM industry needs to stop displaying the current price for 1 BTC.   Would be much better to display something like "$20 = 0.05 BTC

175000 x 174999 x 174998 x 174997 174996 x 174995 x 174994 x 174993 x 174992 x 174991 x174990 x 174989 = 2.52^73

I was consistently impressed how well these "old white men" seemed to really comprehend Bitcoin.  At the point where one was saying, "How can I be expected to understand/use this?"  Andreas could have said "Do you understand HTTP or SMTP protocols?  No?  Well, have you ever used the internet or sent an email?"

This one is even better, the parallels to Bitcoin are uncanny!
"The biggest obstacle, in my view, is lack of user-friendliness," Yesawich says. "People will just not have the patience and take the time: busy signals and so forth. It's easier to pick up the phone and call your travel agency. Right now the Internet takes a lot of energy. A fascinating thing for people to dabble with; but I don't think it will fundamentally alter the landscape — certainly in terms of how travel is transacted — until we have touch screens, simple procedures, and more discipline in cyberspace. Forty percent of people who bought a PC last year tell us they spend more time trying to figure out how to use it than using it. That's my point."

I'll leave the same comment I leave whenever I see an ATM posted in this subreddit:  Don't just show the current price of 1 BTC, newcomers don't understand they can be divided.  You need to also show the current price for $5, $10 and $25 worth of BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:17:02
I'll tell you the same thing I tell all new ATM installers, because all seem to make the same mistake.  The vast majority of people visiting this ATM will be newbies who have never owned BTC before.  Don't scare them away showing the current price of 1 BTC, this assumes people know it's divisible.  Rather, below that price ALSO show **$25 = 0.02 BTC**

Just ranting about something that's been bugging me for years.  Why don't these payment processors publish a list of merchants that accept bitcoin as payment.  It's beneficial for the payment processor, the merchant, customers looking to spend their bitcoin and the bitcoin community at large.  Their website mentions 45,000 merchants, yet I don't know who they are so I can't shop!  Paging @_date: 2016-12-26 04:35:33

Get rid of the coin image.  Extremely confusing for newbs.  How about an image of a person scanning a QR code.  Something a new user can/should identify with.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:17:17
I think you were in the minority of intelligent newbies.  At this point we're forced to work with inaccurate terms/analogies like coin and wallet to describe a very difficult concept for which there are no analogies.  Depicting pictures of people hording physical coins with the bitcoin symbol on it only adds to the confusion.  Andreas said it best when he spoke about how wallets should be called "keychains".

Quite a different attitude compared to just a couple of years ago when they used to chuckle at Bitcoin as a joke.   
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:06:12
Ugg.  When will these companies realize they're scaring away curious newbies by not indicating that $20 worth of Bitcoin can be purchased.   
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:57:09
Great question.   As people rush into Bitcoin and adoption grows, I’m getting more concerned about the network being overloaded.   We need lightning!

Why reinvent the wheel?  So much easier to get businesses on board with Bitpay.  Then charge them, similar to what this guy did: 
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:13:34
This is phenomenal!  Touches on all the points I love about Bitcoin, completely for the non-techy!

Exactly.  Anyone can PM me for the address and their website.

Makes me sad to read that.
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:11:56
Thanks, I emailed to suggest that to him.
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:55:41
There's always this business model: 
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:16:43
Absolutely.  I merely mentioned this as more of a thought exercise for him to understand that he didn't need to apply for an account, work through a company or an exchange - which was his previous understanding.
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:19:03
Happy Cake Day!  I added his business to coinmap.org using the instructions in a youtube video I found (tagging it payment:bitcoin  yes) and after a day it's not showing up.  :-(
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:32:26
Then don't link.  Just list businesses by category.
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:00:04
Perhaps they could help their clients increase sales by, I don't know, making a directory of merchants that accept Bitcoin.  ಠ_ಠ
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:13:53
I just don't understand that.  Is it not a win-win for Bitpay and their merchants?  The fact that there are 60,000 merchants mean nothing to me, if the only ones I'm exposed to are the select big name logos on the homepage.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:08:53
The article had me at the 1st paragraph.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:43:32
Bitcoin won't be mainstream to me until the media feels they can stop showing images of casascius coins.  Perfect way to confuse people throughout an otherwise informative segment.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:19:36
If I had gone that route, he wouldn't be accepting bitcoin.  I thought I did my due diligence by telling him this wasn't the best way to generate a key since your computer is online and may be corrupt.  I'm sure I'll be in touch with him over the next few months, so hopefully, if he has any bitcoin business, I'll encourage him to generate a paperwallet securely.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:04:00
Love this man
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:53:18
I like how you can change the quantity to 9,999,999 and check out.  The cost is 4.5x as much as Bitcoin's market cap.

Please reply to each of those with this statement:  
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:56:22
Excellent production quality, but I think you missed the mark as an introductory video.  Many portions are very abstract and hard to grasp for newbies.  You didn't show how easy it is for people to pay/receive Bitcoins, which is a big part of what people want to learn when they say "how does it work?"
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:35:22
Great video, thanks for posting.
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:22:12
I appreciate the offer help, but posting an item on isn't a meta solution to the problem.  
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:24:38
Good reply.   My standard advice is from Andreas, invest an amount that's proportional to your understanding of Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:13:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:02:40
Correction:  We don't fully understand how the fed works AND they have a long history of devaluing the dollar!  We all know exactly how many bitcoins will be around in any given year.

It could be done in a civil way, think about the Canadian Senate Hearing.  Problems were mentioned, then coherently explained.

How do financial experts begin a story about a technology nearly 10 years old with opening remarks about how they don't understand it.   No excuse for that ignorance.   What is Internet?  
And as for Cramer, F-him.   When bitcoin was low or on its way down, he spoke of it as a joke for fools.    Now at ATHs, he's somewhat fascinated by it.   
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:15:06
For people with decades of experience with software written by people/companies, it's hard to grasp the process and benefits of open source code.

What an asshole to be making predictions like that and putting other people's money at risk.   
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:10:22
My obligatory comment: do you only show the exchange price of 1 bitcoin on the main screen?  If so, you should show how much smaller USD increments cost. E.g. $25 = 0.013BTC.  Many people are not aware how divisible bitcoins are and that one does not need to purchase an entire coin.

Excellent article.  
But I can't help but be reminded of all the "What is Internet" articles from the early 90's, saying the internet is only used for computer nerds to send messages to each other.

I wonder how the balance of efficiency changes once you account for the costs of centralized systems and their various organizations, office buildings, utilities, transportation, staff, overhead, taxes, etc.  I think of this every time I see an armored truck leaving a bank.

He's one of many people I'd tag to debate Andreas.  Unfortunately, Andreas hasn't really done head to head debates - as awesome as it would be to watch.

Let's think about repeats of the TV show for a moment.  Could the QR code of the private key be reused?  If the show wanted to, couldn't they just fund the key for each repeat?

Interesting argument.  I'd like to hear more about this argument's pros/cons from those that understand the protocol more than I.

Should add inflation adjusted dollar too, especially since BTC is deflationary.

Good article.  Simple and to the point.

There's only so many transactions that can fit in a block, so even if everyone tipped a whole BTC, they'd still be stuck.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:08:37
I disagree!  If we use Quantum Entanglement to transmit information to/from computers to the Blockchain, transactions could be sent from around the universe without delay.

Here's my plan if they want to regulate:
* 1) Make a database of all possible Bitcoin addresses
* 2) Once step  is completed, then I'll give them all my personal information so they can "protect" me.

The advice should have been, "Do you know what Bitcoin is?   No?   Then don't invest in what you don't understand.   Spend some time learning about cryptocurrency.  Then invest an amount proportional to your understanding of the technology and your risk tolerance."

From my understanding the security comes from the enormous amount of private keys available.  It's something like a 46 digit number.  It's been described as a smaller number than: imagine all the grains of sand on earth, now imagine that each of those grains was another earth, each containing the same number of grains of sand.
