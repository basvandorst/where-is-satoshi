You just tipped someone 0.00032792 USD. You are kidding right?
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:45:13
So if I were to advertise something unsolicited to every user in but attach a 1 Satoshi tip I wouldn't be a spammer rather just a person tipping lots of people?

The website isnt secret, you just have to pay to join it. My point isnt that you should care. Its that paid government agents wouldn't be wasting their time laughing at you in private. So you should probably stop thinking everyone is a secret paid government shill agent. It just makes you look as stupid and crazy as you are.

My argument against tipping such tiny amounts isnt that its virtually pointless (which it is) but rather its insulting. If someone had some way of offering me a fraction of a penny in person and attempted to do so as "Reward" for a useful opinion, idea, or though. Or as a "gift" to entice me into learning about an idea, I would tell them to go fuck themselves for bothering me with what is essentially spam and disguising it as a "gift"/"reward". An actual gift or reward does more for the reciever than the giver. giving me a fraction of a penny is just extremely cheap advertising for bitcoin, not a useful contribution to me.
If I sent spam email with .0000001 cents attached would I still be a spammer, or someone "giving away free money!"??

Thanks so much! just 1 million more generous souls like yourself and I can buy an icecream.

So because regulations dont catch all criminals before they defraud people they are useless? So since all rape isnt stopped before it happens we should just let the rape free market take care of punishing the criminals? Well just give them a rapist tag.
Also as you pointed out in the Madoff case, even when it takes them a long time to catch them, they do a decent job of both punishing people for and clawing back the ill gotten gains of said scheme? Meanwhile im pretty sure Danny Brewster is still loling at bitcoiners as he spends their hard earned coins.
The non bitcoin equivalent of this video being posted to would be if Bernie Madoff were not in jail, but instead on the news extolling the virtues of a certain investment. And people were at home watching going "man I really like what this madoff character is putting down! He seems to be authoritative and knowledgeable on the subject of investments so im gonna go ahead and listen, heck ill even show this video to my friends!"

Who would have thought metaphorically/literally tossing pennies at  people and yelling "bitcoin bitcoin!" would backfire.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:44:07
Then why tip at all? thats exactly the problem that seems to happen. Everyone says "atleast a dollar" but you can go look at changetip stats and see for yourself average tips are somewhere around .21 cents a tip.
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:55:34
19 cents should just about cover all your legal fees right?
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:22:24
This is gentlemen!!! Who's ready for hyperbitcoinitization?
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:50:13
This is the libertarian version of charity right?
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:55:02
Thats exactly my point, even if I was given a 1 satoshi tip from every single subscriber ( which would never happen at 100k+) I would still have less than a dollar in USD which is nearly useless to me. So the idea that 1 Satoshi tips "add up" in any significant way is a bit silly to me. 
Meanwhile, the guy who sent 100,000+ tips has done some very cheap spamming on behalf of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:01:00
Stop thinking that throwing change at rich people is going to do anything but make people think bitcoiners are crazy out of touch pyramid scheming spammers. It reeks of desperation to force adoption by sprinkling pennies on people in an effort to force the mention of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:46:30
if it meant 50,000 messages clogging up my threads, and 50 inbox messages on reddit, and i had to accept each of the 50k, yes absolutely i would turn it down. In the last 2 days ive recieved about 10 tips and they dont even equal 50 cents. Its a joke.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:34:15
Stop being reasonable and understanding how things really work! This is god damnit!
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:10:57
Your incorrect belief people like Tulipcoins are "paid shills" comes from severely underestimating the value of the comedy bitcoiners like you produce. You must assume, "no one would put this much effort into making fun of and laughing at bitcoiners if they werent paid shills!". But let me tell you, you are wrong. Infact, in a given day, the value of the hilarity produced by far exceeds the value of tips given out. Also, bitcoin is filled with paid shills, but its for bitcoin services, companies, and scams (like the tipping account that WORKED for changetip)
FYI, there are private discussions on message boards that people pay to join that are filled with hundreds of pages of discussion on how stupid bitcoin and bitcoiners are. Away from the public, these discussions have been going on for years and years for no reason other than bitcoin is absolutely hilarious if you know anything about technology and economics, or cognitive dissonance, or the history of bitcoin. People such as yourself who tend to be both very vocal in or on bitcointalk and rabidly/blindly pro bitcoin (or just plain old insane) are known by name because they are pretty much constant streams of hilarity. 
You can stop believing in your conspiracy theory that governments and banks actually care enough about bitcoin to try and "astroturf" negative opinions on bitcoin. The truth is the conspiracy is real, but were paid in laughs, and every time you call us a paid government shill its like tipping someone a donut hole in bitcoin. Only not useless.
Or maybe im actually another paid shill?

Please tell me why this isnt true as you downvote my comment. Ill send you a tip.
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:56:35
Because tiny tips are insulting spam.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:58:48
Good thing you didnt use bitcoins to buy or you would be screwed! Wait...
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:04:08
Hey guys, lets all pass around fractions of pennies! 
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:28:16
Coming from the guy who pumped NEO and BEE. lol. I love how without regulations bitcoin is supposed to work on reputation. Yet even known scammers and people like R.Ver and Tuurd that hugely pumped major scams are none the worse for it in the eyes of the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:24:23
So far almost everyone has said "atleast a dollar" and almost every tip in this thread has been fore less than 30 cents. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:45:32
Its almost as if the news bitcoiners pretend is literally the gamechanger of bitcoin and the start of the unstoppable rise to greatness is just a company using bitpay to cash out fiat and put selling pressure on the price.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:55:19
For those thinking that he compared with "twitter" and "facebook" not "twitter tipping" and "facebook tipping" pull your head out of your ass. Throwing dust at a bunch of people on reddit isnt going to make changetip bigger than facebook. Read the screenshot  better. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:07:19
That just makes them even more spammy
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:05:37
Handle more than 6 transactions per second?
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:53:08
except he searched for "facebook tipping" not "facebook" lol
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:59:43
Personally I disagree, I find that someone offering me fractions of a penny to be more insulting and annoying than not trying to give me any money at all. It also leads me to assume their intention was to spam me, not to reward me. As a fraction of a penny tip offers no one any benefit besides "spreading the gospel of bitcoin" 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:52:52
A bit, as atleast I dont have to pay for you. But youre still a leech on society. Just not american society. How does that make you feel? Do you really think you deserve all the benefits of the nation you live in without having to pay any taxes for them? 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:33:41
Except in bitcoin "troll" is code for "people who criticize bitcoin" accusing critics of being trolls and trying to silence them is just an underhanded way of suppressing negative bitcoin truth. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:34:25
Probably because they write posts asking for the brigade to show up in another subreddit at a certain place and time and "make sure the right questions get seen". Then people read that post, and show up.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:08:12


So which taxes dont you pay then?
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:07:18
Youre trying to tell me you cant "be your own bank" with dollars? People do it all the time, except money is probably  safer under a matress than it is in some poorly devised "cold storage" system.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:44:17
Except these "challanges" are only between two different echo chambers. The pumpers and the ancap libs. Is bitcoin awesome for its regulatory free nature? Or for its ability to transform and take over the current regulated monetary system?  I dont know guys but I sure do know one thing, BIT COIN IS AWESOME!
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:07:39
Clarification on your mutually exclusive statements "I pay all the taxes" and "i pay a local electric coop, and not my taxes"
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:15:16
Either you dont know anything about bitcoin, or you dont know anything about modern banking. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:39:28
So you mean taxpayers subsidize your Bitcoin mining and life? You are welcome welfare queen. Enjoy the roads and infrastructure you didn't pay for.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:48:19
So your previous statement was.. a lie?
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:24:18
Itt: dumb bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:13:48
I didnt come up with anything. Its pretty much just a fact. Are you seriously trying to tell me that bitcoin is a "frictionless" way of transferring value? What part about bitcoin is frictionless? Having to send/scan your ID and email it to an unregulated company or meet a shady person in a cafe to buy bitcoins? Having price volatility against usd causing you to have juuust not enough bitcoins for your purchase between purchasing bitcoins and using them. Having to wait 20+ minutes for transactions, which is such an issue people are talking about emailing private keys. I can keep going.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:00:51
The only frictionless part about bitcoin is when hackers steal coins. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:49:20
Yep, the IMF and paypal have hired economic hitmen to destroy bitcoin from the ground up. I am one of them. AMAA
