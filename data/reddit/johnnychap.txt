It has two functions... 
1) It does have its own trade pairs and compares rates to its competitors.
2) For assets it doesn't yet posses reserves for, it shows the cheapest option of transacting and allows you to do the trade without leaving the website, without a fee.
Thanks for your question.

Sometimes i see people referring to pre-public chain mining as premining.
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:10:18
I guess some make the argument that it incentivizes developers and pays for marketing etc, if they amount is small.

Its a hybrid I believe. You can stake or mine. They are talking about moving to full proof of stake.
The premined "coins" currently make up 68% of the current supply. although the majority were sold during the ICO.   The amount of premined coins for the dev fund is like 11% of the current supply.

During fintech week in singapore a few weeks ago, I noticed a bar that had a 20% discount if you paid in crypto. they had like 6 options. 
If you were planning on drinkng there anyway, a way to recover some of your losses
