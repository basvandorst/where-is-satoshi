@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:41
I put all my money in at 100 a coin

A) 100 200 300 were random numbers just like yours.   I've bought at a lot of different price points though and did buy sub 300.
B) I'm sure it is
C) I never said I was a Millionaire

If I bought at 100 200 300 I'm still sitting pretty.
Could have bought in at 15k and still made money.... 10k easily.
There's so many what ifs we can go back and forth all day.  Just buying in at 19k doesn't mean you lost your shirt either.  Could have sold right away.  
I'm still buying BTC... are you?
Buying and selling is doing more than just providing faith.

Its only too volatile when its crashing.
Its so simple.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:13:36
Have fun with your loses
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:35:12
How does it feel to lose your shit and a guy that can't even spell was able to make money?
Ez money
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:12:13
That was only bad if you bought at 19k. Plenty of people made money last year
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:40:57
good thing all my money is in shit coins
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:00:00
especially when you make a post about it right after you do!
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:42:36
No its not.  No one here can relate to paying taxes on gains.

doesn't say anything about getting them to invest in it.
Graphic is titled how to explain it to them.

I tried to explain to my grandma that doesn't have internet at her house and I got a sentence in before she waved me away with her hand.  Stuff like this helps.
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:53:11
everyone and their mother eh? not quite.  I still talk about BTC and the amount of people that have never even heard of crypto is still very high
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:45:57
I think even they take a glance.  
You can make money in a blip if you know what you're doing.  
This little crypto drop doesn't concern me though
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:28:19


yeah stockholders never look at the market when its dumping
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:46:13


I don't disagree.
Hodl might be the worst meme of all time.. I'm not part of that crew family.

@_date: 2018-07-25 07:55:10
I don't think that's true, but you could be right.
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:27:34
Dash and Monero aren't top 10 coins
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:42:36
If you will it dude, it is no dream.

[There are dozens of us... dozens!](
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:04:15
I've never had 5BTC stolen from me by the exchanges I've picked. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:23:00
Just because i can do something doesn't mean I need to.  It took you one minute and you did it for me.  If I cared more I might have looked but I dont.
Are you ok?
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:40:59
I'm not an accountant so I'm lost.. how do they avoid taxes this way?
