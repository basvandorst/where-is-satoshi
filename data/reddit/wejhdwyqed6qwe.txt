Sorry, I'm not Mike.

Yes, that is probably correct. I think someone else acting in this role may be more appropriate.


Yes, it is a tragedy and is one of the problems facing alternate implementations. You have no choice but to port Bitcoin Core, which is itself a moving target. One issue is it may simply not be possible. The developers on Bitcoin Core have been doing a wonderful job lately of reorganizing and cleaning up the code base to include such things as a dynamically linkable library encapsulating the more consensus-critical aspects of the system, namely script evaluation at the moment. The problem as I see it is consensus isn't so neatly defined in all cases. For example, what caused the March 2013 fork came from a source no one considered to be applicable to consensus and yet it ended up being critical to it. Now this isn't to say a better attempt shouldn't be made just that it may never be practically complete.

Amendment to the BIP process proposed by Mike Hearn:
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:42:10
This isn't particularly useful. It's the top 100 people who have submitted a change of any kind to Bitcoin Core. I'm sure it doesn't align with Jeff's definition of major developers.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:52:02
Yes, I saw that and posted about it myself in this thread. On first read I like it. It's at least attempting to come to a tighter definition of the process which would relieve much stress, IMO.
I directly borrowed Mike's "Widgets" term from his email to the list and modified it a bit in my scenario. I am not Mike but thanks for the flattery. The hostile nature of the discussion including various ad-hominem attacks are going to keep me operating as a Nym. Please evaluate my comments only on their merit.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:46:30
Agree. Tighter definition of the process would likely lead to much less stress.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:03:56
What about minor developers? And are the major developers the ones with an imaginary vote in the ill-defined consensus model? In the interest of transparency can you enumerate them please?
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:54:27
I'm not Mike. I'm just a non-outspoken technical participant in the Bitcoin experiment. I was frustrated enough to attempt to engage in the discussion today but it is already too hostile for me. Bye.

Surely you must concede a huge part of the success of the system *is* due to the social contract manifest by adherence to the consensus rules? These rules are coded in software by humans. The machines aren't completely running the show (yet, thank god.)
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:04:12


You misunderstand me I think. The person(s) evaluating the BIPs *doesn't truly have the power*. The participants naturally have the power of veto by virtue of what software they run or which fork they choose to follow.


No, an inadvertent spontaneous hard-fork is much worse and much more potentially damaging than one with a lot of advanced warning containing a slow and methodical roll-out procedure. To say otherwise is FUD, IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:00:20
Sorry, did not mean to imply you were making ad-hominem attacks.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:12:22


This isn't provably true yet. Only a successful hard-fork would indicate that.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:23:12
"I'll know it when I see it" seems to be the definition of "consensus" for bitcoin development. And that's a really shitty/dangerous non-definition.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:12:59
If it could have it would have. This discussion has been going on for about 3 years.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:27:04
And if a unilateral decision by 1 or 2 people puts bitcoin at risk well I mean c'mon then it's just broken and useless by design (which I don't believe.) It makes me question the motives of those who claim M &amp; G are both acting unilaterally and this is somehow dangerous...
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:37:42
Part of the problem in this debate is a reluctance to believe a majority of participants aren't naive or ignorant.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:33:25
I would argue no matter what we decide it's in fact impossible to have 1-2 people control Bitcoin, unless of course they ponied up the some odd hundred millions of dollars required to gain more than 50% of the hashing power on the network.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:48:38
Disagree on the first point. In my opinion, no one having the power *is* the problem. Even if we agreed someone needs to decide, someone else eventually will disagree with this person(s). This is why Mike noted that case, and I'll quote so I don't botch it up:






IMO, a contentious hard-fork must always be an option in case the decision maker(s) is wrong. And it must be carried out in the safest and most responsible way possible. This should be precisely defined.
On your second comment, I can appreciate that position and don't think I disagree but it's not as if the penalty incurred is some sort of demerit or something that can easily be worked around. People will lose money in this scenario, potentially a lot of money.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:35:38
Sure, that would be an amazing feat to accomplish given this much oversight but it *is* possible I suppose. It's also possible enough miners are hacked such that control of greater than 50% of hashing power is achieved. Or some wily tyrant figures out how to create an infinitely repeating EMP bomb, etc etc.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:35:34
The BIP process you refer to does not state how acceptance will happen. It's not a completely defined process. But even if it were what do we do if (and when) it fails?
Imagine this scenario, removing the context, egos, and definition of consensus:
Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave are developing MoneyBits and Alice decides MoneyBits must have Widgets but that would mean breaking consensus at a protocol level with B,C,D. The MoneyBits team copies the BIP process from Bitcoin as written. After several iterations of trying to convince the others via the BIP process, Alice does not get consensus. What is Alice's recourse if she truly believes Widgets are necessary for the long-term viability of MoneyBits? 
Putting it to the network is really the only truly democratic solution to an impasse like the one in my example, IMO.
Further-- let's pretend for the sake of argument Alice is a hopeless megalomaniac, or worse, she's an NSA plant! If Bitcoin can't survive a corrupt agent in the developer community then I mean c'mon, it's broken and worthless by design. I'm flabbergasted that people would actually fear for Bitcoin's stability in the face of 1-2 people acting unilaterally.
