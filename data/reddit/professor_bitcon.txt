The interest you gain from Poloniex is not risk-free, so be careful. If there are strong enough movements in the market, the people who have your bitcoin may lose everything in bad trades and may not have enough collateral to make you whole.

There is a cost in transmitting, storing, and securing a transaction. Bitcoin network stores every transaction in thousands of copies around the world. Given the amount of electricity used to secure the blockchain (the last I heard the estimate was 300 megawatts or so but this was ages ago so it's probably over 1000 MW already). If there are six blocks in an hour and each has 4000 transactions, the mining operation alone has consumed 300,000 kWh of electricity, which means about 12.5 kWh per transaction. Which means that in a network that is so valuable, it makes no sense in the future to try to store transactions that represent a very small value transfer. So you simply can't have all economic activity (directly) on chain. You can push back the problem by growing the blocksize, but eventually somebody needs to pay for the security of the blockchain.
With trustless second-layer solutions we can still use Bitcoin, but without them, we have to trust centralized solutions. For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase and spend it on some services that happen to have wallets there.

Estimate how much electricity was used to mine the block with your transcation. If the amount of energy was divided equally among transactions, calculate how much energy your transaction was worth. Calculate how much you would have paid for that amount of electricity. Is it more than $3?
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:30:07
Yes, but not all second layer solutions are "sort of side-chains". In LN, there is no chain except the Bitcoin blockchain.

I think this is the key point:

The pump still requires money. For any legitimacy, they need to fork BTC which means that current holders will be holders in the fork. Which means that the pump-money ends up in the hands to the people who sell the alt (BTC holders and miners).

If the miners decide to kill BTC and switch over to BCH, plenty of people using BTC for actual commerce are going to be pretty pissed. All activity since the split would end badly for the party holding the BTC. Trust in the "blockchain" would dissipate quickly, as there is nothing that prevents this from happening again. If the miners themselves are holding some BTC, it is likely that most of them are trying to figure out what is the play that maximizes the value of their equipment. If the price drops too much (due to loss of trust in the security and availability of the blockchain), the mining equipment they have might become useless. Some miners looking for short-term gain will surely switch to mining BCH when the BCH chain difficulty readjusts, but I don't expect most to switch, as it would seriously damage the trust in the system. It will be interesting to see what the big players looking to get a monopoly in the area (Bitmain et al) are going to do.

Transactions can be marked final, so that nodes that follow the rules will not allow the transaction to be replaced.
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:19:40
What do you mean by control in this case?
With a correctly implemented LN, the intermediaries do not even know who sent the bitcoin (the sender might be an intermediary) or where it is going (the recipient might be an intermediary) and since most of the transactions would not be settled on the blockchain immediately, there would be an increase in anonymity compared to the current situation.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:42:54
So, what happens now?
The business fork (Segwit2X) has 90% of the hashrate but little support from the Core developers. Arguably they might have the users as well since the average user who uses Coinbase probably has no idea.
The original chain has the developers but might find itself without miners when the business fork activates. If the business fork is cancelled, the original chain might still be viable, but with less security than the business fork.
And then there's BCH trying to gain hashrate. If the business fork is cancelled, Roger Ver is going to switch to mining BCH exclusively. Since Jihan Wu seems to have a serious distrust of the Core developers, maybe Antpool and the related pools will also switch?
To me it sounds like the short term situation might be extremely chaotic and the end result might be the hashrate flowing from one chain to the next, lowering the security of the whole system. Then which chain will be the actual store of value?

Seriously, just pay your taxes and live your life stress-free. I'm quite sure that in the coming years governments are going to be on the lookout for people who didn't pay for capital gains on their cryptocurrency profits. Avoiding taxes is for the really rich people, but you should probably find a tax expert to tell how to minimize your tax burden.

Proof of work makes sure that users can trust that they are receiving actual blocks, as it would be extremely expensive (practically infeasible) for Blockstream to mine blocks to send only to the satellite users. They can of course censor unconfirmed transactions or they can simply not send blocks.

In some places I have heard that the tax authorities classified that as normal income (which would again in many places make the electricity expenses tax deductible). But I think it's a much more ambiguous case and if the tax authorities have not issued any instructions on how to proceed, one might run into problems at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:03:13
No, BCH. Thanks to the EDA, the miners can drop the difficulty considerably by not mining, and then increase the rate at which new BCH is created since the time to find a block goes down as more hashrate switches.
See  the orange dotted line stays the same on average, but the blue dotted line varies wildly. If this keeps going on like this, the long-term average blocktime for BCH will be well below 10 minutes, which means that its inflation rate will be higher.

I would be surprised if some governments weren't actually trying to cause conflict within. I thought this was a rather good summary: [The trust attack] (

In addition, I'd still say it's the valid chain with most cumulative work. I know many use "longest" when they mean "most work", but most people reading these subreddits probably do not understand the difference.

You mean miners will start censoring some Bitcoin transactions? What would be their incentive to do that? And could you explain a bit more how you think they would detect which transaction is a channel open/close by a hub?
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:28:53


I've only seen several free, open source implementations. Also, LN is not a side-chain solution.

In many (most?) jurisdictions you need to pay capital gains tax even if you just spend the bitcoin. This makes it a bit difficult to use since you need to keep track on how much you paid for bitcoin so you can calculate what your income was.

The price is still surprisingly high. I think that the situation is this:
1. A lot of small holders of BCH will not sell because they're afraid that the price goes up and they will lose potential earnings or that BCH will replace Bitcoin and they will lose everything. Or they don't see the potential earnings as big enough to take this risk. Or they have not even heard about this or they don't understand it or consider the gains too small to bother.
2. Some large holders are not interested in selling because they don't want to have to consider security, privacy, and tax implications of selling BCH.
3. A lot of BCH is tied up in Coinbase and other exchanges.
4. A lot of BCH is tied up in GBTC and other instruments (ETNs by XBT Provider, for example)
5. Some confused/bamboozled people are thinking that Bitcoin is suddenly very cheap and they buy BCH since it has "Bitcoin" in its name.
6. Margin trading is not available for BCH on all exchanges (e.g. Kraken), which means that price discovery is limited.
The result of this is that the "total supply" of BCH is a lot smaller than one would expect and therefore easier to manipulate than many other altcoins. Roger Ver has been buying some BCH and has been discussing with some big holders to make a bigger move (

Definitely not the majority. To me it seems that it was mostly businesses doing a deal, so it would be a "business fork". The amount of users these companies serve is still formidable.


That is what I would hope as well, but it does not look like things are going to go smoothly. I expect that at least some of the mining pool operators will throw a fit, no matter what happens. And I think the media will manage to produce a good pile of Bitcoin obituaries in the next few months.

You can short the coin at an exchange before doing the attack.

They should have enabled merged mining, but that would have meant that they would have been happy to coexist with Bitcoin.

My guess would be that then you would pay income tax based on the value you received it AND capital gains tax when you spend it (using the price when you received it as the cost basis). But again, I don't know about the law in the UK.

The difficulty is adjusted by the timestamps on the blocks. But the miners choose the timestamp themselves. You could start creating an alternate history of Bitcoin by simply backdating the blocks. If you want to keep the history believable, you will need to make sure it's better (more work) than the original. You don't need many ASIC miners to do this in a rather short time. If you don't want to keep it convincing, just make the blocks look like the whole network hashrate is small.
Bitcoin Core client wouldn't be (temporarily) confused by an alternate history, as it has a few checkpoints (such that it only accepts a certain block hash at certain height). This is not a security feature, but a performance optimization, as it would eventually find the right chain anyway.

You're mixing Segwit with Lightning Network (and other second layer solutions that work better with the malleability fix).

They might be locking in the value by shorting on the exchanges. If I wanted to appear to have confidence in the BCH, I would avoid moving mined coins as long as possible.
