Hoarders prove that Bitcoin is moving away from their glib fake desire for cryptocurrency economy. How csn it be a viable currency when it is only hoarded &amp; when majority id held by so very few? What's next? Bitcoin IMF boardroom hoarding types? And sitting on their millionaire asses and trashing other alt coins? Wait. This already happened among Bitcoin snobs.

Exactly! It is not even holding. Bitcoiners are hoarding! And they still insist on it being a world currency of choice? Abject delusion has already set in among Bitcoiners. They now have no intention of spending it. They are hoarding it like early gold miners hoarded their little gold nuggets.

So it is an investment? Not a viable fiat replacement? Hoarders are now synonymous with Bitcoin pushers.

Historically in real estate &amp; stock bubble, hoarders are the panic sellers who end up bursting the bubble. Hoarders are not investors. They never are. They hoard looking for the price to keep going up. Hoarders have little interest in taking reasonable "take profits" or spending their profits.

Truth? LOL worthy comment. Subjective opinions are some objective truths?

What a pointless babble! Rules of basic Econ 101 always apply when human greed is involved. Hoarding leads to bubble bursting &amp; eventual crumble. Time will come when smart traders will sell &amp; short the BTC market. The dimwitted ones will be holding the cheap to worthless bitcoins.

Yes but it is a fake worthless commodity. Some bizarre artificial public clamoring demand inflated its imagined worth. It is 100% unlike other real world commodities like gold, silver, or copper. And now add the aspect of hoarding &amp; it will never be a currency.

Failure is imminent because of hoarding &amp; bizarre limited availability. Bitcoin pushers still pushing for currency usage are now being very delusional. It is now in just hoarding stage.

Exactly! But your correct view are falling on deaf ears! Hoarding does not create value. Step back a bit &amp; the valuation of Bitcoin is really laughable &amp; built on deck of cards! It is not even a usable commodity! Sliver of copper has more real world uses as a genuine commodity!

No! In reality the "value" of Bitcoin is even more sad. It is all artificial &amp; imagined. You just indirectly stated that Bitcoin has no real value.

We all know Bitcoins are being hoarded. You have to distrust people who tell you otherwise. Core economic rules always come into play sooner or later. Meaning when everything is built only on supply &amp; demand, it eventually crashes. BTC is worse due to finite number. Keep economic 101 in mind always.

In Bitcoin world, there is no such thing as "saving". It is either hoarding or spending.

Thumbs up for your view! Hoarding is the beginning of an end.
