You did not call my argument stupid, your exact words were "you're too dumb.". Then you proceed to cop out by not even backing up your claims.

If the currency is backed by gold, then it *must be exchangeable* for gold, that's the definition.  It also does not address the expansion of wealth problem and I don't see how "incredible financial riches" directly follows.

They are not at the top like we are.

Correct, and that's not even considering that you actually have to mine for gold to create more wealth, and it's a finite resource.  The only way to have more buying power is if $1 in gold will buy more over time and that would be dictated by supply and demand.  However, that would destroy consumer markets as many would just hoard (similar to having high interest rates).

Our currency is secure and so is our nation precisely because of our debt. I've explained this in a few other threads, but I'll do it again:
We have the mightiest military in the world, and that coupled with a large national debt to friends and foes alike is actually great national security and fiat security. Our friends and foes are deeply invested in the dollar because of our debt, so all those that hold our debt have a huge interest in keeping the dollar from collapsing. The threat of our huge military also backs our currency, after all, the value of fiat is largely tied to the state's stability and power in the world. It boils down to us keeping our military strong, our debt "healthy," and the dollar as the world standard in the fiat marketplace.

No, you called me dumb, that's childish.

I highly doubt it, but we can agree to disagree.

Also, this is the same "genius" that convinced congress to pass a bill allowing for social security to be considered a revenue, and therefore spent instead of saved.  It magically turned a deficit into a surplus.

Stop being an ass and have a civil convo like an adult.

Senile old man, this can never work in a global market.  It's either all or nothing, meaning all countries do it or no countries do it.  You can't have a few or one country doing it in a fiat marketplace because the gold would last for exactly 1 day, there would be a run on it from the fiat countries.
