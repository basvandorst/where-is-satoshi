I've done a bit of investigating, and here are your legal options: 
There was some funny business with that post, so for safety, here are the relevant parts:
[**Note for mods**: I have not 'doxxed' anyone in this post. All of this information is publicly available on the Australian Company Register.]
Some interesting facts and advice for those who find themselves in the same situation (**disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice**):
Our EFTs go to a bank account owned an Australian company '13th Pty Ltd' (ACN: 160 051 990), so these transaction are subject to Australian Consumer Law (the [ATO classifies bitcoins as 'goods']( rather than currency). 
I hope that is aware of these facts, and has made the directors of '13th Pty Ltd' (Amit &amp; Shivani Taneja) aware of them too. If not, he may be interested to know that by omitting the fact that they were unable to supply within a timely manner, '13th Pty Ltd' have probably engaged in ['misleading or deceptive conduct']( which is prohibited by [section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law]( 
There are some pretty good arguments that they have also breached more specific provisions of the Act too. For instance Sub-Section 36(3) of the ACL ('Wrongly Accepting Payment') states:










may also be interested to know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't go after people because they are 'big fish', but because the breach relates to a novel situation or a new 'wild west' market (reasoning that a big public example will deter future misconduct of the same kind). The penalties range from: 
* fines in the tens of thousands of dollars 
* director disqualification for long periods of time (i.e. can't start or run a company for 10 years)
* up to criminal prosecution and imprisonment. 
On an unrelated note, does Australia have extradition treaties with your current country of residence, or any countries you are likely to travel to To anyone in a situation like mine, here's my advice (keep all records and receipts btw):
* First exhaust the possibility of resolving this through regular 'customer service' channels (like I have)
* Write a ['complaint letter']( addressed to the directors of 13th Pty Ltd (Amit &amp; Shivani Taneja). Send this letter, via **registered** snail mail to 13th Pty Ltd's 'principle place of business': 15A Ramsay Avenue, SEACOMBE GARDENS SA, 5047.
If this doesn't resolve the situation, you have the option of doing one, or any combination of:
* Going to small claims court and getting (what will likely be) a 'default judgement' (basically a court order saying the company must pay you the money they owe). If they don't cough up (likely, given past experience), engage the South Australian Sheriff's Office to repossess property from their 'principle place of business' which can be sold to cover your debt and pay Sheriff fees.
* Write letters of complaint to your State and the SA Offices of Fair Trading, who may commence investigations.
* Write letters of complaint to the ACCC, who may consider the situation 'novel' enough to commence court proceedings against 13th Pty Ltd (and, depending on severity, prosecution of those connected to the company, potentially even prosecutions *in absentia*).
* If igot owe you more than $2000, you can issue a letter of 'statutory demand' under section 459E of the Corporations Act 2001, which requires them to pay you within 21 days. If they don't pay up within that time, you can then apply to a court to have the company 'wound up' (essentially, the company is presumed insolvent and placed into voluntary administration, and is often eventually liquidated). This also applies if you go the small claims route and get a judgement in your favour (for an amount of $2000), but its probably more in your personal interests to just get your money back by repossessing and selling their stuff.
 
Once last thing Given the company we've all been transacting with is (a) an Australian registered company with (b) all 100 shares held by 4 individuals, 3 living in Australia (75% Australian share ownership), how does your business model work exactly? 
I assume 13th Pty Ltd is effectively controlled by some offshore company. How do you transfer profits from this Australian subsidiary, owned entirely by individuals, to a foreign head company with no actual share ownership (and therefore no access to dividend distribution)? At least, barring some kind of transfer-pricing scheme? I also note that 13 Pty Ltd is registered for GST, yet does not apply GST to their transactions. Might want to take note of stuff like [this](
**followup post**
Like others here, my guess is that igot have cashflow problems and are trying to buy themselves some time to 'right the ship'. I hope this isn't the case, for two reasons:
* If they're actually being truthful, we'll get out money back eventually.
* Knowingly trading while insolvent is a very serious **criminal** offence under the Corporations Act. Penalties are levied against company directors personally (i.e. they 'pierce the corporate veil'), and can include: $440,000 in fines, direct liability to compensate creditors, and up to 5 years imprisonment.
Essentially, the directors of 13th Pty Ltd could be saps who find themselves bankrupt and in prison for simply being unaware (which is a shaky legal defence btw, as directors have legal obligations to remain informed about their company's financial position).  
Some time this week I plan to write to the directors of 13th Pty Ltd (copying in ASIC), to make sure they **are** aware. This serves a dual purpose: it's possible they're being kept in the dark, and it means they cannot claim in subsequent criminal proceedings they were unaware of their company's financial position.

I feel your pain mate. I'm in the same situation here and support are now ignoring me. 
I wrote a long post [here]( outlining your possible options. If you main objective is getting the money back, small claims court is probably the fastest route (and not as difficult as many would believe, often the 'other side' doesn't even show up and you get a default judgement). 
EDIT: Oh that's nice, they deleted my post. Didn't even bother to give me a reason. Guess I shouldn't have spent those two hours researching Australian consumer and corporate law. Any paying $9 to ASIC to pull igot's (13th Pty Ltd) company records.
EDIT2: Nope, it's back. That was weird.
EDIT3: Wrong again, looks like I've been shadowbanned from that sub.
