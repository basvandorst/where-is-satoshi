OK, finally I found the answer. It is 42 !

@_date: 2016-08-06 06:04:47
The second clue is dead.
When I succeed the first time, I arrived on a pdf of the Rootstock white paper. I tried but couldn t resolved this one, and thougth that thzre was a risk that somebody could change the clue, to put me on a bad way. So I decided to turn it in a joke to show the limits of this game. I like solving problems, but I want to be sure that there is no failures.
Then, when I posted the first answer, somebody transformed it again for something else. The game is dead now.

Your Lightning channel will be the equivalent of your paycheck in your bank. No need to close it. You will open it just once and will pay everything on the Lightning Network. The majority of Bitcoin transactions will be on the Lightning Network and the fees will be lower.

Raiden is a token, you have to buy it to use it, it is absolutely not the same technology.
Also, Ethereum tries to execute all the smart contracts on the first layer, it is in opposition with the Bitcoin approach. You should read again the article and maybe you will understand the parallel with Internet and why all the computers of the world don't store the selfie and your lambo when you send an email to your mum.
Bitcoin's goal is to be designed like this :
- LEVEL 0 : Unbreakable protocol to store &amp; move value. This Layer is the root, it is expensive to avoid coffee spam.
- ---&gt; LEVEL 1 : Lightning Network : Instant payment, use the Blockchain for trust
- ---------&gt;LEVEL 2 : Smart contracts. Use Lightning Network for fast payements.
- -----------------&gt;LEVEL 3 : We could imagine deeper layers for infinite possibilities, like internet.

Developping a solid technology takes time, we have the best devs on Bitcoin, fortunately they are smart enough to choose the good development path to prepare the future. You should try Lightning Network, it is available right now and if you are a minimum tech aware, it will blow your mind.
You should read this article to better understand why blockchains needs to scale on multiple layers:

Bitcoin is up to 108741% in five years
Unless stocks and bonds, you can pay things and sell it instantly for cash everywhere in the world.


They are speculating on the future of Bitcoin. And you can buy things with bitcoin today, please try with another coin.
If you tried the Lightning Network, you would stop to talk about Fees. Please try the Eclair Wallet on Android (Lightning Network test net wallet), then sell your altcoins.
You can also try Zap Wallet or Lightning wallet on desktops.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:17:19
- 1/ Install Eclair Wallet on Android :
(you can also use Lnd or Zap Wallet on Win/Linux/Mac if you prefer)
- 2/ Send some Testnet coins to your Eclair Testnet wallet from here :
- 3/ When your Testnet Bitcoin are confirmed, open channel with autoconnection on Eclair.
Now you can use Lightning on testnet, let's try it :
- 4/ Go on Starblock and buy a coffee :

You can use it actually at a store of value. It works great actually.
If you want to use it as a currency, wait a few month for the Lightning Network. Transactions will be instant with very low fees. If you want a preview, install the Eclair Wallet on Android and do some tests. I am sure you will feel much more confident about the future of Bitcoin after that.

It is not about fragmentation, Ethereum evolves much faster than bitcoin, it is just a fact. It can be dangerous because of the wide attack surface, but in this world, you need to take risks to evolve and find the good path. The slow dev of bitcoin could kill it, because the hype will move on another technology very soon. We touched the mainstream news now, and medias will start the altcoin shill very soon

I try to read the github, but I don't really know where to watch, there is too much informations for a non developer.
The community should stop sending the lambda guys like me on Github. I am not sure these kind of informations are useful for us (last modifications) :
- Make default issue text all comments to make issues more readable
- Explicitly search for bdb5.3.
- Rename rpcuser.py to rpcauth.py

But when my payment channel is empty, is it possible to reload it with more btc or I need to create a new channel ?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:24:52
The channel was offline when I tried to close it, and the state is effectively "Closing uncooperative". So, I just need to wait for 144 blocks ? I can survive to that , especially with the testnet coins.
I closed two more channels (the channel was normal this time), and it worked like a charm.

Thanks for your answer. It make sense and will be probably very user friendly in the end. But if I understand well, we should quickly see monopoles and loose decentralisation because merchants will connect to the most famous payment channels to be sure to access to a majority of people.

You could use Rootstock as mentioned in my last message. It use solidity.You have to create a smart contract linked to the bitcoin blockchain. It is very new, so there isn't a lots of informations yet. It is the same programmation language that Ethereum (solidity).
If you want to be "pure" bitcoin layer one,  
there is less possibilities than ethereum because Bitcoin choosed a more safe approach, and the more complex usage will arrive on lower layers (like Lightning Network). But I think your problem can be solved with bitcoin scripting.
You should check this page for some examples :
The LockWithPublicKey contract could be a beginning.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:16:21
More layers will arrive then, it is how you build a protocol. Other altcoins didn't understand that yet.
@_date: 2019-10-08 08:20:30
How do you check the total number if you can't check the transactions ?
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:39:59
I read again your first post and maybe there is a much easier way to achieve this.
If you just need an alert when funds are moving from a specified address, it is really easy. You have a lots of services that offers that (I personnaly use Cointracking that is probably overqualified for this).
You should search a Wallet watcher. For example  offers that for free I think. You register a public address (not private !!!!!) and will receive an email when the funds moves.
You can try Sentinel Wallet on Android also. I use it to monitor my public adresses.

Craig lies to downplay Dave and Phil's involvement, and write so much with so much ego that he can do a lots of mistakes, but if you read the whole thing, you will find a solid story.
Craig is probably a genius idea stealer. He was an online poker player and was looking for an anonymous solution to avoid the huge fees on credit cards / wire transfer / or taxes.
He stole the ideas from Wei dei, Adam Back and Nick Szabo to build an electronic money. He tried to mix theses ideas and started a white paper, but he couldn't code and the concept didn't work yet. So he asked his friend Dave Kleiman to help him. Dave couldn't solve the double spend problem. He asked Phil Wilson to join the team. Phil had some very very fresh and creative ideas, he solved the double spend problem and coded a big part of bitcoin (probably with Dave).

But locking funds doesn't seem a good idea in my opinion. Money needs to move, to be liquid. I hope that bitcoin fees will not be to high, because peoples will need to open and close channels easely and with a low cost (with the help of channel factories maybe ?).

I am not an expert, but I think you should compare inputs &amp; outputs, right ?
Inputs are still growing, and outputs are shrinking because of batching.

I think it is a Ledger problem : it looks like there is a lots of inputs.

LN is good because it will allow fast payment at a low cost for bitcoin and it will help a lot for global adoption.

The softwares are open source, the 2 companies exists for a long time now and have an economic interest to be absolutely secure. Because it is 2 well known enterprises, they can't disappear without facing big troubles with justice.

I think Wright had the idea (stole the main part from Szabo) then asked Kleiman to work on it (he probably solved the double spend problem with adding proof of work and blockchain idea). I really don't like this Satoshi team and would definitively prefer the Szabo + Finney team, but unfortunatly there is more and more evidence that it is not the case.

Jjdub7,  you are writing this comment in 2016 and I created this wallet at the begining of 2013.  There wasn t so much hacks at this moment and I was less aware about security. Anyway,  I think it was very secure because :
- my wifi password was strong
- my wifi was hidden
- my wallet was in an hidden truecrypted file
- my computer wasn t connected to the wifi (I have 2 computers) 
Today I use a cold wallet (and most important,  I remember my passwords)
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:31:05
I am not paranoiac, I just care about my money. I start to have an important amount of btc and don't want to lose it because of a new Mtgox or Dao hack. Theses technologies &amp; services are still new, and we still have fragile protection.
Also, if I need to use a very complex system to protect my bitcoin, it is not ready for mainstream and it is loosing a lots of interest in my eyes.
I want to add that robust protection systems are never complex. Complexity means larger surface to hack.
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:37:55

3 years ago,  I forgot the password of my wallet. I tried to brute force it (I remembered some parts)  but with no success.  I thought it was  dead and was very angry because the price was rising high at this moment. 
 I stopped to think about it.  And one day (2 month after)  I had an illumination : the wallet password was just my wifi password....
My 2 cents : try your wifi password or hypnose.

When you loose your password,  you feel effectively stupid,  but when I created my wallet at this time,  I just tried bitcoinqt and didn t understand it very well yet.  It was an experiment for me and didn t expect to have so much money in such a short time on it.
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:27:20
It is all about probability : the probability to be hacked with bitcoin is currently higher for the average user.
You don't have to convince me about the utility of Bitcoin. I have 90% of my wealths are in bitcoin. I note just that we still have a problem of security &amp; ergonomy to solve. We need a complete simple trustless system. We just have a part of it for the moment.

Maybe a good solution, Mycelium + Ledger :

I found also the open source of Ledger app. It should be possible to compile the app, but I am not a nerd and don't have time for that :
