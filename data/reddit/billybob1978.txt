Great interview.  I believe he is wrong about it going to 30 dollars and back to 25 cents though.  I do not believe it went below $2 ever again.  (except for the mt gox hack where the hacker sold the whole order book down to a penny).

Germany said it would take in 800k this year and 500k each year after.  Factor that in with a population that doesn't reproduce as much as the invaders and you have a culture that will be replaced.  Although I expect some fireworks before Europeans let that happen.   People like you also laughed when others warned about London becoming minority British.

I said forced.   Whites are the only ones who are forced to accept (and pay for) their own displacement. If diversity and multiculturalism is so great you wouldn't have to force it.   Only when something is too white do people say it needs diversity.  White progressives are the only group ever in the world that actually welcome their own countries to become overrun.   Even if it's by Muslims that would throw them from rooftops.   Better than being a racist!

Yeah its seems this is always the answer progressives tell me. Then I look and there are more Chinese than ever, More Black Africans than Ever, More Indians than ever.  So no your "mixed up" world isn't happening.  The only people targeted for this "mixing up" are countries with majority white populations.  Whites are a tiny portion of the worlds population. Nice try tho.  You guys must read from the same script or all learn from the same anti-white professors.
Edit for fun:  Can you list all the non white countries that are throwing their borders open and importing millions of people that do not share their cultures (or races).  Since this multicultural thing in inevitable, surely this is happening all over right?

While I do not think its anywhere near that number I do believe this thing is bigger than bitcoiners want to admit. 
Check their fb pages.. check the youtube video's.. check all the comments.  Even if its just 20 - 50000 new people coming into bitcoin and needing to buy, that does have an effect.
For the downvoters: There are lots of videos on youtube with MMM people all over the world showing people how to set up wallets.  There are lots of videos of conferences like this all over youtube.  Notice the bitcoin logo  on the banner on the right.

This bubble is different than the others.  First off it didn't end with bad news, followed by more bad news (first bubble popping without Gox problems).  Second off there wasn't a huge ponzi going on where people were demanding bitcoin.  Most Bitcoiners refuse to accept that this ponzi has any effect, but there are hundreds of videos like this online where people have thousands of dollars worth of BTC being paid to them.  I don't think the "despair" phase will last as long this time.  Just my opinion.

America was based on European immigrants you tend to leave that part out.  It wasn't until 1965 that the floodgates really opened.   
There is no proof at all that the more diverse a human population becomes the more "resilient" it becomes.  If that was the case, Brazil would be a Utopia and Japan would be a hellhole.  As the US has become more "diverse", the more shitty it becomes.

Noone else on the world is asked to have open borders except whites.  Wanting to preserve your heritage and way of life from invaders is not something limited to white people.

Really? Apparently in your libertarian (liberal?) dream world no humans have ill intentions towards others?  Noone wants to take anything from others?  
You say laws wont be effected by open borders, but you dont say how laws are created in the first place.  Who makes the laws? Is it by voting? Who can vote everyone?  Mexicans are natural libertarians!  This is why you can't answer cause it makes absolutely no sense. 
I'm a realist you live in a dream world.  Usually its mainly only brainwashed whites that push for open borders or very rich whites like Roger Ver, or (who seems to really love Saudi Arabian culture and Islam for some reason).  They are rich enough to live far away from the "diversity" so they wont be effected by their actions of course, just like liberals that call for diversity and multiculturalism tend to live far from it. . 
I do love my nice quiet,  safe, and crime free neighborhood.  Unlike you I do not feel the need to have 200 Somalians running through the center of town to make myself seem "tolerant" and "hip"
