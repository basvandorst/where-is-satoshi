That's an idea. Engraving is a bit complex but it looks like etching brass is a relatively simple thing to do. I could etch the QR code and the wallet numbers too.

I buried my cold storage in different spots and my wife knows where they are.  I have 3 and they they're sealed inside sections of PVC pipe.  I buried them because I want them to be protected in case of a house fire - fireproof safes are one thing but they're not perfect.
Inside each pipe is everything someone will need to extract the coins; paper wallet, 3d printed QR codes, and a USB stick with the info.  On the USB stick are 3 partitions (just in case this is the distant future and nobody has a computer that can open a particular partition technology like FAT32) and on each partition is a text file with the keys, as well as a PNG and JPEG of the QR code.
I should probably put a note in my will at least saying what these things are and where they are so if both of us die our kids will have a chance of digging them up.  I don't actually want to tell the kids because you know what they'll do.

Yeah I figure I'm going to dig them up in a few years to check on them.  I could verify that the USB sticks are still readable then or even just put in new ones at the time.
There are other methods in there - I printed the paper wallet on my laser printer, laminated it and then vacuum sealed it.  I also vacuum sealed the other stuff, and filled the whole container with desiccant.

Yes, but the pipe *should* be waterproof. It's the same stuff that sewage pipes use and I glued both ends. 
Anyway I laminated the paper, vacuum sealed it and filled the pipe with desiccant.
