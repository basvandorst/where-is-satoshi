Interesting. I thought the CME was supposed to make the price go even higher.

Yeah, Coinbase down again. What a surprise!!! Wonder if the price of something increased or dropped significantly and it "broke" again.

Hard to call it a correction when people can't do anything on 2 of the largest exchanges.

Now back to 16,900. Goddamnit, fuck you gdax\coinbase.

lmao this twitter account is hilarious. It's amazing what people spend time creating in their spare time.

GPU and memory. It has been a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:28
Cool. 15.2k now. Who knows what would have happened if some shady fucking nonsense didn't happen to Gdax\Coinbase like it does every time the price rises significantly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:24
No, I was never able to do anything the moment it hit 19k, and I haven't been able to since. They are still down now even.

Gotta love Gdax\Coinbase being trash yet again and ruining this. Back down to 16,800 now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:35
Why would it matter...
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:16
Is gdax down again? I can't do anything

Gemini sucks if you use a credit union\bank they don't know. They then force you to do a wire transfer which costs $$$. Otherwise, it would be perfect.

Pretty unbelievable. I thought you guys would get a kick out of this BS lol.

What about selling BTC and depositing into your bank? Gdax -&gt; Coinbase -&gt; your bank?
