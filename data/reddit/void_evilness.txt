Paypal hates crypto so no exchange can use payapl for their services :( need to go p2p like local bitcoins if you want to use paypal

They arent discouraging the use, the fees were high lately, especially during the chaos and we are saying why pick the worst time to spend small amounts of BTC when u have other currencies to avoid the damage?
For example, if the thing OP wanted to buy was $20 all he has to do is pay by creditcard and he pays $20. End of transaction. He paid with bitcoin so now OP paid $28 for the thing. Why ?

Yeah but that's super long run. Doesn't explain what's happening right now. also if bitcoin is deflatory and fiat is inflatory, doesnt it sort of balance out? The intrinsic value is th same right
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:35:56
No it's not

What? What's so difficult about entering their wallet address on your own wallet and entering the amount you want to send?
