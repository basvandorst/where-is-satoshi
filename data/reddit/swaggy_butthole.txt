But if it can make free transactions, why would it be a shitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:26:38

@_date: 2018-02-21 22:58:15
Well yeah... I'm pretty sure there isn't a single person that'd dispute that. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:57:53
No. That is illegal. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:56:41

@_date: 2018-02-20 20:21:43
