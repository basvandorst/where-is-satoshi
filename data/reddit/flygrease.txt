Mostly. 
Pin=wallet access
Password/pin=wallet access
Passcode=24 word seed phrase
Privatekey=private key
I’m trying to imagine scenarios where I can lose my bitcoin and then overcome that. 
I hold the passcode or private key in a lock box or other secret place. I also hold a wallet w a 5 digit PIN. I then 
Lose the wallet. No big deal, buy another wallet and set it up w private key and 24 word passcode
Lose private key and passcode. Bank drilled the lock box. House burned down whatever. Can I then buy a new wallet with new private key and passcode and send bitcoin to it from original wallet?
If I forget PIN. How do I get access to wallet without key or passcode. I assume they are then lost. 
I’m also imagining a scenario where I die and beneficiaries need info. How do I get that to them without disclosing private key in a will or trust document.

My understanding is the private key is the multiletter or number gobbledygook and passcode I is the 24 pass words. 
What is the correct terminology in How I think of those?

Great answers. I don’t plan on relying on a HWallet without seeds just seeing if it is outright unrecoverable. It also means that coins are only protected by your PIN should the HW get stolen. That is between the time you transfer to a new HW. 
My worry is with the seeds or 24 passcodes. I can’t figure a fool proof way to not have a tiny risk of losing them or having them compromised. 
I had a bank lock box drilled one time. And they have limited protection. 
Hiding and storing keys present their own problems. And relate to the question of beneficiary access once you die. It’s not easy. 
Hodl and tell no one (beneficiary problem) 
Or allow access to key in some way and risk compromise of assets. 
Memorization has similar issues and not an option for most. 
If I role play it’s cash or physical gold. There’s a similar problem so it’s not just bitcoin. 
Compare those risk probabilities to holding at coin base. Mt Gox risk all over again but so far they seem legit. Still, not you keys not your coins.

What passwords are needed to send money from my wallet?
If I don’t need the 24 word password or the key then if those get lost I can still send money to another wallet and create a new key and 20for a password?
In other words if I keep the passwords or key separate from the wallet I can lose one but not the other and still get access to my bitcoin?

Do you need the 24 word passcode to send money?  If not could you simply send yourself your balance should you lose your 24 word passcode?
As long as you have either wallet or passcode or both you haven’t lost balance. Is that correct?

I meant without GBTC. Own that now but would rather own direct and save the 30% premium.
