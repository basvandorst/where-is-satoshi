I read the paper, that is why I asked not to be pointed to it. Its the source I don't want to read.
Maybe I missed the part of the 8 page paper that explains what the block data structure looks like and what exactly gets hashed and how many zeros need to be at the front of the hashed value ... Etc etc.

The transactions should never have been confirmed.  It is a flaw in the bitcoin protocol.

So you admit you're now in possession of stolen property, and you are aware that you are in possession of stolen property.  This is a crime in most countries.
Here is how this will play out.  Companies will begin to refuse to complete transactions when they are sent stolen coins.  Companies do not wish to be associated dealing in stolen property, and will also have a hard time exchanging them for local currency because the exchanges will refuse to accept them also.  Your overstocks, and tigerdirects, and ISPs, and whomever else takes bitcoin will simply refuse to honor your business and return the coin to you or possibly even report you to the authorities.  You now hold possession of coin that cannot be used for transactions by a legitimate businesses.  
Sucks to be you, but the tainted coins become significantly devalued.

Auditors. Both security and financial.  If they were getting sucked dry in 2011 then an audit would have picked it up. Hire a fucking big 6 firm and they will do both as they stick their nose up you ass, but at least there would have been third party verification of their books.

Once a system is implemented, and if the coins are blacklisted, then yes.
And it would be in everyone's best interest, before completing a transaction (or to even allowing the transaction to continue) to determine if the coin is currently blacklisted.  So nobody would ever accept coins that are on a blacklist. 
It wouldn't be a matter of finding out the coin was stolen somewhere in its history, it would become a matter of knowing the coin was blacklisted and never accepting it.  The coins would be poison to the holder, because nobody would ever accept them.
And frankly, this doesn't even need to be part of the protocol.  A significant number of people could decide to blacklist these Mt. Gox coins. They would forever be tainted.  And if sufficient users refuse to accept them knowing that there was a history of theft in the block chain, their value would be greatly reduced.
I would participate in this.  I would absolutely refuse to complete any transaction with a current blacklisted coin.

Simple.  If somebody sent me, as a 'legitimate business operation', bitcoin for a product or exchange for cash, and the block chain showed tainted coins, then I wouldn't complete the transaction.  If they chose to sue me, I would let the court know that the coins sent were tainted and on record as being stolen and I refuse to do business in stolen funds. If they provided me a charge-back address, I would return the coins to them. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:06:56


Why bother? Kill it.
I would, however, like to see all of the coins stolen be blackballed.  That technology should exist, and the thieves should not be able to profit from their crimes.  You say "they will use anonymyzers" and the simple solution is to blackball any coins that go through anonymyzing services when those coins go in.  Force those services to blackball those coins by punishing other people who participate in something that the criminals can take advantage of.  Make this a completely losing proposition for the thieves.

They weren't legitimate buyers; they bought stolen property.  The person who sold them did not have legal ownership, and could not legally sell the property.
If you buy the golden gate bridge from somebody who claims to have legal title, and shows you legal title, and it turns out to be fraudulently gained title from the previous owner .... you don't get to keep the bridge.

@_date: 2014-03-20 22:28:58
I am aware of that.  But I believe that if the property was not gained by legal means, then the last legal owner of the property should be allowed to recover.  We have a public record of all transactions, and we should take advantage of that.  Possession alone should not be the sole determinate of ownership, and the law (at least in the U.S.) recognizes that.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:41:35
I don't have a readily available public ledger of every serial number of every dollar bill that I can cross reference to determine if at one point in the chain of possession it had been gained illegally through theft or fraud.  And I hate to tell you, but many people who conduct legitimate business operations consider this a drawback of cash: it's easily stolen and once lost, it is very hard to regain.
But this does exist in electronic transactions.  It is trivial to prevent stolen funds from continuing to change hands.  Checks are stopped, credit cards put on hold, bank accounts frozen.  And guess what?  People and businesses like that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:54:14
It doesn't. Its a basic tool for development to find changes, roll them back, and help prevent internal attacks by being able to hunt down code placed intentionally to defraud. If some coder adds a clever way to skim bitcoin, he would never know who did it after the fact.

Well no, it was framed as a question of law.  
Listen child.  I could try and have a conversation with you about math.  And I could try and frame a formula in the form of an algebraic explanation that most any 8th grader could understand.  But you, with your limited third grade skills would laugh at me for putting symbols like X and Y in the formula, saying you clearly know that those are not numbers and thus I must be full of shit.  I could try and teach you, but I won't bother because you're not worth my time.
Go take your pithy insults elsewhere, and try to be more open minded to listening to people who have more knowledge than you do.

Are we forgetting that Aaron Swartz committed a crime, and was being held accountable for it.  The only person who killed Aaron Swartz was Aaron Swartz.   MIT was only doing what it felt was the proper thing to do.  Maybe if Swartz handn't broken the law, he would still be alive today.
You might as well also blame MIT for any MIT student who committed suicide because they couldn't handle the pressure of MIT.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:05:12
MIT shouldn't treat him differently.  That would be even worse than what they did.
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:25:53


Mens rea is not about the motivation behind committing a crime.  Mens rea is about the intent to commit the crime.  A person has to have a 'guilty mind'.  What that means is that the person has to be able to be aware of what he is doing and its outcome.  
You might be able to argue a mistake of fact if Aaron believed he had legitimate access to the equipment, thus invalidating the intent to commit a crime.  But he hid what he was doing.  He tried to hide his face, and he hid the laptop inside the closet.  No jury is going to believe that he wasn't aware that what he was doing was illegal.  WHY he was doing it is irrelevant.  They just needed to show he had intent to act in the manner as he did (mens rea) and also acted in a manner that was illegal (actus reus).  


No it isn't.  That's just plainly ignoring the facts and history of cyber-crime.  The largest sentence ever given to anyone for cyber-crime was a credit card hacking ring leader who got twenty years for stealing millions of dollars.  Jeremy Hammond, who had a long history of previous arrests, got ten years in prison for breaking in to Stratfor.  
The most he realistically face if he was convicted was a few years in prision, and realistically it probably would have only been up to a year.  &gt;&gt;NOT 35&lt;&lt;.  
It is being completely disengenous to say he was facing 35 years in prison.  He faced 35 years in prison no more than I face winning MegaMillions or PowerBall.
Furthermore, Aaron was offered a 4-6 month plea bargain, which was completely reasonable and he refused it.  The state had a pretty solid case against him, and he was going to be convicted on some counts.  He could have taken the time and been out by now.  He probably could have gotten himself a nice $100,000 a year job easily in some IT department, and going home tonight to fuck his girlfriend or wife.

One more thing.  Turing was arrested for "indecent acts".  Schwartz was arrested for multiple crimes of gaining illegal access to computer systems.  
The critical difference here is that crimes based on sex between two consenting adults have a dubiuos basis in being made criminal.  But Aaron wasn't having sex with another consenting adult.  Aaron was breaking into a computer system and using resources without consent.  Accessing another person's property without consent (neither implied not explicit) should be illegal. 
And I'm just going to stop you right there... It wasn't that he was accessing JSTOR resources, but also because he was accessing MIT resources without authorization.  
[If you haven't read the Volokh's commentary yet]( he agrees the charges were legit.  Lessig also agreed that the criminal charges were pretty much legit.  The question isn't whether he did commit the crimes, the larger question amongst these folks is whether the prosecutor should have pursued it.  I think they should have.  He committed the crime, he knew he committed it, and the prosecutor was going to pursue it to make an example of them.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:25:57
Your argument is flawed because Aaron was arrested not because the information should have been free, but because of the laws he broke while gaining access to the information.  
Look, let's say you know a person is abusing an animal in their apartment, and they have locked their door so you can't get access to that animal.  Breaking into the neighbors apartment, and then breaking down their wall to gain access to the abused pet would still be illegal, regardless of whether it was legal to take the pet away from the owner.
*Aaron Swartz violated the rights of other people in his pursuit of freeing that information.  This is what he was arrested for.*   You just can't go around breaking the law because you have some other end-goal in mind that may or may not be legal.
