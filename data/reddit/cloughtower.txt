But if the nominal value is the only thing rising is the value of their assets really going up?

I think you're missing the point of money. Money isn't worth anything intrinsically, it is a medium to facilitate economic transactions. 
Let's say three farmers: Abe, Bob, and Chris. Each has $1000 in savings. 
In one year Abe can produce either 100 cabbages, 10 potatoes, or 1 carrot. 
Bob can produce either 10 cabbages, 1 potato, or 100 carrots.
Chris can produce either 1 cabbage, 100 potatoes, or 10 carrots.
Assume each wants as many vegetables as he can get in somewhat equal proportion (this is where the math gets tricky and it also depends on how much each one values each vegetable).
Abe chooses not to spend his money and gets 9 potatoes and 10 cabbages.
Bob and Chris use their money to trade with each other and each end up with 2 cabbage, 30 carrots and 30 potatoes. 
Abe, by not trading, ended up with only 19 vegetables. Bob and Chris got 62 each and with better variety.
So tell me, should Abe be rewarded for hoarding is money? Or should the money supply reflect the actual value being added to the economy?
(Edit: the real numbers are .9 of each for Abe and 6 of each for Bob and Chris)

I already addressed this. I also know the formula (the answer is not 6 but it is close).
Abe is being useless
