Aw shit. I haven't seen this picture in a long, long time. Thanks for the nostalgia man
@_date: 2012-05-17 03:05:42
what exactly am I looking at here? a physical bitcoin wallet thing?
@_date: 2012-11-05 15:41:55
we should star it though to show interest in bitcoin, no?
@_date: 2012-03-23 09:58:01
that's what you use? and it saves on their server or something? hmmm...sorry. I'm just sorta new to this. all I have is about 0.16 BTC in my wallet so far given to me from random people from the internet. 
@_date: 2012-11-05 06:40:48
Can....Can I have one?
@_date: 2012-03-23 10:10:08
okay, can I back it up with this usb stick I have with me? how do I do it? 
@_date: 2012-03-23 09:33:34
I got no such email, maybe tomorrow?
@_date: 2013-02-23 09:54:13
Bitpay cups and cakes video?

The day I don't check r/StarCraft....
@_date: 2013-02-14 02:48:29
what app is that in the picture?
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:23:58
oh wow this thread is just full of people misinformed and just ignorant and hateful for no reason. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 10:24:01
Oh wow. This is awesome
@_date: 2013-10-11 07:54:43
well, there is a suggestion section on the steam [here]( maybe if someone makes a thread and a bunch of people ask and suggest it who knows? 
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:43:47
oh god, I wish I had the monies to buy infinite from you!
@_date: 2013-03-01 21:10:20
No I mean throttle bitcoins traffic because you were asking if they can block. Lots of ISPs throttle torrent traffic
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:40:13
I would also like this explained 
@_date: 2013-02-14 05:23:21
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:40:57
I e bitcoins when they were 5 bucks. I regret every single day that I didn't put the 25 I wanted to into it. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:45:20


aw man
@_date: 2013-03-08 12:32:49
You pay your girlfriend?
@_date: 2013-02-14 02:47:21
dominos as in pizza?
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:32:38
I was literally on this site yesterday! I tried buying fez but only realized I was about 0,07 short from it unfortunately. Also, I noticed that it mentioned it not being a steam game? Is it because you are giving it from the humble store or is that just a glitch
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:11:01
true, I dunno. Maybe if we just explain about how it works well or something they won't just mindlessly flame? I dunno  about emailing gabe but he must have like a bunch of emails a day would we be bothering him or something?
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:45:52
I need to remember this next time I'm in Massachusetts
@_date: 2013-02-23 10:51:01
Oh THATS why I couldn't find them. They're not allowed for mobile and I'm on my phone. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:35:28
yeah, you're probably right. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:39:57
They can throttle it to discourage. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 06:41:01
this looks seriously amazing. I want this to be real already
@_date: 2013-02-23 11:20:44
Yeah I think it's just a mistake. I can see all their other videos on my phone. I'll watch it when I'm on my computer later on. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-02-14 10:04:27
Commenting from phone so I can check this out
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:58:45
Also getting a 404 here
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:49:27

@_date: 2013-04-30 07:57:03
yeah is just an awful subreddit
@_date: 2013-02-27 11:10:55
How does this work?
