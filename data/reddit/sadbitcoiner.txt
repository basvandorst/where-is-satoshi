If you have to use an onchain trx to open a channel every time, then why wouldn't they just do an onchain transaction to transfer the money. Christ man, use your head. The channel is supposed to remain open forever, that is the whole point of reducing onchain transactions. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:09:04
Absolutely, virtually any of the alts can be.
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:02:43
Yeah and that is what people said three years ago after Adam said it would take six months only to get discouraged and dump Bitcoin for alts. There are a few reasons why I think that late 2019 is going to be the year of mainstream adoption of lightning.  
1. The routing problem. Even small basic payments are still failing. It is a tough problem to solve. If a node in the middle turns off while it has your money then your money is trapped for a day, there needs to be a solution for that prior to adoption.    
2. Both the sender and recipient have to be online with their own lightning node to send or receive. That isn't a realistic expectation for peer to peer payments.  
3. liquidity requirements to prevent sybil attacks. Right now, the LN graph looks great but it also hasn't been attacked yet. What happens when someone with money \(like Ver\) decides to open up a million channels with each hub and then doesn't send a payment. So there is going to be large liquidity providers however this also requires a lot of trust in the network first. So it will take a lot of time to earn that trust before people put tens of millions into these hubs. Look how slow segwit adoption is. 
None of these problems are backbreaking and will be overcome but it is important to realize that these problems take time and people constantly saying that it is going to be ready in six months for years on end is disheartening for everyone. So yeah, be realistic, this isn't happening any time soon, it will happen but it will take time.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:43:39
Yeah, also even if the technology moves forward, it doesn't mean that Bitcoin will be the winner. It could be replaced by something else entirely. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:51:16
Go back to your ghettoized containment subreddit.
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:19:00
Dude, you are retarded if you think that showing people a purchase that takes over a dollar and 8 to 16 minutes to resolve will convince them that this system is the future.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:53:08
I think the onion routing is the biggest challenge because if a node does down in the route then the payment failed and that money is locked for a day before going back to the sender. This is due to the instructions in the trx only include the last and the next step. So either everything has to be centralized \(I.E. Everyone uses the same two/three mega hubs that never go down so everyone is two hops away from each other\) or we need a new method of rerouting on failed routes. I think we will probably start with the former and then attempt to move to the latter but this is a NP hard problem that isn't really discussed.
As for timeline, I think two years. They haven't even started on watch towers yet, which everyone agrees is going to be mandatory for any non\-face to face transactions. If we are going to rely on a system where everyone is running a node then we need a third layer to watch for nodes when they are offline otherwise any sort of interstate \(let alone international\) transfers are a non\-starter. There is also the risks of someone can broadcast an old state as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:20:21
Bitcoin is a settlement layer for lightning. You telling people to do this is dumb. The spending experience is crap, it is slow, it can take a long time. It is not meant to be used as a currency right now.

You are talking about a space with hundreds of billionaires. If they want to pump the price then they can do it. 
Asking and expecting people to pay to wire money to an exchange, buy bitcoin, pay a dollar or two to move it to a wallet, pay a dollar or two to buy something and then calculate their gain/loss on the sale of property when they could have just used fiat is really really dumb and the only reason why you are suggesting it is because you have this antiquated idea that Bitcoin is a currency when it is not. It is digital gold and you should treat it like gold.

There is a lot of work to go: We lack watch towers for offline transfers, no double sided funding, we need a solution for the exhausted channel hack without using collateral, submarine swaps need to be implemented for reloading channels. 
Which is why I get pissy when people say that lightning will be ready this year for the mainstream, there is no way, so we need to stop giving that impression.

That is fine.   It is hoarding that gives it value.   If everyone tried to spend BTC as soon as they got them, they would have little to no value.   What is the annual turnover for gold? Probably quite low. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:11:08
What is the switching cost to a miner to go between BTC and BCH? Zero, absolutely zero and it can happen instantly. How many BTC are Jihan, Ver, Wright, Ayre, etc holding? It is going to be a lot. If we allow BCH to become legitimized, all they need to do is wait for a difficulty switch and then dump btc for BCH and we are fucked as the chain stops.

The transactions including selling transactions via new channels.
i.e.  You sell BTC for gold via Bitpay then Bitpay sells BTC for cash and gives it to the merchant.  That counts as two transactions, increasing the total number of transactions.

Bitcoin is years away from having a functional payment network. Lightning still needs at least a year or two before it is functional. Even if you could use Bitcoin right now for commerce, it would be retarded. I spent $6k in Bitcoin back in the day, it would be worth over $100k now. I guarantee you that everyone spending that $200k will regret it. Anyone who is pushing the Bitcoin should be used right now instead of just held should be excluded from discussion because they are obviously retarded and incapable of thinking clearly.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:43:55
No it isn't and you are retarded for asserting it is. You are like a child who just found out about Bitcoin. If you spend Bitcoin and then want to replace it then you have to deal with the following. Paying to wire money to an exchange, waiting the week until you can buy, paying the exchange fees, paying to transfer it to your wallet. 
Promoting this shit as superior to pulling out your credit card and getting 2&amp; cash back is retarded, which you are so it fits.

Probably because he read the white paper.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:57:57
Both to be honest. Submarine swaps is probably the easiest but there isn't even a draft spec for double sided funding yet. The toughest is probably the exhausted channel hack, if I transfer you one BTC and the entire channel funds are on your side, then I have no skin in the game anymore and I can try all sort of attacks to try and get some of those funds back. You can publish all the punish trx you want but it isn't going to do anything because I have no funds to punish.
There is two solutions that I have seen discussed. Collateral and network wide punishments. Collateral is basically a non\-starter, you have $100 but you can only spend $80, how do you explain that to a normie? Network wide punishments requires a third layer and there isn't a draft spec that I am aware of covering this topic.

Lol, come on man. Square does almost 17 billion in transactions. Honestly, using Bitcoin for commerce is like taking gold to the grocery store. It is retarded.  
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:04:30
The problem is that you can consider BCH a legitimate competing fork like Vitalik does as it is still sha256 and the same code base without segwit, etc. That gives it a 'bon a fide' that other shitforks like Bitcoin Gold doesn't have because it more closely resembles the working paper. This legitimacy is further enhanced by major infrastructure such as Bitpay and Coinbase adding it. Like a pretender king, there are many who will crown BCH Bitcoin if it reaches the top. 
So maybe you should listen to me when I say that merchants that take BCH should be ostracized and anything that the BCH teams are doing should be ignored. "Oh look Roger said something fucking retarded, let's link his website and put it on our front page", are you fucking retarded? Just ignore it. Don't give them any air otherwise they will have a better shot at the crown and if god forbid they flip, then you will look really fucking retarded for supporting companies like Cheapair that were collaborating with BCH.

Well there are issues in the system as is. The free market doesn't exist and if it did, I think that it would have a greater impact than what we currently see. One thing is for certain and that is creating a dependent class is not the answer.   We have had the "war on poverty" for longer than most people have been born and this has only made the problem worse and even more money is required to fix it.  Regarding what does "productive" mean, this means that providing value however that can be done. Trade is a win-win negotiation, I want your wood carving more than I want my dollar. Being productive just means providing value that you see as being worth the money in exchange. What work? It does not matter, I'm sure that in a future society that there will be many professions that we can't predict just as 20th century farmers couldn't predict the profession of putting spoilers on sports cars.

No one is going to adopt Bitcoin when it costs over a dollar to transfer and that transfer can take up to an hour.

You don't get the existentialist conflict. It is BTC or BCH. There can only be a single SHA256 chain long term, one will eventually snowball and eat the other one due to increasing hash power. Any sort of co\-exist bumper sticker situation will not happen. We either stand together on BTC or that is it, it is all over. It is hard to prevent a company like Coinbase from betraying us but a small retainer? We can heavily punish that entity. We must do that otherwise BCH will continue to gain traction over time.

You are drawing a false dichotomy there. There is a simple way to test your hypothesis.   Over the last hundred years or so, are societies that are more centrally controlled fairer societies? I would argue no, countries that are closer on the free market side are fairer while managed economies do worse the more they are managed. I could provide specific examples but they are all fairly obvious unless you have a counter example that I can address.

I used it for awhile but I got sketched out.   I was talking to the admin and asking why sell khash when it is more profitable to keep it and then you don't need to build this elaborate distribution system.   The reason?   Some altruistic statements about wanting to share mining with the world.   That rubbed me the wrong way and I could not help but think that was completely bullshit.   No one deals with the bullshit of selling and supporting for any reason other than money. Plus they have never posted pictures of their rigs.

I never saw the case for the removal of credit card fees as an incentive for the adoption of Bitcoin.   Given that BitPay or whoever would be charging the retailer for a portion always.   Besides the reason people use credit cards is for the credit and rewards. Neither of which Bitcoin provides. I think we still have a use for mercantile adoption but it isn't credit card fees.

I'm well versed in the topics so you can drop the snide. A free market is just that, you can have your own socialist community, the only reason that someone says socialist market is that they are saying that everyone has to follow that model, which means that the means needs to be seized from the pre existing owners. Which is anti property rights and completely immoral.   Also Proundhon is completely off base when it comes to property, if you have to abstract very basic ideas in order to reach a pre determined conclusion then you really need to reflect on why they are doing that.

I work in the industry, I know what I'm talking about. The job losses are not in accounting students.

Best form of money is a massive overreach given that it blows for in store payments. Even the core development team refer to it as an experiment so there is no harm in acknowledging it.

When you do a transfer, everything goes.

They changed the rules on investment trusts about two years ago that got rid of most of the tax advantages of investment trusts. I'm surprised there are still a few around.   Back in the early 2000's there were a lot of trusts but a lot of them converted back to corporations in the last few years.

Not really. You received bitcoins, you have expenses in usd, you move the bitcoins to an exchange, sell and take the cash. I don't see how that could be more transparent.

Not really. I understand the sentiment but the FDIC guarantees 100&amp; refund of your money, up to 250,000 USD and within a few days. This applies even with bankruptcy. 
Bitcoin is a rare commodity, it is not a replacement for a bank, it will not replace money.

@_date: 2018-04-30 03:17:02
Lol, no man. Banks give credit, this credit is then spent in the economy. If Bitcoin was money, then they will not lend out Bitcoin because a bitcoin today is worthless than a Bitcoin tomorrow. Healthy economies need inflation to prevent hoarding. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:46:21
That is a stretch. There are many different consensus models.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:26:58
POW doesn't give Bitcoin its value. That is just consensus. Having it as a rare commodity is what gives it value.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:54:29
The power of Bitcoin is that it has gone from $0 to $20,000. That is powerful and attracts attention and news media. We should promote the price of a full Bitcoin as much as possible, not to try and convince people that it is affordable or intended as money.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:49:28

That is not true. Many countries, particularly in Asia have zero banking protection. Even in the first world, this amount varies greatly, for example, Canada is only $50,000.
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:56:57
Lol, no one is going to use BTC as money. Deflationary assets make for garbage money because no one spends it, because it is increasing in value. Which is what we want. Hold, don't spend.

Fraud, obviously, but I am willing to throw him in prison under any pretense, I am not particular.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:20:40
Please don't do that. Unless you are a developer, don't use LN yet. It isn't ready yet, we are still years away from LN being mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:45:16
First matters and it doesn't matter then none of them matter because there will always be another project coming up that is great.
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:54:07
You are probably a bcash shill but just in case, think of this. BTC is the first and only digital commodity that is limited in quantity. That is worth a hell of a lot of money and that has zero to do with commerce. Gold is not used in commerce.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:47:05
No, it is like saying that you are protected from bank failures up to an amount that covers off 99.9&amp; of Americans.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:44:15

Yeah, everyone here wants to own worthless property. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:48:27
Problem is that new charities come and go with the founder pocketing cash with little to show for it so there is a strong sense of "it's a scam for money" aura around unestablished charity.   As a result, people naturally will not support a new charity until there is social proof that it is a real charity that is doing meaningful work. So while it is great that you will take bitcoins, don't expect people to send over a ton like sean's outpost.  So I would expect donations for the first few years will be quite poor and the charity funded solely by you. Don't bother with kickstarter or other crowd funding until you have massive social proof like a celebrity on board otherwise people will have their "scam" shields up and you will perform poorly.

Fuck, getting on the Internet was way harder than getting bitcoins, kids have it easy nowadays. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:23:17
Not a fair comparison because you could not buy shares of the internet. A better example would be people who bought shares of the telecom companies that were building the Internet betting that it was going to be a big thing.   I can guarantee there were speculators.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:44:43
Just because bitcoins were worth investing in does mean borrowing money at a incredibly high rate to do so is wise.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:03:37
Because it is not a company, it is a tradable commodity. One analogy people here kick around is that it is digital gold. Therefore it can reach significant highs exceeding that of Apple because there is no expected means of production.   Gold is gold and therefore valuable even though it doesn't make a profit and it is in the trillions not the billions.

I realized that you are talking about microtransactions, the problem right now is that such transactions rely on spur of the moment purchases.

You have to realize that virtually everyone on this subreddit thinks that the altcoins are all scams so asking this is going to irritate people.

This is like the third promo post I seen this morning, no one falls for this shit, just stop.

Awesome, now I can finally not get any work done. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:02:28
How so? It is exactly what I would expect.

No, save your money.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:10:49
I don't see it happening because credit cards give them an option to have the client make impulse purchases, click this and go to the next level, bitcoins would require you to actually make the purchase every time and see the money leave your account. I see credit cards being the most successful in this area.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:52:31
I'm saying that would be a problem for me because I wouldn't know that those drives haven't been compromised.

Man... That is...  I don't know, horrific?  Is horrific a word that can be used to describe that work?  
I bought this painting:
For $400 and you think that your painting is comparable?  Please.  I don't mean to make you feel bad but you should be aware of what your work is worth as an aspiring painter.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:00:49
You should look at the bracelet.  It is so nice and quite flashy.
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:15:58
Also your loss would be offset with a gain for your friend so they would end up paying more taxes.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:59:57
You are right and even if it is a commodity, nothing bad happens, but the majority of the subreddit has decided that it has to be considered a currency to be successful for some reason...
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:10:56
I have mentioned this before but escrow just guarantees delivery, it doesn't provide consumer protection. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:31:34
It is easy and at a great rate. Buying isn't great though. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:07:11

Stuff like that makes me want to pick up my ball and go to Bitcoin markets with the other adults.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:44:56
Escrow just makes it so you receive what you should have received. But what if it stops working the next day or it is a knock off.  Customer protection is much more such as dispute resolution, right of return, timely delivery, etc.  This can only come from regulation such as customer protection acts.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:22:32
Saying that altcoins are a good investment because Bitcoin is going up is like saying that an unknown  tech startup is a good investment because Apple is going up.

Banks are the only companies in the world that can take one dollar of debt and turn it into two dollars of assets.

Currency is a start but bitcoins provide an amazing platform for anyone who wants to build a decentralized application on top of it.

This is the correct technical interpretation and has no impact on Bitcoin.   I don't see why everyone is freaking out and acting like E&amp;Y has something at stake here.

Damn how much?

I would be like issuing more dividend paying shares so it reduces the payout of others so as it grows instead of increasing dividends, they would issue more trills.

Social Proof is a huge phenomenon in our society.  It isn't that an endorsement reassures the consumer, it is that they are lending their credibility and reputation to it.  There has been many cases where this has backfired but it is still better that just throwing a dart blindfolded and seeing what you get.  
Even think of consumer brands, people trust what has been around for a while and are familiar with it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:36:17
Bank branding is so strong, people would put their money there more than property?   Wow.

You are an idiot, look at their website.   They got rid of trading fees a while back and are running it at a loss. They do charge a small fee for a withdrawal to cover the transfer cost.

Given that he has been posting constantly about it for weeks, it is a good indication that this is getting no where. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:17:40
Well his idea was to have the dividend to be a percentage of GDP so when GDP grows, they can issue more if needed. The problem is that they can issue and dilute the current shareholders, which makes it easy to apply haircuts as I mentioned previously. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:14:39
The tax base would be the gifted amount so that difference is negligible.

They are right in that it is a digital commodity, and you don't have a real gain until it is sold.

You would not be able to filter anything on the basis that you can trace any transaction to the original mining. If a reference is 'filtered' that coin would never be use able again.   So I think your post is getting downvoted as it is a non issue.

No but people don't want to barter, they want to be able to pay at the till with a scan. This requires bitcoins, so all they need to do is make it difficult to buy them to begin with.
