L as in the Last sold price.  And bid as in the amount buyers are offering to buy at.  And ask is the amount that sellers are selling at.  The difference between the bid and ask is the spread.  When the bid and ask price match, a sale is made and that price becomes the last price.

Starting to invest early is one of the most important things you can do.  Check with your employer about 401k matching and make sure to max that out.  Also check your 401k default investment (usually they are just bonds or other low risk/reward investments).  Finally, once you get a good amount in crypto, start investing in other traditional investments.  Diversification is your friend.

Perhaps those are legitimate transactions that the miners are "self dealing".  Like if a miner wanted to send a transaction to pay for something, instead of paying a high fee they could pay a low fee and then include it in the next block they process.  That way they don't have to pay a high fee or wait days to get confirmed.

The episode takes place over multiple time periods (present day, 7 years ago, and 4years ago).  Pretty much the episode is the gang trying to remember what they did with bitcoin they mined 7 years ago.  
The bitcoin wallet is used kind of like a MacGuffin.  The best btc joke was when they said btc is today worth $5,000.  I guess that is what happens when you film an episode a month in advance.
They go through an old laptop, but can't find it.  They then remember that it was on another cast members laptop.  They are unable to find it.  They then remember that the laptop was given to their girlfriend who gave it to an ex-boyfriend.  After tracking it down, they find the bitcoin is missing.  Where it is revealed that Sheldon hid it on another cast members keychain USB stick.  Where it is then revealed that the castmember lost the USB stick 4 years ago.

I think for some it could significantly help.  Like exchanges can have a LN between them.  So if someone was sending 1btc to an exchange, and someone else was withdrawing 1btc from the same exchange around the same time, then the LN will let the coin go from the sender to the receiver without going through the exchange on the blockchain.

there is Proof of Stake.  Etherium might implement it at some point.
PoS works by having users sign that the block is correct, and put up a stake (coins) to guarantee it is correct.  This way huge mining farms aren't needed as any basic computer should be able to verify if it is correct.  Also, the people verifying are also the ones who hold the coins, so they have incentive to keep it working properly, unlike currently where miners profit off of congestion.

There is a pure pyramid scheme (or ponzi scheme).  That is marketed as an investment where new members pay out existing members.  It WILL eventually fail because at some point there won't be enough new members to payout existing members (max number is the population of the world).
Bitcoin if different from a pyramid scheme in that bitcoin provides a service (it holds and transfers value).  
For example, Colorado dispensaries aren't able to open bank accounts until marijuana is legal on the federal level.  Because of this, some despensaries sit on millions of dollars in cash.  Everything from paying rent, suppliers, re modelers, and employees have to be paid in cash.  That can be very dangerous for the dispensary.  Bitcoin provides a safe way for dispensaries to hold value, and transfer value (provided other people accept bition).  
The concern that I think your mam has is that many people are speculating on the value of bitcoin.  Which will beg the question, "what happens when the speculators sell?"
Well, the same thing that would happen if speculators sold gold.  The price would crash, until it hits a level that the existing services can support it.  Then it will (perhaps) grow as more business use it.
Right now there are a lot of people who think that bitcoins usefulness will cause it to grow in value as more business recognize how useful it is.  So those people are buying and holding bitcoins until the market recognizes the true value of bitcoin and prices it accordingly.
Or perhaps the market will find bitcoins to be nearly worthless, in which case we will lose our invested money. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:23:24
I think the total amount of bitcoins matters less than the float that is available for sale.  If some large whales started dumping their bitcoin, then the price would go down.
A real life example would be gold.  We don't know how much gold in total is in the world.  If we suddenly found out that some gold reserves where actually empty, then it wouldn't effect the price of gold that much since it still depends on people buying and selling it.
Another example would be the Mt Gox debacle.  Everyone thought that Mt Gox was holding a ton of bitcoin, but it turns out that hackers stole the bitcoin.  Since the wallet is public information, everyone knows to stay away from accepting the stolen bitcoin.  This means that suddenly the spendable bitcoin decreased significantly, which would increase scarcity and price.  But it actually had the opposite effect and crashed the price of bitcoin (mostly because people lost confidence with the security of bitcoin and moved to other options).
You did make me think if there could be a time when the amount of "available" bitcoins would matter.  Some time in the future when everyone is using bitcoins, then the formula we use (total bitcoins divided by total population) might play a huge factor in figuring out the actual price.  But if that happens, then we will be so rich that we probably wouldn't care.

Who pays the fee is irrelevent.  The fact that a credit card payment costs 3% regardless if the merchant pays it or you pay it.  If the merchant pays it, then they just pass the cost onto you buy raising the price.  You don't think the merchant is eating the fees out of their profit?

It's not just the code.  It also has to do with the verification of new blocks.  The miners and nodes may not be able to handle verifying (since it doesn't scale linearly).  This would cause a fork in bitcoin.

Getting your coins off of coinbase as soon as possible is a great idea.  They frequency have "technical difficulties" that prevents sending coins before a split.  
Electrum should be fine to store it on.  Just be careful after the split.  After the split you will need to split your coins (send core to one wallet, send 2x to another).  There will be instructions a week after the fork on how to do that.
I would not try to spend or send coin on Electrum after the fork until you split your coins.  Especially since they can be replayed on the other chain.
Btw, I would suggest a hardware wallet for storing your keys.

The online purchase is showing 0 confirmations?  Or your original transaction?
For an online purchase, I really doubt the vendor will ship the goods before there is a confirmation, which will probably happen in the middle of the night.
For transactions that aren't time sensitive, I would put in a small fee and let it confirm during the night.

The problem would be that the transactions can get replayed.  So if you send from Wallet A to Wallet B, then to Wallet C, ect; on one chain.  Then those transactions can be replayed at a later time on the other chain.  They would have to replay all of your transactions though, but an attacher could get all of your coins into Wallet C and then replay when you actually spend them.
One easy way to split your coins would be to use a low fee.  Since S2X has bigger blocks, it will most likely get confirmed there first.  Once it is confirmed on the 2x chain, you change your transaction on the Core network so that it has a higher fee and is going to a different wallet.  Miners on the Core network will take the new transaction since it has a higher fee.  The miners can't accept both transactions (the low going to the 2x wallet, and the high fee going to the new wallet) so they pick the one with the higher fee.  Once it is confirmed on the Core network as well, you now have your coins in different wallets (one wallet for 2x and one for core).
This new core transaction can't get replayed on 2x because 2x already accepted the old transaction and moved your coins to a different wallet.  And 2x can't get replayed because Core moved your coins to a different address as well.  Just make sure to never move both chains into the same wallet again.

SPV's use the "most accumulated work" to determine the chain to follow.  During the fork, it will be undetermined who that is.  So using an SPV wallet, you won't know if you are on Core or S2X.  And and SPV might flip between the two depending on who has the most work.
Also, there is no reply protection, so if you think you are sending Core coins, it might get replayed and you will end up sending Core and S2X coins.
