Could this be something where they are holding people's funds to play the market a little bit?....say, send you your funds at the rate you requested, yet not release until the btc market shifts.....therefore making them some bitcoin bits?....ie: theft?
Or....does their server just suck?

Seriously....it's not like he's a billionaire or anything.

I'm a BTC noob, but have a legitimate question here.
What does "stuck" mean?  Is it like "pending" with a larger transaction with a box bank?
I love the idea of the bitcoin, but....little slip-ups like this are what's keeping me a little leery.

No, you're right, somebody with a silly social media photo shouldn't be taken seriously.  Don't take into account his investments and success from these, but simply disregard anything he has to say because of a twitter photo.

Right on.  Thanks.

Ok, I am quite new to BTC, but would like some clarification if somebody can provide it.
Are there any steps other than education that can prevent something like this from happening?  OP was simply not fully educated on the best way to store his btc and he ended up losing it all.
In my opinion, one of the dangers still, of these types of electronic currencies.
If I'm reading these types of posts right...some literally take everything from you (Mt. Gox or...some random hacker) and there's literally nothing you can do?
Not knocking the currency, just looking for clarification.
