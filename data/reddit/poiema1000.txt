Hi Pine  ��, 
Hope you went through my comment which I emailed to you regarding screening some African based charities which are worth recommending and are definitely doing what they say they are doing in their communities ... As a social empowerment advocate for the past 8 years in Africa, I have personally witnessed so many so called charities and fraudsters take advantage of the misfortune and desperate state of innocent lives to detour and mismanage funds without providing sustainable solutions to the intended beneficiaries they claim to support.
There is need for thorough screening because informed giving is effective giving. Reason why I will like in my humble person, for you to strongly consider these organizations for the Pineapple Fund, which are putting in the work to create real differences in the lives of their benefactors even with insufficient funds.
Areas include ;
1. Digital philanthropy and education as well as promote learning equality for children in low resource localities 
Website:  
2. Integrated Mental health care, research and society reintegration programs 
Website: 
3. Gender equality, Violence against women and girls(sexual and domestic), School Related Gender Based Violence and child abuse

Hi Pine, 
I am absolutely thrilled to know your extension of love to humanity through the Pineapple Fund is not mainly about Tech.
I came across your recent fund on an article on inverse.com and it proves as an early adopter, you are a fundamental player in introducing a new world all together in charity through the crypto/ Bitcoin space. I was so touched and I still am while writing this very very long message (Sorry Pine :-)
I am particularly overwhelmed as Bitcoin from this part of the world where I come from in Africa is relatively a very very "strange" concept especially for charities here that are attuned to the traditional funding scheme and limited by bottleneck procedures regarding funding their initiatives.   Bitcoin is almost rocket science to most of these charities since it is not mainstream and the Pineapple Fund provides an unprecedented opportunity for charities making a difference from this part of the world to keep making a difference. Pineapple fund is just one of the few ways by which Bitcoin and blockchain is changing the world. 
What baffles me is your simplicity and your values. Its not spectacular, its just supernatural. Your generosity will certainly avert calamity in so many lives,  so many lives!
The setback faced by most existing  charities I've come across which is also a global setback , is that they emphasize more on the problem, rather than developing sustainable and long term solutions to address/solve/eradicate the problem i.e the transition from awareness charities to action-driven charities. Action as they say speaks louder than words!
Dear Pine, my point is your fund will create a greater impact for projects that create direct impact and are solution driven rather than just advocacy and awareness charities as it will be expedient to support action driven charities (this is not to undermine awareness charities at all). 
In Africa and particularly from where I come from, resilience builds up very easily especially due to the abstract IMF adverse conditions relating to access to basic funding sources . I will like to offer up a few insights to consider as to what challenges your funding can do to help local charities not only survive, but thrive:
- Much international aid goes through several levels of intermediaries and sub-contractors; relatively little funding winds up in the hands of the charities themselves, which makes it difficult for them to plan long-term prompting them to work on project-by-project basis to create maximum impact in the shortest while. Of course Pineapple fund defiles the traditional funding rules by accessing  these charities directly without unnecessary intermediaries or administrative bottlenecks. 
- Local charities have a better understanding of what does and does not work in a given community.  They have a more organic relationship with people at the community level and can communicate with them in more meaningful ways. They can launch programs more quickly than large organizations can. Their levels of trust within the community are more deep-rooted than those of international agencies whose personnel are “parachuted in” and wonder why they do not get the same level of receptiveness.
Most initiatives are community based because it is based on a common African philosophy called "UBUNTU"  which means " I am because you are"; thus  changing one life is literally changing a family and that resonates a ripple effect. 
- Indigenous local and national fundraising capabilities are not very developed within Africa so charities are dependent on external funding sources.
Fast forward ;
Your initiative will really make the lives of action driven charity beneficiaries better than they would have imagined and expand their opportunities for a decent human life, transitioning  from victims to victors, from survivors to models of inspiration and dependency to autonomy. 
If you don't mind, I will wholeheartedly do what it takes to adhere to the vision of your generosity by investing my time and skills to screen and recommend such charities in this part of the globe where your fund will do a great good, restore hope and break the dependency cycle in charities from  diverse sectors that indeed make a palpable difference in their communities and creating just and fair conditions for every human life to be valued and upheld. If just one life benefits of your unmatched generosity, I will be forever grateful to have participated in changing a life indirectly.  
Pine, you're an UBUNTU figure par excellence. 
With much respect,
