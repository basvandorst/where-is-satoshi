Coinbase rates are pathetic, its better to use the exchange on which coinbase is based upon. GDAX

I got gox'ed aswell but never lost faith in bitcoins. I lost many bitcoins back then but i got them all for 10 bucks so i didn't bother much or stressed about it. Im a certified holder. I've seen my friends day trade and they hv no life anymore. All they do is to watch the graph all day long. Where as 
I get to study, hangout, game n what not n my profits every month are about the same to theirs. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:26:43
It's not easy or free.  It costs money to run a full node on which all of the bitcoin depends. More nodes equals to what? I'll run 20 nodes if i got paid to validate the transactions just like miners. That's the true way to keep it decentralised. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I bookmarked this thread and will post back in here after 12 months so we all can Lol together. 1000 is no limit. Bitcoin has no limit. After moon. It'll head to Mars
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:47:20
Maybe a conspiracy by big banks to make BTC look extremely volatile and unstable to affect SEC decision in a negative way
@_date: 2017-02-17 18:47:56
I am a noob. Please explain me what a paper wallet is n how to check if i own the private keys? Thankyou all

Any reliable website/blog/twitter/reddit to follow regarding the news/updated about the ETF and its predictions?
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:50:32
But SegWit does not allow it to increase any more than 2mb? Am i right or wrong. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:26:08
Current dip is unnatural. The price should be going up or maintain a high ceiling due to SEC decision speculation. Going down without a break seems odd and unnatural in current situation. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:32:33
And yes a proof of all this happening to you is essential. Im not sure why you'll send money via PayPal when you can easily do it with your bank account. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:52:00
Wtf is wrong with coinbase. 2nd outage in less than 10 days. I'll be pissed if this happened around 11th March
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:39:41
What can we say? The traditional banking system is slow as fuck. You could use Debit or Credit card for instant purchase but they come with a small limit for new accounts. Don't know why. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:48:08
What happens when block size will reach 2mb after SegWit?
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:43:56
Someone reply. I wana get off coinbase asap =(
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:56:18
Anyone? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:28:06
Which other wallet do you use to store btc for long term? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:35:49
Good old days of mining are over (almost). You are couple of years late 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:30:32
Did you dispute the transaction? You realise there's a support team on local bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:33:29
I pay for with bitcoin wherever it is available. That's my preferred payment method. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:37:44
Hey guys can this still happen even if i pay the highest fee for my transaction? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:45:01
Anyone? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:34:49
No it does not. All the past dips are natural and result of various news/actions from people's bank of china and etc. Nothing in the universe just 'happens' without a reason.
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:37:26
Unfortunately, there is none available to buy bitcoins directly with PayPal 
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:04:09
It only allows you to buy Amazon items, though not directly but via person who is looking to buy bitcoins and have a valid Amazon gift card, they'll pay for your purchase with their gift card and you'll pay them in bitcoins

Coinbase is working fine 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:22:41
The activity of Selling the coins that is
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:23:39
That's a flaw in bitcoin, this issue will cause it to become centrilised in near future. Currently there's no awareness to fix this illogical error. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:59:52
Why not one ever suggests BitPay?! Its so good! 
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:27:13
After a while your limits will be removed from coinbase 
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:55:02
BTC ecosystem still can't seem to get around this bottle neck after 8 years of it inception. This tells alot about the future of bitcoin. People have to go through leaps and bounds just to purchase. That's simply unreasonable and a much grave issue than the blocksize. Every passing year the options to easily purchase bitcoins seem to get less instead of increasing. And this is the case in USA. Rest of the world dsnt even count. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:06
GDAX working fine
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:14:11
BitPay is the best

Your predictions are as good as anyone else's. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:20:50
They don't run the bitcoin. Utter nonsense only expected from a BU supporter. That's why we know all of you are liars ahs dishonest people who can twist reality to support your version.  
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:32:04
It'll drop as much as the sudden recent rise which took it up from 1000 to 1300 so around 300 or so
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:34:39
LOL! Thats entirely true. Though, quite scary aswell, such an attitude could easily be the demise of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:17:21
I think Winkle bros already know the decision by now and selling n everyone is following suit
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:57:37
All the SEC related market correction has happened
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:40:51
Nobody has time to kiss everyone's butt. Division is a good thing if that's a way forward to get rid of bad greedy eggs who are holding btc back. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:39:15
So you think the dip is over in less than 1 hour and we are already heading back to the moon? I thought markets were far more complex and tricky then this!
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:17:58
What's the value of your transaction if you don't mind sharing?

Summery please? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:36:04
That's the price for decentralisation and I'm happy to pay it. For rest of the cheap asses, they can go back to PayPal or using Credit Card
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:20:32
Open your eyes. It's a 150$ drop by now and steadily going down
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:03:47
I stand corrected. It was not Winkle but 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:33:46
What exchanges crashed? Stop spreading wrong info, every exchange is working just FINE 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:07:39
Can i send bitcoins with my credit or debit card? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:19:33
By the looks of it, its already stabilized and increasing again after the great crash of 2017
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:48:45
They won't have any blue balls, no reason because are still in profit and still millionaires, they just couldn't become billionaires this year, but hopefully soon.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:26:14
Everyone talking abt SegWit and all that fail to realize this is the main reason which is holding bitcoin back from going mainstream. You just cant easily buy coins with your legitimate money and no one will bother to fix this. Circle ran away for some unknown reason.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:53:42
Ohhhh really? What time is in China right now?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:33:00
What he said doesn't even qualifies as bullcrap.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:54:13
Yes exactly. It's the middle of the freaking day in China

What drug cartels used before Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:25:46
That's the current price. The lowest it went down to was 1160$. That's close to 150$. The general trend is sell. Besides, I did not say they were selling 100% of their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:29:31
No the problem is with the Bitcoin eco-system which don't give a shit about new users rather only concerned about their own holdings. Why is it hard for someone to setup another system like Circle pay? Why there has been no new coinbase alternative in like forever? The future is P2P fintech. If bitcoin will not take lead in that, its bound to stay stagnant except for a few price gains here and there.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:15:41

That's too slow Kim. It should be 200$ billion by 2018. Pfft.

Coinbase is the most unreliable bitcoin exchange/access point. We cant wait for a better alternative
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:46:39
I second that!
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:59:11
I posted it before and posting again. This is why 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:56:21
Don't make lame assumptions. I bought my bitcoins when this sub didn't even exist. In 2011.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:52:22
Can we buy and sell with it?
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:48:57
Over rated news. People have simply moved to local bitcoins. These exchanges can put the withdrawal ban forever for all i care. Will not change anything 
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:29:27
That's exactly what it is
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:36:41
The hidden value in BTC is from the people like me and you, who have trust and faith in it and a hope that an EMP attack won't wipe out our wallets and servers.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:50:14
Coinbase has been pissing me off 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:22:12
He really needs to change his display pic
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:16:36
That's not true. Miners aren't retarded. They know choking the network will only hurt them in long run when people will quit using BTC in favour of other coins which don't hv these issues. The future is of crypto currency, and it's here to stay but same can't be said for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:44:36
How do you know that? All exchanges are working fine. Coinbase is NOT an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:27:29
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:33:07
Where did you read that anyway. Looks one wrong info. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:27:14
The basis is weed. Got it. I was asking about your prophecy specifically bout 2018.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:08:25
The guy who posted above must be one of the scammers running that blog and all. I 'invested' 50$ worth of bitcoins couple years back in one of those sites. The site got shut down after 2 days. All those reviews and everything related to this stuff is 100% fake and made up. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:01:18
It happens with block halving. Not difficulty increase. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:26:06
By core i meant core developers

You wouldn't hv asked that question if you had ever bothered looking at gold prices from 2008 to 2012. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:51:32
Can someone else please confirm and reply. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:58:38
Mate, wtf? Just get a new one if you got atleast 1 full BTC. Unless you are thinking you might get lucky like the other guy.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:31:44
It did not say the word write down your seed when asking me to do it. it just said backup your wallet and keep these phrase safe. So im just confused. Anyone else can help
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:27:27
Dear lil sir. I don't think 2$ is a huge fee for decentralisation. I'll happily pay 5$ to stay decentralised. Besides, after SegWit it'll be resolved sooner or later but I have no problem with it right now. Also the recent spike in fee's is due to BCH and greedy immoral miners who are switching network back n forth for temporary profits. Only proves that miners can't be trusted at any level. They'll sell their souls for temporary profits if they had to. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:08:42
Which Ledger? It shows there are two of those
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:30:25
Can you post a step by step guide? Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:46:49
That's idiotic. During financial crisis. Assets lose their value drastically. There's a ton of money that will flow into bitcoin to protect devaluation of assets like it already has  been in a small scale. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:26:54
I think it was the 12 word seed that it made me write down. Can you confirm?
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:37:04
Scam? How? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:06:43
We are talking about 'financial crisi'. Big players are all that matters during those specific times. You are just now all vague and assuming things left and right to suit your fixated idea. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:17:51
Sure does
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:18:10
What do you mean by that
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:13:02
What happens if my wallet dies? How can i recover my coins? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:54:14
Seems your brain couldn't read the rest of my reply. BCH dishonest troll 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:00:00
Thanks for reply. I wana be able to hold my own private keys so coinbase isn't an option. Any wallet you'll suggest with a good interface 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:55:54
Because you think only average people with no spare assets are the ones that will buy. That's a false assumption. No one cares about them. We talk about big investors who are always looking to use their money even during a financial crisis. You need to know more about what happened during 2008 crisis to even understand all this. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:57:19
Group of losers who lost money with 2X futures are trying to scam people. Stay away.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:59:18
You are simply delusional and beyond repair at this point &gt; 
I guess you lost everything in 2X future along with your sanity.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:39:23
Your idea of thriving btc economy is also flawed just like your first question. People buying/not buying btc is according to their disposable income not because of non existent currency conversion limits.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:46:07
So that's how they've been adding 800,000 users per week.
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:33:04
People have exactly 2.5 years to buy as much BTC as they can. 2020 is when the real fun starts! 
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:51:48
Like the other users have stated. The great halving of 2020!
@_date: 2017-09-22 03:30:51
Just a shit post to promote the website.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:16:54
Your question is flawed. One can buy any amount of btc with their own local currency via local bitcoins. Also, almost every country has their own local exchanges and other btc buying service providers from which you can buy btc through local currency. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:29:26
Pay more attention to the picture. Or brainstorm with 10 other friends looking at the picture

Mining companies? When you read that somewhere - RUN AWAY. Bunch of freaking scamsc trying to rob bitcoin noobs. There's no such thing as cloud mining or mining company. Each and every one of them are 100% fake and scam. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:47:58
It certainly does not
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:45:27
Only one simple fact that people are becoming aware of it and it's becoming more accessible to buy bitcoins everyday. I've been floating my idea that if there were more easy ways to buy bitcoins the price will rise dramatically. It's still very hard for an average person around to world to buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:42:01
Is BitPay just as safe after they recently made an announcement regarding the upcoming hard fork?
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:43:49
What wallet? I think the fee wasn't that low. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:23:39
Are my coins safe on Bitpay? If not. Where to move them? This shit is fking bullshit n confusing.
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:53:30
Any other alternate wallets that i can use just to be extra safe where i hold my private keys? I hear Bitpay belongs to the other group!
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:53:53
Thanks alot for this! BitPay/CoPay is the best
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:38:32
Please tell me how to export my private keys and to where? I have the phrase written down safely. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:26:11
I wana know the same! Bitpay and CoPay. Both same n safe?
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:41:20
They have already started by funding anti btc articles on famous mainstream media.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:07:27
Open your eyes and mind. It is mainstream since past few years pfft. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:29:07
If you are buying 4$ worth of BTC. You are just doing it so you get the excuse to troll and bitch about BTC. Who the hell would want to buy 4 dollars worth of bitcoin and for what? Utter bullshit i say.
