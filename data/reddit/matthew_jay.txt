Great comment here, thanks for sharing! Yes I would say I was greedy in a way and risked more than I should. I was 26 at the time and looking to keep making it big. Risk is absolutely my main concern now but I will still shoot for the stars! 
Thanks so much altspaceman! 
p.s Are you a trader?

Will do. Thanks for the advice.

That is such a great point! We need principals to follow for sure. This is what has helped me so much. No matter what happens or how you are feeling, you follow your rules/principals/values. That is what will keep you in the game for the long haul and keep you sane when things are tough by knowing your plan.
You made such great points here. Watching the Arnold video now, thanks :)
I want to read his book soon. Heard it is great.

A couple years ago I went through a few big financial difficulties. Took some big losses and then I got stuck in life. Thinking of the past and not moving forward... This can easily happen to any of us, so I thought I would share some tips/experiences on this subject. Such as.....
Not becoming a victim
Living in the moment
Meeting people
Learning valuable lessons
Making it back
