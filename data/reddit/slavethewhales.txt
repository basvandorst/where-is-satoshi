This is very cool. Would you mind if I steal this image to use?
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:36:51
That's a bummer, I hope they get back up soon
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:25:00
Its only like $0.30, but it's all I have left in my hot wallet. Happy 4th!
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:14:39
Ha I doubt I could get much by Tindering myself out. I'm already loaned out too I'm afraid. Just trying to motivate myself to get back in as soon as I can really. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:18:47
Try blockchain.info
Make an account, then add your wallet address. It will notify you every time you send or receive. It will be in read-only mode unless you import the private key, which is plenty for quick management purposes.
@_date: 2014-04-18 05:47:32
I'm not really sure actually...
@_date: 2014-04-18 05:46:32
Nice. I saw an engraved wooden one somewhere that looked pretty cool, but I can't remember where I saw it
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:35:58
I think Bitcoin should sponsor a car too. I mean, The Bitmobile?! The marketing alone...
@_date: 2014-04-18 05:48:04
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:57:25
You are 100% correct. I got these by buying and mining little by little while I could. I actually just moved to a new state to start a new job after being under employed for quite some time, and I have been out of work for about 3 weeks during the transition. I already sold my DSLR and other items worth selling and this was the last thing I ever wanted to do. Trust me, my lone bitcoin was my prized possession! But you know, the wife and kid and all that.
The good news is that work starts this week and I'll be able to save money again, so I won't be out for long hopefully!
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:00:33
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:47:51
Myself, I want to keep a majority of my coins here, probably about 75%
I don't intend on selling much if any of my crypto anytime soon. The rest I will keep in hot storage on my computer for any purchases or trading I need to make. I think we are still years away until cryptocurrency is truly mainstream and implemented in a way that the everyday user can easily use them, so these should suit me well until that time.
@_date: 2014-04-19 04:09:22
Yep, that is the site I was thinking of.
That sounds like a really cool plan. If you do make something like that, you should definitely post it for everyone to drool over
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:49:23
Since the other guy got a reply, why not? What's your add?
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:49:30
I only have 0.08 now myself. You can have my extra satoshi's if you want. Maybe they'll be worth a ton someday!
@_date: 2014-05-22 06:18:20
Yes, that would be cool!
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:59:40
Done, and resume submitted. Hope to hear from you guys!
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:18:57
Thank you! Just hope you don't get too addicted, have it ruin your life, and want your tip back!
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:59:02
Don't remind me :/
I have $27 in the bank and already sold my good stuff. At least I start work this week after relocating. I'll be back on board soon!
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:18:47
I understand, and I'm not asking anyone here for any Bitcoin. It's for my serving job and I just want to let any customer know they can tip me in BTC if they're so inclined. I thought it would be a cool idea for any others in my position to think about trying. Good looking out though.
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:35:27
@_date: 2015-09-08 21:47:04
That's for sure. It's fascinating to learn how it all really works
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:39:49
Same here, works perfectly. Wish I didn't have to wait a week for my 0.02 BTC to be available, but no big deal. I wait until it reaches 0.1 then withdrawal to my own wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:02:57
Wow, that is crazy. Even crazier that people sent that many coins to it!
@_date: 2015-09-08 21:09:34
I didn't even know it was possible to have less than 34 characters until very recently. It looks like R-Z or a-z as the letter after the first 1 are most of the only ones with 33 or less, unless I am mistaken. I wonder if there is a mathematical way to figure out which letter (after the 1) is truly least likely to appear.
Looking now I do have an an address that starts with 1v and it is indeed 33 characters long, I just never bothered to count it before. Apparently addresses can be as few as 27 characters long but I've never seen or had one myself, or how that even works...although it would be pretty cool.
I don't really understand exactly how, but at least I have something new to geek out on!
@_date: 2015-09-09 11:59:06
I'm still wrapping my head around the process, but that does make sense. Thank you for the example
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:20:46
Somebody ordered a pizza
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:33:20
Sweet! I'm SO doing this!
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:00:17
I sure hope so. Tonight's shift just ended and nobody even brought it up, so hopefully I'll at least get some people asking about it. I'll have to update when/if I get my first tip. I love the idea. I'm not really a fan of tips being taxed, so if there would be a way to start more service industry people to get involved it would be a win/win
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:30:39
I'm thinking once a month maybe? I'll keep track in case anyone cares to know how it turns out.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:27:47
Thanks for keeping me in mind, I appreciate it. Good luck with your current engy, hopefully sooner than later it will be widely accepted 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:48:11
My god, you're right. Such shame...
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:34:32
If you're ever by SDSU stop in (around dinner time)
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:44:11
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:46:54
No tip sharing at all. I give the bussers some for cleaning my tables, that's it. You have to declare a certain percentage based on sales, but that's it. I suppose I could factor in a BTC tip in there if I felt so inclined.
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:00:51
70th st!
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:52:28
Apple pulled it :/
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:59:13
I am currently working on a before/after preview section of the website. Here is a project I just did the mastering for very recently:
If you would like to hear your own song, you can always upload it to the website and I will send you a sample clip for free.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:45:17
You. I like you.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:27:11
Sounds great! Remember you will get a 1 minute preview sample, so you can make sure you're going to like what you hear before you spend any coin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:43:33
That's a good idea, I think I'll do that
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:59:24
I honestly wouldn't change anything. I'd report it the same as cash because that's how I see it. I feel Bitcoin is on the cusp of being mainstream and people need to use it legitimately.
Not to say that I think tips should be reported and taxed in the first place, but that's just the way it is for now.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:48:57
Paper and tape :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:25:44
Better than I, my friend
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:24:40
I'm in San Diego, and we have a lot of tech here. Here's hoping!
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:56:23
I think that would be an amazing best-case scenario! I would be prepared to make a presentation to corporate about this if it ever came to that. Honestly, Denny's isn't making as much as they would like I believe, and the publicity that would give them would definitely be most welcome. If I could help create the catalyst that breaks Bitcoin into the mainstream, I would be honored! I only have about $20 worth now, so helping it grow would definitely help me too.
(Edit: fixed autocorrect nonsense)
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:46:30
It's already accounted for and shows up in the w2
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:53:31
Thanks! I'm in San Diego, CA
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:01:08
I can still use the blockchain.info app. If that ever stops working I still at least have a picture of my QR saved. Always liked my iPhone, but their lack of BTC support is seriously making me lean android next time around.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:35:13
Also saving up for an upcoming wedding, so figured any little bit helps.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:49:56
I like it. Sounds like a good idea on getting the word out.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:01:55
Agreed. I will redo it soon and integrate it with the logo
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:35:29
I was thinking about sticking it on the back of the name tag so I flip it over in case anyone wanted to scan it. That, or pull my phone out. If nothing else, it could be a good conversation starter.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:49:15
Well in that case...
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:48:33
"Welcome to Chotski's!"
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:53:41
Might as well!
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:03:20
Yeah, I thought about that. I was afraid people would mistake it for a work thing though. If it ends up working, I can just pull out my phone and let them scan my code from there.
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:34:26
I think I want a small sticker that has the QR code with a small Bitcoin logo so people know what it's for
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:50:43
I give the bussers some money for helping keep my tables clean, but I just give them cash. One day hopefully everyone will have BTC wallets and I can just give them some coin at the end of the night.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:45:03
They're pretty popular, but definitely make sure you tell them to hold the mayo. That shit is gross.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:46:46
For those so inclined:
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:43:55
Reading my mind :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:02:56
Mark of the bit!
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:53:45
If you have iOS (like I do) use this:
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:08:18
It's in San Diego, the 70th street location by SDSU. Maybe try finding a small button to put on your shirt. I bet that would serve the same purpose.
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:54:55
Lol I hear ya. The Xmas presents I wrapped were a joke.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:48:27
Fair enough. I will definitely print up a batch and keep them in my book.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:04:43
Yeah I'm pretty familiar with android. I just upgraded, so hopefully before my contract is up they'll have more options. Not holding my breath though.
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:31:44
Ahh, well I guess that solves that. I thought I heard that from a couple different places. Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:32:33
Try it out and see how it goes. Post when you get a tip!
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:30:42
Ha, thought as much!
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:32:13
Thank you! Merry Xmas!
