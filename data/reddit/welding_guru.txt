This is PhD level trolling.

I have a couple coworkers who daytrade crypto and I've been trying to teach them how it really works. The one dude thought bitcoin mining was Minecraft.
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:37:57
They definitely were at first, I was nervous as hell for a while.

This happened to the place I work at 2 years ago, but it was way more than $800, and we're a big company. We had backups and they framed it as a "system upgrade" to everyone. They actually did upgrade our network but I saw the ransom note, it asked for bitcoin payment. 
I found out about it because it was pretty well known around the office that I traded bitcoin. This was when bitcoin was around $1000 a piece so people would ask me about it every now and then. 
One day the upper managers called me in and handed me the printed ransom note, and asked me what it was. It was a demaning 10 bitcoin (~$10,000 at the time) be sent within a certain number of days, I wanna say 5, or they would destroy all of our files. It had the bitcoin address and even a scannable QR code. I told them it looked like a spam e-mail and I would disregard it. Then they told me the reason the server was down that day was because it was encrypted by some hackers and we didn't have access. 
Like I said though, we just upgraded everything and went on business as usual.

That's called a bank account. We have those already.

I bought and sold thousands of btc at $.11 a piece
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:48:43


The majority of people who are on the fence about using bitcoin, yes.
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:48:56
Tha'ts pretty optimistic. If you found a place where you could double spend $5, you could make a bot that double spends $4.50, then run it a million times.

I sold at $1300 in 2013 for a down payment on a house. If I would have waited until 2018, I could have bought my house outright with like $500k left over. Instead I have like 300k and 25 years left on a mortgage.
But I also recognize how cool it was for a $26 "investment" to turn into enough money for a down payment on a house.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:53:39
ugh.... can confirm.... I sold at $1000 in 2013 for a down payment on a house. If I would have waited until 2018, I could have bought my house outright with like $500k left over. Instead I have like 300k and 25 years left on a mortgage.
Invest wisely, kids.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:08:02
I did, I had to explain it all to my bank too because they look at all your deposits when you get a mortgage and all my money came in at one time seemingly from no where.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:08:18
Yea I recognize that for sure, I spent like $26 and it turned into $40k. Its just my story for new bitcoiners.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:49:18
I had to go back through the price history to actually remember and remembered a bunch of other little details too. 
December 2011. I was on winter break from college at my parent's house and I was going to buy something off the Silk Road. Dark net markets were like brand new back then so I went up to the point of buying some bitcoin to do a test buy and see if it was legit but I bitched out when it came to actually shipping anything to my parent's house. I lived in a frat house in college and we were already on double-secret probation so I wasn't about to ship it there either. Ended up sitting on the coins because cashing them out was a pain in the ass at the time.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:23:56
This is actually a banger too lol
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:11:58
lmao sorry dude! 
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:46:28
You can pay the IRS in cash. You need to cash out your bitcoin in order to be taxed on it. I see no problem here.
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:34:33
1.You should pay taxes if you owe them.
2.The capital gains tax tops out at 28% in the US- thats for short term stocks when you made over $190,000 that year. It tops out at 20% for long term (more than 1 year) investments. If you're single, head of household, and make less than $50k then there is no capital gains tax. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:50:44
lmao what? I bought in 2012, still sitting. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:12:29
I see that. I feel like the old man around here "you damn kids need to get off my blockchain!"
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:18:33
Nobody said anything about being anonymous.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:41:00
Its still up 35,000% over the last 5 years though.... which is about 34,980% better than any of my other investments...
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:30:51
Man that sucks. I would either keep a real close eye on whatever they're doing or I would act like I don't really care what's on the hard drive. I'd probably go with the 'acting like I don't care' route because I assume any nefarious professional programmer would be able to copy all of your data without you knowing. 
Either way I'd get it back and move those coins to a secure location immediately because if you have a password that's crackable, it could still take some time to brute-force.

Its new within the last couple of years. I haven't been on this sub since like 2016 and it was just 'hold' back then
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:17:51


Yep total speculator. 
In all seriousness, I never bought btc to try to make money. I bought it to buy stuff off the Silk Road, then I bitched out on buying that stuff. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:43:24
ahhh, that's what it is. I hadn't picked up that. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:11:02
Username checks out.
Seriously though, that's why I got into btc... the reason I ended up hodling is because I bitched out on actually buying anything off the silk road. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:57:53
I was looking at prices last week thinking I was going to buy some, glad I got lazy.... I checked again today and then came over to this sub to see what's up. It's same old bullshit so I guess its time to go back to the MOOOOON!!
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:42:07
So what you're saying is... hodl?
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:57:07
you give me hope, nursing guy. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:13:13
relevant username?

600+ comments and this is my favorite one.

Nice retort. I'll consider this when evaluating how usable a coin is.
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:59:22
Careful, that kind of talk is blasphemous around these parts. Head over to r/btc if you want a usable coin.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:28:53
so when the police have auctions that feature mob boss's houses, cars, and furniture, is that money laundering? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:45:48
This circular nature is strangely reminiscent of how fiat currency acquires value.
A dollar has value because I can buy something useful using it, and the recipient accepts it because he can trade it to someone who can trade it...
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:42:48
How does that "show my snarkiness is uncalled for" ?? - all you're saying is that fiat is valued and traded by more people than BTC and that those people have guns. Fiat is backed by nothing but the idea that it's worth something, no different than a digital currency except nobody can print BTC more at will. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:18:13
BTC isn't the source of funding though, it's a mode of transfering funding. USD isn't on the list because they're not printing money, they're selling oil and shit for money. Which is why BTC and USD should not be on this list. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:48:06
He wants to pay the president $4million a year. 


He also volunteered to start the $4million a year after he's out of office but still would be held to the same standard as if he got the $4million a year.
This dude is the opposite of corruption.

Yea I can pay mine off early if I had the money to do it. I know I made out like a bandit with my ~100x returns on $130 but I still cringe when I think about how I could have waited to buy a house and paid cash.

tell that to everyone who got into it before it was worth anything. Its a decentralized currency - that right there is why I'm in it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:16:58
If I would have kept my btc in 2013 instead of putting a downpayment on a house, I could have bought the house outright in 2017. Instead I'm locked into a mortgage for 25 more years. Just something to think about, no pressure.
@_date: 2019-05-18 04:14:06
This is true, I did get into it at the beginning for the lulz. I stayed because I believe decentralized currency is the future.
