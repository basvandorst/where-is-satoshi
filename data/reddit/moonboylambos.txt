I said it, if hacker stole my mpk does it matter? because I want to use mpk on my everyday use PC. Right now I store my keys offline.

I bought at 6k just because I calculated the % wrong from 2015, I was waiting for the same % drop as in 2015, I would've had 2x more coins now.

Most of us back then were in btc-e trollbox, not reddit, I didn't even know of reddit existence 3 years ago.

People tend compare crypto to email evolution, I think Ethereum probably falls perfectly into this category, it was bound to happen we will have countless garbage tokens, all we need to have is some spam filter.

I have an old wallet.dat from 2013 from Bitcoin Core, can I use my old adress on a mobile app or a different type of wallet or wallet.dat doesn't support seed migration?

I've been altcoiner since 2013 but for the first time I bought a bit of Bitcoin for hold 2 days ago before the pump, observing the history of many fallen coins with broken promises I started doubting in some of my hodlings but I still believe some will have a worldwide use, question is which ones.

I only check this sub briefly and he's everywhere bashing bcash, some people got few screw lose because of crypto it seems, I guess a lot of money on the stake does it to you.

My Windows Defender said it's a trojan too, yes it was necessary because I didn't find definite answer on Google.

I was looking at reddit as an indicator, I just noticed the activity in daily thread on r/cryptocurrency plummeted after another Bart forming up, based on that I guess we will still be this year in the shitter. If not then it's good anyway because I bought enough "dips" arleady.

As I read in this topic I can generate the seed just like in modern altcoins by dumping via command but that guy says to send the coins to new wallet but he didn't use any arguments, that means an old wallet won't work properly on a modern app wallet or any other non-bitcoin core desktop wallets?

I know few purposes that are great for like using it in collapsing countries, buying illegal stuff and money laundering. Question is if another use cases will take off.
@_date: 2019-02-11 11:52:36
Dunno about that, I was thinking that people are retarded when they were buying when it crashed to $10k now it's a pretty nice deal but still I wouldn't go all in until we'll see a total desert in social media then it will be time to buy, might not happen but it's always wise to have spare cash.

I had an alert saying it's a "LudicrouzV" trojan, so far nobody hijacked my coins but would be nice if someone can confirm it's just false positive.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:34:44
I bought partially every dip, this way I don't have to give a shit about predicting the future.

It was way oversold arleady because of all the trash ICO's exit scamming, add the Constantinople hype and it's no brainer that it pumped that high, the pump was overdue.

Is master public key safe to share? I mean, if I want to create watch wallet do I need to care if hacker would steal my mpk?
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:54:59
Is it safe to set the lowest fee possible if I'm not in a hurry? how long transaction like this can get stuck using bc1 adress?
@_date: 2019-02-11 11:58:14
It's only good to maybe buy a portion, the media is still pretty active about crypto.
