Definitely not the other way around. I saw one meme on the front page, while the rest is filled with highly informative material.
Remember, this isn't me advocating for more memes, this is me advocating for just memes in general. If the memes get downvoted, then whatever, but for a few of us they're pretty decent coping mechanisms.

It more than likely won't happen, unless a large portion of bitcoin users decide that the selling price is high enough for them to cash out all at once.
About to pay off first semester, I'll end up buying fractions to get my feet wet.

The only reason I want bitcoin to crash is so that I can buy bitcoin.

Broke college student that's looking to take a chance. No risk, no reward, right?
I think $30 wouldn't be too dangerous.

I'm a beginner myself, but if there's two things this subreddit has taught me:
1. It's never too late to invest in Bitcoin. The best time is now.
2. If you're investing, be prepared to hold onto it for a while, good or bad.

My bad, man. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not adept at telling jokes from serious statements. Holds true in real life, as well.
My apologies.

Not trying to be "that guy", but these are the kind of comments that hinder the growth of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:41:49
Now that I know this is a joke, let's entertain the thought that he was serious:
It would just seem to me that this "let's buy drugs off of silk road with BTC" mentality would lead to sweeping government legislation that would impose hindering regulations and create some stupid central authority that would drastically devalue BTC.
Not that I don't support the notion of truly free alternative currency and truly free markets and doing whatever you want with your money/currency, it's just that the government in it's current state would probably sh*t all over BTC if these kind of comments became the common BTC community consensus.

Kind of a hybrid. Definitely want to put my money to work. I know I can't pay for college with it, but even if it gets to the point where I can start paying chunks of tuition, that'd be great.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:31:15
Definitely the right move.

Coinbase is working fine for me so far.
My bank is just a group of dicks.

...Here I am feeling like an ass again.

I definitely will. Gave a buddy of mine a fractional amount to kickstart his investing. We're aspiring venture capitalists (we acknowledge BTC is anything but startup, however) and we just wanted to see how our first big investment would blow over.
We made a pretty safe investment thanks to 's advice!

Mighty generous!
[I'd tip, but I have very little coin. I am tipping in spirit!]

All Windows Phone users have are very shoddy MtGox apps that let you compare prices but not actually trade your bitcoins in for USD.
Not that I'm trading to USD any time soon, but, I mean, if I'm in a pinch and I really need to sell off some of my BTC, I'd like to be able to relatively quickly.
Poor windows phone :c
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:30:48
Alternatively, you could just buy some.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:16:16
This guy was like my investing hero :c
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:33:00
Fuck, I guess that means I get to sell off so I don't have my fucking bank account closed.
Thanks for the ride guys!
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:59:21
Wow, thanks!
I just see no reason in being mean spirited on the internet, even if you wind up being wrong (suffice to say I have lost my temper once or twice on the internet, but if I can help it, better to just laugh at yourself).
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:49:32
Coinbase is extremely user friendly and the best for getting your feet wet.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:21:31
I agree. The holding mentality is really hindering the market.
