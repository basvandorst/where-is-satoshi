Maybe hes saving it for a moment much lile the easter egg hunt in the movie Ready  Player One? Scattering Cryptographic puzzles all over the earth with the "easter egg" being the private key to that wallet. 
Think about it, Satoshi reveals himself to the whole world after bitcoin is mainstream as hell and the price is oodles and oodles expensive. 
"Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am THE Satoshi Nakamoto. How do you know its me? (camera moves to his computer to reaveal 1 million btc. Everyone go bonkers) I have watched the world grow fond of my beautiful creation. I am revealing myself to tell you all that one of you has the chance at being the wealthiest human being alive, ever. I have hidden clues around the globe. With the right set of skills, determination and patience, the keys to my kingdom will be yours...or you may share those keys with your fellow man and enrich the lives of everyone, the choice is yours. The first clue is located here ( points to a small town in Turkmenistan and gives a cryptographic riddle) Once you have completed the challenge, i will personally reward you. May your diligence turn into success. Let the journey humble you...oh and have fun!"

Ive read your post aswell as some comments. I havr to say none of what your saying is currebtly based on any fact. If you could provide a shred of evidence instead of allegories, confirmation biases and nonsense. I believe in a very very very very finite amount of conspiracies, but only ones where the evidence objectively suggests them. Banking, and a few other VERY tinfoil hat ones. Besides the point.
I read a commeny tjat had to do with a very mundane, yet very plausible reason for the selling, and i agree with it. It is worth mentioning however a healthy amount of skepticism is a good thing and should be noted that misdeeds can be done under the guise of good conduct, but until something can be uncovered, there isnt a reason to frett.

I use green dot too! Unfortunately I dont know of any exchanges that accept Green Dot. I'll tell you how I get my coin. You pay a tad more for fees in the long wrong, but its the only way i know how to get coin with a Green Dot "bank" account.
TEN RELATIVELY EASY STEPS 
1-Create a PayPal account
2-Verify your account by linking you Green Dot bank account to Paypal.
3-Go to Virwox.com and create an account.
4-where it says "Deposit" on the lower left hand side, click that.
5-There will be an option to use PayPal express to the left of that Icon will be a box where you put in the dollar ampunt you wpuld like to deposit.
6-After depositing, look on the lower left hand side again(below the options for withdrawal and deposit) here will be an option labled "USD/SLL" click/tap this to convert you USD to SLL
7-In the same area as listed in step six, therd will be an option called "SLL/BTC". Click/tap this to convert your SLL to BTC.
8-Go to withdrawal, get your deposit address from your desired exchange or wallet service and input that letter and number combination in to the "Address" box of the Virwox site and proceed to click/tap the Withdrawal  (or submit button, cant remember exactly right now)
9-Wait the obligatory time required by new users. This maybe a day or two, after using Virwox a couple of times the waiting time will only be less than 1 1/2 hours
10- HODL

You can use VirWox.com
Deposit funds after creating account
Convert your fiat to SLL
Than convert your SLL to BTC
Withdrawal to your wallet/exchange.
You suffer a little more in fees, but you have practilly zero % chance of being scammed.
I regularly use it as i do not own a bank account.

Thank you, this answer really cleared up my confusion. When i saw this  my first thought was "is this a "signal" for things to come?". 
So let me make sure i understand this from what you said. Its because they are trading higher volumes at once, and that it isnt some kind of of buy or sell sign? 
I also did notice the "smoothness" when looking at it from binance,
On a side note...Im glad my 50$ every paycheck allows me to buy a more liberal amount because of these prices!
Again, thank you Writejosh for clearing up my confusion.  If i could afford it, id give your knowledgeable ass some gold!

I have to make a friendly correction here. Gold WAS used as a payment method based on the social construct. But since gold has been used in electronics and will probably continue to be used as such it, it will maintain its value not just on construct, but also on utility. 
Agaim just a friendly correction!

I told him to stuff a dildo down his cake hole and keep quiet. He proceeded to tell me...ehhhm "shut yo dum honky ay-ss up for i sp00n feed you muh bawlz". We 1v1. i won 14-8. He quit before i finnished the final kill. ��Good times.

Ive come ro learn that if there isnt a sell off after wales have gained substantial earnings, theres a good chance you can expect one FAIRLY soon. Or atleast when the bots stop "working together", not to sure about what that means yet though.  At any rate, i welcome a healthy dip, as im sure those who wanna buy up at the "bottoms" do aswell.
SIDE NOTE: Anyone else feeling wierd about all this hype of a 100k bitcoin? Usually when news gets attached to bitcoin its usually when whales want plebs and first time buyers to FOMO in so they can sell at the shorts and burn thos wics...or atleast this is what ive come to learn in my 2 year ride. got in march 2018...yeah...i know...ive sold some in doubt and i thoroughly regret it. But have been buying back mostly due to the XRP and ETH battles. I figured there was movment happeneing with alts, money should be mov8ng to bitcoin soon. Then the bears brought it around 3.7k, then i really started going in....haha sorry for the rant!

When it comes to the act of defacing currency in the U.S its actually legal. The law your mentioning only makes defacing currency illegal if you edit the bill in any way to make it look like another bill.

The insider trading thing is the most dubious in my mind. Recently they started a new program where you just use it as a legit bank for USDC, they give you More USDC for holding their Stable Coin on their platform too! I cant remember the correct terminology for it, either way its a real carrot on rhe stick, ive thought about doing that coupled with holding. But the prospect of them using it against me was a real prpblem for me. I only use it to make small debit card purchases.

The biggest challenges right now need a constant flow of ideas that do/dont work to overcome these challenges. 
If i had the capital and a degree under my belt, id TRY to create a way to get bitcoin that indefinitely circumvents KYC. Some sort of decentralized portal to consistently purchase bitcoin. 
Why this? 
Ive been around d long enough to know that when the government justifies regulating something, its usually not the justification that incentivizes them to regulate it, and that its an alterior motive. Connecting your coinage to your identity isnt for money laundering, its to get a quantifiable number of people who distrust the established banking system, distrust in the government and want privacy over security. Money laundering is the last thing on their list.

I had thought about it for the longest time back in 2010-2015
I had seen the movment and wondered to myself the following; "If bitcoin can surge in ranges of price at these dollar amounts, what would happen in 1,2,3 and 4 years." It was obvious to me at the time and especially now that as more people hear about bitcoin, no matter bad or good, people from all walks of life would and will get curious and give it a modicum of consideration. 
I still didnt invest the 400 dollars i had put aside for it back in late 2010. 
It was like 10. to .12 I think.
1. I didnt have a bank account and didnt want one, so wire transfer was out of the question. Such a small, trivial, navigable inconvenience kept me from doing it.
2. I had created my very own brand of FUD. I was certain that governments would put the kabosh to it. The very core idea of bitcoin as everyone knows runs against the grain of the current economic meta(hope im using that right). I thought by some way i could be thrown in jail for like conspiracy to commit illegal internet purchases or something, i was a stupid ston... 
3. I was a stupid stoner.
I THOROUGHLY regret it. So now i make smart purchases at perceived bottoms, only sold a little bit. Im still in the red by a couple whole percents, but i got time. :)
Tl;dr- I was gonna buy 400$ in bitcoin back in its infancy, but smoking weed and living a stupid stoner life clouded my judgment. P.S I dont smoke pot anymore.

As money stands right now, absolutely nothing. I remember JFK attempting to get get rid of the federal reserve bank (the centralized bank FOR ONLY the american government) and...well we know what happened to him. The plan was to make american money backed by real gold, even redeemable for for gold if im not mistaken. JFK was the second president to attack the Centralized Back. Andrew Jackson  actually defeated this concept, albeit a tough fight but none the less, he won. 
As far as the whole crypto being the NWO money thing, it really wouldnt be a hard concept to instill on the masses. A bar code or chip would be very easy to manage. Crypto is great, but it could be a "sign" of things to come.

Likewise, Ive seen and heard enough of it to know by now the effect is pretty negligible to price. I figure you need Atleast 9 figures worth and some decent sentiments for the kind of pump people expected.

I like this answer, but i feel obligated to ask whats the bottom? From the research ive done, this correction may bring us down to 1k-2k. Itd be a pipe dream to think it sticks at 5000.

1 QUESTION 
1.do you have a bank account?
Yes: link your bank to Coinbase. Use coinbase to buy it &amp; Hodl it
No:Use Virwox, then transfer to Coinbase to utilize the wallet functionality.
This is what i did with my meager 80$ first investment.

I didnt say people wouldnt be able to get into, even if its banned its not like people wont be able to still buy it. I mean drugs are illegal and you can still buy them lol. I dont know how many have wealth outside of the country, im sure its alot. I understand the whole concept of using BTC instead of fiat as a means to rid fiat. Im just beaing realistic, bud. The federal reserve is a non- government agency, but since it controls the wealth of a nation it has a lot of clout and push when it comes to getting what it wants and protecting its profits. Anyone who is worth there salt and has skin in this would be a fool to go into it and not get the basic concept of block chain technology and its applications.

There is not a snow balls chance in hell Bitcoin will do away with fiat. The Federal Reserve will have bitcoin banned before it lets it get away with disrupting it's cash cow anytime soon.

I would see if your vendor accepts a more "privacy" oriented coin if your doing anything that your grandma wouldn't do online. Contrary to modern popular belief, Bitcoin is longer as secure when it comes to private transactions. Monero is a good one from what ive read.
Stay safe.
