Here are some questions to generate a stimulative response on your end:
1. Pretend I'm the owner of one Wal-Mart. My customers come to my store for a reason, we're not niche, not a start-up looking to gain new clients. We already have agreements with our credit card payment processors and our fees are not the same as a mom-n-pops. Our customers have to convert USD to BTC to begin with in the first place, so what benefit would there be for us to begin accepting BTC? After all, they end up paying MORE to get BTC to purchase from us, unless the customer is already paid in BTC to begin with. --- the only reason to add it that I can see is if a competitor does as well.
2. Are there any blockchain-related events or potential issues that may arise, which may interfere with being able to promptly process a payment? Are confirmations required? 
3. Say we own a hair salon and employees practically live on their tips. How do we manage with BTC payments and since tips are usually the change from a bill, how can we really expect (without enforcing) gratuities to be paid just as well as normal?
4. We run a taxi service. Our customer has X bitcoin in their wallet. It's enough to cover the cab ride, but by the time we reach our destination, the market crashed and this is no longer true. What do we do here?
5. All it takes is a stolen smartphone for someone to buy with someone else's money, is this right, assuming it's not encrypted?
Some may be stupid questions, others may spur a bit of thought, just figured I would try to think of a few just in case.

I feel your pain. Sold 10k BTC when it was just under $1 at Gox even though I believed in it with a strong hold mentality - my baby was almost here and fiat became all too important.
I can't help but think back...
Although, would you have sold before $266 when you saw major profit? Or when it started to crash? Or the bounce back up? Or back down? I guess that helps a little...

It's still difficult to even reach out to individuals to join together to see the project through if you cannot even explain parts of the idea.

I understand your perspective and it's definitely a pro-bitcoin one long term, but the one thing that scares me - outside of my business mind - is the thought that our already overly "plugged in" world that thrives and survives from technology will take that next step. If it took over, think about how easy it would be...there would have to be brick and mortar banks with vaults, you can't have everybody saving their stash in their safe at home or wherever. The bitcoin ATM alone is a big target for street hoodlums looking to pull a quick buck - I'm sure it's in a public enough spot to prevent that, but the one thing that certain people will fixate on is the incredible wealth - find the big holders and hunt them down - after all, people have killed/hunted others for much less.
I think what needs to be considered is all avenues of life and how different they would be, in ways you may not really think to think, if bitcoin was *the* world's currency.
If my stash became $6 m from $55,000, I would also be concerned about how much that fiat is really worth. I think it's safe to assume it's still a high margin above the starting balance, but then again what if my son needs surgery or therapy for his autism and I need to cash out immediately, but we're at a low point, and I take $20,000, then it becomes $6 m and our fiat becomes useless and we end up defaulting on our mortgage - actually, that's an interesting thing to think about, since while we can evolve to BTC currency, fiat debt still exists and it can end up screwing over a lot of low to middle class people, including those that are just starting to get ahead.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:10:04
We can blame the second bubble on Gox, the first one is fair enough, but the technology was new and not really implemented or broadcasted that well. It was an easy market to manipulate and there were WAY too many early adapters with excessive amounts of coin. 
It hasn't been long, but there is a world of difference in bitcoin between then and now. 2011 it was new, 2013 it figured itself out, but we're still in the process of establishing all the right businesses, networks, and applications. It's easy to see, it's all unfolding before our eyes.
Now, that's not to say that a 'crash' won't occur, I'm sure it will, or at least to an extent, but not a crash in the sense that it was a completely speculative bubble as there is a base value (factor electricity, mining equipment, etc.) and value from use as well, speculation just adds to it - a crash may bring us under the base value temporarily, but that just means a chance to profit even more and to stack up on coins for the next "bubble" when speculation took us from the base price that followed the trend to $400 and speculated to $1,800 - just an example, and this is assuming we are on a bit of an S-Curve growth. Hiccups, "crashes" per se, they have to happen.
This post is still good for day traders, but I'm a holder as are many of us here.

I stumbled on a digital currency transfer site that was bitcoin based many years ago. I had an un-rememberable amount, $100 or so worth, probably tens of thousands of coins, but could not find it either.

I anticipated it mid last month. I got in at $215 CAD after waiting on money to do so. I'm not an expert, I just analyzed the basics and referenced some things I learned from March/April. My second belief is if we break $1,300 that we will reach around $1,800 before it comes crashing down and sub-$1,000 will not be an issue; my current (out of my ass) guess is we may dip to $5xx at lowest and get back to $700-800 pretty easily before going back up. Still, doesn't matter if it's an expert, they're all predictions - it just takes one buyer to change everything.

My 2 BTC today is still the same it was yesterday and the same it will be tomorrow. It's still the same share of the 21 million to be circulated. The interesting part though, is that we're at 12 million now and when our, for example purposes, world's GDP was much lower, every dollar was worth more, but now with a higher GDP they're worth less, yet BTC just continues to appreciate.

Yup, but at the same time, MtGox is not as in control of the flow of things now as before. BtcChina has taken the lead for much of the past couple of weeks. BearStamp has helped indicate the direction of MtGox.

Are my bitcoins taxed as income, or as capital gains?
Income that is earned through the exchange of services with another person, whether in the form of bitcoins, dollars, or barter; is included in gross income, and would be subject to income tax at applicable rates. Also these bitcoins could be subject to self employment tax.
In some jurisdictions, income earned through the process of buying and selling bitcoins would also be included in gross income, but would be treated as capital gains.
Note: The above interpretation is based on the assumption bitcoins are treated as a store of value such as gold, or other such commodity. If instead they are treated as a currency or debt, the full gain could be taxed based on market value at the end of each tax year. 3858 IRS Ends Currency ETN Advantage Simply put, the IRS never considers currency a long-term investment. Consequently, if bitcoins are treated as a currency, you will be taxed the same as holding an account in any non-functional (foreign) currency.

I now sit with 2 BTC, after previously owning tens of thousands and regretting the loss of them (sold for &lt;$1), so I've decided that I'll keep my BTC afloat and any further investments will be in start-ups when at all possible. There's still a lot of time to get involved and to pull a huge ROI, in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:53:27
What is it, heavy?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:59:09
I'm all for the belief that it will become regulated, and there will be a bit of a legal gray area for the first little bit. Think of when online poker started to become legal again, the regulations did not come before the decision. Of course, different jurisdictions.
I personally believe that it won't be out-ruled in the U.S. and due to the nature of the market, if it really is pulling an S-Curve type growth, I'm sure there will be some federal workers involved with researching and planning certain investments or protocols behind the scenes as well. 
Just think about the insider info alone, may be big enough incentive for some federal workers to actually take advantage of - why not after all, they don't get paid *that* good for the majority of them. I know information takes a while to get down the line, but a human is a human and a connection is a connection.
Silk Road take-down after this much planning when 51% attacks were previously feasible, even with the lack of understanding (assumption) on bitcoin before, indicate to me that they are supporting it. If there's ways it can be used to further capture illegal money, then all the better - if it's out-ruled, it will just be used for illegal transactions by Americans (generally speaking) and tracking will be much harder - for instance, there will be no trackable transfer into fiat via a regulated exchange.
Still, the dollar value of each coin means nothing to me. I have two BTC now and while I'm financially stuck and just getting by with a baby that's not even a year old yet, I still intend on sticking in more $ whenever possible. I'm in it for the long hold - my 2 BTC is in a cold storage...UNIT, along with most of my other possessions, at least until I'm back on my feet again.
This makes me think...what if we could supply a bitcoin to people that don't have it together, I'd say homeless, but it may cause difficulties, and it's best served for someone with some technology knowledge...but imagine a $500 charitable gesture to someone that's not that well off, where it's time locked and made available in a time when they get their act together, it wouldn't be that bad.
As a side note, one of the worst things about the price rocketing is that a lot of the people getting really rich are actually drug dealers that were already getting good money for their sales, but are now getting treated just because they were a part of this journey...sadly.

I've already made money doing it. Some people arb'd between BTC-e or BitStamp and BTC China and made $200-400 approx per coin. As the market gets bigger, that gap will be filled more with bots - that's my assumption.
In my opinion, there's no harm on jumping in when you can get a much lower price, then sit the coins at Gox and watch for signs of a reverse in trends or profit take as it uptrends. Just make sure you're verified!
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:12:48
Thanks. At this very moment I am sitting on a very small stash. There was a day when I had over 10,000 BTC, but I sold out at sub-$1 on Gox as my baby was about to arrive.

If you have to buy back in at Gox, you're buying back in at what you sold for. If the price drops, you buy in lower and have more coins, but the tied fiat value is the same. There's no where to arb from Gox; sending them back to BTC-e will negate your gains and probably put you at a loss - assuming you don't add swing trading to the mix.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:27:31
Weeks? It could be months. Are you verified already in both sites? I'd wait for the price to catch up...probably the best route. For original buy-in, it's worth the hoops to get maximum out of your investment. 
I used to arb alt coins and I did very well because of the hype and the difference in volume on exchange sites, but now things seem to stay along fairly well (minus China activity). 
You can make $, no one will stop you from doing it, just make sure all the numbers add up and waiting on cash to hit your bank when bitcoin goes up $300 more ... might end up screwing you over, right?

Why leave Etsy, you can accept BTC, right? I'm guessing it may be a fees thing and you have a client base already.
Edit: While not a direct payment, it seems many sellers do it and I'm assuming it is allowed. I just assume you would still get most of your sales in USD even after converting to a BTC marketplace.

I thought the hack happened after the bubble popped, or was new information found out afterwards?
The thing in 2013 was obvious. It hit mainstream publicity and everyone tested the waters, and then everyone got Goxxed. A great test of strong hands though.
I like the balance between exchanges. Breaking down a wall shouldn't always rocket the price and we have seen Gox snap back a few times already as a result of just that - walls spread over multiple exchanges of different sizes, etc. 
We have had many mini corrections. I doubt we can completely collapse, maybe under the 'base value' for a short time frame, but it will rebound and grow along with the uptrend - I personally believe it will form an S-Curve.

Asked a million times. Getting $ out of Gox is damn near impossible. You can wait till prices meet, but still...depositing $ to BTC-e is a pain and costly, sometimes even eats upwards of 10% of the deposit amount.
It has to be well calculated and timed and it's best with large amounts of $ and during trends.

The problem is that many writers are paid just a few bucks to go gather information and put something together. Others are just building their portfolio - their writing portfolio - and may not even actually know about bitcoin, even if they say that they do.

Generalizing certain bitcoin holders by their wealth is not something I am a fan of, but the stature of most strong holders is well enough that it should be accepted to consider them as all serious investors.

That's the issue. A decentralized exchange has been suggested and tried, that would be good too.
The escrow could serve for only non-disputable transactions: bitcoin transactions are made to be irreversible.
A third-party could be fooled. For example, someone sends a box with tracking, the tracking number is the proof, but the box is full of dog poop.
Of course some support can be implemented, but the base idea must be determined first and automation would be the focal point in my opinion.

However, if we look at purely BTC and assume the upside potential, I would say something like this poster's opinion would be about right:

I would have to say that the learning curve is different for everyone and this is mostly based on what aspects you want to focus on - some are interested for the libertarian features, while others like the anonimity, the ability to exchange through different currencies, others see the investment side, the speculation, and the news surrounding it, while some get into the hard nit stuff such as mining, security, developments, and even creating alt currencies.
Myself, along with many others, I have gotten a good understanding on the principles of bitcoin and how it can be used casually, but the mining and other technical aspects are something that I do not believe I have the base knowledge to learn in any reasonable amount of time - or at least without learning all that "base" stuff first.
Getting the wallet and all that was easy enough, I saw a simple step by step list that guided me through it. I can see how it would be for many though. Online wallets made it easier as well - however, I'm sure security breaches and scams have made it abundantly clear that many do not fully get bitcoin - you have to live the investment, live the life, and live in the community to truly understand it all.
Now, that's the perspective from someone that has entered and left the market many times, both as a speculator and as someone that just has interest in the protocol. I've never been able to afford to stash away much in BTC and usually I can only temporarily hold what I do have, so I can somewhat classify myself as a beginner still.
In regards to mining, I have never tried it and before it was due to not giving myself the chance to learn it all, but now it just doesn't seem profitable any more with the skyrocketing difficulty.
Yes, I do recall ignoring all the info on mining and certain other technical aspects for quite a few months before I actually took the time to read up on some of the basics of how it works, and before that...it was "bitcoin" but I'd be damned if someone asked me what a bitcoin was lol

True, unless you are set up to deposit to their bank and you catch the spread at the right time. I've caught it in a rally twice and they fulfilled the sale price even though I profited 10-25% at the time. I believe it's from the owners of Virtex.

I won't get into the subject much as it's not something I myself would find interest in debating or thinking into in depth, but I will say this:
At the rate mankind is going, ignoring what we have proven to be able to make and succeed at, do you really believe kids are getting any better by generation? I mean, sure hold off and hope there's less little Bieber-esque kids running around, then have one when you're 40+ and...then the dynamic would, for me at least, ruin it.
There's many ways to look at it. 
I sold what would have been almost $6 million at this very moment. Of course, that's to say there's no kid and I hold till now, surviving crashes, hacks, crashes, and more hacks, I'll take the other upside of true happiness (not sure if you have kids, but it is a DIFFERENT and composed happiness).
... cheers for the flash crash :D

I'm not buying myself, but interested in the responses. I understand the hash rate issue with bitcoin and if you look at the 2Th/s, well they should make $50,000 a month with today's difficulty once they arrive, but probably not even break even when they do arrive.
Still, there are other coins that can be mined and some are profitable.

Ahh, no, you just spend 24/7 thinking about the price, fluctuations, etc., just like the rest of us, and you missed profits just like I did, so now you sit with a small chunk of change in coins, literally, and you get to watch everyone else start to peel a greedy smile on their faces?

Assume the price of bitcoin goes sideways.
Assume break-even is 180 days.
Assume you take profit for 90 days and sell the equipment on eBay.
Do you still find yourself in the negative?
++ Assume bitcoin isn't the only coin you can mine.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:10:08
I suppose it is a bit of an empty suggestion as I'm viewing it from my perspective. Alt coins have their place. He is willing to accept higher risk. 
I see you did not pick out the ETF suggestion. What's your standpoint on that? I'm just thinking of how to not directly invest into BTC as it is easy for him to get pulled around, as many new, weak bag holders do.
Now, there's also the NEO and BEE bank, but I'm not completely educated on the profit potential for that investment - it would run him into next Spring / Summer before he has a full understanding on what they will bring to the table.
With that said, LTC returns are just as noticeable.
 
If we were to suggest something easy, a set and forget, even accepting high risk, do we see BTC as a good option? If it scales 10x he makes a decent amount, but that requires coins to be $5,750 at the moment.

I know. Weird analogy, I'm guessing that's why, but it's true...we're not experiencing dead cat bounces every month, so if it's a bubble, this is just the starting strip ... $1,000,000/BTC now makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:36:55
There are two main ways that I can see it going in regards to the money in / out factor.
1) You buy at BTC-e, sell at Gox, withdraw and play the waiting game - weeks or months. This is how long till you have fiat. Then you wait for deposit to BTC-e again and repeat. By then, volatility may be much lower as right now it's speculation hype and not much (lived) adoption, so you may only get one run at it.
2) You buy at BTC-e, sell at Gox, wait for prices to line up, buy BTC at Gox, sell at BTC-e, wait for BTC-e to fall behind - a bit difficult.
In reality, you should be able to play a slight gamble while arb'ing where you may risk your profit margin to increase it tremendously. This can be done by playing swings. Buy the very bottom on BTC-e, sell when it rebounds on Gox, or sell the very top on Gox; you don't necessarily have to sell immediately if you just bought at BTC-e as the market may have an obvious uptrend at the time. These are cases where fiat ROI is very nice and deposit/withdraw fees are negligible, and when you can repeat without cashing out as prices will re-align at some point.
Just as long as you can control the emotions, you may watch it double in price while you sit with fiat, or it could go the other way and you're golden (if you will risk buying in a crash).

Public meeting may be necessary, especially to ensure WiFi access (if applicable). 
Building those relationships would be good, especially when you hook people that invest $xxxx every single month. Startup would be cheap and maybe it transitions to an ATM in your most client-dense area, then start targeting different locations on foot/by vehicle.
The idea of "call and I'll meet you!" is pretty cool though. A 24/7, fair priced alternative to local bitcoins.

Just think about what moves will be made in the LTC market. People think it's a horrible time to buy LTC, well it's a horrible time not to sell, which means it's soon a great time to buy. A quick switch ahead of those that will cash out on Senate news into BTC, and then snap back in when things level out and just before LTC gets back up again. Just my two cents, but I live in Canada and the government rounds that down, so I guess it isn't worth **** 
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:34:12
1. I would not be concerned about $150, but keep an eye out for any news regarding the safety of your account at CoinBase - you can always switch to your own wallet, whether it's on that computer, a different one, or a paper one.
2. It's good to read up anyway.

That's part of the problem, the website can have all the facts possible, but the random person that stumbles on bitcoinnewsxyz.com would probably believe something they find on, say, the MarketWatch Blog first, even though that post could have many major holes - as I have seen before.
I think with some more elaborate planning that it would work, and a lot of the aspect of the idea 'taking off' has to do with the overall development of the bitcoin world - in applications, as an investment, and as a virtual storage of wealth. 
Then again, do we believe that public media will start to understand and speak the truth after a while, or is that completely unrealistic?

I have a neutral POV, just trying to be a little contradictory as it is common among those that are uncertain. One comment I do have though - stuff like Future Shop reservations, where you could actually pay online, then pick up in 45 minutes or whatever it may be, would be a great way to introduce it at first.
