A site error is not the same as throwing my money to the garbage man. Not like I sent it to some random address. I 'transferred' it between accounts. Something about manually adding an address, then using it immediately as a transfer. Just be careful.

For the record, this exact scenario is what 'got' me:

Yes, the scenario was that I created a new address, then immediately used that new address (possibly before it sync'd in their database, who knows). Whether it was a one-off or repeatable, I have no idea.

The logs of transfers to specific keys in that wallet were deleted, so.. calling it a loss and moving on.

That's fine with me. Sadly, I missed the boat every time. I'd sell when it went up and missed all the big jumps. I think I've only lost money, especially when we account for lost BTC and transaction fees. But they close your account if the IRS just wants to look, or if they have to report? This also affects my (software) customers, as I was also a merchant. I dunno. I am just glad I didn't have more in there, or more than what I have pending in deposits. That's a whack thing to do to someone if you ask me, but their TOS makes me sure I'd never want to be under those restrictions anyway. I mean, some of these are so broad. I just don't like the idea of someone telling me what I can and can not purchase (legally). -- AND this also creates a unique tax issue for me, as I don't have access to the documentation I need to compute gains or losses (pretty sure it's losses).

Well, most people think of them as a bank -- and a bank doesn't just close your account, or tell you what you can spend your money on. I promise you I *never* spent money on *anything* illegal. 
So, you can be glad of that until it happens to you. Take a closer read of those terms of service. They cover so much. Debt reduction. Real Estate. eCigs. 'High risk businesses' (that one is so broad they can call anything a violation), Bail bonds. Collection agencies. Porn (not me! ;p), Financial instruments. If all you do is invest, they should be fine. I made the mistake of thinking I could, well, you know, actually spend Bitcoin.
OBVIOUSLY, were I doing something fishy, I wouldn't have spent directly from Coinbase, who in the world would do that? So it makes me wonder. Had I known about their ToS I would have made no purchases at all, as it is too easy to be ensnared by one of their many 'gotchas'.
I understand their desire to keep Bitcoin's image clean, since it started off kind of 'dirty' with the Darknet and what-not, but this is a bit on the absurd side.

I promise you I did not send any money to anyone on the Darknet and I do not gamble, so no casinos either. I am not into taking those kinds of risks. Looking at ToS, did I violate *any* of those rules? Well, it's hard to answer to be honest, as they are so incredibly broad and subject to interpretation. Maybe when I purchased eCig juice it did it.. I dunno. And you say, "Serves you right!".. but ask yourself, WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD EXPECT SUCH EGREGIOUS TERMS OF SERVICE?

Software --  -- and it *is* (for 20 years now).

They give you time to withdraw, but the process isn't as clear as it could be. Pending transfers DO go through, but they aren't shown, so you may think it's all closed, but then another transfer goes through, etc.. Anyway, at least they don't just straight-up steal money, but still Coinbase was a service I did LIKE and RECOMMENDED to many people. Sure, I can live without them, and never would have recommended them if I envisioned or read such insane Terms of Service. However, I would like an explanation from them as to what exactly was the reason my account was closed. Exactly. Maybe it is just a mix-up. I will never know, because I was given no chance to respond.

Even Banks don't have a terms of service that tells you how you can spend your money or shutter accounts on a dime like this. So Conbase seems to be even worse than a bank :o.
