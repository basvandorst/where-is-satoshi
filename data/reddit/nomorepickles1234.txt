I've learned to cook, rather than buy prepared meals or go to restaurants. Saves a lot more money than you think. Cash saved = BTC. Even if BTC ends terribly, I still changed my life for the better because of it

The best way to find the truth is to use multiple sources and see how their stories line up together, always keeping in mind the difference of fact vs opinion, which seems obvious, but it's easy to lose track of that when you're digging around

If I tore up my fiat, the I wouldn't be able to buy bitcoin....
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:50:36
I had 42 bitcoin, but they all fell out of my pocket when I was on a rollercoaster at six flags
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:51:44
Of course! Bitcoin never sleeps, after all
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:26:42
It was. It returned as a zombie to roam the earth terrorizing the villagers in the small town of fiat

No gold needed, friend. I mainly come to reddit to shit talk anyway ��

Just like how you can own fractions of an american dollar (cents), you can own a fraction of a bitcoin.

Theres a sell button. I had to use it to pay hospital bills once :-(

Bitcoins can be used to do illegal things like buy drugs, guns, and sex slaves. That's why they should be illegal. They're the only currency that you can do illegal stuff with

I'm just wondering if the lamestream ever found out who that "4chan" hacker was

I feel like people have been saying that about bitcoin before bitcoin was even conceived

Write all possible options on post-it notes. Stick notes to wall. Blind fold yourself. Spin around 10 times. Throw dart at wall. Whatever the dart hits, do that

I get paid hourly, so I can do as little work as possible and watch what btc does. In the end, money comes from somewhere
