I just tried it on my phone, got the same problem. I will fix this tomorrow. It's most likely caused because of a failure in the script. Thanks for the find.
EDIT: Should be fixed now. However, the site has not been made compatible with phones yet.

Then by that same logic would bracketed tax rates be bad too? Since they benefit the poor.

Inflation and deflation aren't linked to the ability to print money. You could make Bitcoin inflationary and you still wouldn't be able to print it.
I don't understand the bread example, maybe you can break it down for me.
As for seigniorage, I have no problem with that.
As for "deflation rewards the producer", from a fiat perspective this true but is self defeating. If too much fiat is produced the currency will become inflationary. From a crypto perspective this is true, but deflation still comes with the drawbacks I listed in my original post.

This is wrong. Inflation has an economic function. It prevents economic stagnation. Low to no inflation results in investors holding onto their money rather than investing in businesses (aka the economy).
It also results in people using bitcoin to maintain purchasing power (converting to fiat when needed) rather then using it for its intended purpose, transfer of wealth.
Deflation and inflation aren't necessarily bad, just solve 2 different problems.

Devaluing USD isn't a problem, it's acrually the primary function of inflation. It requires you to invest if you want to maintain your purchasing power rather than hoard your money.
