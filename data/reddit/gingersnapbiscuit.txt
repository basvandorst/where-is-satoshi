The person you are replying to is just sharing a workaround.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:03:12
Maybe don't be such a dick to someone who is just trying to help you out.  You had already written those coins off as "lost" and this dude is trying to help you get them back, no need to be so cunty about it.

Yeh, no money was laundered till bitcoin existed. What was it HSBC were caught doing with the Mexican cartels, was it laundering bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:35:43
Not if you bought at $1 :D

"I did this before the format became WILDLY popular and things happened much quicker".
No shit.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:13:39
But you should provide evidence of these supposed characters flaws besides "they did an AMA on Reddit one time and were drinking during it".  Thats not evidence of the personal flaw being discussed.

Yes and no. I sort of get where he's coming from. If a recruiter contacted me on linked in and said 'I'd like to offer you a job' I'd be open to that. If a client contacted me and said '&lt;product&gt; isn't working!!!' I'd tell them to mail support. Now obviously in this case support aren't working. But I'd still not engage over linked in. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:10:18
It really doesn't.  At best there is an ongoing investigation so he can't speak about it.  At worst he stole all the coins.  So either its in his best interest not to talk about it or its in his best interest not to talk about it.
@_date: 2014-08-25 18:19:00
Wait so you don't think he's guilty of theft but you think he should be treated like he is anyway becaaauuusseee......
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:30:13
How exactly are you going to do that? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:34:28
"Innocent until proven guilty" applies too,  doesn't it?  APPARENTLY NOT. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:09:14


Have you any idea how many transactions there are that qualify as a "contract" on a daily basis? How absolutely mind fuckingly impossible it would be to implement a yes/no system of taxation for that number of transactions wrt the recording and notification of this? And that's just one little part of a HUGE picture. People who think we can just abolish taxes and have everything be ok are fucking crazy.

The initial comment was "he must go to jail, he is criminal scum".  He isn't a criminal.  He's someone who has been ACCUSED of criminal activity, however there has been no trial nor any criminal investigation which has implicated him, as far as I am aware.
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:46:37
These are all really really scummy things to do though. I guess when you're dealing with these kinds of people it's to be expected though. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 23:42:16
I'm not defending the guy I am saying he's already said he won't talk about MtGox.  Why this dudes thinks that asking him AGAIN after he's already said he won't talk about it is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:29:23
What part of "I can't talk about mtgox" was lost on you? 
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:33:41
I'm buying a bag of dicks for you to chew on  you nosey fuck. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:45:25
See, the thing you have to understand is they are only against money laundering which doesn't directly profit them :D
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:16:12
Should be. Rarely will be. Remember being slapped with a multimillion dollar fine is basically taking a small percentage of the profits the company earned from its illegal activities. Its the equivalent of 'punishing' someone for robbing a million dollars from a bank by confiscating $50k.
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:52:35
Ahh the old "its unethical to take teachings from nazi scientists" shtick updated for the modern day.  Love it.
@_date: 2019-02-15 17:22:14
They think Bitcoin is a fraud, not the underlying technology on which it works.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:21:33
Almost like op is full of shit :D
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:20:46
Its the highest on the page with like 7 options on it that you listed, yes.  They have lots of payment methods not listed here, and many of them are over 5%
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:45:15
You know what else can be used for money laundering?  Pretty much every form of every currency on the planet :D
@_date: 2016-10-25 14:23:58
Capitalism is working out great for everyone, right enough.
@_date: 2016-10-25 17:13:36
Using the only available system does not mean I support the current system,  it means I have a lack of alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 09:32:58
Marvellous attitude to have towards your fellow bitcoin savers. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 12:14:35
I think the main issue is like 75% of people who champion it would probably (try) to disagree with you here.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:13:00
They are doing a decent job of it so far. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:41:43
To be fair I've never had someone from the bank empty my account and run away with the funds, so I've got that going for me.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:16:22
Also I find it hilarious that people are baying for what's his face who stole all the Mt Gox money to be locked up. Happy enough for papa govmt to get involved when shot goes south. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:52:52
"Riggah-goo-goo, riggah-goo-goo" is also a song lyric, but if I saw someone using that in in place of the word "Rigging" I would imagine he'd get called out for that too.
