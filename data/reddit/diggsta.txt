Can't bitcoin use the raiden network? I hear this one is already ready.

So this is r/bitcoin. I heard it's not too classy.

Dear Scienceguy, I have drawn some lines too and my due date would be May 11. Care to take a look?  The lines seem more consistent, with all due respect... [ 
Or perhaps even end of June if history repeats itself more exactly, dropping very hard first one last time instead of rising and then rising very sharply but missing the due date.

I second that. At least initially. Last time when the Dow Jones crashed in late January, crypro started it's bear market. In the long run I think it will de-correlate.

?! BTC has more than quadrupled in less than 2 months in the past... Am I missing something?

I get downvoted for this and the Moon makes a video 1 day later (today).
Great sub.

only btc?

Currency is not money. Money has the added feature of SOV. Correct me if I'm wrong. But the bitcoin answer is probably the only correct answer.

I believe it's spelled hopium. And there was a lot of that to be desired in your post, young man!
Honestly, I've been thinking alike. What if this Giancarlo guy and his friends can push down the prices perpetually? I mean, can they do it? They will always have enough money to burn. And how the hell can anyone let the price be dictated by a paper market anyway?

If most traders think they have actual bitcoin, that's fine. As long as they get back the actual price in the future, I see no problem for the time being.
That said, I would always secure my own crypto.

Damn, so many passwords "cleaned" by the wife... I will make my passwords wife-safe should I ever have one.

Yea the overall market sentiment is "buy", and it has a continuity of a few months in crypto at least. Stocks are on a 10 year bull run now, which of course reaks of manipulation. And the crypo sentiment might be fake too, because this market sure is rigged as well. Anyway, we come out of a bear market now which is obviously the opposite.

maybe more relevant since liquidity and supply should be lower than with stocks. At least bitcoin cannot be inflated like stocks can.
