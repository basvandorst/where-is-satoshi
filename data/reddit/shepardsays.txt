He is right but vague on explaining the fractional reserve system. Fiat money is a monetary system of usury. It is simply money begetting money. 
"If our nation can issue a dollar bond, it can issue a dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good, makes the bill good, also. The difference between the bond and the bill is the bond lets money brokers collect twice the amount of the bond and an additional 20%, whereas the currency pays nobody but those who contribute directly in some useful way. It is absurd to say that our country can issue $30 million in bonds and not $30 million in currency. Both are promises to pay, but one promise fattens the usurers and the other helps the people. "
-Thomas Edison, 1921
"For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight. "

Bitcoin is not "volatile". Anybody who is claiming it is doesn't know what is happening in the rest of the world.
What a current volatile market looks like:
When crude oil goes from high of $116 a barrel to $45 dollars a barrel in one year- that is a volatile market.
When Venezuela is experiencing a hyperinflation of of 68% for 2015 with many predicting it could reach 200% by the end of the year- that is a volatile market. 
When the Shanghai Stock exchanged has gone down 33.57% in 2015 and the Chinese Government enacted legislation to prevent selling to stop the crash- that is a volatile market.
When Greece had a bank run at the announcement of a IMF default and were restricted to only being able to withdraw 60 euros a day- that is a volatile market.
When a "landlord" in San Francisco is renting out 6 bunk beds at $550 a piece amid the rental inflation in Silicon Valley- that is a volatile market.
When the U.S. Stock Market climbs to a high of over 19,000 after 7 years of 0% interest rates and QE from a low of 6,469 in 2009. With its high in Oct. 2007 being 14,164- that is a volatile market.
Now how "volatile" is Bitcoin?

I'm talking about the sub-units. A bitcoin would be 1 unit and a satoshi would be 100,000,000 sub-units. With fiat currency printed at a central bank the citizens of that currency only use 100 sub-units of a dollar or euro etc. With Bitcoin we can use up to 100,000,000 sub-units.
Unlike traditional currency as Bitcoin's value increase so will the value of its sub-units. This does not happen in regular fiat money. A penny will gain no additional value and its value has been eroded over the past 100 years to where it essentially has no value except its metal content. A satoshi will always have a value. 
Quite frankly, I don't understand why I got so many downvotes for the topic. I find how Bitcoin works as a currency compared to central bank printed fiat to be fascinating. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:20:35
See, this is my point entirely. I am not "in the know" on that because I do not work with the blockchain. As Bitcoin grows and becomes more user-friendly there is going to be more people like me who like Bitcoin, like using it, and are waiting to see how it grows. As time goes on there are going to be more people who need these advancements explained to them.
I didn't know it has been debate as a software switch for over a year. I just got wind of it because of its introduction and press releases. Press releases do not contain valuable information for the public. They are merely used to get positive attention. And used the correct way they can be propaganda.
This is why I think the debate should go on unmoderated or at the least limited moderation. Because only those who have a better than rudimentary knowledge of the blockchain and work with it everyday know if it is a good thing or bad thing for the blockchain itself.
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:23:42
Ah, gotcha. Yeah, that would be a pain.
But what I've found is when people don't work for something (even setting up a wallet) they don't value it. It doesn't always happen but it would be a shame to throw bits out at people and they just shrug.
What I would do for these situations (if they happen often for you) is to write a template email explaining the simplest steps to set up a wallet. That way you can send it to them during a social setting, they set it up on their own time, and then you send them Bitcoins once they've sent you their receiving address.

Of course there is going to be fanatics and hysteria. Except, that passion burns quickly and dies out. It happens with all debates. The more fanatic the position, the more energy consumed, the harder it is to maintain.
I would gander that there are plenty of people in the middle without a strong opinion either way, sorta the wait and see crowd. Because time is a great revealer of truth. 
I am the wait and see crowd. I waited and saw censorship. I waited more and saw the shady "stress test" of an anonymous company trying to break the blockchain to highlight the need for XT. My view is now less favorable of XT because of what they did. 
But my view is also less favorable of r/bitcoin's reputation as a go to place for new information. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:42:06
I don't understand the censorship because bad ideas will die out quicker if the debate is allowed. By censoring it is prolonging the amount of time it takes to reach a popular consensus on the subject. If XT is truly the wrong route for Bitcoin the community itself will shutdown the debate. I don't find XT to be nearly as controversial as not discussing it at all. 
Just my two cents...

No, the commodities and stocks did not become more valuable. It just took more dollars to buy them because the value of the dollar decreased. 
If the interest rate goes up I believe we will experience a historic crashing of stock prices and commodity prices. If the interest rate stays the same I think we will experience a historic crashing of stock prices and commodity prices. If the rate turns negative welcome to the economic problems of Argentina, Greece, Cyprus, and Puerto Rico.
Personally I think we have a greater chance of economic doom and a negative interest rate than we have a chance of the Fed ever raising interest rates.

That is because for the U.S. to admit it is a currency would mean they could not impose existing taxes on it. Right now as being defined as property or a commodity they have existing tax codes they can use without drafting new legislation. They also cannot tax it the same way they currently tax foreign currency exchanges (which is classified as capital gains or loss, and gains less than $200 are not taxable) because Bitcoin is not a foreign currency.

I find the penny regaining value anytime soon to be a long shot. When was the last time a penny could purchase anything? For that matter, how much monetary deflation would have to occur for a penny to regain value. 
A Satoshi however will retain value in relation to the value of Bitcoins. Always. Even if Bitcoin goes down it will still have a value as a sub-unit in relation to the the value of the unit. It will never go to a value of zero worth unless the entire currency goes to zero.
*edit- I should also note it cost more to mint pennies than their value.

Look, when I first heard about XT it was from news articles. I did not know exactly what it meant because the software was introduced as a "Tah Dah" moment as if we should thank the creators for saving us from a problem that didn't exist yet.
Naturally because it was new information I hopped over to r/bitcoin so I could read what other people thought of its introductions. Because I ain't too proud to admit there are a lot of people on r/bitcoin who are smarter than me  and more "in the know" than I am. My hopes were to check over and read the discussion from people who working everyday with the blockchain (I don't, I'm on the financial and monetary side of the Bitcoin community) to learn what they thought of it and how it would affect them and Bitcoin users.
To my disappointment, all I found was typical Reddit drama. That drama still hasn't waned because the censorship left many with a bad taste in their month.
If the discussion was allowed a consensus would be reached quicker. After CoinWallet's "stress test" I am very skeptical of why XT was release and its timing considering Big Banks are jumping on the train and Gemini is about to be launched. I would like to have the debate to be able to determine if XT would be the best way to scale for the community as a whole or if there is some shady business going on where it will only benefit the few who are pushing it. Or worse, it benefiting only those with big money/Wall Street interests.

My question comes because as it scales up and value increases those satoshi and bits will have more value in transactions. I started thinking about this as I stared at my convert of BTC-fiat and I really only know the value in relation to fiat money. Does this mean its value is pegged to fiat in relation to value. Or is it from bad PR where we don't comprehend the value of these sub-units as a stand alone.
I am aware banks and businesses use fractions of units more than 100 sub-units (laughing at the gas pump's sneaky 9/10ths price) but average people using fiat don't use those fractions in transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:17:27
The author does not explain the interest hike very well. The Federal Reserve interest rate is a rate set for borrowing. What this means essentially is it is going to cost more to borrow. 
Bitcoin does not have the same monetary rules and theories of fiat money. Its intrinsic value is not pegged to any fiat money. While its relation to fiat money can change based deflation or inflation this is not a doomsday scenario. 
I think Bitcoin should start severing as many ties with fiat money altogether following the precedent set by ShapeShift. They run all salaries, servers costs, and business expenses off of Bitcoin. I think it will be beneficial for Bitcoin to distance itself away from fiat as much as possible to hedge against centrally planned policy decisions.

For generations people put 90% of their wealth into their mortgages. And we saw housing bubble after bubble blown and popped.  I find that to be extremely foolish considering a house is a liability not an asset.
By putting 90% of wealth in Bitcoin that investor I'm guessing isn't just looking at it as an investment. They have extreme faith in its future as a currency. And I share that same faith. I'm not invested in Bitcoin the same way but I am still invested in its returns beating out fiat money in the long term.
China just started selling its stake in U.S. Treasuries. This is QE in reverse and will lead to deflation. On top of this, the M1 money supply (physically printed and minted money) is at its lowest level in decades. If these trends continue we are looking at a massive deflation spiral worldwide of fiat. Central banks will go bankrupt around the world if deflation happens because they are over leveraged.
So, I can understand investing 90% in Bitcoin. It is more useful. Cryptocurrencies are the currencies specifically designed for the internet and internet commerce. I expect great things from it, especially if the community can find a way to monetized the unpaid labor of the internet. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:16:30
I think there will be no drastic change either way. If the Fed raises interest rates they aren't going to raise them much. It is speculated they would only hike up the interest 0.25% and very unlikely they would even raise it to 1%. 
So, I am not placing too much concern on the interest rate. I am curious what is going to happen to the Bitcoin price once the stock market hits its next bear market or during the event of deflation.

To say "foreign currency" it is assumed to mean another nation's currency. Bitcoin is not a foreign currency because it is a nationless currency. It is a case of apples and oranges when it comes to terminology considering nearly all currencies move around the world. But the difference in terminology is important regarding the law. There are no laws on the books concerning a digital currency the U.S. government can use to tax it directly.

Well, in so many ways you are wrong, but it some ways you are right. The attacks going forward are going to be from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Government. 
Big Banks are jumping on board with investments (and top bank executive are leaving for Bitcoin companies) for the very simple reason they are in business to make money. It went from "It's the economy, stupid" to "It's the currency. stupid" really quick after the Fed didn't raise interest rates. 
The jig is up. Texas is taking its gold back from Manhattan to start its own full reserve bank and Utah has already done it (they even have American Express debit cards to spend gold-back tender just like cryptocurrencies). The U.S. Federal Reserve Note (FRN) is a bug looking for a windshield right now.

@_date: 2015-09-14 07:57:01
Not exactly. The interest rate is only the interest rate the banks charge each other to borrow from each other and from depositors as well. The dollar became less valuable because the Fed both lowered interest rates (meaning bank wouldn't have to pay depositors) and pumped digital funny money into the banks. When the interest rate does go up it means banks will have to pay money to each other and depositors to borrow which is a quasi way of limiting the money supply in turn limiting the money supply and lower the inflation rate.
The reason the interest rate even matters is because of how money is created in the fraction reserve system. Money is debt and all forms of borrowing creates debt. Hence, all borrowing creates money. If you take out a mortgage for $100,000 you instantly created $100,000 out of thin air by creating a debt. When you pay off that $100,000 or you default on the loan you just eliminated $100,000 out of the money supply.
By increasing the interest rate it means it cost borrowers more money to borrow. So, less borrowing happens. Less money is created, the money supply starts to reverse, inflation goes down. 
If the market is barely function at 0% interest rates and needs $85 billion "assistance" from the Fed every month then raising the interest rate would lead to deflation rather quickly.

On the monetary side of how money works the altcoin argument would not hold up. A dollar doesn't cease to be a dollar because of the design of the cash register.

@_date: 2015-11-03 17:05:37
I don't recommend selling and here's why:
It is becoming a safe haven against governments. To an extent it always has been because of how Bitcoin was designed. But what's different this time is people are finding their national currency is being devalued and they're afraid.
Another way of looking at it is the difference between having your money in the bank and spending it electronically (debit cards) and deciding to withdraw your money and only spend cash. People are becoming wary of banks all over the world. Greece was a good reason when you saw the limits the banks placed on withdrawing cash.
Another reason being in Bitcoin is good is because there are few places to make your money grow. I live in the U.S. where the interest rate has been 0% for years. I can't get any interest on putting my money into savings, bonds, or CDs. There isn't any investment opportunity from having my money in Federal Reserve Notes. 
Bitcoin in my opinion is also rising because of all the other bubbles. Right now we have a stock market bubble, a commodities bubble, a housing bubble, a credit bubble, a car bubble, a student loan bubble, a tech bubble. Just about every financial market has hit their highs and there's no more opportunity to get a return on investment. 
Corporate stock buybacks are at an all time high. These fools broke the first rule of investing when they decided to buy high and sell low. It's complete incompetence in investing.

The first rule of investing is buy low sell high. The U.S. stock market is way over valued. Corporations have been taking their profits and buying their own stock to boost their stock prices. They are buying high in an overvalued market. The only place they have to go is down. The stock market can't rise forever and it's at the peak.
Meanwhile they are starving their own businesses because of focusing on shareholder's profits. They are not investing in hiring employees or increasing wages. This is a bad idea.
Henry Ford had a thesis called welfare capitalism. He paid is workers an incredibly high wage for a good purpose. He wanted his workers to be able to afford his cars. The biggest mistake of corporations not investing in their workforce is their workers can't afford to buy their products.
Take for example Walmart, they are losing billions right now. The founder Sam Walton practiced Henry Ford's welfare capitalism model. He paid his workers a very generous wage. In return his workers were able to shop at his store. He invested his money in his workforce and they invest that money right back into his business in the form of increased profits. His heirs are going to collapse Walmart with their Greed.

I understand the reasoning by not wanting to keep them in the exchanges. If a flash crash happens and your exchange gets overload and goes offline you can't do anything.
I don't think a flash crash is going to happen. I think this surge may be the buy-in that creates the fly wheel effect. I am really hopeful this is the most serious rally yet. The one in 2013 was caused by Mt Gox. fraud and their trading bot. The demand was artificial. I think the demand for Bitcoins is real this time with what's happening in the world. We've come a long ways in the past two years. 
Most importantly, think for yourself. I don't take advice off of Reddit or journalist writing an article. I try to predict what I think is going to do. If you disagree with me, that's great!

Not really. With owning a house you not only have a house that will cost you money maintaining (i.e. roof, foundation, plumbing, electricity, pests) you would lose a lot of money over those years paying property taxes for schools. It was property owners who were hit the hardest by public pensions and benefits for union government workers. So having 90% wealth in a house is definitely not wise. It is better to have a small home if you want property and diverse the rest of your wealth in other thing. 
"What gives you an edge over the market when it comes to valuing bitcoin?"
I use Bitcoin. Those who will benefit the most from bitcoin are those who use it. Yeah, some get in early on the currency and make a profit pumping and dumping it like a stock. But those who benefit long term from a currency are those who already adapt their finances to using it on a regular basis.
My prediction is once somebody finds a way to financially decentralize the internet (i.e. pay-per-click ad revenue) to monetize the unpaid labor force of the internet (same idea Ryan X. Charles had for Reddit) fiat money will die out. 
I predict this because of the "form follow function" principle of design. Central bank fiat money as we know today was not designed for our era. It was never quite the right fit for the internet either. It moves too slow from bank to bank. There are transactions fees that are unnecessary. I could go on. 
Once we can find a way to monetize the internet's true labor with Bitcoin it will rapidly increase the currency's velocity increasing the value astronomically.

The difficulty is trying to explain something they can't see but will understand with application. People aren't stupid and can easily understand Bitcoin once they start using it. But I think we need better PR to get more people to use it. If they can use the internet and smartphone (without knowing how they work) they can use Bitcoin.

Uh, some of us like laughing other people's expense.

I wouldn't use Bitcoin as a dating ice breaker. Most people don't know what it is and then some who've heard about it believe the "it's volatile and not backed by anything" propaganda. 
But I've found myself not being able to talk to people about what I do for work. Most think I am doing something illegal or Bitcoin is a fancy way to launder money. I've also heard once that Bitcoin was something only "smart people" could understand.

Well considering ZeroHedge is pro-libertarian, anti-fed, anti-government and a lot of Bitcoin users are pro-libertarian, anti-fed, and anti-government I suspect many readers on r/bitcoin read ZeroHedge. Maybe some of the anonymous users are anonymous writers for ZeroHedge. (Gasp!) 
I wait for your mind to be blown from my simplistic observation....

Well I'll give ya a confidence boost. This is not the same as the last rally or the previous rally. What is happening in China is because of the Chinese government devaluing the Yuan. This is in response to Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve not raising interest rates. Bitcoin is benefiting off the ongoing global currency war that is about to hit a fever pitch.

I was making fun of the BitLicense in NY. Actually I feel quite bad for all the Bitcoiners in NY. It's messed up.

Or people get anxious after the BTC surpasses the $300 mark and worry about a flash crash. We last saw these highs in July and they didn't hold above $310 and crashed down to $200 range. Your never going to entirely figure who is trading and why. But it is safe to say people or entities are in BTC to make money.

It's actually a good trading strategy. When BTC price hits a high you can convert to LTC on Shapeshift. Let the price drop and buy at the new low without ever having to cash out into fiat currency or pay fees. Don't hate the playa.

I see memes posted all the time on this subreddit. I guess they only have merit when a Bitcoin CEO or VC posts them on twitter first?

Bitcoin was created because of world events so why not its increased adoption?

The only point I agree with is to not invest more than you can afford to lose. Because that's when you cross the line into gambling. 
As for its rise in price I disagree with you. Bitcoin is actually becoming a safe haven in the global currency wars. Many signs are pointing towards the Chinese investing in Bitcoin right now. This is logical with the devaluation of the Yuan and government regulations. 
I read somewhere (source amnesia) that 57% of all Bitcoins are being mined in China.
No surge or bull run is the same. This is different than Mt. Gox and their fraudulent trading bots. I think we are getting closer to the flywheel effect.
I recently had my mom come to me and ask to help her set up her first wallet. The reasoning? She wants to us to use for inter-family transactions. She's known about Bitcoin for as long as I have but didn't have a reason to use it until recently.
