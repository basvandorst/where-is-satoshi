Companies in the space need to make their processes more efficient. Some exchanges sweep your deposit from your deposit address to another address in the very next block after you deposit. Not only does it double required transactions as your 1 deposit transaction becomes 2 on the blockchain, it isn't even necessary as they are transferring from a wallet they control to another wallet they control. Even worse they use high fees as though moving money from left pocket to right is a high priority transaction.

I got a phone call from my bank when sending to Bitstamp with questions about if it was my decision to make the transfer etc. Most likely scammers have been getting people to buying BTC via bitstamp. Blocking their IBAN is a simple if overkill method to stopping that scam.

Plan is ok up until you send their seed words in the post. If you ever expect any decent amount of value to be on these addresses the seed shouldn't be risked in plain text in the post. Giving them in person would be much better. If that's not an option you could obfuscate/split up the seed and send separately, and/or use a long passphrase. Also keep a copy of the seeds for redundancy, especially important if they are noobs. And as other person said definitely different seed for each person.

Taxable event =/= owe taxes. You will have made losses. Its useful working them out so that you can deduct from future gains

If you have a well defined strategy you don't need to second guess your actions. Like selling 10% each time the value of your holdings doubles. Makes it far easier to hold long term.

Some wallet fee estimators are terrible and way overbid on fees. Also some companies are very inefficient with transactions for moving internal funds ie sweeping deposit addresses 24/7 instead of batching at low network usage/fee times

Exodus is horrible for fee control (at least it was when I used it years ago).  You can currently send a transaction for 3 cents so your wallet is poorly estimating required fee. You want to sweep your funds into a wallet with decent fee control. From memory I think electrum is decent for desktop.

Tax rules on crypto are similar to stocks in UK. I did it myself but you can get an accountant. If you use a cost basis of £0, the main thing is getting the price points that you sell at so you can compute CGT, I just recorded those in a spreadsheet. If you are just going £-&gt;BTC-&gt;£ it should be straight forward. Crypto-&gt;crypto is when it gets tricky.

To the 4th bidder it doesn't matter. But the problem is we don't only care about the 4th bidder. The 2nd bidder paid $4 more than necessary. The 1st bidder paid 90$ more. Every bidder underneath the 3rd bidder has bid the price up to $9 when functionally they could have had the same experience bidding $0.

If you imported your private key then both wallets have the same private keys so your balance is shown in both wallets as either wallet can spend those coins currently.

Because a block is essentially an auction for transaction space. Your fee is your bid. Only the top 1MB gets in.  Overpaying on fees bids up everyone elses fees with no added utility.
