"Starting businesses is too hard" Has this man never heard of hundreds of thousands of etsy/ebay/amazon businesses? Its really not that hard to fill out a little paperwork to make your business legit. He's acting like starting all small businesses means you have to spend tons of money innovating some groundbreaking product and building your own factory. Joe Hippy next door has his own business selling homemade jewelry.

 Going from 19k to 9k is not losing 90%. Stay out of finance

Well then they aren't real complainers if they bought in, knowing they can profit. Unless you happened to buy right before the crash, which would be silly buying in at the peak, knowing your returns will be negligible anyway. You're average person won't make much with a fraction of a btc if it goes from $18k to $21k

 Not true at all for first time users. You can't learn from sites nobody's heard of. You can't watch a YouTube walk\-thru if nobody's shared one. Reviews? How are you going to read reviews when there are none? 
I won't do it unless thousands of others have already tried.

Except if you paid $500 rent 2 weeks ago in btc it would be worth about $400 right now. No, bitcoin is not always better

If my bank asked me what I was doing withdrawing MY OWN MONEY, I would tell them "Switching Banks"
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:11:41
Nobody uses cash so that isn't really a problem. Why would anyone need to have $4,000 in their pocket? That's what credit cards are for. Plus they have protection from fraud/theft etc. I'm a bitcoin supporter myself but this is just a dumb example
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:34:32
Can someone ELI5 why people actually meet in person to exchange bitcoins? The transaction fees on Coinbase are virtually nothing. Why put yourself in a sketchy situation just to pay a few dollars less?
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:38:14
That's the cost of running a business and they already plan for that when setting prices. That's why some stores give cash discounts and many gas stations have higher prices if you pay with credit card

If you paid $2500 for a computer that doesn't work, you have bigger problems.

I have a credit card I pay NO interest on and I get 2% cash back. I have a debit card through my credit union that pays me 1.5%-2.5% interest based on the total of my ENTIRE bank account depending on how often I use it. I have no qualms with generating money for my credit union. I have fraud protection for both and have been paid back in full the one time this happened to me. Good luck ever getting your stolen bitcoins back.
Like I was saying, I support bitcoin but in order to get the masses to agree, you have to give them expamples of how its better in real-world, everyday situations. Having too much cash in your pocket is not a real reason because this literally happens to nobody except when dealing with illegal black market sales. Maybe selling an old used car, but how many times will you actually do that in life?
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:50:24
Can someone ELI5 why this matters to Bitcoin holders? If you want to invest in Bitcoin, why not just buy them? Why do you need a Bitcoin ETF?
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:32:22
NK so behind the times. Bitcoin is more of an actual currency than investment now.
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:18:02
Moore's Law has long been debunked. Computers aren't 10 times faster than they were 5 years ago. In fact, barely even twice as fast. Pretty much any computer from 2010 still works fine with today's technology. We've gotten to the point where computers meet all of our media needs (music, movies, gaming, communication etc.). No real necessity for technology to improve much from here on out, besides making things more energy-efficient.

Trump winning will have no effect on Bitcoin. Brexit vote never really affected Bitcoin. Greece's bankruptcy never really affected Bitcoin. The Silk Road closing didn't even affect bitcoin that much.

The sprint (investing) period is long gone. We're now at the stable, "using it like actual money" period. Nobodys getting rich quick from bitcoin anymore. Just like nobody gets rich quick off ForEx.

What made you want to use that exchange in the first place? What made it sound more appealing than a well-known service like Coinbase?

No shit. We all know this. You realize  you're in the Bitcoin sub right?

Why would you pay someone else to hold your bitcoin? Not to mention, have to pay again for taxes on it. I'm not really seeing any advantage to that.
edit: Rather than downvoting because you don't like my answer, would you care to say why you disagree?
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:59:07
Think about all the smart, professional people who are unemployed or working minimum wage though. It really makes my blood boil to know that there are great people in this world that get passed up for jobs when morons like this lady get hired. There are more deserving people in this world than her. If she really cared about her job, she wouldn't be mouthing off to clients. I wouldn't feel bad at all.

If you're a good investor, you don't throw all your profits into a money pit (maintenance, insurance, taxes, gas, depreciation). Quick way to lose everything

Nice clickbait title, OP. The company did not call you as a terrorist. The uneducated receptionist at the desk was just spouting off shit she heard on Fox news as her opinion. And that was BEFORE she was even aware that you were into it.
If your bank or the government freezes your accounts and charges you with crime, then you could say you're being accused of terrorism. Right now, you're just begging for attention.
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:01:50
I'm with you there, she does not deserve to be working there. You still were not directly called a money launderer or a terrorist by the company. 
This is the exact reason why she should be fired. Because someone will eventually find a way to  sensationalize her own personal opinion so that it may seem like the official stance of the company

Sorry, but you've gotta be delusional if you think now is the perfect time to buy. When youre at ~6600 per coin, thats still way too much for everyday people to be able to actually invest with confidence. The reward just isn't worth the risk yet.
 The price is just too high to reasonably believe you can double your money within a year, which is what so many people are after. This is NOT A GET RICH QUICK OPTION. This is not the bitcoin of 2016. In the big picture, we are still in all-time-high territory.
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:11:37
Why do people care about this?  Bitcoins more valuable than ever. Let's not fuck it up
Edit: eli5 why this would be better?
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:44:22
So would be be similar to a stock split? Like 1 btc at 1650 would become 2btc at 825 each?  
Lately my btc purchases have been in fractions of a btc so transfer fees haven't really been that bad for me.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:16:06
Explain? I've been out of the btc loop for several months. Haven't kept track of anything but the price so far. Now it's all segit this fork this and idk why.

why would anyone willingly give a multimillionaire their money?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:19:57
Sorry but if you bought at over $200 then you did absolutely no research and didnt know what you were doing. You can't be a victim of hype. I waited nearly 2 months before buying at $35
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:40:26
What the hell are you gonna do with a physical coin? its pretty much worthless if you cant trade it for anything

Why doesn't everyone just use coinbase? Its so fucking simple
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:40:16
I know I'll probably get downvoted but this is pretty shitty IMO. You can't pay bills or buy a beer (.2 isnt enough to buy drugs off the SR either if that's what they're into). Plus its gonna cost money and time to convert it back to cash. While I'm all for giving people bitcoin and introducing them to it, tipping someone in the service industry who needs every dollar they make probably isn't the best way to go about this.
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:09:08
where does he mention coinbase?
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:48:45
buy now. itll still go higher
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:58:41
as long as you have less than $10k at a time going back to your bank when you sell, you have no problem.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:13:34
Im waiting till $5. Then I will buy a hundred

You can't really pay taxes on a barter. Bitcoin is not legal tender and you cannot pay your taxes with it. That would be like trading a pig for a mountain bike. Its can only be considered gains/income when its converted to USD
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:50:53
OP wants everyone to spend so his hoarded coins can gain value
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:04:36
now, its always going to go up until the limit is reached
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:23:37
You can sell bitcoins too and get the money in your account the next day
