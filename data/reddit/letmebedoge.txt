Is there any special way to discern the address to which exchange belongs?
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:47:33
I can understand NOW.
Thank you.
I'm glad your id resembles mine.

Thanks for your excellent summary.
You must have been an outstanding student in school days.

I understood Sunlot's plan as follows.
If I have 100 btc in Mtgox,  
(1) I get 25 btc(25%) immediately, 
(2) I get a small part from 16.5% stake, 
(3) If they find all other lost btc in happiest case, I get (75 x 90% = 67.5) btc more.
So, in happiest case, I get total 92.5 btc plus small stake.
It's a nice plan, if it is accomplished well.
Even if in worst case (they cannot find any more lost coins), I get 25 btc plus small stake, It's better than liquidation.

You mean when hacker hacks the server he can 'disable' the daily limit setting?
If then, the daily limit 0 or 1 should have disappeared.
Or hacker should have reset daily limit again after stealing?
Sorry, English is not my mother language. I am afraid my intention is expressed well or not.

I meant mt.gox account.

Is there any proof of  2.96m btc deposit from TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK / THK to Mt.gox in blockchain? 
If there is no proof, it is obvious that Mt.gox made fake bitcoin from air.

I've signed up.
This is the best way for now.

P.S. ; And, if you purchased BTC at mt. gox, it does not appear in your gox wallet. Instead, it is reflected in your "account balance", too.
The address is only for deposit, and always "0" except for the moment(seconds) btc deposited.

I think 'setting limit' means even if hacker came in my wallet with my user ID &amp; password he cannot withdraw btc more than daily limitted btc.
Even though I try to withdraw my own btc, I can't withdraw only 1 btc if I have set daily limit 1.

"Community owned exchange with transparency" is very desirable plan.
It's much better than savegox plan.

I downloaded the file by mistake, but deleted it without opening it.
Is it OK? or my pc is infected by malware?

In general, the winner appears later with smile.

I am a newcomer.
What's the meaning of decentralized exchange?
And what's the difference between centralized exchange and decentralized exchange?

I was verified in Jan 2014, and my line is "No trades found"
(because I recorded my balance before gox black out,
I can find which line is mine)

Bitcoin builder traded Goxcoin until Mar. 4th. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:12:52
Thank you for your kindness. Your explanation by door and window is easy and execellent to understand the daily limit.
Then, after all, setting daily limit for preventing stealing is useless under server attack?
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:46:48
I wish my explanation would be be help for you.
Your Gox wallet is only for depositing.
Once you deposited BTC, your BTC automatically sent to Gox wallet again.
And your deposit wallet become 0 BTC.
Instead the amount of BTC shows up at your account balance.
Good luck to you.
I also have 18 BTC in Mt. gox.....
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:05:50
I support it.
This is the best way for now.

And if the hacking(buying by false account &amp; withdrawing btc) was made during bitcoin-price-low-period, the fiat loss could be small comparing with btc loss.
@_date: 2014-08-19 11:02:38


You are right!
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:47:50
I cannot understand so many downvotes on very imoportant information.
Gox insiders may be throwing multiple downvotes by many IDs to blow out the issue.

Depositing fiat to Mt.gox took a several days in general.
So, before site shut down, some users might have deposited money to buy btc in low price, and it took a long days and might processed on March 1.
If then, why only 1 user?
I think only 1 user is not reasonable.
And, before and after that day, no user.

My positive opinion about Bter.
1st, Users can withdraw their USD,CNY, and NXT.
2nd, Users can withdraw their another altcoins.
3rd, Bter get bak lost Bitcoins from hacker.
4th, Users can withdraw their BTC.
5th, Bter re-start the trading.
My altcoins are frozen in Bter now, but I sleep well with hope.
