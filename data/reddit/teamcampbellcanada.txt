I'm also new to the bitcoin arena, and reddit as a whole. The cynicism that I've read prior to joining is the reason I didn't join earlier, and it still keeps me from posting quite as often as I might like too. Maybe I'm just overly optimistic about mankind but I'd prefer not to think the worst of people all the time.
PS: Doesn't everybody want tips? I don't really get the logic.

Ouch! Yeah, I've got my first child on the way and though I may not have a whole lot of disposable income, I'm determined to make the most of it. Just finished paying off my student debt at age 27!

Cool. I'll have to look into that. I like the idea of freedom from the traditional financial systems we have in place.

Great post, and good luck to you and the Renaissance Youth Center. 
I also read the article about NYC Parks repainting your project. It's a real shame, and I've got to admit I kinda laughed when Bert Irons was talking about the salmon color. I think comparing a park named after your father to the White House might be just a tad pretentious, especially given that NO paint color was fine in his eyes previous to your efforts.

I suppose that's better than preferring sex with your birth mother.

I have to agree. Even adblock software is funded entirely by user-determined donations. The model is pretty clear - I think the "honor system" has shown to be successful for content that is worthy.

It's not my company? I don't even live in Toronto anymore. Sorry I forgot to verify my e-mail in a timely fashion and for proving my fears true. &gt;_&lt; Geez. Thanks for the rest of the reply though! 
edit: do you prefer cold storage, paper wallet, or a combination of both?
