Wow that's pretty cool I thought you would be still be able to feel it! It's unclear how many currencies it supports though does it support them all or is this strictly Bitcoin? What's the risk of this being made out of any harmful materials that could poison you or possibly kill you if something bad would occur while inside you? And would this restrict you from travelling in anyway for example going through the airport gate? I would be worried if this would trip some sort of alarm.

Not sure what you mean I do look up multiple sources for information. But if there is a problem with buying currency on [Bitcoin.com]( wouldn't be best just not to buy there? 
Appreciate the extra links though thanks!

What is it like? It looks like on the x-ray there it's quite big. Does it move around a lot when you move all your fingers? I've seen some videos of it but nothing about a full review one of them looked like someone was having trouble tapping to pay in one of the [videos]( does it do this all the time?

I got a message from this guy as well thought it was a good idea at first but I don't put much money into anything when trying it out. When I confronted him with my questions he didn't respond to any of them but showed me a link to a post of his saying the same copy and paste message in the picture above.
