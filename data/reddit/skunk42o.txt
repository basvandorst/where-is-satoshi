that would make it daytrading then, or close to it. No offense, but daytrading in a volatile market like bitcoin is not a good idea and should be left to the absolute pros of this bussiness. I can't tell you what to do but it most probably will just be a loss on your side, unless reaaallly lucky

Okay right, what if I have a very bad accident and can‘t remeber afterwards? Theres upsides and downsides everywhere my freind
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:39:20
so lets say you bought at 12500$ and you wanna set it up so it autosells at let's say 11500$? Idk what purpose tat would serve else than losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:49:06
ok fair, but I only care about GDAX as that's the exchange i use.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:52:09
Doesn't. Coinbase runs on my name, used credit card of my father, no problems occured.

Why dont just link em your passport? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:01:15
Does it make a difference?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:40:48
it has been on 11k+ for like 5 hrs
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:24
Also this haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:27
Well that‘s why I said theres always ups and downs. No such thing as the perfect solution, either way has scenarios of one losing it all.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:52:59
tbh I guess I'm not a very meaningful source, i HODL for 2 weeks only. I chose GDAX because it seemed very common and is also linked to Coinbase (Coinbase = GDAX), which is the only insured exchange I know of.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:42:40
yeah but still, don't do it man. you saw that 700$ about half an hour ago? well it fully recovered, could happen to you too and then you sold at low and forced to buy back at high, or stay out of the bitcoin game, both ways wouldn't favor you.

Never recommend an investment to family or coworkers, they will blame you in 95% of the cases

where does one hire a prostate?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:44:05
well it's a bit of spread between the various exchanges, but I mainly focus on GDAX as that's the only one I use.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:25:11
vielen Dank
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:22:22

@_date: 2017-12-11 21:17:32
Well theres a difference between an exchange (GDAX) and coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:24:14
Bitcoin will hit 50k EUR by May 25th +- 1 Day
mark my words
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:56:44
Gdax requires 2 legal document for verification while coinbase only requires 1

@_date: 2017-12-06 09:38:53

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:47
what a tryhard
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:54
well you shouldn't leave your BTCs on an exchange site for a long period to begin with. Sure if you just started and are at 100$ worth of BTCs like me then it isnt really a big deal.
But in general what you want to do is transfer then to an offline or hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:54:15
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:54:39
get a software wallet and use recover or import wallet function on the wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:54:26
just HODL friend

But wasn‘t there recently the g20 taking place? Didn‘t follow it though, but just to let you know if you didn‘t either, your info could be outdated by now
