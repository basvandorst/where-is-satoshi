I know people misuse the "CEO" title constantly, my point is that it looks dumb. You're obviously a pretty smart guy, I'm not calling *you* dumb, but this one decision is silly. CEO implies a lot of things, at the very least some sort of organizational structure. Most accurately I would say it implies you report to a board of directors, [as the second sentence in Wikipedia suggests]( It's the equivalent of a teenager who plays in his garage labeling himself as a rockstar without any humor or irony attached to it. It makes it look like you're trying to appear more successful or accomplished than you really are. Most sensible people in your position would use the title "Founder" or "Project Lead". I would have personally used Project Lead since there wasn't really much "founded" in the way most people would view it (no product,  incorporated entity, revenue, or any assets).
In Silicon Valley it happens all the time, and I assure you people are constantly mentally rolling their eyes at these "CEOs" and take them much less seriously as a result. I'm being tremendously pedantic but I felt the need to clarify because I know I sounded like a dick. 
Why didn't you guys ever get the money? That sucks. Seems like a lot to leave on the table.
My impression was that the purpose of Toroken was to create and implement a sound technical design. Is that not the case? You say there isn't a sound technical design available, and there are open problems, but isn't that sort of the point of projects like you started? To solve those problems and create these designs? I guess I don't understand the logic of starting a project like this, seeing that no one has solved your problems for you, and then calling the entire project a failure and shutting it down.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. I've never heard of terms for funding like that (requiring a crowd sale), but it makes sense. Thanks for the responses.
