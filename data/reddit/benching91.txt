I'm in the US and not sure if its only prime here. I've been looking most of the afternoon and it looks like its okay to order through amazon because everytime the nano is plugged in, it has to pass attestation. If I run into issues I'm probably just going to return it.

Assuming the address you entered was correct, they are really backed up. It happened to me in the past. It will show up.

Is it safe to buy the ledger nano s on amazon?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:15:13

There is a buying limit imposed if youre just starting and you be able to get 1 BTC. Ask yourself if you can risk that amount right now in life. If you can, buy.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:39:09
Yes you did. You always want to be in control of your bitcoins.

Okay thanks for the response. I made smaller buys and nothing is showing up. Card or bank account. I'll wait a night then see from there. I did make a buy early this morning that went through right away

He's just mad he didn't buy at $700 last year.

Hey, I did some looking around and it should be fine to order on amazon. I eventually got to the ledger site and they talk about passing  attestation. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:01:18
Any amount that you aren't afraid of losing it all the moment you buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:39:41
Nope
