Gavin Andresen -  "It would be even more destructive to mine an eleven-block-long empty chain, then wait until the slow chain gets 9 blocks until announcing it to the network.
Or keep them guessing; choose a chain length at random, from 1 to some secret N, and orphan that many blocks at a time. Allow a couple normal blocks, then do it again.
It would be impossible for exchanges to know how many confirmations were safe for deposits and would be a nightmare for their withdrawal accounting.
I'm not even sure this kind of thing should be considered immoral-- majority hashpower acting selfishly for their own economic benefit (both short and long term) is the basic incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work."

Can't disagree with that.
"Existing centralised services (banks, paypal, etc.) are often faster, easier to use and provide consumers with a lot of protection"
That is too much to stomach. I can't think of anything that's wasted more of my life and had me paying more in worthless fees than banks and paypal.
