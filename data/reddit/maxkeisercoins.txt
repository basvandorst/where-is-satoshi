One of the better ones I've seen so far.

What way is that? Panic selling into a thinly traded market? I'm pretty sure anyone with a shred of a brain cell knows not to do that. Not sure who the amoeba level IQ was on BTC-e last week though. :D

Good for you, I'm holding most of my coins as shares of Neo &amp; Bee and am doing quite well on the investment.

If they haven't been moved, I wonder if he lost the key. Most were donated long before the more recent of spikes. They were donated to support upgrades, then became more valuable, why not upgrade?

If anything, Satoshi would donate a large stake of his coins to everyone equally should the value reach the proportions that you're speaking of.

Yes, sign up for an account, Havelock is awesome I've used them for a year. Then transfer the coins over and then buy shares. You can put a price above market value so that you actually purchase shares (I doubt putting a bid in right now will ever be filled, same as an exchange during a bull market)
Let me know if you have any questions I have lots of answers.

I say we start a new donation, similar to the one relating to Ben Bernanke.

If you're not able to differentiate between 'your' and 'you're' now, you're doing it wrong.

middlecoin.com + scrypt guiminer .... don't kick yourself too much for all the lost profits
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:08:20

Too true, yet look at that share price lol.

Your money is long gone. Probably diced it away.
