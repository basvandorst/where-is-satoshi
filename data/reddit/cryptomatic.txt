You're right... I want that too, working on it... but I don't just want to rush adding NFC because 1) may affect the accuracy of the movement and 2) NFC does not transmit well through metal... 
I'm also a hardcore bitcoiner and I want to make it right, not quickly...
Also, the "accessory" will work with the existing Cryptomats.

How about buying a real one that can only be bought using bitcoin? [cryptomatic](

What grant-olson says is right. The Swatch group is cutting the supply of Swiss made movements, however there're still ways to buy them or use alternative Swiss brands like Sellita. However, the choice of a Japanese movement for the Cryptomat was intentional. Satoshi chose a Japanese pseudonym for his paper, so I chose a Japanese movement :)

I've been using it for several days now, it's absolutely awesome. I was using keepass until now but this is so much better. The best part is that you can still use the same trezor to access your bitcoins... like have the password manager in one tab and the trezor wallet in another one.

same here... how do this scammers get their email addresses? I use a very specific unique encoded email address for coinbase that is not used for anything else, where did it leak?
