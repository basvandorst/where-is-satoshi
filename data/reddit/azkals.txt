You're comparing apples and oranges. 
You are not factoring in the market cap and the supply of coins. For example, BTC has a supply 16.7 million currently while the  crypto Ripple has a supply of over 38 billion, so it is only 25 cents. If the value of Ripple was to equal BTC, it would be worth about $4 a coin.

I'm not offended? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:52:34
I agree with your premise. I just wanted to make sure you weren't putting money in based on the price per coin of each crypto.

How about Mycelium?

Does Mycelium do this?

Jaxx or Mycelium

The only cases I know of are people convincing your phone company that they are you and getting them to port your number without even knowing

I'm in the same boat as you except I bought last night and then woke up to seeing it at $900. While I'm a bit upset I waited so long to buy it and then I saw it collapse before my eyes, I'm really glad I bought some.  
Now I'm waiting for my bank to approve the transactions and figuring out how to transfer it from Coinbase to my wallet.

Should I not use Mycelium? What do you recommend using then?
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:40:11
Jaxx and/or Mycelium are what I use

Should I be worried about my Mycelium wallet? What do people recommend? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:41:12
They pay a very high miners fee

I'm a noob. How do I get a wallet?
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:03:13
How worried should I be of getting my wallet hacked through my phone? Do I need to take additional steps to make it secure?

He's been advocating Btc for a long time.

I don't believe it is a $1 round trip.  Please let me know if I'm understanding this wrong and I'd happily start buying weekly instead of monthly. 
If I buy $20 a week of BTC for four weeks on Coinbase that's $2+ from exchange to wallet then another $2+ from wallet to exchange. Thus on an $80 investment I'd assume 5% in miners fees plus the having to pay a premium when I buy and getting less fiat back when I sell due to the exchange's spread. All together it could be 10% total in fees.

As someone who can't afford a ton of Bitcoin I am hesitant to do this because of the miner fees. Having to pay miners fees from the exchange to my wallet and then back to the exchange can be a decent percentage of profits when you have to do this multiple times.
