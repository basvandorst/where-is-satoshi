Yeah, this isn't a good sign.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:56:47
So what does this mean?

Glenn Beck and his viewers can fuck right off.

Do some fantasy trades before you get into the real thing if you're planning on it. I've lost 2 btc in the past because I'm an idiot who didn't know how to trade.

Who's upset?
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:36:26
Someone lost a lot of money...
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:39:31
Thanks for the answers everyone.

How exactly is Andreas scamming people? You must be a riot at parties. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:21:17
Nope.

Ah you're right. I cleared my cookies and that fixed my problem. Thanks for the help!

CEO of Coinbase wrote it

You must be an idiot. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:17:45
You led me down the right path. I cleared cookies and I'm served the correct English version of the site. Thanks!

Coinbase sometimes takes a bit. I've had to wait up to an hour before. You shouldn't worry.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:56:38
That works but I still get served the chinese version if I close out and go back to blockchain.

David Seaman isn't a finance guy or a technologist unfortunately. Take what he says with a grain. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:01:52
Exactly what I'm wondering
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:00:12
I didn't know this. I guess I should have read reddit more carefully.  Do they fuck up orders like this often?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:01:05
Silk Road is back.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:49:41
That must be an incredible feeling.
