A blockchain is not well suited to elections. 
The only purpose of a blockchain is for a group of mutually distrusting actors to agree on a consistent ordering of data.  Public accessibility, transparency , immutability are all just side effects of achieving that goal. 
Elections, at least in modern democracies, are highly centralized. Someone has to authorize you as a voter.  Even more important, the existing centralized power structure has to recognize and acquiesce to the results of the election.   As long as those centralized elements of an election remain, dreaming of implementing an election on a blockchain is pointless.

I've been around here sense 2011. The centralization of mining has not changed the culture, except maybe to discourage some of people who were drawn in by the technical aspects of hobbyist mining. This was always a relatively small group of people and would have been drowned out by an increase of other users anyway. 
In my opinion , there is hope that mining centralization will peak.  Asics dramatically changed the mining game by putting all the hash power in the hands of those who could fabricate chips. But there will probably be no order of magnitude mining breakthrough again. 
Asics will start to become cheap commodities.  Electricity costs and operational efficiency will be the sole drivers of mining profit.  Diseconomies of scale will emerge. Big miners need data centers and cooling systems and full time staff. They need to make a profit and they need to pay taxes.
Small operations can run in existing spare space, don't need extra cooling , and can be managed in the owners spare time.  Mining doesn't even need to be profitable if you are just doing it for fun or altruism. Paying taxes would be essentially optional for some people, further increasing their competitiveness

Quantum entanglement doesn't allow for faster than light communication. 
It would allow for unbeatable encryption, though.

$20,000 is not particularly large for a bitcoin purchase and definitely not large for a wire transfer.  Average wire transfer size is around $3,000,000 usd.  (Obviously dominated by non-individuals, but still : 
Also, the $10,000 cutoff for mandatory reporting is for CASH. Wire transfers , ACH don't count.

Assuming you mean talking about how wealthy they will be in terms of projected Bitcoin prices, then yes they were. Tons of 4+ year old posts detailing the case for $10,000 /$100,000 / $1,000,00 usd per Bitcoin. So far we are right on track.

Buying coins would be a hedge against rising Bitcoin prices. Since miners are naturally interested in rising prices, the only way they can hedge is by shorting.
