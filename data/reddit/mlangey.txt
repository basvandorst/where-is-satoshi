Maybe it would make sense for the content creators/distributors to partner with Kim for 'official distributor' or 'content creator' tag.

A fork in the chain is not an altcoin if we're all still calling it Bitcoin.

Maybe because the white paper had peer to peer in the title?

She refers to bitcoin transactions as 'blockchain receipts' - and wonders out loud if they're admissible in court.  Does the Silk Road trial ring a bell?  They've been admitted to the court of law already...

What a surprise, another lawyer who doesn't understand Bitcoin...

Yeah I believe that, but what about 90 days or 180 or a even year?  Scammers would typically prefer to be in &amp; out before they get found out, no?  Honest miners might wait that long, I guess it would be about finding a happy medium.  
I'd just hate to see truly scarce crypto currency burned when there might be a better option.  If you're burning altcoins or sidechain tokens then it's no big deal, but burning bitcoins should be avoided IMO.
Ultimately it seems to solidify your &amp; the authors' points about using other cryptocurrency solutions for the decentralized DNM.

Well, I was thinking time locked fees on the feedback &amp; reputation portion might deter the miner collusion without having to resort to the unspendable proof of burn. And honest miners would be more likely to participate to collect those fees and wouldn't mind waiting to collect.  You just make the lock time on the feedback fee transactions long enough so that it would deter reputation scams - 30 to 90 days?

Hey Gwern, do you think this can this be done with pure Bitcoin?  Why did the authors pick ZeroCoin and why do you suggest Ethereum for the feedback system?  Could CLTV solve any of the rep/feedback fee issues?
