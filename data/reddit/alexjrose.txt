Unfortunately all I see is a [descending triangle](

Don't try to change him. He won't surrender his views.

I'm guessing from your tone that you think I'm some kind of BCH follower, which I'm not. I asked you a question and next time you should answer it with evidence instead of sounding like a fucking child.

Why is it not?

I think is referring to the average of the SNP500 over the last 100 years which is around 8.9%. Successful investors like Buffett have got more, although the average investor apparently does a lot worse than the SNP average.

What's probably more realistic I'd the bots support new movement if it's big enough and sustained. If people are panic selling bots will change their behaviour and support the new lows.

I'm struggling to understand what you mean by ignoring all available data. Bitcoin doesn't have any fundamentals that indicate if it's a good investment, for instance there is no book value or earnings or even a run of dividends. In my eyes what makes bitcoin valuable is the hype that it can one day compete with the dollar as a stable form of currency. Please point out where I can find info that would help value bitcoin. 
I disagree that bitcoin will do extremely well or flop. It's extremely plausible that it could hit a peak and stay there for the rest of time if it gets no further backing but the fanbase remains behind it.

Depends if bitcoin is still seen as an off the cusp investment. If it gets backing then it could be a store of value like gold and go up, but if it doesn't then I would assume it would go down as people sell to keep personal cash flows going.

Don't wish to be rude but that statement is based off stock indices where for example the SNP500 has over a hundred years of data and the average over that time period is around 10% gain per year. We can't really compare that to bitcoin - a young and volatile single investment that at this time is doing extremely well. 
If we were to make a direct comparison and invest in all of the crypocurrencies instead of bitcoin (the leader) we'd probably get a much more similar gain.

This isn't a story which should be promoted. He's become a recluse and is ruining his children's lives by taking away any chance of a formal education. Bitcoin is a nice idea in that it gives power back to the people to trade goods for a fair price without unfair corrupt governments getting involved (Zimbabwe and Venezuela), but it's nuts to think that you can just abandon society and the way that it works because you believe in what is, right now, a cool gimmick.

What's semi log?

It's ridiculously irresponsible that he ignored the market. Everyone and their mum knew it was a bubble and was going to pop. What he should have done was cash half out and reinvested on the way down.

The lower it goes the more we'll all get when we buy back in!
