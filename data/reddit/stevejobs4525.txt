Bitcoin cash added too for minus 1 million points 
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:12:11
That’s nothing. Every time I take my dog out he leaves an ad for btrash on the sidewalk 
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:09:41
Lol at people still hodling btrash. Hopefully roger Duh will go to zero along with the shitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:38:23
Dodger duhhhhh
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:49:28
I saw a great interview with Roger Duh today, it went “duhhhhh Duh Duh Duh I’m roger Duh and I’m a shill for bcash Duhhhhhhh”
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:22:40
Cash -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; bcash. 
Just kidding.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:29:34
This is good. We’re cleaning out the shitcoins like btrash and will be back to business.
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:08:23
I also like Roger Duh
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:55:14
And still 100% shit
@_date: 2018-08-03 01:43:51
Bcash is a true shitcoin. Adoption is only due to appropriation of the bitcoin brand.
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:18:10
Roger ver will be selling Herbalife by then 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:13:59
Bcash is not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:22:17
Creating a shitcoin and appropriating the bitcoin brand does not make you someone to look up to. Hopefully he fks off for good.
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:50:31
So true. Roger ver signing up for Herbalife as we speak!
@_date: 2018-08-25 13:50:52
They’re shitcoins, not altcoins
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:58:07
DOWN WITH ROGER VER!
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:53:49
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:47:11
I’m surprised roger ver and his cronies get such an easy ride considering they’ve basically tried to steal bitcoin and have devalued it by association. Devalued the price, devalued the brand, and undermined adoption. The guy is a cancer for real crypto.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:59:25
Don’t believe anything said by roger durrrr

Warren Buffett look out 
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:22:21
It’s is $4k on one of the exchanges, probably where yahoo picked it up 
@_date: 2018-10-28 17:13:35
Yes totally, it sets that precedent. But capitalism has a history of causing short term collateral damage through innovation. There was a big profitable candle making industry before the lightbulb was invented etc. 
This is not said to ding bitcoin (I see the downvotes). We should be open to and thoughtful about all possibilities so we can plan for it’s success.
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:06:29
No but creating a huge amount of bananas v1.1 might render regular bananas worthless. This is the relevant point, shitcoins don’t dilute bitcoin scarcity (due to technical inferiority) but there’s no reason why a more superior crypto currency wouldn’t come along to render bitcoin obsolete and worth less. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:30:42
You missed the bottoms but 1 year target is $100k so plenty more upside. STRONG BUY.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:22:46
This is the bottom. STRONG BUY
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:22:01
1 year price target - $100k
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:22:07
Everyone is saying the price will drop from here. History says this is exactly the time to buy.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:41:24
To the MOON
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:12:17
Bcash is not bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:33:02
See the price is coming back up now. The best time to buy is when everyone is certain it’s going lower.  The best time to sell is when no one thinks it will drop (20k - dec)
@_date: 2018-11-03 04:51:17
Don’t mean to bad mouth your boy roger duh
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:49:32
I sold a few at 11k planning to buy back lower. Still waiting. You can still sell 1 now and buy 6 back in a month. This is a great time for long term holders to build up their stash for the next leg up. NO shame in maximizing your position this way!
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:32:50
I hope you all learn from this 
@_date: 2018-11-18 00:18:14
Just ironic because bitcoin cash is herpes-like

@_date: 2018-11-02 21:55:20
There’s bitcoin and that’s it. Btrash is a scam
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:04:35
You can sell now and buy back x6 at $500
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:40:44
At least we have each other 
@_date: 2019-01-20 00:26:05
Why am I getting downvoted? Surely legit purchases are up which is good for adoption?
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:46:40
You only pay taxes on profit. No one owes anything for 2018.
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:05:41
That’s amazing. Kenya is well known to be at the cutting edge of technology and financial innovation. This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:24:59

@_date: 2018-11-29 06:26:16
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:03:17
How much was for illicit purchases vs legal?
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:54:29
Please consider some index funds too, and don’t bet the whole kids college fund on bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:28:50
Of course it matters! Bitcoin’s success relies on mainstream adoption, as in legitimate people using it for legitimate transactions. If an increase in transactions is anything but this then it’s not good for bitcoin long term. We need to be looking at this data. 
Visa and MasterCard regularly report sales info from legitimate sales. Much of the argument for bitcoin is based on technical superiority to these platforms, and so I don’t accept that it’s not possible and not important.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:31:46
It’s really not likely at all
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:59:56
This. It’s the same for stock market predictions.

A doll house from Walmart is more likely

You only need a 600% increase and you’ll have most of your money back. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:58:44
They won’t 
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:08:19
Is that roger ver?
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:59:25
I still believe he has some kind of herpes on his face 
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:34:59
The drop is only when measured in usd. Measures in bitcoin it’s still the same. 1 bitcoin still equals 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:34:03
The why don’t they call it very-fastinflation 
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:16:29
It’s true. Despite all the distractions from shitcoins like bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-07-06 01:49:02
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:39:26
Bcash is garbage and roger ver is a POS 
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:03:46
Bye bye shitcoin!!
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:38:27
Crypto printing is out of control because of all the shitcoins like bitcoin cash
