I'd be interested in seeing this repeated with different gift amounts.  $10,000 I would certainly choose bitcoin, but if you go up to like a million, I'd probably choose gold being more concerned with a loss of value than a hope of gaining a ton of value.

No, the value is not static. The quantity is.  


Clearly it's a finite amount of gold.
Now, cut this cube into a bunch of smaller cubes.
You clearly still have the same finite amount of gold.
No matter how many times you cut the cubes up into smaller cubes, you're still restricted to the same finite quantity of gold.
Now imagine you lost half of that brick.  That is like what you were asking about above.  The scarcity of the remaining gold may cause the half that is not lost to increase in price given sufficient demand.  The scarcity is due to the fact that you cannot create *new* gold, you have more people exchanging smaller amounts of the finite supply of gold that remains, which may increase it's price.  But if you can keep dividing it down smaller, there can still be enough units for exchange whose value will be determined by the market, essentially whatever people are willing to value them at for the time being.
Inflation: the total supply of the units is increased (creating more gold than the original cube), making individual units worth less.
Deflation: the total supply is fixed or reduced, the unit size is reduced, but the units are worth more.
That's my understanding anyway, I'm not an economist or anything.

I'm not saying he was necessarily anti-government in an angry sort of fashion, but he developed a currency model to operate independently (which, in the eyes of government can be read as "in opposition to") of world governments, which would allow people the ability to trade in a truly voluntary way (you can be anonymous if you choose and are careful, you can avoid taxes if you choose and are careful, but you can also donate or pay taxes if you choose, buy drugs etc).  
Beyond this, to quote him directly:
"It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly.  I'm better with code than with words though." -Satoshi Nakamoto
Now you may say, "he was just pandering to gain quicker adoption" (and if you wouldn't, enjoy the straw man argument: :) )
I'm not going to assume your political affiliation, but if you were a "strong central government, pro Federal Reserve liberal" type, would you create your ideal monetary system to:
1) Be based upon a commodity style framework (probably poorly worded, I"m referring to the fact that you must "wastefully" mine bitcoins which have no intrinsic value themselves (though the network does, but those are separate entities kind of) and is somewhat similar conceptually to mining gold.
2) Decentralized so that it may inflate at a set rate, without having a central bank as a backup in case the free market "screws up" (scientific term)
3) Be capable of operating outside the control of law enforcement, tax agencies, etc
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." -Satoshi Nakamoto   (edit: copy/paste of Theymos quoting Satoshi in a similar thread)
Again, while he's not verbally sucking Murray Rothbard's dick or anything, in principle he is still following a libertarian principle.  Taking the power away from central planners and leaving it up to the free market.
In this user's humble and honest opinion, libertarian and/or anarcho capitalist are very reasonable labels to describe Satoshi. 
And even if he weren't, bitcoin as I said before is largely adopted (and very reasonably so) by people who think this way, so having links to areas where said people congregate on the sidebar (not a  bunch of posts gumming the subreddit up) are completely warranted and are in no way hypocritical as far as I see it.

I am.  On the come out roll you are paid on a 7 or 11. There are more combinations of 7 on a pair of dice than anything else, plus you get the 11, so not only do you have the odds in your favor on that roll, but then if you don't hit 7, 11 or a craps either you at least have a shot at the point (which obviously the house has either a 2:1, 3:2, or 6:5 edge) but at least you don't outright lose.  Roulette has at best 47% and if you miss that shot you're done for.  
Though, now that you mention it, I don't know how to calculate the overall odds of resolving a win on *any* given craps bet, which may skew this a different way.  But I do know that for that single roll, the odds are better on craps.
EDIT: Looked it up on Wizard of Odds
*CRAPS - Pass Line*
House Edge
* Bet made 	1.41%
* Bet resolved 	1.41%
* Roll 	0.42% 
*Double-Zero Roulette*
 Bet / House Edge
* Red 	        5.26%
* Black        5.26%
* Odd 		5.26%

An-Cap here. A reality of the free market is that there will be people who disagree with you.  I loathe the idea of *any* government intervention in bitcoin matters.  However, this technology is for everybody, and will serve our ends regardless of the intent of some users.  But the solution to go form our own community, where everybody has to PROVE that they believe in our same values in order to exist is the antithesis to liberty.  You're attempting to figuratively close the borders and stifle dissent, the same as those you're chastising.  Part of the beauty of bitcoin is that it puts the option in each of our own hands.  Anarchists and libertarians will find our way, while the statists go theirs, and in the end everybody should win. Also, governments were going too intervene regardless, these users didn't cause this to happen, even if they don't see the problems associated with it yet.  
That being said, to statist minded people, you should not take upon yourself the task of harming those who don't play by "the rules."  This system *is* rooted in these beliefs that you disagree with.  Your disagreement is fine, but know that ALL use of bitcoin benefits the bitcoin community.  You are not harmed by anybody who chooses to use bitcoin differently, just worry about yourself and they will do the same. Your use of bitcoin may benefit the state additionally, and that is your right.  By all means, do what you feel is necessary as long as it isn't hurting anybody.
Basically, can't we all just get along?

@_date: 2013-04-16 21:15:24
Luckily, you can play for play money on that site.  There is a ton to bet on with craps, so I won't go into ALL of it, but the basic strategy is you start with a bet on the "pass line".  The pass line wins on a 7 or 11 (on the come out roll), loses on a 2,3, or 12.  7 is the most likely number to come up playing dice because there are more combinations that equal 7 than anything else.  The first dice roll is called the "come out roll."  If it hits a number other than 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12 (so 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) that number becomes the "point." So now, say you've put $5 on the pass line and rolled a 6.  Your goal is now to hit a 6 before you "7 out" (a 7 AFTER the come out roll makes you lose if you're playing the pass line).  If you play the "don't pass" line then everything is opposite of what I said here.  Now, for either, once you have rolled a point, you can place a second bet behind your pass line bet called an "odds bet."  What you're doing here is risking more money, but if it hits you will be paid based on the true odds of the bet paying out.  For example, if the point is 4, and you have $5 on the pass line and a $5 odds bet behind the line and you then hit another 4, you'd be paid 1:1 for you pass line bet and 2:1 for the 4 (because it is less likely to hit than the "inside numbers") for a total of $15.  So, 6 and 8 are likelier than 5 and 9, which are likelier than 4 and 10.  There is so much more, but honestly, it'd be best to find a site devoted to teaching craps, I'm probably making this more confusing than it actually is.

People keep talking about how bad all these darn speculators are for bitcoin but I just don't understand how they can hold that positon.  Though the markets is crazy volatile right now, the price spikes and newbies "I'm gonna get rich off this" mindset has been essentially the biggest factor leading to new adoption.  If bitcoin was slowly growing 1% a year and still sitting close to parity with the US dollar, there wouldn't be half of the interest out there.  Sure, early adopters have accumulated massive amounts of coin, but eventually they'll sell.  The market may dip for a bit, but eventually they will be dispersed more.  And don't forget, though the cake is finite, there's no end to how small you can cut the slices.

Yeah, just keep in mind some of us practically live on this sub, so they see the same questions over and over again.  Then others have particular views of what is the "right way" to spend bitcoin (and damn anyone with another opinion).  Finally, there are those such as above in this thread that would prefer that you provide tangible evidence for such opinions, because there is a lot of speculation statements (in the sense of the word like "I think this will happen" not just the day-trading sense) with no evidence or even educated guess to support them. I don't think that is unreasonable to ask, though I agree with you that there is no need for hostility in conveying that message.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:32:37
Agreed.  I was just trying to answer your question.  It's a symptom of the lack of inflection in text, I took your question as just simply, "what are some historical reasons that some people wanted to switch from gold and silver backed currency to 'fiat' currency"
I wasn't necessarily advocating for anything there, just trying to point to a much better reference than myself.
On that subject though, I think having an option between competing currencies is fine.  If Norfed were still around I'd probably own some Liberty Dollar coins and certificates, in addition to bitcoin, securities, gold, and silver.  I can imagine some situations that physical assets can be more convenient than bitcoin, and vice versa.
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:40:38
I'm saying it's not just due to history, but because bitcoin is fundamentally routed in these principles, whether you agree with them or not (btw, I'm fine with the fact that you don't, it takes all kinds to make a world, and just about everything has *some* merit, and certainly we can all find some overlap which we can agree on).  I think bitcoin is amazing because it can be great for all of us, regardless of our respective beliefs.  I've also posted some further reasoning to back up my statements below that I won't copy here because that would be silly, but I wanted to respond to you personally so you could respond to them.  Your thing about r/austrian being the only one that makes sense:  I think it makes the *most direct* sense, but.. well, obviously you know enough about the topic to even bring it up, libertarianism/an-caps are strongly influenced by Austrian economics, so they still make sense.  It's not like the mods are trying to be exclusionary or anything, but having r/liberal or something to that effect would make no sense.  And if you think there should be no sidebar links of the sort, I at least see where you're coming from there (I know you didn't make the original post so I'm not attacking you or anything, just if you agree with mmcakes) but it does say "non-bitcoin communities" and could just as easily be missed by a user just reading posts.  I think having them there does no harm, but, like this thread we're in now, is related to bitcoin in a tangental (I'm pretty sure that's not a word, haha) fashion.

@_date: 2013-03-13 18:57:29
Yeah, as soon as I typed that I was like, "wait a minute, what *exactly* would such a group lobby for?" If there are 18,601 people in this subreddit, there are probably at *least* that many differing opinions on what is best for the system and what direction they would like to see things go.  It'd be easy enough to work out some polls and such, but the whole point is for things to be decentralized.  Tyranny of the majority is tyranny none-the-less.  Although I guess there would be nothing to stop competing groups to lobby for the ends that they see fit as well.  I foresee a lot of bickering in the future when these issues start to come to a head, no matter who the major players end up being.
TL:DR, my first idea was kind of hasty and probably would cause some form of community rift at some point.
Edit: the lobbying idea, I still think we could do the donation for legal advice thing.

I know where you're coming from.  Was in a very bad place myself, everything you mentioned above.  First, got very interested in technology generally.  Next, somehow drifted from a self described liberal into libertarian philosophies and became interested in economics and capitalism.  I'd always said I wanted to do whatever it takes to work for myself, and realized that my previously shit mindset was directly related to the fact that I was taking no steps toward doing that in any meaningful way.  Fast forward a little, I heard about bitcoin through r/libertarian and am now working hard on starting my own business, and I feel like a million bucks.  Like you said, the worst case scenario is that I go completely bust because of this.  But if that happens the mere fact that I *actually tried* will be enough to keep me happy until I come up with some "plan b" to try.  Glad to hear you're doing well.

This. I think it'd be cool if somebody made a site that posted a current average of the prices on all major exchanges.  Right now everybody just considers Mt. Gox's price as the best indicator of "true btc value" due to it's size.  Something like this might help to alleviate that a little and form a larger consensus price and perhaps more stability in these sorts of situations.

A mans son enrolls in the Air Force, and leaves for basic training.  A few days later the son returns, much too early to have served his term.
"What are you doing back so soon son?" The dad asks.
"Well, they took us up in a perfectly good airplane and told us we'd have to jump out."
"Ok, what happened?" the dad asks.
"We took off, and started climbing.  Everybody else ahead of me jumped out, but I just froze.  I was terrified!"
"So what happened then?"
"Well, my drill sergeant was furious and ran up to me yelling 'Boy, if you don't jump, I'm going to cornhole you all the way to the ground!'"
The dad raised his eyebrows.
"So, did you jump?"
"Well, a little at first."

They have everything to do with bitcoin.  They're the foundation upon which the entire concept was conceived, and where a large portion of its early interest was derived from.  Sure, the number of bitcoin users has grown dramatically and of course there are plenty of people with opposing viewpoints coming on board, but that doesn't change the facts.  And furthermore, the rules of the sidebar are guidelines for posts made by users and are not rules about what the mods are allowed to put in the sidebar.  You aren't forced to take part in these subreddits, nor are you forced to adhere to their beliefs.  There is nothing hypocritical at all about having them listed on the sidebar, just as there is nothing hypocritical about having CryptoAnarchy, technology, or any of the others.  They are directly related to, at the very very least, the history of bitcoin.

How can you first spend so much time arguing about a definition  then claim that that definition doesn't matter?  You state that the two are not analogous, I’d like to know, why not?


You can argue that, but you better have some arguments to back up your assertion. That's not even remotely analogous as a chair is in-animate and therefore can perform no such action. While I realize there is no such "thing" as a government, it is still a term for a collection of people who are capable of collective action.  In this case appropriating funds through violence and the threat thereof. 


This is an assertion, which you have done nothing at all to support.  Calling somebody idiotic is not an argument.  
Back to the thread topic: would you consider it theft, or rather extortion,  if an organized group sought "protection money" from a particular block of businesses under threat of violence?  If so, what if 60% of those funds were then funneled to, say, a community center or the homeless or some other charity?  Or a plethora of services?  Does the initial manner in which the funds were raised gain/lose validity (or change definitions for that matter) due to these circumstances?
If you find no issue with the above, then where does this group, or a government, or anyone for that matter derive their authority (in your mind) to make such financial decisions for others? Where do they derive the authority to carry out the threatened violence if the business in question does not voluntarily hand over the money?

The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, **or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means**."11
**The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies.** Accepting and transmitting **anything of value that substitutes for currency** makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.12

This will be true until it is not.  As acceptance and coin distribution grows, there will be far more people with much smaller pieces of a much larger pie - yielding lower volatility.  In the mean time, businesses would be wise to utilize a BitPay type service to hedge against the swings.

True, I started off saying it was a gross oversimplification.  Though what I said was true of some of the first banks in the country, as described in the above book.  The truth is that at this point in time, there are many practical ways that countries could be using a gold backed money standard now if they really wanted to, but those making the economic decisions subscribe to a different economic school of thought.
Anyway, I wasn't thinking about gold when I posted that.  I certainly agree that bitcoin is obviously much more practical for many purposes today, and solves many issues such as 3rd party trust.  You'll get no argument from me there.  Sorry, I think there's been some miscommunication here.. I don't really even know why I was compelled to comment in the first place, was just thinking about the fact that we're trying to exchange "bad" money into "good" money.  Only in this case, rather than simply having money flowing from one country to another, it will be moving from all countries onto the internet (provided bitcoin succeeds fully as a currency and not just a value transfer system).

Yeah, its mind blowing. But it takes a while to deprogram. I certainly can't say I never thought the way they do. You're born and raised within that mental framework with a ton of social and legal pressure to conform. Shit takes time, and seeing a positive example to emulate is much more intriguing rather than someone attacking you and shitting on your beliefs. I didn't get interested in libertarian thought from watching Ron Paul duke it out on TV. I got interested when Peter Diamandis started doing his X Prize stuff and showed an application of libertarian thought. I believe bitcoin will do the same for millions. But it won't if we alienate and attack people who are, quite rightly, concerned about bitcoins future, and that of their money. Give the experiment time to run its course and people will come around along the way.

I think bitcoin donations are a great idea.  I just think since it isn't commonplace yet, the conversation would be like:
"Hey, here's some money, but first you have to go download this client, then wait 3 hours to download the block chain, then we'll send you the money, then you can make an account at X Exchange, then wait for your confirmation to clear, then do an ACH withdrawal!"
"Uh, what?"
However, a bitcoin specific donation service would be fantastic, and could act as a middleman in such cases, making it convenient for we bitcoiners, and also for non-techie victims/services.

I was about to place a substantial disagree bet until I read the fine print.  It just says that anybody will mention bitcoin on the show at some point before August, not that Steven will give it the "Colbert Bump" specifically.

Yeah, I was definitely worried about that too.  I don't want to look opportunistic, I just really thought they could use it (it's his dad posting so it's not like genuinely giving money to the kid himself).  But if not that particular thread, maybe a bit tip donation drive subreddit since it seems like the bitcoin tip subreddit is more about technical issues and such.  Just a thought.
Edit: you're right, it wouldn't make sense to subdivide it since there are so many more users in r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:21:54
Honestly, I usually get irritated that every single time a bitcoin site has trouble people immediately blame a DDoS conspiracy, but you may be right in this case.  If you were looking for the perfect moment, given the news and all, to successfully cause a panic there really would be no better time than the present.

I think he said in the last update that they would not be allowing anybody to convert USD to BTC.  I'm with you though, that would be infinitely more convenient for me.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:57:24
Hmm, I wonder if they would count each individuals gaming as a single thing or if me losing 4btc and you winning 4btc the same day would be counted as a transfer.

Indeed. Less supply, more demand, higher prices.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:23:19
The thing is, at least from my perspective, it seems like the thing to do is accept BOTH bitcoin and fiat rather than relying solely on btc. Still allow the discount for the bitcoin price, but don't shoot yourself in the foot in the short term.  I love the idea of Bitcoinstore, but I think that it's too soon in the game to exist solely in bitcoin, and accepting other forms of payment would be a hedge against times that the price is in a meteoric rise.  Now, in the long term, I'd then wish them to go back to btc only.  I mean, that *is* the point.  But right now I feel like it's in *everyone's* best long-term interest for these companies to do whatever is necessary to tread water. Plus, bitcoin users that are afraid to part with coins at this moment would still have the option to support a bitcoin accepting merchant without parting with coins.
@_date: 2013-03-16 06:10:51

Some of this may be due to excessive traffic.  I keep getting logged in for a few seconds then the service error comes back, so it's probably all of us causing this to a large degree.

I'd be very interested to know as well.  If say, Bitzino does transactions solely in BTC, but doesn't allow any on site way to exchange for USD, is it a money transmitter?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:36:01
Sold some coin as soon as bitfloor came back up.  Take a piss. Come back.  Up from 70 to 100.  "Oh well, I'm going to make a bunch of coins off panic sellers on Mt. Gox in a few hours."  Log into Mt. Gox.  Deposit funds.  Oh wait, I can't transfer USD from Bitfloor to Mt. Gox and I have no coins to transfer.  Nice one dumbass, only cost you $1000 USD, but more importantly my stock of btc. Not the end of the world, but still.
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:17:00
If I understand correctly, BitPay will instantly convert received BTC to USD for a small fee.  I'm not affiliated with them or anything, but I see them mentioned often when these types of threads pop up. Takes care of the cash problem and helps insulate you from price swings.

Aren't the originally mined coins *only* worth about 100 million at this point?  Even if the price goes up by 10, a billion dollars doesn't seem like it would be worth the trouble for a government that size (especially given that bitcoin's success wasn't and still isn't guaranteed).  Or maybe I'm short sited, I dunno.

Bitfloor is great, but it does feel like you're in slow motion after Mt. Gox.  Assuming Mt. Gox isn't in slow motion at the time.  Deposits show up quickly, I've never had a problem with them like so many posts for competitors that I see.  Plus you can withdraw USD directly to your bank account via ACH transfer.
EDIT: while I'd known about the fact they had been hacked before, there are some [shady details]( about how the situation was handled. Obviously, I just heard about it so take this as nothing more than a disclaimer to check into this more, as I will.
EDIT 2: somebody in the linked thread says that the owner is using the current fees to pay people back slowly.

No problem.  It's audenx doing all the heavy lifting though.  Make sure to let him know how much money you had on there as well.  He's got a running tally of how much everybody's owed.  It was over 400,000 last time I checked (just redditor's money obviously, I'm sure the total is much more).

Wishful thinking. "This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency."
"c. De-Centralized Virtual Currencies
A final type **of convertible virtual currency** activity involves a de-centralized convertible virtual currency (1) that has no central repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort."
Centralization has nothing to do with it.  The group who makes the definition defined it as such and they'll do whatever they can get away with based on that premise.  I'm more than happy to give them the finger and operate as best as I can, but don't pretend that you can just say "there's no administrator" and hope that's going to count as a loophole.

I agree that the ultimate goal is actual bitcoin adoption, but as far as your tax situation, the BitPay thing seems to me like it would make things easier. Having to calculate taxes on bitcoin seems to me like you'd have to do them absolute last minute to make sure price doesn't fluctuate and screw you for paying too much/too little. Or do you even have to pay taxes on bitcoin before you convert to USD? *I* would personally want to keep my bitcoin and circumvent the process all together, but if you're running a serious business you've probably got too much to lose by doing that.

Do they even have Roulette without the zero's? Serious question, I've never run across it before, but I don't really play Roulette much.  That's just what they had a table for on that page, I wasn't trying to be dishonest or anything. 
I know the don't is better ever so slightly, but you have to get past the opening roll, so if I were just doing a one off bet I'd feel more comfortable on the Pass since the difference is so miniscule.  But I think that's where I'm confusing the odds of the roll with the odds of the resolution.
That said, I stand corrected having looked at the blackjack odds.  I always thought they were much worse.  I guess I must have seen a table for a worse variation or I just completely invented it in my head.  
Either way, you're right.  Thanks for the info.  Should have said a *better* bet (which depends on the answer to the no-zero's roulette thing I suppose).

PM to be added to the mailing list of updates.  He sent one out today.  It reads as follows:
Hi Bitfloor users,
 
The one new piece of information I have since the last email update comes from a NY-area lawyer who spoke yesterday to Bitfloor's lawyer, John Snyder, about the situation.
 
According to their conversation, Roman was initially trying to resolve matters with the bank on his own, but he hit some roadblock that caused him to bring in John Snyder. The bank still has not explained why it closed the account, and Snyder is now working his way up the bank bureaucracy to get answers.
 
Synder wanted to dispel any suspicion that Roman has stolen, spent, or run off with the money. He reiterated that everyone involved on Bitfloor's end is doing their best to return USD funds to customers as quickly as possible.
 
When asked to explain why Bitfloor's communication with customers has been so outrageously poor, Snyder said he understood why customers are upset but that Bitfloor does not want to post updates that consist only of speculation about what's going to happen, since they themselves have so little information.
 
Based on this, my opinion has remained unchanged since Monday: best to remain patient but vigilant.
 
 
P.S. If this is the first time you're receiving this email update, the previous update can be found here:
Also, when you PM him, tell him how much money you have wrapped up in Bitfloor and he will add you to the running tally, over $400,000 from Reddit alone.
