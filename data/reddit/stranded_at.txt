Something similar to Persona.im (ARK fork)  perhaps?

Wouldn't buy fireworks from this salesman.
It's just another fork. Perhaps minerscoin or mysterycoin would be more suitable name if he/they would like to rebrand(=moon) it one day.

The delusion is still extremely high @ r/btc, but it's been super entertaining so far.

He's kinda like Michio Kaku for Bitcoin. It takes a smart man and understanding the subject to explain things for common people.
He's doing excellent job at sharing information.

I also recently became a bitstamp user instead of kraken. I understood that they (kraken) are rewriting a better scaling platform, but atm it's garbage.

If chinese miners actually have to pay half-decent price for electricity from now on, that will level the playing field. Well, unless all chinese miners move to mongolia like bitmain.
At some point global warming will become a hot topic surrounding bitcoin.
Mining uses ridiculous amounts of electricity. I would like to see bitcoin change to POS or DPOS at some point, once alts have experimented with these enough. Though it might be too late for that.

Utilizing waste heat like they are about to do in Siberia would be a good thing.
As a minus, utilizing that waste heat mean's somewhat centralized mining. Distributing heat is not free at all if you have to start from nothing.

Shops generally don't accept multiple currencies. It's usually just one specific, for example USD or EUR.
If you hold the wrong currency, you will always need a middle hand &gt; Debit card or other conversion service.
Just thinking out loud an aswer to this guy in the img.
