Great point, saved. I’ll definitely be referring to this in the future as I believe many people here get sucked into the type of thinking you described in the last few paragraphs

Yeah my bad. Fixed

I meant in both situations, that’s why I gave examples of both a payment network(Visa) and a store of value(gold). Scaling comes with time and adoption. The block size will most likely be increased in the future, and things like Segwit, the LN network and atomic swaps are already in the works. Who knows what other breakthroughs will happen.

Exactly. Bitcoin as a CEF stock is a terrible analogy

Segwit2x does have replay protection in the form of opt-in, but I don't think I'm quite grasping your point that replay protection won't matter. I'm not sure I fully understand replay protection and it's potential effects even after a substantial bit of googling, please correct me if I'm wrong. Why will hashrate fluctuate between core and s2x? Is it because of the difficulty adjustments will make profit seeking miners jump from coin to coin? Just trying to get a better handle on this and learn as much as I can, so any material is also appreciated.

Yup, fixed it

You should do your own research. No one can tell you what to do with your money. There’s a documentary  called “Banking on Bitcoin” on Netflix, it’s a great primer for newcomers. There’s also a Tim Ferris podcast episode called “The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency”, I highly recommend that for anyone who wants to start trying to understand the technical side.

The slowdown of the network was taken into account  by Satoshi during the early days. I agree that the network is slow, but it’s not something that snuck up on everyone. The core team is composed of some of the most talented developers in the space and everyone involved has seen the scaling problem from a long way away. It’s is one of the top concerns right now, I don’t think it’ll be a problem as there are many solutions in the works. Maybe Bitcoin is a beta for something else (Ethereum anyone?) but it’ll always be around as a foundational layer.

Can you expand a bit more on your last point? Why is deflation a curse?

Actually, Bitcoin isn’t that similar to a stock. It might seem so at first glance, but I encourage you to do some reading about the way it works on a technical level. You don’t have to become a master of computer science to understand the basics, but nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed before, it’s a completely new invention and doesn’t fall under traditional financial classification. 
People buy Bitcoin as an investment and they’re right too. Again, I would encourage you to take a closer look at the technology. r/Bitcoin is a great place to start. Bitcoin has the capability to become much more widely adopted than it is now. It’s nowhere near the level that Facebook is at in terms of use, but a better example is another payment network like Visa. Visa processes almost 150M transactions per day. Bitcoin processes 300k. Strictly talking valuation, Bitcoin’s marketcap is at almost a billion dollars. It seems like a lot, but the value of all gold in the world is at 8.2T, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see Bitcoin’s eventual value approach that. Bitcoin is also deflationary - there will only ever be 21M BTC. Of course it won’t increase 1000x. But it will increase. Happy to discuss more if you want
