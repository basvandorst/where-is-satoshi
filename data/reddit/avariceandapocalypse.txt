% gains at this level are quite lovely. We are still at an overall low market cap for btc. Additionally, money is flowing through to btc from the outside as well as other cryptos being sold for btc.

Bitcoin and cryptos in general have many uses and one of those many faucets is a hedge against traditional currencies and the massive debt behind them. Bitcoin has a fixed set of 21,000,000 btc to ever exist, and those will all come into existence only after the year 2100. We keep hearing about the gamble on a worldwide asset like btc, yet we are ok with holding USD when the US is currently near a 2:1 ratio of liabilities to assets per citizen (  ). With this massive debt also comes massive creation of new money out of nothing. One could argue that cryptos do that too, but many times that creation of a new crypto corrects quickly or it takes value away from another until new fiat or non crypto assets are put into/linked to the cryptomarket. 
I think traditional investors see this, but the talking heads are scared to admit the truth. They just want to pump stocks that cost millions of people their livelihoods in 2008. The debt from that time still exists and is growing today.

Look dude. You are getting pretty upset and attacking someone over the Internet you don’t even know. I’ve been in btc for a long time and any chance I get to test something out I do. I hated the fork. I dislike bch because of its short-sited nature and the leaders themselves. I own it only because it was free from the fork, and I haven’t sold a single crypto in 4 years. I am still trusting lightning network to come out, and it will be great when it does. I was simply supporting the idea that there was a missed opportunity. There will be more and LN coming out itself should create more opportunities for the network’s growth. 
You are right that there was a lot missing before it had a chance to get implemented. I’m not saying it could have been done within that timeframe. The fact is that we have put a lot of trust to a small group of devs, and really I wish no time frame was ever given.  
Have I done as much as I could. Fuck no. There are people way smarter than I am working on this project. That being said, they weren’t realistic about the timeframe, and there is a lot riding on it. Big money and people on Wall Street don’t like constantly delayed promises though, and that is a big influence on the entire potential adoption market of btc. 
You are one of the reasons r/btc talks shit about r/bitcoin. It’s ok to criticize the team and where btc is and actually discuss it instead of getting butthurt when people bring a realistic point up. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:16:03
I know you are taking about the future, but no BS, when I talk to people about cryptos and mention FIAT they actually say, “FIAT? What is that?” It’s hard at first to realize that so many people have no idea what FIAT is, means, or how it functions, so you almost have to do a quick lesson with them on how that paycheck of theirs actually works not even considering the impact of crypto.

It takes 48 hours after a withdrawal request for the btc to show in your hot wallet. That’s the great thing about the vault. It goes slow and you get a ton of verifications to ensure it was actually you that put the request in. It’s great for hodlers, but not so for traders. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:22:05
2012 is when I heard of it and started the slow process of getting involved. It was a little different back then to just jump right in, but I got in more during the double digits. 
I have a life changing amount, but my goal for bitcoin is for you to not even think about the usd value. Rather I’d like for you to measure it in terms of relative wealth or the old “hamburger” currency valuation used in Econ to measure purchasing power of currency. Also, when I see paychecks paid in a crypto tied to btc directly, I will be happy. I make so many satoshis an hour or my salary is 6 btc a year. Things of that nature. 
Wealth is a part of it of course, but I had wealth before. I want change. I don’t want the powers to hold lives hostage like mine was held hostage by central powers destroying our economy. There are too many sons and daughters that were never met, lives destroyed, and loves lost because of a handful of greedy people that only got a slap on the wrist.

Agreed. Right now spreading the word, testing network upgrades and providing feedback, and trying to get businesses to integrate btc after the fees get reduced and LN is released is what the community should strive to do.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:27:20
I like bitcoin as much or more than the next person hence me holding for years now, but bitcoin definitely missed a HUGE chance this time around. Will other chances come, hopefully, but lightning network was promised to be completed in less than 6 months two christmases ago. I understand that it needs to be clean when it hits the network, and testing is what is needed. However, we could have been actively testing it as a community before the mass adoption and larger attacks started slowing the network if they even got close to the initial estimated timeframe. 
All this being said, I’m really optimistic for the future, and lightning network coming out may be an opportunity creator on itself if it comes out with little to no issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:33:29
You reduce your asset specific risk (unsystematic risk). Some bad things that happen may only happen to btc, but may not effect let’s say ETH or another altcoin. They may even see a gain from it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:00:45
You took one segment of the business transaction (customer side) and made it fact, when it’s not. Credit card fees kill businesses I’ve worked for especially the e-commerce ones. Imagine running a small business on a website and cutting your margins to compete with Amazon then also losing 3-4% just so people can pay with a card. That doesn’t even include the costs that the “cart” companies charge to store and process sales data. Even with shitty fees  for bitcoin AT THIS VERY MOMENT, the current company I work for does a $1k online sale (small for them), loses $15 on the btc fee (right now) and that’s it, and the transaction confirms within a day (again, right now).  They are hodlers who use coinbase anyways, so take another 1% just in case they do exchange making it $25. The same transaction just for the credit card fee would be $30 minimum, doesn’t hit for 3-5 days, and can be charged back. Now do this transaction 50x in a day. You saved $250 just on the fees in a day, $91k in a year. That’s a well-paid sales person to help build the business or money to buy capital. Again, this is basically worst case scenario on btc fees and best case on cc fees. 
This is all based on the bad fees going on right now for btc. Businesses are patient when it comes to getting their money because it usually takes forever anyways. This is just a blip in time in regards to btc, and the current transaction fees won’t be like this once proper scale is accomplished (not some bandaid).
Edit: I do agree that it doesn’t work for smaller transaction businesses right now though. Just consider the large amount of money flowing within the supply chain as well as higher priced items. Those are the businesses that are still doing better even with higher fees.

Agreed on diversification. I haven’t added to my btc very much in the last year. It’s mainly been into alts, but the overall value of btc is still the highest weight. We are going through a transition for btc, and most of the problems are starting to show up in the rear view mirror while the road ahead looks promising. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:15:06
Bitcoin cash is going to run into the same problem if it gains popularity. Litecoin and ether are better at this point in time than bitcoin cash, and both have better devs. 
I own both btc and bch, but I’m just being realistic. 
As for bitcoin, it has the advantage of being first and having a lot more devoted people, devs, and infrastructure that was created before this year’s boom. It’s still lacking in the scale, but the solutions being created are meant to solve fee and speed problems for the foreseeable future, not just for a small amount of time/growth.

It’s a suit for information. People avoiding taxes will get boned. Pay your taxes.
As for your initial question, if you want more security just on coinbase and you plan on hodling, just use their vault feature. Lots of people only hodl a small amount of their cryptos on an exchange  for quick liquidity. The rest they will usually store in cold storage/their own device. 
Read through this sub a bit and you can find some helpful ways to store your btc safely off of an exchange.

Coinbase/gdax is and has always established itself as the “white knight.” I know a few people there personally, and if anyone there was connected to something slightly shady, they would probably be fired within a week. It’s hard to trust a company in something unregulated like this, but Coinbase has more to gain from the trust of use rather than just the appreciation of btc. They make a killing off of fees, and it would be shortsighted of them to inflate the price. 
That being said, it is entirely possible that some exchange could be inorganically pushing the price up here and there with the lack of self and external regulation on some of these exchanges. 
Edit: Sorry if this makes me sound like a paid shill.

1. Tax wise, you record your invoice amount in USD equivalent at the time of payment. If you cash the btc out later, that’s when you do your capital gain tax. Charge a premium to cover instantly exchanging it (at least 2% I’d say)
2. Many people think BTC will be in the 6-figures within the next decade and 25k next year. If you depend on this money to pay bills and life needs, don’t leave it all in btc. There is high risk but high reward for btc, so you have to assess your own risk tolerance.
3. I would do the deal in btc and hodl personally, but I like btc and high risks. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:45:25
If newcomers stay,spread the word, use and hodl, then it’s a good thing. If they just test the waters and bounce, then yes.
Also, the more newcomers that come in and are converted, the more businesses will get interested. More businesses interested means more legitimacy and actual use. This leads to higher value. Eventually leading to a purely btc environment where we don’t pay 1.5% fees to exchange or have to wait for a limit order to go through.

Four years ago maybe, but not as much as paper money is nowadays. If you have Bitcoin at all right now, you would be losing all of your gains and freedom if you try to fuck with the IRS. Bitcoin’s value doesn’t really come from being able to avoid taxes. It is a more liquid store of value than gold and medium of exchange (needs work). If it was used by only 10% of the world, it would save billions lost in currency exchange alone.

A bunch of dumb traders that lose money in stocks decided to try their hand in Bitcoin directly, and now they are selling it because they didn't get "free tendies."

Assuming you are in the US, move to a state with zero state income tax (ie Nevada). Hold your btc for over a year. Quit your job to have zero income for the tax year. Cash out 48k in profit a year to pay zero federal capital gains tax. 
Zero taxes and you don’t have to be shady. I’m sure you can live off of your cashed out gains. I would suggest moving/quitting your job before December 30th and cashing out your first profit in the 2018 tax year.

In regards to btc price as it stands, we are still far away from btc’s price potential. There will be ups and downs, but just train yourself to hodl. It took a me 4 years to get used to hodling and ignoring the ups and downs, so you’ll get stressed a little during your first few dips/corrections.

First. Where are you buying from to get 15% fees? That’s a large ask/bid spread to pay even if you are using a credit card.
Second, there are two ways to gain wealth on btc. One is to trade. Basically as you described, buy it, hodl for a little, sell. The other is to just buy and hodl to the point where Bitcoin is used as the primary store of value as well as a means of exchange. Then you won’t have to even exchange your btc for fiat; you can just use it for every day items directly from a wallet.

To go further, set aside the money you want to use and buy 50-75% of that at first. Then if a dip occurs, buy more with what you left over. Whenever you can set money aside, just follow that sequence. Many long term investors keep some cash to buy dips when they are invested in something they believe will grow long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:33:17
If you sell your crypto, you pay your capital gains. Use the tax code to your advantage, but don’t cheat it or you’ll get fucked. It’s not worth giving up your gains that you didn’t have to do any work for to get.

Yes. Very small percentage of target market owns/trades btc. Still very early adoption. Btc market cap to gold (which it is said to replace) is only 2%. International companies have yet to transact it, and they can save billions in currency exchange. 
It all depends on your outlook. If you are looking 5-10 years out, then buy, look away, and hodl. Just like high risk stocks though, only put in what you are willing to lose. Additionally, don’t give into FOMO 5 years down the line when you say “I should have put more in,” because no, you put in what you could, and you made money doing it. 
Furthermore, diversify into other cryptos and stocks.
