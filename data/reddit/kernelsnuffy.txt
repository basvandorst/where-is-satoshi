it's probably not a good test of censorship if it's just a post people don't like

That is a pretty good deal and I have been really unsuccessful on cyber Monday. I have pretty high standards for specs so while I could have waited and got a $300 65" Wal-Mart tv I figured I might as well get what I want while I could afford it with btc
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:31:39
The probability of that happening is astronomically low, almost completely impossible, but still theoretically possible

his scottrade acct is 30% of his annual income, while his 401k is 3x his annual income

That's true if you want to go full bitcoin, but if you want to make a constant stream of money from arbitrage my method could work. To be fair I have no idea what I'm talking about and I may be completely wrong about this issue
@_date: 2013-10-16 01:34:37
yes, but it's pronounced Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:22:30
Didn't know that. I wonder if it would be possible to prevent that
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:47:13
I'll mostly replenish my account with fiat when i get paid on friday. For now I wanted to jump on this deal!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:54:22
Ideally, with a large enough bank account you wouldn't need to wait for the transfer to come through to take advantage of arbitrage. Just keep buying low on one exchange and selling high at the other, and you'll have the money stream coming in regardless.

I'm using Preev.com bitstamp prices, not gox (due to their USD prices being basically invalid)
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:46:44
Yep, their new target feature

if you are fully verified you can instantly trade 10btc i can see how that might not be enough for some though

He was threatening people doing something illegal with being caught? Are your blinders seriously so strong that you think this justifies having a person murdered?
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:51:00
how is it the defense of others? He literally attempted to pay someone money to kill someone else. In fact, he actually paid money for it, and thank god nobody took him up on it. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:36:26
I still don't get how you could possibly call this "defense of others" if he explicitly attempted to have someone killed for being "problematic"
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:23:31
the only part i don't like about it is how much more expensive they are

even against screenshots on the other person's phone?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:43:32
Yes you are correct on the non-fiat thing.
I understand your argument... I was just assuming some crazy perfect world where fiat currency transfers were as fast as BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:19:17
I was making a comment on the use of $x dollars which is redundant, similar to saying xBTC bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:52:03
Why would you need to move non-fiat between exchanges?
Buy BTC for low fiat price on exchange 1. Transfer to exchange 2, sell for high fiat price. Transfer fiat to bank acct from exchange 2. Repeat

I think that's a fallacy. Someone here posted something like this. Imagine a guy walks into a casino with $200. He's not rich or anything but $200 isn't bank breaking for him, so he's ready to lose it all. Let's say his total net worth is like $50,000. 
He gets on the blackjack table and plays, hits it big. He's been playing for about an hour and hits $100k (somehow, i know it's crazy, it's just for the sake of story). At this point his net worth is $150k. Then, getting greedy, with a series of bad hands, he is back down to $200, and leaves. He doesn't feel bad because he leaves with exactly as much as he came in with.
Now imagine this story. A guy with a net worth of $150k and a gambling problem walks into a casino ready to gamble on his $100k, and loses it all but $200. Pretty depressing story right?
Functionally it's the exact same thing!!! Why would there be a difference between the two?

I'm in the military so my tax rate is pretty low in general, I'll report it but a gain of $600 isn't going to significantly affect my tax rate
