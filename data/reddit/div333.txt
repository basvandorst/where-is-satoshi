If that happened value would likely increase

Transactions aren't cheap and fast compared to bch though, is it.

Cryptos will likely* prevail. No one knows for certain what will happen.

Sell at 4200$ and but it back at 3500$ obviously

I gave you the reason already - uncertainty. You can believe what you want, in fact we share the same belief and I won't be selling for a long time but you have to understand that just because you believe doesn't guarantee it.

Also known as cutting losses in the event in drops lower and never recovers but talk shit all you like =) there is a valid reason for people to sell.

You keep mixing my points up, lol. You asked for a "the reason" i said that people could have for selling now - the uncertainty. If people are uncertain they may back out, which I assume is what's happening right now. As I said before I currently do believe crypto will continue to grow in both usage and price, hence why I said I will be holding mine. Hope this has cleared my point up a bit.
