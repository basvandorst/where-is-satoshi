Because with most currencies, they lose value over time. BTC does not, which makes it lucrative for people investing in its future.

Call your local office would be a start, but I don't suggest it for layman--you can do more harm than good if you don't know what you're talking about.
It helps if you have a rep in public speaking and political work. Personally, I have a lot of contacts from general networking on my area.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:46:10
I do, but they're generally specific for whoever I'm talking to. Again, I don't recommend trying to talk to your representatives unless you are very knowledgeable about crypto from many different perspectives. There's a reason why lobbying companies exist--they do major research before covering their subject matter with a government official.
Unfortunately crypto doesn't have a lobby. But maybe it should...

I do have one! This just happens to be the spend wallet whose address I had onhand.

I actually have an appointment with my senator's office to explain to their finance team what bitcoin is and how useful it is to the US economy. Wish me luck.
Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger! Feel free to support my endeavors to raise awareness among my states' congressmen. I spend a lot of my free time bugging my representatives on many political subjects!  1DHaks3B21LA2iSeBNEigkcGkWnyL9tcH2

First, congratulations on being a half-millionaire.
Secondly, if you have a wallet, then the best thing to do to "maximize" them is hold onto them. But if you want to spend some of your newfound riches, you should get some kind of bitcoin wallet (which you can Google how to do) and transfer it to USD, or use several of the bitcoin-friendly internet retail stores online.

Several, and a lot of it depends on their response up to that point. There's a lot of good responses to that concern but they, like all communication, will rely heavily on the audience's reception to the answer.

The goal is to talk about crypto in general first, talk about some of the success on foreign soil with altcoins like Ripple. 
The group wants a basic understanding of what bitcoin is and *why* it is the way it is. Rather than get to technical, I'm going to give a nice crash course on the blockchain.
Then I'll dive into economic bonuses of the system being deflationary, money saved by crowsourcing and incentivising transaction calculation, transaction fees for large transfers in banks, and deregulation /decentralization of the currency as a whole (Republicans love deregulation, they eat that shit up). And of course, the huge potential benefit for the people who would push for the U. S. to benefit in bitcoin adoption.
Ultimately I have a lot of knowledge on many facets of crypto and, depending on what they *want* to know, I have the research and knowledge to back it up.
I have a bit of practice at this.

This sub does not allow referral codes.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:41:29
This makes no sense. What do you use as a reference value?

How do you withdraw directly from electrum?
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:58:03
Gosh, your sound reasoning skills are great. You state a bnch of things are incorrect and don't say why. Guess what that makes me, a person who doesn't understand, think of your argument?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:03:48
Can you explain why? I don't understand what SegWit *is.*
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:33:55
Thank you! This works perfectly and does the same thing I spent a night coding a spreadsheet to do...But far better
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:59:08


It's pretty easy when you have some knowledge of it but aren't sharing.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:16:54
You need to understand that if your entire argument is "ONE SIDE IS THE SMART PEOPLE, THE OTHER SIDE IS THE DUMB PEOPLE" you will *never* convince someone of your side. It basically makes you look like [this.](

I have a non-coinbase wallet to hold my coins. I am asking what exchange/wallet/etc. you use to withdraw USD.

n00b question. What's going on in august?

This is terrible advice!

THAT DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHAT THEY FUCKING ARE.

I bought at $220 and have made many successful transactions since then with research and data analysis.
It is very clear you do no understand how cryptocurrency valuation works.

See there's the issue. This isn't something as simple as "don't step in the shit." To me, there's two buttons, and people re arguing over which one to push, and they both look the same to me.

and you can contact coinbase and exclude any non-business transactions (things from another wallet, mining proceeds, gains)
