Probably between 15 and 20 bucks.

The reason psychopaths target churches and classrooms is because nobody carries a gun there.
Do you think some crazy guy would try and kidnap a little girl if he thought she was packing?
Guns are tools and even children can use them responsibly if taught to do so.  Two hundred years ago children were given rifles at the age of 5.  I have no problem with children purchasing weapons.

Bitcoin is unregulated.  You must do your due diligence before conducting business with a party that has no accountability.  Don't let the government decide who you do business with, just do your research.

It is suspected that the holiday may have postponed some of the market movers activity.

This is big step forward for bitcoin.  There are actually properties being listed as well.  Kudos.

Being verified is not necessary.  It all depends on how much money you would like to move at a time. 
I think the verification is just so that they can report your cash moving above a certain level.  Some anti-laundering law, I might be wrong though.

America is following a similar path of Nazi Germany before WWII.  They target Jews and gays much like we are targeting terrorists.  This is a way to create a sense of uncertainty to your fellow citizens, making it much easier to look the other way when they get black bagged.
SOPA, patriot act, and lobbying are all tall tell signs of a takeover.

Price is on the rise.  They could have bailed, but their longevity does suggest that it will return to normal business soon.

I think that his prediction is a bit optimistic.  The average taken during his extrapolation includes the hype spike, which is not indicative of future gains.
I follow the bitcoin religiously and believe that $15-$20 is more reasonable based on the Elliot Wave Analysis.

One small step for man.  One giant leap for bitcoin.

Bitcoin itself is a business in my eye.  Just as banks are a business.  Bitcoin can be used as an investment, a store of value, or a medium of exchange.  Other businesses can be used in conjuncture with bitcoin and will only reinforce the viable uses of bitcoin related services.
The beauty of bitcoin is no matter how you put money into the economy.  It will improve the resilience and efficiency of the currency.

At this point in time, the exchanges are the best way to do it if you cannot find someone locally that sells them.

They will be executed in the order that they can be executed.  So it the price goes down and you have buy orders, the highest priced buy orders will be executed first.  Do not place buy orders above the current price or they will be executed immediately.  Same goes for the sell order side.

Bad businesses can be reported to the bitcoin better business bureau.

That is a very valid point.  I am working on that today.  I wanted to make sure all of the functionality was ironed out.
You can expect a FAQ and info section shortly.
I admit, I should have typed something out before posting this link.
Thank you for your interest.

I have made a short guide on the main site.  I will elaborate over time, but this should suffice for now.
Thanks again for the suggestion.  Keep them coming...
