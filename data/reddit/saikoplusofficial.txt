*ugh Coinbase...
I'd like to see how they plan get around the current
security Issues, network Issues and coin loss with users.
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response. I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites, very disappointed.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:39:48
It's never too late to buy bitcoins.
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:54:24
Well, If you're going for a hardware wallet, then that is definitely better.
I apologize as I have might have been too comfortable with Trezor to look for a faster one.
It's good that you're looking into this, It was a mistake of mine to keep my coins that I don't trade
at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:11:10
Escrow and Customer Service, these are the things that
should be looked at when buying or trading for bitcoins.
Those are the things I loved about Paxful.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:26:57
Try Paxful.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They have an admin mandated tutorial group and lots of references to guide you with regards to trading in which can also be applied to other platforms.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:17:53
Almost everyone is experiencing this.
I trade and buy bitcoins at Paxful and the fees are getting steeper.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:34:41
I'd like to see how coinbase plans get around the current
security Issues, network Issues and coin loss with users.
I hope they Improve their customer relations as well.
I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites due to countless Issues.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:50:48
I remember my first Bitcoin bought at Paxful, I was Instantly hooked.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:08:09
I'm glad I trusted what the people at Paxful told me to keep buying MOAR!!
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:19:10
Coinbase has a history of misgivings these past months and I'd steer clear from it If I were you.
Lost about half a bitcoin last May and I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response.
I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites due to this.

Mycelium is okay, I used to store profits from my Paxful account in there but now I use Trezor.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:54:38
are you "Almost everyone"?
But sure
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:06:04
I Invest about 10-20% of my Income in buying Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:57:18
and because I mention Paxful, I'm already a paid shill? LOL!
Giving an anecdotal example = Paid Shill
So every person here that is saying coinbase is good and mentions it as often as I am and vice versa is a paid shill.
Good job detective, take me to jail
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:00:02
Well, I consider not surrendering any kind of document, anonymous.(Maybe I'm just a simpleton).
I have yet to surrender any kind when I transact and trade on Paxful.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:01:24
If you're into trading, try Paxful.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.

I prefer Trezor to store my earnings from Paxful but I've used electrum before.
It's all good, like the other guys said, just make sure source is legit.
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:02:56
Try Paxful, they have lots of payment options Including credit cards.

@_date: 2017-09-14 21:37:37
It's up to you.
As for me, bought another 0.23 BTC this month from Paxful
which of course, I'll be hodling.

I buy anonymously at darknet or Paxful.

I bought Bitcoins using Paypal with Paxful before.
A bit tedious than other payment options but works.
Just get the best vendor and read his conditions.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:25:09
Have been using Trezor to store my earned BTC from Paxful, so far, I have no qualms.
Such a good wallet.

Buy or Trade.
Back in 2016 I had been pondering mining but ended up buying BTC at Paxful.
Wish I discovered Bitcoins sooner though.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:31:00
A pack of horeshit.
They've been at early as BTC was in the limelight.
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:37:51
Try Paxful, they have LOTS of Payment options to choose from.
Maybe one of them could work for you.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:33:17
Depends, if you're try it out and you are going to buy small amounts, try Paxful.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:03:04
This is good news. I miss my chinese trading friends at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:12:01
Yup. Always keep your coins inside your own wallet.
I keep all BTC that I buy from Paxful to my Trezor wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:55:18
*ugh coinbase.
You should keep contacting support, keep at it.
Now If you're dissatisfied, just wait it out then GTFO.
That's what I did with coinbase(I'm sure you did as well) pulled that stunt on me. I waited for 6 days only to get an automated response.
I've ran back to dNet and Paxful after they restored my coins and the network became stable-ish.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:41:31
Lots of notorious scammers at LBC, like Deepak Chawla, the scourge of Localbitcoins that should be permanently banned.
I'm moved to other sites because of this. Paxful to name a few.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:41:30
hodling is easy.
I just keep stacking/buying BTC from Paxful and hide it like acorns and look away.

@_date: 2017-05-31 19:31:07
That's why I don't bet lol
I don't like risks :P
I just trade on paxful.com.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:28:12
And run somewhere else. Anywhere is better than coinbase.
I took my shit to Paxful and other sites, at least they respond within the hour with
all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:26:55
Which is why I don't gamble and I am very paranoid with bitcoin betting.
I just trade on paxful.com for my bitcoins and I never get scammed like that.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:17:27
Always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which respectable marketplaces like Paxful has.
I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:08:19
After the coinbase fiasco with Ross.
I never trusted anything that coinbase says and does.
I took my shit to Paxful and other dnet sites, 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:15:48
If you're dissatisfied, just wait it out then GTFO.
That's what I did when coinbase pulled that stunt on me.

@_date: 2017-07-05 20:09:44
Checking Bitpay earlier but caught wind of this.
I was hoping to add another trading site besides Paxful and 2 other sites I trade in.
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:24:32
Checked it out and it's a blank page.
Thought it might be a new trading grounds.
Oh well, this might be a sign that I should stay with Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:01:19
Left this behind me a month ago.
Not trusting coinbase/gdax ever again.
For the record coinbase/Gdax was great.....WAS!
However, I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response and them being down again and again whilst I'm buying.
I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites due to this Issue.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:32:23
Never trusted a site or seller that acts like a bank.
That's why I ran away from coinbase and went back to dNet and Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:50:16
Paxful has a separate 2FA and Password.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:55:21
I'm still buying bitcoin at Paxful and 2 dnet sites as well.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:26:54
Mycellium is okay but I'd suggest that you get your own personal wallet which has private keys or turn to paper wallets.
That's what I do when I purchase bitcoins via Paxful.
I don't like leaving it on an online wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:47:42
Nope, Isn't a scam but I am a very Impatient person.
I want my childre....I mean bitcoins Immediately In front of me after I purchase which is why I opted for exchanges like Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:01:50
With the way things are handled now,
It'll be a cold day in hell before I transfer back from Paxful and my other trading grounds.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:11:37
I have been trading on Paxful for several months now and have never surrendered any ID so far.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:26:47
I keep it separate.
Half of my salary goes to Life savings and a small amount to spend on Paxful and my other trading sites.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:58:23
I'd like to see how coinbase plans get around the current

But no worries, I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:37:18
Yikes, talk about horror stories.
Was checking them out earlier hoping I could make one of my trading grounds like Paxful and 2 other sites.
3-5 days of unresponsive CS is a no-no for me.

Coinbase was great.....WAS!
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response when i was worried sick that my Bitcoins disappeared.
I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted (dNet)sites and will continue to find other good trading grounds.
No one deserves the stunts they pull.

Paxful does paypal purchases, a bit of a troublesome process since Paypal is the nemesis of cryptocurrency.

A good analysis but I've never paid attention to all those hoopla when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
It's never too late to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:47:27
Yeah, I'm planning to move my Bitcoins that I bought from Paxful to a Paper Wallet. They said It's safer than a wallet with private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:36:57
Yup, Paxful definitely.
Been trading, buying and selling for approximately 9 months
and I've never had to turn any ID.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:43:25
Well, some people have a bad habit of "TLDR".
Like when I was sharing my experience with Paxful, my friends just cut me off and said "Where would I get $2500?"
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:00:47
Well, I've sold some of bitcoins before for real items...kinda.
I sold some of bitcoins for $100 worth of Amazon gift cards on Paxful, loaded them to my account, then bought speakers, gaming mouse and keyboard sets.

Never leave your bitcoins inside an online wallet, especially GDAX's and Coinbase's, you will get poleaxed.
That's what I do after I transact at Paxful. I send them Immediately to my personal wallet
where I have my private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:41:13
Umm nope!
I have seen traders from those areas in Paxful.
You cray cray.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:02:56
I have come to terms with this and just keep on Hodling.
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla

No worries, Sadly, I am a one trick pony and I get stubborn when I get comfortable with a site and Paxful is the only site I can really recommend.

Also, If you have a Facebook they have a tutorial on how to sell/buy in their platform.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:16:10
LOL bubble.
Anyways, pay no heed to the jeers. I for one never did when i bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:49:54
I separated my BTC on my personal wallet, on Paxful and 2 other exchange sites because I might need to trade them at any time and I don't like waiting for my transfer to complete.
2FA is a good solution whether you're coins are on an Exchange or on your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:55:36
 A gleaming BSOD "Service Unavailable" will greet you
and when you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days!
Wow! Run and don't look back.
I took my shit to Paxful and other sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:20:56
Coinmama is a such a silly name that It seems shady.

That's why I trade at P2P marketplaces like Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:22:39
Well, I always look at customer support and a month ago they had security Issues and network Issues.
I contacted them and they replied to me with an automated response.................after 6 days.
I do not like that all..
Wen't to dNet,Paxful and other marketplaces after that happened.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:54:07
Reminds me when I first bought my bitcoins at Paxful several months ago.
That price *drool

As long as it takes, they have you on chokehold right now, If you need to bugger them, bugger them everywhere.

I can't say the same for coinbase though.
I'd like to see how they plan get around the current

I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted dNet sites.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:02:28
Buying bitcoins was the best Investment I made and I am bad at these things.
I bought my first bitcoin 9 months ago at Paxful and then  grew to several.
When its value grew to above $1000 dollars, I know I did the right thing.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:31:15
AFAIK, most Paxful vendors do not require an ID.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:28:56
Hadn't bought any cheap coins lately unlike several months ago at Paxful LOL.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:50:39
Well, it depends on the platform.
I.E: I use Paxful to sell some of my bitcoins for a bigger rate because I have +29 positive feedback.
You can exchange them for gift cards or bank transfers, whatever is better for you. In any case Paxful has 300 payment options and you get to dictate the terms.
Here's their guides:
Also, If you have a Facebook they have a tutorial on how to sell/buy in their platform.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:46:18
Good thing this hasn't happened to Paxful and 2 other sites that I trade in.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:04:42
Yeah, don't keep your coins in an online wallet especially coinbase's.
I send my coins that I bought from Paxful towards my wallet that has my own private keys.
Planning to make it paper wallet though.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:29:31
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla

It's never too late to buy bitcoins.
I've never paid attention to all these commotions
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:14:28
Anything is better than those lapdogs.
I transferred to 3 different places, one of them is Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:00:00
Well, they're arrogant enough to bank on how people stick to what's comfortable and familiar.
I, for one, cannot tolerate this kind of attitude towards users.
When coinbase did this, I took my shit to dNet, Paxful and other marketplaces.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:45:50
Try Paxful, they have lots of payment options(More than 300 I think).
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:13:11
Have traded on Paxful using Paypal.
It Involves a bit of a long process. I opted out of it because It consumes 10-15 mins(You and vendor will get to know each other) of verification sending Invoices etc. but it works.
But of course proceed with caution, you are correct though, Paypal is an enemy of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:27:04
You will get a better value when you sell at Paxful and
dictate the payment option you prefer.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:58:47
This is just me, but I never did consider any kind of news, I just kept buying on buying after my first purchase at Paxful.
But to give you a logical advice, try again in August.
Rumors saying that there will be some changes at that time. Speculations at this point but  I have always considered speculations as long as It's not on the Tinfoil hat level.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:42:00
They gave me a used card. And I didn't find them, I just go about my day and trade. Somehow, they encounter me lol.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:28:10
Hope you don't experience a gleaming BSOD "Service Unavailable". 
When you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days.....With an automated response!
Got fed up and I took my shit to Paxful and other dNet sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:16:05
LOL! Good luck with that Indeed.
But antics aside:
It's never too late to buy bitcoins.
I've never paid attention to all these hoopla
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:53:44
I've been trading, buying and selling bitcoins on Paxful for quite some time now
and I have yet to surrender any kind of Identification.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:12:46
Well, I buy and sell on dNet and they vary; 1%, 2%- 4%. What's constant is Paxful, just 1% per transaction.
I don't really mind the transaction fee as long at It's quick and not a scam.
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:11:32
AFAIK Paxful supports some Bank Wires. You should check them out.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:16:27
Banks won't go away, they never did. This is an old speculation. I've never paid attention to all those hoopla
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:26:57
The fork will come but rather than hesitating to buy, I buy mine monthly.
Small amounts through P2P marketplaces like Paxful until I get to 1 whole BTC.
Slowly but surely.
Nothing good will come from worrying. Just buy and hope for the best  ;D
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:32:17
If this is true, then all my hard work trading carefully at Paxful will be rewarded, yay!
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:54:41
I buy bitcoins on Paxful and I have yet to surrender any kind of Identification.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:46:02
Yay! For the newbs!
It's never too late to buy bitcoins.
Just make to read the guides and you'll be fine.
I've never paid too much attention to all the negativity
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:46:54
Escrow and Customer Service, these are the things that
should be looked at when buying or trading for bitcoins.
Those are the things I loved about Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:57:17
Bookmarked, good job.
I read and consult mostly with Paxful's guide and apply it to my other trading sites. Wish this was available when I started buying.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:38:32
Try Paxful, it has more than 300 payment options to choose from.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:54:10
Try Paxful, I don't buy with Paypal but AFAIK, some users accept Paypal as payment.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:31:52
Any financial Institution/Company who works like a government lapdog IS A BANK!
Left that place for Dnet and Paxful.
Surprisingly, I feel less screwed.
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:46:19
Where I trade(Paxful), they only charge 1% per transaction and 0.0008 BTC miner's fee.
0.14 gives me a headache.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:16:48
Yoda might be a good explanation why I hodl'd after my 3rd purchase with Paxful.
Hodl you must!
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:06:08
Try Paxful, they have some options that have lower price trades and charges only 1% per transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:12:44
You'll get Poleaxed at coinbase.
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response. I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:55:07
If you're dissatisfied, just wait it out then GTFO.
That's what I did when coinbase pulled that stunt on me.
I waited for 6 days only to get an automated response.
I've ran back to dNet and Paxful after they restored my coins and the network
became stable-ish.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:38:47

I will continue on buying and trading on Paxful and dnet for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:19:43
Coinbase has become awful. I'd like to see how they plans to get around the current security Issues, network Issues and coin loss with users.
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response.
But no worries, I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted (dnet) sites.
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:44:40
I have some nigerian friends that trade on Paxful.
Familiar with what they use but in any case Paxful provided a guide for it:
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:30:22
I'm paranoid and I like buying anonymously which is why I user services like Paxful and other sites that supports anonymous trading/purchase.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:15:47
 A gleaming BSOD "Service Unavailable" will greet you
and when you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days!
Wow! Run and don't look back.
I took my shit to Paxful and other sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:31:14
I bought more bitcoins at Paxful and plan to buy more in the coming week.
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:18:31
If you're dissatisfied, just wait it out then GTFO.
That's what I did when coinbase was fumbling.
I waited for 6 days only to get an automated response.

Never paid much attention to these when I first bought bitcoin at Paxful but good read.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:42:41
When I got to my third bitcoin via Paxful, didn't realize I was HODLing. I don't even know why I'm hodling, maybe because I had the privilege of buying several months ago.
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:30:38
Just stay away from coinbase whether large or small purchases.
The "Service Unavailable" will greet you 2-3x daily.
and when you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days!
I was trading in coinbase before but
I took my shit to Paxful and other sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:31:33
If that's how you feel then go for it. Monitor it closely.
You won't be judged if you don't buy like a crazy person like me.
Maybe I just got addicted to trading at Paxful because I rarely get the trading biz down pat.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:33:21
Gold sucks!
I've never paid attention to all the buzz about gold.
I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful and It was a far better Investment than gold.

@_date: 2017-07-07 10:06:48
Poor ross, poleaxed by Coinbase.
Good thing I GTFO and transferred to my bitcoins to dnet, Paxful and my own wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:20:21
So that's why some rates fell down at Paxful.
Just bought $200 worth.
I think I might just wait for a while before buying again.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:12:35
Wait it out and update us.
One of my few trading grounds, Paxful doesn't need ID verification. You can check them out once this fiasco is over.
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:57:49
I won't say this for anyone else but me; I hate services that has terrible customer service.
Any kind of platform is bound to fumble at some point Including Paxful and CS are the ones who can help prevent the fumbling to spread.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:40:52
If you're so sure that they're not secure then GTFO.
That's what I did when coinbase had some Issues. I ran towards 2 dnet sites and Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:33:35
Don't pay attention to all these hoopla
I didn't when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
Buy then Hodl, repeat!
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:42:52
LOL! When I first bought at Paxful several months ago, they were also saying these type of things.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:48:56
Tried Bitstamp earlier this week. Didn't go well with CS.
Transferred back to Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:30:50
I never paid attention to the price anyways.
I bought my first bitcoin at Paxful, closed my eyes to the jeers and HODL'd
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:03:35
I can pretty much do this on Paxful. All I do is sell my Bitcoins for Amazon Gift Cards and load it to my account and the rest is history. 
I bought my speakers, keyboards and mouse with this method.
Here's their tutorial group (direct from their admin) If you're Interested: 
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:04:40
I transferred my coins from coinbase to Paxful &amp; other sites because of the almost frequent network Issues they're having lately.
And when you do ask for assistance, they'll respond in 6-7 days....with a canned response.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:46:30
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla

Try Paxful.
I've been trading, buying and selling bitcoins there for quite some time now and I have yet to surrender any kind of Identification.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They have guides on how to buy bitcoin as well:
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:55:22
Well, AFAIK, Paxful's prepaid credit/debit card is on it's way. And yes, I would use it!

Just make sure to get your bitcoins to a personal wallet or paper wallet before that date comes.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:18:58

Saw this post before and I'll say it again:
When I first bought at Paxful several months ago, they were also saying these type of things. Hogwash
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:44:45
Where I trade(Paxful), It's only 1% per transaction and 0.0008 BTC miner's fee.
5% and up will kill you.

After my 3rd bitcoin purchase at Paxful, I treat my bitcoins like my own children lol, IDK why!
No one's gonna pull an R.Kelly on them! LOL

 All I do is sell my Bitcoins for Amazon Gift Cards on Paxful and load it to my account and the rest is history.

Ah! The equally Shitty GDAX strikes again.
This is their version of coinbase's BSOD "Service Unavailable".
Run away, Take your coins to other sites.
I took my shit to Paxful and other sites, at least they respond within the hour with
all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:29:32
You can try selling it in Paxful.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They have LOTS of guides on how to buy bitcoin as well:
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:55:06
I store the profits that I make from trading at Paxful on a personal wallet.
I only leave a few amount of coins at sites.

I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites due to this.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:13:07
Never leave your bitcoins inside an online wallet, especially GDAX's and Coinbase's,
you will get poleaxed.
That's what I do after I transact at Paxful. I send them Immediately to my personal wallet
where I have my private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:33:45
Well, Mycellium is at "Meh" level, tolerable at the very least.
Agreed on bitstamp as well which is why I'm back on Paxful and deepweb/darknet(Try at your own risk).
If you're going to try Paxful, read up on their knowledgebase and get some tips inside their admin supported Facebook groups:
Here's the video tutorials as well:
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:12:24
Coinbase are now lapdogs, oh well, I got out of that place and divided my coins to Paxful and other sites.
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:59:57
Fast? I buy bitcoins on Paxful and they're already fast.
Will Checking them out. might be a potential new trading grounds.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:52:35

@_date: 2017-07-06 13:07:52
It's okay to be skeptical, In fact, what you are doing is rational and logical.
What I know is that Paxful's support team is solid.
Customer service is Important to me because I don't wanna be left out the dark whenever I am trading or have encountered a problem.
And also, I can see how much effort they are putting in versus the normal marketplace.
You can even tweet them:
Coinbase for the record was great.....WAS!
But the excuse that there was a burst of new users is not an excuse for neglecting users who are experiencing problems. If they have new clients then hire more support people ASAP.
They shouldn't be in this line of business if the best excuse they have is that they didn't expect is....C'MON, you are coinbase FFS.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:59:58
This might be another addition to my trading sites.
I always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which respectable marketplaces like Paxful has.
I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:07:03
For the record, coinbase was good.....WAS!
I'll observe for now but I highly doubt that they'll change Immediately.
Good thing I've transferred to Paxful and other sites.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:36:41
Wait it out!
If you're dissatisfied by this, then GTFO after they reply or fix your situation.
That's what I did when coinbase pulled that stunt on me.

@_date: 2017-06-30 06:35:45
Aside from countless Issues they're having right now(Security Issues), Coinbase is meddling scum. 
Working with the gooberman, what a turnoff.
Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:46:01
Friend Introduced me to lots of marketplaces and there are plenty of good places but the thing caught my eye was Paxful since they had In-house guides and that got me started quite well.
But to each his own, wherever you are comfortable.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:59:42
Meh, I opted out of Coinmama, the name was fishy enough.
I trade and buy my BTC on Paxful.com
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:03:47
Security Issues here, Privacy Issues there and service Issues galore.
That's what got me running back to Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:04:16
Something similar like this happened to me with an Amazon gift card when I just started trading. I opened a dispute right on the trade window, an admin stepped in, saw what had happened, and awarded me the bitcoin and banned the scammers account. Justice was served lol!  I have been trading on Paxful ever since.
In any case, their moderators and admins are on 24/7, they can help you out with this case.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:26:05
Was told it was a cat sleeping on a keyboard.
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:39:08
High reputation vendors tend to charge more since they are fast. I have sold gift cards with some of them so, I can vouch for the fast transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-30 05:56:07
Whatever works for you man. There are lots of other good sites, whichever goes for you.
I now use at least 3 sites and Paxful is one of them.
I'm in it for the responsive support team, guides and escrow.
Also, if you will go to P2P marketplaces, be sure to read their guides and this is just me but I'm alway paranoid no matter what so I video every single transaction.
Tedious? yes. Do I feel safer that way, yes. LOL
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:35:51
I don't know the status of coinbase right now tbh but last week, when we felt the Issues, the ross case and the countless testimonials.
We waited for it to stabilize, then transferred it Immediately. Hodl and hoped that nothing bad happens within the duration of the transfer.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:56:01
I bought my first bitcoin at Paxful...tried to forget about it.....then bought another and another and another.
And then there were 6 lol
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:14:25
I've had my 2fa removed twice and the longest I had to wait with Paxful was 5 hours. Guess I'm lucky.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:47:54
Me before: Bitcoin sounds like a scam, F that sh*t
Me Now: OH GAHD WHY DIDN'T I KNOW OF THIS!
But seriously speaking, when I first bought bitcoin via Paxful, I was still hesitant and now, I have 6+ coins, probably the best Investment I made.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:35:34
LOL yeah!
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:14:44
Last time I was trading at coinbase,  a gleaming BSOD "Service Unavailable" will greet you and when you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days!
Wait it out! Once you get your coins, run and don't look back.
I took my shit to Paxful and other sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:50:23
After me and my friend took our bitcoins from coinbase to Paxful, we were currently looking at GDAX then this.
I guess, we really will stay on Paxful for good until it all settles down.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:33:54
I buy and trade for bitcoins at Paxful.
They have lots of payment options that you can use.
There are lots of payment options in there that doesn't require you to submit an ID.
I urge you to read up on their policies and FAQ's, then try them out for yourself.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:25:53
Seems shady.

and/or if said platform supports Escrow

I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:25:54
I keep them at my personal wallet in my desktop, at Paxful and at 2 other sites.
I keep half at Paxful because I buy Amazon gift cards to turn into anything I need from there.
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:01:12
Don't just keep hodling!!
For the record I still buy small amounts of BTC on Paxful and tbh these news are stressing me out.
But the more I get stressed, the more I wanna buy Bitcoins. LOL Sadlyf.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:45:08
I keep my coins at my desktop wallet, Paxful(for buying gift cards) and 2 other places.
But yeah, there is not one single super safe wallet.
Agreed to get 2FA for all your wallets/accounts.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:05:25
Fees are the least of your problems.
Considering the amount of f-ups they've accumulated in the  span of 6 months.
Better of trading in other legit places like Paxful or other sites.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:28:09
That's right!
Trade somewhere else! Aside from countless Issues they're having right now(Security Issues), Coinbase is meddling scum.

Well, not exactly what happened to me but I have to say that when I first bought bitcoins at Paxful was skeptical.
Then I bought another that led to another and now I see that It has all paid off.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:22:11
Trade somewhere else! Coinbase is meddling scum with zero accountability and their support is a cat sleeping on the keyboard!
Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:35:22
that's fucking hilarious!
Some of you guys think that 6 days of non-response is okay or they're just busy!
Me:Hey my account is being hacked!
Them:We're busy, we can't protect you! It's probably your fault.
Coibase was good, but not presently.
And for the record, Paxful replies within the and sometimes almost within minutes.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:31:46
I buy bitcoin monthly at Paxful.
I make sure at least 1/4 of my monthly income goes to BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:29:50
Seems shady.
Always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which respectable marketplaces like Paxful has.
I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:21:24
Better off transferring your bitcoins in a better place and withdraw somewhere faster.
I buy bitcoins from Paxful and I transfer it to a local bitcoin remittance app. I get my money within 24 hours or less.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:00:20
Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent.
So aside from security Issues of coinbase, they can potentially meddle in your affairs.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:17:18
After my 3rd BTC bought at Paxful. I stopped asking that question but the only difference is that the money I am Investing isn't that large and what I Invested in isn't my life savings but excess.
I keep a separate life savings.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:45:28
I like Paxful best due to the .0008 miner's fee.
I don't percentage because sometimes I buy big amounts.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:08:17
Get a better place other than coinbase.
Coinbase is meddling scum and assholes.
Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent.
Bitcoin is freedom
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:49:12
When i first bought BTC at Paxful, 9 months ago, I was hoping it's price would go up(It did.) and will continue to do so but not this much.
I'm cray cray but not that cray cray
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:51:31
I second this!
I trade at Paxful &amp; some sites at dNet but I  recently use paper wallet. Wish I had known this earlier.
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:00:01
Not legitimate? 
I buy Bitcoins and trade on Paxful and have bought Amazon Gcs before.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They have guides on how to buy bitcoin as well:
What kind of Illegitimate platform has provides navigation guides and tips for trading well.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:32:23
I dunno about you but I enjoy lower fees like Paxful has.
0.0008 BTC for miner's fee &amp; 1% per transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:42:17
I buy Bitcoins and trade on Paxful.com
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They have guides on how to buy bitcoin as well:
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:57:40
Let's put it this way, whatever works out for you.
Some people even reported being scammed by people in front of them.
As for me, I like P2P(I use Paxful to buy bitcoins) solely because I am comfortable with the system.
So, yeah, whatever you want.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:30:24
After my first purchase at Paxful, I buy bitcoins on a monthly basis, even now.
I just buy and HODL(Hold on for dear life) LOL!
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:42:44
Yeah, but I caught 2x scammers up to date. And sometimes I wish they were out to scam me so that I can have more bitcoins.
Is bitcoin twisting my mind? LOL
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:44:08
They're fucking wankers.
Me and my mate did a joint account with them, suddenly, 0 balance.
Messaged them, they said they're experiencing high trading volume that's why it's screwy.
Why are you in the trading business in the first place If you cannot even anticipate the possibility of that happening?
After a while balance came back, network became stable-ish, afterwards, we transferred back to Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:28:15
Hoping you can get out with your BTCs.
I guess me and my friend got lucky and got out last week.
We're now safe and sound at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:20:43
Still spewing the same conspiracy theory lol!
You can't even bring forward a coherent evidence.
Not a single one against Paxful.
WHERE did I mention that It is safer?
WHERE? Now you're Inserting words in my mouth?
I, only me, I feel safe at Paxful because they have resolved my disputes before. They can speak for themselves.
You were the one who started Lambasting Paxful. In any case they can follow your shit-trail here getting all defensive and twitchy.
Again, bring some evidence forward or better yet file a criminal case if you're so sure.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:41:17
I'd like to know what are the rates of fees are because I mostly buy in bulk with Paxful and they only charge .0008 BTC(More or less $2).
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:27:53
 A gleaming BSOD "Service Unavailable" will greet you
and when you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days!
Run and don't look back.
I took my shit to Paxful and some other sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:55:07
Yeah, that's right move out and don't look back!
Anything else is better than this.
Support is non-existent and accountability is shot.
I've gone back to my fallback site, Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:17:43
After my 6th purchase of bitcoin at Paxful....yes HODL...!
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:24:39
P2P marketplaces are pretty okay actually.
Paxful or any place equivalents is fine.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:40:02
//Protect your accounts. Personal responsibility. Quit whining like a punished child.//
Yup, you should be more responsible.
However, LBC has been below par lately, wonder what's happening there.
Hope it doesn't happen to Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:53:45
Well, if the price to pay is safety and Escrow.
I'd gladly pay the Paxful miner's fee to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:16:12
Me and my mate already abandoned that dump and he migrated to Paxful when things went full-on screwy last week.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:25:07
Try P2P marketplaces like Paxful.
I buy Bitcoins and trade there.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:32:17
I bought 4-5 bitcoins less at approximately $700 a piece earlier this year at Paxful.
Am I rich AF?
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:35:25
Thank you for giving my HODLing sense.
After I bought my 2nd Bitcoin with Paxful, I literally stopped asking questions to myself XD
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:03:19
carry on then:D
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:30:20
Some of the guys said that this guys from bitquick/bitquik?
I dunno but regardless, yes real chill dudes those Paxful guys.
They even launched an Admin mandated tutorial group on FB:
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:50:06
Umm yeah about that article.
Here's the continuation.
Digest your local media with a grain of salt, always.
And here's the Paxful CEO doing your "Shady" shit:
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:50:11
Stopped asking that question after my 2nd bitcoin purchase at Paxful.
HODL is life.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:28:33
Source? Where? Anecdotal? Hearsay?
Lots of baseless rumors float around like how Paxful isn't banning scammers, they are mostly siding with vendors.
What is it really? Such convenient BS you subscribe to.
If Paxful is a backalley, I don't know what LBC is:
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:44:48
For an online company that has "quick" in its name, It isn't.
I was with a friend at that time and he bought BTC there and it arrived 6-7 hours. By that time my friend was all paranoid and twitchy.
We vowed to stay in Paxful and never migrate again, lol
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:24:07
Trade somewhere else! Aside from countless Issues they're having right now(Security Issues), Coinbase is meddling scum. 
Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent.

Here's one of the latest news:
How to get poleaxed by coinbase.
Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent. Bitcoin is freedom
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:25:58
LOL! You can! There are lots of services that sell small portions of a bitcoin. Paxful to name a few.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:49:46
I always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which respectable marketplaces like Paxful.
I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:22:16
Yet another victim again. Effin coinbase.
Me and my friend encountered this and we were lucky enough to be able to transfer our bitcoins to Paxful last week.
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:42:11
Didn't something like this was said before? And now we are staring at bigger value of BTC.
I stopped thinking about those after my first purchase of bitcoins at Paxful and other sites.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:44:32
Have no Idea but I got my speakers, keyboard and mouse
at amazon by trading my Bitcoins for amazon gift cards at Paxful
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:54:49
I feel for you coin brother. Just wait it out.
I had a similar encounter with coinbase.
Waited 2 week give or take. When the network become stable-ish, transferred out and spread it out on my personal wallet, Paxful and the 2 other trading sites(2 Dnet sites).
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:46:49
Run and don't look back.
After the network fiascos, got fed up and I took my shit to Paxful and other sites.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:01:42
Paxful.com has escrow and 24/7 Moderators.
They can guide you step by step.
I know it's scary, man. I remember the several months ago when I bought my first BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:23:53
I buy Bitcoins and trade on Paxful.
I saw an option to sell bitcoin to buy Steam Gift Cards.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:43:25
I have been trading lots of Amazon cards on Paxful and never once did I see such edgelord wannabe's like you saying:
"Oh I got scammed out of $100 gift cards, oh well"
*throws card away
*walks towards camera
*card explodes
A similar thing happened to me, I provided screenshots, previous trades, the works and I think I've gotten half of my bitcoins from scammers trying to scam me lol.
Paxful has provided enough support, It's up to us to utilize it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:09:46
I trade on paxful.com almost everyday and I have been scammed before but luckily, the moderators were there to help me out.
I never put my guard down, I watch and ready any tip they give out.
Even talk to support from time to time.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:38:09
 A gleaming BSOD "Service Unavailable" will greet you
and when you contact coinbase they'll respond in 6-7 days!
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response.
But no worries, I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:31:47
I asked them 2 weeks ago and said it's because of high trading volume which is bullshit.
Why are you in the trading business in the first place If you cannot even anticipate the possibility of that happening?
I have made my fair share of arguments with Customer Support like when I confronted Paxful.
They admitted oversight, promised to fix it and none of that bullcrap.
Accountability matters.

Damn you bald guy!
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:18:07
IDK LEALANA BITCOINS as well.
But what i can see is no Escrow and no accountability
Just buy in proper P2P marketplaces like Paxful. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:12:57
Well, I'm actually spending some of my bitcoins because I need some things.
I recently bought 3 pcs of $25 Amazon giftcards at Paxful and bought new speakers, gaming keyboards and mouse.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:00:16
I sell bitcoins for Amazon gift cards over on Paxful.
I saw a posting 3 days ago about Amazon France gift cards.
I didn't pay much attention but you should check Paxful from time to time.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:24:52
Beat me to it.
Paxful is one the fastest way to acquire bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:16:16
I got scammed as well and something similar like this happened to me with an Amazon gift card when I just started trading. I opened a dispute right on the trade window, an admin stepped in, saw what had happened, and awarded me the bitcoin and banned the scammers account. Justice was served lol!  I have been trading on Paxful ever since 
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:11:48
I always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which Paxful has.
Does it have that?
But yeah, coinbase is shit
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:01:05
I'll never buy or transact at coinbase.
I'll stick with Paxful or anything equivalent, at least they don't meddle with my account.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:23:00
Suggestion as a successful trader on Paxful.
Don't panic and do what they said.
A common rookie mistake that they see moderators/support as Batman or superheroes who strike fear into the heart of evil people.
Again, do what Paxful mods are telling you, go through the process and when It doesn't work, you can ask them for more solutions Instead of ranting.
Ranting is good but doesn't give back what you lost.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:03:09
I'd like to see how coinbase plans get around the current
security Issues, network Issues and coin loss with users.
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response.
But no worries, I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:02:56
I've never stopped buying bitcoins at Paxful.
And as scary as the boogeyman stories of the media, my urge to buy as much as I can prevails lol.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:26:09
People should forget their nostalgia, just create a nostalgia video and wave goodbye to coinbase.
They're shit now.
I was recommended to go there from Paxful but boooy was I wrong.
The longest that I had to wait with Paxful CS was 2 hours and I was furious and Coinbase CS was like: 
6 days of pure paranoia and terror!
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:03:36
Going outside? Gasp!
I'll just buy bitcoins at Paxful, thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:01:01

@_date: 2017-06-23 10:58:07
Gemini is good IMO.
Actually, anything is better than coinbase.
I've actually made a mistake that coinbase is better than Paxful but experiencing their CS versus Pax's is like night and day.
6 days of no response is killing me. F coinbase in the ass!
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:07:47
We have the interwebz bro not restricted to geography.
However when you buy bitcoin on the Internet,
always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which respectable marketplaces like Paxful has.
I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:10:45
Gift cards are a go at Paxful
Bought a few Amazon gift cards myself and voila, Creative speakers. lol
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:14:09
After my 6th BTC bought at Paxful.
I have closed my ears to any negative feedback....
I still buy BTC in small amounts up to this day LOL
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:26:48
Try Paxful,
1% trading fee and .0008 Miner's fee.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They provide ample guides as well.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:54:02
I have transacted with a couple of Nigerian fellas before
at Paxful.
And I see lots of them trade there as well.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:23:19
I purchase around that much on bitcoins on Paxful.
Just 1% per purchase then 0.0008 miner's fee when transferring out.
So I get $2.50 out of $50.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:42:49
Meh It's okay, its layer and layers and layers ;)
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:11:51
Wow! Run and don't look back.
I took my shit to Paxful and my other trading sites, at least they respond within the hour with all the information you want.
They don't even Invest in a good support team.
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:08:49
This is too complex and predictions can go either way.
While waiting I buy small amounts of BTC at Paxful.
It's too painful and difficult to process anyways so, on with HODLing! LOL
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:13:39
Good Idea! LOL! You made me hungry! Well played sir!
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:30:11
So basically, no Escrow?
Just so y'now I don't hold any grudges against platforms w/o Escrow
just a preferrence. I like my platform's admins to be more accountable.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:48:13
As a Intermediate buyer of bitcoins over on Paxful.
I buy from my extra money and buy with giftcards.
To give an assurance to Bitcoins sellers, I also Include my receipt that I bought it with cash and it is mine.
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:53:59
Don't delete! Wait it out then gtfo coinbase.
I hope you don't get greeted by an automated response after 6 days like what happened to me.
After you get reinstated, run and don't look back.
Look for other sites.

As one of the victims of coinbase:
Wait it out, then GTFO.
There are lots of places you can buy/sell/trade bitcoins.
I personally use Paxful and 2 other sites.
Whatever works for you.
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:34:48
Had success on Paxful as well.

With dealing with Bitcoins as a whole, you have to read read read.
Paxful has provided me with enough resources that I can trade better.
And with a 24/7 Moderator and Escrow service, I'm not going anywhere else.
I've loved Paxful for these things!

Unfortunately with the way coinbase is going and handling
the Issues with Security, network connectivity as well as Public
relations, we're better off migrating to another site.

and ended up going back to our fallback site, Paxful.

Any legit site should be better than the crap show they're showing lately.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:31:20
Why are they in the Industry in the first place?
Are they that Incompetent?(Rhetorical Question)
We migrated there from Paxful on hopes of better trading but we were dead wrong.
6 days non-response from CS and BSOD saying "Service Unavailable".
And after that terrible experience, we moved back to Paxful.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:15:01
I guess I got lucky but glad that you're account is okay

Everything about BTC and trades around it should be studied and Paxful is no exception.
Here's a their guide to get you started:
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:38:15
I'd recommend that they buy bitcoin on a easy platform like Paxful or anything equivalent.
Here's a guide from them for the newbies:
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:40:26
If you do consider buying BTC,
always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which marketplaces like Paxful has.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:26:05
Meddling scum is meddling scum. 
Coinbase apologists wake up.
Coinbase makes the rest of the online sites look safer.
Trade somewhere else.
I don't know about his buddy but my mate and I went back to Paxful. We don't appreciate that they meddle in user's affair.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:08:06
Well Paxful only charges .0008 miners fee no matter what.
So I guess, Paxful it is.

Thanks for the warning.
I don't like providing ID, etc as well.
Looks like I'm not really migrating out Paxful with all the crap that's happening with countries.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:05:20
On Paxful I buy my gift cards with cash, I document everything just in case something odd happens.
Screenshots, pics, the works. I am dealing something of value, that much I understand.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:24:11
Yikes! I feel for you!
We were lucky enough to be able to transfer ours from coinbase to our Paxful wallet.
Fuck coinbase, anywhere else should be better.

Report! Scammers must die!

Well, I have been on Paxful for several months now.
Got my first bitcoin there.
Was going to LBC but I saw this:
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:48:27
Trade somewhere else! Aside from countless Issues they're having right now(Security Issues), Coinbase is meddling scum. 
Better off trading in good places like Paxful, anything equivalent or any "meh" place.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:54:55
Nevermind the security issue, the worse part is the potential meddling in your affairs.
How to get poleaxed by coinbase.

I honestly don't know and maybe I'm too dumb to understand.
I just hope for the best and keep buying bitcoins at Paxful every month. 
Don't get me wrong, I constantly see these questions coupled with the threat of hard fork but I just shrug it off and try to be positive in amidst of all the questions.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:26:23
I'll have my Indian friends try that.
We trade and buy on Paxful.com by the way.
It has Escrow and a 24/7 moderator/admin prescence.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:52:11
I wasn't really knowledgeable how it all works until someone recommended Paxful and bought my first bitcoin there.
And another, and another. Now, I see the value of my BTC growing, best Investment ever.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:07:50
People should forget their nostalgia, just create a nostalgia video and wave goodbye to coinbase.
They're shit now.
I was recommended to go there from Paxful but boooy was I wrong. 
The longest that I had to wait with Paxful CS was 2 hours and I was furious and Coinbase CS was like:
6 days of pure paranoia and terror!
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:15:33
Yup! I was referred to both Paxful and LBC researched both of them and here's what I saw and scared the crap out of me:
I did get scammed 3x at Paxful but the support team had my back.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:08:13
If you want a trial at buying bitcoins, try to start with small amounts.
I buy bitcoin in small amounts at Paxful with Escrow.
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:10:24
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response.
But no worries, I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:40:37
Gemini is good.
Time to move to anywhere else but coinbase.
I moved back to Paxful, my fallback site.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:17:11
//Lol, you are a paid troll? Figured!//
Really? And what led you to believe that? Your street smarts?
You've been on an all out war against Paxful and traders like me are affected so yeah, I'm here to put a stop to all your bullshit.
// If you don't know that LBC is less shady than Pax, you are lost. Did you ever hear the story of Marcos the admin?Probably not. Lol.//
Sorry but I don't listen to anecdotal woo stories. Show me your proof!
I have only stated what led me away from LBC, so those people posting are just paid trolls right? because LBC is such a safe place.
// Notice the lack of sellers on Pax lately? They're all banned. No reason given.
Yeah, I'm just making stuff up//
Notice the amount of bullshit you are talking about?
And also, bring those people forward here, Imaginary people don't know how to reddit. 
I can say that pirates are the reason there's no global warming.
Notice the lack of pirates? Hence global warming.

Checked prizes in Paxful market and other marketplaces.
Doesn't seem like it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:22:10
No, Seeing that person's face won't do anything, I record every click, every Input, every move made while I'm transacting.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:00:06
Waited 2-3 hours before. Told myself, must be just a bug.
After a month, in comes the scary Issues.
So, back to Paxful for me.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:17:17
Bought my first coin at Paxful, said to myself, I'll try it out first...And now I'm close to having 7 BTC.
Moral of the story, The BTC you have is never enough
*evil laugh
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:38:19
Me as well!
Trade somewhere else! Aside from countless Issues they're having right now(Security Issues).
Their CS sucks! Zero accountability.
Yeah, move back to your fallback sites, anything is better than them. We moved back to Paxful, at least their CS doesn't give us this kind of crap.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:06:28
Should I link the reddit source then? Sure!

I buy Bitcoins and trade on Paxful
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They also created guides on how to buy bitcoin, etc.:
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:35:18
That's how I bought my Creative PC speakers actually.
I buy bitcoins and trade on Paxful.
My old speakers broke down and all I had to do was trade a few Bitcoins, load it up to my account and the rest was history.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:31:51
Unfortunately you should consume material from your local media with a big grain of salt:
I have been trading on Paxful since last year and so far, they've lifted me up to +78 and 6 BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:28:08
It's a strong buy IMO. They'll never stop it.
Bought my first bitcoin several months ago on paxful.com
and now the value has tripled.
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:30:06
I've also moved out of coinbase and moved 3/4 of my coins to my personal wallet and the remaining are with my current trading grounds. Paxful and 3 other sites.
Such a shame coinbase, such a shame.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:30:54
//I've used Paxful numerous, numerous times. Hell I think I have more feedback there than my 17 year old ebay account. Just pick a reputable seller. 99% is nothing to sweat over. They can be picky the first time you buy, and most will limit you on your first 7 days or so - a particular vendor may only let you buy so much before they allow a grace period to pass. Good luck.//
I can vouch for this, my first 7 days of trading was limited.
But Paxful has been good to me over the past several months.
I'm a pretty stubborn person so it may take some time for me to
go and migrate to a new site.

Better off trading in good places like Paxful or anything equivalent. There are lots of other good places.
So aside from security Issues of coinbase, they can potentially meddle in your affairs.

Like I said to the other bloke, that's how I bought my Creative PC speakers.

Have you tried to buy Amazon Gift Cards with Bitcoins in a P2P marketplace like Paxful?
That's how I got my speakers btw.

@_date: 2017-06-22 18:52:10
Whoa really?
I guess I'll transfer my BTC from there back to Paxful first and see what happens. Hope it doesn't pull a coinbase on us.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:21:27
In an event that this happens:
1)Don't panic
2)Prepare all the information for moderators.
3)Re-open trade and press dispute.
4)If other user blocks you, contact moderators via the chat widget/icon on the lower right portion of the page.
5)Provide necessary Information to admins/mods
They have FAQs and youtube tutorials, make use of what you have.
Something similar like this happened to me with an Amazon gift card when I just started trading. I opened a dispute right on the trade window, an admin stepped in, saw what had happened, and awarded me the bitcoin and banned the scammers account. Justice was served lol!  I have been trading on Paxful ever since 
@_date: 2017-06-30 05:52:06
The fork will come but rather than hesitating to buy, I buy mine monthly.
Small amounts through P2P marketplaces like Paxful until I get to 1 whole BTC.Slowly but surely.
Nothing good will come from worrying. Just buy and hope for the best  ;D
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:12:36
Depends on what you wanna buy.
Well, I know that you can buy Amazon gift cards with BTC in Bitcoin Marketplaces like Paxful or anything similar.
Bought Giftcards then bought speakers at Amazon.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:44:10
Paxful has lots of ways to pay though. There might be something else there.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:00:16
Here's a Paxful knowledgebase article about that.
For me .0008 is quite okay rather than other sites that charge %.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:52:41
And this trend will continue!
Trade somewhere else! Aside from countless Issues they're having right now(Security Issues), Coinbase is meddling scum. 
Just go to your Fallback sites or Plan B. I have reverted to using Paxful, at least there's no drama.
