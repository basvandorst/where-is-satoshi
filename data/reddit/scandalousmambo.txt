Both are signatories to the Berne Convention.  Therefore, any U.S. copyright or assignment of copyright would be respected in those countries under identical terms to the United States Copyright Act of  1976.  The same is true if she were a UK or EU citizen in the U.S. 


Same as U.S.C. 17 Section 201.   
One thing that should be pointed out, however, is that no copyright may be transferred, in whole or in part, without a written contract.  
   
If the self-described owner of this app has no such contract, then legally she has no rights to any other party's works.

That is a provably false statement.
If whomever claims to own this app's source code hired someone to produce it under an appropriate agreement, they can name themselves the author of the work under U.S.C. Title 17 Sections 101 and 201.  
Not only does Title 17 give them all the moral rights, but in a federal court of law, they can assert under oath they are the author of the work and both the judge and opposing counsel will have no option whatsoever to do anything but nod and sit quietly.  


I am aware of no obligation the owner of any app has to divulge their legal relationships with contractors.
