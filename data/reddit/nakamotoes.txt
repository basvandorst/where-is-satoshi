At about 0:46 he refers to "cruise missile system" and then says I believe "Aegis" :

I don't see what problem decentralization solves here and it seems like if the healthcare system used it they would have to build a redundant centralized system on top of it because of the threat of theft.  Hackers would have a field day if they got private keys. And then how do you restore your blockchain? oh right better refer to your centralized records. These sorts of things would make it more expensive and more vulnerable to attack imo.

Is your startup idea to create an exchange and steal all the coins and blame it on hackers? That seems to be a popular one

I believe the gov't seized millions of $ from them so that could be part of the problem. Are you sure they have "deposits still rolling in"?
It's difficult to say if Gox is manipulating the market, but it's hard to believe they aren't taking advantage of it.  Too easy with arbitrage since they are known to have traded on their own exchange before.

I'm not sure what to make of this from 2011:

Reason alone to use a twitter wall or a bitcoin wall?

m30b30 over at bitcointalk appears to have found a match. It looks like the logo for Ingersoll Cutting tools.
 
Dorian machined model train parts so this would make sense. 
Thanks for your assistance!

It's very interesting to think about although imo I just can't see any bias that is introduced by pseudo-randomness ever being big enough to increase the odds of breaking key security.  The "universe of keys" is just too great (barring some sort of quantum computational breakthrough).

I don't think that includes sells

Nice job redrawing the logo, thanks.  I did the same thing about the same time and also came up empty.

Nice work. Interesting.

maybe some version of vanitygen?
if not vanitygen, contact someone in a vanitygen pool/website, they might do it for a small fee (depending on how long it would take)
edit: i guess they'd have to tell you how to do it or you'd get robbed
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:11:14
Yeah I think they made 50 bucks

Maybe we can come up with some kind of plastic card to use as wallets.  Then when we pay for things we can swipe it through a device that reads it. Just kidding.  Actually I have thought of this same idea you mentioned; an extremely small dedicated device so as to enable safe storage/transfer of bitcoin.
