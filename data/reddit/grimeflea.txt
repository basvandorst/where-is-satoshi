Don’t be so toxic for fuck’s sake.
Wouldn’t you want to find a way to open your wallet if you had 1800?
That’s worth nearly $14m. 
If you knew you could buy a house or pay for someone’s medical care in your family or do something significant with the cash, now or in future, don’t you think you’d want it back?
Bloody hell.

Open up 3 positions and you’ll be winning one way or another all the time.

Boomer is aimed specifically at older people, no matter how you use it. That’s where the phrase was born and will always have that connotation.
Much like the ‘identify as’ joke is aimed at trans people in its original context, and using it as something else is still seen as joking about trans folks even if that’s the furthest thing from your mind.
Using boomer as something else doesn’t make it not aimed at older people.
It’s specifically in use to tell someone they’re out of touch and don’t understand current culture, trends and important issues among under 35 yo people. Yes, it can apply figuratively, but it’s always going to infer you’re talking to someone you think is old and out of touch.

You’re clearly refusing the answer the question. If you had nearly double your worth stashed, you’d want it back.
OP is just asking for help. You’re just here kicking up sad trombones. Seems you’re the one needing a life.

You are a complete idiot.
You don’t know how your theory will live out, stop calling others fools, moron.

Clearly you don’t have the right friends in the 0.1% class.

Fair enough.
I just don’t think a blanket judgement like this applies either to millennials or bitcoin.
But that’s just me.

Of course, that’s a simple conclusion. But short of that, the majority of people who bought at lower prices and held on have all gained significant value.
Obviously *lower prices* is also relative to where in the spectrum you bought since buying today has no bearing on being a low price for someone who bought in ‘14/‘15.
But it seems to me that over a 2+ year period of patience, your investment really grows. It’ll be interesting to see if 2020 beats the all time high as everyone projects.

I’ve seen Lightning Network mentioned a few places but I’ve been out of the loop. What is it, or do you have a good link I can look up to learn about it?

You’re forgetting halving.
Every 4 years it halves, meaning mining yield/reward is half of what it was before the halving.
May next year is the next halving point.

Nothing has performed as well as Bitcoin on a long enough timeline, unless you’re one of the unlucky ones who bought at its height, hoping for the moon. But over the span of the decade it’s done nothing but gain value.

There’s also Adblock ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

That’s a huge reply beyond what I expected, thank you.
I’ll give this a read tomorrow when I get up!

Yes but you can’t argue anyone who’ve had the coins a few years have lost value so your entire argument is moot.
Bitcoin has done nothing but gain value *in the long term*. 
Obviously for this to hold true, it would need to be something you can still sell/buy in a few years to actually realise that profit, like any stock.
The guys who lose money are the short term folks who see a drop and bail, and possibly bail on lower than they bought. If you’ve stayed in longer than 3 years from *any* purchase, you’d have had big value gains over what you paid for.
