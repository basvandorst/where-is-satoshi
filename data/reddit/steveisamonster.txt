I started playing Magic: The Gathering earlier this year. With Bitcoin Paranoid set to update each hour, I check the price maybe once a day in passing. It's too much effort to have two addictions.

@_date: 2013-04-10 21:29:02
What I've been seeing on clarkmoody is tons of buy orders being rapidly put in for 0.01 BTC just a few fractionsnof a cent apart. Then once a buy wall breaks above it, they're all sold off. And then it repeats. Pretty sure this is driving up the lag. And the orders are definitely being put in by bots, there's no way else to explain it in my mind.

I sold at 87.17 before heading home. On the way home it hovered around 78-ish when I got a call from the fiancee that the internet was out. While fixing that, it jumped back up. All in all i made 0.06 BTC. Not a bad $5, but it could have been $100 :/

I'm afraid I don't understand the bottom chart... 
@_date: 2013-03-27 04:16:43
That's why I buy or sell at strange numbers. During the crash last Friday I sold at 67.74 and bought at 62.17. That way I know it will buy easier than 62 and sell easier than 68. Or something like that. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:30:14
I say it was the collapse of a bubble spurred by the DDoS. But everything with in the Bitcoin market happens so quickly, it's possible that were already heading back up. Heck, it never dropped below 50, perhaps this was just another flash crash on the rise up after a particularly large exponential climb. All I know is I suck at trading and have lost a little over half of my BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:18:29
Oh my... That's... That's a REALLY big deal. I mean, millions of people who read Fox News' website. And the audience is the type of people that are buying gold and hate the Fed. Mind you, many of them won't even begin to figure out how to purchase them, but this is big for those that are savvy enough and haven't heard of it yet. If the growing trend can continue for the next several days, there will be substantial  influx of new users coming in. Hopefully this isn't the straw to break the proverbial camel's back as the Gawker article was...
In other news, why the hell is there suddenly a 11,000 BTC at $91.95? I just walked out of a movie and what is this?
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:23:23
Not to be banging on your idea but I'm not sure that's the direction we want to take with Bitcoin. To me, a mascot seems a bit cutesy and childish for a currency. Companies and corporations have mascots but you don't see that with banks and credit companies. For Bitcoin, you need a recognizable logo. 
Think of it this way: does the dollar, euro, or pound sterling have a mascot? Nope. But almost everyone recognizes $, €, and £. I think that having a mascot could give the wrong idea and that we want to be taken as dead serious. Individually we may not be. But as a user group, we've invested over a billion dollars into this. 
Now, one way to have a mascot is if it's like the MGM tiger you see at the beginning of movies. It doesn't have a personality but figuratively everyone recognizes it. Or perhaps how the bald eagle is the "mascot" of the US. But I don't want an Aflac duck, or Wendy, or the Geico gecko. They're caricatures. If we have a mascot, I want something that's serious and doesn't exude personality that's is fun or can be laughed at. 
I hope you don't take this personally, this is just my impression of the needs of the community. 
And if they do end up making a mascot, how about a miner, hard at work in the mine shift to provide an income for the family and an important resource to the community. Serious, dedicated, honest. With a pickaxe, a lighted hardhat, and a mustache. 
Yes I'm being contradictory now. Deal with it.

Exactly why did it crash anyways? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:07:32

@_date: 2013-02-22 03:14:20
It is the number of Bitcoins that have to be bought in order for the price of the per Bitcoin to reach a certain price. If you go to [MtGox Live]( you will see a vertical portion of the blue line at $32.00. The height at that line is roughly $43,000 meaning that $43k has to be spent buying Bitcoins before the price reaches that level.
Many, many people had open orders selling Bitcoin at $30 because that is a nice round number close to the maximum price in June of 2011. This was represented by a vertical line (read: wall) that was about 10k BTC high, which means that people would have to spend ~$3 million on Bitcoins before the price could rise above $30. This was basically a whole lot of people wanting to cash out their BTC when it hit $30 (and probably make a pretty penny in the process). However, now that the price is above $30, they have lost potential money based on the greater future value of the Bitcoins they used to have vs the cash they now have.
The MtGox Live website has a pretty good explanation of the lines as well. The orange corresponds to a price drop.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:40:51
How much do you suspect that they make in a day on trading fees. It obviously varies on the day and market environment, but its gotta be huge. I wonder what percentage of the bitcoins out there that they hold just from fees...

@_date: 2013-04-04 12:53:20
If I'm not mistaken, the crash in 2011 occurred prior to the MtGox hack. It was already going down. The nail in the coffin if you will. 
But yeah, we've suffered lag and mini bubbles/crashes and the fork and we're still alive. But the exponential rise of the past weeks scares/excites me. I don't know what will kill It since we've survived severe loss of confidence that would in other commodity markets be potentially fatal. 
Realistically, what could the government do that would actually hurt us?

I suspect that this is a major crash, perhaps even the bursting of some bubble. However, as we've already experienced a bubble two years ago, people will want to buy up all the cheap coins and drive the price up. But, we've still only erased a couple weeks of massive unsustainable gains. It will go on. But damn I hate that the price is going down. I can't help but consider this the (temporary) Big One. Sigh... Bad feels
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:36:40
How does it work? Is it different from what we currently have with the bitcointip bot? 
@_date: 2013-02-19 22:22:36
Just means more subscribers for me to buy! 
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:29:02
Also, anyone know of a good trading bot that will set up a sell order at $20-30 below last price if it falls under a certain level? Say, it falls below $100 and I want to sell at $80. I have a job and can't watch the ticker all day. I'm suspicious of a crash in the next week or two and I'm trying to offset my wedding bands with this without selling too early or late. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:32:47
It has a running live trade ticker, market depth chart (not a graph so it's a lot better IMO) and it shows the lag. Also you can see price history quite far back. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:44:04
Starts at 0.6% but as you trade more it goes down. I'm sitting on like 0.55-0.53%.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:05:08
But note your use of the word "if"... 
@_date: 2013-01-24 17:31:19
So I've had a few bit coins since shortly before the bubble, but I don't understand what market depth and all that means. Would you mind explaining? 
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:08:42
Okay thank you. I've been invested since before the bubble, but I just don't get mining, you know? Always wondered. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:02:10
Yes, I was being facetious 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:51:44
After this, I'm definitely migrating. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:16:18
When I sold, price was still dropping. It was at 95 when I got in the shower and 76 when I walked out the door. MtGox had been leggy and ddos'd the night before so I just assumed it would go back to $30 or so and cut my losses. There was no way of knowing where the bottom would be. I get to work and it's at $60. Then it rose. 
To be honest, I still am not sure if we've entered recovery. We may still be bouncing down the hill. We may know better in a could hours when this current triangle closes up. So I'm still hesitant to buy back in. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:33:58
@_date: 2013-01-29 19:28:51
Ah. Yeah I was one of those. The fund transfer time took a long time so I didn't get in until late on the slope and it dropped off so suddenly I didn't have any time to pull out for a gain. I put back in in November when I suddenly remembered it and now I'm keeping it in, for better or worse. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:41:37
Eh it may be just a few weeks to months I think 
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:37:36
Its really not much of a guessing game. You have to look at the buy list and the sell list. Once it reaches a peak, look extra carefully and as soon as it begins to drop, sell at whatever price will let you clear your inventory.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:31:50
Ugh... I still don't get mining.

@_date: 2013-04-12 04:26:15
MtGox has been increasingly laggy with smaller weekly selloffs. The selloffs have also become more frequent. A lot of this is due to MtGox being ill prepared for high trade traffic. That combined with bots that input orders for 0.01 BTC fractions of a cent apart causes it to lag further when then price drops. People can't buy or sell during a lag, they put their money into fiat to be safe, price falls, lag ensues, ad nauseum. When we reached this particular high, it just couldn't be handled. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. Speculators sold off in droves when they saw that it had dropped so far and had no sign of stopping. When it hit 180 I knew we hit the big one. Held like a spartan. Though I ran to other exchanges a lot. Still, 700% in 3 months, not bad. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:42:51
Yeah but I don't know German so it's no biggie
@_date: 2013-01-29 15:02:24
But that occurred after the bubble burst in June. Why the sudden, severe drop from 30 USD? 
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:45:47
So whenever a new block of transactions is formed, the miner get the 25 BTC reward for the last transaction in the block? 
@_date: 2013-02-18 23:08:23
It's a control system. Think of your shower. You hop in and it's a little cold so you turn it up. Oops, you went too far and you're burning up. You turn it down a little. Just right. Here, you are the control system and you gradually get the temp right. A PID is a method/device/math for doing this. 
If you were to plot the temperature over time, it would look a lot like that difficulty chart. Cold, too hot, just right. Except at the last second you twisted the knob off and are quickly approaching melted flesh. 
I should mention PIDs are used in huge number of applications: electronics, temperature control, chemical manufacture, and they do more than just temp. Concentration, flow rate, current, any engineering control system really. 
That's basically a PID purpose. I think.

True, but the kicker here is the chat window directly on website. Its full of people trying to artificially boost or crash the price of any of the various currencies... and it works really quickly. And if you have a few Bitcoins to your name you can influence the market yourself. Its... really quite effective.

I don't think we are doomed to fail. But the ride to the top, no matter we're talking about, is always bumpy as we adapt/discarded our old ways to adopt the new. 
All of the trouble we face is because we are struggling to adjust. We still like having the centralization of MtGox but we are seeing the problems that causes. Don't worry. We will get there.

Oh yeah, I'm still doing alright, I just wish I had sold briefly at 225 when I thought about it (cloud judgement, greed does). It's just hard to determine if there is still confidence at this price. Maybe we'll see another big rise in the coming weeks, maybe we're just bouncing.
