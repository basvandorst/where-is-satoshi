Thanks for the source, but I don't see base blocksize actually mentioned in your quote. Satoshi may indeed have been fine with reasonable blocksize increases (as most of us are), but he was also just fine with second layer solutions, as another source on this page shows. 
If both the above assertions are true, he would certainly be fine with bitcoin's direction, which is doing both via segwit and lightning.

Thanks for the source, but it shows that Satoshi considered gradual base blocksize increases as a solution, not "the" solution. If anything, the quote shows he would NOT like a huge, sudden increase from 1 to 8 mb in a single step. 
How would you infer from this quote that Satoshi would be opposed to alternative ways of increasing blocksize space, like Segwit?  Segwit is certainly more in line with a careful and gradual increase.

Moderation isn't censorship.  Moderation isn't about banning ideas or valid topics.  It's about reducing spam and other off-topic nonsense.
I've personally been censored on r/btc.  In my case it WAS an important story, the night my account got hijacked to upvote r/btc stories. 
That's obviously an important and relevant topic.  r/btc removed all attempts to allow victims to report it while it was happening.
Examples:  note these say "removed" at the top.

Which is pretty much what I said.  We need a major correction.  If price just races to $100,000, that's what 2013 looked like - price went from $10 to $1000, a 100-fold increase in under a year's time.
The equivalent this time would be $1,000 to 100,000.   It is indeed happening, but to be healthy, it should take at least until 2020 to reach that price level.  If it happens as soon as next year, we are risking a major crash or bear market.

Interesting exchange with father-in-law.  He's very interested in my Bitcoin investment, but every time it comes up he strongly cautions me to sell right away to lock in my gains.
I point out that if I listened only to his advice, I never would have bought it in the first place.  
The argument that works on him is to say that I have researched Bitcoin very thoroughly, as any investor should do with a risky investment.  And that I have an exit strategy I will follow if the signs point to the necessity.

I agree the present growth rate looks dangerous.  
Look at a long-term chart (exponential) for bitcoin.   Example:
Draw a straight line connecting all the lowest points on the chart.  That's the support level.  The price has never (yet) gone below this line.  
The danger happens when the price goes up so fast that it gets very far away from this support level.  Sooner or later, it's likely to correct back to this support level.  Depending how far away the price gets, it could happen as a correction, a crash, or a bear market.   
The shape of recent activity is beginning to resemble 2013.  If it keeps following that pattern, we could get $100,000 by next year.  But the risk of a very, very large correction - or worse - would be very high.   It would be healthier for Bitcoin if it takes until at least 2020 to reach $100,000.
If you look at the linked chart, the long-term moving average could be a good tool to use for exiting your Bitcoin position - trade out when the price line crosses the average.   Trade back in when it crosses the other way.

I use a Coinomi wallet.  Makes transferring from one crypto to another one absurdly easy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:29:58
Sadly, all it takes is one tiny security flaw not considered.  This could happen to anyone.
I set aside a computer (a Chromebook) that is used ONLY for cryptocurrency transactions and nothing else.   I store coins in multiple places, some on a Trezor.  Some in paper wallets (in very well-thought-out hiding places.)
A small amount is in a wallet on my phone, just for making purchases.
And I never send a large value in one transaction.  I split it into smaller pieces, and wait for confirmations before sending the bulk of the money.

How many bitcoin millionaires exist today?  We need our own lobbying organization.  
If we join together we should be able to make congress respect/fear us as much as the gun lobby.
I wish I had the background to start this.  I will join, though.

I'm lucky that I had only bought a few bitcoins on the way up, during that huge bubble in 2013.  I was still feeling very experimental about it.
My relatively small investment wasn't enough to induce panic when the price started to unwind.  I thought instead that I would simply buy lots more at the bottom, which, luckily, I did.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:42
A large correction around 20k would be a good thing.  If you look at a long-term chart (look at an exponential chart), you can see the shape of the present activity is starting to look a lot like 2013.
If it follows that pattern, we could have $100,000 sometime next year.  But getting that far, that fast, without a major correction could set us up for another extended Bitcoin bear market, like 2014.

Granted, you have to decide for yourself what it means.  I am applying the tools I am familiar with from stock market charting.  
Bitcoin's charts do seem to be following the same general rules and patterns, at least so far.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:28
Really? It didn't???
I was there.  I know my Bitcoin history well.  Here's the long term chart (exponential)
Look at $10.  Look at $1000.  That's about a year apart.   I don't care if you want to divide that into two rallies, my point is about the 100x price increase in the span of about a year.
I'm not yelling "bubble".  You can call it whatever you like.  My point is that it's healthier for price not to increase so fast.  It's dangerous.  If Bitcoin gets set up for another huge crash or bear market, it won't be good for us.  
EDIT: you may assume I'm "new" because my username says "about a week".  In fact, my Reddit account was hacked recently, so I made a new one for commenting here.  I've been here for a decade.

Personally, I'm a fan of extremely elaborate hiding places.  Your paper wallet, Trezor, or passphrase are all tiny items, and easily hidden. 
Come up with really, really good hiding places, much better than under your bed.  The kind you spend a month of thinking to come up with.  The kind that might even require you to construct or modify a common object in your home.
The best hiding places, though, are PART of your home (so nobody can accidentally or purposely take the item out of your house.)  
Have at least two really good hiding places, and hopefully several.  Divide your stash up so no one hiding place has your whole bounty.    Plus, you want at least one additional copy of every private key or password, this gives you at least the chance of moving the coin before the thief claims it.  
At least one hiding place should contain only a small amount of bitcoin.  This is the one you would give up under threat or torture.
No, I haven't been obsessing about this.  Not at all.

No, you'll get the same value in BTC, which will be under a tenth of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:27:02
I agree, if everyone owning at least one Bitcoin joined together and donated a bit, we could have a lobbying and PR operation big enough to rival the gun lobby.  (EDIT: The Bitcoin Foundation could become this organization.)
Politicians would fall over themselves to please us, and media would gobble up the press releases.
If we don't do this, it will be done for us by people we may not like.  Oops, it already has been.  It's called Coin Center, and it's funded by the business side of crypto.  
The board has people like Jeff Garzik on it.  Think about who else in the crypto business world will be very interested in joining to push their agendas.

If money buys power, Bitcoin holders are missing the opportunity to control situations like this.
Where's the Bitcoin lobby?  Why do we not have one?  How many Bitcoin millionaires exist today?
We could make congress as afraid of us as they are of the gun lobby.

I can turn off updates.
The interface is just a web browser, there are no other executables, and no obvious way to add any.   It seemed to me to be a difficult machine to plant any malware on.
If you know of specific vulnerabilities, I do want to know about them.  
I chose a Chromebook because it's inexpensive, and not a typical target for virus writers.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:43:24
I get your point, but you can't make ALL the old rules go away, no matter what you do.  People will still convert to old-style currencies, even when Bitcoin is widely adopted.  And like it or not, government WILL make laws to impede adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Buying political power may be an old-school idea, but it plays well into the strategy of undermining existing power structures.  Using the system to change itself is one of the best strategies for effective change.

It's time bitcoiners got a lobbying group set up.
How many millionaires do we have?  There should be a strong, well-funded advocacy group doing not just lobbying, but strong, positive media outreach.  
Look at what Ver is doing in the media spending a few of his dollars.  He's just ONE millionaire.  If thousands of Bitcoin millionaires joined up, we could make congress as afraid of us as they are of the gun lobby.

From someone used to looking at stock market charts, this is what I see. 
The crash starting in December is a reaction to Bitcoin rising too fast.  The deepest downward spike we got really only took the price back to the support line from the 2017 rally (support line is the upward sloping level the price doesn't go below.  Resistance line is the downward sloping level the price doesn't want to go above. ) So technically, the 2017 rally continues. 
Right now, I see a pennant formation, with the peak of the triangle (where support and resistance lines meet) happening near the end of March or beginning of April.  Typically (not always), the direction the price breaks out of the pennant will tell you where its headed.  For now, though, the price moves up and down in a smaller range as we approach the point of the pennant. 
If the breakout happens in the downward direction, breaking below the 2017 support line, it could mean a march down to the 2014-2016 support line. Could mean $3000-5000 Bitcoin.  But even in that worst case scenario, the 2014 line should take us back to $10000 by year's end. So we'd end up the year where we started. 
Note: there's still room for the price to go down to 7000- something (if it happens soon) without breaking the 2017 support line.
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:45:01
This support line is the same one the price followed before 2017.  Look at an exponential plot, draw a line under 2016 prices, extend to today.  If price follows that line, 2019 will be the recovery year, price will get back to 2017 high around the end of next year.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:55:09
My take is that BTC price has been approaching Bitcoin's long term support line.  If price kept going sideways, it would have intersected the support line around Christmas.  By going down and hitting that support line today, Bitcoin should begin trending up shortly, following that line upward.  IMHO, it's very unlikely Bitcoin would violate that support line, which has held since 2011.
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:40:01
Yes.

Capital gains tax rate is actually zero if your income is low enough (under $75,900 for a married couple.)  If you can shift some income into the next year to stay under this threshold, this is one of the best strategies to use.
I have been avoiding selling any of my bitcoin, but I do trade the GBTC Bitcoin fund inside my IRA (where it is safe from capital gains taxation.)
