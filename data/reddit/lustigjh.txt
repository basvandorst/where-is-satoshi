For individual controversial issues that makes sense but we can't possibly make every bill a referendum without basically eliminating the government. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:28:49
I was referring to Congress. Your question is correct, but I think it's difficult to boil government down to the point where every issue can be decided by referendum.

People whose ideologies change based on their condition aren't really ideological as much as they are selfish.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:23:34
I think I follow. You're asking, "Why even vote for politicians at this point?", right? Honestly, I'd be surprised if we didn't wind up going in that direction in the future.

Lol, not giving him money then, fiat or otherwise
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:57:02
Litecoin is the Nickelback of cryptos. It's a perfectly good crypto but hating on it is popular regardless
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:04:08
 As opposed to liquid moldy apples?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:01:49
Single issue voting is part of the problem in this country

6,000 dollarydoos?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:41:09
Huh? What does that have to do with what I said?

OP might be used to writing letters. It's common to sign your name at the end there and makes it more personal
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:22:33
Discouraging new money isn't going to help get you a lambo. Maybe an old jalopy
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:24:50
Woops, I missed the joke "133 years" part of your comment.  My fault for being an asshat, but without that part of the comment, you do sound like the kind of person who looks for any excuse to brag about Trump's win, justified or not.
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:03:28
Did you really need to bring politics into this thread?

A coaster manufacturer that puts old wooden coasters on steroids

Honest question, what's the point of posting this on Reddit? Shouldn't this be sent to, you know, Mycelium?
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:54:10
 That is not dead which can eternal lie...
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:52:21
 It might help to make that clear in the OP because otherwise it just sounds like attention- seeking whining
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:12:12
Don't get me wrong, I think that's an interesting idea if done right. I think the same issues with the current system will transfer over, though (people who think they're informed but aren't).

I thought she was particularly valuable during the primaries for how she could actually give straight, concise answers to questions on the spot
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:03:10
Being a dick about it is only going to discourage people from trying again.
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:59:24
Geez, that took a left turn
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:57:46
People are still beating this dead horse? Bad decisions or not, they at least survived the tech bust. It's like everyone refuses to see nuance in her tenure because they can use it to argue politics
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:03:45
I'm planning to do the same when I get there

Kind of a lame comeback tbh unless you actually bought everything directly with btc without ever converting to fiat
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:16:33
An audit
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:24:44
Same, as well as sia and rdd. Woops
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:11:52
Yeah, rdd's got some good stuff coming.  I'm probably going to stake what I have soon anyway
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:11:01
If I had a btc for every time I traded something actually useful for a fucking tf2 hat...

Ordering drugs from a random stranger online hardly qualifies as "responsible" or "safe"

He probably just doesn't think losing thousands of dollars is a joking matter anymore
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:19:51
Don't forget the part where he allegedly paid to have people killed

I'm a big fan of childish reimaginings of names and this one is hilarious
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:29:56
Too bad the libertarians were too busy dancing around naked on stage and arguing for letting 5 year olds have access to heroin to put a decent candidate on last year's presidential ticket

If you're in certain areas you can probably find a bitcoin ATM to get money onto Bittrex
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:00:10
You're right. I forget to distinguish small-letter from Capital-Letter political identities sometimes
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:43:34
Take it easy jerk, all the guy did was remind you there's no guarantee bitcoin will keep rising. It's incredibly foolish to think otherwise
