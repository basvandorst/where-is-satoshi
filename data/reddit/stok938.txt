Wow, that is straight up retarded. 
There is no guarantee you will get your data back. This is why we don't negotiate with terrorists. 
Just back up your stuff
But yeah keep buying I guess.

It's just an artist interpretation... no ones really getting choked

You should take a giant loan out on your house, that guy seems to be doing alright
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:12:28
What the heck would AI need money for?
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:39:53
Btc is about to dip down to 5 bucks today, and then begin a sharp rise to 10,000 tomorrow
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:21:27
Funny I was planning to buy today anyway, regardless of price. Was expecting to pay 2900 or so. Imagine my surprise when I see it's 2500. I'm fine with that
I've got a little more set aside to buy lower, and it looks like I'll need to use it
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:20:04
Stay away
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:46:36
Do you mean a coin that has a sort of "gold standard" but some other tangible asset instead of gold?
I'm not aware of any if so, but there's so many damn coins maybe
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:01:39
:edit misunderstood
From what I understand though, they are allowed to withdraw a small amount. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:52:29
I'll tell them to hold, but I'm holding too either way. Why would I sell?
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:26:42
I can have most of the benefits of a $60-$100 hardware wallet with a simple USB drive that I already have a ton of, and I on top of that I have more flexibility because I can use it with pretty much any coin and any wallet. 
An exchange wallet is obviously not comparable to this
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:40:20
Don't do it all at once. Buy a bitcoin, see how it goes though. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:01:25
Yeah I got in just last week at ~1700 and I'm still in the green. So in context, I'd say bitcoin is still holding up pretty well.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:39:18
I expect it to drop, but not past 2000. 
Best thing to do is hold in that situation
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:32:03
I know everyone is here is all about hodling, but really spending your coins at the companies who support bitcoin is good for the community and good for the future of bitcoin. 
If you're wanting to buy something, make it a point to see if you can buy with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:39:42
Temporarily grounded for me. Too bad, I was just about to make my first trade there after hearing the good recommendations around here
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:59:29
This is what I prefer. Hardware wallets are just too pricey for what I have in crypto to make any sense.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:26:24
Nobody does
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:27:34
All exchanges are getting overloaded. Same with coinbase, same with Gemini. Took me 4 days to get verified on Gemini, and on my 5th day no verification from kraken. It is what it is. 
It's not a big deal, they don't owe us anything, you can try a different exchange but they're all having the same problems
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:58:22
I'm a beginner and I've had no problems with electrum. That's what I recommend. 
If you ever get serious, get a ledger nano s though
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:44:30
Love the meme but...
How are they going to confirm that the recipient is being honest and is actually in need?
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:32:41
That's nice dear
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:56:41
They lose like 50% of their value as soon as you drive off the lot. Better to just hodl 
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:08:17
I think whether it's an investment or not depends on your mindset. You don't consider it an investment, ALOT of people do. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:56:49
Yes but bitcoin has doubled in a month compared to usd.
It's not quite gotten that bad yet. I know that inflation is certainly affecting the price, but that's not the only, or even the biggest factor
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:48:23
Exactly how I feel. Bitcoin is a long play for me. It's a store of value as others say. 
I do use alt coins for smaller amounts and shorter terms. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:53:59
Yes I'm getting out of Coinbase as soon as my identity gets verified on other exchanges. 
But to be honest, a lot of the exchanges are having problems
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:38:45
Steam games. Hardware wallet as mentioned above
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:30:46
That's a totally arbitrary definition that you just made up though isn't it?
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:32:36
It's overvalued based on some arbitrary percentage that you just pulled out of thin air?
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:03:00
Yes, but you shouldn't sell your ether
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:42:59
Hmm yes yes I agree
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:56:11
About 4 days for me. And it was right in the middle of the big activity storm we just had recently
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:32:43
That's actually why i asked. I used cryptoderivative the other day to buy some GNT, worked pretty smoothly for me. Pretty much instant
Thanks for the info though.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:51:56
Wait. Wouldn't that mean EVERYTHING would be getting more expensive?
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:05:25
I'm sorry, vice is not a trustworthy news source for anything. Not gonna bother clicking the link
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:39:54
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:56:59
No, I haven't had any reason to contact support
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:06:40
I'm so tired of all the conspiracy crap here. I'm sure it happens, but if all the allegations were true half of the users here would be paid trolls. They're not
But I'm probably one too, since I've only been on 4 weeks. It's not just this site though, there are so many online communities are falling into this
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:08:26
Lol what on earth are you talking about
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:03:35
I think the price is pretty high considering the turmoil bitcoin is going through behind the scenes
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:39:43
Just for fun, not planning on getting into any arguments here
I'm a classical liberal or a libertarian. I voted for Trump, and I'm actually pretty happy with what he has done, and is signaling towards regarding shrinking the federal government. But it's yet to be seen what will happen. I don't like him as a person, but the results so far at least have been good. He's not perfect, but I believe he was the best of the available options. Once the Libertarian Party offers up a serious candidate, I will vote that way without hesitation. But that hasn't happened in awhile. 
As a side note, I don't see how any one can be a statist and believe in bitcoin. It goes against everything they stand for, and proves it all wrong. The only ones on the left who's beliefs are not challenged by a decentralized stateless currency are actual Marxist, of the Marx variety and libertarian socialist. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:24:59
Because fees are too high :)
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:14:02
He's very concerned
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:05:25
What's the purpose of that? Eli5?
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:13:17
I've already sold all my bitcoin and I'm waiting for just that time to buy back in, starting to put together a little savings for the occasion. There will be blood
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:51:11
No problem with bank transfers. I've bought there twice with my bank acct. takes another 4 days for it to be totally cleared, but it's available for trading almost immediately, just can't withdraw
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:36:15
As I sit reading all your points, I agree, but at the same time, I'm wiping sweat off my forehead because I know it could be a lot worse
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:32:01
Pretty uncanny isn't it? It actually goes pretty much all the way down the list
But what does this have to do with centralization or the lack thereof?
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:02:41
I think there's some subliminal messaging there ;)
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:29:02
I would be surprised if a billion people all had the same opinion on the matter...
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:22:38
Actually I think we are firmly in the greed section. Look at what's happening
But I agree with Bitcoinissimple the chart will repeat itself at different scales as long as bitcoin is around
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:30:27
Ugh I'm so tired of all this conspiracy bs on both subreddits
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:42:06
No, cryptocurrency is blockchain. Bitcoin is a form of cryptocurrency. The article even recognizes this at the end, but just glosses over it in the beginning.
Bitcoin is clearly not inseparable from blockchain
