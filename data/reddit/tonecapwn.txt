Too bad my 401k doesn't have a Bitcoin option

Consider that most traders are trading stock on margin, which means if they also hold BTC they will need to sell BTC when their stock positions take a dive (margin calls). I believe this will mean when the stock market crashes in the next 6-24 months that BTC will also take a small dive, and then it will rebound hard upwards. Hopefully segwit and lightning are live by this time. I plan to BUY BUY BUY when the stock market crashes and BTC takes it's first little dive. Im also maintaining a position in precious metals, and those will see the same dive and peak

How is a country with the highest oil reserves in the world (higher than Saudi Arabia where police drive lambos) unable to feed it's people? How can we help these people help themselves? Can we provide a currency that can't be corrupted, transfers quickly, and with minimal fees?

Imagine if all your phones just got rooted by this install. Or your wallet info/key logger. Good work OP. Crazy how we will randomly install software from reddit but not wire transfer to a prince who needs our help? 
Edit, now that my phone is rooted , great app!
