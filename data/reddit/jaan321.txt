At the peak, mid December daily transactions on the BTC network were 500k, at present they are 40% of that or around 200k. Not sure what your idea of 'fairly consistent' is but a 60% drop isn't 'fairly consistent' in my books... a 60% drop would indicate mass exodus from the network. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of BTC and I want crypto to succeed as much as anyone. I'm not advocating BCH or any other coin either I just want BTC to be able to be used as decentralized, fast, low fee money, because in my opinion that is why it has value. If it didn't have these properties it would have never been used and would have never seen the adoption and resulting price increase. I hope LN solves the problem without adding a layer of banks on top of what could really have revolutionized the financial system and with it the world.

Pretty obvious isn't it? Everyone has stopped using or dropped btc as a payment method because it's become outrageously expensive, slow and unable to adapt to growing demand...

Ripple is a scam coin, had no idea about cardano or stellar being premined but iota can't be mined, that's it's main value proposition. No energy intensive mining required...

So many terrible reviews on play site... I'd be super wary. This industry is full of companies all to happy to take your money but won't let you withdraw until you've met kyc criteria that can take months or never be approved. Kyc should be required for deposits too in this instance. I'd steer well clear.

'The attackers'...? Really? People were just trying to use the network wanting to get a piece of the action. Who in their right mind would pay 20-50 dollars per transaction to 'spam' the network...?

Why not! I actually bought some too a couple months ago not knowing its true origins and once it went up 30% sold most to recoup my costs. I still hold a little that is now 1200% up... Not sure what to do now lol. I definitely don't believe in it but it owes me nothing so I'll probably just let it ride.

I guess scam coin was the wrong name for it. I don't like it because it goes against everything crypto stands for in my opinion. Its a 'bankercoin' EDIT: I guess it is a bit of a scam coin because most people buying it have no idea its a bankercoin, verified by 'trusted' nodes with a massive pre-mine. So basically a bank on the blockchain.

So... has this happened? Want to transfer some BTC to an exchange and sick of paying $50 each transfer so looking for one with Segwit enabled... assuming that will reduce fees?

From what I've read LN is a second layer of nodes that basically act like banks, making a small fee from every transaction. Nodes with the highest amount of btc available to them will be able to accept the highest transactions and therefore make the most in fees. How will this not lead to centralisation of nodes? I'd love it if I'm wrong but I see it progressing to a bunch of massive nodes (banks) all taking a cut and only them operating on the actual btc network that costs thousands per transaction, effectively making the original btc network inaccessible to all but the super wealthy and forcing everyone to use the second layer LN system, with the fees that come with it. Other than removing the ability to inflate the money supply, how is this better than the banking system we currently have?

Exchanges don't use the bitcoin network they have their own centralised ledger. The btc network is only used transferring btc to or from the exchange.

This isn't a good service even when they don't steal your money. The rate they give is around 1% lower than the current spot rate on Bittrex and coinmarketcap.com so they are taking fees and lots of them. Bitrex charges 0.25%... The site is so dumb that selecting an exchange of BTC for BTC even shows it as 1 ; 1.01 (1% fee!)  Stop paying exchange services they say. Yeah and start paying you 4X as much!!!??  How are muppet criminals like this making so much money... Anyone want to start up a crypto exchange? A community based on for the people?

Cool analysis but it all hinges on the fact we have hit bottom at 6k....have we?
