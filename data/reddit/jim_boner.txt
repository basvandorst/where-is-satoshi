How should you proceed? Well, you obviously can't afford to keep living like you are. It of course is hard to judge a random person on the internet because everyone's situation is different, so this post could be entirely useless to you.
* Sell one of your R9 280s
* Get your overspending on computer parts under control. Especially since you don't need that powerful a system for the games you play
* Sell your entire system if you still have the Phenom II and the 550ti. Decent setup.
* It is CanadianBitcoins responsibility to ensure the package gets to you. keep contacting them.
* Ditch Netflix, satellite TV and the other services you can. Stick to your torrenting.
* Perkinsfield seems like a small town. Whether or not you still have that airport job, you should be looking for work closer to you. Also, offer your services. Clearly you can repair and build computers, know software and web languages so network and get some jobs.
* strawberryswing1 is right. You should speak so a social worker rather than asking people on reddit. *Especially* when you provide such few details.
* I hate to say it but cats can be expensive if you are in serious trouble. I would look to put it up for adoption.


* a little financial responsibility goes a long way.
It's impossible to give someone advice on the internet. I hope something above is slightly useful. Have you considered just up and trying to find a job away from where you live now? Something that will pay enough for you to be able to afford an apartment nearby work? Just to broaden your horizons and even give you some change.
