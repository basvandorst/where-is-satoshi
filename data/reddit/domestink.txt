I see this point... but he's not really the kind of guy that would understand cryptocurrency. I really don't see it going much lower then where it is now and when it's all said and done, maybe he'll want to get more involved with the coin.

YES! I'm right there with you. Just bought quite a bit today.

I guess you're afraid to take risks..... this is extremely calculated and a reversal is probabilistically going to happen.

He just gave me the money. I think (legally) after I deposited it, it became my money/property.

I believe the answer you're looking for is yes
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:58:43
Seriously... all these negative posts are just driving down the price. Fucking idiots.

Agreed but I'm not the fool in this transaction. If Steve Jobs never took a chance, where would he have gone? If Elon Musk feared risk, where would he be today? Think about it.

Bitcoin is going to happen whether or not you like it or not. 
"Thin as an egg shell" ..... give me a break!!! Fiat is dead you luddite.

I believe (legally) whenever he gave me the check with my name on it, it became my money.

I believe you may be lost, Sir

I was actually seriously thinking about doing this before. The only thing is I wouldn't know where to go for the loan and timing that with when I want to buy it could be difficult. With the school money its simple, I already have it, just 'forget' to pay tuition.

One semester off isn't going to really hurt anyone in the long term. 519 right now.........
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:38:06
It's just one semester, I don't really see the big deal.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:45:19
So it's putting in a nice base... trading at 543 right now. You wanna stick to that 'lol...'?

It's panic. Capitalize on the panic. Simple equation.

Different place, different time, different situation.
