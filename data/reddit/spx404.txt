I hope I am not late.

Oh wow, didn't know the whole Black Arrow bit.  Well, I'm not holding my breathe for them coming back online.  I have bought so many miners from them in the past.
I'm curious to know if the low conversion price of Bitcoin is the cause of the final blow for them to come offline.

WOOW.  It is funny because after reading all about Butterfly Labs, I decided the risk was to high to purchase from them and went on a whim with Minersource and never had a problem.  I have to say I am pretty shocked what happened to you.  I guess this is always the case in Bitcoin.
Judging from their size, I am going to assume that they invested nearly 100% of their money into everything you listed.  Seems like solid argument.
It is sad!  I don't buy anything in Bitcoin anymore, it just sits around now doing nothing.  All these reports of scams are just backing me into a corner.
May I ask, did you only purchase pre-order stuff or did you purchase things they already had in stock?
For me I must have ordered at least 6 different miners in the very short time I knew they existed, everything was packed exceptionally well, so I figured I would always do business with them (mostly because I never had a problem and have never spoke to customer support).

This is going to sound crazy, and I'm okay with that, but that is more effort than it is worth.  It is way easier to just not go back...ever.
Thankfully, the good people of Reddit tell me what I need to know in the comments.

Thanks for the good information!

I wish I could go to Forbes... AdBlock is preventing me, probably for good reason.
