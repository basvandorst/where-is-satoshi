Yep that's a good way to get rid of all that pesky money's laying around!
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:30:56
It's mind blowing that a convoluted pipe dream of a fix barely make BTC competitive with other cryptos again?

North Korea is best Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:30:35
That's exactly my point.

Take a swimming pool out of a pond and it's noticable. Take a pool out of a lake and its bearly noticable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:13
My thoughts exactly. These days r/btc and r/Bitcoin look an awful lot like r/politics and r/The_Donald.
Nothing but brinkmanship and collusion accusations.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:56:45
Does anyone seriously think the public is going to accept a payment system that convoluted? Who the hell is going to stand around a store for 30 minutes just waiting for the money to be available? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:38:43
You mean Fake news networks are fake news?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:42:53
Yep I checked, I was one of them. All the Bitcoin I had in my mining account was stolen. All $25 of it.
Enjoy going to the movies mr. hacker, it's on me.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:51:54
All right now if you guys could just dip it down to 10,000 that be awesome
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:48:42
No. If people never stood up to Injustice is we would still have slavery and human sacrifices. Killing people for gain is wrong. Forcing people into hard labor for gain is wrong. Threatening people with death and imprisonment for gain is wrong.

Ya an AI secretly building dominance by lying to us kind of scares the shit out of me.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:15:55
Oh without question! My paycheck is still moving over.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:06:42
As an extension of this question how does exchange trading factor into that? Do I report what Fiat I put into the exchange and what I pull out of the exchange or do I also have to report every buy and sell?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:39:59
What if maintaining a blockchain doesn't actually require anywhere near as much processing power as people have been throwing at it and we are unknowingly building the brain of an AI?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:50
Why the hell do all these dips have to happen right after I pay up all my bills?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:20:12
Well shit haha
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:46:04
I think a lot of potential sources are holding off until the fee situation is under control again.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:09:24
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:43:06
How is this an exposed moment? The guy loves making money anyway possible and is not ashamed to admit it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:44
Don't worry. It's only facts.

It's what Netflix and chill leads to.

This one demonstrates learning capabilities
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:26:01
Nope. If I have to go back, I'm going all the way back. Living in the woods making tools out of the bones of animals. Clearly this civilization thing has failed.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:55:44
No, I said taxation IS slavery and human sacrifice.

Ordinary People got fed up with the high fees and the BTC/BCH drama bullshit and moved on to cryptos that are actually trying to improve things and provide real world value. 
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:35:38
You guys are making money?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:52:27
Usually it's there in a day and a half which would have been perfect timing. But I guess it got caught in that back up.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:27:12
I think you are on to something! I think you should be able to get a surgery to make it possible to quickly detach and rent out your kidney and then plug it back in a little bit down the road. In fact why stop at kidneys? Arms, legs, teeth or eyes! We can become a completely interchangeable Potato Head species!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:52
Yeah I really think they need to open a rehab center for gdax obsession.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:37:39
Na it's just a bunch of Millionaires scared the IRS will catch their scent.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:19:44
Of coarse it stated going back up before my money cleared into gdax :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:29
I second that!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:59:33
Except for that dip to 7200 since I sold at 7500
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:34:09
Only cash out $249,000 a year. That next step is doozy!
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:42:07
..... is a thing?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:50
Exactly. So why throw money away
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:13
Aw that was such a horrible game! 2-3 were some of the best games ever made.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:32:50
Except it undergoes correction all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:05:58
Exactly. Every time I get paid I buy a little more but every time I buy the same dollar amount and only get a fraction of what I got the previous payday.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:30:29
I don't always attempt Bitcoin Trading, but when I do I buy at the highs and sell at the lows.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:05
Take a look at the trade volume on gdax. It's double what it was just yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:30:47
You don't spend much time around the Crypto community do you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:44:41
Personally I moved about 60% into Etherium as I am 60% sure there will a decent sized drop once BTC hits the 10k mark. However, most of the time Etherium seams to follow right along with BTC so I could either even out, loose out on a jump up, or like in a few cases BTC plunges but Etherium jumps.
Really you just have to go with your gut on how sure you are it will plunge or jump.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:08
Oh hey! You must be the one that bought my Bitcoin! Nice to meet you!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:18:39
Which is a really weird thing to say considering electronics and especially the internet are the very first thing to go in pretty much any disaster scenario.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:42
The end is near! Burn all bridges! As an act of charity I will buy all your Bitcoin for $2000 so you can at least get something back!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:38
I was until it's stopped responding and I can't even load it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:32:49
This ain't the 90s! Who gives a shit about Tony Hawk anymore?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:44:53
It's irony. The money is finally available that I wanted to use to buy into the dip but it is way too late to do that. Because coinbase is slow as hell.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:29:03
I hope it's bellow 8k
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:40:50
Of coarse he was. You should try not to take everything so seriously.

Your blood work just came back, you have lymphoma.

Buy what you can. You don't need to reach a full Bitcoin before you buy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:36:46
Happy hunting!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:04:01
At least in the US hitting the $250,000 per year Mark puts you in a much higher tax bracket. Not to mention after that you become the punching bag for every political maneuver always represented as the evil capitalist.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:55
Na, I gave it away already. Sorry
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:26:24
I feel like you took my comment WAAY more seriously than you should have.

Oh my God 6K would be beautiful especially since I sold right before this happened!
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:28:56
The IRS doesn't care if you made money that year through your normal job or Bitcoin. You made money so what will be taxed. So for that year in your scenario you'll be taxed in the 240,000 bracket.

Well that is what the picture indicates.

No one is willing to pay more than 4299 for BitCoin and no one is willing to sell for less than 4300
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:27:11
Get behind my 4450!
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:02:49
If you think the primary reason for Bitcoin is to resist the banks then are not ready for this fight.
@_date: 2017-09-22 03:16:36
He misses you too. But, I am a generous god. You can have him back. All you need do is but give me 4500.

Like with a single pie or do you have a bakery?
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:36:58
But 89% of miners support this move!
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:56:32
Well you could always pay people in pie.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:29:28
Coinbase made a statement that once the fork is complete and both chains are working properly, they will add both Bitcoin and BitcoinGold to your account. So basically, you don't have to do anything.
