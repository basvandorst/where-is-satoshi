It's not wrong. Of course a dice-generated 50 character password is significantly safer than correcthorsebatterystaple, but that's only with our current computing power and the hashing algorithm.
Think for eg. if 10 years ago you had a 512 char dice-generated password that was MD5 hashed and was in a data dump after a hack, what good would it do today? It could be cracked in minutes, but 10 years ago it might have been height of good security (we're not storing it plaintext!)
