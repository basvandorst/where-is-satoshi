I had to wait 2 weeks and send a copy of my driver's lisence :)

You just discovered the real underbelly of why the top dogs voted how they did. 
Money making

Non of that *really* matters when you can have say, A child with zero in their account after being stranded somewhere and you can send them 100's instantly after typing in a 4 digit code into your phone. 
0-100's cash in hand in less than ten minutes. You can't say it isn't real.

Yep. Everyone says the BBC doesn't provide proof like bitxoun is the most important thing in the world. When they announce the death of a world leader they don't insert ref. It's a general news article with interviews etc. 
Secondly, say this guy is the real deal. First thing the most vocal follow group does is shit on then and discredit them? Real good for bitckin! 
Just because everyone imagined him to be some long haired techno-monk and might not be this sub will throw it's toys out the pram. 
Especially if this guy HAD to disclose his ID because of an investigation and all we do is attack him...

And that's kinda' bad reporting withig its self... Also 'when will the media learn' implies that the media wants to learn or sees this as something worth learning. 
Let's not joke our self's here. Bitcoin is not the price of oil nor does it require verification to the degree of Obama's death for example. It was just a new story

They don't! The news source there is direct. And let's ve fucking honest, we wouldn't belive the proof anyway. 
Oh easy enough to spoof or trick the journey
We will just have to wait and see
