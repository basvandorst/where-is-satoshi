All companies that operate in the uk must register on an open searchable register called companies House. They must name directors and file yearly accounts. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 13:56:25
They don’t show up on the companies House register!

Mini airdrop as a teaser? 
I often have dust amounts of random shit coins turn up on my wallets.  It’s just a form of advertising for their coin.

I would say asking people’s thoughts on a particular issue is part of doing your own research. 
You only get better at something by seeking alpha! 
Don’t let em grind you down. 
I also get into crypto dec 17.  Decided then not to drawdown a penny until at least Dec 18.
Give it time bro 1 BTC will always 1 BTC

I’ve looked at opening one in the UK but the sums just don’t add up! Rent, business rates, tax, wage, footfall etc! I just don’t see how they can turn a profit. Or am I missing something???
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:24:53
Once fb and other social media platforms embrace a crypto currency, the masses will embrace it. Will probably be a stable coin at first pegged to fiat. Then as it’s adopted more and more bitcoin will be seen as a store of wealth due to its scarcity!
@_date: 2019-02-16 10:21:41
It’s called theft by finding!
Even if someone puts items in a skip to be sent to the dump, and you remove said items it’s still theft.
That said, kerching!!! Get it sold and buy bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:40:33
Well I’m still buying bit by bit month on month! 
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:14:12

@_date: 2018-11-25 08:25:10
Bought in Dec 17, been buying in each payday. Lost around 60% of what I put in. 
At this point my nano is worth more than it’s contents..
I ain’t selling and I’m riding this wave to the bottom. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:14:23
Don’t waste your money on bitcoin buy tron trx it’s the future! ��
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:19:35
Only down 40%! 
I dream of only being down that much. 
At this point my nano is worth more than it’s contents!
Still buying more though. ��
