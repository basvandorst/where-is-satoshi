Hahaha. It's about as real as any other money. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:11:36
I'm positive I did, but how do I check?
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:57:28
As you'd expect. I wish I was so fortunate. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:28:31
It was too trusting on my part, admittedly. But you think that entitles ShapeShift to mislead through their app status and misappropriate my funds? They could have returned to the sending address, and could quite easily retain and return now, if as they state only exchange in crypto.
Think about this for a moment. Their website clearly states that they have a strict no FIAT policy on all operations. Yet their Director of Customer Services is telling me that they "frequently liquidate into FIAT to protect themselves and users funds". They're not even following their own Terms of Service. How do you expect anyone else to honour them. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:59:55
Thank you. Unfortunately it's had to be escalated to a solicitor, but the good news is that ShapeShift's 90 day refund terms have only been in effect since October. So at this time, nobody should be out of the refund window ��.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:53:17
I understand why you'd say that but when the app showed completed I assumed it wasn't missing. It was misleading. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:00:51
It's not the wrong argument though. And it's not a bigger amount, it's the same amount. We peg in crypto, not FIAT. When my exchange failed, it was held in ShapeShift's wallet. And then I'm told they liquidated it into FIAT.
What seems off to you? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:55:05
Your analogy is way off. I don't think you understand what's happening here.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:05:32
Nice one Jordy. Thing is on here, I know people revel in other people's misfortune. But I'm not after sympathy. I'm here to raise awareness of ShapeShift's poor practices, and to warn anyone who might not have checked their wallet. Taking ShapeShift at face value. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:23:04
It shows Order ID as unknown. The transaction page only shows the deposit address and withdraw address. I'll ask ShapeShift to provide me with the transaction details of the failed exchange. 
Yea, I got a hardware wallet I use for other funds. Cant see me using ShapeShift again mind in all honesty. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:48:30
Thank you

Hi guys,
This is me. I should explain. 
I made two exchanges back last year using the ShapeShift app. 4 BTC and 12.7 LTC into Monero (183.8). These are coins I put aside for my 2yo son. Like a savings accout for him. After some hours they both confirmed on the app, timestamped and showed completed. This was before their website was functioning as an exchange. I trusted the service and didn't check the Monero wallet.
Fast forward to last week and I'm checking the rates thinking Monero is looking good, I'm going to get it into an exchange and move it into some other coins. Checked the Monero wallet - 0 balance, no transactions. Looked at ShapeShift, the address was right except it was all lowercase?!
So I contacted ShapeShift through the app. Seen some related FAQs showing that if an exchange fails you'll get a return on the funding currency. Even better I thought. The BTC and LTC funded were even more valuable. Created a ticket, full details, screenshots. Everything. Left refund addresses for all three cryptos.
My first reply a few days later. Support seemed pretty helpful. They could see the BTC funding address but wanted me to provide the LTC one. So I replied with that. 
Few days later, I had another reply. We need your Order IDs. Bear in mind I've already sent everything, and the screenshots both show " Order ID: unknown". So I replied explaining this. Few days later again, I get a reply from their Director of Customer Services:
She says that refund claims must be made within 90 days of a failed exchange and that because ShapeShift doesn't save user details, they couldn't reach out. Referred me to the Ts&amp;Cs. Then goes to explain that ShapeShift liquidates unclaimed cryptos into FIAT to protect themselves from volatility and offers €2144 as a gesture of goodwill?! (The FIAT value at the time of exchange).
I'm raging at reading this. We're talking a good bit of dollar now. This is basically theft in my book. I'm not having it. So I replied and said I will accept a return on the funded Bitcoin and Litecoin, or the original agreed exchange on Monero ONLY. And I encouraged them to come to favourable terms or legal action would ensue.
So, here we are. Waiting another three days for my reply. I faithfully added some facts to their WIKI and I'm starting to look into things: - 
ShapeShift Company Info
" The company has a strict “No Fiat” policy, meaning it does not use banks or political currencies anywhere in its operations. "
WOW! So which one is it ShapeShift? Are you lying to all your customers or just to me?
Made two exchanges on ShapeShift, funded 4 BTC and 12.7 LTC. The exchange showed completed, but had failed without notice. I didn't check the wallet until last week and ShapeShift says it's out of their refund window. Ready to get my legal team on it. Keep you updated! ;P
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:46:52
Doesn't make them untouchable, or give them the right to misappropriate user funds. We'll see what comes of it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:28:11
Yea, that's the plan. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:37:27
Yea. You're probably right. Their offer is an insult. If they can't honour our contract then it will have to go through the courts. Let's see how their TOS hold up in a court of law. And if as they say are exchanging in FIAT, they'll have the whole AML regulations and non-custodial accounts issue to deal with as well. It will ShapeShift into a nightmare for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:32:50
This is exactly right. I've been preaching the good book of Bit for a while now. Couple of months ago prices were at £2400/BTC and my step father says, it's too late to get in now. I said you won't be saying that when it's £5000/BTC. And he wasn't, when it was. Few weeks later.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:21:13
Are you a company representative? Seriously. The exchange showed as completed. I've checked their API docs and it can, and should show as failed if that's what happened.
Their terms of service mean little when their app and service are misleading users. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:13:12
I genuinely didn't. I would have created a support ticket if I had.
I believe given the misleading information provided on the app, and them not following their own policy. There will be liability. Does it sound lawful to you, to provide a term that relieves you of your assets on a failed exchange within 90 days, on a non-custodial account?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:30:20
Do you know how ShapeShift works?
As I said in the original post. I am (was) happy to receive what was originally agreed which was just under 184 monero. So your argument is null and void there.
But if an exchange fails, as is the case here. The contract hasn't been honoured and the BTC and LTC is still mine. Which is why ShapeShift refund the funding currency.
What are you getting at? 
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:52:58
Yes already implemented. Long press on the area of map you want to search around. - To revert back to current location press the location arrow in the top corner.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:47:11
We got that feature added to our maps. All businesses with the bitcoin tag in OpenStreetMaps are automatically added to our own database and displayed within our app. We are now looking for business owners to provide further information e.g. Photos, Descriptions, etc..  to improve the user experience and advertise themselves more effectively.
- 
We are also working on improving the backend on features such as news before making further improvements to the app. As always let us know your feedback.
@_date: 2015-04-28 13:59:42
Haha. He doesn't even need a reason. Just because.. ;)
@_date: 2015-04-28 15:58:34
That's a good point. The USD has strengthened considerably over the past year.
@_date: 2015-09-20 10:14:33
Hello everyone. Our latest app update has just been released on iOS and we want your feedback and suggestions.
This update has been a long time coming and a lot of work has gone into it. We had some issues with the last build and we decided to start from the beginning rather than cover the cracks.
It's been re-developed specifically with iPhone 6(s) and 6(s)+ in mind. (As you may expect). There's a load of work done in the backend to allow us more flexibility.
- We've added more exchanges in our overview. The set-up is more robust than before.
- We've made some improvements with the Alerts section. This had some bugs in the last version and didn't work for everyone.
-The News Section is what really gets us excited. We hope it will be a good point for many to get their bitcoin news fix. Reddit proved hard to implement and we had to use a different method than what we used for other news sources but in our eyes it was an absolute must to include.
- The Browse and Map are still tight and we hope to get new businesses setting up in our database. We have the ability to offer more information on businesses accepting bitcoin.
Overall it is a massive step up, but we still want your suggestions as this app will continually adapt and improve. Android version in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:27:44
Apologies. Should have been more clear. Our iOS app isn't a bitcoin wallet.
We provide information and reference. (not integration)
You will find in the overview we have a comprehensive list of currencies and exchanges showing the latest prices as well as historical data and charts. With the price data you can quickly work out the Bitcoin - Fiat value in our convertor.
We have an Alerts feature that when triggered will send a notification or email to the user when the criteria has been met.
Our favourite section is the News. We've compiled a list of popular bitcoin news sources to provide a go-to point for latest bitcoin happening.
We have, what we believe to be the largest database of businesses accepting bitcoin that is available to users. You can use the location, near me section to view those business around you. Or you can browse for businesses with online stores.
I hope that clears up any confusion. The best way to find out what the app is all about is to go download it. You might like it ;)
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:11:43
Got to love a fresh set of eyes. Thanks 👍
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:54:39
Ah nice spot. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:38:31
What about future additions? Anything you would like to see in this app that's not there now?
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:01:59
Hi Michael,
That's awesome! I'll touch base and we'll get that added soon. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:57:34
Elite Bitcoin for iOS is on the app store ready for download - 
Come join us, take a look and let us hear your verdict. It's a massive improvement on version 1. We have a new feature where we need your help! We're looking for Bitcoin businesses to add their company to our directory so we can make the app better for its users and advertise you at the same time.
Loads of new additions. Looking forward to hearing your feedback. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:21:26
We're working on it. Unfortunately the other bitcoin ATM that didn't happen, has taken all the spotlight. Most news sources weren't interested in running a story even though we were actually the first in Wales. Figures. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:29:14
Pleased to be of service! Thank you 
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:15:33
We're looking to offer just that. Although we have other features included such as Price Overview and statistics on the most popular exchanges for each currency. Price Alerts and Convertor. News Section and Browse Store / Near Me.
We really like Coinmap.org. We'd love to offer their listings right of the bat but we don't want to take away from their hard work. Currently businesses would have to add their listings to our own database. But depending on the response we get this could be done soon!!
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:45:43
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:42:35
I couldn't possibly take money from you after you took the time to graciously critique our website.....
*new website coming soon*
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:45:35
That's interesting. We'll definitely look into it more. We actually thought about doing it early on but decided not to step on toes. It would be easy to implement.
We're looking to improve the app considerably, tailored around requests just like this, so thank you.
Have a look around the app and see what you think. I should have mentioned that it's free!! ;D
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:30:17
We are setting our Lamassu Bitcoin ATM to sell today. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:22:38
Sorry to hijack the thread. Just wanted to let people know that we have a Lamassu Bitcoin ATM already setup in Cardiff at The Castle Emporium on Womanby Street. 
Initially we were a little disappointed to hear that another ATM was setting up so close but it will probably be good for the Bitcoin community.
Best of luck in your unveiling tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:05:00
As we had to go public early after the impending unveiling of a rival bitcoin atm later today. We'd like to introduce Wales to it's REAL first Bitcoin ATM.
Our Lamassu Bitcoin ATM is situated at The Castle Emporium on Womanby Street in Cardiff. What used to be Cardiff Fashion Quarter is going through a rebrand to attract a broader clientele. We have a preliminary agreement to set each vendor up to accept bitcoin as payment in what we hope to become a Bitcoin Hub. This is an exciting move forward for Wales and Bitcoin. Feel free to give us a visit, and if you have any questions let us know. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:45:25
Bitcoin ATM inside the shop. Links goes to a basic website with contact info etc. No sketchy shenanigans here.
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:32:36
We were initially going to wait until The Castle Emporium had finished their rebrand and be a part of the launch campaign. But when we heard of the new bitcoin atm we knew we had to go public early. If anything it will be good competition to keep prices low.
We're also days away from releasing our Elite Bitcoin iOS app. Some of you may remember us from when Mt Gox was the main player. We've completely updated and we hope to impress. I will keep you updated.
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:25:26
We popped into FoundersHub Cardiff today to ask about the SatoshiPoint ATM. I was told there was no agreement in place. Then came across this: 
Anyone in or near Cardiff interested, please take a look at our ATM in The Castle Emporium, Womanby Street, Cardiff. Opening hours are currently Mon-Sat 10-6, with the look to extend soon.
