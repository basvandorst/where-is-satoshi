It doesn't take a psychologist to see you lashing out at anonymous people as a way of coping with whatever it is that's wrong with you. I'm not trying to diagnose you. It's just painfully obvious that you are a negative, shitty person. That's something you can change, but you seem perfectly happy doing what you're doing now.

I agree with your points. The amount of amateur php in this thread is just obnoxious. Everyone on reddit that wrote a hello world program for their CS class thinks they're experts on the subject.
PHP is great if you're careful. And you may have to be a little extra careful when writing PHP than let's say java. That doesn't mean it can't work for a financial site. There are more valid reasons you wouldn't want to use PHP for a financial site, however. Speed is one of them.

This problem has already been solved. I don't know the exact specifics, but to fix this, you can have a "duress vote" option that lets you do a real vote, and a fake vote. Your real vote will be untraceable, but when you attempt to confirm your vote, it shows the fake one.

You were making significantly more in BTC earlier on. Even if it was equally or less profitable in fiat, it was far more profitable in BTC.
I assume (although I know you hate it when I do that) that someone spending $2,500/month mining is doing it as a hobby. If that's true, you can afford the $2,500 from your job or other means. Nobody would be mining if they didn't think they'd make their money back long term, but it's never going to explode again like it did when it went from $5 to $1000.
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:16:57
Fair enough. If someone has control of your computer or network it's possible. That's beyond the complexity of most phishers, however. And if someone was capable of doing that, they may as well just steal your wallet or install a keylogger.

I think you are overlooking the biggest reason dogecoin is popular: most of us missed out on the bitcoin train. People mined millions of bitcoin when they were worthless. Now there's no way to break in to bitcoin without putting down a lot of money on a miner or buying coins. With doge, you can have the satisfaction of owning thousands of crypto coins without breaking the bank.
And yes, there's definitely greed. But as your name implies, you aren't doing this out of the kindness of your heart. I'm sure you have quite a nice pile of bitcoins for yourself. So it's hypocritical to talk down a competing alt coin when you have a lot at stake. If I got in early and mined a couple hundred bitcoins, I would be pretty interested in making sure my investment goes up too. But I wouldn't be so shortsighted as to write off competitors as "greedy".
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:30:15
Let's say bitcoin increases by 10x in the next five years. That means to stay competitive with other exchanges you have to decrease the fees 10x. That also means that your debt in fiat just grew to ten times the size it was. If it only took five years to pay off the debt, it will now take fifty years. And the higher the price goes up, the longer it will take to pay off. If bitcoin becomes widely adopted, the exchange will never be able to pay off its debt. 
This idea would only work if you don't have faith in bitcoin increasing by much in the next five or so years (being generous here).
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:02:08

That's pretty silly to call it communist coin. It's not even remotely similar to what communism is. This is more similar to auroracoin. It defeats the problem of giving too much to the founders. At any time, Satoshi could decide to sell 10% of the total bitcoin supply. No currency has that problem. Bitcoin will never be a proper currency for that reason.
A more interesting case would be if the United States decides to launch an official "USA Coin". They would announce months in advance when mining is open (no premine), and it would be fair because everyone would know about it. That's just about the fairest way I can think to do it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:44:22
A major obstacle to overcome is the fact that a few people have over 10% of the total bitcoins that will ever exist. That's enough to destabilize the market at any time. And while I do believe in bitcoin as groundbreaking, I think it will take a "version 2.0" to gain widespread acceptance. There needs to be a way to distribute it more fairly in the beginning. The person who starts the currency and the people that get in the first couple of months simply have too much of an advantage.

I'm not sure if you've successfully proven I'm making myself look like an ass. You just admitted my assumptions are correct.


You ran a computer program all day that cost you a couple extra bucks on your electricity bill. It's not like you actually had to put work in to it.
The only solution I can think of to fixing the greed problem is to create a coin that is evenly distributed initially. The problem with all of these coins is the pyramid-shaped distribution. The first few miners make a hugely disproportionate amount of the wealth. And that's why doge is so hopeful. We were "the first few miners" and want to add more people to the bottom of the pyramid. That's why you see bitcoiners so vocal about how amazing the technology is. Yeah it's great and has the potential to change the world, but you're just vocal about it because you have everything to gain. You aren't unbiased because you are heavily invested in crypto currency. It's human nature to want to protect your investments. Find me somebody who has 0 bitcoins and is equally as vocal about bitcoin as the guy with 250BTC.
