I'm a huge supporter of BitCoin, and really want initiatives such as the ZipZap adoption to succeed, but I can't help thinking that this is going to open up a huge and very visible problem that won't do BitCoin any favours at all.
At the moment, it is believed that fixed odds betting terminals (a sort of electronic slot machine, ubiquitous in betting shops in every town in the UK) are used by drug dealers to launder cash.  I don't believe that this is just a scare story, it makes practical sense, it's a quick and reasonably efficient way to legitimise large sums of money.   See, for example:
Now how much easier will it be if your local drug dealer can instead just walk down to his corner store and buy/sell bundles of cash for BTC every week?  I'm not making a comment on the wrongs of drug dealing or money laundering, or the accuracy or otherwise of the British press, but I am saying that the money laundering aspect is likely to attract quite a lot of media and possibly law enforcement attention if it takes off.   
I don't think BitCoin is quite ready for such large scale accessibility, it's going to be too easy for the general public to equate corner store BitCoins with drug dealers before they have the chance to understand the broader benefits.  Sadly, expect some sort of press outrage followed by a clampdown within about six months.

Sufficient investigation would also expose someone using the current preferred methods of laundering.  I think for your garden variety local coke dealer, BTC could nevertheless be a good enough mechanism to stay under the radar.  
Indeed, let's see what happens.  Maybe I'm being too pessimistic.  
Edit:  I just hope it doesn't make banks, and other businesses, even more suspicious of anyone transacting Bitcoins for completely legitimate reasons.
