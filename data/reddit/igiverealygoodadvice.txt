It was likely a larger order but this amount triggered at this specific price.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:30:39
Ok but how the fuck was there 997 Bitcoin at ONE price in the order book? That's an absolutely massive limit order.
Normally if a whale plops down \~$13 million they do it relatively slowly and not all at the same price since that's typically not even possible.

Yea I've got the lightning app already, but since you still need 2 on-chain confirmations to use a LN channel it may still be expensive :/

People always say "buy" and "sell" like it's 0 or 100. Best move is to buy and sell small amounts as you go to take some profit and reduce cost basis.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:28
Ah fair enough, what I meant was that people who simply downvote contrarian opinions are acting as censors for the group. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:26
But LN needs to use main chain to create a channel, so mempool most certainly will affect the LN.

+1 for being fast AF, fixed now :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:31:17
That's not what I mean, I'm talking about fees to open and close channels and not the LN fees themselves. 
To use a LN channel you need to post an opening and closing tx on the blockchain itself. If regular Bitcoin fees are $10, then every channel will cost ~$20 to set up. Say that channel has $1000 and you are still paying a 2% fee, even if the LN fees are completely free. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:31:11

By this logic, we can never have any discussions about negatives/drawbacks/things to be improved in Bitcoin without it being a "BCH psy-op"?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:47:13
How many UTXOs was that?  Fees are undeniably high right now and definitely will impact the price of LN as it requires 2 on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:40:28

There will be more than one app which is compatible with the same Lightning Network (same with how there are multiple Bitcoin wallet and node software packages you can run with the 1 Bitcoin network), but yea i like this one.
You can play around on the Testnet currently and see how it works, check out  to see what's happening!
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:03:45
Oh snap, i forgot to update - thanks!
Also - why doesn't the Core software allow you to update from the GUI?  Seems like that should be a thing...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:29:57
If you haven't found the info already, it's basically placing an order for a set price sometime in the future.
Say BTC goes for $15000 right now and you want to buy 1 BTC.  You could place a limit order for $14900 with 1 BTC through GDAX and then if the price falls down to that level ($14900) your order will "fill" and you get the 1 BTC for that price.
The same works for selling, but in the opposite direction (limit price must be higher than current price).  If you do it this way, you are a "Maker" as you "make" the price you want to buy/sell at and you therefore pay 0% fees.
Have a great day!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:52:02
Another good point, but i think he should at least have given credit/mentioned some of these fundamental differences between Bitcoin and something like Western Union.
I dont think anyone would say Western Union or Paypal is going to take over fiat :D
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:21:56
We will need cheaper transactions to make it truly effective.  Currently it will cost ~$10-20 to create a single channel (assuming you close it, eventually)
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:14:14
Yep, I use purely GDAX over Coinbase these days. Basically no reason to use Coinbase unless you enjoy paying fees :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:28:20
Yup, the small banks are hungry and want to steal market share whenever possible.  If the big boys don't want to play with Bitcoin, fine we will!
Also, notice how Goldman is doing Bitcoin futures for "some customers" AKA the ones they don't want to lose!
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:41:33
That i dont understand how it's a "much-wanted" dip when it has only been 3 days since we last saw this price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:26:03
The futures won't even have an effect on BTC price other than the emotional response from weak hands who panic sell.  Since the futures are settled in cash, they have zero connection to the BTC supply/demand or price.
It's just some guys on Wall Street betting on what we, the real BTC community, are doing with our coins.
Also yes, slightly cheaper coins was nice.

Why isn't Tim Cook allowed to hold Google stock? Because it's a conflict of interest?  If that's your reasoning, it is flawed because Roger is not the "CEO" of Bcash.  Also, as i said before, it's pretty silly to put all your eggs in one basket *even if you are "so" confident in something*.


If that's true, he'd have even more reason to have a diversified portfolio.


Yea i'm sure he would, the only reason he pushed for Bcash is he felt he had too.  If Bitcoin solved his perceived problems, he would probably drop Bcash in an instant.

You're starting to see why the big blockers say LN will result in centralization :)
You would probably connect to a big service provider, like PayPal, since they are reliable.
Or open more channels and pay more money to have more decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:13:20
You're probably going to get downvoted, but i agree with you.  We really need to address the fee situation now that we are facing a relatively massive influx of new users and Segwit adoption has proven slow (but GDAX upgrades tonight, so we'll see).
Proof is in the (mempool) pudding and honestly we really need to process more transactions, i dont think anyone can deny that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:41
Yup exactly, oh well - let the markets decide!

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:15
This really depends on Bitcoin on-chain fees as every LN channel requires an opening and closing tx on the blockchain, which costs money. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:53:48
Precisely.  He is certainly a talented speaker and can be eloquent in his own right.  Listening to him explain how Bitcoin can change financial systems with instant, cheap transactions is inspiring.
But then he starts his "After fees increase, Bitcoin lost marketshare" nonsense like a broken record and turns into a super ignorant speaker rather quickly.
PS: Roger if you are reading this for some crazy reason, when i say that the above is "nonsense" it's because you can't seriously attribute decrease in market share just to fees (especially for something people hodl and dont spend, but thats another convo...) when there are so many new technologies that can be built on blockchain.  It's like saying that IBM's prices were the reason that they lost market share in the "Internet" - it's just dumb, so many opportunities.

Crabcakes and Bitcoin baby, that's what Maryland does!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:41:12
Fair point, but i think Warren is missing some keys aspects of Bitcoin - namely how it functions as a distributed ledger and not a centralized system.  I also dont think he fully realizes how having decentralized trust means that we dont *need* to go in and out of fiat because we plan to replace it all together with a new world currency, backed by decentralized trust in each other.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:21:51
Or how about we find a middle ground instead, you do realize we can easily 10x block sizes without risking centralization.  Even doing 2x now would really help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:27:16
Ah well then i guess we will just disagree, but that's ok. I think that it wouldn't be very difficult to do a HF just to increase block size and most people would be on board given current mempool situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:31:24
Same here, no problems (yet)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:08:10
What gets me is that i don't understand why Coinbase didn't announce this in advance and give everyone a level playing field.  Saying they "told people not to talk" is a shit excuse, IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:49:51
Keynesian economics, eh?  You're correct that deflationary currency reduces spending, but only so far.  People don't decide to skip meals because their money may be worth more in the future (their pay will be worth more in the future as well, after all).
Yes, having a low inflation rate has **definitely** boosted our economy over the last century - however at what cost?  The growing wealth inequality in our nation is directly tied to this.  The poor and middle classes spend most of their income and barely invest in something that gives more than 2-3% return (beating inflation) so they always "lose" and spend to fuel the growing wealth of the rich.
Inflation is a tax on the poor and eliminates savings if not invested (which causes bubbles!).  Check out Austrian economics, its cool.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:53:17
We *do* know that a 4x increase can be handled by the majority of full nodes.  Its foolish to not pursue this.

I am very interested in a technical discussion!  First of all, thank you for not just downvoting me - i really enjoy having discussions and hate when people use downvotes instead of words.  One of my frustrations with this sub recently (and actually, we all downvote too much).
I don't have any proofs for this and really wish i did.  It makes sense though.  I see what you mean about those transactions being considered spam, and we probably could implement something to address the problem, but i am not aware of it yet.
I can definitely say that my upload rate was no where near this level a few months back.  Whenever blocks get full and fees increase, so does my upload rate - so i think its definitely more affected by mempool than overall blockchain size.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:45
But really, do you actually think there is some huge orchestrated attack going on versus people genuinely being unhappy with fees?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:07:58
from what, taking a shower or posting this comment?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:32:15
You mean we can use it for things?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:52:40
Yea for sure, I just want to ensure people understand that dynamic!
I also think we should double block size once LN shows promise to further reduce fees without going too crazy on blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:56:06

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:11:46
Fees suck, that is for sure - but how we go about solving it is the problem.  Roger has now stolen the name of Bitcoin in an effort to purposely confuse people, instead of being an adult and working to either help Bitcoin scale or create a new brand/coin.

This argument is kinda silly, do you really think any investor should put all his eggs in one basket?  Not trying to recite exactly what Roger said, i just honestly think it makes logical sense...
What if Core decides to increase block size once Roger sells his BTC and then BCH crashes?

Hey great comment, that's not a bad way of thinking about it.  It's honestly not ideal, but its not bad if you're a hodler haha.  I understand how the BTC is still yours and relatively safe once in the channel, so i guess its just a different place to "store" it.
I bet if we slightly increase block size it will *really* shine, tho

I'm right between you two!  There's definitely some downside, but i think the slippery slope argument isn't that great and going to like 8MB blocks would be enough to hold us over until layer 2 tech is ready.

Yea if you have the private key you own those coins.  The coins are never stored on your phone/pc/hardware wallet - you are simply storing the private keys to access them.  The coins themselves are on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:20:32
Bitcoin doesn't really have that mechanism in place - as a *feature* not a drawback, but there's nothing preventing someone like VISA from using blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, and still being an intermediary to provide those services.
Currently with Bitcoin, if you spend the money (send it to someone) then it is theirs and you have no "money-back" guarantee other than the integrity of that other person.

I mean my day job is not in programming, but like most of us I certainly understand it somewhat. I understand what you're saying and had the same thoughts about 3 months ago but not anymore. 
A 2-10x increase in block size would do very little to centralize mining or nodes yet would have a large effect on tx throughput. I can tell you that because I run my own node pretty easily at the moment.  Do the math for bandwidth, it is not difficult to download 10MB every 10 minutes on even the shittiest of internet connections.
Also I agree we need L2 technologies but they rely on cheap on-chain tx to work well. I am definitely not in the "let's scale to GB blocks" camp. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:22:12


No see, here's the thing.  It's **you** who has been misled and misinformed.  I 100% understand how increasing block size *can* lead to centralization as it gets more difficult to run a node.  I know this because i run my own node and have a firm understanding of how Bitcoin works, do you?
Why would the current block size, which was *randomly* selected a few years back to prevent spam, happen to magically be the most optimum for our growing network?  Increasing to 10MB blocks requires nodes to download 10MB every 10 minutes, which is NOT hard to do.  What IS hard to do, is run a node when the blocks are stupid full.  My uploads are off the chain (like 200 GB upload per day) due to the massive mempool.
I'm not saying we scale to 1 GB blocks, thats insane and would lead to centralization - but you seem to be very misinformed in terms of what size blocks would lead to centralization and now are fighting to keep fees high to benefit the miners.  Check your logic plz.

Alright how about this - what makes it "propoganda", exactly?  Would love to hear how you define that.
You are saying that correlation = causality with Roger spewing bullshit publicly and the number of "shills", but perhaps there is another cause that is driving *both* of those things.  What if that cause was the high fees and people genuinely were upset?  
How do the concerns not have logic?  Paying tens of dollars to make a transaction is pretty illogical if you ask me.  Increasing blocks a small amount is *not* dangerous and you can't blatently say people have "no thought" about the "danger" it brings.
Sorry for the mudslinging, that's a fair point :D

Yea he claims BCH is superior because he understands marketing and promotion and that "act" is required to push BCH into the spotlight. Obviously he favors BCH but I don't see how you make the jump to saying "he'd sell everything and put money in altcoins" as that doesn't make sense for a prudent, logical investor.
As much as he dislikes core, he knows it's going to go up in value because he is losing the BCH promotion race. He is therefore hedging his bets, it's really not complicated

Alright lets do this!
Public Key = Address  &lt;-- This is like an email address and is how you send Bitcoins around. 
Private Key = Super secret, paired with your public key using [cryptography](  Really cool if you have time to learn about it.  Don't ever, ever, ever give this away as it **literally** controls instant access to all coins sent to your Public Address from anywhere.
Account = Not a bitcoin term, per say, used by exchanges to represent the collection of coins you hold (like a bank account, sorta).
Your wallet should have a button for "Receiving" coins.  Click that and you should see a QR code and a string of letters/numbers below it (which is your Public Key or Address).  Enter that Address in the exchange to send the coins to your mycelium wallet.  Make sure the type of coin address you look at in mycelium (i.e Bitcoin, Litecoin etc.) matches the coin type you are sending from the exchange or you're gonna have a bad time.
PS - Make sure you have written down your recovery seed for your mycelium wallet in a super safe place, this is like your Private Key and also gives access to all of your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:38:33
No you are correct, also another plus is that with the Lightning Network (new upgrade coming soon) you will be able to instantly go between Bitcoin and Lightcoin with 0 fees (called an atomic swap).

For sure, but i honestly don't see how i could have a channel where i was doing dozens or hundreds of transactions.  Most of my channels would be 1-way (me sending money) and i wouldn't want to "pre-pay" a huge amount of money just to save on tx fees

I'm glad you didn't just start a pissing match with after he replied, but i 100% agree with his response to your above comment.  Blocksize increase would have an immediate effect and takes very little to implement.
Keep in mind there is a massive difference between supporting a block size increase to 2-10MB and saying "yea lets scale all the way to 1 GB". Most people here only want a small block increase to give Layer 2 technologies (and Segwit) more time to be developed.

I'm pretty sure he is informed on what happens when you expand block sizes.  He doesn't seem to be calling for "exponential" scaling of the block size and instead says we should just 4x it, which **would** have an immediate and large impact on fees.
A rare block size increase is VERY different from continuing to expand all the way up to 1 GB blocks, i don't think he or many of us want that.
It's not that hard to write the code, 2X was a pile of shit for other reasons.

1) Fuck Roger though, he totally could've done this without stealing the Bitcoin name.
2) Yea new users will, when i first saw how quickly i could send ETH from GDAX to my wallet it made me think a little.  Obviously ETH has some other drawbacks, but its just one example of relatively quick transactions (sans cryptokitties).

This isn't true, Segwit can be used by any wallet.  Just because no software wallets (free wallets) don't have it yet doesn't mean its impossible.
It takes time and resources to develop so it will take a while to make its way to a free wallet versus something like Ledger which is in huge demand (and paid for).

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:27
I see what you mean, but this place has gotten super hostile towards anyone who voices a slightly negative or contrarian opinion on Bitcoin.  I understand that is probably because everyone is a bit "trigger happy" from all of the BCH attacks, but still it hinders good discussion.
I would also say that Bitcoin is *not* doing just fine.  Fees have rendered it super broken and i dont think anyone can deny that (but they do).  To me, when someone denies that fees aren't at all a problem it makes me think they are not facing reality or are shilling a narrative.
Not trying to attack you at all, just how i see things and trying to explain.

Going from 1MB to 4MB will hardly impact decentralization at *all*.  Do the math if you don't believe me.
1 MB = 8Mb over 10 minutes, meaning you need 0.013 Mbps internet at a minimum.  4x that is only .05 Mbps, so i think we'll be ok :)
Also, storage is cheap.

Ahh yea i think i wasn't very clear - i mean that *eventually* you will be able to make a Segwit transaction once they add Segwit support to their software.
So it *can* be used by any wallet, but they need to actually implement it.  And you're correct, you can't make a Segwit tx if your wallet doesn't support it.

It slows down once the high fees tx are cleared since the amount of money from mining a block in fees will also decrease, but yea this is good.

Nice, little Pro Tip tho - Elon Hates Acronyms (EHA) so it would be best to spell out Bitcoin to make it super clear!
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:45:04
Bitcoin transactions take an hour because you typically need 6 blocks to confirm (which are ~10 minutes on BTC).  So if you have 2 hour blocks, it may take 12 hours for it to go through.
Also the idea of using a blockchain with one incredibly dominate mystery miner kind of scares me, regardless of where that blockchain came from.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:00:47
Fair point, but who said they *had* to be anonymous?
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:09:06
As says "open channels full of BTC to what you believe will be popular destinations"
So basically the more channels (and the larger) you have, the more business your LN hub will get.  This leads to a snowball effect where large hubs get more and more traffic and can scale larger and larger, leading to centralization.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:37:03
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:49:48
Because that's what we're trying to do with Bitcoin, Peer to Peer - not VISA on blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:13:52
I agree, but you don't have 50 checking accounts do you?  No, maybe a few of them - which will go to companies like VISA, Mastercard anndd perhaps another...maybe....Blockstream? :P
Ninjy Edit: Also, i imagine companies like VISA will take this even further and offer you CREDIT in that payment channel (imagine that) which makes it even more enticing to use them for purchases!
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:53:00

So like, 90% of the people who've gotten into BTC over the last month?
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:07:03
No offense, but I don't think you fully understand how a LN hub would work.  If i had to open a LN channel to a merchant just to pay them once and then close it, you didn't even use the LN at all.  Other wise, do you just leave channels open with these merchants (and tie up money) perpetually because one day you *might* buy from them?
No - it leads to things like VISA or Mastercard saying "hey bro, ill hold channels with them for you and then you just worry about having one open channel, to me (VISA)" which is centralization.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:19:24
Sorry I should have been more clear, you are correct that ROI scales but one thing that is missing is number of payment options. When you have more capital, you can create more channels with different destinations. This gives your customers more flexibility in where they can send money and therefore makes you more attractive. 
So basically when you have more money, you become more attractive by offering more destinations for payments. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:05:29
Yea i'm not claiming to have all the answers or trying to attack Segwit/LN (i'm not a shill, i swear).  I'm just truly on the fence about which of these approaches (big blocks vs LN) will result in more centralization.

Well we don't need opinions, EDA has rules that are known - if you fail to mine 6 blocks in 12 hours (ish), then you get a 20% difficulty reduction.  The difficulty is currently 13% of what it was originally after multiple EDA activations and the regular increases.
One dude ("Other") will continue to mine at least 6 blocks in 12 hours to prevent EDA and has been doing so for a while.

Oh it takes very little energy to run, but you will have zero transactions until you open payment channels (with tied up BTC) to destinations in *hopes* that someone uses your hub.  So the cost comes from having open payment channels.

Ya i was half-joking, but i do think that Bitcoin is more attractive to people who have gambling personality styles.

Lol that would be *hilarious* if they arrested him since he claimed to be Satoshi
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:08:58
For sure, and i'm not saying you'd *have* to - just that this could be a potential service that uses super super cheap LN transactions + current benefits of something like VISA (having credit)
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:32:59
Yes absolutely nothing, just most of it's code, but other than that it's nothing.

While i agree, lets play devils advocate for a second - why does land have inherit value?  I'd say because it's an obviously limited resource (the main source of the "inherit value" statement) but also (and very importantly) because people WANT it.  
What if in 100 years everyone decided that land was for poor people and space was what you wanted, real estate prices could plummet!
That won't happen because its pretty much guaranteed that people will always want land, but my point is that something only has the value that people choose to place in it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:07:36
You're half correct - think about fees for a second.  You are right that everyone will compete and drive fees down since the entry cost to start a LN hub is marginal, **however** think about the ROI on the money you must tie up in Time Lock Contracts.  To get the best ROI on that "tied up money" you would want to maximize the "turns" on it, or basically use it as much as possible - AKA have tons of LN Tx's through your hub.
What this means is that the largest LN hub will be able to offer the lowest fees and crowd others out of the market.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:04:09
...too distracted by your username...but EDA only works if those pesky miners stop mining so many blocks even though it's not profitable.  Huge risk is if that mystery miner ("Other") suddenly stops when the coin is already not profitable to mine, could take a while to become profitable.

If you give someone your 2FA codes, it's hardly the exchanges fault.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:14:00
That's great that'd you'd run a hub, but how many people will tie up funds with you to have a LN channel open all the time? Unless you are doing frequent transactions with someone, I'd say not too many. 
This is what leads to centralization with LN, the fact that people will only have open payment channels with a few parties - and naturally those parties will be the ones who offer the most recipient options (AKA large hubs). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:10:02
Yea i honestly see this whole thing the same way as when you try to use a spreadsheet/SQL query/piece of code that someone else made and you frankly have no real good understanding of how it works, but times a million.

I was worried this was a bad example, it's similar but not actually the same even with electricity prices and such because *Bitcoin miners are not creating more coins*.  Sure, they are rewarded with the block reward if they find a block - **but** that is a controlled rate (1 block per 10 minutes) that does not change based on price.  The block reward is also controlled in a steady manner (decreasing over time).
If a miner stops mining because electricity costs too much, the difficulty will adjust to hit that 1 block per 10 minute rate.  Thus the creation of new coins is not affected by price, it follows rules laid out by the All Mighty Satoshi himself.

No, it's NOT an indicator - it can easily be [manipulated]( unlike other indicators (like price history) which are set in stone.

So how about this - Say you were in 1997, are you telling me that you would *not* buy Apple stock because it was in a bubble?  Even in 2004, at the peak of the dotcom bubble, Apple sold for ~$5/share, you wouldn't buy?
Today Apple is worth $169/share, but including the stock splits it's the equivalent of $2366/share.  
Don't neglect an entire industry or technology just because of rapid growth, even if slightly overvalued in the short term.

Wow, he was able to articulate something that I've thought about but have never been able to verbalize quite so eloquently.  
I used to work in the Gold mining industry and can tell you that with other commodities, including gold, *everything* was based on the current and forecasted price for that item.  We used "cut-off grades" to determine the amount of gold reserves in the ground which was totally based on cost of mining and the gold price.  If gold price went up, our reserves/supply of gold also went up and vice-versa.  
Bitcoin does not have this.  The only "supply response", as Novo states, is people with weak hands selling!

Nice info, thanks!  Yea i was definitely making a generalization and perhaps could've been more specific.

@_date: 2017-11-02 02:57:27
The CME futures announcement is mainstream adoption.  New people likely use coinbase and institutional money doesn't use local bitcoins, so that could explain that part.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:24:16
Yea! In gold mining, more mines open and the rate of gold coming out actually increases.  With Bitcoin, more "mines" open but the rate of coins coming out stays the same (they just fight over them hah)
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:18:58
Looking at the order book (buy and sell orders) is not really a good indicator of what price will do. People can easily fake things and cancel an order before it actually triggers (and they do) to manipulate the market.

For any n00bs wondering about why this is a scam - if you put money in this address (left side of wallet), the seller of the wallet (and the entire world) already have your private key and can steal all your money (seen on right side of the wallet).

@_date: 2017-11-09 17:30:20
It depends on your account and verification levels for the bank account, thus they say "variable".  If you've done the proper verification and waited a few weeks(?), i believe the limit should be $10K.  Can be much lower for new/unverified accounts.

I believe OP's point is that you can get a sense for how difficult it is to move money from USD to CNY by looking at how large the price difference is.  If it were easy to convert (i.e free flow of capital) then there wouldn't be much of an arbitrage opportunity like you see now.

You need to do it on your router, depends on what you have.  For me, i can go in the App (OnHub) and enter a specific port to forward.  Your ISP may also have that port blocked which may require adjusting your modem or calling the ISP (extreme cases).

Yes, larger blocks make it harder to host a node (queue Craig Wright "fuck off" comments), but there is a tradeoff between amazing decentralization and scale.  Bitcoin used to be amazingly decentralized because it didn't require much at small scale.  Now that we are *rapidly* growing up, we need more room for transactions.
We all are hoping that SegWit and things like Lightning Network will do that, but honestly it seems like we may need to expand the main network (larger blocks) as well to handle the MASSIVE scale we still have down the road.  Don't forget, Bitcoin is still super super tiny compared to things like the USD.

Why did you divide by 100?  If you consistently do that, it has no impact?

...they are worth the same regardless of how you acquired them.  Do you know how many you had?
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:26:03
But dollar amount doesn't really matter, ROI (%) is what you should be looking at and therefore dividing by 100 doesn't really affect that (besides tx fees being a larger factor).

Everyone wants Bitcoin to be faster, and most want lower fees - but we can't agree on how to get there.  The main problem is that demand for bitcoin transactions is increasing much more rapidly than the supply of available transactions (block size and lack of 2nd layer).
Segwit is the popular upgrade to the Bitcoin code and will fix small issues with the current protocol (transaction malleability) while also enabling future technologies, like the Lightning Network.  The Lightning Network should theoretically enable massive capacity for cheap (like, dirt cheap) transactions *however* those transactions would **not** take place on the bitcoin blockchain - rather they would be located on a "2nd layer" off chain.  This means that Lightning Network transactions wouldn't pay fees to miners, rather the *much* lower fees would go to a different service provider (who isn't spending energy on cryptographic puzzles all day)
This means that you are getting away from the fundamentals of what makes Bitcoin awesome (cryptography and security) and also means that the miners will not receive as much income from transactions fees, since there would be less demand for the regular on-chain transactions.  The miners are therefore opposed to this and say that we should, instead, simply increase the block size so we can jam more transactions in each block - which should reduce fees (more supply).  The miners would also get 100% of the fees from all transactions, since there wouldn't be any 2nd Layer stealing their business!
So essentially, most users want segwit and LN for the amazingness it contains (myself included) and most miners want to just increase block size so they can keep the fees for themselves and not lose business.  We can't agree one way or another, so Segwit2x kinda says "Heh, fuck it - let's do both!"
Hope that helps
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:20:39
The miners could compete, but it's competing in a race to the bottom (cheap prices) - it would be better for them to just block the 2nd layer from ever existing in the first place, which they have been trying to do. 
The large miners don't use CPU/GPUs for mining, not if they're serious at least, they use purpose built ASICs and have millions invested in that hardware.

Depends on what you want, a full node with a Bitcoin node running is a bit tricky but running a lightning wallet with a light client like neutrino is fairly easy. 
To do the latter, download the Lightning Network App and then fund it with a BTC transaction and you're good to go (autopilot is on by default for channel creation).

Hard to say who's winning - since the miners have so much hashing power they can dominate the current voting process (signaling when mining blocks) so they have lots of control.  Segwit2x is very close to activating (needs 80% of votes over a certain period) and would give us Segwit with a block size increase as well.
The 2nd layer is going to enable transactions using regular computers, like what you have, so there will be tons of people trying to get in on that market.  It won't require millions of investment on mining equipment and therefor will be incredibly price competitive.  I suppose miners could get in on that action, and likely will, but it would really hurt their current business which they've invested heavily into.
