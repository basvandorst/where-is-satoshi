Thanks, but this seems more like a "workaround" and not the "send BTC into card wallet and spend fiat anywhere Visa/Mastercard is accepted" kinda deal I was thinking about.

I was going to sell my Apple shares soon anyway, but their recent actions have re-confirmed my stance. Their growth is slowing down fast and I just don't see them coming up with a "revolutionary" product anytime soon.

Very positive development in my opinion. Some regulation is better than an all out ban on exchanges.

Since this person has already put in so much work (kudos btw), I think it would be logical for him to pivot and dedicate the site to promoting the currently adopted Bitcoin symbol. Other sites, designers and media can benefit from having such a valuable resource.

Get a real job, buy BTC regularly with 2-5% of your salary. You'll be fine. The entrepreneur route is riskier than Bitcoin, most startups fail.

When the dust settles, the price will continue it's long-term trend. When it hits all time highs, there are always people who look back at opportunities they had to buy low. This might be one of those.

As someone posted here a few weeks ago, it's a lose lose proposition. No one will thank you if they gain a lot but everyone will be pissed if they lose even a penny. An they'll constantly nag you for advise every time the price drops.

You're right in that I did miss part of his point and I didn't mean to sound condescending or anything. But my response still applies to his point regarding hashing of documents, which is over time the "other" value of bitcoin network will become apparent.

Ditto. It's either coinbase if you're willing to link and verify your bank account or localbitcoins.com if you'd rather purchase with cash or other payment methods (they have an escrow, so it's pretty safe).
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:20:15
Do you understand exactly how the internet works? Or the keyboard you're typing on, or the monitor you're looking at? But, you're still using it without thinking much about it. People don't necessarily need to know the inner-workings of bitcoin, just the high level details of how to create a wallet, buy/sell/transfer bitcoins. With time, these things will become much easier and as second nature as sending an email.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:10:02
I'm down roughly the same amount. It sucks, but I'm in it for the long haul. IMO, these booms and busts are part of the game and maybe it's a feature of the design. If there wasn't anything exciting going on with bitcoin, the media wouldn't care to report on it and people in turn wouldn't learn about it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:20:32
Dozens and dozens!
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:33:06
Maybe everyone who signed up during the last run up can finally buy some now. Coinbase also makes you wait about 10 days to buy more after your first purchase. So if someone cautiously bought .1 btc and wanted to buy more on the drop, they would have to wait..
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:24:14
Does Electrum or Multibit allow for paper backups?

Dear people of china, just hold your BTC. One day you'll figure out a way to cash them in ;)
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:31:49
I'm guessing your business model is similar to fiverr.com, which of course has many other competitors. I don't think bitcoin is the problem (or a solution) in your case. Generally with these types of marketplaces, it's usually a "chicken and egg" problem.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:05:27

I'm guessing that the price dropping for the past two weeks has something to do with it. If people bought it for more than what it's currently worth, they're less likely to spend it (or sell it) hoping for the price to bounce back up.
Edit: But don't be discouraged. It's people like you that are helping take bitcoin into mainstream adoption. Keep it up!
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:23:45
Sidebar is the best place to start ^~~~~~~~~~~&gt; 
Edit: And if you're in the US, coinbase.com for buying online (have to link your bank account and other ID verification required), or localbitcoins.com for buying locally or online depending on the payment methods.

I'm speaking from first hand experience and many here will agree. It's a natural human psychology. I do love Bitcoin and what it represents and I do still tell friends about it. But I try to be careful as to not let my excitement be taken for an advice to invest too much. I try to inform and educate more than give investment advice.
