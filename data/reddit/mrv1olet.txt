No. How much do you have in there? If it's a substantial amount - there's a few services that crack wallets for a fee. If not - you're better off forgetting about it.

Well, here's a joke for yall. There was a man with a 25in. penis and man had a very "difficult life" because of it. One day his father tells him "Listen son. There is a magical pond and in this magical pond is a magical frog, ask this magical frog if he would like to marry you and everytime he says no, the legend says that your penis will shrink about 5in." So this man traveled off to find this magical frog, after long time searching he finally finds it. The man then yells "MAGICAL FROG! WILL YOU MARRY ME!?" The frog is very confused and yells back "...No!" Suddenly the man feels a shortage in his pants and realizes that his wand has shrunkin 5in. Excited he yells out again. "MAGICAL FROG! MAGICAL FROG! WILL YOU MARRY ME!?!" Annoyed frog yells out "No god damnit!" Again another 5in. shrinks from the man's penis. Happy, the man thinks to himself "just one more time and I'll be perfect." The man yells out "MAGICAL FROG! MAGICAL FROG! WILL YOU MARRY ME!?!?" Well, the frog turns to him and yells out " NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! F**KING DAMMIT I SAID NO!"

Talk to the support? Besides that, try using larger exchanges - coinbase, bitcoin, kraken et cetera. It might be a bit slower, but I wouldnt post my bank info on some shady website.

The wallet contains exactly 0.02729968BTC. It's not much, but a lot more than I make in a week.

UPD: The money are still there. 
And Ive forgot something important:
Here's my address for whoever gets there first.

Because my recorded passwords do not match to backups - and I can't see another solution but to ask for help.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:00:00
Yes, it is an HD wallet, but the address above is not related to the lost wallet. Plus as far as I understand, wallet.dat itself is enough to get access.

Most of exchanges will ask for your bank info, thus deanonymizing you and ruining half the fun. Coinbase and Kraken are another two options to look into

I indeed am. And I'm afraid people just won't bother(
