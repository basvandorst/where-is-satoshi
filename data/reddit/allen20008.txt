Have a go at explaining then ;) In the end, nobody knows what's going to happen - my post was simply one suggestion.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:39:04
Hey, fellow Canadian here. May I asked how you sold the 100k worth? Through what exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:00:27
So what? This has nothing to do with bitcoin. Stop focusing on Bitcoin Cash, focus on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:18:43
I hate to be blunt but that is 100% incorrect.
It will never be linear, it should be obvious that as market cap grows, higher prices will be harder to obtain.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:37:14
Thanks for contributing to the bitcoin community!
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:52:54
I hate to argue with random internet strangers but...
I am the farthest thing from a bcash supporter lol. I'm competent enough to not bash them upfront, and rather, support the coin of my choice by spreading the word and making proper arguments as to why it is a better choice than bitcoin cash.
I've been in bitcoin since 2013 and have directly referred over a hundred people.
And I just don't think that focusing on the negatives of another project will help us all that much.

Got to compile all my bitcoin into one address today, paid a 53 satoshi fee, confirmed in ~2 hours. I want to say awesome but I know that the bitcoin cash supporters will be like "you call THAT awesome? Blockstream scum", so I'll just call it great progress. :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:01:46
So we need to contact these exchanges and get them to do it. This is a huge problem and bitcoin will not prevail unless the community comes together and voices what we want

They are pretty cool, but still in development.

You're essentially calling btc useless... In which i'll have to disagree
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:10:16
I use bitcointalk.org mainly.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:49:24
If we don't change how we approach bitcoin, it'll be the same for every single cryptocurrency. We just don't see it right now because their prices aren't that high, they don't have that many people in the game right now.
Once they reach the market cap of bitcoin, I can guarantee you that the greed will be there. The community will yet again split. It's just fucking sad, we have something great here, and it's being pulled down not by external sources, but rather, the internal community.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:45:38
Does price fully determine the usefulness of bitcoin? Bitcoin has the same functionality whether its $1000 or $10000.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:37:21
This WILL happen soon. History combined with logic dictates this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:56:13
You're right. There are good people in every bad situation.
However, I've been in the bitcoin community since early 2013, and I can tell you for a fact that through my personal experience, the community, in ALL aspects, has greatly declined in quality.
More greed and less "togetherness". Of course, this is me complaining about the inevitable but I think it's still something worth saying. Maybe posts like these will help.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:21:46
Not because of that. Just personal opinion, but from the interviews I've seen he seems to carry a very big ego.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:56:26
This is me exactly. I started telling people about bitcoin over 4 years ago, and after the 2013 crash, these where the most common phrases used:
'But bitcoin is illegal!'
'It's for drug money'
'It's in a bubble'
'Bitcoin is banned'
Same guys are now making accounts on coinbase today and asking how to go over the $100 weekly limit.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:39:29
Are you going to base your investment strategy off everyone else's opinion?
If I were you, I'd take the time to form my own.
Good luck!

Bittrex is literally acamming its users right now. Please do not use under any circumstance.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:02:37
haha, thanks. However, I believe that this problem is on both sides. Just ranting a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:32:11
Used a nonsegwit address, sent a $15k transaction today for only 60 satoshis per byte.
Only took 8 minutes. Was I extremely lucky or is this a regular occurence? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:32:17
Watch your word choice ;)
Maybe you mean no "free" coins. Definetly not lower value.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:55:22
Jamie is literally going to destroy JP Morgan.
Their future outlook is not looking good.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:52:45
I'm in your position exactly. I guess I "made" profit too since I've been and still am a long-term holder.
We bitcoin evangelists "advertised" bitcoin as the "good" in the world of currency, a decentralized saviour of sorts. I can't count how many people I've brought into bitcoin. I think I've done my fair share of the work, and will continue to do so.
But what do I tell these people now? Bitcoin, AND Bitcoin Cash, is corrupt in their own way. And the problem is being exemplified by the community.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:44:48
It'll be very hard to achieve mass adoption.  Some people just love restricting others.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:20:21
I still remember when it was $300 and jumped by $20. Man that was pretty exciting back then.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:58:18
Take my upvote. You should have gotten more. :/
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:40:05
The people who say bitcoin has no use either have not used bitcoin, don't understand what bitcoin actually is (I have friends who think it's just a wallet system, like PayPal) or are just following the bad media.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:30:03
Well said sir, well said.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:36:52
AFAIK, there are currently only a couple of offline businesses that accept bitcoin. (in comparison to the business that don't accept bitcoin). The number one problem is that most business owners don't really know what bitcoin is...
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:35:16
You are confusing price with value.
Value: the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:44:02
You can't. You need a message and address in order to verify.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:04:53
I know you said preferably no hardware wallets but I have to put in a good word for the trezor wallet. It's amazing and has kept my bitcoins and my clients bitcoins secure since 2014.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:48:09
No, you didn't follow the advice. What happened to investing only what you could afford to lose?
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:42:58
That would suck but that is why there is the 24 word recovery seed. :) so you will be able to restore the wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:57:06
Are you kidding about bitcoin to the moon or Tai mentioning bitcoin on his story?
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:32:53
Like satoshi said, either a lot or nothing.
We are still in the early stages but I see cryptos having a bright future. Which specific crypto,? I'm uncertain.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:12:41
Thanks! We actually just received some samples and they turned out great (so damn comfortable right now). We are using [Direct to Garment printing](
Which designs, specifically, seem to thin?
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:40:07
I don't know. However, I am very sure that it has growth potential. I'm also a firm believer of bitcoin. I hold onto both coins, usually at around 60 or 70% bitcoin and 30 or 40% ethereum.

The clarity is great but should be expected of all organizations. Just hoping that more announcements follow from other companies because from what I can see, a LOT of normal users do not know what is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:01:31
Yeah. Honestly I think they are just operating well under their current system and see no reason to change. That's most probably because they don't really understand the benefits to using a decentralized cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:47:22
Thanks, man. They come in a plastic bag, in a box. It's pretty compact packaging :)

Sorry to hear that, that's horrible. But 89, hopefully he lived a fullfilling life.
However, I believe you have more than enough money to cover for the funeral expenses? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:50:54
I can cover the rest. However, I see that that wallet has no bitcoins in it. Why wouldn't you want us to send the bitcoins to your current address that is short $1.11?
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:53:20
Why dont you just share the address with your current holdings?
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:42:02

However, I believe you have more than enough money to cover for the funeral expenses? Surely you can cashout some of your coins to pay for your dad's funeral.

Funnily enough, I'm actually working to create a crypto lifestyle apparel brand, selling clothing and accessories. Didn't see any around, so I worked with some people to make one to create some cool stuff that people can wear without looking like a complete crypto nerd (which is totally cool as well, btw)
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:02:38
If you are looking for something special, it's always worth posting on forums (e.g. bitcointalk) or marketplaces on what you're looking for, and then pay in bitcoin.
If you're looking for online stores only, could you be a little more specific in what items you are looking to purchase?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:22:56
99.8% of the people are in it for the money lol

Thanks! We just thought that sweatshirts and hoodies were more versatile. Which designs are you talking about specifically?
