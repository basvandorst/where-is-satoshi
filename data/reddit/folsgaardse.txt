No but sold everything I had left and waiting to buy back in.  
IF there is another 18k I may have lost a lot of potential but I still doubled my money this swing and that is enough.
I feel after this pump it will go back down.  Not sure when, but I'm a long term player, might take a month or 6 to re-enter the market.

Agree.  Sounds nice till you factor in million in hardware cost that deprecate pretty quickly and insane power bills.

How is buying at peak ever a good time to buy?
Buy low, sell high.  This is not low, this is 2x what low was.

This recent pump is BECAUSE of the trade war.  
China is the big whales of Bitcoin, when things go awry people in China turn to Bitcoin.  Happened last time during the pump to 19k

You mean the sub $100 days.

Bought at $200-250 sold at $18k been following the market since 2013.  Not an expert but just sharing my gut instinct.  This is another pump.  We've had several of them.

People buying now are the people who lose money.
That's how trading works.  It may go higher, but honestly this is a pump, it's gonna drop probably back to 3500-4k.

No,  I wouldnt even buy now.  
Buy low, sell high,  time to sell now and buy back later.

IMHO I would convert to smaller altcoins and trade on those markets.  Years ago I went from .5 btc to 3 BTC just trading dogecoin/blackcoin/mintcoin (mostly doge though)
If you like trading

I still doubled my money.  Lost potential but still made 100% profit.

By low I mean the most recent stabilization.  It's been around 3500-4k for a long time now and amazingly stable at that price.
I bought at 200-250 and sold at 18k.
I figure it might get up to 9k but I dont wait for peaks I wait for what I feel is a comfortable profit and take it.
Sell now, buy back later at 3500-4k and double your BTC holding for free.
Wait for next economic turmoil, people in China get scared and buy Bitcoin.  There is a pump, sell again.
Rinse and repeat.
Nothing is guaranteed and I may be wrong.  Just expressing my gut feeling from years of market watching and analytics.

Personally I do not.  This IMHO is a reflex by the Chinese after the last round of tariff talks.
It will go  back to 3500-4k again.   I do not know peak, maybe 9k?  But I'm selling now and buying back at 3800

I have no real way to gauge the strength of this pump or how long that it will last.
I'm just focusing the fact its higher now than and will drop later.  This was my comfort level to sell.

Your logic is sound.
