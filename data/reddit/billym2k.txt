Best of luck Kyle :D
BTW, I dunno about raising 6k, but if you just want to make a dogecoin address, I can ask our community to throw a few ...Well, cents toward the cause, or whatever they want! Blockchain getting thrown off the apple store is a wake up call IMO to all cryptocurrency communities.

Like an above post said, a community is really just a loose collection of all sorts of people. I try to help set a tone but people of course do what they want! I don't enjoy having to make a post like that repeatedly but I do believe it's for a minority rather than the majority.
But yeah anyhoo, come back anytime if you are compelled to do so :D

If it means anything to you, I made this post: 
This isn't an appeal to come back or not, just that some of the reaction to that tweet and some of the behavior of the community has bugged me as well, especially anti-bitcoin talk, I'm a bitcoiner too :P

Well, I agree that capital gains tax would be more fair, if it was purchased and sold after a year, just like a stock. Just stating the law, though.

haha yeah :) it's weird how i got so much more twitchy when it goes up in value, and whenever it dips it felt like 'well duh'... yet I was wrong every time!

Yeah, any losses (and this is all from purchase price - sell price) can be removed from the amount of gains when it is declared. So the IRS only wants to tax your overall actual gain.

I think this sums up 'how I really feel if I think about it" pretty well :) The weirdest thing about bitcoin is how it doesn't really scale all that well in its current incarnation -- with the mania and influx of transactions, transaction times have gotten pretty bogged down, which isn't particularly user friendly... Like, intuitively the speculation far surpasses its adoption and in some ways its current utility...
But then, can't bet against it :)
Seems like we are in for quite a ride!

Man that's awesome, good for you for buying and holding :)

This is probably unpopular, but it is good to know for first time purchasers and sellers of bitcoins, they are not considered "investments" by the IRS, so earnings do not qualify for "capital gains" tax. Any earnings from selling bitcoin would need to be declared as income.
This is especially important as companies like coinbase/bitstamp require you to put all your info in before they sell to you -- if they are cooperating with the IRS, you better as well!

I bought a VPS for a month from  , only .02 bitcoin!
Also did some gambling on 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:38:57
OP, when did you buy, and when did your order get cancelled?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:25:38
i think that's good advice :) i have a set of them that i consider "keep until a horribly rainy day" and another set of them in the "buy and sell" fund.
the keep until a rainy day fund is doing much better xD
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:19:00
yes to both

Has anyone used bit.gg? I just went to the site and used their calculator and the math seems totally off. A .01 bet to win would get 3 bitcoins, a .01 bet to lose would get .3 bitcoins ??
Is it a scam or just a bad math algorithm...?
