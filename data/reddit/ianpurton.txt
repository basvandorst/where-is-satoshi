A very impressive write up and something I've seen happening in the Bitcoin space too. For example chain.com flipped from Bitcoin API to Blockchain company.
However if you are a small indy developer who's not great at raising funding, or just can't be arsed. Then it's great watching the well funded companies pursue the blockchain dream.
In the mean time you can provide real services to real customers.

Not really anonymous at all because you need a bank account to send or receive Fiat.
But still an impressive product and protocol and I hope this is a great success.

It has been thought about and it's a hard problem to solve. For example you could choose a random full node to receive part of the block reward. But how could you validate the node is actually a full node ?
It makes sense for miners to run full nodes so they can be sure they create correct blocks to get accepted. Also various bitcoin businesses should run full nodes to avoid the risk that they get incorrect dta etc.

It's possible using trusted oracles. Basically you use m of n transactions and the oracle or oracles sign off if they agree.

It's a client side wallet, so no server install required. Unless you're talking about Insight which is the backend for this ?

**Here's how I think all this will work.**
E.g. Lloyds bank customer want's to send money to Santandar customer in Euros.
* Lloyds creates a bitcoin transaction for the minimum fee.
* They use OP_RETURN which is a way of putting a message in a transaction. i.e. send 100EUR to IBAN XXX
* The transaction is signed with the Lloyds private key
* The transaction is sent to a Santandar Bitcoin public key
Now at the end of the day Santandar and Lloyds can see on the blockchain who owes what to whom. 
This I believe is cheaper for the banks (assuming all banks get on board) than using the existing mechanisms (Swift).
It's pretty simple really.
You can use the same mechanism to keep customer balances. This would be useful for bitcoin exchange software.
**Will they use the Bitcoin blockchain?**
I think so. We have a lot of infrastructure in place and the most powerful network. I suspect the early adopters of Blockchain as a ledger technology will come out of the Bitcoin space anyway.

**Why does the Grexit matter to Bitcoin?**
* Greece needs to pay it's pensioners and it currently has no money. There is a fear they will implement capital controls, which effectively means they will take money from peoples bank accounts. Bitcoin is immune to capital controls.
* Some people fear the Euro will tank and savings will be devalued across Europe.
* It's possible some of the main banks are holding leveraged positions in Greek bonds. Some analysts predict another credit crunch style scenario.
If you are investor and you think the above is likely to happen you will look to get your money out of the Euro. Here are some options.
* Short the Euro
* Short Greek bonds
* Take a chance on the volatile new crypto currency Bitcoin
In my opinion this is what Bitcoin adoption is about. Bitcoin is an alternative store of value, and effectively a short of the current financial system.

CoinBase is classified as a money transmitter so they have to go through KYC (Know your customer) processes.
Probably depending on location they may have to give information to the regulators. i.e. this user transferred &gt; $10,000.

It's actually a split wallet, one key in the wallet another on the android phone. Both keys are needed to create transactions.
The problem with the bither method is that you need multiple QR codes to sign the transaction.

Yes. And Ripple has a head start in this space. If Bitcoin is to get a competitive edge we would need to see some well funded startups join in.
 
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:44:12
If you have your savings in Euros then Bitcoin starts to look more and more desirable.
Firstly, in Greece if capital controls are implemented then you could lose some of your savings.
Secondly, if Greece exists, the Euro might take a hit and it's already trading pretty low.
So a safe bet for any savvy investor would be to hold some savings in Bitcoin as it's immune from capital controls.

The advantage over an existing ledger or database is the ledger immutability.
This is the big sell for blockchain technology at the moment and probably why ripple is making inroads into the banks.

Yes, but then it's not a ledger anymore. They need somewhere to store the account activity.

If you look at the onchain app (which is used by carbonwallet), it could post an xpub to your service by scanning a QR code. 
As the onchain app will also sign TX's the user wouldn't need to use electrum to spend.

Hi Chris,
Looks great. This is something I am also currently developing but you are further along than me.
I run a web wallet, as I see it, this is currently peer to peer. Any chance of also supporting web wallets ? 
Something like.
1. I generate a QR code for a master key request. (Similar to the video) My QR code contains a POST back URL. You generate a master key and HTTP POST it to me.
2. When I want a transaction signed I generate a QR code with the TX in it. You sign it and send it back in the same way.
3. I broadcast it.
You should call it 2FS, 2 factor signing, people have to realise this is far more secure 2FA.
@_date: 2014-12-29 11:46:40
If someone steals your mobile. They would not have access to the passphrase you use to decrypt the server side key during payments. 
An attacker needs 2 keys to steal your coins. So basically.
1. An attack on our servers only reveals 1 key, and even then the attacker has to be able to brute force your passphrase. With a decent passphrase this is currently very difficult.  We select a completely random 64bit password for the user. (Generated in the browser.)
2. If an attacker steals your phone, again they only have 1 key. If you have a PIN on your home screen you could slow down this attack. With some phones you could remotely wipe the phone.
3. We use BIT ID, we are not storing emails/password. It's very anonymous. If our server is attacked, we don't have any information to reveal where or who you are.

If it's really a Turing-complete scripting language, then I could create a transaction that goes into an endless loop and bring the network down.
There's a reason why Bitcoins scripting language is restricted. It's restricted for security reasons. Also what incentive do miners have to run everyones scripts ? none. 
Everything you can do with Ethereum you can do with bitcoin using multi sig and oracles right now.

Hi. Good look with this.
I had some thoughts about passphrase backup as I've been looking at this for some other projects.
One thing that would be really cool, that no one else does, is to print off a QR code of you passphrase to a nearby printer.
Sort of like a paper wallet. You could then scan the QR code to reload the private key. Not sure hopw to do this exactly android does support printing.

Well let's say for example you own a mining pool with 3 owners. You create a 2 of 3 multi sig address on onchain. 
Each time the mining software needs to create a payout it creates a text file with say bitcoin addresses and amounts to pay. This gets uploaded to onchain and onchain creates an unsigned TX.
2 of the 3 owners can check the address and sign it if they are happy.

Yes. 
BIT ID for authentication and registration. This has been around for a while but has not been picked up widely. 
And then split keys, or more specifically multi signature transactions. We're the only wallet AFAIK splitting a multi sig key out to your mobile phone.

We've fixed Bitcoin and found a way to give coin holders interest on their coins.

Here's what I would recommend, I've been developing Bitcoin stuff since 2011, over 300k blocks ago.
* Android development - Java (You don't really get a choice.)
* iOS - Swift, I would not bother with Objective C, go straight to the new kid on the block.
* Web Development - Ruby on Rails. Coinbase and Strongcoin are both built on the rails platform.
Don't bother interfacing with Bticoind, use chain.com, much easier.

I'm no expert on GreenAddress (GA) so they may want to correct me if I'm wrong. But here is how I see the comparison.
Both are 2 of 2 Multi Sig. However we keep no keys, GA keeps 1 key. This is problematic as GA could 'freeze' funds. This could happen for example for legal reasons. CarbonWallet cannot freeze your funds.
GA could grab the key kept at your browser using a javascript injection. This would give them both keys and the ability to spend your funds. It should be noted that between most web wallets and then end user there are multiple opportunities to inject JavaScript. This could be done by a 3rd party company for example cloudfront which is used by most wallet for DDOS protection.
GA uses the mobile network for 2FA. This could cause issues as 2FA can be bypassed using social engineering. i.e. voice mail redirects.
GA is a great product, and though I am biased, I personally think CarbonWallet is a better solution because we are splitting keys across devices.
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:36:58
Yes. Because the POW element means you have to wait about 10 minutes to send a message.

Hi, Can you contact me, ian att onchain.io. We just implemented a solution with the BitWasp developers for signing TX's with an android app via QR codes. I'd be happy to integrate the solution into OpenBazaar.

Yes. Definitely.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:37:30
Thanks for clarifying.
What's the nLock timeout on your addresses ? Wouldn't this mean that your addresses would drop down to 1 of 1 after an amount of time ?
For your 2 of 3 are you splitting the keys out to separate devices ? If so do you have a protocol for signing ? I ask this because ideally I'd like to the smartphone to be interoperable.
Any ideas about implementing BIT ID ?

You can get a PDF download of your encrypted private key in BIP38 format. 
So even if our server disappears your wallet is recoverable. 
If your password is weak your key stored by us could be brute forced. However this is only 1 key out of 2. The attacker would still need to get the key on your smartphone.

Bitcoin has the largest amount of power securing the network so would make it a good bet.
However, I suspect they will release their own alternative blockchain (perhaps with a few additions) under a new currency. If they pre-mine it, i.e. award the first block of coins to themselves, they stand to make a lot of money up front.

Private keys are either generated in the browser then AES encrypted.
However if you use the onchain app, the app will generate private keys and the site will only have your extended public keys. The app wallet can be backed up via a passphrase.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:28:35
This would be nice, but library support would be required. i.e. if BitocinJ and BitcoinJS support this then we can implement it.

All lot of the features are similar such as M of N wallets, HD support etc.
The main difference is the coin sweeping API.
For example a website with thousands of users can generate deposit addresses for its users using our HD features.
Then any bitcoins sent to those address are regularly swept into a transaction and sent to the fund. The fund owners can then sign that transaction.
The onchain app, allows you to sign transactions out of band. i.e. you can manage funds via the web interface but keep keys on your smartphone.

A hot wallet is usually the reference bitcoin client installed on a server. The reference clients comes with an API for creating addresses and sending/receiving coins.
Hot wallets are vulnerable because the private keys are kept on the server.
With onchain, there are no private keys on the server, but the functionality for address creation is still there.

Hi, I built bitcoinary.com a few years ago as a localbitcoin style peer to peer trading platform. So I have some experience with reputation.
The main problem was that scammers would create a fake profile with zero reputation. Offer bitcoins at low prices and would nearly always find someone who would fall for it. Seems people can't help themselves when a price is cheap. If you don't have the P.O.B as mandatory, new naive users will get burned. 
Proof of burn, you're kind of saying we don't want proof of charity as that leads to centralisation, but then you have 3rd party escrow, which will also be centralisation will it not. How will users find the 3rd party escrow ? How will they know the 3rd party escrow is not the current buyer/seller they are dealing with.
And my main concern is flooding. How are you going to handle a flood attack, someone creating endless accounts and adverts ? How will a user be able to search through all the crud.

I don't think the issue is whether Ethereum forks or not. The issue is that Etheruem is marketed as a smart contract platform towards financial institutions.
The underlying architecture is flawed making it easier to write an insecure smart contract than a secure one. The DAO highlights these flaws. Ethereums target market will not tollerate these flaws and given rational investors the price should fall until the coin disappears.
I wouldn't recommend anyone to take a position in Ethereum.

This sums it up for me. If you're not using miners to secure the chain, then you may as well just use a public database with signatures.

A considered response for a change. There's a discussion on bitcoin stackexchnage that backs up some of what you've written. 
So in a way there is no incentive for a miner to create larger blocks, given that he takes a chance a smaller competing block could get accepted first due to it's faster propagation.

I wouldn't say it looks bad. Business wise they will make money if Ethereum market cap goes up or down. It's an exchange after all.

I think the point is that Alice and Bob create one transaction on the block chain to start off with, then they can create 1000's of transaction backwards and forwards to each other off chain.
Finally one more transaction is needed when they finish to settle the final balance.
It might be better to not call them Alice and Bob but say for example Bank A and Bank B. Banks exchange funds many times a day but only settle once a day.

Think of it this way.
You buy $1000 BTC at Bitcoinica which would require you to put $100 up as a margin.
If BTC price rises by 10% and you sell you make $100 i.e. you doubled your orginal investment.
If BTC price falls by 20% you would owe Bitcoinica $200. However Bitcoinica would already have sold your position for you at around the $900 BTC price and you would lose your $100.

Hi, I'd be interested to here what you think about Bitcoinary 
We're a person to person exchange and we do have people willing to trade with Liberty Reserve. The benefit to those that are new like yourself is that you're dealing with a real person and they can guide you through the trade.
For example Maria deals with liberty reserve, 
You can contact her and she'll help you.
There are also many other options in the open trade book

1) The transactions will all appear in the block chain connected together. It won't show that they came from the same wallet but people will be able to track all the money flows.
2) Tor makes no difference, Bitcoin doesn't track ip addresses in the blockchain.
3) You can't anonymize a payment by sending it from one address to another.
To anonymise a payment you need someone who will break the chain (block chain).
1. You buy your bitcoins with cash.
2. Buy freshly minted bitcoins from someone who mines bitcoin.
There are many other ways.

"Now if you are talking about amounts that are significant there's only one way to do it -- offline wallet created from a LiveCD on an "air gapped" system"
Most people see getting hacked as the main way you're going to lose Bitcoins, but actually you're more likely to lose them for 1 of 2 reasons.
1. You accidently delete the wallet file and you haven't backed it up.
2. You forget the the password to your encrypted wallet file.
Due to this, you're better off with a hybrid online wallet that doesn't store private keys such as  or  You could also consider creating accounts on both services and loading your private keys into each one. Then if either service disappears you are covered.
You only need to type in your password when making a payment so if you're paranoid that someone could hack your computer, just make payments from your ipad/iphone/android phone or better yet kindle.

We have a remote service that checks our Javascript. It generates a hash for the JS and for the page. This is connected to PingDom so if some cracks our servers (unlikely we're hosted on Heroku), they get about 1 minutes grace before I get an SMS alert.

Thanks kdoto, this was my intention exactly, all the encryption done browser side and they all we do is store your pre-encrypted keys.
It's not perfect, but I think safer than the Bitcoin client and any other e-wallet.

Good luck with this service, it's a great new e-wallet.

The JS code is form the BitcoinJS project and the google encryption project. I'm considering linking directly to those projects for the javascript but that wold leave me open to attack by whoever maintains those projects.
It shouldn't take too long to verify that they are in fact just the minimized version of those libraraires along with some custom code.

The payer should create the transaction AND send it.
The receiver waits for the transaction as normal in the block chain. i.e. Waiting for confirmations via the standard Bitcoin client.

I'm the founder of StrongCoin so I thought I'd explain a little bit more about the demo.
One thing that Bitcoin does very well that we often don't see demonstrated is micro payments. Here's a link giving the case for micro payments from 1998 ! 
This is what I wanted to show with this script, easy to implement micro payments with instant file delivery. i.e. no email address collection, you pay, you download, simple as that.
There are other payment processors for Bitcoin, I want to concentrate on the instant payment area, which means handling Finney attacks. 
The script is very simple to install, it doesn't require a database. 
@_date: 2011-11-08 09:57:07
No one is claiming complete security. But with Bitcoin there's a trade off between usability and security. If you want absolute security you're in control of then you need to 
1. install the client
2. Encrypt your wallet
3. Maintain backups
4. Wait for the block chain to download.
And even then you're not completely secure.
Client side encryption is the way to go for Bitcoin if we're going to give people something that's usable day to day.
@_date: 2011-10-11 09:34:37
It's true I could be threatened to change the Javascript. But I don't think that would benefit an attacker a great deal. They would only be able to collect a few passwords before someone external notices.

The site shouldn't be the only place you store your keys. That's why I have the PDF paper wallet option. This will still have your private key encrypted (It can be decrypted using openssl).
You should send this wallet to an email address or store it on dropbox.

I don't think Bitcoin will ever be main stream in the sense you mean. We will never buy coffee with Bitcoin.
However, I do believe Bitcoin will become a huge store of wealth. Gold 2 if you like. So you are wise to hold your coins.

I mean full node too.
Let's say you run a full node and broadcast a transaction because you send some BTC. If I am listening on your network and see that the transaction has not been broadcast before I know you created it and I know you own that address.

**UPADTE:** SSL has now been added.
Thanks guys, this has stirred up a lot of interest and ~~I'm aware of the concerns in particular getting an SSL certificate which I'll act on right away.~~
There a few of things StrongCoin can do which have not been mentioned.
1. We can import a pre-encrypted key. That means you could create a Bitcoin key pair (perhaps with vanitygen) encrypt it with open SSL all OFFLINE. Then store the public and encrypted private key on StrongCoin. I would recommend this for a savings account.
2. The PDF paper wallet allows you both to backup your keys and transfer your keys out. You always know that at some point you can transfer the keys back in. (The private key in the paper wallet is encrypted). Our encryption is compatible with openssl on the command line. We use gibberish AES javascript library.
3. You don't have to use StrongCoin to spend coins. You can export your private key at any time, which could then be imported into Mtgox or used with an offline client to generate a transaction. 
So I think 1,2,3 give you the most secure way of storing Bitcoins.
The other features of Bitcoin such as account generation and payments give you the convenience of an e-wallet but with better security.
I don't know if StrongCoin will be the best e-wallet service in the market, but I do think that every e-wallet from now on must at least have these features.

On the "for developers" tab, it would be good to see how you would actually integrate this into a site.
What's the API ?
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:54:44
The Bitcoin blockchain gets around the need for central banks and clearing because the currency and network are combined.
The existing banking system uses a messaging protocol called Swift. It's a completely different way to send money, the currency is not tied into the messaging as it is with Bitcoin. Saying that replacing the existing messaging system with a new messaging system will save the banking system billions is completely unfounded.
