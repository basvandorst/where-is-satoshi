Agreed, there are currently a lot of newbie investors in the space because they’re excited by the volatility and prospect of easy money. But that’s only a small fraction of those in the space and a lot more is being done to educate people on the fact that it’s a long term solution rather than a quick win.
It will still take a couple of years before you see more adoption as the infrastructure is still being built to support it. The email took 20 years to get to where it is today.

I think the point here is that everything is constantly evolving and the technology we have today opens up the doors for this thinking in all areas - including money. Bitcoin and other crypto currencies have risen in adoption because of what’s happening in the world today. 
People are waking up to the fact that the government isn’t always there to help them. There’s less trust in “governments” more today than there ever has been. Everywhere you look there’s debt, war, corruption and injustice. And that they need to help themselves.
Bitcoin or crypto is just opening up that conversation. It’s not saying it’s going to be the next best thing forever. The fiat system served its purpose for the time that its been around, but sooner or later we’re going to need to evolve that. 
Nonetheless, if enough people see the benefit of this evolution, the governments will get behind it as they “represent” the people.

not you, he's the dkhead
In 2015: 
Senator Elizabeth Warren accused JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon of engaging in illegal activities. His response ? He leaned back, slowly smiled, and then replied “So hit me with a fine. We can afford it"
