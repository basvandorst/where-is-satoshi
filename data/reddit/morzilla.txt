That's pretty much the same as handling a group Twitter account or any other group-controlled resource: you need a middleman and an admin interface. You'd have a bitcoin client as secured as possible and you would expose an interface to group admins. Each admin would have a different password  (do NOT share passwords). And if you want, you can require each transaction to be approved by, at least, two admins.
I haven't done this with bitcoin, but I have done similar things for groups using IRC/web/telnet interfaces. It's an old problem with old solutions ;-)

Really? How much did you pay to get 1000 MH/s? How much power does it consume? How much do you pay for electricity? Do you really earn enough just to pay for electricity and the AMD GPUs in the short term?

No. Actually, child porn would be hard-coded into your decoding algorithm . The fact that you encode it as a function of some other input of your hard-drive does not change that.

Air VPN admins are well known for their free spech, anti-censorship and net neutrality activism before and after creating the service. So I'm recommending them. They take user privacy very seriously.
