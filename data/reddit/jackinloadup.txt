I pledge to buy Reddit gold with bitcoin!

TLDR: Micropayments can change the way the web works for the better.
[Payswarm]( also shows a pain area for bitcoin. Micropayments. Micropayments are really nessisary IMO to move the web forward. Payswarm's video shows a great example of this for blogs and artists or even content seeders.
How can bitcoin solve this problem without incurring "large" fees of 0.0005 BTC ($0.07)? I only want to send $0.01 to the site/person in the first place.
I understand the fees are in place to make a DDOS attack less viable though. Maybe the fees just need to be adjusted to reflect current market value?
How much are you willing to pay in fees to send someone 1c?
EDIT: is there something about bitcoin I haven't taken into account? untapped features?

Sorry, I must say I assumed you were a developer like myself. The reason I was being facetious about the source for the Ripple server is that I already knew it was not available. Ripple claims to be open source yet it has only open sourced half of the tech. Its client. The server that runs the entire network is still closed source and run by a select few. 
You can check out Ripples public repos here.

So where is the source code for the Ripple server? I would like to turn one on to help the network.

Except that the card can carry multiple identities. So assuming it is easy to switch between them and destroy and create new ones it wouldn't be a huge privacy concern. I wonder what thinks?

Trading the bitcoin portion would be easy. It would be the fiat across network that would difficult if not impossible. Maybe something like dwolla?
