So you just wanted to make a snarky comment. Gotcha!

No they're not in deep shit. They accepting sponsoring from OneCoin when they were much less high profile and them being a scam was much less obvious.

Well this one is. No real technology. Hiding behind some educational product nonsense but marketing their coins exclusively. People involved have a criminal history.  Dozen of broken promises (where are the merchants?). Lies and deception like the Forbes cover that never was, or the Mastercard cooperation that never happened.
Oh, and the magical money multiplication. Invest now, have your investment doubled like 7 times until October.
What does NOT point to it being a scam. Give me an example.

I believe he is a real idiot. Watch some of his videos rambling on and on. He is fully retarted.

You have it 15 minutes of attention and concluded there is nothing pointing to it being a scam. Is this satire?

I'm really not sure about this guy. I rather think that he truly believes in OneCoin. But he's batshit crazy. And engages heavily in motivated reasoning - this is why he seems like malicous. It's really not unusual for people to overlook arguments against their position.
He just recently made a video declaring, that he will not spend any more time arguing against haters. I believe he sincerely is exhausted discussing this topic. He *knows* OneCoin is legit and find's it tedious to keep arguing.

She could still believe it.
Well, I'm torn ...
