I was in credit card debt when I first learned about bitcoin (price $30). Being very conservative with investments I decided I would pay off my massive debts before buying BTC. In December last year, I nearly had my cards payed off, but said stuff it, and withdrew a big cash out at 19% and bought BTC. Should have done it years ago. The upside on BTC is so much bigger than 19%pa. in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:57:32
That will only cause an 80% dip at worst, like gox, it will recover fine.
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:21:34
Both are a fraud, but one is legalised and insured by the taxpayers.

It defaulted on Bretton Woods, it owed more gold to the French than it could pay, it defaulted, but not anything anyone could do about it, as it was by far the worlds super power at the time.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:27:24
Actually because of My BTC investment I could cash out today and have a lot of cash in hand. If I had of invested the money in BTC years ago instead of paying off the card at all I hate to think how cash rich I'd be. Even if BTC does go belly up I still have real estate and other investments so hopefully I'll never be broke, I retired from being an employee at 23. Still work, but not so much for the money.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:38:00
25%pa? You have no idea of the price easily transferable sound money will realise over fiat in the next decade.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:59:16
If the miners are driving up the fees, it doesn't cost them as much as it costs you! Need to go fee-less.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:43:25
Your explanation would work if the quantity of money was fixed. You did not explain the quantity of fiat currency, surely a factor in it's value. Your description works well for bitcoin though.

They are not that bad, they will lead to price stability once bitcoiners get used to them.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:28:55
BTC does not promote investment like fiat does. BTC is neutral, whereas fiat is biased toward investment. Many would say that investments made in BTC would be lower but more prudent, not made simply to avoid inflation. Many would also say the lack of investment would cause a depression, I don't buy that in the long term, because there is no evidence of it.

If a hard currency such as Bitcoin were magically adopted by banks, they would no longer be able to lend money at artificially low interest rates like they can in a Fiat system. They can still lend Bitcoin but would need the corresponding depositors, and banks reputations would be based on their reserves, not just rely on the existence of lenders of last resort. No-one would bail out a Bitcoin Bank.

Hmmm, seems you don't know how banks work. Typically, every time they issue a loan they create money. They can do this because they are licenced in the USA and follow regulations for that licence, just like Australian Banks create Australian Dollars because they are licenced and follow APRA regulations, and UK banks create Pounds because they are licenced there etc...
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:33:51
Just because it is legal, doesnt make it right. Its my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:05:22
that makes no sense, USD tether is deflationary and at higher risk than even a bank deposit!

the fed is just one group of banks, they all make money...
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:03:31
Only American banks can produce USD, so it is harder for foreign banks, they need to trade foreign currency reserves. Tethers banks are apparently in China

In my country the government dont have a monopoly on power... but they don't do anything to take powerof money from the banks, that is because of ignorance of the people.

A country in crisis wont adopt btc, its still way too hard to use. And banks can't fractional reserve, so they will be 100% against it. Typically they go to the USD for a few years till things settle down. BTC is still more like digital gold, in that it is still a bit too hard to trade.

I have sold these before, always happy customers, I explain that they are trusting that I didn't keep a copy, and instruct how to move them for their own benefit, everyone that I have checked have left them where they are. This is a good way to sell dust transactions at a big markup and no transaction fees, for buyers getting $20 worth to put in a time capsule or coin collection, they are not too fussed.

Im with you on supporting btc, i think its lead is insurmountable, unless a government forces a hard currency alternative. I'm white and quite well off, so shouldn't want universal healthcare as it costs me, but I have seen the benefits to society far outstrips my cost, so I'm a supporter of taxation for health, and basics luke food, shelter, legal and education.

I think you are talking about having bitcoin with an intermediary, whom says "you have 0.1 btc" . This is common when people buy btc on an exchange. This is usually ok short term, but the purpose of btc is that you own your own private key funded on the blockchain, so that it highly reccomended rather than owning a promise.

Tether is being used primarily to buy BTC, to the tune of nearly a Billion dollars worth now. If it is discovered that the tether is unfunded, it will in turn, be found that alot of paper btc on exhanges will also be unfunded, in short, alot of people will lose a lot of money, both in BTC and USD, causing a general negative feeling toward crypto, similar to Mt Gox collapse. Mt Gox was a fast wealth shift, this could be another.

Keeping a few BTC is of course a very wise move, but i think putting more of your investment dollars into random companies rather than BTC is a mistake. It's good to spread your investments, but if you believe in crypto you should see that long term the return will be better, and safer. I am currently about 40% real estate, 40% collectibles, 10% crypto, but am currently trying to rebalance more to crypto as I think it is a much safer investment now than it ever has been. I'm sure you'll do OK either way, you have more BTC than you'll ever need!

A private key is just a random number, easily made offline. That private key is hashed, this gives the public key address, this can also be done offline, even with pen and paper(would take months).

There are different regulations in every currency zone, so you may be correct for some places, but not others. All fiat currency zones have the option of a bailout if thats what they decide to do.

Many do benefit immensely from the current system, particulary those that are "credit worthy". There are alot of working poor globally that feed the top of that pyramid, sound money will level that, and will ultimately be much worse for those that are currently credit worthy.

No, because there will eventually be less fractional reserve lending, because the best banks will have high and transparent reserves, rates will need to be higher. Kinda similar to loanshark intrest rates now (loansharks generally are full reserve lenders)

Because the USD is managed to promote investment over saving, thats why they allow banks to create more USD, it lowers the value of USD over time and promotes investment, thats why rich guys typically have shares/bonds, and not USD holdings.
