Why would you want to use a currency that could take a week to have a transaction confirmed? Not to mention the ridiculous fees for doing that transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:11:21
A steady rise? That will *NEVER* be true of a crypto until it gets mass adoption.

Please tell me you weren't using Coinbase to *store* your bitcoins too.
Coinbase is a horrible website. **IF** you buy from them you must store your bitcoins in a separate wallet, like Electrum. Otherwise you're liable to lose everything when Coinbase inevitably shuts down your account (like has happened with thousands of other people).

The lack of fees is what originally drew people to bitcoin in the first place. Why would I even bother using this coin when I can use an alt to do the transaction in a thousandth of the time? The money I save from not paying exorbinate fees over a year will be enough to buy even more of that alt.
But my comment will fall on deaf ears. You're just another Core shill.

I hope you're telling the truth.

I remember seeing that bitcoin wizard on a reddit ad ages ago (maybe a few years) and it honestly turned me off from finding out what Bitcoin was. It looks childish and "magic internet money" is not something that is appealing. I don't want magic, I want something I can trust.
Years later, I found bitcoin through an MMO when someone briefly mentioned it. **AN MMO VIDEO GAME. What the fuck?** I wish the Wizard ads were appealing to me because I would have loved to have known about bitcoin ages ago.
My point is, I'm probably not the first nor the last to be turned off by that weird ad. It's cute, but it needs to be replaced with something informative.
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:32:08
Your comment is so frustrating. I'm not relying on "someone to convince me". I'm torn *because* I'm actively reading both sides of the story and there's a lot of conflicting opinions and "facts". I fully intend to continue reading both forums and other sources of information until I'm certain.
Anyway, I'm not here to be convinced right now. I was just seeing what other people thought on the activation. Question answered.
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:30:18
Because it's childish and uninformative. "Magic internet money" is not something that I think of when I think of bitcoin. Had that ad reflected what bitcoin actually is I would have gotten into bitcoin **years** earlier.
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:21:48
I'm also wondering the same.

You could invest some bitcoins in a gambling website and "bet on the house" with decent annual ROI. There's cons with that, but of course you'll thoroughly research this. I hope.

I don't think he's saying the battery shouldn't ever be increased. He's just saying the improving efficiency makes more sense as the priority. It's not a perfect analogy but it will do.
@_date: 2016-12-13 02:13:59
I bet that guy feels like a total retard.
Unless, of course, he got wise when bitcoin was less than $50 and bought a ton.
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:31:08
Don't worry bro. You just counter-jinxed it by making that post. We good.

1) You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin to buy.
2) No one smart is spending money on bitcoin they wouldn't otherwise be saving. Most who buy bitcoins treat their bitcoin wallets like savings accounts.
So...uh...poverty...? What?

That's a cute chart. It's easy to label these things proactively but it gives us literally no expectation for the future. The plateau of productivity could easily be followed by "the rocket to the moon" or just as likely "the valley of depression".

Anyone who thinks the price will be substantially higher than $700.
Shit, I'll still be buying them when they're $5,000+ because I believe they will still continue to rise way beyond that.
@_date: 2016-11-19 02:15:09
Do you have to do this if you never sell them?
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:16:27
Fairly new to bitcoin. Why isn't it doing way better? People have been telling me for months this would be activated no problem. If this is such a great update, why isn't the majority signalling?
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:20:11
There's SO much wrong with your post. Instead of trying to tackle that whole mess I'll just reply to this:


Bitcoin is *NOT* untraceable. Speaking for just the United States alone here, Bitcoin has a public blockchain and most of the places you buy bitcoin require identity verification by the US government. Every. Single. Coin. Can be traced from the time you bought it to all of the future people they get sent to.

Given the extremely volatile nature of Bitcoin it's wise to only invest with money you're comfortable potentially losing forever. Although there are many speculations that Bitcoin will increase massively in price in the next 5 years there **IS** room for Bitcoin to fail in the long run. I highly recommend researching this topic fully before you touch that IRA money. 
Here's an interesting blog post to consider:
Don't let the pessimism of such articles bring you down completely though. There is still a high chance that Bitcoin could be the best investment you've ever made. It's important to be aware of both the pros and cons of Bitcoin and invest wisely. Having your $50k IRA *and* investing into Bitcoin on the side is probably the smartest thing to do.

Coinbase has the worst reputation that I've seen. If your account is unlocked I highly recommend you transfer all of your money to a more reputable wallet/site.

Hey, I'm new to bitcoin. I don't know much about...well anything. I glanced at the *other* sub and most seem to think that a larger blocksize stops huge backups in unconfirmed transactions (like what is happening right now).
Can you tell me why blocksize isn't important and what the real solution to the problem is?
(I hope I don't seem like a troll. I just genuinely want to learn more)
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:20:42
You must not have used electrum recently.

@_date: 2017-07-27 14:21:32
Exactly. There is no risk for a user to just hodl both coins in the long run. I can see the appeal of selling one to buy the other but why even bother? If you're serious about cryptos and blockchain technology it's in your best interest to keep both and weather the storm. 
6 months to a year from now the market will likely be a very different place. Don't jump the gun. Don't make any assumptions in the next month about the future of these currencies.

You're completely convinced this is a one sided thing. How do you know there aren't just as many sockpuppets on this sub hired spewing just as much misleading information? 
Remove yourself from the politics for a second and look at the two forums objectively. Why is it so hard to believe two or three or more companies couldn't be hiring these services to poison *both* sides of the argument in an attempt to win regular users in their favor?
