Omg mate your questions are so silly, at least make the effort to write some proper answers...
Plus you are talking nonsense for two reasons:
1- USDT means the money stays in the crypto market, so the TMC doesn't drop.
2- The crash we are actually witnessing is partly caused by USDT not being (in investors' mind) the safe haven it used to be, because of the recent USDT fud.
You are the one who should seriously start doing some research and start using your brains to connect the dots.
Otherwise I'm wasting my time writing to you and answering your foolish questions.
That will be my last comment about this here

hahaha omg you are so retarded, I bought long time ago and will not sell because I don't care about what is the current price, I'm not mad at the market, I'm mad at retarded people like you who comment nonsense, don't understand about the correlation between USDT and TMC, and will always use that dumb argument "sounds like you bought at ATH" to make you feel superior.
You are just making yourself look so ridiculous.
You really have no point, no intelligent comments to make, just silly questions and bs like "sounds like you bought at ath and you're mad bro"
Definitely a waste of time.

I live in Hong Kong, speak Chinese, go to Guangzhou several times a month, have many Chinese friends... yes I've done some research.
They all tell me they struggle to buy/sell crypto because the fiat options are extremely limited at the moment. So I'm wondering how it will impact your smartass pattern analysis...

How will Chinese cash out if they have no fiat/crypto exchanges ?
