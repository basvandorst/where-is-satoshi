I might miss a link with the user base, but I wouldn't call the number of people who think tx delays or a few cent higher fees are unacceptable "large". I haven't heard of any newbie who says: I'm totally willing to pay $0.05, but I'm not getting into bitcoin if I have to pay $0.09 for a transaction.
They're softforking towards larger on-chain capacity, they're working on a 100% secure off-chain mechanism to increase capacity, they're working on getting signatures in that are smaller to increase capacity, they're working on relaying blocks faster, verifying signatures faster, making transaction relaying more efficient as those are the main concerns for increasing on-chain capacity. But nono, that doesn't seem to count for anything, all that matters is this one constant which will not stop the debate in the slightest because the second you change the value people will starting asking for another value, that's the thing with changing constants.

That's true, but again you're assuming bitcoin is the best thing for every purpose. If tomorrow a country bans bitcoin and is actively looking for people by getting ISP data, exchange data, etc. bitcoin might not be the best option. If tomorrow a bank wants to have it's backbone on a blockchain, bitcoin might not be the best option. If you want to store a lot of data, if you want to interact with certain communities, ....
Just like LinkedIn is better suited for business, Qzone better for interacting with Chinese people, Tumblr for blogging, etc.
Why would you store money in Dogecoin? The same reason you buy all stuff: you use it so often it makes it worth not going over the hassle and cost of renting/exchanging every time. Dogecoin is a bad example, as it does nothing bitcoin can't do, but as long as you have a specific usecase, you have users.

I think it makes total sense to try core first if you don't know a lot about bitcoin yet. It certainly was my first wallet. You know you can't do wrong with that.
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:17:01
The lightning network isn't a sidechain, it just uses normal bitcoin transactions that are time locked, so you can transact between each other without putting every transaction on the blockchain, but you can settle on the blockchain if you want so you still have the same security.
A hard fork to increase the blocksize is something different. It's not incompatible with lightning, both will need to happen at some point.
The difference is that ideally a hardfork requires nearly everyone to agree on it, while the lightning network is just using bitcoin, no changes are needed at this point (although the upcoming segwit softfork is something most implementations count on)

@_date: 2016-08-29 18:20:33
I think you'll find any full-time bitcoin employed developer at the top. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of companies doing this, so blockstream employers have a good share in that. But there's also Cory Fields and Wladimir from MIT, Suhas Daftuar and Morcos from chain code labs (although I don't know if they work on core full-time), etc. who are pretty high on whichever way you order the list.
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:44:47
I don't know the numbers, but there's probably less than 10 people being payed to work on bitcoin full time.
How much did you pay developers to work on this? If MIT, blockstream, etc. complain I would certainly understand. You are a customer, not GM.

While I tend to agree a flag would be a better solution, what performance do you mean?
@_date: 2016-08-27 16:11:04
- An obvious reason to use it. Like hyper-inflation of the home currency.
- Instant, secure, cheap payments. Like the lightning network hopefully.
- Easy to use, secure hard and software wallets (although that's part of the chicken-egg problem)
- More anonymity. Although not a catalyst for adoption, it is needed.
- time. Technology adoption never happens at once.
Timeline is hard to say, the early adopter group will have to be big enough when shit hits the fan.

I'm not following lightning development that close, and the details go way over my head, but from what I gather:
Nothing is set in stone at this point, but the current standard is 20 hops max I believe.
It's the cheapest fee path. I don't know if they settled on something or if it's still open on which way to do it. I've read things about beacon based routing, there's also this [Ionization Protocol]( which was proposed. Something that requires minimal knowledge of the network in any case.
Each hop can take a fee, yes. Negative fees are also possible, as in some cases you might want to balance between channels, but I assume that'll be a rare case. Personally very interested in how this will work. If it'll be a constant nodes can set, or some sort of variable depending on the state of the channel.
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:50:01
But the reference implementation isn't from a for-profit company. It's an open source project with hundreds of developers.
For one, you can't stop private companies being involved. If blockstream just hired all his developers on a freelance basis, not disclosing who they hired, would that be somehow better?
Secondly: who's going to fund a non-profit organisation, and who'll make the calls of who to hire and where the money goes? As said, we tried the bitcoin foundation and it failed.
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:29:36
If your Core wallet is not synced yet you should wait for synchronization indeed.
Bitcoin works like cash, if you have to pay $30, you give $50 and get $20 back in change. However, if Core is still syncing you have not received the block that has your change, so the wallet doesn't see it. So you'll have to wait until it's synced.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:09:59
It is, but you can also adjust the time and the transactions in the block, so there's really no need for additional variables.
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:43:31
They already stopped doing that I think, the priority system was replaced by just fees per size (and sigops I think). 
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:59:22
No, because abuse isn't clearly defined. See the internet, it's not secure on a protocol level, it's terrible for privacy, it's controlled by governments and companies who can deny you access any time they want. Work-arounds like Tor are constantly under attack. But yet most people are perfectly fine with the way things are, or they're not knowledgeable enough to take action against it.
Moving to offchain tx's isn't viable if the underlying blockchain isn't good. You can fuck up higher level solutions, and bitcoin will still be fine, but you can't fuck up the fundamental basis and expect higher levels to be fine.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:02:06
It saddens me how much effort is needed to explain how important fungibility is. 
From both this and scaling bitcoin I get the feeling there are some miners who have a very skewed view about what function miners have in the system.
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:56:38
It is put in the blockchain to open the channel, and another transaction to close the channel.

Which fact could I possibly give you that supports my opinion? 
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:05:45
Any reputable exchange will do, just make sure you don't keep it there for too long.
There are many ways to store your bitcoins. Personally I keep some stored in paper wallets, some on a hardware wallet, some on my pc and some on my phone. A [hardware wallet]( is probably the most user-friendly way to store them securely.
Strong passwords are obviously preferable, but you might need to remember it years from now. Keep that in mind when you make password protected back-ups.
@_date: 2016-08-21 15:23:14
You can adjust the time every second...
Technically you could use some unused versionbits indeed, but I fail to see why. What is the benefit over changing the merkle root, something you'll be doing anyway as better fee-transactions come in?  
I don't mine and I don't really follow the mining scene, but I haven't heard of any problems with stratum/GBT.
Any versionbit you'll use will at some point be used to flag a fork, so you'll have to change the bits you use as well.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:16:35
I don't know what you're talking about. My point is: your lady gaga reply was not a relevant response, as it is about certain non-financial uses of bitcoin, which neither you nor the one replying to you was talking about.

Litecoin is 5 years old now and still going strong. Communities like certain altcoins for whatever reasons which is something unlikely to die out.
Coins like ethereum that aim to do something significantly different than bitcoin are even more unlikely to die out because people use it for different things.
So I wouldn't call it a threat. Both chains have the same development, so it doesn't really matter which chain people use the most.
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:47:59

It has always been trivially easy to replace transactions. The rbf flag has no effect on that since normal wallets will detect it. Since there's no way to stop always-full-rbf nodes it's just something we have to deal with, like we dealth with it for years.

Most .0 releases include significant performance gains. One should not have to support a softfork to get better performance.

Ethereum doesn't focus on the monetary aspect. It might be a distraction for you, but it might offer useful possibilities for others.
There is no such a thing as a best crypto-currency. There's just crypto best suited for whatever you want to do. It's the same thing as asking why google+, linkedIn, friendster, hi5, Qzone, etc. are still being used while there is facebook. Not even talking about social network sites specific to a use case like pintrest, instagram, tumblr, twitter, deviantart, etc.
When you ask yourself: "what is the best money in general", bitcoin is likely to be the best answer. There are however hundreds of different questions where the answer might not be bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:29:10
Yes, blockstream has hired some of the best bitcoin developers out there, together with some of the best people in other projects and drawn them into bitcoin.
I can't speak for the developers, but it would make sense to prioritize things that benefit the company. Just like with any open source project. All the linux developers of which a majority is payed by large for-profit companies will likely prioritize things that their distro/company needs the most. That doesn't mean changes are made other people disagree with, it just means of all the things that can be done, priority is given to certain things.
If we want bitcoin to grow it would be great to have more people being payed to work on bitcoin. Since the bitcoin foundation has turned into a disaster, it should come from for-profit companies. So really, we need more blockstreams, but not many companies will step up to the plate to hire developers to work on bitcoin.

The lightning network provides instant and secure payments, so that's just around the corner so to speak.

While overestimation of intelligence might be accurate, you fall in the same trap as OP. Just because a few people got scammed doesn't mean the average bitcoiner is not savy enough to not get scammed.
It's a bit like winning the lottery. You never hear about all the "normal" people who lose, you only hear about the winners, giving you the illusion of having a good shot at winning the money.
Since you only see the people who get scammed you get the illusion the average bitcoiner is likely to get scammed.

afaik there hasn't been any developer arguing for no hard-fork ever or no blocksize increase. Discussions have been mainly about hard-forks without hard blocksize increase (like segwit) and whether there should be a blocksize hardfork now, or when the network has improved more. (since it's improved a lot, definitely with compact blocks, I feel like there's more developers who'd agree with a hardfork)
I like that there's some work being done on what should happen on a hardfork and how it can be done as safe as possible, instead of the old "let's change 1 constant" discussion.

Big software companies that have millions to spend on developers often have to delay their release date. Sometimes they even have to cancel their product.

So all it takes is one miner to tweet about it, and the blocksize debate is over. Why didn't we think of this earlier?
Seriously though, until there's a long term solution everyone agrees on, the debate will always go on.
The agreement involves 5 developers. If people want to hold them accountable for it, that's fine by me, but people tend to think of this as a stance/agreement from the bitcoin core project as a whole.
There's no winners or losers in this, it's not a competition, we all want the same outcome.

Simple, not 100% accurate, but good enough version to understand it: Alice has a channel open with Bob containing 1฿. She pays Bob 0.1฿ via the channel, which means she sends a transaction which sends 0.9฿ to her and 0.1฿ to him but they don't publish that transaction on the blockchain.
Next time Alice sends Bob another 0.1฿, so she'll send a transaction that sends 0.8฿ to her and 0.2฿ to him, which they don't publish either. This would be a problem because Alice already has a transaction that sends 0.9฿ to her, so why would she use the 0.8฿ to close the channel. The solution to this is to time-lock the transaction, so if Bob sees the 0.9฿ transaction published on the blockchain he has time to publish the 0.8฿/0.2฿ transaction himself.
But of course Bob needs to see the transaction. That's why you can't stay offline for more than a day.
This time-locked transaction also means that if the channel is closed without consent of the other participant you need to wait that one day to get your money back (refund).
If you don't want to pay Bob, but want to pay Zelda, the lightning network seeks a path via Bob to Carol to Dave to Eve ..... to Zelda, each hop contains this 1 day-ish lock-time delay, so to get a refund you have to wait until all time-locks time out (if the channel isn't closed with mutual consent), which can be over a month if you have a lot of hops.

I would say it's normal volatility.
It's hard to suggest a video if you can't pinpoint the gaps which needs filling. The video that I learned the most from was from a 2013 video from Andreas Antonopoulos, which has pretty bad sound quality as it's filmed while having diner. It's old, so some things might be outdated but I think it still explains what bitcoin is all about greatly.
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:42:45
Yes, but in a practical sense where you actually anonymize your transactions I don't see how you can go cheaper.
Schnorr signatures are pretty high up on some peoples list from what I gather. Elements alpha is running with schnorr signatures iirc, so it's been tested. Thanks to segwit it's possible to introduce it as a softfork as well.

Outside of the fact bitcoin is irreversible money, which makes it ideal for scamming, there's also Nigerian princes, car buyers, bank phishing sites, people "borrowing" money, etc. in the "normal" world. Not even talking about the legalized scams.
It's a community about money. Of course there will be more scams around it. Just like the poker-community will have more scams than say I also don't really think it's such a widely held stereotype. There's some really smart people in bitcoin, but I rarely see anyone making a comment about the average being smart.

Roger, just like Gavin wants to scale bitcoin like the internet was scaled: as fast as possible, as big as possible. If it becomes too centralized or insecure, we'll just have to try and disrupt it all over again.  
This makes a lot of sense financially, as it's the fastest way to increase the value of bitcoin on the short term, although I honestly don't think that's the incentive for Roger. He just thinks it's really unlikely to go bad, and is passionate enough to try and make it happen, whatever the means.
Most of us, I think, want bitcoin to scale like Tor. As fast a possible without sacrificing security, integrity or decentralization. Able to survive any attack as good as possible.
These are two fundamentally different points of view, both having their merits I guess. It's just a shame Roger tries to push his view the way he does.

I don't know a lot about proof of stake, so I might be missing things.
- Most blockchains run on some kind of PoW, yes.
- There are many different ways: 
- It's the same as with PoW, if you run a node you are checking all transactions if they're valid, so there's nothing malicious that can be done directly. If you have a light client you might want to wait for more confirmations as it's "free" to create a new block.
The largest problem with PoS is the "nothing at stake problem". With PoW you burn energy, so if 2 blocks are made simultaneous people mine on the one they see first and later on the one that has an extra block because that's how they profit the most from the burned energy. With PoS you have no cost, so it's "free" to mine on multiple chains, even if 1 chain doesn't have as much blocks, as long as there's a chance you can catch up with the main chain it makes sense to mine both.

The system is designed in a way users are represented, by the economic value they give to the system, and by use. However, the code is what the coders get into the project. That's just the way it is. Voting code into the codebase is something ethereum and the DAO is trying to do, but that's not possible for bitcoin atm. 
Much progress has been made for scaling. Segwit, Xthin, compact blocks, schnorr is in the rails, all the changes that allow LN, etc. In fact, I'd argue most of the big changes in the last year are towards scaling.
As a user you have the freedom to do with your economic value what you want. If you feel what happened and the projected timeline is not enough, you are free to go, without much friction. You can even fork off and direct your economic value towards the new chain, like ethereum did.

Those words weren't in this thread/post. Again, it doesn't matter what someone once said somewhere, it has no value whatsoever.
I also like people to plainly state things, why don't you practice that yourself? Because plainly stating something doesn't involve aggressively dismissing stuff and calling people out on stuff they once said somewhere.
Not every single question is an attack, and even if so: be the better man. There's rumors of a lightning implementation which might have a lot of success, wondering whether the network can handle that doesn't seem like a weird response. Even if you think it's a contrived question, it's something that deserves an answer. Your first answer was already defensive and things just got worse from there on.
If you want people to be on the developers side you have to inform them. Not only for OP, but for the people reading this. People that come here once and a while see this question and will want to know an answer. They don't care about what you think the intentions of OP are, all they see is a vague answer and someone picking on OP.

Almost every exchange has been hacked at some point.
There's also legal issues you have to face. 
If you want to dabble with some bitcoin stuff, there's many interesting projects out there: wallets, coinjoins, openbazaar, etc. or if you're more serious there's many companies hiring.   ,

No, the password is to encrypt your key, not to generate it. However, when you encrypt your wallet a new key is generated because otherwise an unencrypted version of your wallet would be on your drive temporarily, which is a security risk. So you should always back-up your key AFTER you encrypt it or change the password.

Sorry, leave the Gaga thing alone.
What I think is toxic:
"What you're talking about is nonsensical so there's no way to continue from there. "   
If you think it doesn't make sense, ask what he means, don't say this.
"t's easy to read into your statements as concern trolling, because of your other false statements about Bitcoin Core and attacks on the team and its developers, like calling them extremists, not credible, pathological, traitors, evil, will kill bitcoin, irresponsible. That points to a mind already made up and not truly seeking new information."  
 
It's not relevant what he said in some other place, it's not relevant what you think he thinks. What's relevant is the question at hand, which is fairly normal question imo.
"What's bad style is trying to come up with contrived scenarios to paint Bitcoin Core as not doing things to address those imaginary situations and then trying to patronize people who point out simple things like businesses should contribute to the development if they want to see changes and improvements made to benefit them."  
No one is patronizing, he nicely made clear he thinks you misunderstood what he was trying to say.
"What's bad style is trying to come up with contrived scenarios to paint Bitcoin Core as not doing things to address those imaginary situations and then trying to patronize people who point out simple things like businesses should contribute to the development if they want to see changes and improvements made to benefit them."  
This is after the many times he tried to keep it on topic mind you. Again: it doesn't matter what the reasons are and what you think his hidden agenda is, just answer the question.
Every post following that is just attacking him.
All of this could've been avoided if you just answered the question in OP, or made clear what videos on the blockchain have to do with anything.

The core philosophies is in the consensus part. No one can force anything upon the rest.
Fracturing is pretty natural I think once things get bigger, but at the end of the day developers who want to add more data-possibilities will need approval of developers who want more privacy and they need approval of the developers who want assets linked to the blockchain, and they need approval of developers that want fast and cheap transactions, etc... Things tend to balance out.

So why not? Why coinbase and not the 20 others?

Olivier Janssens is not a developer, he's part of the group that likes classic.

The users verifying blocks will not accept those blocks and not relay them. Right now you can fork bitcoin and create a longer chain by selecting a different difficulty even with a simple cpu. People will just not accept your blocks. 
If you mean the 50% is refusing blocks by the minority by for example censoring certain transactions users will have to be more active and fork away themselves by for example changing the proof of work.
This would make millions of mining equipment obsolete so they are incentivised not to do such a thing.

That's assuming Satoshi is still active in bitcoin development.
There are some women doing great things for Tor, I don't see a reason why woman couldn't do great things for bitcoin.
In fact, there was some crypto stuff Pieter Wuille wrote which a lot of developers didn't feel comfortable reviewing so they asked Isis Lovecruft to do an independent review. I think one of her students or something did the review though, can't remember all the details, it was a couple of months ago.

Outside of the fact I can't find any coinbase blog from Gavin or any reference of him being on their payroll, it really doesn't matter.
Coinbase likes bigger blocks, that's a statement you can clearly make. But because 1 guy that codes on software that could enable those bigger blocks has a concern about LN means coinbase is fighting tooth and nail is a stretch don't you think? What's even more of a stretch is involving the opinion of someone who also likes that software (as Olivier Janssens is not a developer).
It's about the same as stating people who like bitcoin-core therefor also believe in Jesus, as Luke-Jr is a hardcore christian.

They would enforce some limit indeed. However, that limit would be much higher than most people would consider safe in terms of keeping things decentralized. Large mining pools benefit more from larger blocks. Things like thin blocks and compact blocks solve this in normal conditions, but not in adversarial conditions. The requirements for participating in the network as a full node will be much higher and will force people to use light clients which are not as safe (from a security and privacy perspective). The cost of storing this data on thousands of computers for all eternity is too big. Solutions that make the cost of participating and the general cost of the network lower won't be able to compete.

I feel like every single issue here could be addressed with Andreas Antonopoulos quotes :)
You start off with the most important thing. "Bitcoin as it is, is disappointing" and really, it is. It's hard to use, hard to secure, hard to do anonymously, hard to understand, etc.  
That reminds me of Andreas talking about his first e-mail experience. Where he had to have UNIX command line skills, compile his own e-mail client, etc. After a few hours he was ready to send his first e-mail and only after 3 days his e-mail arrived. What an amazing technology.  
His first web experience was similar, a lot of technical know-how to accomplish visiting one of the three websites that existed in the world.  
It wasn't amazing because of the technology at hand, it was amazing because he could see how this technology might evolve.
My mom doesn't really understand the internet. If she has to go to  she types it into google, because she doesn't really get what URLs are for or what they are. Back in the early days of the internet it would be unimaginable to think such a person could get on the internet and even more unimaginable she would do anything useful on it. Well, today my mom sends e-mails, looks things up, is on facebook connecting with the family and friends, watches videos, does online banking, buys stuff online, etc.
Bitcoin is the same. The reason I'm into bitcoin is because almost every single day I read about someone building new things on/with bitcoin which will open up a whole new set of opportunities. If the bitcoin today would be the bitcoin of tomorrow, I would leave instantly.
Someday, and that day is not today, bitcoin will be a viable alternative for entire nations who see their wealth disappear because of government failures.  
Someday, bitcoin will be instant, secure and easy to use and host applications that neither of us could imagine in our wildest dreams.

Yes, the abandontransaction command is precisely meant for getting your wallet to show your funds, so you can spend it again.
Syncing might fix it automatically, I don't know, but you don't need to to use abandontx afaik.
I've never used abandontransaction myself, but it should work like this: right-click on your pending transaction - copy transaction ID - help &gt; debug &gt; console - abandontransaction "&lt;paste your transaction ID&gt;"

It's hard to call it sustainable since it's only here for a relative short period of time, but inflation and its effects on the economy has brought us a lot of wealth. We likely wouldn't be communicating with each other if this didn't happen.
I don't think it's sustainable and we're seeing the cracks become so big it's starting to break, but history-wise inflation has been very good to us. The reason it's cracking (among other things) is that we're so wealthy (in the western world) we can't produce new things fast enough to keep up with the inflation.

You keep finding new questions, which become further removed from the actual issue. 'The free market will solve everything' is a bit too general of an idea to add something to this discussion imo.
Non-the-less I'll try and answer:
Free markets don't have alternative motives. Bitcoin does. Bitcoin is aiming to be secure, decentralized, anonymous, digital cash. In a free market it goes where ever the market goes, it doesn't care about values. Just like in the Tor-project the market wants to go as fast as possible, but that would mean certain trade-offs have to be made undermining the core values of the project.
'Free market' as an answer to a limit is so vague for this subject. It would beg the question why we'd have any limits in bitcoin. Why the sigop limit, why the timestamp-limit, why the OP_return limit, etc.

People have been posting patterns like this for 2 years now. Technical analysis can get you an idea of where the underlying market is going, but "this looks kind of the same as this thing that happened before" is about the same as spotting faces on Mars.
The fact your smallest square can fit like 200 times in your largest square should ring a bell as well. If you watch the 1-minute chart you'll be able to find thousands of similar patterns... or any other pattern you wish for.

That option has been talked about (starting from outside of core), and if someone wants to work on that, that's fine. Overall I don't think it matters that much, there's positive and negative sides on both approaches. It's just developers' choice, the one that wants to work on a new wallet chooses the approach, the rest is just happy that someone wants to do the work, since it's long due.

@_date: 2016-08-30 15:35:17
Because there are limits...   
Bear in mind there's already been a block that took 25 seconds to verify, on electrum servers it took almost 4 minutes.
Attacks aren't always obvious and aren't always intentional. The problem is that you don't see it until it's too late. If normal users aren't able to fire up a node it's already too late. If alternative implementations have a too hard time to keep up, it's already too late. The problem is that bitcoin will work perfectly fine if only a few nodes serve the entire system and if only a few miners run the network. We'll be watched and censored, but like I said in my comparison between the internet: no one cares. A free market goes where the money is, and that's not with the few anarchists, libertarians and free spirits that we have now in bitcoin. 
A bit off topic, but your first sentence really annoys me. It's totally irrelevant, it has derogatory language (surely you most know words more civilized than "FUD spewers"), it brings up things that have nothing to do with anything (headersfirst), and last of all it's incorrect as Satoshi implemented the sigop limit.

Technically it's not required (it never is), but the old priority system which prioritized those transactions isn't in the latest versions anymore, so a lot of nodes wont relay your transaction, and not a lot of miners will include it in a block.

I have no reason to believe classic is actively fighting LN, but that's not the discussion here. Coinbase is not classic. Their name is on their site among many others, and that's it. Do you believe all the 20-ish companies that support classic are fighting tooth and nail against LN? 
I've shown you the video of the inventors of LN talking at coinbase itself, an important coinbase employee stating they might be interested in helping with development. You've shown me a quote that voices concerns about LN from a developer for a project that coinbase likes (and to be honest, we all know the only reason those companies support classic is because they want a 2mb bump, not for the great insights of its developers).

Let's hope the network will be larger than 5 people though. It's only logical there will be some larger than others, yet that doesn't mean they are a "central hub".   
Notice how your example is flawed, as you state Alice and Bob only have enough money for a channel between them, yet Eric somehow has a channel with them. Also note that since Bob is connected to Eric, Alice doesn't need to have the channel with Eric, so she can connect to other people instead.

What you read into this because of former behavior doesn't concern his participation in this discussion; in fact he literally asked of you to not read more into his lines as is written.   
Achow had a good answer, OP asked more about it, Achow delivered, OP thanked and tipped him. That is not someone I'd say has "a mind already made up and not truly seeking new information".
Think about your lady gaga response. Someone is basically asking: this is something we want and encourage, shouldn't we take extra precautions for it? To which your response basically is: why would we do this for something good if we aren't going to it for something bad. Which is an answer that makes people think you didn't get the premise. Instead of clarifying, you just got into this mess.
Imagine you just answered (correct me if I'm wrong): Yes we should do out best, but we're already doing that. There shouldn't be sacrifices being made because someone wants to launch something the network can't handle, no matter how good and well designed it is.
How different would the conversation have gone? That's a conversation I would actually want to be involved in, as, while writing it, I realized this would set a precedent of "just launch your app and we'll adjust".

If there's anyone for some reason holding back intentionally to sabotage bitcoin, it's likely they'll revisit the percentages, but it's unlikely that such a thing will happen imo, the progress of bitcoin is their own bottom line.

I agree, but this is a case where someone who already made a decision is talking random shit.
I love a good discussion, but at some point it becomes stupid enough to not bother. For example you can argue with people who have some conspiracy theory, but when they're saying things like "the earth is actually flat" you just don't bother. You know they have access to the information they need, you know other people have tried to explain things. There's no value whatsoever in giving him space to spread his nonsense. It reminds me of a joke from Dara O'Briain where he makes fun of this notion that every opinion is equally valid (  )

The first line contains two lies. "LN scales worse than BTC" I don't even know what the rational behind this could be. "moving traffic to higher layers isn't a scaling solution"  Name one technology that has scaled without creating layers.
Pruned nodes are a scaling solution, I agree, but we already have those.
Light wallets and especially header first mining is as much of a scaling solution than: "just use paypal" imo. It's incredibly easy to scale a blockchain if you don't care for security, privacy, autonomy, etc. Point of scaling is to scale everything, including security, privacy, etc.

That was my bad, writing on mobile doesn't create the best texts.
What 0.12 will be: when the node sees a transaction that spends the same inputs as a transaction already in the memorypool, it'll check if the old transaction has opted-in for RBF. If it hasn't everything works just like before and the new transaction gets ignored. If the old transaction has opted in, the node will replace it with the new transaction and relay that transaction across the network.  
What  proposed (I see it is closed now, so too many people didn't agree to it) was to make it optional. Meaning the node can choose to (0) never replace transactions, even if they opted-in. (1) always replace transactions, even if they didn't opt-in. (2) opt-in, the default behavior which checks the nSequence field.

I don't think it's possible to have a formally written policy that addresses all unwanted posts, while allowing all wanted posts (which is extremely subjective to begin with).
There would be public attention on this post if it was rejected as well, so there's nothing you could've done to make it right by everyone imo.   
FWIW I would've rejected it, the post you referenced in the IRC logs I would've probably done the same: annoyingly accept it.

Are the graphs and numbers you give still correct in case of a decline in full nodes in relation to SPV wallets?


I have also seen many oppose implementing seg wit via hardfork. I haven't seen a lot of people have a "no hardfork ever" attitude either, and that doesn't even matter because your plan already has a hardfork in it. Can't imagine someone who doesn't want a hardfork will suddenly be alright with 2.  


How then? Like we've seen with filesharing governments find new ways of attacking networks and file-sharers.  Currently bitcoin is not at all resistant to governments, because they haven't attacked it yet.   Not giving in to governments might mean fully anonymous transactions which might higher the validation time, or hiding network traffic via tor which will mean slower networks, etc.  
 &gt; I was also talking about full nodes (and pruned nodes since the data usage is the same). Monthly data for full nodes would not exceed 300GB until the year 2027.
In that case you should redo your numbers, because by that time the blockchain will grow just short of 300GB per month, meaning a non-full node will have that traffic.

$15 Thanks for doing this, I think this is the kind of approach we need to be taking.
I will look at it more in depth soon(ish), but some things that come to mind when skimming through:  I don't think 30-days for a full node is an acceptable limit.  (and pruned node storage limits are way too low)  
You don't seem to take into account validation time. A block needs to be validated before it can be relayed. (1 second block propagation should have rang the bell there)   
What will be the effect on the network if we have increased  pruned nodes and SPV-wallets and decreased the number of full nodes?   
Your timing seems really off. Not only is a 6 month hardfork schedule VERY tight, you assume things will be in that nobody might even be working on at this point.  (why not a softfork first, anyway? don't see a reason to do 2 hardfork so close to each other)  
Where does the serialised broadcast savings come from?   
I think worst case scenarios involve governments being hostile to bitcoin and we might be needing extra resources to get past certain restrictions.

Excess capacity is an increasing problem indeed, so you might be on to something there, although keeping it cool might be a big problem since those times of excess power usually happen when it's hot and sunny (when we're talking about power plants).  
Individual windmills and solar panels having smaller miners shouldn't have that problem.
Large businesses or individuals mining to "help" is hardly happening right now, so there's no reason to assume it'll happen in the future.  
Offsetting the cost of heating IS making a profit. However, it's very hard to compete with traditional (and future) heating sources.

Any reason to think this will be the case?  
Just because mining hardware will take longer to become obsolete doesn't mean more people will start mining imo.   
Bitcoin converts electricity to security, it's extremely hard to overcome the cheap electricity.  
There's this "let's put ASIC's in a toaster" gimmick floating around, but I haven't seen anyone looking at the details and thinking it's a good idea. Plus, miners haven't matured enough either to use their excess heat for other things.

more and cheaper transactions and government compliance creates a bigger audience.   
There's a huge market for undercutting paypal, the market for decentralized, anonymous, stateless money is smaller.   
A lot of developers got in when bitcoin wasn't worth anything, or like 10 000 coins for a pizza. It would be extremely risky to invest not only money but also your carrier on it. With hindsight 20/20 it makes sense to do that, but not at that time.

Yes indeed, so it must be wrong. You can't have 300GB in traffic on a full node if the size of all blocks that month alone is already that size.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:18:49
Thanks for the constructive reply.
There's some minor things I wanted to say, but this seems more important:


There's not a lot of logic in the idea of: the miners might not do it anyway, therefor it's not a problem.
We'd increase the blocksize for miners to actually make bigger blocks, let's assume they do (possibility they might not speaks in favor of not increasing the blocksize, because then we'll at least know where we're at).  
The problem is not so much the idea of orphaned blocks, but that it all stacks in favor of large pools/companies. Orphaned blocks favor large pools, the propagation time itself (extra time to mine on top of your own block) favors large pools, smaller pools being more incentivised to make smaller blocks works in favor of large pools (both in terms of fees, as in terms of shorter "alone-time" with your own block")
Bitcoin favors large pools right now, this has also been discussed for years. Now the discussion is: how much worse are we willing to let this get?

There are people more qualified to answer you, but I'll have a go.


There's also people not asking for it, which is the whole point he was trying to make.


Not only can something be irresponsible when everyone agrees (current monetary system), but not everyone is agreeing.


So he shouldn't have comments on the way decisions are made, because he doesn't agree with a certain decision?


I agree, I think that piece of text isn't adding anything and it's trying to get people into a certain mindset.


But why should it be fixed a certain way when there are many possible options and enough time discuss it.
Wouldn't it be in the best interest of everyone that we wait until we have found the best solution(s)?


It is his opinion, that's why he writes it. That's how discussions work.  
I feel though as the amount of devs that don't support the exact change being proposed is large enough to make a fuss. I'm not talking about reddit users who go "yay, more transactions!". We can discuss whether "just" users should make an impact or not if you want to go that route.


Although I agree "easy" is a misplaced word, I do think he has merit in saying ignoring minorities is a dangerous path. We all know the "first they came for..." poem.


No it's not. It's not in favor of whatever other solution, it's in favor of "let's ALL agree on something".


100% is utopia I'd agree. He's just pointing out though that the 75% is pretty arbitrary and it could be a lot worse if we'd continue with the SAME idea of "no single mining pool should be able to stop this".


I agree.


This problem though requires more than knowledge about technicalities of bitcoin. Do you truly and honestly know you have a very good grasp on how much bigger propagation times affect the strategy of large and small mining companies/pools?


This is contrary to yourself who has not provided a single relevant technical argument and has only provide extremely week logical arguments.
Kudos to Gavin indeed. He's under a lot of pressure and does as good of a job as anyone can in his position imo.  
The reason though for not making technical arguments is because he's complaining about the way decisions are made.


Tell us why it's obviously false. (I guess you put some symbols wrong cause I don't get your "OR" thing)
Everything is speculation, since we don't know what will happen until it does.
You're seeing a lot of ghosts and conspiracy. Even Peter Todd, who's being nailed to the cross by some, has said he'll support 20Mb blocks if propagation time is fixed. Something that needs fixing anyway.
Is that really someone who's spreading FUD in order to promote whatever project they are working on?
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:27:29
Your logic is flawed in the sense that you're comparing purchasing power at the end, while you should compare it with the purchasing power you would've had if you kept the money. (and throughout the years)
It's also flawed because you don't make the same returns in both currencies, since your returns are also subject to de/in-flation.
There's nothing renewable energy adds to the idea of investing. Investing in a deflationary system brings lower returns.

I realize your results don't show 30 days, but I think if you're going to give certain limits of what is acceptable (which is a good approach imo) it should be done right. Now it seems like you just took the results and based the acceptable numbers on that. 
I think it's a natural process for the percentage of nodes to decrease. Less tech-savy users, more mobile users, etc.  
Transactions take around a second to reach the 50th percentile, I don't know the details of thin blocks etc, but it seems weird blocks suddenly start with 0.4s in 2017.
I don't think quickly doing a hardfork (and we really don't know how long it'll take before everyone is updated) is a good idea for sake of "rehearsal". I agree that it's a good thing to have done it before, but to rush it just because we want the example doesn't seem like a good idea.   
I understand the idea of serialized broadcast, I was just wondering where the 0.5 and 0.75 broadcast time came from.
What if every government actively bans bitcoin, can it still survive? For example: if everything runs on tor, can we still have &lt;20 second propagation times? How long will it take to start a new node, etc.   
Another issue that just came into my mind is the bandwidth usage limits. A lot of people, me included, have no choice but to take providers that set a certain GB/month limit (or "fair use"). It would be interesting to set standards for that as well imo.  
Things that would also be interesting are the long term ideas, and which bottleneck they affect (although you probably can't quantify it). Like the batched verifying I've heard of, schnorr signatures, SNARK, etc.

People can mine right now if they cared. People just won't start mining if it's losing them money.
It's not a statement about hydropower, it's about cheap electricity. Which in the case of Chinese miners comes from a government agreement. If you have solar panels your cost of converting that energy into bitcoin is the price you get payed for delivering that same energy to the net. Which is cheaper as the price you pay for taking from the net, but I doubt it goes below the Chinese miners. 
Yeah, that was bad wording on my part. I meant "miners" as in the people that mine (right now). They don't use their excess heat right now (afaik), but they can use that heat to do other things. (growing crops, heating other buildings, etc.)
The end of moore's law doesn't mean no progress is being made, it just means slower degrading of hardware.
Basically it's this:
Energy + hardware + time = bitcoins + utility
As a home user the energy is more costly, the hardware is more expensive and you don't heat things all the time, so you have less time mining on the most optimal hardware (which might be a while, but progress doesn't stop). Professional miners can increase their utility output as well (as said above).  
On the plus-side, home users utility is a sunk cost, so you can discount the energy it would've otherwise cost.  
Personally I don't think it'll ever balance in favor of home-users.  
Also note that you're not only competing against professional miners, but also against cheaper heating solutions (sun boilers, geothermal heating, etc. there's also progress in this market, which takes away from the sunk cost)
EDIT: if anything I see excess energy as the most promising thing. (as u/DakotaChiliBeans pointed out)

This made me realize something important. You're American, your electricity prices might be totally different as ours in Europe, it might be cheap enough over there to overcome a small disadvantage over the chinese professional miners.
To paint the picture where I come from: I don't know anyone who uses an electric water heater, it's by far the most expensive way of heating things. Electric heaters are non-existent outside of portable ones.  
From within my house I can see 3 other houses with solar panels on them.   In fact, if you build a new house you are obligated to have some form of renewable energy installation in it, sun boilers being one of the options.

You might have. The opt-in part works, so standard transactions are still opt-out. You can't ignore the opt-in or opt-out transactions though, so your node is going to replace opt-in transactions and not replace opt-out transactions. The optional pull request (which doesn't have consensus yet) is about ignoring users choice and let your node do what you want.

Again: your returns are also subject to in or deflation.
So in 30 years you'll net:  
Deflationary system: 5 681 446 units  
Inflation: 10 142 020 units 
Which is in favor of deflation's purchasing power, IF you save up all the cash. If you put your money in a bank-account with interest, or spend the money, things get different.
However, for your initial point of 4 years: You'll get a return of 970398, which is a purchasing power of 1029794 which is less than the purchasing power of the initial 1M, which amounts to 1061208
Compared to inflation which is respectively 1030402, 969806 and 941192.
I might not be up to date with the latest technologies, but from what I recall the earn-back rate of solar panels are 10 years+, so that makes a way worse case for a deflationary system.
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:56:07
They could limit it if they want, but that's up for debate.
Counterparty and various other implementations use the OP_RETURN code, so there's a lot of investment being build on this feature already.
At some point in time we'll have to let go of the idea of keeping the entire blockchain anyway, so I don't feel like that's the issue.
I'm also on the "pollution" team I guess, but I realize people want to do stuff now and not wait on side-chains, maidsafe, ethereum, etc.
My prediction would be that once those things are out, projects will move to those solutions and the bitcoin main-chain will consist of largely transactions alone. (prediction pulled out of thin air)

That doesn't really matter, are your figures still correct if we have 6000 nodes for 50% of global transactions?


If not, than why hardfork over softfork?


I would consider bitcoin a failure if we're at the grace of governments.   
There's 2 different views on this: scale it like the internet, so scale fast, make trade-offs and try to disrupt it in 30 years.  Or "lets not make the same mistakes as we did with the internet".   


I was talking about full nodes.  
If your idea envisions full nodes only run by miners and big companies I think that's something you should include.

First of all I want to point out that you can't argue about "forcing" people, and conclude their advice won't change a thing when you yourself are trying to force your opinion and steer this whole tipping thing in a certain direction.
The word 'insult' is something subjective, which means that you nor anyone else can tell me what I should or shouldn't find insulting.
What if your boss told you you'll only get 1$/hour from now on. Or what if he said it's for 1 day, or 1 hour? Wouldn't you feel insulted he doesn't value your time more than that?
Tipping me 1 bit, and wasting a second of my life amounts to about 1.3$/h. Is it that surprising I'm insulted that you don't value my time more than that?

Rough translation:
Bitcoin embassy Amsterdam opens December 12
After Montreal, Warsaw, Tel Aviv, Paris, and Kiev soon Amsterdam will welcome it's own Bitcoin Ambassy. The special Embassy will be situated next to "Hofje van Wijs" at "Zeedijk 43", and will be opened on December 12th.
The bitcoin embassy Amsterdam is a non-profit initiative that strives to be a low-entry platform for all bitcoiners.
For example, the embassy can be used as a flex-workspace, meetingcenter or meeting-spot. The bitcoin embassy will also offer showcases for new cryptocurrency-products both home-produced and imported, that in some cases will be sold in a little shop on site.
Besides that, you can eat and drink in "'t hofje van Wijs", whereby you can pay in bitcoin, while there's already a BTM present.
The bitcoin ambassy Amsterdam is sponsored by Rubion, Bitpay, Blocktrail and mrbitcoin.
People who want to be present at the opening or simple want more information, you can find it at

There are more cheaper conferences that have a community drive behind it, take your opportunity there.
Not to mention it'll be harder to find certain people to talk to because there's more people, the fact seats are limited and people who have stuff to add might actually not get a seat.

I get the general idea, and I agree with it. But in the sense of the economy as a whole.
People won't consume as much and therefor the economy gets smaller and you're in a downward spiral.
I do think this is a larger problem as most bitcoin people make it out to be.
What I don't agree with is this idea that shop owners can't deal with it. It really doesn't matter if they buy it for 10 and sell it for 9 as long as 9 buys you more stuff now as 10 did in the past. You resell the car for more value, not for more currency.

The time it takes for a block to be found (the 10 minutes).
All transactions go into a block, that block is put in the blockchain. Each time a new block is found it stacks up on the previous blocks, making the previous blocks more secure.
In general we say a transaction is confirmed when it's included in a block. Technically a transaction is being verified nearly instantly.

It depends on how you define 'investment', but I feel it'll depend on where it stands in society.
If it'll get to 10k in 2 months, there will be a lot of people selling. If it reaches 10k when bitcoin is accepted is more places than you can count, a lot of people won't feel the need to sell, and wont really look at it as an investment, but just as money.

As someone who works for a postal company I can confirm this is common practice.
Pretty much any option where you pay less for longer delivery time could be transferred just as quickly as the more expensive option, but at some point in time it gets artificially delayed.
It actually could take a while to look for the actual package. Someone has to go for that package, and that someone has to get payed. Either you or the sender opted for the slow and cheap delivery, don't call people lazy because you're too cheap to pay them for the service you want.

My father ran a fully cash grocery store for years, so it's very doable, surely for small businesses without any large items.
My assumption was because in my country (Belgium) these sign are pretty common and not really frowned upon afaik. So maybe it's a credit card thing (99% of transactions are debit card here), it's a country thing or shops don't get reported as much over here.
How would bitcoin not eliminate these issues?

You can set a reoccurring payment to an exchange if you want. This serves no purpose other than giving power to the ones that misuse it.

The random number generator must be centralized imo. So does the payment system. You can process it on a p2p network, but you can't let the client side decide if it should send losses. You can easily hack around that.

* You can do business with people from that area or not, nothing really changes, just like the NY regulations don't really change a lot for people outside of NY.
* Not really, and even if so, how does it matter?
* Bitcoin wallets aren't bank accounts, so you can't treat is as such. IF this ever happens, it's very likely to happen in a region with a lot of unbanked people, so not sure how you're viewing this.
Countries without an own currency seem like the largest contender. Countries like Zimbabwe, maybe even Argentina since their currency is likely to go down for the 3rd time or something.

1) I think you might want to take a look at bitmessage: 
2) You can build it on the wallet side using traditional methods, but encrypted with your key. I think addresses are too long to put in the blockchain itself, and it's not really desirable to bloat the blockchain like that anyway imo.
The logical way is: you scan the QR, which takes you to a webpage or app, fill in your address, click OK, which takes you to your default wallet-app and you pay.

Yeah, over the long term it's surely a choice worth thinking about, but for day to day activity it's not that important.
Right now, since money is such a bad store of value, people buy all kinds of assets to store their value, creating all these bubbles and therefore denying access to people who need it but can't afford it (like houses). So in itself I think it's great people would want to store their value into a deflationary currency, because it gives more access to real valuable things.
I feel like the problem lies in the long term investments like start-ups,  research heavy industries, etc. and the overall economy which will be less productive since less people buy stuff, which will spiral into low employment and lesser productivity.

Get euros while in the US. Having that much cash on you is a bit dangerous too, but if you hide it well in different places you should be good. There should be old-style banking solutions for this too though, 20+% is pretty insane.
For bitcoin it's local bitcoins for now I think. You could also find some local vendor who takes bitcoin, contact them beforehand and you can likely work something out.

They are easy, and the reason they are easy is because it's very hard to know who's going to keep their promise and who isn't.
Neo &amp; Bee looked promising and had a decent business model. An official company with everybody's name in the open.
How does that compare with btc-e?
btc-e looks dodgy as hell, but they have a great track-record.
Take etherium. It's been pointed out there's nothing legally binding for them to do anything. Does that make it a scam? Should we not have Vitalik Buterin speak at conferences because etherium is a scam until proven otherwise?

As an American you can't play on Stars or Full Tilt, so the processing fee is not the case anymore.
The fee had all to do with the regulatory work arounds they had to make. IIRC full tilt lost 20 to 25% of the deposits to processing fees. (been a long time since I read about the case, so I might be off)
Because they had to deal with more shady processing companies.
But I do agree, Pokerstars has done deposit bonuses for certain types of deposits before (Maestro for my country), it's easy to see they would do a regular bitcoin bonus if they'd accept it.
Bitcoin would've been great a couple of years ago, since the US was banning payments to PS/FTP. Now there's licenses for gambling sites and whatnot, so it's not as beneficial as it once could be.

It depends on what you're trying to do.
If you want to scare people away from bitcoin just because whatever, you're doing a fine job.
If you want to inform people and let them make up their own mind, you need an article that fully explains bitcoin. 
Some opinion-pieces from people who actually have somewhat of an understanding of bitcoin might be nice too.
I guess the site (non-bitcoin) is not for me though, and I presume not for a lot of people in this place.

Since every single person in the chain likely doesn't want to go to jail they'll easily get to the original sender. If they don't, it's your ass that's going to jail, because buying an unknown package and selling it for more sounds dodgy as hell.

Off blockchain transactions help to keep the transaction volume low.
Last year transactions where at a high, now we're (presumably) at a low.
As said: people tend to stick to their coins. Most people buying bitcoins see it as an investment and don't play around with it. Bitcoin acceptance is not as big as you might think.
Although we get a lot of attention for merchants accepting bitcoin, in the grand scheme of things it's not that huge. In the first day of accepting bitcoin overstock got a massive response from the bitcoin community which ended up in about 800 purchases. 800 transaction is not that much.

The way you said is just very weird, aggressive and sometimes too simplistic.
It's not a computer system, it's a database/ledger. Everything in IT runs on electricity, it's weird to say this (and why?).
It's not absurd to think bitcoin will go away, it might be unlikely, but not absurd.
People in general get defensive and will protect their own viewpoint even stronger when you are offensive/aggressive. Don't say things like "you haven't got the slightest idea what bitcoin is"
For the same reason: don't tell them what they think when they don't clearly state this opinion themself.
The first and currently only serious use of bitcoin is currency. I wouldn't discard this as "just secondary use". Although I get why you're saying this.
Bitcoin wouldn't really work without the currency. You need to secure the network, and you need an incentive structure to do so. Most applications that will change the world are the ones that involve value and currency in some way or another as well.
The smartphone app paragraph is very aggressively written too imo. It's also a bit too abstract. If you give them an example of an app that could use bitcoin it would get the point across better imo.

A risk isn't proof.
My point is not that there aren't scams, and there aren't signs of them being a scam. It's the false positives.
What makes a legitimate business not a scam? Again I got the beautiful example of btc-e. There are many signs about btc-e that it might be a scam, but until further notice we can't say it is.
Should we therefor condemn btc-e and scream hell and fire when someone speaks good about it? Just because they have signs of being a scam?
Or should we just remind them that the company is run by anonymous people etc. and let them make up their mind on their own?
@_date: 2014-05-31 11:10:58
From a technical standpoint there are already better altcoins imo, but that doesn't really matter.
Because of the speed bitcoin companies developing it's rather impossible to have a better coin in every single way. Especially the ease of use.
But if it where possible I think it may have a chance.
However, introducing people to cryptocurrency tends to push them towards bitcoin, look at iceland, so the chance of failure would be fairly high.
Putting up a multi-billion endeavor with no direct gains other than brand recognition with a big chance of failure is not something someone will ever contemplate, so I think bitcoin is pretty safe in that regard.

This Mt.Gox disaster is incredible similar to Full Tilt. 
Company started by people who can't run a business got lucky in a niche market, grew too fast and let things get mindblowingly out of hand.
That said, there are a few key differences now, compared to the pokerstars buy.
The marketshare was pretty much split between FT and Stars. If someone else bought it, they'd had a competitor, now they pretty much own online poker.
Second important difference is that pokerstars was also facing large fines and prosecutions. They had incentives to pay back FT customers, because it makes for a good deal with the DOJ concerning their own company.
If the numbers we're seeing from the leaked documents are correct, the "brand" Mt.Gox isn't anything close to worth it.
That said, there might be a company that does acquire Mt.Gox, because the greater cause which is bitcoin, and the trust it would provide. But as a business decision Mt.Gox doesn't make a lot of sense.

As a consumer you don't know anything about the back-end of a payment processor, whether they encrypt their data or not.
I also want to point out this has nothing to do with bitcoin, this can be done with regular payment systems.
Have you ever used a fingerprint scanner? Do you honestly think that's more convenient as opposed to sticking a card in a machine, or in case of nfc pressing 'ok' on your phone?
I really don't get the sentiment some bitcoin people have that somehow, the 5 seconds it takes to pay for something is outrageous and totally inconvenient.
Nobody is waiting for a 0.5 second faster payment method.

about your edit, you can't get your profit in $ of course, value changes constantly.
I'm not great at math, but I'll just throw some numbers I found, they might not be correct, but should give some idea.

If all addresses have 1 BTC, this means there are 21 million addresses (you'll be searching way past 2140).
So you'll have to find 1 in 69595316063376329438270706319823000935996.
Assuming you'll check 1 billion address an hour you need about 69595316063376329438270706319823 hours.
For example sake we'll say 1 hour costs you 1 Satoshi, which means It'll cost you 695953160633763294382707 BTC to have  a 50% chance of finding an address.

Distribution is a downside to bitcoin, although I don't think it's a barrier to entry, let alone a huge one.
People buy apple stock now, fully knowing they're making early investors richer, it's not something that makes people shy away from something.
Also: google coin will have the same distribution errors, albeit on a larger scale. In a perfect world we give everyone in the world 10000 tokens and do proof of stake for the transactions.
However, we don't have the means to do that, and any distribution will be unfair.
Don't get me wrong, my first reaction to bitcoin was: it looks nice, but I'll wait around for google coin. Then I read about bitcoin ATM's being installed and that I can actually order pizza for bitcoin and I realized it's become too big, and too many sunk costs have been made for google to "outpay" bitcoin.
Plus it makes much more sense for google to incorporate bitcoin instead of making the same thing under their own name.

It's my point that you are not a deliverer if you are reselling the box. You don't get paid to deliver the box, you buy the box and you sell it to another person.
It is illegal for a "taxi" driver to buy a person and then sell him/her somewhere else.
It doesn't matter that you don't know what's in the box. You buy the box, at which point it's yours.
It also doesn't matter how the law works with it in theory. It matters how it works in practice.
If you bought a box full of drugs, nobody is going to believe you if you say you didn't knew what's in there. While if you where bringing it from point A to B, and get paid by company X to do so, that's a whole other story.

You also just said you're not going to get rich because everyone starts at the same time, while the only reason you think their own coin is better is because people can make larger amounts of profit. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

It's extremely hard to take someone serious after a random statement like that you know. Just as an aside.
Anyway, my point was that a lot of speakers are involved in start-ups, altcoins, etc. and it's extremely difficult to know for certain something isn't a scam (or has become one).

There are no dumb questions :)
Each time a block is found the one that found it gets a reward. If you fiddle with the block time more rewards are given, which means a higher inflation rate for bitcoin. And that would mess with the value of bitcoin (in that you can predict the inflation rate accurately)
You could halve the blocktime and halve the reward, but at this given time there's no need for that. It'll also require a hard fork, which is something to be avoided if possible.

If you run a mining operation that's under pressure of a government you're losing either way.
If bitcoin is huge there's a fairly large chance people will just accept certain transactions being blocked. At some point bitcoin grows beyond people that know anything about it.

- 8-ish developer teams need to change quite a bit to their implementation. Which costs extra time and resources.

@_date: 2017-02-05 14:53:21
I think that's a dangerous narrative.
Sorry to drag this on, but I think this kind of thinking keeps and furthers the divide we have in this community.
The beauty of open source is that anyone can read the code, and anyone can see what goes in, what goes out and what doesn't go in or out. 
What's important is the code, not who wrote it, not what political ideas the author has and not who's paying them. I can't remember the details but in the Debian development team there used to be a neo-nazi. While it did cause some controversy, he stayed part of the team because it's the code that matters, nothing else.
I think a good thought experiment is to imagine the development being done in the way MimbleWimble is being developed now: pseudonymous with Harry Potter characters. Now no one knows who's the real person behind certain code, no one knows who pays them and no one knows which motivation drives them. What has changed? There's no other option than to look at the code. There's no conspiracy theories on who pays who for what purpose, no person to judge for whichever political believes he has or which illegal substance he smokes.
That all said, I do think we need to realize the implications of the situation. For example privacy features is something that's hard to make money out of, so if development is fully privately funded those are the kind of things that may not get the attention that it deserves. Also given there's no benevolent dictator it makes it really hard to set a single path forward, which is worse for bitcoin as there's a need for consensus from the users.
I think it's perfectly fine to disagree with a certain path that is chosen, I myself don't agree with certain decisions that have been made in the past and I'd be very surprised if there's any bitcoin developer out there who doesn't have any personal dismay for certain features/decisions made in the past. What I don't think is fine is the moment we stop talking about content and start talking about motives and act according to what we think someones motives are instead of act on what we think is best.

It's a conversion to another currency, if something costs 10 dollars, people from Europe don't go: "Oh, that's 7 point three nine nine euros"
"That's about 7 euros" will do.
You see the amount in whatever currency when you pay in bitcoin, there's no need for someone to read the whole thing out loud.

bitcoin doesn't need to be sha256. It'll change if it's needed.
scalability is an issue indeed. people are working on it and hopefuly it'll be solved before it's too late. No single alt-coin has solved this problem in a decentralized matter either.
you assume an increase in volume, but a stagnation in price, fees and asics. If this really becomes a possible issue there's always the possibility to change how mining works.
If an alt-coin solves a real problem bitcoin has, bitcoin can adopt it. The real issues are with things no one has a solution for.

Lol at the comments here. "we have no beef, but fuck those guys" :p
Back when bitcoin classic was introduced there was a lot of spam from supports of it and the mods didn't know how to handle it, so they banned all links and "promotion" of it. Because of this censorship a lot of people moved to r/btc, however that place quickly became hostile towards everything that happened in bitcoin that wasn't a hardfork. People that didn't agree with that moved back to r/bitcoin and it really became an echo chamber where hate and personal attacks are not only allowed but encouraged. 
As we know,  hate only brings more hate,  so a lot of people go in defensive mode and shit on anything that's related to hardfork clients here. 
While the censorship here is pretty much gone, they stay on their island because they are the minority here. Creating a bigger and bigger divide, with extremer and extremer views on both sides.

There still are many developers and anyone can still join, there are more contributors than ever. You don't even need to 'join' anything, you just start to work. It's a lot of the same people that used to do this in their free time and a decent amount of developers still work on bitcoin in their free time, but the majority of code is written by people getting paid for it, which is logical because they have the time for it.
Besides, the people who do work on bitcoin in their free time often work for some bitcoin related company, which is logical because that's their area of expertise. It's likely they get influenced by the needs of the company.
As example Peter Todd: he works as a freelancer. He recognized a lot of the companies that hired him where in need of something like RBF. So he worked on RBF and eventually got opt-in RBF into bitcoin. His decision to work on this is still influenced by some companies, although he isn't an employee of anyone.
It's not only a logical consequence, it's impossible to stop. If the developers who get paid to work on bitcoin are unable to contribute, then bitcoin is owned by the people stopping them.
Linux is decades old and is doing pretty fine under this kind of system if you ask me.
I always get the feeling people want developers to live out of dumpsters, because otherwise some 'evil corporation' will influence bitcoin. These are just people like you and me with families, friends and most of all: a limited amount of time.
There's many ways you can keep big projects sustainable. Bitcoin is currently doing it via the Linux model. The bitcoin foundation failed, but for example Tor project.Inc still works as a non profit that employs a decent amount of developers. What I'm personally not a fan of, but if you feel bitcoin will be less owned because of it you can try and convince people to go with the BitTorrent model, which is a private for-profit company.
The blockchain isn't the only thing that needs to scale. Development needs to scale as well. You can pick any model and there will be ups and downs, but expecting every developer to live like Amir Taaki is just not realistic.

Bitcoin is still developed in an open source manner. Just like in the case of Linux a lot of developers are payed by companies in this space. Blockstream, Chaincode Labs, Ciphrex, BTCC, MIT Media Lab's DCI all fund Bitcoin Core contributors for their efforts in Bitcoin Core.
They probably seek to earn money via sidechains (like [Liquid]( and general expertise in the field. They've also acquired GreenAddress, a wallet software provider.
@_date: 2017-02-03 07:45:27
That's just not feasable for a big open source project like bitcoin. You're not going to get highly competent developers to work this much time on something, that's just not sustainable.
The most we can hope for is to have lots of companies doing this, so different features for way different use cases get build. Although at this time the most needed things are fixes and optimizations.

In the financial market they speak of "bears" and "bulls", investors being respectively pessimistic or optimistic.
A whale is someone with a lot of money. Not sure if it's also used in the financial world, but in the gambling world a whale is a fish (someone with fewer skills as the opposition) that has lots of money to burn :)
A few weeks back someone sold 30 000 bitcoins, creating a huge sellwall. So he was a bear... and a whale... so people called him the bearwhale.

Nothing is really truly trustless. Eyes can deceive and history is not always a prediction for the future.
Bitcoin itself isn't trustless either.
There's just amounts of trust. At some point the amount is so high people call it trustless.
This goes into a whole other discussion, but "trustless" is a buzzword used by bitcoiners to easily describe the ideas behind bitcoin. It's not a 'thing', really. If you google "trustless" all results you get are cryptocurrency related.

If you're losing sleep over an investment, you shouldn't invest. That goes for everything imo.
That said, the best way to secure yourself in an easy way is using a hardware wallet imo. Companies are black boxes, they can say they insure you, but you don't really know what's going on behind the curtains.
Trezor  and ledger wallet  are hardware wallets that come to mind.
I got the last one today actually, and it's very easy to use.
edit: you can use paper wallets too, but from my experience it's not really a comfortable feeling, because you're just relying on the generator to make correct keys. And you can't really spend fractions of it.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:49:27
That's not what he implied imo. He asked how many coins where Nlocked.
I don't think there are any tools atm to see how many there are, but the last 4 bytes of a bitcoin transaction involve Nlocktime, so any non zero value for the last 4 bytes is a lock-time transaction.

If you look at the last the last softfork BIP68 it was authored by 4 people, 1 of which is someone from the industry that doesn't contribute to any node implementation (afaik) and 2 who maintain their own implementation (Core+addrindex and NBitcoin). Addrindex is just build on Core, so you might call that not independent, but NBitcoin certainly is.
What would it take for you to change your opinion of "Core == Valid", outside of everyone stopping to run Core-based nodes (that's just the market, we can't control that).

It only gets included in 1 block, but all the blocks after that 'build' on top of that block. So in order to change the 1st block, they'd also have to recalculate the 2nd block on top of it.

I don't know enough about hardware backdoors to comment on that, all I know is that it's really hard to do, and most hardware backdoors are firmware based, therefor the firmware answers.
Almost all your questions got answered. When someone misreads your question, ask again more detailed.
I suspect it's actually possible to detect, because the chip is pretty common, however I do agree it's unlikely someone will actually take apart the device and test the chip manually.
The reason I think people trust them is because they have a solid business and cheating doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They would need to invest a whole lot in developing backdoor hardware that doesn't get detected softwarematically, they would have to gamble that no-one is able to detect it, that the information that this is not a genuine Cortex M3 chip doesn't get leaked by anyone in the process and that when they pull off the heist, they can actually get away with it.

If you're really confident you can short bitcoin if you want, but that's risky ofcourse.

Anyone correct me if I'm wrong but:
1) A bitcoin is an input on a decentralized ledger. What you're transferring to a USB stick is your private key, with that key you can prove that you are the owner of said input.
2) I'm not 100% sure on the technical details, but they don't have access to your keys. afaik they have an encrypted copy of it that only you can decrypt. The wallet generation does happen on their side, and that's where the problem was a couple of weeks ago when a white hat hacker swept some users money.
3) afaik that's the decryption.
4) see 1. A wallet is the key, the bitcoins are the inputs on the ledger.
5) There's a bit more to it technically, but in short: yes that's all that a transaction is.
6) Since numbers are seemingly random, it's impossible to never get a solution. If you roll a dice forever, it's impossible to never get a 6.
EDIT: as dskloet said though, we don't actually know. It's not going to be a problem though, since you can change the block you're working on.
7) Whenever a block is found miners will start working on the next block. That block includes whatever transactions they gather up to that point. If they're working on it for 5 minutes, the block includes all transactions they got within those 5 minutes, same for 6 minutes etc.
8) It is done during and after mining. If you are mining you want your transactions to be valid of course otherwise your found block will not be accepted by the network.
What they meant with that sentence though is that they check whether the transaction hasn't already been spent before (double spend).
edit: kudos btw for reading the white paper when discovering bitcoin. It's a step a lot of people skip.
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:08:15
Not that I don't get the point you're making, but your example is just saying buying 40 BTC is more expensive as buying 10 BTC.
For it to be the same you'd have to say guy A buys 40 BTC, which would result in a $21640 loss if he'd sold at $700.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:42:59
Fair enough.
Personally I think decentralized exchanges are the easiest way to solve the issue, and that one is a very hard nut to crack.
@_date: 2016-01-24 21:36:57
There is no tipping point, it doesn't work that way. Neither does the count of nodes matter that much, one can easily set up a ton of nodes or spoof the node count.  
Decentralization is a concept, not a metric.
It's hard to show data because correlation does not imply causation.   
All anyone can work with is simple game theory.

I think being afraid of making mistakes is a good thing.
Scaling up too fast is also something that shouldn't be taken lightly. 
Sure, I'd love for sidechains, invertible bloom filters and whatnot to be implemented, but every decision made in bitcoin is one that directly affects it's users and an entire economy in itself, it's not just a software choice.
That said, if you want to support development of the core protocol, there's an easy way to support developers with tip4commit

Bitstamp doesn't have any value from you storing your bitcoins there, so to be perfectly honest, you're an idiot for keeping your coins there "to show appreciation".

Truth is no one knows.
When the blockrewards halve, there's 50% less inflation. With the same influx of new money that means the price will soon double. However, no one knows what the influx of new money will be in the future, so one can only guess.
If you assume the influx will stay the same, it would be wise to invest earlier.

Look, I'd agree on disagreeing if vbenes said: omg, buy now all you can.
However, he said that IF you see a merit in bitcoin, you should buy VERY SMALL amounts, advising a dollar cost average, which is in fact a very good way to deal with the extremely volatile nature of bitcoin.
I personally find that decent advice, but if you disagree with that, feel free to respond with your argument on why you think this is not the case.

If you can't, than why do you assume it's the worst thing?
Deflation has become a bad word, because if currencies go into deflation, that generally means there's a collapse in demand, which is bad. That however doesn't mean a deflationary currency is bad.


There's plenty of deflation vs inflation articles, but I did express myself a bit too harsh I guess. You're right, this can go on forever, but it's just not an outcome we'd like.
Ideally we'd have a currency that forever holds it's value, but that's just never going to happen.

It counts the time since the coins that are moving, last moved.
So if you transfer 1 btc to an address, and 50 days later those coins move again, it counts as 50 days "destroyed".
It's a way of trying to measure the real transaction volume, because sending 1 btc back and forth 1000 times counts as 1000 btc in normal transaction volume, whereas in bitcoin days destroyed it doesn't make as big of an impact.
That said, exchange hot wallets usually receive and send the coins very fast, and those are genuine transactions, so read into it what you want.

Maybe it's not fair to be downvoted for that initial response, but I do think your concerns where answered fairly well.
When you're making an argument, try to understand why the other people are saying the things they say, and build on that, not repeat your own ideas.
Instead of ranting about US military etc., just ask them: how do I check with 100% certainty that the hardware isn't compromised?
That would actually lead to an interesting discussion, because I for one would like to know that.
Why not ask why people think it would be stupid of satoshilabs to do a thing like backdooring one in every X devices?  Instead of basically saying: did you miss the part where I expressed my opinion on that?

That's not what dollar cost average is. It's not buy in full and dig the hole deeper if you lose value.
You pick an amount you want to invest, and you spread it out over time instead of buying everything at once.
You might be confused with people on r/bitcoin, who're digging a deeper hole, selling their cars and whatnot and saying they're using the dollar cost average strategy. They're not, they're just bad investors.

It solves itself from an economical point of view, not from the mining difficulty.
The less hashrate there is, the more % of the total hashrate a miner has. So although there isn't a block every 10 minutes, they would still get a higher return because their stake in the total hashrate has increased.

There might be some misunderstanding with terminology.  
Most of the time, when people say "full node" they mean a node that is relaying blocks and transactions. It's those nodes that count towards the 5000+ amount of nodes.
If you run the standard node without opening up port 8333 you only download the transactions and blocks from the network, you're not participating. This gives you full security without the extra traffic of relaying. Those nodes don't show up on  
I assume that's what you're talking about? Or is it a bitcoin-core [SPV]( mode you want?
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:17:09
Full nodes relay transaction and blocks to other nodes, so you'll be sending transactions and blocks multiple times. These are in fact the bandwidth requirements for full nodes.

If it's a big feature they might make a mailing list post about it, to get feedback that way, and if it's a huge change they make a BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal).

This is one of the most impactful decisions for the future of bitcoin, simple should not be an argument.
What remains is to convince people how you're going to keep it decentralized (as the block-size could explode without the network being able to handle it well), why an always near-zero-fee transactions approach is best, why it's fine to give miners as a whole that power (why not do an ever more simpler miners-vote?)

There's often a step before it which is asking around if people like the general idea and if it has some obvious flaws in it.  
BIPs usually come with an implementation ready.
I think consensus is reached when there's no valid objection, which is different than the change being desirable. You can be totally new to bitcoin development and post a valid objection, and if people don't or can't refute your objection, there's no consensus.

There's still an attack possible though, since miners can choose transaction not held by anyone, but under normal circumstances it solves a lot of issues.
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:25:35
The Scaling plan now provides cheap transactions. Cheap on chain transactions is something that's hard to do without sacrificing certain things. Why would we focus on getting everything on chain, which needs certain sacrifices, if there are good other options to scale. Maybe lightning turns out not to work well in practice, but it would be stupid not to try. 
I think the quote of Ford (I think) applies very well : "if I would've asked people what they wanted they would've asked for faster horses."

Chinese miners have no problem connecting with other Chinese miners, just with the rest of the world. With weak blocks, IBLT, etc. these things are getting solved anyway. The weakpoint is mostly the latency, not connection.    
So it's very possible there could be blocks (or amounts of data) that can be mined efficiently but is too much to be handled by the average user who wants to run a node.

I don't know, you tell me, you're making the claim.
Heavily influential doesn't mean he controls it. What if Adam Back started scamming people? Would Bitcoin be a scam because a heavily influential guy is scamming?
Look, if you think it's a scam, be free to think so, but be aware it's up for interpretation, therefore people might question your intentions, even though they are good. I think we both want newcomers and non-technical people to stay away from Bitcoin Cash, but I don't think calling it a scam is the way to do it.

A controversial hardfork means the miners choose a change against the will of a decent (and unknown) proportion of the market. Which means miners have more power than initially anticipated.   
The market votes with their money. If people don't believe in it, people will stop regarding it as money. That's the part the market fulfills.   
What I think the issue a lot of developers would have with a controversial hardfork is that if a loud technical minority and a social media push can persuade miners to choose a certain path, bitcoin might not be as strong as initially thought.

Honestly, I don't like any number. I don't like the fact high numbers make veto's easy. I don't like low numbers for the risk of putting miners on a bad fork and how few individuals actually control that amount of hashpower.  
If I really had to pick something I'd go with a messy 95% for 1k blocks and increase the amount of blocks needed every 5% it goes down (down until 70% which will need 6k blocks)
10k really seems a lot. That's 70 days of 95% of miners producing blocks before the fork happens, that seems way too much tbh.

Is 8mb blocks not contrary to the desires of most of the core implementation developers?   
Code was presented that proposed change, other developers thought it wasn't a good idea. So they forked it with the change implemented, the change didn't get adopted by the majority of users nor miners, thus everything stayed the same. That seems like a pretty fair way of doing things to me, what more do you want?

There's no truth in this imo, just fundamental opposing visions.
For non-technical people with limited time it is extremely hard to paint a truthful picture for them self. I believe many people in this sub happen to believe the "right guy" by cheer accident/luck.
Bitcoin tries to discredit bcash as much as the other way around. Yes, Roger Ver and Craig Wright are a bit scammy from "our side" of view, but from the other side of view they are defending the truth against these "evil" bitcoin corporations, against the censoring powers that be.
It takes knowledge and especially time to find out who is deceiving who, because there's a lot of noise on both sides. Everyone is just trashing "the other side" and diminishing the criticisms of "their side".
It's because of the negativity towards others and a lack of constructive criticism that people like OP can't easily find the right information. It's easy to blame OP for not digging for truth, but maybe the bitcoin community is also a bit to blame for not having the platform to easily find truthfulness.

I know how lightning works, no need to quote people and link. 
Opening and closing transactions are on chain, but you don't know anything about the actual value transactions that happened. See my example. 
You can't say Alice paid Bob. All you know is that money went from Alice to Bob, but since that might just be routing of other transactions you simply don't know if Alice ever paid Bob. You also don't know anything about all the transactions that aren't published.
So you don't know anything about the majority of transactions because they are not published and the transactions that are published give you no information. So I'd say you can't track transactions like on chain.

Someone hacked the official Monero website and replaced the binaries with a version of Monero that stole their funds. So anyone that downloaded and ran the Monero software from the official site at the time got their funds stolen.
This is a known security issue, and something that can happen to the bitcoin.org website (or any site you download from) as well. Therefor it's important to check the hashes of the software you downloaded.
A hash function is a cryptographic protocol that outputs a number (or hash) for any given input. It's what makes Bitcoin work, mining bitcoin means that you make a hash of a certain proposed block and if your output (hash) has a certain amount of leading zeros in it, it gets accepted by the network to be the next block in the blockchain. Everyone can check it's a valid block by making a hash of the block and check if there are enough leading zeros.
With every release of new Bitcoin software the developers publish the hash of the software, so that everyone can check if their downloaded version is the exact same version than the one the developers have.
In case of Monero someone checked the hash of their downloaded software and noticed it didn't match. He reached out to the developers who then found out the website was hacked. He saved himself from theft by checking the hashes.

Yes. Like with pretty much any payment application both sides need to be online. This is a user experience problem, not really a fundamental one. It's different than on-chain indeed, but that's just a characteristic of lightning, not a problem.


As is, it can already cater to many users. There are armchair ideas of how to improve it beyond the current set-up, but there are currently more important things to work on. No reason why it can't be solved though.


If a country chooses to outlaw Bitcoin, you are in trouble for running a node, mining, accepting or sending payments, etc. We solve this by improving privacy. Same with Lightning. 


Is non-interactive security better than reactive, yes, of course. It doesn't mean it's a problem. It's just how lightning works and there's many ways, like watchtowers, to make the user experience better.


Exchanges get hacked all the time with on-chain transactions. How is this different? 


People are using it in production, so it IS production ready. There's a huge amount of work yet to be done until probably forever, just like people are still working on improving the internet, just like people are still working on making on-chain Bitcoin "production ready". The lightning network will never be "completed", neither will the internet, neither will the blockchain, that's just how things that need scaling work.

What in my mentor Monday response did you not understand?
To answer your short question: It depends on your spending habits. If you have many small inputs but only spend small amounts at a time, you'll hardly see a difference in total fees spent. If you spend it all at once you'll be facing a +/- $120 extra fee, or if you're not an idiot and wait around a bit you can probably take it down to about $30-$40.
So for someone who spends big the wallet is going to be worth less than for someone who spends small. Those coins aren't worth less, but the wallet might be for some people.

Are you just dicking around or are you genuinely that bad at economics?
Dicking around answer: Replace "lost" with "profit not made" in my reply, and probably everywhere in this topic.
Bad at economics answer: if a pool averages 5 blocks a day, earning 65 BTC, now runs software which is pretty much guaranteed to bug out some day they'll average 4 blocks a day+1 faulty block, earning 52 BTC. 65 - 52 = 13 BTC they lost that day.
You could add some extra variables like other pools running BU 1.0 bugging out before you do, odds of hitting the bug twice, etc. but I assume you get the main idea.

Again, it depends on what that "roughly same amount of time" is. If that time is "ASAP" you're talking about +/- $120, if that time is "some time in the next week" $30-$40.

I understand your point, but I think it's still fair to say LN enables 'billions of users'. After all, we're also talking about Bitcoin undermining governments, banks, etc. while we couldn't support even the smallest country to significantly adopt Bitcoin as a go-to currency.
You don't need such a radical increase. Not everyone will join at the same time and capacity is in a direct relation with amount of possible users. So if Schnorr signatures improve throughput by 30%, that means 30% more users without even touching the blocksize.

- Larger blocksizes mean there's more delay in block propagation, which means a higher orphan rate. Large mining pools/miners benefit from a higher orphan rate, as they are more likely to mine on top of their own block. (in the last years a lot has been done to increase block propagation speed)
- It will be harder/more expensive to maintain a node. Slightly by additional storage requirements, more heavily by the extra bandwidth requirements (there's still a lot of people with a data cap, even in western countries).
- Starting a new node from scratch will take a longer time. There's also a lot of progress made in this field, but all the low hanging fruit has been picked.
- There's a delay in the fee-market. Some people think it's time to introduce a fee-market, some do not.
- It's hard to come to consensus to what to raise the blocksize to. Everyone has a different ideal size in his mind. The best solution would be a mechanism that automatically adjusts the maximum blocksize, but so far there's no general agreement how to do that.
- We still have a lot of ways to safely and securely scale without increasing the blocksize. Things like schnorr signatures.
- A blocksize increase beyond segwit needs to be done with a hardfork. There's no agreement on how to do a hardfork, what the hardfork should include besides a blocksize increase, etc.
Given the progress in a lot of fields most are fine with the increase segwit provides, but beyond that there's no real foundation to increase it further anytime soon.

And that's exactly the reason why it's not important to keep bitcoin "easy" (not sure why you think it's easy, but w/e) and cheap (to transact). You don't need Bitcoin. The trade-off you're making is choosing a path where the people who actually need it, who are losing percentages of their wealth by the day, who are being prosecuted for transacting with people or organisations the government don't like, are getting lesser utility out of Bitcoin because you want to keep buying cheap steam games, which you could've done in many other ways.
I'm not saying 2X will destroy the ability to run your own node, or will destroy anonymity, but it won't solve much either. We don't need Bitcoin to compete with legacy banking right now, what's more important is to enable the people who don't even have access to the legacy system. I'm sure you can survive a few years of buying your steam games with paypal/creditcard/debit card/etc. in favor of people who actually need it.

Miners' reward gets halved pretty often since the Bitcoin price fluctuates so often and hard. There's really not much difference between the price going down 50% in a few days, and a reward halving, other than the reward halving being something that is predictable.

There's a decent amount of differences in the BU software, but if it truly was basically the same, the sheer amount of developers and reviewers would be a clear indication of the better software.
I think friction is good if we're talking about things that give me financial loss. Just like the wallet gives me friction when I try to send a transaction with a really big fee.

Everyone experiences orphaned blocks, therefor your loss effectively equals zero, as those losses are experienced by everyone.
If you intentionally orphan your own blocks you lose that value on something no one else experiences, so it's pure loss and a big deal.

Houses, cars, companies, travels, etc. If you got $1B, that's it, you made it. At that point you should be doing something you want to do, and chances are that something isn't staring at graphs all day long.
If you seek posts about early bitcoin holders the most recurring theme is: I sold at $xx, because profit was nice, hindsight 20/20 wish I didn't. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:54:22
There's market manipulation in Bitcoin as well, is it therefore a scam? What if Satoshi came back, sold his coins and said: "I created it for the profit"? Would it then be a scam?
Someone calling it a scam is an absolute worthless piece of information. Nobody is learning anything. If someone doesn't know anything, and one side calls it a scam, the other side calls it a corporate take-over, or whatever the latest narrative is, that someone has no information other than you seemingly have to pick a side. There's plenty of non-crypto people calling Bitcoin a scam, but the only thing it achieves is people wondering why, and they're like: let me check this thing out to see if it's actually a scam.  
Educate, don't push people, cause you might push them towards the other side, which at this point is a disaster waiting to happen just from cheer hashrate alone.

We have better solutions, that's the point. Besides, we have a blocksize increase in 2 weeks, so we've done that.
I don't know if Satoshi actually said anything was impossible, but afaik he or anyone else at that time never mentioned: decentralized payment channel network, Schnorr signatures, signatures aggregation, coinjoin signature aggregation, drivechains/sidechains, braiding, client-side validation/tree-chains.
The overwhelming majority of developers don't think increasing the blocksize/weight via hardfork is urgent. Most of that majority is not employed by blockstream. 
Blockstream didn't create drama. More than 2 years ago Gavin Andresen started making drama stating very bad things will happen if Bitcoin will hit the blocksize limit and it should be increased urgently, a statement most developers disagreed with. We're now 2 years further and despite the delay of the segwit blocksize increase Bitcoin is just fine and no bad things have happened (other than more drama).
I propose for future discussions we stick to facts and numbers, not "Satoshi said X 7 years ago". Satoshi also implemented transaction replaceability, but looking at your posting history you don't support replace-by-fee. I think what Satoshi said doesn't have a place in a nuanced and technical discussion, and certainly not if you just pick and choose whatever you like and dismiss the rest.

Given half the earth's population isn't even on the internet we'll not need those kind of numbers any time soon. Loads of things can happen meanwhile to scale better as well.

2nd layer applications like the lightning network are being developed, which will push bitcoin transactions off-chain safely. You can also run a pruned node, which deletes the historical data.
There's efforts to make transaction-sizes smaller, so more transaction per byte.
Side-chains, which allows for bitcoins to be transferred to other blockchains offer another solution.

It's likely we'll have a system where pruned nodes archive parts of the blockchain which they advertise via the P2P network. So that basically a 1TB blockchain can be downloaded from 100 10GB pruned nodes.

That's not a technical issue, so it certainly doesn't need any fork. From a technical level there is no such thing as bitcoins, there's only satoshis. It's wallet software that converts satoshis to BTC.
Many wallets offer a choice between BTC, mBTC, µBTC, bits or Satoshis, however there's not really a community consensus about moving to something else and what to.
@_date: 2017-01-30 07:17:28
This is about satoshis design, not about what currently is possible and how to move forward. There's enough opportunities to discuss block size, not every topic needs to be about that.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:15:19
You should update your software. That's also the reason why you only have 2 connections.  is the latest.
You can also prune the blockchain as said by u/djbunnies . This will make the blockchain something like 3GB in size.


Unless you copy/paste your private key is some chatwindow or something, there's not a lot you can do wrong. But I do understand your concern. I'd recommend updating Core and just syncing it and send everything to a light wallet.

Please keep the 'one line of code' talk to people who actually can code and know what they're taking about. This is something that could be done, however it would decrease the incentive to decrease utxo size. It's also difficult to implement in mining software as there's now 2 metrics and you need some sort of algorithm to toss out segwit transactions in favor of old transactions when the 4mb limit is reached in order to get the most fees. 
No one brought up this 'problem', it was pointed out you shouldn't talk about 2mb for a 4mb/8 mb increase. No one said 8mb is infeasible (although that's very arguable, but it's you who brought up this problem) .

No, because lightning is bitcoin. It's like segwit transactions, bitcoin merchants move towards the new thing, it doesn't need adoption from scratch.  
Besides, your premise was it still needs to be designed (which is clearly false as the specifications are final) and needs to be tested (there's a testnet network going on alpha 0.3, next version probably being a beta). So it's a guess based on nothing, which is fine by me, but don't pretend you're basing your guess on anything technical.

It depends on a lot of factors. How long are you prepared to wait, current transaction volume, etc.
If you want it to confirm in the next block I'm very roughly guessing you'd be paying around $120 in fees. If you time it a bit you can probably do it with $30-ish or something. If you wait until segwit you can do much better probably.
Just giving a ballpark here, you can calculate precisely if you really want.

51% could/would be viewed as an attack, and while it's possible to do so, it's not without consequences.
Miners do what the users want, if only 51% of users want it, it's a potential loss of 49% of income for them so it might not be a good idea.
Setting the threshold at 50% also gives a lot more power to developers, as now they only need to convince half of the miners something is a good idea. Setting the threshold to 50% makes it so that a kind of bitcoin, that only 12.5% of users want, is only 3 softforks away.

Your quote is not a ideology, it's a simple fact. Bitcoin can't scale in the current configuration. That's why people are working hard on solutions. Solutions that Satoshi Nakamoto didn't think off.
I'm sure the inventor of the internet didn't have a ready to go answer on how to scale towards streaming 4k video. Although there was probably a vague thought that it would be possible by just faster computers and modems. Later people invented all kinds of ways to more efficiently compress, send, encode, etc. these things.
The older Bitcoin gets, the more Satoshis vision is away from reality. There's many things we now know we can do, that Satoshi didn't think we could (or had no knowledge of), and there's many things Satoshi thought was possible but which turned out to be impossible as of yet.

Because by the definition of leadership that most people use, there is no leadership in bitcoin.
The reason being that by the definition that you use, everything is run by leadership, which imo makes it a bad definition. Ultimately it doesn't really matter what your definition is, as long as you can provide a better way to do it. Given the constraints of amount of resources available I think bitcoin is currently doing a really great job of staying as far away from true leadership as it can.

That's because 2MB is not bad. What's bad is the process, timing, lack of any other technical improvements or bugfixes and an overall total disregard of all the research done surrounding hardforks.
There's a growing number of devs who feel like spoonnet is the way to go. The spoonnet proposal is a result of lots of back and forths over the last 2 years implementing needed changes, yet trying to be as compatible as possible. X2 implements exactly 0 changes most devs think should be included in a hardfork.
That's how things are supposed to go: You make a proposal, get feedback, adjust your proposal to the feedback, make a new proposal, make an implementation, get review, adjust the implementation to the review. Do you think Core contributors never get bad feedback? You think whatever they do gets in the code? No, they get feedback and work together to create the best solution for the problem.
That's two years of work and heavy thinking, resulting in the conclusion a hardfork version should be released at least 18 months in advance, it should not depend on miner signaling, should include a flexible and extended header, should have a dedicated space for miners which is ignorable by users and merge=mine friendly, adjust the transaction weight formula, include a linear growth of blocksize, fix the Sighash O(n^2) problem for non-segwit outputs, it should use the sign bit of the header nVersion, the witness merkle root is put in the header, should have a broad consensus in the community.
Now segX2 chooses to ignore all that and goes: let's do the 2 year old BIP102. I think there's only one response any decent developer can have and that's: LOL

It wouldn't be worth it, but I assume there's outdated mining hardware that make more than a couple hundred bucks. I have no clue about prices of these things, but I assume miners that run at 50% of normal break-even point aren't worth much. That's still a lot of hashpower.
Not only that, but with the growth of renewable energy we're going to see more instances of negative prices, meaning electricity companies are paying to get rid of their energy, so there's an extra profit that way.

I don't see how this contradicts, so no. 
See replace-by-fee. The first proposal was full-RBF, which got a decent amount of criticism. That doesn't mean developers would never want RBF, they didn't make a public statement about how they don't mind the general idea of transaction replacement, they just outed their concerns about the proposal at hand. Most developers couldn't care less about RBF, but someone did the work, listened to the feedback that was provided, and now we have opt-in-RBF. That's how things are supposed to work.
There are hundreds of things developers would like to see/don't mind in Bitcoin. Should they make statements about every single one of them? 
They obviously support a blocksize increase, because one just activated.
Again, there's a growing consensus about [spoonnet]( as well as loads of [research/talk]( surrounding hardforks, as well as [feedback to the current X2 proposal]( What more criteria do you want?

It's something you could argue about, but I believe that if bitcoin becomes widespread governments and banks will not play along. Which might mean people having money with these companies or having dealt with these companies will be at risk.

Thanks to tcrypt I (might) understand what you're trying to say. Maybe if you didn't act like a 12 year old I would've known straight away.
The problem with multiple implementations in blockchains is that the consensus mechanism relies on everyone following the same rules. If because of a bug an implementation follows different rules it will fork off, leaving the consensus chain with possibly large financial consequences. In the LN there is no blockchain or consensus mechanism, if 2 implementations are incompatible they will just stop talking to each other and close the channel (if it's been made already).

That's nice and all, but we're all responding to the post linking to the wikipedia page, which states:
"In the computer industry, vaporware or vapourware is a product, typically computer hardware or software, that is announced to the general public but is never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled."
So what google says is of no importance if someone is linking to that definition.
Besides nitpicking over definitions, we all know the connotation of the word vaporware. Yes, maybe you can call LN vaporware by some definition, but what are you really trying to say? What do you provide to this topic by saying it's vaporware? We both know LN is here to stay, we both know you can run multiple implementations on testnet, at this point there's no value you can provide by saying it's vaporware.
I understand that you don't like LN or the way it's presented in this space. There's however no reason to say it's vaporware, and certainly not as a response to someone asking for a link to the github page (that wasn't you, talking in general). I'm not going around reddit replying to every alternative blocksize post saying: "bigger blocks are vaporware because we don't have bigger blocks yet, so by some definition I can call it vaporware!".
It's not about what you _can _ say, it's about what you should say. You should say things that are relevant, contribute to the conversation, alternative viewpoints, etc. Saying: 'this is vaporware, and don't say I can't say it's vaporware because by this definition it is true' adds as much to the conversation as saying: 'oranges are orange!'

The higher the price of bitcoin the more electricity is going to be burned as the reward for burning the energy is denominated in bitcoin.
If the price goes 10x, the electricity consumption goes 10x as well (with a big delay/smooth-out). Only thing that counters that is the halvening.
It's a bit skewed as chip manufacturing and research etc. eat into their bottom line as well, so it won't be 10x, but there will still be a heavy correlation.

Mining is creating blocks by doing computational work. Those blocks contain transactions. Soooo... yes.. kinda


There's no THE mempool, every node has a different mempool, although a lot of them will look fairly similar.


When you just start your node it's first come first served (unless your settings are rejecting certain transactions). If your mempool is full (max. allocated total size) transactions with smaller fees get removed in favor of higher fee transactions. There are transactions that are not likely to be picked up by any node (0-fee transactions for example) indeed.




Blocks are created by doing computational work on a mathematical problem, on average once every 10 minutes someone will find a solution to the problem. Blocks contain the answer to that solution (which everyone can verify), transactions, plus an extra transaction where the one who publishes the block is allowed to send 12.5BTC to any address he wants without an input (thus newly created).


If bitcoins are send to an address no one has a private key for. (like 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE)


The key is not being sent. The key allows you to sign a transaction proving that you own that key, without revealing the key itself. This means only the person with that key can create transactions that spend those certain bitcoins.

You don't need specialist hubs. Anyone can route transactions, it's not that much of a heavy duty software. Some people think the companies who do lots of transactions will be doing a lot of routing as they have many connections and therefor act a bit as a hub, but you don't need hubs.
You don't need to "sign up", you just need a open a channel and they will route transactions for you (or for whoever you are routing for) to anywhere. The "worldwide" part is what makes the "network" part of lightning network. Otherwise it would just be a payment channel, which exists for years now.
It's not really a good analogy imo, since it has layers. Lighting is a  decentralized network, so there's no different layers, no hub-to-hub-only parts. 
Either way, there's loads of information out there on how it works, I'd recommend youtube videos like

Please... If you have questions, just ask them and we can discuss further from there. There's no need for conspiracy theories build on answers you made up in your head.
From your post I can distinguish 2 questions:


No, this is about the memory pool, which is where transactions are held that didn't confirm yet.
If a transaction doesn't have RBF enabled and uses an output that's already been used by a transaction in the nodes memory pool it will ignore that transaction so it won't relay the double-spend attempt. If after 3 days the transaction is still not confirmed it gets removed from the memory pool, so if there's a double spend attempt after those 3 days every node will view the double spend as a new transaction (as it doesn't have the original anymore). That means _ in theory _ 14 days is better against double spends than 3 days.
In practice however, as been said by Gmaxwell, double spends are easily done after 1 day anyway, and transactions that expired often get rebroadcast by 3rd parties. So it's not going to make any impact on 0-conf, but if it where it would be a positive impact, not a negative.


No funds are being locked up. As mentioned above, if your transaction has a too low fee, this won't impact your ability to double spend it.
The memory pool is also used to estimate fees for the wallet. Companies and heavy users [already]( wait until off-peak times, which often means once a week. If the wallet wants to offer this functionality of confirming in the off-peak time somewhere during the week it needs to know the fees of the entire week so it can estimate a fee that will confirm within a week. This will have no impact on higher fee transactions, they'll still confirm quickly. It's just to give users the extra option to lower their fees without manually watching the fees in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:37:58
That's not how it works.
Either there is mathematical consensus that keeps the set of rules, or there isn't.
OP said "backed by math" doesn't mean anything as all software is math but still hackable. You claim consensus fixes that, while it certainly doesn't. See Ethereum, just because it works with a consensus mechanism doesn't mean it can't get hacked.
Bitcoin is backed by math in terms of private keys, and proof-of-work, but the rules the network follows is purely code, so all software that can be hacked. There is a reason developers are so careful introducing new features.

Segwit fixes malleability. Malleability needs to be fixed because otherwise you could close a channel with a malleated transaction without the other party noticing.
Technically you could still do it (blockchain.info did this with their thunder network), but it would require you to trust the other party not to do any shenanigans, and that's not as useful as a no-trust-needed system.

How long will it take before they stop bothering keeping it under their control?
At any time the company or VISA/mastercard can stop processing your transactions or forbid you for transacting with certain countries/institutions.  They can monitor your transactions and give them to governments, sell them to 3th parties or get hacked. Every time you give out the card details you are at risk of card theft.
The only feature it really gives you is the ability to easily convert part of your bitcoin investment into fiat. Which is a feature you should only be needing if you have invested more than you can afford to lose, which is not a good thing anyway.
It's great for people who earn their money in bitcoin or just convert it all, and it might have some other small use-cases, but to call this anything close to the LN is just insulting to the entire idea of bitcoin imo.

There's no true anonymity, just degrees of anonymity. Right now there's a really low degree of anonymity in Bitcoin.
There are many ways to increase anonymity. Schnorr signatures and MAST or things that help anonymity and work will probably start on that when segwit gets activated.
Side-chains, lightning network, confidential transactions might be next.
Very long term mimblewimble might provide some solutions.
Probably forgetting a ton of things that are being worked on or are in the pipeline, but: there's a lot of work being done.

Not really the best subreddit to ask for downsides of bitcoin ;)
As said by others, it's beta, it's an experiment. Nothing like this has ever been done, it's unmarked territory. We don't know how mining will evolve, we don't know how heavy influence from governments will affect it, we don't know if it'll be able to survive a major security flaw, we don't know if it'll be able to withstand quantum computing, we don't know how community splits will act out and influence the future.
Bitcoin is still a risky investment, while it's ok to invest some in more risky things, overextending is probably not a good idea. Think of the people who bought in 2013 at $1150 and saw the price go to sub $200 a year later. Would you be able to handle your savings decreasing in value by 80% with no sign of improvement?

The "civil war" has calmed down, but there's still disagreement on how to move forward after the upcoming changes.
- Checklocktimeverify and checksequenceverify have been activated by softfork. 
- Segregated witness is developed and currently waiting for miners to update to be deployed. It removes malleability, enables script-versions, effectively increases the blocksize to +/- 2Mb plus some extra technical improvements.
- In Bitcoin Core transactions are verified with the libsecp256k1 library, which is way faster than openSSL
- You can choose to create transactions that enable the ability to replace the transaction with a higher fee as long as it's not confirmed. via opt-in replace-by-fee
- the priority system is disabled, so it's pretty much impossible to get transactions without a fee confirmed.
- BIP152, compact blocks, which reduces bandwidth spikes and often results in faster block propagation.
- Child-pays-for-parent is enabled, which means you can make a transaction confirm faster if the output is used in another transaction with a higher fee.
- Softforks now use BIP9, which enables softforks to be deployed simultaneous.
- Lightning network is being in development, which is a network of payment channels, which should result in a trust-free, cheap, hugely scalable way to do bitcoin transactions off-blockchain.

People are crying because their wallet failed to predict a good enough fee. People expect their wallet to make accurate predictions, but it's a hard problem to solve, so sometimes the wallet fails.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:24:45
If the transaction isn't a useful spend, then indeed it's just an extra transaction that could've been spared from the network. But using that mechanism is still a good reason imo.
Child-pays-for-parent isn't a solution of any kind, it's a quick-fix for people who want a really fast confirmation because the software they used didn't predict the fee accurately enough.
There's an unlimited amount of use-cases for nearly free time-stamp/value-transfers, so I don't think expanding capacity at a cost is the way to go. Increasing on-chain capacity should be done as a last resort imo, which is hard to do, since you need to develop and deploy it which needs time, but if segwit activates somewhat soon-ish I think we'll be just fine.
I don't think it's a problem companies and wallets experience a competitive fee-market. They can see the problems they have and fix them right now. Just like transaction malleability companies seem to need the experience before they seek solutions.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:57:08
But that would be like blaming gravity. If you don't have an alternative, it's just something you have to accept.
You have to accept that people get together to combine their effort and not waste time, money and energy on things that won't get accepted anyway. That does mean they have a decent amount of power over the priority of things, which isn't perfect, but... what else are you going to do?

These are statistics companies/individuals post about their own mempool. If there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions with large enough fees everyone's mempool will increase. Maybe not to the same size depending on settings/connections, but it'll increase.
There are many different sites where they show their own mempool:
- 
- 
- 
- 
You'll notice these are all slightly different in size, but follow the same pattern of high and lows.


I'm not an expert on the exact workings, but I should be in the ballpark.
There's different ways of doing this, but most of the time "miners" don't even run a node. They get a hash of all transactions from the mining pool, do the hashing work, but they don't know which transactions they are mining for, so they'll never be able to publish the block them self.
There's also solutions like [P2Pool]( that do require miners to run a node and create their own transactions. The downside is slightly higher latency, which means higher risk of [orphaned blocks]( which means slightly less profit in the long term.  (The wiki for P2Pool should give you the answer for how they solve the problem you describe, can't remember myself exactly)


That's very correct indeed. 
Bitcoin is full of "bad" names for things. It's called bitCOIN, but there aren't really "coins". It's a "wallet", but really it's more like a "keychain" holding your keys.

Let us please not scale like existing technologies.
It's nearly impossible to be anonymous on the internet, governments are finding more and better ways to control access to the internet. If it had had scaled slightly more carefully we'd have end-to-end encryption all the way.
Intel and AMD both have backdoor cores build into their CPUs. If moore's law had been slower we might have had a plethora of choices (might).
Let's learn from the mistakes and not put scale above any other value. Let's keep the core principles of decentralization, anonymity, p2p in the front of our minds. 
Developers have worked very hard to improve the technology to support the segwit blocksize increase, let's not pretend nothing has happened either.
Flex caps still suffers from the additional power it gives miners. The incentives to make the blockchain scale and make it as profitable as can be to mine are not aligned with the values of it's users, who like bitcoin to be anonymous, p2p, decentralized.

Both. Giving users more fee options on the lower side will naturally make the highs lower and the lows higher. Which is good for fee estimation as a whole and the network as a whole.
To give this option of confirmation within a week to users, weekly metrics are needed.
You can't give users more fee-choices without having the metrics for it or without it having an impact on the fee market is a whole. Since this is something users want from the wallet, and it stabilizes the fee market more, the upsides are clear. The reason this was brought up in the meeting was to ask for possible downsides.

1. What kind of information would you find valuable (as you explained in a comment you think people will cheapen their channel to gather this information)? You see money coming in from one end (who may or may not give away his IP address), and see it going out the other end. You don't know if the input is the sender of the transaction or just another link in the chain and you don't know if the output is the recipient or just another link in the chain.
2. Given the fact you lock up funds it would make sense not to have all eggs in 1 basket. It also literally pays to have more channels open.
3. and 
4. is assuming 2, which is wrong imo.
5. You can [outsource]( this. Even if you couldn't it wouldn't make it more costly. Watching 1 channel is just as costly as watching 100.
6. In that situation it would make sense to open up a channel with the recipient, not with a 3rd hub. Again, this is another reason why more channels is better, you are connected better. I think it's fairly unlikely no path will be found anyway.
If we're going to talk about privacy I think mobile wallets are a better subject.

This way old nodes who failed to update will see the blockchain go on as usual, but without transactions. This makes it safer because those people will never be scammed by people mining on the old chain.
The downsides are afaik mostly political. With a new chain everyone on it supports that chain. With this system it's a bit like a softfork, it's opt-out instead of opt-in.

You can mine with the Core client (or any derivatives), but it often happens with custom build software.
There are no developers who can change the blocksize. Developers can implement changes, and those changes can be adopted by the users and miners. Whether those changes are introducing a new OP code, increasing the blocksize or changing the 21 million cap.
Because those are the rules we agreed upon. He who publishes a block with a high enough difficulty and valid transactions is regarded as the new block. The hash of the previous block is also included in the block, which is the way the blocks are linked.

In the case of softforks you are dragged along as well, it also defaults to acceptance. Granted, you can still use it, but you have no option of remaining under the old rules (as a user).
The rules have been changed many times. If I want to use high S values, I'll have to fork bitcoin because I'll be dragged along with the softfork.

(replying to a combination of this answer and answers to DanielWilc)
Just because it doesn't break backwards compatibility doesn't mean I am not dragged along with the changes. Tuned-out sysadmins will be accepting the segwit changes for example. The same arguments can be used.
The social contract of bitcoin is also not: "expect that at some point in the future your transactions will have no value and not be accepted by anyone, and then you will have to find out why and make a very political choice about how to proceed."


How will you define "everyone" in a way that is impossible with an opt-out system, but possible with an opt-in system? The only difference I see is in the situation when miners go against public interest, but the same concerns in that situation are true for softforks. Right now miners can do any softfork, that's a power they have and the only thing that we can do about that is fork away from the miners. Which is also an opt-out system.
It's nice that you put a lot of work into these softforks, but if miners choose to adopt some softfork code by a single loony, that's the way the network is going to go until we can fork away.

ELI5 version: The price is always the last trade that has been made. Say someone puts up 1 bitcoin for sale for $900. Someone else buys that bitcoin for that price and a trade is made. Now the price gets adjusted to $900.
All exchanges operate independently, however there's people trading on multiple exchanges, and if people sell/buy bitcoins at a higher/lower price on one exchange than the other those traders take advantage of that difference. This is called arbitrage and makes the exchanges more or less follow the same price. When it's hard to get fiat currency in or out an exchange, or because other fees/hurdles the price difference can be higher (this is now the case with BTC-e and the price in India)

No. The 12-word seed from blockchain.info is a mnemonic for your identifier and/or password, not a HD-wallet. Even if it was, it wouldn't be a good idea. Key generation is the most important aspect of creating a wallet. Blockchain.info has a history of bad key generation. Your keys would also be generated on a device that's possibly compromised. That's one of the advantages of Trezor, even if your device is compromised, you're still able to safely generate a new key.  
The way HD-wallets work is that you generate new addresses deterministically, so all the old receiving addresses are re-generated if you restore your HD-seed.
EDIT: turns out they do use HD-wallets these days, so it depends when your blockchain.info wallet was created, but just like u/kinoshitajona said: it's a bad idea to do it anyway.

The reason we have hardware wallets in the first place is because we can't securely put keys on online devices.
The reason we have lightweight mobile wallets is because full nodes demand too much resources.
If you want these things together you'll have the negative impacts for which these devices were created in the first place.
You can set up your blue wallet to connect to your own node, so you can have best of both worlds there, although in separate devices. But you can't really have an always online device also being an always offline device at the same time. You can ducktape them together if you really want a single device.

Are you really suggesting not to do a blocksize increase just to prove a point?
There where tests showing 20mb would cause problems. There where tests showing 8mb is the absolute max., no error margin allowed or clients that weren't as fast as Core. No-one seems to agree on how to do a hardfork, there's hardly any thought that has gone into what should also be included in the hardfork.
Something like bitcoin shouldn't be about compromising. It should be about seeking a common path to move forward. Since this is nearly impossible for big changes the people that need to compromise are the ones that are on the outskirts of the debate, in this case people like Luke-jr who think 1Mb was already too big, and people like Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn who think 8Mb blocks and hardforks just to do that is fine.

Development is and will still continue without segwit. So no.
What does get stalled is the on-chain scaling. It took a year to get segwit ready, and since there's not even close to consensus how and if we should do hardforks, let alone what those hardforks should contain, it's going to take a long time to get something else done to increase on-chain scaling.
I agree that puts a decent amount of pressure on the miners to actually run it, but then again, almost everyone wants the changes that segwit provides. Not everyone might agree on how we got there, or the priority of it, but there are hardly any reasons not to do it at this time.

You can do that as well. If you can't do that it's technically not really an exchange, but a company that's the in between exchanges and you (or in case of coinbase an easy interface that's powered by an underlying exchange (GDAX)).
When you sell or buy instantly you are making a "market order", which means that whatever the highest price someone will buy, or the lowest price someone will sell is, that's the price you get.
When you set your own price it's called a "limit order", meaning you indicate a price that you are willing to sell/buy and whenever your price is the lowest/highest someone offers you get matched with someone buying/selling at "market price".

Unfortunately for you, this is not a story about solution X or Y, it's a story about A, B, C, X, Y and Z. If bitcoin wants to scale up we'll need all the solutions we can get. Which includes LN, sidechains and whatnot.
There's no one forcing you to use bitcoin. There are 300+ altcoins, I'm sure you'll find a currency that suits your ideals.

Not really. Quoting Dave Hudson here:
"Yes, but the block maker won't publish the second block it finds for the same 
set of transactions. It won't orphan its own block. In fact even if it does it 
still doesn't matter because the block maker still gets the block reward 
irrespective of which of the two solutions are published.
It's not about which hash wins, the issue is who gets paid as a result."
Although it's really unprofessional, I understand why he's so edgy on this.

@_date: 2015-08-18 11:00:37
Ideally the bitcoin-fee should be slightly more expensive than the LN fee, to incentivize people to use LN.
Since the blocksize is not dynamic that might result in really high fees at times indeed. Which is another problem to solve. Once we get to that point, there might be a lot of changes though. You can't really predict how much a low fee market is needed if we don't know how/why/where the LN-hubs will operate, whether there are solutions found to scale bitcoin without further centralization, etc.

XT only starts after 75%+ of miners run it, and after a specific date. You'll know in advance if and when this will happen.

It's new, and the censorship issues lead to more exposure, so it's all over the place now.
I hope and assume it'll settle down after a few days. Every argument that's been made has been reiterated numerous times, so there's not much left to discuss. People have chosen their side a long time ago, so now you just run whichever node you prefer, and that's that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:23:35
When you make a transaction you send money towards the receiver and towards a change address which is controlled by you. If someone knows you control the address of the sender, they can often very easily find out which is the change address and therefor know you control that address as well. For example if there's multiple inputs, say 1 BTC and 0.5 BTC and the output is 1.1 BTC and 0.4 BTC they know the 0.4 output is the change address, because otherwise you could've just used the 0.5 input without the 1 BTC input.  
If there's one big input and the output spends a small amount which exchanges close to round $ figure they can also reasonably assume the large output is the change address.
A big problem mixers have is that if they just take all the inputs, mix them and send them to outputs it's very easy to know which outputs belong to which inputs because of the amounts. If 1 BTC goes in, you know somewhere 1 BTC minus fee has to come out.
@_date: 2015-08-18 11:45:56
At some point in time we need different solutions.  
Bitcoin can practically run at 3 tx/s max. right now (7 is the theoretical maximum), which is terrible for any usecase that has the word "global" in it. Bumping it to 24tx/s is nice for us early people, but in the grand scheme of things it's just as terrible.
Anything that has the word global in it can't run on lightning with 1 mb blocks either. Everything is needed, and everything needs to scale.

I've read the thread, I'll give my thoughts on it.
KevinKelbie is right, you can open a channel where the funds go directly towards one person. In fact, it's the most likely way channels will be opened. High value transfers will likely be on chain though, lightning makes the most sense for smaller transactions. 
There's a user-adoption issue here indeed, but in the case where your employer pays you via lightning I think it's safe to assume there's enough adoption. If you want to make on chain transactions still, just don't put everything in a channel.
Your initial reasoning is wrong: _" I put $800 in the channel cause eventually it will cost me a total of $40 in fees and that works out to 5% in fees total."_  
You can continue to use this channel as long as it's open for both receiving and sending. So you might receive funds from your employer via this channel and you might pay your phone bills via this channel. This channel might stay open for 10 years in which it has transacted $400000, for which the $40 fee is just 0,01%. (with the paper that's now on the [frontpage]( those fees might be reduced significantly btw)
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:15:35
You just made it sound like LN is a part of bitcoin that you'll all have to accept, which is not. If you like p2p instead of a hub-system, continue to use bitcoin by all means.

0 -confirmation transactions might become a bigger topic.   
Anonymity features might become bigger.

From a bitonic article: "Bitonic’s first bank was ING, which took a punt on them when other banks were more sceptical about bitcoin. They now have accounts at three of the four big banks in the Netherlands: ABN Amro and SNS Bank, as well as the aforementioned ING, says Kleiman."

How would that deal have looked? It's not really a secret what most developers want in a hard fork, 2X chose to do not a single one of it. Which means they either have no single clue of all the work being done in Bitcoin, or they know but choose to ignore it because they think they are in power.  
Besides, deals are not how this should work. It's not tit for tat, it's either good or it isn't. Segwit doesn't have anything to do with a hardfork or base blocksize increase, it's either good or it isn't.

I don't for my Belgian card, but there are some banks here that do the same. Even if they charged me some costs it would likely trump the €50 I payed for ledger wallet.  
I'm not going to argue whether bitcoin is slightly ahead or behind, but I think we can agree the difference is fairly marginal.
International (non-euro) wire transfers is another thing, definitely in case of remittance, but given the slowness of the current system I think 10 minute confirmed transactions isn't a major upside, surely not if there's always an option to get confirmation in 10 minutes (by paying a larger fee).
Don't get me wrong, instant transactions are better than delayed transactions and cheaper is always better obviously, but to put speed and marginal fees above anything else is imo not what users want. At least not me.

Litecoin as enough apps and software, BCH being easier to convert isn't really that valuable. I also don't see how or why it would make the BCH community larger.
Litecoin is the oldest altcoin out there, it's the 4th largest cryptocurrency, so I wouldn't say it never picked up. Given that it follows Bitcoin it has and will have more improvements than BCH (atomic swaps with Bitcoin, schnorr, etc.)
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:07:10
Damn, forgot about that one already.
I was thinking more in terms of the latest proposal, which uses previous blocksizes instead of miner voting. However, I can't find any similar proposals, so it must have been tossed around on reddit or something. So you're right in not adding it ;)

Besides, getting people who can't figure it out on their own into bitcoin safely requires a lot of time and effort. To do this in advance you need to start way ahead of time.

And in a sense it is the same, but instead of trusting your own validations you're trusting other peoples validations (and the connection you have with those people, etc.). But yeah, I should've said pruned nodes might be a better solution for the same problem or something.

It's clearly not a "bitcoin article", but an ethereum article.
That said, I wouldn't mind it being here, but you can't blame the mods for removing it. Every single article about any of the 500+ alt-coins out there is going to mention bitcoin, so that's no excuse to post it.
The community doesn't solve problems (at least the reddit community doesn't), it's the developers that do. There's no-one who wrote a single line of code in bitcoin that's alive today and doesn't know what ethereum is or does.

No it's not. I can read, you can read, let's not pretend it is. My guess is that you're quoting the guardian. 




First off, it actually still is. (but I get the sentiment, if this where the case)  
Second off, the EU doesn't say to whom or at what price. Only that it needs to be transparent.


Again. No. It's not their framework, it's the framework of the Greek government. All the EU is asking is for the framework to be according to OECD principles to guarantee transparency, a fair price and whatnot. Those are international guidelines and exist for years.

That's not really an issue now, and again, we don't know how bitcoin will scale and how nodes will scale.
There's far more important and urgent things to scale than the mempool size. Which will likely scale together with those other solutions.

Having a severe limit on number of transactions is the problem. Removing or redefining the cap is a solution.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:03:51
Yes it could.
You can run a pruned node, so it kind of already exists.
If you don't have the full blockchain, you're trusting someone else. This trust can be mitigated, but it does open up things for theoretical attacks.
As long as we don't bloat the blockchain there's little need for this anytime soon. 40Gb shouldn't be that much of a concern for modern day computers, and should be easy to keep up with increasing cheaper $/Gb drives.
There might be a time where we need this, but it's far from due.

Greece had a choice. They could default or they could be the EU's puppet. They still have that choice actually.

also: We don't need to be a node to run a wallet, therefor there won't be a decline in nodes? What kinda logic is that?


No we don't, but running a full node now uses up 200-300 GB a month. Which means it'll be 1600 - 2400GB, which is beyond most fair use policies which is in place in a lot of first world countries.


See first response.


No it wasn't. I'm talking about the fork from 3 weeks ago.


I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm pretty sure it's not a response to what I was saying.
Propagation time has 2 factors that benefit large pools: They can mine on their own block faster, because the rest of the network hasn't received the block yet. Larger propagation time also leads to more orphaned blocks. Because a big mining pool has a bigger amount of hashpower working on their part of the fork it is more likely their fork won't get orphaned.


I've said that in my first response. Nobody is saying we should never ever increase the blocksize. The lightning network would give us time to solve the scalability issues, not the other way around.

@_date: 2015-07-13 13:50:15
It's like a multisig. Greece owns 2 of the 3 keys, Europe 1 key.
If they want to make a transaction they need their signature and Europe's.  
If they really want they can use their 2nd back-up key to make the transaction, but that's going to piss off Europe and it's likely Europe doesn't want to do business with them anymore.

You can do the same attack even if the mempool is dropped after X time. A smart attacker makes their fees small enough so the majority of their transactions don't go through, and they can send it again when they drop.

There's two issues here.
The address being sent from still hasn't received an incoming transaction, so you'll have to wait before that transaction settles first.
Second issue is that both transactions have a very small fee.
It doesn't look like a scam, they just have their transaction fees set very low. Which wouldn't be a problem if blocks weren't full, but with current delays you could be waiting a few more days.
It is out of their hands now, but it is their fault for not including a big enough fee on their transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:57:25
There would be advantages to it if bitcoin becomes so huge anything but a datacenter can handle storing, validating and relaying blocks.
Look at it as storj for the blockchain. Before lightning and side-chains a lot of people assumed there would a point in time where not every node should be validating every single transaction.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:27:31
As insecure as 0-conformation transactions are right now, it would make it much worse if you're going to drop transaction from the mempool.
It would make attacks like this have a much worse outcome. Getting your transaction delayed is bad but getting it rejected is worse.
You can always resend your transaction if it's not included in a block yet, no need to wait.

But this is all in a Peter Todd-like world. There's many turns bitcoin can take. If tomorrow block propagation time gets fixed, this might never be an issue for years to come, and god knows how bitcoin looks by then.

We're not past that point, that's the whole point I'm trying to make. If you where right, then indeed, there was no turning back because Greece handed over their assets. But at ANY point in the future (until everything is sold and re-allocated) Greece can give a "fuck off" to Europe. If 50% of assets are sold, and Greece says: you know, we think the airport shouldn't be privatized, we're not going to sell that one. Then that's that, there's nothing the EU can do to privatize the airport.
Yes they don't have the balls to do this, but that doesn't mean they are *forced* or that they don't have *control*.

It is indeed because the low transaction fee.
While you could try and send the transaction again with a larger fee to F2Pool (they're the only one running replace by fee), that's kinda complicated. Depending on what the transaction is for, waiting might be the best option.

It doesn't need to be on, it's broadcasted to the network, that's all you can do.
There's 1 mining pool that accepts transactions from the same inputs but with a larger fee, but there aren't really tools to construct such a transaction so you have to do it manually, and make sure they get it, because most nodes reject such a transaction. It's pretty complicated.
It depends on the size of the transaction, but yesterday I've sent a transaction with 0.0001 fee and it got in the first block.

"We can’t sit around waiting for a financial crises or a massive inflation in fiat currencies to help Bitcoin take off. The mark of a superior technology is that it never relies on failures of its predecessor. "
I disagree with this.  
Why is a technology superior? Because it has features the old technology doesn't have.  
If everything is working fine, the fiat system is as useful, if not more than bitcoin.
Bitcoin is better as a technology because we can't trust the people in control of the old technology. Bitcoin is better because the old technology is failing.  
Therefor I'd say we have to wait until shit goes down, because otherwise no one cares, no matter how often you explain the (theoretical) advantages over the current system.

Indeed. Point out the point where the EU says to whom and at what price they should sell?
There's a difference between a veto and absolute power. Although a veto is pretty powerful if abused.


It's according to OECD standards. Which gives Greece the opportunity to choose how they're going to sell it, but once they chose an option, it's basically according to those rules.


I'm not going to deny Greece hasn't got many room to manoeuvre, but the words people use are just misleading.
Being forced to do something means you have no choice. Greece has a choice.
Greece could choose to sell 50b+ in assets in a standardized way and reallocate those funds in a way the EU wants, or they could choose not to ask for help and default.

There's work being done in all those fields. Yet, solutions aren't here. If it where easy it would've already been done.
If you send bitcoins without a fee to your own wallet, you give up custodial control in a timed manner. Every time you send a normal transaction you give up control until the transaction is included in a block. These are known facts, it's how the system works. Having funds locked up in LN which you can't afford is the same as having a 0-fee transaction not go through that you can't afford.

These things can be addressed by changing to a quantum-safe algorithm, but that would require everyone to change software and move their funds.
As the guy in your link says: basically everything on the internet is broken with quantum computing, but what's broken can be fixed, and out of all the things that would break, fixing Bitcoin will be the easy thing.

You aren't being punished, it's not an issue.
Again, there are more urgent problems, problems to which the solutions are likely to deal with mempool sizes too.
0-conf. transactions is something people are working on. I don't know which ideas are in the air exactly, but they may need to not get rejected. Also: Why should other people be punished because you want a solution to a hypothetical problem?
Dropping transactions after a certain time requires relatively little programming work, you can fairly safely wait until this actually starts becoming a problem.

At current node-count it's extremely unlikely the UASF would go through. It's early on, I'd assume all segwit signalling hashpower would support the UASF if it gains enough traction.
I'm not saying a hashrate attack isn't possible or more likely, I'm just saying it's out of the scope of a BIP. What happens when a minority chain is attacked is something that's decided by the community, not by the people creating the minority chain.

4. Litecoin implements segwit which doesn't gain miner traction on bitcoin: altcoins are great as testbeds, it's like our little brother!

The first example is true both ways, and the last example is in benefit of a UASF conversion. If it's a 50/50, why would you choose the side that might end up being wiped out?
That said, if it actually forks you shouldn't be accepting bitcoin at that given time, it's just too risky whatever path you take. If you really want to, you can only accept coins that confirm on both chains, but that probably won't be worth the bother to implement.

Contentious forks are extremely dangerous indeed, I'm not disputing that.  
However, in your example of one nation taking over, there's hardly any dispute on which is the valid fork. Therefor there's no need for wars.
On the other hand, if said nation forces it's citizens to only accept the new fork, things might indeed get fishy. There are solutions to that as well, but again, wars have been fought over less.

Ultimately it's miner support, not economic support that dictates a chain split. The chain doesn't split if there's miner support but no economic majority and it does split with no miner support and majority of the economy.

Try to do a micro transaction every second which instantly confirms on chain ... There's a lot of things lightning enables, loading off transactions is only a Scaling solution long term, because you need to create and close channels anyway and the usecases early on will likely be new things that people didn't do on - chain.

Most of the time the "make your own version" is a response to "why don't they just do X?"  
Which kinda implies that it's easy and fast to do, and quit honestly I think it's disrespectful to the people putting in the effort to actually do something.
People don't seem to realize writing code is time consuming and almost no one is getting payed to write bitcoin code. So to make things as efficient as possible people tend to code things that have consensus or that will very likely reach consensus.  
Most of the developers are putting in time, effort and skill into something that benefits us all for free. Yet, somehow people seem to think they "owe" us to develop every wicked thing that's being tossed around on reddit.

If you are slow, you don't relay and you're not a full node. So how is that going to not decrease the number of full nodes? I don't get it.


Well, there need to be a decent amount of nodes that store the full blockchain, but aside from that: you still have a massive amount of data-traffic, that's the issue, not so much full block-chain storage.


  
We do if we don't want a decline in full nodes.


No they don't.


I don't live in the US, I got no clue what a dingo and SEC are.
Remember you said this about centralized solutions. I'll refer to this later on.


Clearly I've stated "Full node", so you DO need to relay.
And please, tell me how you can do it "differently" on tor.


The problem was SPV mining, not the "bug". I think I make a general point to say that miners not validating blocks is a bad thing. If you don't agree on that, feel free to comment. 


Orphan rate is +/- 1%, which will increase with bigger blocks. At 20mb blocks it was 5%, don't know the calculations for 8. Which is a pretty big deal if you're working on a tight margin.


The problem with that is that the connection is not part of bitcoin. If miners don't want to send the direct connection block to the new mining pool on the block, they don't. This works centralized mining in hand.
You're solving it with a centralized solution, that shouldn't be the way to go.


Remember? Do we want centralized solutions or not?
"Can you give me ETA for that?" No, but clearly you can: "Lightning will not be ready in time"
Can you give an ETA of transaction-volume being so high people are forced to use centralized solutions?

Not at all. It's more like a coinbase or bitcoin gambling site. You deposit money to them, they hold it and you trust them to one day give you money back when you ask for it. Just a company like any other.
Sidechains give you a guarantee you can redeem your coins back, no trust involved. Sidechains are a product of the superior design of bitcoin, which can enable things like sidechains. Since in traditional finance the base system is flawed to begin with, there can never be a sidechain analogy imo, because sidechains require a safe and secure base layer.

There are so many discussions on this on so many places, I'd recommend you look at the bitcoin developer mailinglist, because they have the most expertise.
There's a lot of arguments, but I'll say the ones that are already  visible now (or easily imaginable) and that come up on top of my head.
Further and increased decline of full nodes. It's been dropping for a long time, despite an increased userbase. Making blocks 8 times as big isn't going to help.
People with capped datavolume or people in parts of the world with slow connections are unable to participate.
Unable to run a full node via tor. Which isn't important now, but it might become important in the future if large governments strike down on bitcoin.
Increased incentive for miners not to validate blocks. We've seen the consequence of this already.
Larger propagation time which benefits larger mining pools. This is already the case, but it increases further.
You're kicking the can down the road, you don't really solve the scalebility issues.
Also take notice that non of the 'anti-blocksize increase'-people are against raising the blocksize by default. They all have a notion of "if X is fixed, I'll support an increase in blocksize".
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:22:56
segwit has been running on sidechains alpha as long as it exists, the general principle has been tested for a long time.   
RBF has nothing to do with this, all your concerns about RBF have been addressed multiple times in many many ways. If you have a breakthrough attack-vector that disrupts the status quo please tell us about it in a relevant post.   
I also want to point out segwit is going to happen, and that fact doesn't have any contention. The codebase is going to change because segwit is a great solution to multiple problems (also no contention). The contention is about whether segwit should also incorporate an indirect blocksize increase and whether it should happen before or after a blocksize increase by hardfork. That's all what's being discussed, don't go guessing what "anti-classic proponents" think and elaborate on that, just stick with facts.
Given the nature of bitcoin it is very costly to do scaling by throwing more resources at it. Amazon can spin up a few machines easily when demand increases. If bitcoin wants to do resource scaling the entire network needs to up their resources. Calling these two things equivalent is just nonsense imo.
Honestly, I might have been far more swayed by your response if it had not had such a biased appeal to emotion.

Bitcoin is governed by consensus, like any other open source project. We move together, we don't move or we split up. Those are the options.
The difference in bitcoin is that it's much harder to fork the project and introduce different rules. Which leads to the current impasse.
Harder doesn't mean impossible though. If we compare to "normal" open source behavior it would sense if the minority forks off from the majority, but in bitcoin the minority isn't willing to do this. So the majority has a few things it can do, like the UASF or a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:23:50
I see your point.
The forking off is only happening if there's a chain fork, but yeah that should probably be mentioned.
Technically there are no countermeasures, we're forking off if the majority hashing power doesn't follow. I agree that, given the BIP1 rule, that should be stated in the compatibility section.
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:12:51
I certainly understand why you'd want it, but for things as broad as 'scaling' it's a risk imo. You wouldn't want people to miss information that might cause them to lose money (ending up on a different fork). For example: just because people are tired of the millionth post about why we need segwit, doesn't mean they're not interested in the UASF.

It's really ill-advised to give your bitcoins to a trading place, but if they already have your funds, you don't even need to make bitcoin transactions, because technically they where never your bitcoins.
If you pay a high enough transaction fee you'll have no problem with transaction delays, even if you didn't, there's steps you could take to up the fee.
You can push a button and send the bitcoins if you actually had them. All you have now is a promise of a company they will give you bitcoin/dollars if you ask for it, that's not an issue of bitcoin, that's an issue of exchanges. So yeah: if you decide to keep your holdings: keep them yourself, don't trust anyone to hold them for you.

There are people on both sides. You can be pro BU but still want segwit to happen via UASF, you can be pro Core+segwit but still want no risk of splitting the chain.
The miners who don't want this to happen can just continue to mine on their software. If it's more than 50% who does this we get 2 chains and the economy will decide what's the most valuable. Note the 'miner-chain' is at risk of being eliminated by the 'user-chain' if the latter becomes longer.
For the users who haven't updated to a UASF client, and the chains splits, they will end up on the 'miner-chain'. That's why some people only want to do a UASF with 50%+ support of the miners.
As for the future: no one knows, as so often in Bitcoin, we're on unmarked territory.

Since questions don't seem to work I'll rephrase.
If a majority of mining power forks bitcoin, the consensus doesn't change. Invalid blocks are still invalid blocks from a users perspective. Therefor it's not a contentious fork. Look at today, the network didn't crash either because miners where mining the wrong fork.

The idea of bitcoin is that anyone can verify that their transaction is valid. That you don't need to trust a 3rd party.   
Satoshi wrote the whitepaper more than 7 years ago, while knowing nothing of what would become bitcoin or what is possible today. All respect to them, but I think people put way to much weight on their words.

Ok, I get the sentiment, but it's just a language thing. Ultimately no one can claim anything, it's always: until proven differently.

"I have seen nor thought of any incentive to do that, it is probabilistic very likely he didn't know UASF was going to be a thing, I have seen nor thought of any scenarios where the results are really disastrous from my point of view, as far as my knowledge and vision goes the worst that can happen is we end up with 2 chains, which isn't a good result in my point of view, but it's not a disaster from my point of view either.

I've responded to this in my other response, but I'll c/p here:
The problem with that is that the connection is not part of bitcoin. If miners don't want to send the direct connection block to the new mining pool on the block, they don't. This works centralized mining in hand. You're solving it with a centralized solution, that shouldn't be the way to go.

I don't follow the classic development so closely, and I'm not a developer anyway, so maybe someone more knowledgeable can chime in, but it seems to me they just did the very basics and are building on top of that.    
Core generally makes things so that they don't need to be extended or touched in a long while, as phantomcircuit said "coming up with the best way to do it".    
Peter Todd said in the meeting as well, that he could write the versionbit logic in 2 lines of code. It's all the edge-cases and functionalities that make it harder. For example adding an expiration date turns out to be hard for classic too    
What if a certain threshold is reached and then it drops again (I think that was the issue with the Peter Todd way, not sure though)   
There's likely many edge cases that I can't come up with, but those things come to mind.

That's what I meant with throughput as well.
A blocksize increase is no solution, it's a way to increase throughput. We technically can't do 100Mb blocks, but if we could we'd still be nowhere near what VISA does. Bitcoin is programmable money, you can do anything with it, so we'll need to scale above and beyond what VISA does.

Back when Satoshi was around, he was there to give his opinion. Now he's gone for 6 years, the world has changed, Bitcoin has changed, new things are thought of and old things didn't work like they meant to. It would be silly to attach too much value on something Satoshi ones said when he isn't around to say whether or not he still thinks this way in todays world.
Not sure where you read about Luke-jr, seems like you might have misunderstood some things, but even if: he's just one person with his own opinion. Devs nor miners decide the future of Bitcoin. If we all wanted Bitcoin Unlimited we would've all changed. Now some users want to do a UASF to force segwit, which isn't supported by any major Bitcoin developer, but if we all want it, it'll happen. We choose to run the software we want, if we don't want changes we don't upgrade, if we want changes we change to a client that satisfies our needs.
Devs have neither the power to lift or keep the blocksize limit and thus none of them can make such a promise.
@_date: 2017-04-22 12:36:54
Then they can run the Lightning Network, don't have to deal with malleability issues, can easily introduce new scripts via script versioning which makes schnorr, MAST easy to introduce.
They scale more efficient because the sighash scaling and disincentivizing UTXO growth.
The blocksize increase is just because it's possible, which is great for bitcoin and indeed doesn't matter for litecoin, but it's just a side-effect to an already great improvement.

It's "_new_ created value". Not "creating value". It's about new coins being mined.
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:45:08
I'll try and sketch some scenarios:
Say miner support for BIP148 is at segwit level, so 30%, and we end up with 2 chains.
If 80%-90% of exchanges say: we will check for your transactions on chain X, that creates a huge incentive for the other exchanges to do the same, because users won't be interested in coins that they can't redeem on 80-90% of exchanges.
If ~50% of exchanges pick opposite sides, that's the point where it gets messy. Given no exchange will want to end up on the wrong side if it does converge, we might see things like: we only accept transactions confirmed on both chains.  
If this mess continues the BIP148-chain might choose to introduce a change that makes transactions valid on the BIP148-chain, but invalid on the other, so that we end up with 2 different currencies.
The caveat is: if at any point in time the BIP148-chain overtakes the non-BIP148-chain, the non-BIP148-chain will be orphaned away. Given this risk I think it's likely a 50% support will converge towards BIP148.
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:41:35
Delayed blocktimes is a problem indeed, but that'll just take some time to get fixed. 
Hashrate attacks is something we can have right now. We'll see if it happens, just like we do now.
Orphan rates only go up if the mining split is close to 50/50.
PoW change has nothing to do with this proposal.

There are many places in the world where you can't realistically run a full node right now, and that's a bad thing, however I don't think it's an argument for broadening that scope, let alone pushing it towards companies and mining operations.   
Companies don't tend to put resources into "the greater good". Look how few bitcoin companies are running their own nodes or employ developers to work on the network right now. If nodes are only miners and companies trying to earn money by spying on everyone or censor transactions, that's a very bad place to be.

If you don't care about security you can just take a piece of paper, write your password on it, and put it in your wallet. It's the same security as your paper notes and credit-cards.  
Bitcoin allows you to do better security though. You can use hardware wallets with simple passwords, online multi-sig, paper wallets for long term storage, etc.   
Treat it like cash. You have a small amount with less security at hand, and have the rest stored in a more secure environment.

Do you develop for open source software? To me there seems to be value in not having to review things over and over again because bugfixes and additions. Plus the fact there's money involved. Doing things wrong might result in people losing significant amounts of money.   
To me, again not as a developer, it makes more sense to start from a good design instead of something that works and build a bunch of fixes and patches on top of that. Something that comes to mind is the mempool limiting. XT had mempool limiting way before core (i think they just evicted random transactions) . It had some known attack vector which they didn't fix until someone threatened to do the attack. Now core has mempool limiting too, it being a way better system, which can possibly be used for fee estimation, has a more uniform mempool which might be good for IBLT (random guess here), etc.

Bitcoin isn't, and never was, a "safe" investment. It's a brand new technology challenging one of the most profitable industries in the world. We're on uncharted territory every step of the way.
Just like any other risky investment the advice is always: don't invest more than you can afford to lose. I can't give you my opinion on whether it's a good investment or not, because it's different for everybody. Everyone's financial situation is differently, everyone risk-tolerance is different, etc. I feel comfortable with my bitcoin holdings, and I'm seeing the future bright, but if you're losing sleep over it, it might be better for you to take some profit off the table.

The 3.7 (3.8 I think it was actually) number is correct as the theoretical maximum. In practice it's about 2x given the current transaction types on the network.
So we double the throughput, which is a good way of checking how the network reacts to a throughput increase.
There is no "solution" for the throughput problem, just like there's no solution to the bandwidth problem on the internet. We can only try to make it better.

~~Neither, the signature data is decoupled from the transaction data.~~ The old nodes only see the transaction data, that way it can be a softfork because the limit is still on place, even though there's effectively more data.

Downvoting because of the topic title... It's bad etiquette to talk about votes, to state opinions as facts and to make personal attacks imo.
Anyway, when it comes to time-frames you might be right, but you can argue about this. Should you count "the web" as the start or "the internet" as the start and let "the web" be the "killer app"? I think Andreas always refers to the internet being the start, since he talks about E-mail. So it's not 12 years, but 40 years, so we got quite a run still.
To your main point: it might be adopted on the back end first, but your view comes from a very western viewpoint. In countries where a stable currency isn't a given, where there are currency controls, where governments seize money willy nilly, there's a need for something like bitcoin. People in the western world have no idea of economics, you're totally right, but talk to a random guy on the streets of Zimbabwe. He'll tell you all about failing currencies and can probably give you the exchange rate out of his head of USD vs Euro vs Rand vs Pula to a good accuracy.

It's a fairly vague word, but it generally means something that is never actually developed, or has stopped being developed and never officially cancelled. Besides, it's implemented, just not activated. (and waiting for additional optimizations)
Lightning is dependent on segwit, so it's hard to give a time-based roadmap. Also: there's like 6 implementations or something, if one of them gives their roadmap, it doesn't mean anything for the other implementations. Lightning will work once the first implementation works.
The r/btc people have an extremely bad reputation, you can't really blame anyone for advising to ignore them.  
The Core team has chosen to do segwit first. It's totally fine to disagree with that, it would be crazy to assume everyone agrees all the time. For example sidechains is something that I still need to be convinced about, if the Core team chooses to implement sidechains and can't convince me I'll keep disagreeing. However I'll never call it "vaporware", I'll never call developers names or assume bad faith, I'll never try to insert the discussion into every random topic over and over again. I'll try to understand and discuss the fundamental differences in our opinions and either accept those differences or leave/support alternatives.

It does give you control over the network. It depends what the rest of the world does when it happens whether it destroys its value.

It's also not correct to assume low fees, that's the entire point I'm trying to make. Having a channel open from main to side effectively means you're storing the coins on the sidechain. Using the mainchain will be impractical (otherwise why would anyone use sidechains) so you're forcing people to use it, unlike circle, where people want to use it. A 1-1 peg means the token is the same, it doesn't mean the value is the same. If you'd take the extreme case where I am the only one who can mine sidechain blocks, would you consider the value the same?
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:06:41
As this might be a complicated subject, I'll give you another point of view.
When nodes see a transaction they verify a few things. Firstly whether the signature is right, to see if the person trying to spend this money is actually the owner of that address. Secondly it verifies whether there's actually money to spend by that address, by checking the history on the blockchain to see if it originates from legitimately mined coins, and also by checking whether those funds aren't already been sent to someone else earlier.   
In practice, since it's quite intensive to seek this information for every transaction, nodes keep a list in memory of all addresses that aren't spent yet, the so called unspent transaction outputs.

Not a "big blocker", but sidechains have always been questionable when it comes to being a scaling solution. I don't see how you don't end up with a 2-tier bitcoin price, as mainchain bitcoins have a much better security model. He says you just start with low amounts in the beginning, like $10's worth of bitcoin, but are those $10 in the beginning sidechain really worth $10? Bitcoin derives its value from security. If we know it can be realistically attacked, its value would drop. That's what you do in a sidechain, you weaken the security, but somehow expect the same value. 
Doom vision would be lots of attackable sidechains, while nearly everyone is priced out on the mainchain.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:04:16
You still need to set up a node for every sidechain, and maintain that node, and ideally follow up with development on the sidechain, etc. All the same things as namecoin mining afaik.

I'd argue 1 bitcoin on circle is worth less. There's some convenience which takes its place, which is why people use it, but if you'd ask people here to store 1 bitcoin on circle most people would want a decent premium for the additional risk. That comparison holds true when you talk about specific use cases, but having to lower the security model to use bitcoin for anything at all raises questions IMO.
The mmo example he gives is a good example to scale, but it falls apart when you talk about scaling securely, as a small server in an mmo is as secure as the big ones, while this isn't true for bitcoin.

Day trading is a bad idea indeed.
It largely depends on what you intend to use bitcoin for. A lot of people use it as an investment to hedge against their local currency and overall economy. There's people who use it to bypass local regulations, who might only hold enough for the transaction.
I personally don't see much of a use case in only holding transaction size amount of bitcoin for purchasing normal things you can buy with other means as well. But you use your coins in whatever way you want of course.

I've only seen the intro, but is the mining centralization on namecoin addressed in any way?
The obvious argument against merged mining is that we already have it, and it failed (I see a single mining pool having 50%+ hashrate as a failure).
Adding merged mining is a fixed cost. While it might be profitable for a large miner to make that fixed cost, it might not be for a small miner, that brings centralization pressure on the main chain.
Again, I've only seen the intro, but I'm not inclined the watch further if the elephant in the room is never addressed.

I'm not a lawyer but logically the burden would fall on the sender(s). If I send you money and my bank goes bankrupt and doesn't send it through, I still owe you money.
Which in this case is a good outcome, since the sender should still have the money if the transaction/contract never happened.
Of course when you get really complicated smart contracts, like in Ethereum, it's a legal nightmare as it's hard to find out who's sending, who should have what, etc.
I think most people would abandon bitcoin though, if it gets 51% attacked.

That works fine in todays environment, but will it also work if bitcoin is  very widely spread? If governments tried to censor the internet in the very early days, surely they could've made some drastic changes to prevent it, but now we're relying on 2nd layer work-arounds.
If certain blacklists are made LN doesn't help with that. If the government says you can't process transactions coming from 1ChildMolester9df4ds5fgqsd5f1jqfxcvpa, no channel can be created with that address either. Then the question arises whether the whole world, which in a few years might mean entire banking infrastructures, point-of-sale hardware, hardware wallets, smart devices, ... will change PoW because a single child-molester can't send transactions. If that doesn't happen they'll boil the frog.

You need some kind of 'oracle' to hand you the information about the weather. This can be done by outsourcing it to a trusted party/parties. It can also be done via a decentralized prediction market which a couple of companies are working on, like  Truthcoin/hivemind on a bitcoin sidechain, augur &amp; gnosis on ethereum. Once they are live, you can take the information directly from the blockchain and integrate it into your contracts. For more information on how it's done, google/youtube for those companies as it's pretty complex when you go into details.
Private blockchains aren't as useful as public blockchains, but people will use them nonetheless. Like banks between each other, etc.
I wouldn't say every blockchain has "bitcoinish" things, but in the end there is no value if nobody wants it, which goes for everything, not only crypto-currencies.
6) yes indeed, it's possible. I can't find the video of Andreas Antonopoulos, so I'm going to paraphrase here: you have to understand the new way of thinking about currencies just in the same way the internet made us think in new ways about information. It used to be the case that the ability to spread information was solely dependent on the size of your printing press. The ability to spread information was not dependent on the writer, it was dependent on the publisher. Then the internet came, and now suddenly a blogger in Egypt had as much publishing power as CNN. People have so much information to choose from it no longer matters who publishes it, but it matters which reputation they have, the location they're at, the media they present, etc. When they're riots in Egypt, the Egyptian blogger tweeting live on the ground now suddenly becomes a better source of information than CNN.  
With currencies we still think in the old way. By publisher. Which country publishes the currency. Now, in the age of crypto-currencies anyone can make a currency. You have the same ability of creating a currency than the USA. Now we have to look for new ways of detecting quality money. Like which purpose do they fulfill, how much development is behind it, how decentralized is it, what the issuance rate is, etc.
Namecoin does registration things, don't know the details personally, but I think it's basically like bitcoin but with larger fields of data. Search for namecoin if you want more details. They issue new coins for every block. The incentive for miners in (I think) every blockchain is either new created money (like the 12.5฿ in bitcoin) or it's transaction fees when the currency has other ways of distributing the currency.

Although I think industrialized mining will continue to be very large there's room for consumer and smaller miners. There's also this idea that mining chips will become very cheap and we'll have them in heaters, but I'm pretty skeptical towards that.
What convinced me is the idea of using excess energy. During summer there's often too much energy because all the solarpanels and windmills. Last year it was all over the news in my country (Belgium) that we had to pay other countries to take electricity from us at certain times. Consumers with solarpanels don't get payed if they deliver more electricity than they consume too. My uncle actually bought some electric stoves, even though his house is heated by natural gas, because he had produced too much energy. Since there's more and more renewable energy, excess energy will become a larger problem.

To add onto Yoghurt: Schnorr signatures, which can be introduces via a softfork, reduce all transaction in size slightly and multisig transactions by a lot. It also provides faster signature verification and increases privacy.

The blockreward or 'bounty' is currently 12.5, it halved 2 months ago.
1) Let the people who want the service pay for it. Every blockchain has some kind of economic incentive in it. Blockchains are pretty impractical as a database, you should have a reason to specifically use a blockchain.
2) yes, see above
3) yes, because there's no competition, it's basically just a way too complicated database.
4) You need incentives. Not sure what the question is though.
5) You can use any implementation and basically just change the genisis block. In bitcoin you can start up bitcoin in regtest mode and you have a private blockchain. There's also a website that does the work for you and sends you the software for the new altcoin you created for a price (
6) Supply and demand, like any other currency.

On chain capacity has not been blocked. We did segwit which increases capacity, schnorr is in the works which increases capacity.
There's been tons of research surrounding hard forks, a bunch of general proposals to create consensus about what's needed in a hard fork. B2X chooses to ignore all of that and just goes with the 2 year old bip102.
There's hardly anyone who thinks we'll never need a hard fork, that doesn't mean we need to fork with anything anyone proposes just for the sake of it. If you want consensus, better start working from something that already has widespread agreement, like spoonnet.

I think the relation between technology and quality posts is definitely going down. There's so much more academic research, more ideas, more development, etc. than in 2013, yet the posts don't reflect that. 
In 2013 we didn't have segwit, schnorr would've been a hardfork, lightning network wasn't invented. (not like there's many posts about the technical aspects of schnorr anyway), so it's obvious there was no talk about those, but people talked about checklocktime, openbazaar/darkmarket, lighthouse, decentralized exchanges, sidechains, etc.

Maybe you should consider leaving out stuff that doesn't work.
If you're selling doors that open by retina scan, you don't put a key-lock in it that opens with any key because that's not the security you're focusing on. You either get a working lock or you don't do a lock at all. Maybe in worst case you provide a warning to the customer they shouldn't pay any attention to the lock, since it's really insecure.
If the stickers are useless, don't do stickers. If the checksum is useless, don't provide checksums.

You are not using bitcoin. You are using coinbase.  
If you care about no restrictions, you use bitcoin.  
What's the use of replacing one bank with another? Just because they don't have extreme regulation yet, or they haven't gone out of business yet doesn't mean they're not a bank.  
You give them money, they say they'll give it back to you when you ask for it. That's a bank.

There's things I don't agree with in your text, but I'll just ask some additional questions to get an idea of the fundamental differences in mindset.
- If there was a way to accurately measure users opinion, which percentage of userbase do you think is the minimum support needed to initiate a hardfork?
- same premise, which percentage of companies do you think should support it before initiating?
- same premise plus the premise you made yourself in that hashing power will follow their own political believes and not economic value, how much % of userbase and companies would you need to NOT support a miner activated hardfork before hardforking away from the miners (different algorithm) / or wait for the next difficulty?
- When should the next hardfork be? As there isn't any mechanism to allow future blocksize increases, nor a gradual increase.

I was talking about the federated peg like in elements Alpha. (
PoS has problems which aren't addressed yet, last thing I've read is just solutions that create other problems, to which the solution creates problems again, and so on.
 The federated pegs, PoS, high costs of nodes, etc. Are no problem if everyone plays along nicely. There are PoS coins that are alive and well, sidechains alpha is alive and kicking... That doesn't mean those are preferable solutions though, because we know they have issues and it's only a matter of time before they get exploited, and then we can't go back.

I think the car is a bad example as well, but I just went with it.
The question is: do car manufacturers follow sales or their own ideals? I think we've seen with bcash that hashpower follows economic value.
There's indeed big players in favor, but also big players against it. I don't think there's anyone at this point who thinks this won't end up in a split. Which is fine, you can split off the bitcoin network at any time you want, but if you want the entire network to follow you, you're going to have to do better than: fuck your concerns, research, ideas and technical requests, we're doing this.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:36:19
You can do to your car what you want, but if it doesn't fit the road system everyone else is using you'll be forced to using your own road system, with all economic consequences following it.
Right now we have a few car manufactures who came together in a meeting and came out saying: we're going to make bigger engines.   
 Engineers are saying: if you really want bigger engines you'll need a bigger car body, you better redesign it so it has better aerodynamics, might as well add another cylinder, fix a few valves, restructure the engine block so it's more efficient, make the weight and size of the total car increase slowly to lower the impact on the roadsystem and let's give a longer notice so people have enough time to update their garages and roads.  
Users are saying: yeah, those engineers make a lot of sense, let's not do bigger engines right now. Our cars are becoming faster by the fuel efficiency improvements anyway, with other improvements on fuel in the pipeline. Besides, I don't want the CEO to design my car engine, I want the engineers to do that.  
The car manufacturers involved are saying: fuck all of you, we did a meeting saying we're going to have bigger engines, so we're doing bigger engines.

It can be used for that purpose, but it would kinda be a waste. Your private key is 51 characters long or 12/24 English words. You can store it on anything that's durable.
The most important part is that you generate your keys offline on a safe computer. It would also be wise to keep a back-up in another location.

Yeah, that should work.  
I guess I said it wrong. It's likely somebody will make one sooner or later, but in terms of usability it's not really great, so their use (outside of being a node) is very limited.  It's a bit like raspberry pi nodes, it's for people who really want to contribute and mobile pruned wallets give them an extra opportunity.

Outside from the fact all users where technically knowledgeable people and had a deeper understanding of it, does it really matter what other interest groups supported?
No usergroup of any technology ever went: yeah, it's fine, we don't need any improvements. There's no technology where there's no entrepreneur who thinks: if this technology improves in X way I could do Y with it.
The major difference with most technologies and bitcoin is that the restrictions at the time aren't fundamental, but politically motivated. When the reason of existence for a technology is politically motivated, these things have to be factored in.  
Just like you can probably scale TOR way better if you do some privacy trade-offs.

Remembering 8 numbers and a word, which you never use is harder than you think.
Having all pub keys in a database isn't that much of a requirement.
What's really the safety factor here is the amount of work to uncover the keys, making it unprofitable to randomly search combinations. Which imo is a nice idea.
In general though, I think we need to avoid the idea of self chosen brainwallets, because when given the option people often choose the easy to remember stuff. With the same effort you can make a secure encrypted paper wallet.

The problem would've resolved itself, albeit a bit slower.  
You know what's a human network? Banks. Banks can't run without humans, they are essential. Banks can run without software, but their software can't run without humans.
You know why we need bitcoin? Because we can't trust humans. We can't trust banks, we can't trust governments and we can't trust every other human because we are inherently selfish. 
Bitcoin exists because all the systems in which humans interact are failing. That's why it is important to mark an increased involvement from humans as dangerous. That's why developers search for the best solutions and not just any solution that works and go "bwaah, it'll work out, people don't need to validate everything". Or at least most developers do.

If Mr. A used a different address every time he received a transaction,  and transfers 1 bitcoin entirely after it, yes, the fee might be a consideration (couple of $). If he receives it in the same address it's just the same.

While I hate tribalism I do think it's fair game to talk about BU specifically on this topic. I think Bitcoin Knots offers the most freedom in terms of options and thus less friction, however non of those options will lead to you getting out of consensus.
Theoretically miners should be a lot more responsible than they are right now. For example, it would make great sense if they'd fund some developer(s) working on things that matter to them. So I'm not so sure about the due diligence.
The blocksize issue is so blown up it makes it seem less of an issue, but I think most people would agree it's stupid to add easy ways for other political views to be changed, like the OP_return size, timelocks, P2SH, RBF, etc. in a way that could take you out of consensus.

Still though, I see very little use for it. Bitcoin is not what you can call a stable currency, nor is it really convenient, most places work best with simple cash, etc.
But if you really want to do bitcoin things in 3rd world countries I think coinapult is a good way to go, because the SMS option. I don't know what kinda fees there are though, and how they compare with things like M-pesa.

In 2014 bitcoin was the worst performing currency in the world.
The only reason coinbase etc. don't have capital controls yet is because they fly under the radar. Once it becomes big it'll get regulated like any other bank.
Why would they want to send small amounts of money internationally anyway?
I mean, yes: if you have a country with a currency like the zimbabwean dollar in 2003 - 2008, that has capital controls like Argentina, that has a poor population so they work with small transactions, but not poor enough so they still own a smartphone with internet access and they want to trade internationally then coinbase is a pretty decent option indeed at this given time.

Because internet connectivity in such countries and usability, we've been over this. You can use Citibank in Nigeria.
Anyway, you either have peer to peer transactions, or you have a hosted wallet. It's not peer to peer if you have to ask for permission from a 3rd party after which the 3rd party settles their internal database.
Look, what you're asking is very vague. Your asking for a bank that does bitcoin, but it can't be an actual bank. Your asking for no restrictions, but you want someone that controls what you do with your deposit.

Which cases?
As far as I understand your line you're saying at some point in time (after years??) you'll be relaying transactions and blocks, and that somehow makes read-only nodes valuable?
Maybe you're saying people will use their obsolete hardware to run as a pruned node, and it's less of a burden if such a node is already installed?
Maybe you're saying people will start relaying when they plug in to a power-source and wifi, which might have a bigger effect as raspberry pi nodes.
I honestly don't know. Again though, I don't dispute it's possible or won't happen, I just don't think a lot of people will use it. Definitely with 1Mb+ blocks in sight I doubt downloading all blocks is a great idea for anyones dataplan.

No you haven't.
If you want a hosted wallet anyone on earth can open, the answer is: there is none.
I assume you want a more practical answer, so I kinda need your location.
You can't send money around on the internal ledger of the hosted wallet without the 2nd person also having an account, so I need the location of the people you want to interact with in this way, or better put: what do you want to do (remittance / keeping score of your local poker game / buying stuff / ...)?
The ideology of bitcoin is baked into the code. Bitcoin is a p2p money transfer mechanism with a fixed supply currency. That's what it is. You can build a bank with bitcoin as currency, no problem, but when you ask for alternatives to such a bank my answer is that traditional banks are for more interesting because they have more experience, a government backing them, and people accepting it.

As u/trasla pointed out, it's not economically possible to be that low and usable.
From the moment someone keeps their bitcoin for even a short while the price increases.
Say everyone on earth wants to have $100 worth of bitcoin. 7 billion people and let's say a bitcoin supply of 15 million, that's $46667 for every bitcoin. Maybe you want to buy something worth $200, so you need more, but nobody wants to sell at 46667 because they want to keep $100 worth. So you offer a bit more, making the price go up and now people want to sell because they own slightly more than $100 worth of bitcoin now because the price went up.
That's theoretically. Practically you have speculators who want to predict when you want to have $200 worth, so they can anticipate and buy more before you do, and sell after you buy.
Add a couple of layers of complexity and you have the bitcoin-price today.

People here don't realize bitcoin can fail (I call a "regulated use only"-type thing also a fail). I'm not saying the world isn't better off with the invention of bitcoin, or that the potential isn't great. There's just a chance bitcoin can fail, and something else will take over that uses some kind of blockchain-tech.

Because it's almost always developers (I don't know for sure, but I assume so for this case). Which means they had enough support for it, despite the voices who said it would have a significant effect on bandwidth usage. That's the way these things work.
I was just making an example to show how the technology drives the change, not the companies wanting to do stuff with the technology (although more demand drives more funds for development, but that's not really relevant here).

If we're assuming coinbase accepts you for having a wallet (for buying/selling bitcoin it's a no go by default), and we're assuming you're one of the 1% that has internet access in your country, I'd still say going with a normal bank is the better option.

What would cause centralization with merge-mined side-chains? (outside of the fact small miners might not make the effort to mine small chains)  
It seems to me all centralization factors have to do with block-sizes and not the act of mining itself.

Well, in practice it'll be everyone else, so at least 88%, but the name of the attack is "the 51% attack".
Softforks activate at 95% support, so if viabtc has a 5% hashrate they can stop segwit from happening (as BU doesn't support it). Which means that if the rest of the miners want this to happen anyway they would have to reject viabtc/BU blocks to have 100% of the chain.

These systems already exists to a certain degree.  
Think gift cards, membership cards, etc. Any company that "holds" your money and gives you digital tokens for it.
Most of the time these tokens stay within the closed system, but sometimes they flock out. For example: you can buy bitcoin with amazon gift cards at purse.io, personally I've bought software and sold a t-shirt with and for pokerstars-money.
There's no need to have mining and whatnot, if you're centralizing everything anyway a simple database is way more efficient.

It's not a discussion really, otherwise I'd be happy to engage. It's just 2 people rattling off the same things they always say. 
You already know my answer, there's even no point in me saying it. I'm going to talk about the increase in blocksize from segwit which we're actually doing. To which I know you're going to reply it's way too complicated, just a hack, needs adoption to see results, etc. Than I'm going to say the same things you always hear, that it's worth doing anyway so why not, softforks are not as risky, wallets are ready, it's been tested severely, etc. From then on it gets either very lengthy or we focus on one aspect and we rattle one for a while until one of us is getting tired, bored or ,although rarely, we find a fundamental difference in opinion of what the future of bitcoin should be.
Things learned: 0  
Minds changed: 0  
Time wasted: lots
If you really want to discuss: I'm pro-segwit, in favor of doing a significant change to the concept of the blockchain (braiding, tree-chains, etc.) and only do a change of a constant if it's absolutely needed (like $1 fee) and non of the concept-changes are available.

I think the numbers where a bit unrealistic in order to get the lucky streak, but I certainly understand that argument. A lot of developers stated they wanted 95% because the entire community should be on the same page and whatnot, which doesn't really address Gavin's concern of 1 miner/miningpool being able to veto a softfork.
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:47:04
Does it only take live transactions/all of them?
iirc  took pre-defined transactions into the mix to get a specific number of transactions.

Yeah sorry, I don't want to do that.  
Your responses are just very headline-ish. They don't really tell what's going on and are very exaggerated.
I do understand the SPV reference now, and it's a valid argument against side-chains, but I'm not making an argument for or against side-chains.
Miners not validating is a problem bitcoin has right now, it's not bound to side-chains, but again though, it's an argument against side-chains, which I'm not arguing about because like I made clear: I don't know enough about it to do that.
I'm going to assume there's some misunderstanding about certain words, because this is going nowhere.
What exactly do you mean by centralization? I assumed it was mining centralization.
What I feel you are talking about (feel free to correct me, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth) is centralization of power, which is a problem indeed, but it doesn't take away from the fact it helps scaling. Just like coinbase transactions help scaling, or exchanging paper wallets for that matter. It might not be the scaling we want, but it is scaling. OP asked for proposals for scaling from the people that signed the letter, I provided. If one of the people on the list proposed to exchange paper wallets via pigeons, I would've included that.

If they're not really a bitcoin-business they'll likely just work with a payment provider, so it's the fault of the payment provider.
If you're really worried you could use the child-pays-for-parent mechanism. Meaning you could make a transaction spending the output from the delayed transaction with a high fee (paying for both transactions). Not all wallets will allow you to do that though.
@_date: 2016-10-12 05:46:36

How is the ability to get a free coffee once in a while a shitty feature? It might not be the feature we'd ideally want, but the fact is that you can double spend, which makes any wallet that is able to easily double spend transactions strictly better.
If we're going to count on users, miners and wallet developers acting in a moral and non-selfish way, then why are we using bitcoin?
If you sell coffee for bitcoin you can choose to not deliver to opt-in RBF transactions until they confirm as it's easily detected and can be defined as intention-to-doublespend, but the inherent problem that anyone can try and double spend for free still exists. With credit-cards you at least have the burden to ask your bank for a chargeback which might not get accepted and they'll notice when you do it often, with bitcoin you can try it every single time. Bitcoin is broken as an instant payment system. The lightning network or payment channels in general offer a great solution to this problem, however that does require you to let go of the idea that every single cup of coffee that has ever been purchased should be on everyone's hard-drive until the end of time.

The reason I'm pushing this a bit is because I'd love to hear from a developer what they think is the best way forward in this theoretical situation/attack. The answer has always been the answers you've been giving, but I'm honestly scared that we'll be in a long phase of stagnation if everyone keeps the "everything will be alright, just wait" stance. We know a single company can have 5% of hashpower and we now see that operators can be persuaded to do something even by (probably) a single guy with a bit of money. It's not such a stretch of imagination that large actors can accomplish something like this.

Bitcoin works because of the code and cryptography, not because the human element. Aliens and computer programs can use bitcoin as well.
Humans give it value, that's true, but we give it value because of the code and cryptography. That's why we prefer bitcoin over anything else. Bitcoin started out without value, and it worked. If at any point the code and cryptography doesn't work, it just simply doesn't work as a whole.

I think the main reason why people call the optimizations "scaling" is because without them bitcoin probably wouldn't function in any reasonable way.
You also need to fix all the issues before doing any vertical scaling. If you know that with an 8mb blocksize you can have blocks that take 11 minutes to verify, you need to fix that first before you start increasing the blocksize. Fixing those issues might not increase the amount of transactions, but without them you'll never be able to up the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-10-09 17:12:48
I mean that there's no possible way to have lightning transactions that aren't backed by bitcoins, if you can enlighten us on how this is possible you'd proof that payment channels/lightning network is broken by design.
Why would Bob send any products if he doesn't get a valid transaction? Or how would he get a valid transaction if the transaction is not spendable on the blockchain?
Look, I get what you mean, you don't need to explain to me what you mean, all I need to know is how. For there to be a decoupling at some point there needs to be something that isn't valuable but is viewed as valuable. USD was decoupled from silver by not making the coins in silver, which is done by not including silver in the coin. So how are you going to make (unbroadcasted) bitcoin transactions that don't include bitcoin (and why would anyone accept it)?
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:53:34

but oil etc. does change depending on the $ price. I don't get why so many people say comparing euro with usd is wrong because 1 euro remains 1 euro. if you store value in a different currency as the one you spend in, you'll have fluctuations.  that's not a bitcoin thing, that's a currency thing. If you want a really stable currency, don't use euro in the US or visa versa. Nor bitcoin anywhere.

You should read up a bit more I guess, not on any side, just what it is and how it works. It's not a hub, transactions aren't grouped, it's as P2P and uncontrolled as bitcoin.
The problem is that 2mb is as random of a number than 1mb. Even if 2mb is fine, we get the same shit when we hit full blocks again. Developers shouldn't be setting arbitrary numbers. Bitcoin unlimited tries to solve this, but I'm not a fan of that solution and neither are most developers. It might need to happen out of necessity if we don't get a more long term solution soon, but it's not really a future proof idea. But anyway, all I was saying is that segwit improves the throughput on-chain, I wasn't trying to claim it's better than anything else.
We stopped doing satoshis vision when the first ASIC came out. and that's fine, you can't foresee everything, neither the good nor the bad. The internet doesn't work like it was first envisioned anymore either. The only thing you can try to do is hold on to the initial values and I think we both hope bitcoin will do a better job than the internet at that.

We already hope the majority download and verify the signatures and data. It's a bit silly to call it non-block data imo, but I'll roll with it. You can't verify the on-chain data without downloading and verifying the non-block data, so there's really no difference, you can already download only blockheaders and skip signature verification if you want. It's part of the transactions, we just split it now, you make it sound like there's some extra stuff coming from god knows where.

While I agree to a certain extend, over-moderation causes community splits, group-thinking, us-vs-them mentality, etc.
So much of the shit we get here is from the misinformed circlejerk over at r/btc . When this all started there wasn't as much communication between developers and community as there is now, so I certainly understand the reasoning behind the moderation back then, but I think it does show the downside of over-moderation and partitioning the community. As well as chasing away knowledgeable people and people who contribute good content which adds to the misinformation.
There used to be this mentality of "altcoins are a great testbed for bitcoin". Now we have a strictly 'no altcoin talk unless it's negative'-policy, and everyone seems to have become bitcoin maximalists..

1) 50%+ (back when the 1Mb, 25 second block was made ( (later optimizations have reduced this time drastically, which was really the point I was making)
2) There are massive amounts of companies and software that want to use the bitcoin blockchain. See Kim Dot Com for example, he was forced to seek off-chain solutions, as bitcoin is not anywhere close to handling a huge load like that. 
The problem with an 11 minute block is that it kinda breaks bitcoin (it'll survive, but it's going to get messy) which means that in order to "break" bitcoin you need to be able to make 1 block. That's not a great security feature.
And that's just one thing. You also don't wait until it takes 3 months to sync a newly full node, you must find solutions when it's at 1 week, because otherwise it's too late. And there's tons of issues that you need to prepare for when increasing the load.
@_date: 2016-10-10 08:18:22
I think there where some really good questions afterwards which pinpoint the concerns for this.
The concern of what happens when the attacker gets only the back-up key, now they can threaten to destroy your funds if you don't send it to them.
But imo more importantly: I think it burdens a lot of possible future improvements and a lot of things build on top of bitcoin, which I don't think is worth it as there's already some decent security schemes that can be done with timelocks and multisig.

Some people like the differences in that "useless alt".
Core has the most developers and the most innovations build on it, most nodes, etc. Yet I've got a slight feeling you wouldn't call any other implementation or chain coming from alternative clients "useless".
Peter didn't claim he was on the "real" bitcoin side. The "real" bitcoin is whatever you as a user define as the real bitcoin. I've said this somewhere else but I'll repeat: BU needs a hardfork to change the blocksize thing, Core doesn't need that. It's a bit of an asshole move to force everyone else to fork (and waste those peoples time) while you're the one who needs it. In both cases we'll end up in 2 chains.
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:12:33

@_date: 2016-10-11 12:11:37
If you don't relay segwit supported blocks, you're really just doing the same thing, you try to reduce BU miners to 0% effective hashrate.
In theory this would be better, the node operators doing this, but it doesn't change anything as miners have their own relay network.
If viabtc maintains their veto I think anything that follows has bad implications.
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:59:34


I think that would be the worst outcome from all the realistic outcomes. As I read more about ViaBTC there might be a decent amount of monetary pressure behind it, so I wouldn't be so surprised.
A lot of developers have spoken against the 75% threshold Gavin Andresen proposed for softforks. For this reason I think changing the threshold is unlikely, although it would make the most sense.
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:56:58

In general: if you want to get help (for anything, not only bitcoin), you give as much information as you can. u/BashCo asked for information and you go: I have some of that information, but I don't know if it'll help.
That's not how you do things: best is to say: I got a transaction from company/site A, using wallet B, with transaction C, etc. this is what happened. Even if you think the information is irrelevant. Without information you might as well ask us to cure a magic unicorn.

Yes, because those developers chose the activation threshold, chose to do it as a softfork, both often disputed by "the others". If it happens, it just happens, don't think there's any blame/fault, but if you're going to blame I prefer to blame the game instead of the players.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:38:08
I personally am the most scared of that outcome, as it's stagnation without any knowledge of when/if it'll improve. Do you really want to introduce all those new developments onto something that isn't even live on mainnet?
How long are we going to wait before we decide it's bullshit and fork them out? Or are we just not letting any development go through unless we all oblige to the demands of the 5%?
Besides that, it introduces a new notion of veto-power. Imagine some privacy enhancing softfork (and really, segwit is a stepping stone towards that), do you really want 5% of hashpower being able to stop that? 5% is very realistic to obtain by a state-actor.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:21:03

That's indeed an issue. Afaik there's currently nothing that is as effective as the covenants proposal, the question is whether it's worth the cost, which will depend on the long term view and how costly it really is for other applications (which I really don't have a clue about).

Given it's already on a coinbase wallet just selling it on there and withdraw to your bank seems to make the most sense.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:36:12
A long term fork attack is way more costly as you need to get more miners all the time as the hashrate grows, plus maintain it and pay electricity. So the only thing you can really do is something short, which will have massive damages, but I think bitcoin can survive.

I must admit I don't know a lot about side-chains, but as I understand it it's taking load off the main-chain, which I agree isn't really a scaling mechanism, but it does help scaling.

Maybe you should read the whitepaper, and maybe look up the word analogy as well.
I'm sorry to talk like this, but you initially stated merge-mined sidechains would be worse for centralization, for which you gave no reasoning at all. When asked, you reply with a hypothetical question (which I answer,but you don't respond to) and for some reason you add SPV into the mix which is neither comparable nor similar.
Responding to none of my answers you reply again stating miners can confiscate coins, again, no explanation.
I get the basics of side-chains, I understand the security model. I never stated anywhere side-chains are a great idea, I just stated it would help with scaling and could therefor be considered a partial solution.
All I'm asking is why merged-mined sidechains would be worse for centralization.

That's what I assumed because of the timing of this.
In a way it's an interesting thing to see what happens when a mining pool uses his veto power. I don't know a lot about ViaBTC, but it would be most interesting if they had a lot of hashpower under their own control. Couple of things can happen:
- Hashers move to another pool
- Other pools 51% attack them
- The threshold of activation is lowered
- Everything stagnates until either they or everyone else switches
Not that I hope it will happen, but it's interesting.
@_date: 2016-10-09 07:09:43
But what if 2 blockchains exist that can't take each other out because they're so different from each other? I totally agree, no blockchain that does what bitcoin does will survive. ethereum will likely never overtake bitcoin as money, because bitcoin is simply better money. But I also doubt bitcoin will overtake ethereum as they focus on being a smart contact system. They will sacrifice decentralization for a better smart contract system, those are trade offs bitcoin will never make.
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:10:58
Miners have the power to continue, which is at 51%, but I agree it's no magic number either. 
The economic validators aren't in consensus either, so that that's just a long way of saying: hardfork into two chains.
I get the "might makes right" sentiment, but what about bitcoin being resistant to attacks? A 5% veto power makes any chain attackable (and I see forced 0 progress as an attack). That would mean hardforks for every consensus change, which is a path that can be taken, but oh boy the irony...
I agree 95% is technically a great number. I'm talking about attacks though, which is likely now the case, I don't think this mining pool genuinely thinks segwit is a bad idea, so information won't really work imo.
@_date: 2016-10-10 13:45:42
All they need is 6% (which they might have them self). Would you say segwit is not a good idea if 6%, who might as well get payed by a single actor/state, doesn't support it?

You're entirely missing the point here. If you want to discuss whether or not we should do a hardfork blocksize increase, go to r/btc, nearly every post is about the subject. It's been nearly 2 years since the fuss began, we probably both have heard any and all arguments on either side, let's just agree to disagree.
All I'm saying is that these optimizations are viewed by many as "scaling" despite not directly getting more transactions onto the chain. These optimizations where needed to get to the current level, to safely get to segwit-sized blocks and will be needed to go beyond that.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:43:51
You must be new here :)
Changetip is a service that let's you tip someone in bitcoin by mentioning changetip and some amount (which can be things like 'beer', 'coffee', etc.).  It use to be very popular, but ever since they introduced withdrawal fees (to get your bitcoins out of changetip) it's much less used.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:01:05
Yes, you can get on the sidechain, but you can't softfork on that sidechain because of the same issues as the main chain. So you'll have to move to other sidechains for every softfork (assuming every softfork gets attacked, which is reasonable if we assume merged mining). Although the sidechains approach is safer, there's not that much difference with just hardforking. Merchants will still need to upgrade to accept payments.
In general my scepticism for sidechains is entirely about the security ON the sidechain. I think there's some solid work being done on 2-way pegging, not that concerned about that.
This is all theoretical btw, don't want to sound like a concern troll, I fully agree it's probably not going to be an issue.

That's more or less child-pays-for-parent (not implemented yet though).   
There's also first-seen-safe replace-by-fee, which basically only allows to add extra outputs in the double spend. iirc that's what F2Pool is/was running for quite a while now. It's apparently hard to implement for wallets though. If there's demand for it from wallet vendors they'll implement it.

Most developers don't like the idea of a government-like system where 51% decides, as the goal should be to design things everyone agrees is good.
If not everyone agrees it's good and they still want the changes to be made, they can fork off. Since segwit is such an important thing for a lot of people that'll mean segwit will be forked. Which leaves segwit-chain and old-chain, which is actually not what BU wants, because they need a hard fork to change the blocksize thing. Since segwit can be a softfork it would just be much better if BU did the hardfork they need anyway, as it would end up in the same result: segwit-chain and BU-chain, but it would save Core countless of hours developing a safe mechanism to fork, to push the information about the fork out there, to wait until everyone who wants to update updates, etc.

I've been coining this in the comments a few times already.   
It seems relatively simple to add an RBF flag on URI's (if you already implement something that deals with RBF specifically).   
You'll get something like bitcoin:&lt;bitcoin-address&gt;?RBF=0
Or if you force it: bitcoin:&lt;bitcoin-address&gt;?req-RBF=0 that'll make wallets that don't implement it consider it as invalid though.
Don't think this is controversial in any way, only problem is finding someone who cares enough to actually code it imo.

Ah ok, I see.
I guess it would be interesting to plot this out on a graph, how expensive it gets when fees rise (or what the fee-goal is for the attacker, and how much he needs to reach the goal). Maybe add some different ratios of legitimate transactions (50/60/70/80/90% legit transactions).

That's because we're talking about different things :)
The statement I think is false is: " Merge-minded doesn't help scaling at all. 1MB + 19MB merge-mined sidechain would be much worse than 20MB main chain for centralization."
To be practical: If we switch to 100mb blocks today, hardly anyone can run a full node, and there will be big implications for mining-centralization. If we have a 1mb main-chain and 99 1mb side-chains, we don't have those issues, whether those chains are merge-mined or not.

Nothing ever gets enough support if people only support something when it has enough support.
What makes you think miners won't feel angry about a longer term UASF? They do need a majority of hashpower to pull of an unsupported MASF and they're pretty much digging their own grave if they'd do so.
Signaling for segwit is easy, non-upgraded miners are still supported.

If you're tumbling every time, there can be no such thing as counterparty, colored coins, etc.
There might be extra scalability concerns as well.

It&gt;Funny how something that was originally being sold as a fix for malleability and not scaling is now being sold as a scaling solution. The only reason the block size hasn't been raised is because of blockstream, Bitcoin has undergone several hard fork without failure and if segwit, an incredibly complex and untested solution, is allowed to happen then this second layer tech garbage is going to hinder the original system of what Bitcoin was/is. Bitcoin is a DECENTRALIZED P2P uncontrolled money, that is untrue if LN becomes our realty
It helps scaling on chain, that's my main point. Not selling anything... segwit has been running for years on sidechains and months on testnet... Ln is also not what you describe.

Didn't realize the federated peg was with current codebase, although I should've known, as I know elements runs on testnet.
I'm not a computer, so there is a thing like upgrades for me ;) 
It depends on how you define "we". Now we define "we" as 95%, which is really an arbitrary number. The non-arbitrary number is 51%.
From an ideological viewpoint the cleanest way to deal with this is to  hardfork into segwit and non-segwit bitcoin, but there's a lot of irony in that.
I'm still fairly sceptical around sidechains, as I haven't seen a way to mine the sidechains that pleases me. There's also the issue of coin-acceptance, as people shouldn't accept every pegged coin, but should accept genuinely used and safe pegged coins. But we're getting off-topic.
Personally I favor a "95% if we can, 51% if we must" approach. Either by decreasing the threshold or by miners 51% attacking them. It's more ugly, but I'd prefer that over hardforking or sidechaining.

To make a significant change in the blockchain you need consensus among among miners, nodes, wallet-developers, etc.
If only 5 people would use anonymity features on top of bitcoin, it'll never reach consensus to build it into the protocol anyway.
You're basically giving the middlefinger to all projects that use metadata, all people who want to be transparent and all projects that don't involve standard transactions (payment channels, sidechains, ...), just to force anonymity onto people. If you want it so bad, maybe you should consider darkcoin.
I truly hope darkwallet will become popular, that there will be a "dark" sidechain (if that ever becomes a thing), that stealth addresses will become the standard, etc. but let's not forget there are more things than anonymous payments going on in bitcoin.

No, legacy miners will see segwit blocks as valid (as will every other node). Old style blocks are still accepted by the network as well. The only risk for miners falsely signaling is when someone creates an invalid segwit block, old style nodes and miners will accept that block, while segwit nodes and miners won't.

Activation might not be the best word now that I think of it.

It's weird to me people don't understand an idea they support until someone they deem important points it out.
Would give it the same pause of thought if that post was made by Mike Hearn?
It surely would be nicer to activate it in a clean way, but do we really care to delay it so long in order to have it nicer for the non-segwit signaling miners?
It surely distorts the BIP9 incentives, but are we really going to continue to use BIP9 for future deployments if we know it's going to be used for political pressure by miners?

Your ignorance is an insult to humanity.
If you want lower fees, "doesn't solve a problem" segwit ups the blocksize to 2-ish MB. This "doesn't solve a problem" new address type is more efficient and thus more will fit into a block.
It seems to fix everything you want, so why don't you support it? That way we can have all the rest of the technological advantages it gives, which you don't care for, as well. Everybody happy, no?

I think it has value to know certain exchanges that pretend to be a wallet sometimes randomly freeze funds, despite the fact you'll get unfrozen at some point in the future.
I think it has value to know blockchain.info keeps producing mistakes over and over again. Although they might be solved individually.
There's obviously differences in how you can present your experience, but knowing the user experience of certain products helps people decide. Everyone makes mistakes, but if those mistakes are hidden, no one can know whether it's a one time occurrence or they are so incompetent they keep making mistake after mistake.

There's people who have been living on bitcoin for years now, so yes it's certainly possible.
In everyday life there's a false sense of stability. Prices are denoted in a national currency and unless you have hyper-inflation products only change in price sporadically. However, the currency is fluctuating all the time against other currencies. Paying/earning in bitcoin is like paying on a holiday in another country, you pay a different conversion-rate every time you pay something. This isn't that big of a concern though, unless you live from paycheck to paycheck.
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:59:41

Which ones have more than 1mb blocks? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:12:27
Not an expert, but the idea is simple: you hash all [UTXOs]( together, when someone sends you a transaction they can prove it's a valid UTXO from that hash. It also allows you to just start your node with the UTXO hash in the software, which can be verified, and start updating it from that point on.
Recently there's been a proposal to do this in a very efficient way, but without the proofs.   
Point is: the only thing that matters for you is that you know the UTXOs a transaction uses are valid. At the moment this happens by verifying the transactions and keeping a database of the UTXOs (currently about 2Gb). This doesn't change the need to verify blocks and transactions as they come though, it only decreases the on-disk storage and makes syncing from scratch unnecessary.

Well they should propose to change Segwit so it doesn't include a blocksize increase then. You don't add things to come to consensus, you remove things and only leave the parts where everyone agrees with. Like with segwit address format (BIP142). Not everyone was on the same page, so it wasn't included in the current segwit softfork. Now there's BIP173 which is an improvement on BIP142 and has more support. That's how things should work. 
Developers thought the "increase the blocksize-people" would be happy with segwit increasing the blocksize, but apparently they're wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:46:19
No, but there are a ton of reasons to do both segwit and the address format without the blocksize increase. It's possible to do segwit without increasing capacity, but that would be rather silly imo. 
A lot of people want segwit regardless of the blocksize increase. Why not take a 'free' blocksize increase to go along with it? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:36:35

Not everyone wants a split.
There's a difference between: 
- we want X and Y, so we're not going to do X if we don't get Y.
- We want X but not Y, so we're going to do X.
Everyone wants more capacity than what segwit offers. Why you think people are so eager to work on native segwit adresses, schnorr, MAST, sidechains, etc.? Why you think people are actively thinking about ways to do hardforks safely?
If we haven't found a way to do hardforks that nearly everyone agrees with, doesn't mean that's a reason to stop developments that nearly everyone does agree with.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:46:47
No, but miners can. If miners run buggy software and make larger blocks the network splits. If there's economic activity on both sides, you permanently split the chain, or you cause economical damage. While if everyone is on the same side, miners don't have any incentive to mine further on the other chain.

I honestly don't know enough about the technical details of either project to comment on that. There's, allegedly, a working internal build of sidechains while the lightning network has nothing more than an idea. We don't really know how any of the projects work in practice, so it's pretty debatable to state problem X will be solved with one of these technologies.
What I'm really pointing at though is that there is no single answer and we don't even know the question. Sidechains and lightning can co-exist. Maybe one of them will take off, maybe both, maybe non. It's good to know scalability problems can be solved, but there's no need to take giant leaps forward. When creating the early internet people didn't design for HD video-streaming either, things just evolved in that direction.

There are "standard " transactions in bitcoin, which means they are known by the client and there are non standard transactions, which are still valid but they won't put them in their mempool or relay them (I think) . This allows for soft forks, since older clients will view the new transaction as non standard but valid.

There's no shame in not recognizing bitcoin as important. Most people dismiss it at first. I said: cute, but I'll wait for google-coin to come around.

Most people have a story like that.
As for not spending too much time on reddit: there are browser plugins that limit your time you can spend on sites you list.  
Personally I don't have television, but I do spend too much time on reddit and things alike. I'd say you need to dig deeper to recognize important/interesting things, so naturally you'll spend more time on the interwebs doing that.

You seem young, so I'll give this general life advise:
Never regret anything. First of all, regret gets you nowhere. Secondly, you made the best decision you could have based on the knowledge you had at the time. Now you have new knowledge and learned if you made any mistakes.
Make your own decisions, don't seek validation. Lots of people keep the school-mentality throughout life, where someone holds your hand and tells you what to do. People do whatever parents, family, friends or society in general tells them what to do. No one knows anything, there's no teacher with a textbook that has the answers, you yourself are always best placed to decide what to do.
Also: hindsight is always 20/20

Didn't we just come to the conclusion segwit is on-chain expansion?
No one was talking about LN. No one knows how LN is going to pan out, no one knows if there will be major hubs or not. However, with or without segwit, LN will be on Bitcoin. It will require a lot of rework and some ugly fixes, but it can be done without segwit, and much easier if other malleability fixes are accepted. Not getting segwit doesn't stop the LN. True microtransactions where never possible without custodial accounts, LN fixes that, so I'd say even in some hub-and-spokes configuration LN is a benefit to Bitcoin. (but that as an aside, as said: segwit doesn't stop LN)

No, although it's reasonable to assume there will be some extra orphaning going on (but that's the same for every non-BIP91 node, which is 99% of nodes). I'd recommend not accepting any 1-confirmation transactions when it activates.

That's what I want you to do. But apparently communicating like a normal human being is hard.
Let's do this the idiotic way then.
Since segwit transactions enable more transactions per block and thus larger total blocksize everyone benefits from that, even though non-upgraded nodes will still see a 1mb block, in reality it will be bigger because of the segwit transactions.

BIP 149 is a response to that. However that will take a while to deploy and activate. BIP 148 will bring some disruption, there's no way around that. But BIP 148 is happening anyway, so might as well try to make it work.

The problem with BIP 8 is that it forces an update, even if that update is unsafe /not longer the best option. That's not really a problem for segwit, but we probably get segwit with bip148 or x2 anyway. There's always tradeoffs you're making.

At the conference all proposals will come together and they can compare them with actual data from tests.  
First they need to agree on a proposal, then they can talk about the technical details of it.
IIRC Jeff Garzik was working on 3 different blocksize proposals and I'm sure there will be more.

I understand the definition of compromise, however this is an open source project, not a government. Stuff we agree on gets in, stuff we don't agree on doesn't. If there's enough people that don't agree on certain changes or general direction, a fork is created. That's why we have like a 1000 altcoins. That's how open source works.
Compromise is how politics work, open source projects should be devowed of politics as much as possible. It's the only way to do it. It's the "don't negotiate with terrorists" strategy. Even if the demands of the terrorists are reasonable, giving in will only encourage more terrorism.

Bitcoin is whatever the economic majority says it is. The idea is to get the economic majority on BIP148 so we can call it Bitcoin. I'd agree if it doesn't get that majority it can't be called Bitcoin.
I think there's a lot of concerns to be had when BIP148 doesn't get any significant hashpower (10%-ish), but for that to be the case it has to fail. Which is a bit of a circular argument: we don't support it because if we don't support it, it's unsafe.
Calling BIP148 not Bitcoin and unsafe by definition is simply not true. It all depends on what the economy does, if the economy chooses BIP148 it's the non-BIP148 chain that's unsafe by design.
There are functional test being written if you want to test out the code, like: 
The problem with the idea of "Bitcoin will need to lose value before miners upgrade" is that we know some miners have an unfair advantage over the competition which is lost when upgrading (well, at least obvious when upgrading), which means they can take a significantly higher amount of loss than what game theory dictates. It would also mean that Bitcoin can not be upgraded without significant loss of value, as miners are shown to hold upgrades as political hostage. Even Rusty, who co-authored BIP9, said a UASF is a far superior method for network upgrades.
I think it's bad to call people ignorant and whatnot, but it's also bad to call people idiots. Lead by example.

Because the security of the lightning network relies on being able to actually broadcast the transaction. That doesn't mean you have to do it. It's like holding a gun to someones face, even though you don't shoot, you still need the gun in order to have the same power position.

As we're seeing now with the Venezuelan Bolivar, being able to pay governments doesn't give your currency value. The basic value comes from the simple idea of: "does this currency store the value I'm giving away long enough for me to redeem that value somewhere else?"
Bitcoin offers some additional bonuses, like:
- no government nor bank has any control over it
- it can be transacted to anyone, anywhere, anytime
- it's programmable, meaning you can have security and features that otherwise can only be done by going through a legal system with tons of legal contracts that will never be as definite as a bitcoin contract.
- the supply is finite, other than any other currency that can start printing new money at will.
Probably missing a ton, but that comes to mind. I'd recommend watching some Andreas Antonopoulos videos, he's great at explaining how great Bitcoin is.

You don't really have a wallet, you have an account.
Pros: easy to buy bitcoins, re-occurring payments.
cons: You don't own the bitcoins. Coinbase can block transaction if they don't like to whom your sending to. The whole verification process can be a pain from what I heard.
There are many good ways. Having an offline new installation PC/laptop with armory so you can do offline signing is a pretty good way.
Hardware wallets are pretty good too.

Their blocksize is really small, but they have a much faster blocktime.
If the charts of  are correct the average blocksize is currently about 5kb, and about 5500 blocks are made in a day, so that's roughly 27.5Mb a day. Bitcoin does 140-ish Mb a day.

Maybe you can copy the raw transaction (right-click on transaction) and try to send it via

The problem is many people genuinely believe segwit is just some way to complicated work around, and things could be massively better with a hard fork. You should stop making stuff up, whatever the reason for it is. You're just saying random things in the hope there's truth in it. 
We can do schnorr signatures with segwit, so we can actually make transactions smaller without hard fork...

I fully agree and made this point (or wanted to make) several times.
Trustless is a word pretty much only used in bitcoin in this way. Search the word "trustless" and much of the results are bitcoin related (even on anonymous search engines).

"Independently predictable" would make more sense imo. (edit: or better: trust-minimizing as esympdote said here)

What exactly do you propose to do? "some other approach" is a bit vague.
The question of: "how should we do transactions if we would create them from scratch?" has been asked before. Namely by the people from blockstream when they created their sidechain Elements Alpha. Since this is effectively the same as a hardfork any choice could've been made. They actually chose/invented segregated witness (along with schnorr signatures, confidential transactions and whatnot). It wasn't until a few months later Luke-jr found a way to do this as a softfork, that it was considered doing for the Bitcoin main chain.
Segwit was invented from the idea of: what should transactions look like, if we wouldn't have to mind backwards compatibility.

Although I agree the general population might not move to bitcoin, I don't agree with most things you're saying.
1. People care about how much they pay. If a business is giving a discount when paying with bitcoin people care. I can order my pizza right now online and pay with a lot of options +fee, or I can pay with bitcoin without fee.
2. Remittance is a big market. Although you're right people are looking for a cheaper western union, the currency of sending doesn't matter.
3. Chargebacks can be implemented with multisig.
4. It being good or bad is personal opinion, but I don't think it'll happen anyway.
5. People don't want to be their own bank, but people don't want bankers either. Ask Cypriots if they care about bankers.
6. Transaction volume can make up for this. Not saying it will, but it can.
7. "Trust math" is a stupid selling point indeed, "don't trust people or organisations" is.
8. Yes
9. Tell that to an Argentinian, Greek, ...

There's different approaches that could be taken. You could try to make the profitability of building an ASIC (the optimized-for-one-task chip) very low, so users could mine with off-the-shelf GPU's. It's however impossible to make something entirely "ASIC-proof", so at some point it might make sense to make specialized hardware again.
You could also make it something that's well researched and ASIC-friendly, so many companies have the capacity and knowledge to manufacture them.

There's more to it than your transaction. Try do it for 1000 funders.
Instead of cherry-picking, tell me the story of decentralized exchanges. You need counterparty to do it and you can only exchange things that are on the bitcoin blockchain. The 10 minute blocktime is also pretty annoying for this purpose.
Ethereum isn't even launched and people have build DOA's, crowdfunding platforms, decentralized exchanges, p2p storage, p2p messaging, etc.

There are many reasons not to run segwit2x, because developers who worked on Bitcoin don't agree with it isn't one of them.
If we, users, think segwit2x is the way to go, we should follow the x2 chain. If there are developers that choose to stop working on bitcoin because of that, that's sad but not a dealbreaker.
Developers are free to do whatever they want, but it's the users who decide what software to run, and which software they trust to enforce the consensus rules everyone else is enforcing.
Luckily developers have a lot of common sense and they tend to do things that are good for bitcoin, which is in line with what users want.

Bitstamp recently lost a large amount due to a hack and they're losing market share, so they might have trouble somewhere along the road.
Coinbase has a lot of funding behind it, shit can happen and they'll still survive.
Kraken seems to have their shit together. Don't recall any bad story of them.
BTC-E has every red light there is burning on them, but they're (afaik) the oldest still running exchange out there, so they must be doing something right.

It's not about ease of use, it's about efficiency. It's hard to beat near zero cost electricity with dedicated people making sure there's 100% uptime under perfect conditions. 
I think there's something to be said about solar panel owners that have excess electricity or windmills that are down because low demand, but we're still a long way removed from the point its profitable to not have much uptime even in a near zero cost electricity environment.

I'm not judging sides, I'm talking about the 2mb+segwit increase. 
There are tons of ideas, that doesn't mean there is agreement. Personally I like something like the "evil softfork", but many are against. 
We don't need to Hardfork segwit. That's a circular argument. See the Hardfork wishlist, which is outdated last time I checked, but still has some worthwhile stuff on it. 
I'm not so hippidihop, what's 'swag' in this context? 
There's no agreement on this silly 2mb +segwit stuff either. Doesn't change anything or terms of politics.
I'm up for talking about a Hardfork ,but delaying segwit for it is stupid and counterproductive.

Maybe scheduling, maybe they feel like they aren't up-to-date enough  with the latest PR's to be productive. At least for Gavin and Jeff (who both were at devcore this weekend). Mike disagrees with how things are organized in bitcoin on a fundamental level I feel, so I don't think he has any intend to be at these meeting.
Bear in mind though that these are mostly technical discussions about the most urgent and close-to-be-finished BIP's and PR's. There's 327 contributors to bitcoin-core alone, but if you haven't reviewed any PR's / BIPS or you don't have any question to others about what you're working on, these meetings have little value.

Core should provide software that stays in consensus, so users don't lose money. Adding easy ways to not follow the majority hash rate isn't that imo. Maybe if everyone starts changing their uacomment there's reason to think consensus isn't where the majority hash rate is, but until then... 
I'm sure we can easily crowd fund some developer time to test the bip148 software if that's a concern.

Sure it can. If people start using it the price will go up to whatever amount to support it.
It wouldn't make any sense to say something has intrinsic value and the exact same thing not.

If you held the etc up to this date the value is similar. 
But either way, there's only one example of a chain fork split and that was under total different circumstances. Don't think it gives any Indication.

@_date: 2017-05-16 17:23:25
I think we should avoid chain splits as much as possible. If some follow other rules than others, chain splits happen. For bip148 this is a conscious and timed split (if hash rate stays as is), for block size it can happen at any time which makes it worse. 
But anyway, I'm not here to discuss blocksize or emerging consensus.

Segwit is all about collecting data. There's just things that you can't test on a testnet. 
There's not even any sort of mutual vision on how to do a Hardfork. Like what the safest way would be, if / what other things to include, etc. Like personally I would need a lot of convincing to accept a Hardfork that doesn't solve any issue and only bumps the blocksize. 
Even if there was an agreement on how and what, testing everything, then waiting for everyone to upgrade will take at least a year. We can have segwit running in two weeks.

To be more correct: The version field is a hexadecimal representation of a 32 digit binary number.
0x20000012 gives us in binary: 0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0010
The first 001 was used in previous softforks before BIP9 and must remain that way to keep backwards compatibility.
BIP9 starts using the bits at the back, so for BIP68 bit number 0 (programmers always start counting from 0) was used. Segwit is using bit number 1, which gives us a 2 in HEX. For BIP91 bit number 4 was used, so the above binary field shows us they are signaling segwit and BIP91, resulting in the HEX of 20000012.

9 times actually, one of them being "blocksize". I get your point, but no need to include stupid things like that. Let's be mature.  
I think what my posts show is that there are currently a lot of problems in bitcoin. Although it's debatable, you can say that what works at 1mb is going to work at 8mb, however, there are a decent amount of issues that are problems under 1mb which will be extremely bad under 8mb.
I think almost every week something is implemented that improves scalability in one way or another. There's not a single developer that doesn't think something needs to happen. But what good are 8mb blocks if it can be attacked to only include 100 transactions in it (sigops flooding attack), just to pick something from this week?    
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:13:29
Because people don't even agree on what the agreement said. Plus a UASF gets us segwit in 2 months. A Hardfork needs to be discussed on how to do it, it needs to be implemented and tested by every software out there, possible other optimizations and features should be added, it has to be rolled out to every user... Realistically you're looking at at least a year. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:59:31
Given the quick look I had at your posting history I assumed you played stupid, which I don't sympathize with. My bad for assuming bad faith I guess.
The segwit softfork includes an on-chain increase. I advise to read up on segwit before shouting out uninformed opinions. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:49:39


There's no practical difference (if we're talking about a 2mb increase). well, segwit makes the transition to schnorr signatures easier, but that difference is in favor of segwit. 


Yes, sorry. 


LN is written assuming segwit, that's a design decision made very early on, so the lack of segwit would need a rewrite. That's why there where lightning transactions only a few hours after segwit activated on litecoin. 


It's a valid concern, although that worry is majorly dependent on how LN works out. If it turns out to be very decentralized and private, that would be a good outcome imo. 
In the long term we'll need every solution out there. Segwit will increase the blocksize a bit, LN might take a small load off the network, schnorr will make transaction sizes smaller and allow for some aggregation. And we'll move forward step by step. I hope some day there's enough consensus on how to do a Hardfork and what to include in it, so we can fix the problem of the hard-coded limit.

Well, there's the avalon which is reasonable (although not anywhere close to the smaller difference between AMD and Nvidia).
The ASIC manufacturing is certainly a problem in Bitcoin, but in the end it's the people who run the miners that dictate whether it's centralized or not. And that's also a problem in Bitcoin, as it's Bitmain who has a lot of them, but I have no clue about Ethereum. I know 2 pools have half of the network, but I don't know if there's any information out there how many different actors those pools have.

Why do you keep downgrading the complexity of this subject? Decentralized cryptocurrencies are something completely new, where do you think you'll find a "simple, open-source algorithm" that you can just "place on the transactions"? Think a bit further how this would work. How do you verify if transactions in a block are valid if all outputs are mixed? How do you prevent people from matching the amount of the input with the output? How do you send the metadata attached to certain coins? How do you prevent miners/mixers from knowing which coins went where? How do you scale this to hundreds of transactions a second? How will this affect side-chains, payment-channels, etc.?
It's very likely you'll be able to be completely anonymous with things like darkwallet by the time there's a buggy testnet implementation of dark-bitcoin.

Does Lightning require Segregated Witness?
Yes, but not in theory. You could make a poorer lightning network without it, which has higher risks when establishing channels (you might have to wait a month if things go wrong!), has limited channel lifetime, longer minimum payment expiry times on each hop, is less efficient and has less robust outsourcing. The entire spec as written today assumes segregated witness, as it solves all these problems.
Segwit also solves tons of other issues and opens up tons of possibilities. It's sad we need to put the miners under significant pressure before they choose to upgrade the protocol and it's sad they choose to upgrade in such a roundabout way.

I just told you the u3 is 10 times less efficient than the s9, with USB you are limited in terms of power supply which affects the design. You can connect an external power supply, but at that point you might as well get a full grown miner. There's plenty of them for sale on eBay. You can also just mine with your gpu if loss doesn't matter. 
Currently there's hardly anyone mining on old miners, USB miners or gpu's. I don't think that's going to change massively any time soon. Besides, if people do run it like they do full nodes, that means there's 7800 people doing it, as that's how many listening nodes there are. If all of them where running 10 of the most efficient USB miners, which get 10gh/s a piece, that would amount to a grand total of 780Th. Which is around 0.014% of the network. If those 7800 people would all invest the $1300 for an s9, mining at a pure loss as most consumer electricity prices are too high, it would amount to ~1,8% of the network, that's still insignificant. Granted, a wider spread of hardware might make it cheaper, but it's always going to be a big loss to run it and there's just not enough people that want to do this out of charity (as the amount of full node runners doesn't even cut it).

It didn't matter whether you had fiat or bitcoin on Mt.Gox.

You don't publicly question mods about their moderation is the basic idea.
Moderation is to combat abuse, not to force opinions.
As to why there are so many "trolls": Because it gets really annoying to see all the blind optimism and massive downvoting of divergent opinions, and some people can't keep their emotions in check and make their own posts more extreme.

I understand that concern for companies that have a lot of core developers, like blockstream, but for individuals it's extremely hard to have a conflict of interest in an open source project.

Banking experience as a 30 year old Belgian:
* We all use debit cards, I've never owned a credit card
* I bought my car with my card, a card being denied for any amount sounds ludicrous.
* Most people under 60 use online banking. It's been 5 years+ since I last stepped into a physical bank. I got an account with two banks and one of them doesn't even have physical locations in Belgium.
* We can send and receive money to people anywhere in Europe (those who use €) for free. Not even a miners fee.
* I've never even seen a cheque/check IRL, let alone use it.
* When I was younger it took longer, but nowadays when I transfer money, it gets there the next day.
* I've swiped my card maybe twice in my life, our cards have a chip so we just stick it in the machine instead of swiping it.
* The same chip is able to hold funds. Like a bitcoin wallet. The money is on the card itself. Despite the marketing it never really took off, because it's just more inconvenient without any upside (it could be used in offline machines, but most merchants have online machines anyway and since no-one used it, no-one made investments to get it into their vending machine).
I might be missing some things, but that comes to mind :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:26:55
Although I made my post just to say I expected a bit more criticism, I'll answer.
1) It has worked well in the past? Really? Like the banking industry?
Crypto-currencies are nothing new, they've existed for a long time. The reason bitcoin is big now is because governments can't easily stop it.
Electricity and workforces are pretty cheap in china, mining will naturally grow towards that area. Do you really want the majority of mining in a country like China? If bitcoin becomes mainstream thousands of applications will run on it. Do you expect every app to even be able to jump to a forked blockchain (without whatever Chinese government told the miners to do)?
2) Like in 1, just because it's a natural evolving thing doesn't mean the outcome is something we want.
Having a small group of developers is fine in other open source projects. There's no economy resting on it, and if certain developers  want it in another way they just fork the project. There can be only one bitcoin blockchain in practice, good luck forking it and getting miners to switch.
People here despise the idea so few people are in control of the global financial world, yet if few people actually have a say in the future of bitcoin that's no problem?
3) Same thing again. It's like saying: if you don't like what banks are doing, why don't you create your own bank.
How many posts are here about so called "payed chills"? Yet the bitcoin foundation mailing coindesk to change their article to not name Peter Todd as a core developer is just fine?

Not only having 2 physical currencies in circulation, but having a constantly changing exchange rate between them is a pain.

Blocking segwit and not accepting low fee transactions is an entirely different thing.
I think it's perfectly fine to use the rhetoric of "but f2pool doesn't even mine low fee transactions" when discussing blocksize / mining centralization and whatnot, but to make a stand-alone point of it is a bit stretching imo. This is the system working how it's designed to work. It wouldn't be so far fetched to say it makes sense to not include those transactions. They amount to a total of $100-ish, in a total reward of 34000$-ish. That's 0.3%. Given the fast propagation nowadays that's higher than the risk of orphaning, but there's still a cost to bigger blocks, and 0.3% isn't much.

I agree, there's better apps than a simple wallet, but that becomes a part of natural progress. If he gets more bitcoin sales, he might go: man, I need to make way to many clicks in this app, I'm going to search for another app specifically for sales. If he gets even more he's going to go: getting out my phone is too time consuming I'm going to leave this tablet here, which is ready to go.
He's probably excepting bitcoin because one guy like us went: man, you need to accept bitcoin, it's this new electronic cash it's super easy, all you need to do is install a wallet app, and you're ready to go.  
And really, he's right. A simple app should be everything you need to start out with. The problem here isn't the extra time to take out your phone and start an app, it's the time it takes because OP is using bad wallet. If OP was using a good wallet, the waiting time was on the merchant, because OP is standing ready to scan and it gets through in 2 seconds max. In that case the merchant might go look for shortening his time. Now the fault is on "bitcoin" in his eyes.
I think the only question that we should take away from this is: how do we get people to not use bitcoin-banks.
edit: IIRC there are cash registers that are bitcoin-ready, most of the time it's just a software update for them. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:42:16
Why would a bank advertise options where they don't earn anything?
You don't make savings using bitcoin, only if the merchant offers it.
I'm missing the part where: " I want to lay out a plan on how we could come closer to a future in which prices are denominated in Bits and therefore Bitcoin functioning as a currency rather than just a payment network in which the currencies get pegged on both ends."
Which is nonsense anyway imo, it is a currency whether or not prices are denominated in it, and you don't just start denominating things in a different currency anyway.

Truth is though that I'm just guessing. I don't know whether a majority of people want the rules to change, I'm just basing myself on the number of people that left or moved.

Abandoning scripts isn't a good option, since further layers rely on those. You're not saving a lot either, 60% of a transaction is signatures, the majority of the rest is the list of in and outputs. 
It's not rocket science to give a higher level idea of what you think should change. You need to give more information than some handwavy "just make things smaller".
"malleability-proof representation" we have that with segwit. "well-defined signatures" as opposed to what?

That's because nobody builds on the orphaned blocks. You just can't call 2 different things the same. I can start building my own chain forked off from some block in 2009, but I can't really call that Bitcoin.  (in a way this already happened with Clams)
There's many ways to make invalid transactions on the legacy chain that are valid on the forked chain. Any transaction using newly minted coins, any transaction that has an UTXO not in the legacy chain (as a result of "double spending" on any of the chains, or as output from an already invalid transaction).

If they want to attach their own printed money, or other assets to some satoshis, they can. For these purposes the bitcoin token is just something in the back and one could say by figure of speech the token isn't of that much use, pretty much as how you could say tcp-ip isn't of that much use for the general public.
If they don't want to care about how things are working and don't want to use bitcoin as the value token, that's just fine, to each their own.

That's not a great nor easy security model imo.
If you have a HD wallet (I don't know if multibit is, HD wallet is one where you'll get a bunch of words as backup), the change addresses won't be a problem.
There are a lot of options to increase security, depending on hardware options, need to access your funds, etc.

I think mining is becoming too centralized, however your explanation doesn't make much sense. You might want to rethink or elaborate on it.
Volatility is a thing, yeah.
You wont lose all your money if it gets banned, but prices will drop significantly, again volatility.
The value of a token will always fluctuate. If it's not, you're trusting 3rd parties, which is fine if you want that, but that's not what bitcoin is all about.
The long addresses will go further and further to the background. First step is QR-codes, but there's things in the make that make it even more easier.

Free markets are free markets because they are allowed to be free markets. Bitcoin isn't inherently free market based (nothing is), governments can force it underground. 
Isn't the logical comparison the financial industry? I could argue centralization of supermarkets is a bad thing, but centralization vs de-centralization wasn't the point I was trying to make.
How can you say centralization is a non-issue, while later stating bitcoin is great because it's not centralized?
You're also saying nation states have shut down cryptocurrencies ( , btw), while later saying China won't hurt bitcoin.
Let's be honest, bitcoin is a threat to nation states, thinking they won't try to control it because some relatively small economical gain is kinda silly.
As we've seen with cryptocurrencies before bitcoin and with p2p applications: if there's a point of failure, governments will attack it. If the majority of mining operations are vested in Asia/China, they can influence the miners in a major way.
I do agree to a certain extend the core developers being few in numbers isn't such a big concern, however there's changes that will influence the future of bitcoin is some way or another. Like the way they're going to solve the scalability issues.
There's also changes miners won't mind. Like extending the block-reward period or increasing blocktimes. This now of course seems ludicrous because 99% of bitcoin users know that's a bad idea, but when it becomes mainstream 99% will have no clue how it really works, just like the monetary system we have now.
Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin and think and hope it will succeed, however I'm scared of this community not being critical enough. I don't want to be the guy in 20 years that says: "Yeah, I was there from the beginning, when users still had a voice. We marveled at the idea, praised anything and anyone that had anything to do with it. We watched it change over time and thought non of it. We stood there, and did nothing."

easier testing, but farmost it's about not delaying other projects and not having to change the segwit code for everything that touches the same code.

Coinbase is like a bank. They (say they) hold bitcoins for you. Exchanges like coinbase are a great on-and-off ramp to get into bitcoin, they're not great for storing your money. 
There's also the issue of usability as with the app you give coinbase an order to send bitcoins, not like with most wallet apps where you send the transactions to the network yourself. Which means that if coinbase has issues or delays, you won't be able to spend anything, or worse, send it twice because the receiver hasn't yet seen the first transaction because of coinbase delays.
If you get worried about hacking, hardware devices are recommended. You can do your own cold storage, but you really have to know what you're doing for that.
Most popular hardware wallets are currently [Trezor]( and [Ledger]( but there are [many out there](
As for mobile wallets: mycellium is pretty popular for android, breadwallet is pretty popular for Iphone.

I didn't know Andreas left before shit hit the fan. He certainly uses his absence to draw attention to the censorship.
Hindsight is indeed 20/20, like I said, I can certainly understand why things happened the way they did. Both the mods and community where probably not ready to handle this well. But I think the RBF thing showed how it should be handled. 
People make it clear in this topic they search for their information elsewhere because they know things here are censored. And maybe they are not censored, we don't know, the rules are unclear. Which brings self-censoring. I've been watching the deleted posts here, not a mention of the hong-kong agreement thing today. Is it that no-one wants to talk about it, or is it because people are scared it will get deleted? I don't know. I also don't know if it will get deleted or not. I also don't know which words I can say and which I can't say without getting picked up by the auto moderator. I don't know how critical I can be before the ordering of my reaction changes.
I've said this somewhere here before: if the sole reason bitcoin isn't forked right now are the actions of a moderator, I fear for the future of bitcoin.

When miners don't accept the transaction it doesn't get into a block. All the power lies with the miners. Full nodes just relay transactions (and validate them, but miners validate transactions too).

People should be informed and educated. While I agree seeing these great minds posting walls of text to some ludicrous idea doesn't feel right, I also recognize they do a way better job than anyone else educating the ignorant. Which might not change the mind of the person with the ludicrous idea, but it stops others from reading it and seeing it for truth.
Ideally that should be our job, as non-developers, to educate ourselfs and others as much as we can about the subject. However too often people are drawn towards "us vs them" and view other opinions as by default inferior. You don't ever see Greg Maxwell talking about "illogical thinkers", "ignorant players" or "brigade of clowns", no matter how silly the accusations are.

This update makes that seeding unnecessary, really.
"Bitcoin Core now uses 'headers-first synchronization'. This means that we first
ask peers for block headers (a total of 27 megabytes, as of December 2014) and
validate those. In a second stage, when the headers have been discovered, we
download the blocks. However, as we already know about the whole chain in
advance, the blocks can be downloaded in parallel from all available peers.
In practice, this means a much faster and more robust synchronization. On
recent hardware with a decent network link, it can be as little as 3 hours
for an initial full synchronization. You may notice a slower progress in the
very first few minutes, when headers are still being fetched and verified, but
it should gain speed afterwards."
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:05:34
You're mistaking the incentives of the miners with that of the government. Miners don't want to blacklist coins, but if their government gives them the option of either stopping their business or to continue with blacklisting, the economic incentives dictate they should start blacklisting. (aka: it's what happens when they don't allow a free market)
The number of full nodes are declining for a long time now, and the real power of the network lies with the miners. 
Read your words. They can't shut it down because it's a network of computers across the entire world... but somehow it's fine if the majority is in 1 country? It's not distributed, it's decentralized and it's consensus-based, which means it's important 50% is not under the control of a single power.

I was just pulling some numbers out to make a point. I'd say even $0.05 is way too much. Why would anyone pay $9 if the merchant will accept $8.95 anyway?
A good app developer will get his price from many sources, as bitcoinaverage might go down or have a bug/get hacked, etc.
There's nothing wrong with requesting a payment. It's how all electronic payments are done. The problem here is just that a once a month event doesn't warrant the setup it needs to make this as quick as it can be. And really, the one to blame here is OP, because if the payment was done with a decent wallet, the payment would've gone through right away and the seller, despite losing some extra time to get his phone out would've likely gotten a more pleasant experience. If any question arises from this is: how to we get people to not use shit-wallets.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it starts from the beginning, with a maximum of 1000 block apart.

Like I replied to someone else here, this wasn't about blacklisting, this was actively deleting this news from whatever source. Yes, ethereum was the reason for the namechange and this news would bring trolls with it. That shouldn't be a reason to ban this news though.
The source of an article shouldn't matter, and neither comments on rhose articles, it's the content that matters. I would totally understand if this was moded without much thought and when mods are made aware of its content revert the action, but bashco stood by the disision.

After a week the dust settled, after 2/3 weeks hardly anyone talked about it.
When Gavin lit the fire into the blocksize debate all hell broke loose indeed. Discussion was heavily censored and people moved to a place where they could circlejerk and develop hatred for anything that is not exactly what they envisioned long time ago. People like Andreas Antonopoulos, who has a great ability to point out the grey in a black vs white discussion, left.

Literally the first point of the first response ever made on the bitcoin mailing-list about this is about not using the softfork bit.
They don't complain, they point out technical shortcomings.
Just because you read on reddit or twitter this "one thing" some developer said doesn't mean that's the only thing he/she said or the only concern. Just the first post in response to bundling a soft &amp; hardfork, which I've opened now anyway now adds to the 'bit' concern: not fixing the sighash issue, poor replay protection, not tweaking the segwit discount, not adding additional commitments for segwit/merged mining/future upgrades, rushed timing, no continues increase, and an overall total disregard of all the hardfork research that has been done in the last years.
I realize you're following the "Core devs are evil" narrative, which is your own choice, fine by me, if there's something wrong or incorrect they're saying, please speak up. But please don't try and convince other people that have no clue with some bogus talk. If you want to rant random stuff, I'd recommend r/btc, posts like this will be upvoted to oblivion.

Not entirely sure I get the question, but in your setup A, B, C and D just have one channel open. They have the same output, just different hashlocks.
You can split the fee 50/50 if you want. (I'm not sure how it's actually implemented) You're still going to have to pay that 50% for each channel, so if you have a lot of channels open, you'll be paying extra fees (however, since you're likely routing more transactions you probably earn some fees from lightning transactions)

I've looked it up and my bank charged 1.5%, $2.79 withdrawal fee.

When people can and do use it.
Now the market is full of traders or small investors who panic at every news article. When you have people actually using it, it'll be much less volatile since the market will have more people with no intend to trade.

It seems like...
*puts on glasses*
... you Fucked Up A Bit
srsly though: keep it, it can go up as fast as it can go down.
One of the key advises about investing: don't invest with money you can't miss. I'm sure this also includes money you don't have.

Given this crash is after the china news, it's just the market reacting to it. It's future worldwide is less certain, thus bitcoin is possibly less worth.
If this was a bubble-burst it would go down more and not after bad news that alters the value.
Do you know the definition of a bubble? I always wonder when people say "it's a bubble!" Why do you think bitcoin is overvalued when you see a market drop after bad news?
