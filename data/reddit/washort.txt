It's valid.

It's valid, it's just signed by CACert.
The fact that your browser thinks it's more dangerous for you to read a blog via HTTPS instead of by unencrypted HTTP should tell you something... :)

wow, AGPLv3? well there's another dead end
@_date: 2012-01-10 23:18:03
Then again, it's a free world, and you shouldn't enable merged mining from the beginning unless you trust every pool operator to be on your side.

"GPLv3 compatible"? You certainly can't use AGPLv3 code in a GPLv3 project, so what do you mean?
By "dead end" I mean that none of his improvements will end up in the main bitcoin implementation unless he relicenses them.
@_date: 2012-01-04 15:54:39
I mean that no one will take any improvements or advances developed in this project and use them in their own (for example, the main Bitcoin implementation).

Right. Bitcoin competes with cash, its properties are a bit different from credit cards. No reason you couldn't have a credit card-like thing denominated in Bitcoin, of course.

Here's another good article on moving beyond the regression theorem:

Bitcoins aren't anonymous. They're pseudonymous.

Oops, he said "inherent value"! Game over.

It already _is_ a real currency. Ask PayPal. ;-)

What? Gold's super easy to divide, both logically and physically. Making an analogy from using gold as money to using bitcoin as money is quite accurate. The problem is the false belief that using gold as money is bad. :)

It's not a question of who *should* accept bitcoin. It's a question of where effort should be spent. If bitcoin becomes useful for accessing services and products not previously possible, other businesses will follow just as a result of the network effect.
That said, I think viewing bitcoin as a useful _money transfer_ system rather than a store of value is probably the best marketing angle right now.
@_date: 2011-05-19 15:42:03
it's money. It's for the things money is for.

People who have expenses in bitcoins coming up.
A more likely scenario at this point is people who know they need to _sell_ bitcoins for some other currency (such as USD) in the future because they have expenses in those currencies but receive bitcoins as part of their business. These people would buy put options as insurance against dips in BTC price in the other currency. Speculators hoping to profit from a rise in price would sell puts - the benefit of selling a put option over just buying BTC directly is that you benefit even if the price stays the same, because you get to keep the payment for the option.

AGPL? do not want

Name some "capitalist economists" who believe that inflation is essential that don't work for the government (or a government-funded school or organization).
@_date: 2011-05-13 20:59:53
There's no way in the system to distinguish between bitcoins that are just being saved and ones that are lost. If they're lost, they're gone for good.
@_date: 2011-05-25 15:05:32
Yes. That's different from saying "the BTC economy can't grow". All you're saying is that the price of BTC in dollars will probably increase (and that is different from deflation, btw).

re enforceability in the US, this is what's on my mind: 
Anyway, AGPL is a license that says to me that you don't want other people to use your code. The extremely unclear meaning of "derivative work" makes it hard to draw any agreed-upon boundaries between AGPL code and anything else a person/organization might deploy on the same site.

There's no reason to believe this. Mildly decreasing prices as aggregate wealth increases don't hurt anybody.

for dinner i'd just pay for it on my gold card. ;-)
seriously though, putting 0.01 oz of gold leaf in a block of lucite is not hard.
@_date: 2011-05-10 04:05:56
how do you do that? cut it into tiny squares? ;-)
@_date: 2011-05-24 19:34:34
Don't confuse currency with wealth. The amount of wealth in an economy can grow regardless of whether the amount of currency can or not.
@_date: 2011-05-09 18:24:08
I agree with your analysis, as bitcoin gains popularity the price will continue to rise. But why's this bad? What problems do you think it will cause? 
(edit: hey reddit, when you say "error 502" when I click post, *don't post*) 
@_date: 2011-11-24 15:13:41
More seriously, though - what was your motivation? (are you aware that the AGPL is probably not enforceable in the US?)
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:07:44
but emotional turmoil and internet drama is so *fun*
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:46:18
pretty much this

just wait, i'm sure we'll have bitcoin-denominated Visa cards any year now.
