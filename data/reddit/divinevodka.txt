I'm not sure where you're getting your information. Go to robinhood website. Click help, then go to crypto- crypto banking. Finally, the second bold. It clearly states that you can withdraw you coins. Furthermore you don't have to withdraw it. I know I trust robinhood more than coinbase. But I probably still would. Please try and not spread misinformation that is clearly easily accessible.
They said that they won't allow you to DEPOSIT. That can change in the future.

Actually the first two are already up and running. It's only for high end gold users ATM hough. It's still in beta, but you really do have some users who are using it.

You're being so ridiculous right now. You are now arguing the analogy I put forth. That's a common tactic when someone has no argument. Shut down the analogy. Call it bad, THEN prove your point. It's a bit sad that people like you are in the community. It will only force new comers away. Hopefully your "argument"(if we can call it one).. will be downvoted always. 
Thanks for the attempt.

Stop being silly. Do you want to prosecute people who sell guns? Or people who use them to kill?

You're not. That's petty much exactly what's coming. You stake in a pool, get Ether in return. No more mining. That's pretty far off though, hope for 2018.

Uh... Crypto kitties is a good thing for ethereum. No, not the crazy amount of transactions that held the network up. That sucked! The idea behind it. I don't want to sit here typing away to be called a shill. Instead I urge you to educate yourself on its road map before writing it off. The only reason why I say this, is because if you can be invested in btc. You really have no argument to not be invested in ethereum or, at least read up on it properly. Why? Because Bitcoin is very far away from what it intended(doesn't mean I hate it. This thing gave me good returns so far). Yet it's right here. So the question then is, why on earth do you have investments in it?
If you're going to point out fundamentals as to why ethereum is a mess. Then think about Bitcoins current state. Again, no, I like it. In fact it's my most holdings. Simply because it gives good returns.

How about opening a new back account. Placing the envelope inside the box, and with an instruction no one else is allowed to go in. Not even your wife(is that even allowed). The point is I think that would be safer than the envelope at work.

I agree when good folks go out of their way to explain it to me a newbie...  It's kind of overwhelming. Start slow and build up I would say
