why did you use WU? a regular bank would have done it for a fraction of it

thats actually not bad. Is still way better than most securities investment. I own some funds that the commission every time i liquidate is about $80, and my current portfolio has an "especial rate" of 4.95 for entry trades and similar for exit trades. So 0.30 for a transaction seems reasonable as long as is not an everyday currency

congratulations on your success! you were a true visionary. I would strongly suggest against casino all the position at once. 
If you cash the position while being an US tax resident you will be liable for a capital gains tax on your bitcoin asset. I would advise you move abroad to a country where bitcoin is not regulated or not considered an asset (south america), you might find it more profitable that way
