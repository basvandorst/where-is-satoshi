Can someone ELI5 how this is more secure than a centralized method since tickets can easily have a "private key" that can be scanned to verify they are not counterfeit?
Why piggy-back on the blockchain for something like this other than offloading their costs onto Bitcoin?

I guess it could be useful in cases where you would need a trusted 3rd party to verify a transaction/contract happened. Anything you would want a irrefutable receipt for.
In terms of something like a car/house key though, I don't think this would be helpful. Maybe in combination with biometric security - and even then, it would be better to be an "offline"/"self-contained" system like Apple ID.
Definitely interesting.

The centillion effect is with regards to money supply. I'm going to guess you mean that currencies will always inflate in the long-term if you increase the money supply in the long-term? I don't disagree with that statement, but it's not exactly what the debate has been about.
Also if you believe a long-term inflationary and a long-term deflationary currency is possible, it follows that a long-term constant currency is also possible. However, the best mechanism to achieve these goals is of course debatable. I am more interested in the potential economic outcome of each possibility as the topic of this discussion, rather than an exact method of achieving inflation/deflation/constant in the long-term.
Also I don't know about guaranteed, so I would say that's another topic up for a separate debate.

ApplePay does actually solve the original problem of CC information being stolen, and the second problem of poor verification when CC are added is a bank problem - NOT an ApplePay problem.
Also, relevance of this article is seriously a stretch.

If bitcoin had a value of $10 it would need to have INCREDIBLE velocity (each bitcoin would need to be transferred much more frequently between parties) for it to have enough transaction value to be worthwhile for big retailers/participants.
Or in other words: if the market cap of bitcoin was 1/30 of what it was today, bitcoins would need to be transferred 30x more frequently for them to represent the same amount of value being transferred today - which is needed to keep all the current market participants interested.
However, at the rate the price is currently dropping, I doubt velocity would be able to keep up.

Yeah I think when mild and stable, neither is a major problem since +/- 1% does very little to change behaviour in comparison to underlying economic forces.
You see a lot of the more vocal critics here (on either side of the debate) point to hyper-inflation or deflationary spirals to make their arguments, but very little discussion on the more important middle ground (i.e. 1-2% long-term inflation, 1-2% long-term deflation).
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:26:15
That is an interesting point. Hiding "real growth" under broader currency inflation does have it's own downsides.

Thanks that's interesting.

I certainly agree it would be a very difficult task in the short-term and near impossible to do in real time, however in the long run it is certainly possible. The current central bank system has managed reasonably well keeping inflation within 1-2% of their targets despite many external factors (including other central banks and even fiscal policy working against them at times).
I think I am more interested in the potential economic outcome of each possibility as the topic of this discussion, rather than an exact method of achieving inflation/deflation/constant in the long-term.
Edit: fixed some wording.

As a percentage of their income, people who already in the top 1% can save way more than a poor person. So when they get their pay cheque, a huge chunk of it will just continue to increase in purchasing power with absolutely no work on their part (versus forcing them to invest wisely to fight inflation).
For the bottom 90% however, only a small chunk of their pay cheque will benefit from this effect, since they are forced to spend a bigger portion of it.
So what I was trying to say is although they will both benefit from increasing purchasing power, the people who are already rich early will disproportionately benefit from it. 
If it isn't entirely clear why I am saying that, think of it like your wealth is your portfolio: since a poor person needs most their portfolio invested in living expenses (a.k.a living pay cheque to pay cheque), only a small amount of their portfolio will have access to that benefit. As for the wealthy, it is the other way round. Most of their "portfolio" can enjoy that benefit as only a small portion is allocated to living expense. So when you compare the two portfolios, although they both made money on their currency investment the wealthy person's portfolio made more (in terms of overall % gain) than the poor person's portfolio. So the wealth gap expands more rapidly.
As for "spending in the hopes it will raise in value", turn that into "saving in the hopes it will raise in value" for Bitcoin. You can't believe in one without the other as they are physiologically caused by the same human instinct. 
On a side note, just for the sake of debate, wouldn't a universal currency with near constant purchasing power be the better middle ground? It would create a system where the medium of exchange and store of value *in itself* would have **no net impact** on the function of the economy. I think this should be the ultimate goal, however I see no easy way to get there.
[Edit: I would also like to add I am NOT a proponent of the current currency system, as it places trust in the judgement of a few people who can sometimes make terrible decisions and cause irreversible harm to entire populations and is ripe with corruption and manipulation. Although I will admit, when these interventions are well thought out, they can also be beneficial to entire populations. It would just be better to do away with hit-and-miss systems for something as important as currencies.]

Guess those down votes were reversed since then?
Anyways, I am not talking about a doomsday scenario of the top 1% of Bitcoin holders never spending their coins. I'm talking more about people who are able to save larger portions of their wealth in Bitcoin versus people who have immediate need for that wealth to cover their living expenses. The former group will benefit more from the rising purchasing power than the later group, net-net (i.e. even though they both have increasing purchasing power, the later group only experiences it on a small portion of their overall wealth)
Also, from [my other response](

You can always make good money on the stock market in the long run since companies are productive assets in the end of the day. They have cashflows, and those cashflows can be valued. Look for the fairly valued ones and 10-15% per year is mearly a matter of patience and discipline. 
Personally I only invest in S&amp;P500 companies (stocks and long term options) and I am quite happy with my returns.

We will likely get our first set of good numbers today with Apple's Q4 earnings release.
All available data so far points to a couple million sign-ups, with good follow up in terms of repeat usage. Bank and retail location adoption continues to expand, so it's still very early days.

As much as I am pro-bitcoin the technology, I have to point out that a permanently deflating currency is a serious problem for wealth inequality. It essentially rewards the rich for being rich (even MORE so than we do today), widening the relative wealth gap between people who can afford to save and people who can't.
The earlier you acquired your wealth the better off you will be - FOREVER. It continues to grow in purchasing power with no work on your part.
On the other hand, people with low incomes who can't afford to save any significant amount of their income will never benefit from this effect.
So net-net the gap between people who are already wealthy and the people who aren't will expand much more rapidly. As it is this is a serious problem, e.g. in the [US](

The "bans" only activate if a node is full, so if ALL NODES on the ENTIRE BITCOIN network are being DDOS-ed to capacity - then YES this code would ban everyone on the blacklist from the network until their is excess network capacity again.

Trying to use the "blacklist" to "ban" someone from the entire network would never work. All it does is make it much harder for blacklisted IP addresses to DDOS nodes, because they will have a low priority and will be bumped from a FULL node if the node reaches 100% capacity.
Right now the "blacklisted" TOR IP addresses are scraped from a publicly available list of exit nodes.
Hope that explains it a bit more clearly :)

Trojan? ALL this information is available on the [XT website]( And on the FAQ page!
What we are seeing right now is FUD trying to spin an anti-DDOS mechanism into some doomsday ban-list - which it is NOT, since it is ONLY triggered under circumstances where nodes are full to capacity and cannot accept more connections (i.e. under attack). 
So long as their is even a single node with capacity available for new connections, NO ONE is "banned".

The network doesn't "know it", only individual nodes know that they have reached capacity and can't accept new connections - THAT is when the code is triggered.
So ONLY if ALL nodes are at maximum capacity and can't accept new connections, THEN will a "blacklisted" IP address actually be locked out of the network entirely. But as soon as a single node is able to accept a new connection (e.g. attack has stopped) then ANYONE (including someone on the "blacklist") can connect to the network again. 
So trying to use the "blacklist" to "ban" someone from the entire network would never work. All it does is make it much harder for blacklisted IP addresses to DDOS nodes, because they will have a low priority and will be bumped from the node if the node reaches 100% capacity.
Hope that explains it a bit more clearly.

Just takes one mistake. There is no harm in gathering as much information as possible. If anything it will better prepare us for future attacks.
There is also information/advice available on what can be done to stop/mitigate attacks.
