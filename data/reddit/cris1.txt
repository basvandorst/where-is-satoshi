Mining does not seem to be profitable anymore due to the lack of power in computer hardware. Places like MtGox and BitStamp allow you to buy bitcoins for USD/EUR/GBP.

Yeah 0.0001

Where does this take bitcoin now?
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:48:40
Is it going to crash first though?

Looks like some people just lost or forgot wallets with thousands in. I guess that's the danger now the value of coins are going up.
@_date: 2013-01-23 17:33:35
I will give that a shot as soon as I get paid.

It says its unconfirmed on there as well

Thanks, I was to poor to pay 0.0005. I have just been milking the faucets so far. I am waiting for the price to drop before I buy some.

I've seen this around and it looks pretty cool. Would you ship to the UK?

I presume this must be in the same browser though.

One must be an FBI wallet I guess from coins they seized from the Silk Road Bust.

I just used them and it was great. Got my coins really quickly.
