They are your opponent whether you like it or not and the only way to beat them is to have better tech and ideas.

As far I read anyway Graphene claims to use bloom filters along with another form of compression to transmit data needed to build a block from the mempool (on the receiving node) with out transmitting all the transaction data. Very cool if it works but not really relevant to the debatable differences between BCH and BTC which like i said I can't debate on this sub.

ah.. ok so it does work like BTC then. Invoice (unique address) gets paid so it doesn't matter who paid it.

Can you create random addresses on your LN receiver wallet so that if the sender sends money to that address you can validate the money you received was from the person you expect? I'm just trying to understand how merchants will be able to adopt it.

So there is no reliable way to know who sent you money? How can merchants use this? In BTC you create a unique address and give that to the party you expect payment from. Once payment is received to that address you know they paid you.

They got rid of RBF because it breaks the ability to utilize 0-conf transactions.

I think there will be a bitcoin mars and bitcoin earth with miners on each working respectively on their own chains. You will convert one to the other when traveling or making purchases like you do when traveling from one country to another. There is no way any crypto (currently) that is mined will over come the signal delay between planetary long distances. They solve the problem of intercontinental money but not interplanetary just yet.

My bank charged high fees so I switched to a credit union. BTC charged high fees so I switched to BCH. Its that simple.

As generic as possible what he is saying is that higher fees will encourage users to adopt a method (segwit) that has lowers fees. 
What is the end result of an equation that follows that rule? 
What do you think would be the correct sentence to follow if I said "segwit transactions have a higher fee than bitcoin cash"? 
You would say "Higher fees will incentivize adoption (of BCH) eventually"

I want you to think about what you just said. Think long. Think hard.

BTC and BCH are not completely different currencies. They function the same, are easily be converted from to the other and spend at nearly all the same places.
