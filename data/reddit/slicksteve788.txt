That is not frivolous filing.  Frivolous filing would be if he/she intentionally reported inaccurate numbers.  The documentation must show that his/her numbers are accurate, but there is no specification on how records must be kept as long as they are accurate and reliable.

No it's similar to taking a fraudulent position but lacking the severity to constitute harsh punishment. It's a frivolous position in reporting, not record keeping. The only other way it's frivolous is if the IRS can prove you are intentionally impeding their ability to levy taxes. Good luck proving that extreme record keeping is impeding the IRS.
Also, I'm not advising that anyone do anything in this thread, frankly I don't care how you keep your records and neither does the IRS. If you think it's a good idea to piss off your auditor, more power to you, but it's not illegal to keep stacks of pages detailing the value of each of your transactions as required in the code. So don't go fear mongering saying people can go to jail for following the law.

First let's be very clear here, I never "suggested" anyone file anything in any manner.  I "suggest" that everyone file their taxes in the most accurate manner possible to avoid penalties.  However, it is not a frivolous position to simply over or understate income or deductions as long as it is done in good faith.  Fines are assessed in tax court and must be proven to be intentional and severe enough to justify frivolous filing or fraudulent filing.
Less than .01% of the population is charged with crimes in tax court in a given year.  These are not frequent charges and only occur in severe cases as I've said multiple times.  Auditors know and expect a few mistakes on a return, it has to be excessive to even constitute frivolity much less fraudulence.
