Thank you so much for your answer. I know this post must be pretty frustrating because i know so little about this. I actually have free electricity (included in my monthly rent).

Even if bitcoins should fail it is what it symbolizes that intrigues me most. It kind of symbolizes a new era, and should it fail other similar currency/means of transaction will take it's place. 
It's kind of like software piracy. Lots of people love it, lots of people hate it. Big media corporations hate it. Even if you don't like it, it's here to stay. Battling piracy is like trying to put out a forest fire by peeing on it; it may delay the fire for a bit but if you don't move and find a new place you will get caught in the flames. The same is true for bitcoin. 
Current transaction services and institutions like banks, Paypal, VISA may not like bitcoin (and the likes of it) but it's here to stay. What will determine if bitcoin will be a success or not is if it gets accepted as acurrency by people and companies. And like i said even if bitcoin fails, other services similar to it will rise. It's too late to pee on it now.

I'm currently using GUIminer to mine to my blockchain wallet with 123 Mhash/s. This is probably not very good at all but i'm just excited that i's up and running! I'm doing this just to learn about bitcoins and not to earn money. Thank you all for your help.

OK i just have to say this: WOW. I am a total rookie when it comes to bitcoins and bitcoin mining. I sort of expected to get shot down for asking stupid questions but you guys are all helpful and nice. I wish all of reddit was like this. Thank you all for your answers.
