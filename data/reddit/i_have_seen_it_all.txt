the Japanese problem is actually very easy to solve.
it's like this. let's say you're trying to buy a private island. you go to the government and say, i'll give you $100, will you sell me that island? and they say no. so you say, i'll give you $1000, will you sell me that island? and they say no. so you say, I'll give you $10,000 will you sell me that island? and they say no.
that's insanity, to get different results, you need to go to $1,000,000, maybe $10,000,000, maybe $300,000,000.
Japan's throwing $100s at a private island problem.
they need to go all the way.
Bernanke studied the Japan problem and studied the Great Depression problem. That's where he got his helicopter idea. And yet here they all are, being too timid, throwing $100 at a private island problem.
edit: actually Japan's BoE, and the US Fed has already asked the government/Congress for help. the Bernanke literally said a helicopter drop of money will help. The Fed does NOT have the mandate to send money directly to main street. All they are legally allowed to do is to buy US Treasuries on the open market as a way of sending money to the banks (who are the dealers in the UST market), and hope that the banks will send the money down to small businesses through business loans, working capital loans etc. This is not happening because at the same time government policy and financial regulation is forcing banks to shore up more capital to reduce risk on their balance sheet, so all the money gets stuck somewhere backing loans.
what we need to kickstart the economy back to the 2005-2007 heydays is to increase risk taking and encourage reckless and profligate spending (especially by property speculators).

Nope. Wrong.  The moment Japan started the zirp and app in 2008 the economy finally got kicking in spite of the backdrop of the gfc - increased cpi increased consumer spending. There are a million reasons why monetary policy in the real world keep giving immediate results, why when money becomes too scarce and too expensive for consumers and businesses to spend, making money cheaper stops the economy from sputtering.

if the economy is not growing, yes then more dollars are chasing less goods.
this might have been true between 2008-2011.
but right now, i don't think so. you genuinely need money to support the economy. if you have a economy that is fighting to grow, and not enough money circulating to support that growth... that's basically Japan's lost decade.
in any case, there is also monetary inflation in bitcoin, since supply is going to keep increasing for another 150 years

securities is called securities because you put your signature on a deed and that secures your ownership over the asset.
finance and financial law are social constructs that has transcended several eras of history. a lot of the words that are used back are still used today even if the colloquial meaning has changed significantly.
another one that trips people up massively is the phrase 'going concern', which means a viable business (and not mistakenly "business risk"), that takes its meaning from the old meanings of going, 'ongoing, continuing', and concern, to mean a particular arrangement of economic entities under a combined management.

now here's the funny thing.
imagine you are a financial regulator. someone tips off the office that some shenanigans is happening at a major company. you have investments in the company (among 100s of other investments) as part of your retirement plan. your manager tells you the team needs to investigate the tip off. and you, as part of the team, need to dump your holdings in this company in order to ensure 0% conflict of interest. so you do.
one year later, the team concludes the investigation and finds serious regulatory violations by the company. the stock collapses. was your sales insider trading?
now imagine that the investigation concluded and the tip-off was made by a competitor who wanted to sabotage a rival company. the company under investigation is above water and has keeps accurate and meaningful records of all its activities. the company's stock, which you sold, rose 15% over the investigation period due to good financial results and the clean bill of health from the regulator. was your sales insider trading?

the reason why some banks (GS) are selling bitcoin investment advice and services and some banks (BAML) are not is because of regulatory uncertainty.
The banks that don't want to sell bitcoin services basically think "we don't know what the SEC and FinCEN will do to us", so they don't sell bitcoin services.
And the banks that do think: "we know what the SEC and FinCEN will do to us... because we *tell them* what to do to us"
it's all a matter of how many tentacles they have up the regulator's ass. it's how far the company thinks they can test the limits of regulation.

I think this is the right answer and not the top comment currently about the exchange triggering stops.. Well they could but this outcome is quite a bit more serious than stops being triggered for a handful of traders. I am inclined to think there are more incompetent and honest people in the world than smart and dishonest ones.I can't imagine it being a good idea to have only a single margining level though. Typically in margining you have an initial margin much higher than a maintenance margin and trader account will freeze and will eventually stop out once he depletes the initial. So the maintenance is there to cover worsening losses if the stop suffers slippage.... Not this amateur hour business where the initial margin is max liability when one side of the futures trade gets stopped out.

If you’re invested in the tech you’d be in coinbase bitmex binance etc. You should be throwing money at the people aggressively getting lay people to buy and spend bitcoin.
I’m fully invested in bitcoin... specifically I’m all in on the tech that allows me to spend freely. I’m nearly flat in bitcoin. I’m spending it all the time. I’m moving it around. I’m selling as much as I’m buying. If I have nothing to spend on I won’t hoard bitcoin. It should be for everyone to participate in.
That’s my philosophy. Those of you hoarding, artificially limiting supply to prop up prices... it’s like a curse on bitcoin. Bitcoin should be cheap to buy and cheap to spend. That’s the end game.

the one major thing that will allow bitcoin to replace fiat is "promissory bitcoin".
that is, bitcoin that people promise to pay you in the future. and that promise can be bought and sold.
think about how the world works. all the way down to the very fundamentals of human cooperation.
let's say, there is a textile manufacturer. it tells the rich man of the town I need some bitcoin to start growing some cotton, I'll owe you for a year. the rich man says I don't have bitcoin right now because it's elsewhere. here have some paper I signed. the paper simply says, "THIS CONFERS THE VALUE OF 1 BITCOIN TO THE BEARER OF THE PAPER SIGNED, THE RICH MAN." 
you make clothes. in order to make clothes you buy cloth from a textiles manufacturer. it takes you a few weeks to make clothes. then you sell the clothes to a clothes shop.
the textile manufacturer says, pay me in bitcoins. you tell the textile manufacturer, i'll pay you when i make the clothes and sell it to the clothes shop, in three weeks.
the textile manufacturer says fine.
you make the clothes and bring it to the clothes shop. you tell the shop, pay me in bitcoins. the shop says, I'll pay you when the people come into the shop and buy my clothes, in three weeks.
you say fine.
the people working for the textile manufacturer gets paid. the manufacturer tells its employees, i have no coins, but have some bitcoin promises from the rich man of the town. take these promises of bitcoin. you can use them anywhere. They bring the rich man paper to the clothes shop to buy some fancy new clothes to celebrate.
the clothes shop takes the bitcoin paper and pays you. you pay the bitcoin paper to the textile manufacturer. the textile manufacturer gives the rich man back his paper. the rich man of the town charged the textile manufacturer some interest and earned a little bit. the textile manufacturer earned a bit of profit growing cotton. you earned a bit of money making clothes. the shop earned a bit of money selling clothes. and the people earned a bit of money working for the manufacturer.
everyone gets paid, and new clothes were made for people to wear. good times are had by everyone.
where does the "promise of bitcoin" come from? it's not bitcoin. but there must be a community effort to accept 
"promises" across the entire economy. these promises must be underwritten and community must accept that there are powers who will work to enforce these promises.
only when such a thing happens, will bitcoin become the currency of the future.
because when it doesn't happen, this is what happens:
the textile manufacturer goes to a rich man and says can I borrow some bitcoin, I would like to make cloth. 
the rich man says i'm sorry, all my bitcoin is tied up in my company. i don't have any to give to you. maybe in a year.
the textile manufacturer does not make cloth. the clothing manufacture does not make shirts. the fashion shop does not sell shirts. the workers of the textile manufacturer does not buy anything.
the community continues to wear ratty shirts because nobody is capable of making new ones. in addition no one gets paid and no one can afford much.

I have no idea what you are trying to say with "rehypothecation".
rehypothecation is a very specific activity where you are a customer/client of a brokerage and you intend to trade in a margin account, and so the brokerage, by nature of it not being a bank and therefore unable to lend any money, will use the securities that you traded in your margin account as collateral to borrow from a bank the funds needed for your margin trade. so the collateral changes hands with three parties instead of the usual two (hypothecation). the act of the brokerage using your assets to borrow money from a bank to finance your trades is rehypothecation.

Typically the person initiating a large transaction pays a premium for executing the trade. If you want to do an otc block sell to a dealer for example you might sell couple of ticks worse than market. There are no economies of scale to block trades. By wanting to execute a large trade you add more (buying or selling) pressure to the market without any change in supply on the other side. the difficulty and price uncertainty of unwinding a large trade imposes a cost on large trades which the aggressor/initiator will pay. It doesn't matter that the trade was done otc the impact will manifest on screens.

I'm not sure how an aggregate bid is going to work. If b1 bids 650 and b2 bids 600 for an aggregate 625 bid, and if the winning bid is 640, is b1 entitled to his share? He bid higher than the winning bid after all, even if secondmarket did not win the bid. And if he's then not entitled to the bid just because other bidders aren't aggressive enough, what's the point of b1 participating in the bid?Since secondmarket does not seem to be doing this aggregate bid as a proper syndicate bid with the usms (seeing that aggregate bidders are not revealed to the usms) then it looks like second market simply wants to achieve a purchase at a fair price while looking for ready buyers to offload a decent part of its risk at a quick and easy profit for itself.

your tone suggests that you think this activity is immoral.
i would put it to you that such an activity is simply neutral. actions performed by humans are merely actions. if manipulation is influences the price one way, then any action to prevent manipulation influences the price the other. both manipulation and non-manipulation will influence bitcoin. and not everyone agrees that the price of bitcoin must be one way or the other. hence no morality can be prescribed to it. bitcoin, and all the actions related to it, simply *are* (be, is, was, had been, will be ... etre, sont, etaient, seront, seraient) according to the system it is designed for.
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:16:46
I think bitcoin has a bit of ways to go before banks start to consider taking it on as a significant revenue product.
one of the problems of bitcoin is the lack of lending markets. the fact that bitcoin is decentralized is contributing to this issue. there is no real middleman standing between borrowers and lenders. if you were to borrow from the bank, the bank is willing to take the risk of you not returning the money. if you were to lend to the bank (through a deposit for example), the bank is willing to take the risk of you suddenly withdrawing a lot of money while it is using your money to lend to a borrower. and if the bank is suddenly hit by a shortfall of cash, the bank can always go to a repo market to make up for the additional cash (inflow or outflow), and the repo market is cleared by a handful of major instis like BoNY or JPM, and again these instis are backed by the Fed.
so we don't have that in bitcoin. if you were to borrow in bitcoin, as you can see from bitfinex that you need to find someone willing to agree to the same rate, tenor, and other conditions of borrowing/lending as you. that's difficult. in the traditional economy, a bank will stand in between and match the two with its own balance sheet, taking on the difficulty of matching borrowers' and lenders' different requirements.
so one really good way of getting bitcoin to the next level as a currency is to centralize bitcoin, by having a middleman (or a few) stand as a risk taker to both borrowers and lenders. the payment technology itself may not be centralizable, but the creation of perhaps a bitcoin-deliverable contract which can be created out of thin air, transferred, or novated will be definitely be beneficial to bitcoin. in doing so, it will also allow the size of the (notional) bitcoin economy to grow past the 21m bitcoin limit that bitcoin will eventually hit within the next half a century.

even if he uses cash, he does not have access to the 2% fees that the merchant saves, so while it exists, it has zero impact on the OP. if he pays with bitcoin or cash, he will continue paying the same increased prices that the merchant may or may not have imposed to cover cc fees.

I know there are sometimes discounts on bitcoin purchases, but rarely are there cash discounts simply because of the fees. in fact, I am not certain that visa/mastercard allows that kind of discounting if a merchant chooses to sign up with them.
edit: reading your other comments I think you mean that if the merchant no longer accepts cc, then the merchant no longer has to pay the fees and he can charge the OP 2% less. That is one way, but that is, like above, not within the OP's control.

china has an amazing ability to shut down unapproved content on the internet. an extreme hypothetical would be a country whose internet providers are all government run and an internet service that only has access to national content. internet services are already government controlled in china. an army of internet content reviewers shut down unapproved content fairly quickly. just a few days ago china, instead of blocking specific websites decided to simply block entire global data centres. in north korea there is no connection to the external world. in Thailand censorship and political groups crawl the internet for lese majeste offenders, those caught are locked away without trial.
internet censorship is entirely possible, it's just a matter of how far a country is willing to take it to.

Nice. Several months ago I wrote here about the need for derivative contracts that may not be physically deliverable in order to vastly expand the amount of notional bitcoin in the economy in order to support growing economic activity that are bitcoin based. The ability to leverage bitcoin positions both buy and sell positions without fully funding is definitely a good thing. The use of promissory bitcoin falls in line with economic reality due to the lead time between the cashflow effects of acquiring and selling inventory. Similar to how the use of cash settled synthetic forwards and swaps have replaced actual ownership of assets, this development could expand the supply of (notional) bitcoin well beyond the 21m hard cap without requiring a fork.

I wonder how they would do it, if they did.
quite a few equity funds use cash settled swaps of some kind to avoid having to manage underlying physical positions and the dealers/mkt makers likewise if they have enough netting positions among its clients can simply hold a fractional amount of the underlying too and simply pass the loss from one fund to make up the profit of another. so simply betting on the price of an instrument without having to trade the instrument.
if fortress gets into it, this should drive the ability to use bitcoin as a financial instrument that is capable of being borrowed and lent, which is necessary for building further derivative contracts and expanding the supply of notional bitcoin well beyond the 21million that is far too little to support the modern economic engine.

although he is downvoted, he is right: in most countries the regulators adopt auditing standards and appoints (quasi-independent) third party boards to develop and oversee the standards. the auditing firms then follow the standards. if a company intends to be a public company, then it must make its financial reporting public under a statutorily required standard of accounting and standard of auditing (such in the US, the GAAP and GAAS). even if a company is privately held, if it intends to provide financial services, financial statements (that are prepared according to statutory requirements) must be provided to clients when asked.
statutory law and accounting/auditing are rarely completely separate issues.
having unregulated auditing activities is what happened with Enron, Arthur-Andersen, and the resulting Sarbanes-Oxley act.

Generally, global companies tend not to keep currency as investment due to generous hedge accounting benefits.

there are a lot of people (like those working in insti trading side of the banks) who are great salespeople: they regularly find fantastic trade ideas, great at talking it up, really friendly, committed, intense folks who will work through the night to make sure their client's trades are fully taken care of, and they make a lot of money being in sales (and I mean a lot).
but the moment they trade for themselves, when it comes down to their own money... it's great that their brains are screwed on the right way, they know when they're wrong and when they are right, but their hearts are telling them to do the exact opposite of their minds. 
in short, they have all the brains and none of the temperament.

Income tax
You pay the community for the set up of the legal framework on which you are able to agree to be  paid in return for your effort, for a community arbitrator (I.e the courts) to ensure enforcement of this agreement, to manage disputes, to ensure that your employer furnished a safe place for you to earn a living and to enforce and punish if not the case.
You pay the community for legal services to ensure clients pay for your organizations' services and goods rendered, to organise and provide physical space for you to store your factories, offices, display your goods, and to establish roads or communication networks for your customers to reach you and to trade with you.
You pay the community for protection of your right to your own living space, for fire and crime protection, to organise and partition living space and commercial space to ensure peace and quiet and appropriate land use for everyone. And for a legal system to protect your claim to such a space.
You pay the community for the protection of your ownership, to lay a legitimate claim to your own assets, to support the communitys effort to ensure owners are paid their fair share while ensuring that employees, clients, and suppliers stake in your investments are also taken care of through various means, and to support community's effort to promote business and economic growth through trade deals, economic incentives, tax rebates, so that consumption and sales can grow and your investments can prosper.
Inheritance 
Taxes also serve another purpose to discourage negative behaviour. Here taxes discourage hoarding.
I think there is a possibility of a self organizing system, perhaps like anarcho cap, wherein people are free to associate themselves with whichever community they feel best meet their needs, or to set up their own community that works towards their own betterment in their own values. Each community's ability to work with each other relies on some level of trust but also some balance of power in the matter of dispute resolution enforcement when things go sour. In such unfortunate cases it is likely the larger community has bargaining power but perhaps opting for the lack of bargaining power in the world is desirable for some people and we should allow people to handicap themselves by going with a small community if they insist on doing so.

For these questions it helps to read the contract specifications and also delve a little bit into cmes settlement processes.
The simplified process is: at the expiry of the futures contract if you have a long position in the contract you will be paid the difference between the price you paid for the contract and the final settlement price. And if you are short you will pay the difference. The final settlement price is determined by cme and the exact calculation of the value is in the PDF below:
The reference rate is a contribution by member exchanges iirc bitstamp itbit kraken gdax and the daily reference rate is an average traded price between 3-4pm London time every day. the actual calculation is a fixed formula that is highly visible to all cash exchange participants.
So you cannot simply trade the futures as if it has no relation to the underlying. For example, you can try to pump up the futures until it’s $10k, and if at the expiry of the contract actual bitcoin settles at $8k, you’ll be asked to cough up the balance $2k even if it is in cash. Conversely if you are trying to arb the difference, you can buy actual bitcoin for $8k, sell the futures for $10k and when the futures go into delivery you sell your actual bitcoins into the settlement window targeting cme’s formula and stop the cash outlay into the futures. So the underlying price movement is going to influence arbitrageurs to knock the futures price back in line. 
Now the cme don’t really give a crap (well not totally) about the actual price action of bitcoin futures. You can choose to short it all the way down to $6k if you want. At the end of the day everyone else will expect cme to apply the daily settlement price, the cme will apply the daily settlement price, and if you are short 10k in bitcoins @ $6k you’ll be asked to put up $10m in margin when bitcoin settles end of day

The settlement price (price at which all Long and short interests settle with each other) is a weighted average price of trades done between 3 and 4 pm London on several exchanges: gdax, itbit kraken etc. The formula for the average price can be found on a reference paper that is linked to from cme’s website. Cme does not set its own bitcoin price.

it wasn't so much that governments were eager to seize control than it was that the people were eager to have a single organization manage the disparate value of commercial paper issued by banks across town.
remember, the bank note was only as good as the credit of the members who are issued and rely on the bank notes. every bank claims a unique advantage in its ability to identify and discriminate high quality creditors and to ensure only those are allowed to participate in its bank notes. countless bank failures eventually led to a consolidation. this is pure mathematics: the single risk of the sum of two banks cannot be worse than the sum of separate risks of two banks. it is no different from the consolidation that occurred over the 2011 GFC. by the end of the worst of it, several hundred banks shuttered, nearly all of them tiny regional banks. the ones that survived the best were the large supermarket banks that did everything and covered everyone - citibank, bofa, chase. the specialist banks - lehman, bear stearns - didn't have enough diversification in their client and business revenue streams to survive the carnage. since the nationalization of credit to today, several important developments in financial markets - interbank lending, the discount window, overnight lending, and collateralized repo all contributed to further stability in day to day funding across all banks managing economic activity in disparate regions throughout the country.
money as a tool for approximating value was still nowhere near as useful as its ability today to hold promissories for future requirements. in the beginning, economic value was specific to time and place, if you had crop to sell at the harvest six months from now, they would have no value today. but being able to convince a bank to issue a note on your harvest and to give you the money to pay for fertilizer and water and farm hands today would give you a fighting chance at ensuring your goods will be ready at harvest.

company A says no sale then. company B says your loss. company A then loses out on a 100 btc sale.

company A is going to say, why don't you pay me back in 30 days. company A writes an invoice, the 100 btc sale becomes a... loan.

employee says, fuck you, bitcoin or nothing. company A says, ok nothing then. you don't get paid.
haha that's not going to happen.
employee is going to say, fuck you. but give me my BBitcoin anyway. he then goes to Bitcoin Bank to exchange BB for bitcoins, then to company B's supermarket to buy his weekly groceries with his bitcoin, and company B takes the bitcoin that they get from selling all their shit, and uses that to pay company A, who then redeems all their BBitcoin loans with real bitcoin.

you do not understand that the vast majority of people do not deserve to use bitcoin.
when bitcoin becomes the currency of the world. the rest of the world, the fools, will be systematically deprived of economic nourishment - they will simply starve, die, wither away and become irrelevant. we, the new world order, will usurp the establishment and take the place as the kings of the new world.
they do not know but their extinction is only years away.

and? is that a relevant point? it's not a prize that was given out at the beginning but it is a Nobel prize, legitimized by the Nobel foundation and given out by the same group of people that gives out the physics and chemistry prizes. the nobel foundation and the nobel committee continues to promote the economics prize as one of the many prizes that they give out and they continue to recognize economics prize winners as Nobel prize winners.
the bank donated to the foundation, the foundation gives out the prizes. the bank does not involve itself in the selection of the prize winners because the foundation gives out the prizes. the prize winners are selected by the same organization that selects the physics prize. if the economics prize is illegitimate, so is the physics prize. maybe you don't agree with the physics prize, but that's your opinion, not the foundation's. oh by the way, did i already say the foundation gives out the prizes? because the foundation gives out the prizes.
edit: by the way the nobel family is connected to the current nobel foundation in name and legacy only. what the family thinks of the current prizes is irrelevant to the world. the nobel family is attempting to give out prizes for energy discovery and the nobel foundation is threatening legal action against the nobel family for misusing the "Nobel" name for prize giving. the nobel family has no authority over the nobel name anymore and their opinion on the economics prize can be safely ignored.
also in case you missed it, the foundation gives out the prizes.
If you can’t understand that all, read the links I posted. It’s all in there.

lol this may-may again.
so wroooong.
the nobel prize in economics is chosen by the nobel committee, is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences together with the physics and the chemistry prizes, the award is given out at the same ceremony as every other nobel prize, the [nobel foundation recognizes the economics prize as one of their own prizes](
krugman has definitely won a Nobel prize. oh look! [here he is on the nobel website as one of the nobel prize winners!]( ��

no this is wrong.
it goes by a different name but the nobel committee definitely awards the prize for economics, at the same award ceremony, together with all the other original nobel prizes. for all intents and purposes it is a nobel prize.
here's a link to the official website: 
the nobel foundation is related to the nobel family only by name now. none of the family sits on the board of directors of the nobel foundation.

Correction: The central bank prints money, the government doesn't. If the government wants money, they borrow from the public through auctions and bond sales. Money doesn't flow directly from the fed reserve to the treasury.

tech has always been a part of finance, except that they still have to play by all the rules that the sec sets. and unless the other participants in this industry want a visit from the sec, they'd likely avoid doing business with companies that don't play by the rules set by the sec.
problem with companies like uber or airbnb is that they bristle at the thought of regulations - if you want to play in finance, be prepared to get used to this feeling of being watched all the time.
i really really do hope someone with immense bravery, immense pockets, and immense political clout just comes in and says 'forget the rules, we'll play it our way' until the sec breaks, because the regulatory environment in finance has been getting a lot worse over the last few years.

Unfortunately that's also incorrect because congress does not approve fed OMO or expanded operations including QE. Secondly the conflation of monetary base and national borrowing is also totally wrong because those two lie in two different policies (monetary and fiscal resp) that are managed by two different groups that are independent of each other. As you can imagine it is possible to increase the national debt and decrease the monetary base at the same time. In fact this is going to be a strong possibility in the future if the economy recovers quickly, resulting in the fed unwinding its monetary expansion programs while the treasury continues to finance social support programs to match the growth of the economy.

@_date: 2016-05-10 10:21:52
noticed you are talking about QE and the debt clock as roughly the same point of argument. that's not correct. let me clear up a few misconceptions in this thread:
1. the us treasury department does not print money but they issue government debt. this contributes to the debt clock and the debt is used to finance various programs that the government undertakes: infrastructure, social security, etc. the auctions are done with primary dealers and the primary dealers then distribute it to other participants who want them (pensions, insurance, etc)
2. the fed does not issue government debt. however, they do print/destroy money. by exchanging money for government debt (and vice versa) they control the amount of cash flowing in the general economy. this activity has various knock-on effects on the short-term health of the economy. technically, the fed is independent of congress and the us treasury department. and it is well studied that the cosier the relationship between the central bank and the government in different countries leads to higher inflation. practically, the fiscal policy set by congress influences the health of the economy and the health of the economy forces the fed's hand in setting monetary policy.
3. the us treasury department cannot issue debt (borrow) infinitely. this requires an authorization by the Congress. We all expect the Congress to eventually authorize debt issuances but various parties in Congress have threatened to block these twice in the last ten years.

rubbing a few brain cells together will show why this is a pretty obvious conclusion. This is literally like those "eating more makes you fat" health studies.
the department that decides how much money to spend and where to spend it (the US Treasury) needs to be independent of the department that decides when to print money (the Federal Reserve). The moment the two comes together, you get Zimbabwe. As of today, the two departments have different mandates. The US Treasury cannot print any money; to fund themselves, they auction government bonds to the public (i.e. borrow from them to repay in the future). The Federal Reserve cannot decide how the money should be spent. They buy and sell government bonds from the public, hoping that the money that shifts from the Fed to the public (or vice versa) as a result of these operations is allocated for the right purposes, be it infrastructural investments or consumer spending.
We've not had Zimbabwe yet. In fact, we are struggling to even get inflation off the ground. If you were paying attention to the speech yesterday, Yellen is saying inflation is still below their target despite their efforts so the unwinding of the balance sheets is not going to be soon.

The proposed audit the fed bill intends to allow congress to intervene quite deeply into the activities of the federal reserve and other arrangements. You are right to see the non-sequitur: the source of this confusion is the fact that the name of the bill has nothing to do with auditing, the name of the bill is chosen to disguise the real effect of it, because the fed is already audited. But congress needs the fed to "play nice" because they are the ones determining spending policy while being unwilling to raise taxes or cut spending elsewhere to fund such programs. the easiest solution to this problem of profligate benefits to their donors is then to debase the currency in order to cheapen the financial cost of such programs.

OTC dealers know if you don’t buy from them you will have to do it on screen and you pay whatever the screen markets want you to pay... why would they price you spot mid or even spot offer? If you know you’re going to push the price up with a large market order and get $100 in slippage you will happily accept $90 premium if the dealers quote you that. There is no “discount” for large negotiated trades.

the perfect bitcoin investment invests in not just bitcoin but the entire ecosystem - people like square, coinbase, gdax. adoption is by far the  determinant of bitcoin's longevity.
price is near the bottom of the totem pole of importance.
that said, i must learn to recognize that a lot of people involved bitcoin are happy to just punt it back and forth. a few of my peers made a lot of money when it was bouncing between 7-8k, and then again when it was range bound between 6-6.8k and then now they are working on making markets in the 3-4k region. when the money is milked and if bitcoin breathes its last breath they will just move on to the next big thing.

the free market can trade in bitcoin, and the free market can trade in promissory bitcoin, or bitcoin paper, or bitcoin derivatives. they can all coexist. there are so many reasons for wanting to trade paper. one reason is maybe that you are a business and you are waiting for a client to pay you in bitcoin but you need to pay your supplier in bitcoin and you need a bank to "bridge the gap" with fiat or whatever else. that arrangement is a promise and that promise can be traded between businesses just like cheques, commercial papers, notes, repurchase agreements, etc.
for the formal bitcoin market and economy to really take off you still need paper bitcoin.

Fractional reserve bitcoin is good for bitcoin. The fundamental misunderstanding is that only banks depend on fractional reserve. The truth is that the entire world depends on fractional reserve - the farmer taking a loan to grow crops that can only be sold at the next harvest, the miner taking a loan to explore a potential mine, the factory owner spending on building facilities and machines to start making widgets in the future. For a lender to lend, whether it be a bank or a union or a loan shark, the presence of credit bitcoin as a tradable product makes it easy to manage the risk.
This is what can make the world run on bitcoin. When the economy can borrow bitcoin, then they can pay salaries in bitcoin.

the bank is in most countries NOT allowed to tell the owner of the account the reason his account is frozen if it is frozen for money laundering suspicion. for that matter, if an account is frozen in any way, expect to wait a long time for a response while the country banking regulator/crime/corruption bureau takes over.
if you are worried about your bitcount/cash account being frozen, then there are many many things you can do to prevent it (especially if you expect very frequent withdrawals and deposits) - tell the bank your (1) name as registered on an official document (2) contact number (3) most recent address (4) employment (5) source of funds (6) other businesses
