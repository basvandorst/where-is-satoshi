ive never shyed away from a good argument. long as it stays respectful ill spend some time trying to gather information from the other point of view
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:24:58
so heres a quick timeline
12/3/2015 i place the order through their websitem had to call them to finish the order. i paid $400.56 on this day
later that day i get 2 emails, 1 stating that my order has processed and thati will receive notification of shipping, 1 stating myphone has shipped
12/4/2015 - i receive an email from t-mobile, its a receipt of my order. stating that my card was charged, and shows me all the details of the TX. 
12/6/2015 phone comes in the mail and i activate it directly with t-mobile. 
12/16/2015 t-mobile pulls 400.56
12/17/2015 payment fully processes 
12/18/2015 i check my bank and see that i am 400 dollars short. 
edit to add screen shot of the email receipt 
when i called t-mobile today they say that they dont see the charge on my account, even though i was looking at the tx on my banks website. so i ended teh call withthem and got on the horn with the bank. 
told them what happened, provided them with the emails from t-mobile and had them cancel my card, and i opened a dispute with the bank.
there is literally 3 bucks in my bank right now, so i was 3 bucks away from getting hit with an overdraft fee. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:03:55
i actually needed to do this w a while back with some LTC. 
i was using hive wallet, was getting a newphone so i sent the ltc from my hive wallet to my electrum wallet. 
what i didnt know at teh time was that LTC tx fee was super high cause there was an attack onthe network and since teh tx fee was hardcoded into the wallet my tx was pending for almost 2 weeks. 
finally it sent. but if i could have, i would have sent a higher fee to unstick that tx. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:40:27


if it is possible to embed the name of the merchant into a tx, then it should be possible to embed the name of the merchant and the order number, no?
when merchant makes the request for the payment they would create the tx and embed the users account number and order number. then when the user submits payment for the order they could include the order number and customer number as well. this way when looking at the raw tx we could see the customer(by the database of the merchant) paid x bitcoin for order y. 


the only solution i can think to this is by registering wallets to people, but that just sounds like a horrible idea in all honesty. forgive my ignorance on this particular topic. but from my understanding of HD wallets, they create child addresses related to a single parent address. everything i state below is based on the theory that since a single seed can create many different addresses, it should be possible to trace those multiple address back to a single source 
if there was a system that was in place that would watch tx's and count how many times vendor x sent a tx request(those details would be in the tx itslef). And counted how many times that request was answered, we could use that to determine that merchant x owns the wallet that generated all of the addresses created during payment request. (simaliar to how torrents have seeders, the more seeds a torrent has the faster you can download it. the more counts an address has the more faith you have the merchant will decide to not claim the wallet by signing a message)
The merchant would have to be willing to sacrifice all the funds held in the wallet and the 3rd party processes would have to act in conjunction with the merchant to rip off one customer and lose all of it positive reputation. and have to start over from scratch, but who would trust them then?
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:53:53
thats the rub, the part of t-mobile that charged my card for the 2nd time wasnt t-mobile proper but the part of the company that only takes orders. so when i called 611 from the phone the account rep, and supervisors had no knowledge of the tx on my account. but 
when i called the ordering department they were able to see that tx but refused to return the money. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:56:19


actually, i have about 10k to my name in bitcoin. whatever money that is left over after paying bills and what not i put into bitcoin. so at any point in time i only have enough money in my bank account to pay for the things i actually need. 
so yes thank you for being a dick.

@_date: 2015-12-18 16:56:15
i paid for a phone, they shipped said phone out. then 2 weeks later they charged me again. 
the only mixup here is that t-mobile charged my account twice.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:02:49
It was me being still groggy from sleep. I had my circle wallet address copied to the clipboard. Coin was sent to that wallet. Just plain ol user error. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:43:26


i filled out the online info to do the purchase online, as i also hate talking on the phone. 
when i submitted everything, i got a pop-up saying that their order system is down and to call t-mobile direct to finish my order. 
the phone rep did create a new order for me, he said that since the original order was online, he had to create a new one since i was calling in.

true, but with bitcoin if i sent a tx to a wallet they control and they didnt mark it as sent, i could always use the block chain and prove that the money was sent. 
but like i said, im just upset that without my consent they were able to take money from my account. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:57:34
i had 500 in my bank account as of 2 days ago. that 500 was going to be used to pay for groceries after i got off work today and to rent a car for christmas travelling. 
i have money in savings, but that savings is in the form of bitcoin. 
i only keep money in my bank account to cover expenses 
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:47:19
well considering that the majority of Americans dont have a savings of &gt;$1000, i think am more than fine. 
and did you read my edits. i never said i only have $500 dollars. i said i had $500 in the bank as that is all the money i needed to make it through to my next pay day. 
!~75% of my first check every month takes care of rent, bills, groceries. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:11:59
Me and the wife have a savings account as well. And we have about the same amount of fiat in that savings account as we do in bitcoins. So I wasn't put in a situation where I don't have access to money. 
What I was upset about and still upset about is that t-mobile with out my authorization was able to pull $400 from my account without authorization. 
I could have worded my op in a better fashion. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:30:51
thats the querstion i asked t-mobile and they dont even see the tx on my account.

@_date: 2015-06-23 13:13:10
how do i does that?
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:17:59


ive never set up a merchant account with bitpay, but i have setup other online merchant accounts before so that is the only experiences i have to draw from
when i have setup online merchant accounts before, i would have to provide the 3rd party processor with my banks routing and account number. so in those instances both me(as the merchant) and the 3rd party processor would have knowledge of the dollar bank account. 


im looking for the thread now and i may not have all the details correct but in essence.someone posted an idea where you can embed the name of the merchant(or the account number, i honestly dont remember the details) into the actual bitcoin tx. using some method like that it would be possible, but at the moment there would be no way(that i am aware of at least) to look at a tx and determine what said tx was for. you would have to use data outside of the tx to 100% determine what it was for. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:56:23
true, and i really dont have a valid argument against that at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:17:42
1 lochness
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:24:34
if they provide an wallet address for payment, how can they deny that they dont control that address. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:36:03
I appreciate the discourse. Like I said I probably didn't express myself properly in my op. I was upset. But the point that I was upset about is something that would not be possible with bitcoin. 
I'm 33 years old, with a kid on the way. I absolutely 100% believe that Bitcoin will survive and become something that changes society. 
Me and the wife have been trying to have a kid for a while and as much as I believe that Bitcoin will change the world, I know that diapers need to be changed sooner then Bitcoin will become mainstream, hence the savings in fiat as well. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:22:25
i know ill get all the money back, but my point of contention is that t-mobile never would have had the ability to double charge me if i had been able to setup an account and pay via bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:07:29
that it is, but it shall take up to 10 days, and by then the holidays would have passed as the need for me to rent the car to see our families. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:32:43
A very valid point. In my situation, I don't use coin see or circle. I use bread wallet and airbitz. So the address my coins came from belong to me and not a 3rd party. So yes I would be able to without a doubt prove that the sending address is in my total control. 
I would say that I could prove the address I sent to is owned by t-mobile. Most merchants don't run their own wallet, they use a third party to run that for them. So in this hypothetical situation, t-mobile and their 3rd party processor would have to colloud together in order to steal 400 dollars from me. It doesn't make any logical sense for a multimillion dollar company(t-mobile and the 3rd party processor) to try to run a scam for $400 when if they were found out, could cause the lose of money many, many more times then that. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:31:07
heres my thinking on this particular issue you mentioned. 
i never send money to a wallet without knowing who the owner is. 
so if i buy something from newegg or tiger direct, they pop up a page saying send payment to this address, that tell me that newegg/tigerdirect have control of that address, ortherwise they wouldnt have me send bitcoin to it. 
i send money to the wallet specified by the merchant i am buying product for. once the tx is sent, i can view it on the blockchain. once the tx has received 3 confirms they would be able to do with it as they wish. 
it dont make sense to me that a company would say send me btc to this address, and then try and say they dont control said address. 
seems like in a situation like that it would be the merchants(or 3rd party who runs their wallet) problem and not the end user. 
i could easily prove i own the account that i sent the btc from by signing a message from it. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:07:57
im an average joe and this is a problem it solves for me. my job pays me in direct deposit, my wifes does not. both of us have bad credit and cant open a new bank account. so my check gets put into her back, her bank is in indiana and we both live and work in chicago. 
when she gets paid we cash the check, convert to bitcoin via BTC machine and then send coin to circle and then convert to fiat. 
TL;DR 
Check&gt;Cash&gt;Bitcoin&gt;deposit to bank account. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:26:13
It would be fairly simple to prove T2. T-mobile uses a 3rd party proccessor, bitpay. So the burden of proof would be on bitpay to show evidence that the wallet address provided to me by t-mobile wasn't a wallet addres that t-mobile has control. 
Bitpay could do a simple search and determine if the wallet the funds were sent to is a t-mobile controlled address or not. 
With that being said, I will say that trust is being placed on the 3rd party processor. But that trust isn't being placed on them by me, it's being placed on them by t-Mobile as they made the decision to use a 3rd party processor. 
Edit to add, I said bitpay but you can switch that name out for any other 3rs party bitcoin processor as t-Mobil doesn't accept bitcoin in the states. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:58:31
i guess my point was more to the fact that t-mobile had the authority to go into my bank account and take 400 with out my consent. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:58:35
Half life 3 confirmed. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:30:12


i think you missing what im saying. the original order was paid for on the 3rd and processed on the 4th. yesterday they charged my card again for the same amount. 
the issue isnt that the order was lost, but that they charged me twice. once when i placed the order and then again yesterday. 
if my understanding of bitcoin is correct, my original order for 400 would have reached them properly, but t-mobile would not have been able to take 400 from me yesterday if i had a bitcoin only account with them. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:38:29
i honestly have no idea. i think it was just sleepyness. 
i have multiple wallets on my phone(breadwallet/hive/circle)
and i think i was just too sleepy. im used to tapping the screen and copying my address to the clip board. well instead of tapping the actual address i just tapped teh qr code(thinking it had copied the address to my clipboard). 
opened up the shapeshift app. pasted the btc address and then sent my LTC. 
'i must have had on old address copied to the clipboard and thats what was pasted. 
just a regular user error due to sleepiness and user error.

some of the banks were BOA, BMO, CHASE pretty big names in my book at least.

@_date: 2015-12-18 15:39:15

@_date: 2014-06-30 19:34:32
thats not the point i am getting at. the point i am getting at is that at the moment the major banks are telling regular people sorry but since you participated in "bitcoin activities" your account is now closed. 
so my question is: of all the banks that have closed down regular peoples accounts due to "Bitcoin Activites" how many of those banks transferred money for the auction, which is "Bitcoin Activity"
i guess what i am trying to say is. why are banks making it almost impossible and punishing for the regular user to purchase bitcoins, while completely facilitating other people to purchase bitcoins

to clarify, im not saying the charger or 300c came in a 5-120 bolt circle. i meant that most rear wheel drive cars either come in a 5-115/5-114.3 or 5-120. there are some exceptions to the rule. lincoln 5-108, benz 5-112. 
when you get into trucks you got a whole variety of bolt circle applications. 6-132,6-135, 6-180 or 150 can remeber(old school range). 8 bolt circles for certain suburbans and hummers.

i still see paper wallets and SMS wallets as a stop gap. the holy grail of BTC tx is being able to spend some BTC as easily and simple as it is to spend cash or make credit. having to load a paper wallet or load a mobile wallet is a step that doesnt need to happen when spending cash or credit / debit. 
the less friction we have when it comes to spending BTC the quicker the adoption rate will go. 
at least i think
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:43:47

no im not. i sold asantis for many years. 22's with tires. regardless if it was a front wheel drive or rear wheel drive setup, as long as no mods were added to the wheels, total cost with tires is $6000-$6500. and that is with your choice of tire. pirelli, toyo, nitto, hankook. if people wanted it cheaper we could go with some wanli's, or even the shitty ass lexani tire they came out with. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:36:53
i really think your missing the crux of the issue here. 
im not saying t-mobile lost my money, or my payment. im saying that after i authorized t-mobile to take $400, they without my authorization took another $400 dollars from my bank account. 
if t-mobile would be BTC friendly and offer accounts in BTC, then i would have sent them the 400, and they would have no way for them to pull another 400 from my account. 
the only lost money here is the second 400 they took 2 days ago. and now i have to go through a bank dispute and wait at the very max 10 business days to have access to my money, which t-mobile had no authorization to take in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:14:33
i don't think your argument hold any water. with the U.S. Dollar one, and only one agency(person) has the authority to mint U.S. Dollar. but with BTC and other cryptos anyone with enough CPU or GPU power can mint a block.

full disclosure: i have sold all my miners from ZenMiner Platform
this journey for me started almost a year ago, when i purchsed a Gridseed Blade from Gaw for $1600. couple of days later, no more then 3 days,  the price dropped by half to $800. 
called gaw got store credit and purchased Balde  
Order  was late. by a day
Order  was also late buy a day or 2 dont remember. 
Josh personally gave me a call and made things right with a combo of store credit and some free hosting time on the original cloud hashing system. 
i kept ordering equipment and there was always an issue with my order. not one order was completed on time. i would frequently be issued DHL tracking numbers only to have fedex deliver it. 
But i will say this, i paid for about 80-90MH of scrypt mining power in total and due to all the freebies they gave me i ended up with 144MH of Hashlet Primes. the whole time i was mining on Zenz magic pool Zenpool. I call it a magic pool not to throw jabs at gaw but to point out that this pool in particular would always, there was some days it wasnt the highest but those were rare.) payout at least double the highest rated pool. 
i made some bank. made my roi and then some. 
i was a super happy camper, so i decided to buy some Zens on the Hashmarket for cheap. i purchased 200MH of Zen hashlets. soon after payouts for the zenpool dropped, massively. 
Then one day i wake up and see that i owe Gaw 1.4BTC, i received an email later in the day saying that due to a bug in their platform a small minority of the people were being paid 2-3 times the regular amount. 
i have to stop here and say that because Gaw's system always worked for me, after the first couple of months, i just stopped double checking the numbers. it went from taking the payout i was given, subtracting the hosting fee and see if i was paid waht i was suppossed to be paid. to just waking up and seeing if my payment was there. It was clockwork baby. if the payment wasnt there when i woke up it would be there when i got to work. so since i stopped keeping track of numbers, and in consideration of the free amount of stuff gaw gave me(some of which were re-imbursements for loss of mining time) i said :oh well. Dont bitch when its good for you, dont bitch when its bad for you") 
I paid off the debt and then things just got weird for me. i cant point my finger to it or say this is the reason why, but things just dont feel right for me. so i sold all my miners, made all my money back and then some and im sitting on about 33000 HP. 
i plan to trade for their paycoin and sell that for BTC as soon as possible. 
Im not sure what it is like i said earlier, but something there really gets my weird meter flying off the handle.

depends on the size of the rim(width). and depends on the car. for a rear wheel drive car(charger, 300c,) the most popular applications with a +15 offset and a 5-114.3 or 5-120 bolt circle the perfect tire for the front and back on those applications are the 265/35/22. the rim would be 22x8.5 in the front and 22x10 in the back. 
on your specific application with 22in asantis. standard fit is 22x7.5 in the front and you can stretch the back all the way up to 22x12 if you so choose. 
for your car, i would set it up with the following specs. 
front 22x7.5. the tire i would go with would be the 245/35/22, but if you really wanted the rubber band look i would set you up with the 245/30/22. 
for the back, if you wanted a really deep lip, which is what everyone is looking for now a days. it would put you at a 22x12. the tire would have to be absolutley no choice about it 295/3022. hell depending on the price i would be able to pick up those tires i might even use those for a 22x10 rim. 
any other questions?

dear op, you were the push that i needed.
signed up for an account like 2 weeks ago but just wasnt sure if it was a trust worthy company, and to be honest with you i was lazy and didnt feel like searching. so i just put it off.

i am a 31 year old man, and if i ever have to write a check i always and i mean always put "For sexual favors" in the memo line.

but then i made a purchase for btc via coinbase and chase informed me that they would close my account.

you have got to be joking. when i was a younger version of me. my parents picked up a brand new printer/scanner/copier full color laser printer. 
first thing i did was copy and print a $20 dollar bill. took all of 20 minutes to get the sides to match up properly and within 5 minutes of that it was spent at the local corner store. 
with the high quality printers available now, its super easy

with tires take your pick. either the 295 toyo or the 245 pirelli, hancok(forgot how to spell it). base price for stock asantis with tires in a 22 is 6-6500. you said they were for an athlete, that makes a little more sense. in chicago there is a shop called Mr. Lee's. he sells to all the famous people. and he constantly sells for close to double the price. just cause they have money.  
didnt mean to accuse, just wanted to make sure. plenty of people try and hustle people over and being somewhat of an expert in this field, figured i would throw out my expertise to those who are unknowledgeable.

how big is the lip on the rear wheels. you said you paid 12k for the rims. that means you had to have them customized. extra wide lip, possibly curved face to make the lip bigger. just trying to see if you really paid 12k for the rims or if your trying to hustle people. 
full disclosure. i use to sell(family business) asantis. my pops still does. 22's for a benz with low-pro tires(nitto/pirelli/toyo) should not be more then 6500. unless you added some extras to the rims, such as color coded, curved face, extended lip.

we would have to change how people sign into pools. none of this 1 username 500 workers. it would have to be setup in such a way that anyone who mines would have to create an account that would also be the worker. 
THE Bitcoin protocol itself is beautiful simple, really fucking genius. designed and meant to work in a world where greed does not exist. even Satoshi himself had to plead with the community to hold off on the arms race with GPU to mine BTC so newcomers could mine and make some BTC coin with their less efficient CPU's. 
but being as we are all human and we love to gorge ourselves on anything that brings us pleasure or profit, and in some cases things that only do us harm. the arms race began, people started mining the shit out of bitcoin with their GPU, and pools started forming so that people would still have a chance to mine some BTC. and now as unless you can drop 20-30k on a rig you aint gonna be able to mine any bitcoin. and because of that very reason people in developing nations, who just simply cannot afford that investment will look to other cryptos that do allow them to be able mine and generate coins for themselves without have to A) pay a big upfront cost or B) pay / work for those coins.

my grammar and spelling have always sucked, thankyou for spelling and grammar checks in word. 
I wasn't trying to come off as arrogant, just really trying to spark a conversation in the community to see what everyone else thinks. 
your absolutely correct an Eco-system is currently being built around BTC. which in turn will help strengthen BTC, both in value and in market share. and where i think that the other cryptos bring that BTC just cannot today is accessibility. i think right now,The view is starting to change of BTC from an internet thing to something to be taken serious. and once BTC is seen as serious, then i think that will bleed to other cryptos as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:53:22
great call kid. the only thing that really sucks at this time in the bitcoin game is. that as a single user it is almost impossible to mine for a bitcoin unless you have some really expensive rig. someone please correct me if i am wrong. i think right now the best was to get into bitcoin is to either A) start purchasing in small amounts till you have what you believe is a decent size. B) Sell items you were gonna sell any for BTC, C). Labor (either physical or intellectual). 
I wish i would have followed my instincts more back in 09 when i first learned about bitcoin.

i bought 1/4 BTC @ 590 w/o issues yesterday
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:08:01
i do see the difference, i think it is huge. 
but here is the issue i have with it. 
i was a long time chase customer. literally my 1st bank account ever was at chase. it was opened by my parents when i was five and fully turned over to me when i was 18. at the age of 31, after purchasing 1 single bitcoin from coinbase chase told me that they were closing my account.
when i called in and asked why they basically told me it was cause i bought bitcoins.
so here is where my mind starts making connections. 
there are accounts of Chase, BOA, BMO and CITI closing bank accounts for people after 2-3 bitcoin purchases. 
i would like to know what banks these wire transfers were from and then cross reference that with banks that have closed accounts because of bitcoin purchase. 
to me at least, this seems like a discriminatory process with legal recourse.

you pay in BTC to over stock. coinbase then takes the BTC and converts it to cash and the deposits it into the overstock bank account. 
so while it isnt a 100% btc payment option. you are still able to pay in BTC. which is a great first step in my opinion. 
when ever the volitality of BTC levels out im sure well see companies actually keep some BTC. 
right now i dont think it makes sense, business wise at least, for them to keep the BTC. if the price takes a dramatic price drop it would seriously effect their bottom line on anything they sold.

when you apply for a loan, you have the option to peg your loan to the usd or to BTC. so for example. 
if i took out a loan today for $1000 and pegged it to USD when, my loan would be the 1000+interest on loan. 
if i pegged it to BTC that same $1000 = 2.145 BTC at price right now. at the end of my loan i would have to pay back 2.145 + interest BTC. if the price of BTC skyrockets you could end up in a jam. 
I myself have a loan there and pegged it to USD, got it at 621, and now it at 466. if i had pegged it to BTC it would have been  better for me. 
i like the service, i was funded rather quickly and have paid all payments on time.

just messing with ya, but honestly that is a huge issue for me as well. but as i said in another post. they way i look at BTC is, "i was gonna spend that money anyway" at least this way i have a chance of gaining that money back. 
shit if i was sitting on a nice little BTC stack, i would see some right now to help with mortgage and bills. 
i really do beleive the next 6months to 1.5 years will be a very rollercoaster ride for BTC before we even get close to what a "Fair market value" of a BTC is.

but with coinbase you are not mining for any coins, you are buying and selling them, which i mentioned in my OP as one of the ways to get into the BTC game. 
from my understanding of BTC that the only way to get a bitcoin, without purchasing it or working(physically or intellectually) for it. Would be to mine for it. and the only way to mine for a bitcoin is to use, at the beginning a CPU but now only feasable with high-powered GPU's. 
if i am wrong please point me to where i can find the correct information.

appeal to the masses. unless some huge revolution happens to cryptos any and all cryptos are the same. the only thing that sets them apart is marketing. and DOGE has that in spades. Currently in this world, without doing any research, i can think of 3-5 things that did absolutely nothing to improve upon the product they copied, but because they were marketed better, they won. 
DOGE got my mom, dad, sister, and GF into cryptos. something that BTC could not do. DOGE is the enrty point into cryptos. us Shibes thank BTC, because honestly without you and LTC we would not be here. and now that DOGE is here, and as it gets more and more popular it will only help BTC and LTC. 
DOGE the red-headed step child of cryptos. no one likes us, but they have to put up with us.

this is the way that i look at it. many people have compared bitcoin to the internet, and when the internet was first released to the public, no one could really give you a good answer to what the internet is or what the internet could do. but in in 2014 the question now is, what cant the internet do. and as bitcoin grows and it becomes more and more wildly accepted. and more and more applications and services are developed for the bitcoin protocol. the question will no longer be what is bitcoin, but what cant bitcoin do.

@_date: 2014-02-13 04:09:56
thats your cost, with mark-up. and if you bought it from the dealer the dealer didnt buy them from Asanti. they bought them from a retail shop like my pop's. so now your paying for 3 mark-ups, the dealers, the retail shop and the original manufacture. Asanti doesn't accept one-off orders(except if your famous) you have to sign a contract and commit to moving a certain amounts of units per quarter, and if you don't move them you still pay.
4 Asanti rims. 2-22x10 &amp; 2 22x75 or 8.5, no extras, straight chrome with your exact size tires I easily make 2k on the sale. direct dealers for Asanti get the wheels between $1000-$3000 per wheel. we were one of the few in Chicago who got the deepest discount. 
same with the tires, direct dealers get huge discounts because the volume is big. for example every month we would receive a shipping containers worth of tires, like clock work. same with wheels, we would move them quick as we sold them.

maybe you cant, i did and if i wanted i still could. you think tire rack is selling tires their cost. $750-1500 a tire(depending on size and brand) your crazy.
my asanti order every quarter every quarter was $500,000. we were asantis  dealer in Chicago, wheel pros, American racing. we help Giovanna break onto the scene. when they first debuted as wheel line, they weren't making no fancy 2 and 3 piece wheels. 1 piece cast wheels, with a beautiful chrome finish. bought there 20in wheels for 250 a pop. sold em like hot cakes. 
you wanted to break a wheel line, you brought it to chicago and put it on the racks at gomez tires.

Me and the gf use a bank called first merchants, located in northwest Indiana. Their customer service sucks, they have no after hour phone operators. And since we live I'm chicago it is a hassle to make it to a bank a state away to deposit cash( she is a hair stylist). But never once have we received a call or a letter from them threatening to cancel our account. We make regular btc purchased once a week and have since December. For all that they do bad, they let me purchase btc with no issues and that's more than enough for me to keep banking there, for now.

I'm not sure that's a fair comparison. with BTC your machine has to literally mine for the coin. with email you dont have to......I'm not quite sure how to compare mining for a block to sending an email. but, back to the topic. a crypto wont gain in popularity or market share or value unless it is mined. 
the longer a crypto exist the harder it gets to mine it. as it nears towards impossible to mine.I think that people looking to enter into the crypto world will seek out other cryptos to mine to try and build it in acceptance as this community did to BTC.

hey thats super similar to the post i made on facebook about it. 
Dear Benjamin Lawsky ,
i liked your page so i could tag you in this post. I finally got some time to sit down and read your version of the sunday funnies AKA your proposed bitcoin licenses and regulations.
To put it bluntly, your a fucking idiot. That entire paper only serves to exemplify just how scared you and the entire banking, remittance and credit card processing industries really are.
Do you really think the community who took bitcoin from being worth less than a penny to over $600 today, take this sitting down. If your main concern is the prevention of money laundering and illegal activity. then maybe you should aim your sights on JPMorgan Chase who have been fined over and over again for laundering money for drug cartels. Or even focus on the CIA and the FBI that constantly sell weapons of war to drug lords and terrorist.
You arguments hold no water, your logic is faulty but worst of all you and your actions are dictated by fear, selfishness and greed.
P.S. to the NSA Contractor who will eventually read this and flag it as a potential threat, suck my balls.

i think BTC is still in the "growing pains" phase of its existence. no one at this point can say what one coin is really worth. in the last 30 days it has fallen and risen like a roller coaster at opening day. these next 10-12 months will be very crucial to BTC.

i think that the monthly pay for a service will come to an end when it comes to BTC. you might be asked to pay for like 6 months upfront. 
unless they can use some type of escrow service where the BTC get sent to a wallet and it needs to be signed by you and the service provider to be released at a specific date

I think they'll always be pump-and-dumpers. also i'm not sure even BTC is a house hold name yet. i think its a very small minority of the world populace that is aware of BTC. I think the compelling force would be the ease in mining it compared to BTC. there's some pretty powerful and cheap tablets out there, can you mine on a tablet? serious question. 
I do not think that BTC will be the end to the world's money problems, but i do see cryptos as evolving into a decent sized supplemental income to you regular income. unless you were a BTC pioneer, as i saw it referenced before, there's no reason to think you will become stupid rich off of this.

your absolutely right. my fault.  ive been in and out of the BTC community since 09. never signing up for an account just always lurking. i completely believe in the bitcoin protocol and the bitcoin itself. 
some background info on my skillset. graduated in 2011 with a bachelors in IT. and am curretnly in school to learn coding for mobile devices. 
i am currently reading into how to setup a pool, but i figured that the community at whole would be able to give me some advice as how to set something like this up. 
the reason i decided to post is that when i signed in to the board today the majority of post were about gash.io and that someone needs to setup a p2p pool so i decided that since everyone is talking about setting one up. that i would go ahead and set one up for the betterment of the community. 
just trying to be a part of the solution

not at all, they were converted to BTC because there is no DOGE to USD exchange. 
what happened to this sub. the same arguments and attacks yall place on any altcoin is the same arguments and attacks that used to be thrown at BTC. 
why are you guys so opposed to any other coin that is not BTC. saying that no other coin besides BTC is worthless is like saying why buy any other car when you can own a Bentley.

and it did. they came at us. we had a huge audit, spanning something like 15 years i think. if my mom hadn't been so fucking good at keeping immaculate records we would have gotten royally screwed by the IRS.
our situation was a little different. the bank we did a majority of our banking with was literally down the block from the business. the bank literally had a day to day view of watching the business grow. we took a majority of our loans through them. 
they got us for some technical thing. some of the receipts from when the business first started had no tax on them. so the receipt read 30 bucks total. but we would charge the person say 24.50 plus tax. and just made the hand written receipt for 30 bucks. parents didnt know any better, they were immigrants trying to make an honest living.

those rims are not straight chrome. the face is painted and the ring is painted as well. rivits are chrome(which they charge you more for because their asanti and they just do). 
painted face @ $250 per wheel = $1000
painted ring @ 150 per wheel = $600
Chrome rivets @ 100 per wheel = $400
total in extras =                        $2000
i passed that cost directly onto you or the dealerships i sold to. brings the final selling price to $8500 i still keep my 2k profit. i was selling in volume. i didnt care about the extras, still dont. 
the regular profit on a 22"" set of rims and tires is on a really good sale, less then $300. you sell an Asanti, Giovonna, T.I.S, Makevili your profit sky rockets. and since i didnt charge extra for the extras i could beat anyone else out in price since the smaller shops paid a higher premium for their asantis due to lack of volume that they had to charge for extras to make a profit.

I used to work with family. For a family business. Primarerly a cash business. We sold after market rims and tires. We would deposit 2-3 times a week. I personally would make those deposits. Each deposit would be $9,900. We did this for 2 reasons. 
1. We didn't have to file paper work, on it. 
2. That is what the insurance we had covered( they actually covered us to 15k I beleive) 
Have you ever filled out the paper work associated with a deposit over the 10k. This shit is ridiculous. First the teller has to count the money, If they know what their doing they immediately call a manager, if not they input into the computer and then they are promoted to get a manager. 
Manager comes over and has to recount the money. Then you have to answer questions and fill out paper work. The whole process takes anywhere from an hour to 2. Who the fuck has time for a 2 hour bank visit to deposit money

former miner at gaw here.
i made some good money mining with them, not standing up for them, just stating my experience.
i started with their physical miners and converted to cloud miners. i was making decent money at first. i would constantly watch all the rates at the available multipools and constantly switch to maximize my profits.
then gaw's personal scrypt pool came out, and boy did i make bank. to this day i have no real proof as to how they were able to payout that high, for so long. something to do with leased mining power, but still their payouts were great.
i was mining with 144MH of primes getting paid out at .06 BTC on average.
then just like pancake said, the bottom dropped out. i stuck around a little bit after josh said it would be a few days before payouts return to normal.
then, mining Hashpoints became a thing, and i ran the fuck away. sold my recently purchased 300 zenhashlets and my 144 primes.
looking back at it now, if i was a man who wanted to take advantage of people. i would have mined the fuck outta those hashpoints and when sold all of em for XPY&gt;BTC.
i ended up with enough hashpoints for 84xpy. with those 84xpy i made ~5 btc on cryptsy. at 4 dollars a coin from hashpoints and the market sitting at ~8-10 dollars a coin, i woulda made a mint, and im sure plenty people did.
started with gaw, made some coin, didnt like what gaw was trying to do, sold miners and XPY for BTC.

just wanna say a big shout out to tuft &amp; needles. saw a post a while back saying that they accept BTC for goods. 
so seeing as the Gf has been asking for a new mattress, and i being a BTC person, decided to give them my hard earned BTC for the mattress. 
couple of things i wanna point out. The customer service of this company is matched by none. 
i placed my order with these guys on the eve of christmas eve, December 23rd. 
for some reason by the time the BTC hit the address designated by T&amp;N, it had expired and my order was not marked as paid. 
i sent an email to their support not expecting to hear back until after Christmas, and let it be. minutes later i get an email from  their customer support saying thell look into it. i responded back with screen shots from my circle wallet(showing payment sent) and screenshots from blockchain.info(showing the payment was received). 
Christmas eve i get an email saying that the address expired before the btc hit, and that coinbase(i believe thats the service they use) contacted them and the sale was marked as complete my order will ship soon. 
mattress came in today and i just put in on th bed. waiting for the GF to come home so she can put the sheets on it. 
gotta say, i love BTC and Tuft &amp; Needles. 
edit: forgot to press shift
also big customer service props to the whole company and Kelly Y and Phil L. 
yall earned a lifetime customer.

i dont know is thats the text book definition, im sure there has to be something in there about procuring the money through illegal means. but that is neither here nor there. 
to date, i have not seen any specific reasons to accounts being cancelled other than "Bitcoin activities" or it is against company policy. 
buying bitcoins, selling bitcoins is not illegal. 
since all banks are privately owned companies, then they do have the right to "refuse service" to anyone they want. one of the perks of owning your own business. 
what i am seeing more and more is regular people, me included, get their bank accounts shutdown because they purchased a bitcoin, or part of a bitcoin. 
if the main reason behind this is due to money laundering then should not every single deposit that is in American dollar form not be accepted, since the American dollar is the currency of choice for criminals and counterfeits alike. 
also is this not what these people or companies who bidded on these coins plan to do. 
buy the coins cheap, sell them and then buy some more. 
how is that different then what most people do.

@_date: 2017-03-15 01:59:55
did you have the same stance when core caused a hard fork?
they were the only bitcoin client so they better be exceptional ?
you can not like core or not like BU, but to try and vilify BU for a mistake that it made and dismiss it is disingenuous if you didnt hold the same view when core made mistakes that were similar and on occasion worse
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:49:16
core literally caused a Hardfork, but whatevs, they are not BU. 
all im saying is that its easy to atackl the new guy on the block and refer to them as jokes, but even your A team made mistakes, some of them being more serious then causing nodes to crash.

Here's 1/10 of it back
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:30:18
i dont understand how if the money was withdrawn from my bank acocunt the same day i made the purchase, then how exactly did paypal send them any money in advance. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:09:33
i did get an email from the initial transfer. but no email was received ever about the money going to my paypal account. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:02:18
nope, i checked my email inbox, spam, and every other folder. no email was sent to me letting me know MY money was in the possession of paypal. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 03:57:54
thats exactly my complaint. 
i initiated a transfer my my bank, then asked for a refund. i would think that the money taken from my bank to pay the bill, when refunded would be placed bank in my bank and not on paypal wallet. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 03:25:10
heres some icing on the cake. just tried to send some LTc form my wive wallet, tx doesnt show up on any block explorer for LTC. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:14:28
This alone WILL make me switch from IOS to android. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 05:59:43
i use it. had my HR lady set aside X amount of dollars to the bank account for bit wage. the next day around noon i have btc sent to my wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:57:45
sounds like this is a feature we need to make standard in all wallets going forward

i had hive. but i found out its has central serves and you could be locked out of your funds. so i switched to breadwallet on people recommendations. now im basiclly being called an idiot for listening to the community. regardless i think this shows a huge problem in mobile wallets and needs to be fixed asap.

well the crazy part is, that i did 3 tx in a row to shape shift, 2 of 3 worked seamlessly. its the 3rd one causing me problems. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:53:38
just heard back from shapeshift, they will honer the exchange rate of when i placed the order. 
i absolutely love these guys. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:04:06
yes it is. happy i sold a bunch at $8 yesterday. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:27:04
Oh man. I hope it goes through soon. Was sending this to shape shift and LTC alresdy jumped over 40 cents since I tried to convert. Hopefully the convert at the rate it was when I sent it in and not what it is now. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:39:56
well considering i didnt have a choice on the tx fee, i would say at the most im a victim of wallet software. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:20:44


care to offer any insght as to why i should do that?
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:22:21
i is american, and if it wasnt for me investing in LTC i wouldnt be able to take a vacation, and i make a decent salary. life is tooo damn expensive.

i dont consider it a lie, i just think the customer service rep was either mis-informed or misspoke. etiher way they handled it and im a happy guy and will continue to use their service. 
as someone who used to work in customer support, policies change all the time and its hard to keep up to date no matter how hard you try. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:13:32
Bought a majority of my LTC sub $2. Only picked up to get s nice round 1000
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:31:41
i think right now btc is stagnant because we cant come to a consensus, on anything. i can go back, but i really dont want to, and show the cluster fuck that happens whenever anything is trying to be changed. 
besides the current issue right now, look at the bits debate. how long did that rage for, and for what. at the end of the day what did that really solve. 
we couldnt even get our shit together for something as trivial as that. fast forward to know and look at the massive cluster fuck that is surrounding the block size debate. this is a massive issue and one that absolutely needs to be solved, but we cant. as soon as a solution to this is discovered i expect btc to just float around in price
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:35:33
i see your point, i really do. but i dont think its as simple as you make it. 
sure they depend on the blockchain, and it has its limitations. but they also depend on 3rd parties. shapeshift has no control over wallet software. 
so i could easily argue that the cause of the delay was my inability to set the fee due to the feature lacking in the software. so in fact the problem was caused by the developer of the wallet i was using. 
now if i was using a wallet created by shapeshit and using shapeshift to change my coins, and i still had a delay then i would without a doubt say it was their fault. 
too many variables to lay blame solely on one service. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:49:37
possibly, i really like it cause they convert the coins quick and easy. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:41:55


breadwallet comes highly recommended, are you saying that bread wallet is a shitty wallet?

That's the killer development. Instant access. 
The moment I'm a me to turn btc to cash(from any country) instantly it's over. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:59:20
well the problem isnt that the wallet software sucked(has drawbacks) but that there are people / a person that has decided to flood the network with spam. 
if spam was properly handled this wouldnt be an issue. 
at the end of the day, i think this very situation i am in is going to cause some big improvements to BTC
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:50:25
So to clarify. I sent the btc. Shapeshift immediately notified me that they had funds. The delay was in the btc network confirming the tx. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:30:35
almost didnt, was 3/4 through a bottle of wine and about 95% asleep. lol
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:10:36
i sent this via bread wallet from my iphone. all other payments confirmed super quick, but this guy been stuck for over 12 hours already, im a little concerned. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:41:15
im in the same boat. almost 2 days now and no confirmation. i used breadwallet though
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:38:35
all my coin is in that wallet. so sending them to a new wallet would only cause me to have trhe rest of my coin in limbo. oh well we play the wait game
@_date: 2015-07-10 11:10:22
breadwallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:40:29
is there any way a miner can force the tx in a block, would pay $5 in btc to make it happen?
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:30:02

i asked the same question and was laughed at for using IOS. too many people here willing to berate you yet offer no advice. 
i just found ninke wallet in the app store, never used it but gonna give it a shot. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:02:10
what wallet would you suggest for IOS
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:01:14

@_date: 2015-07-29 05:48:19
I agree with you. Their customer service is amazing. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:05:13
man, i would pay $5 right now to get my tx in teh next block to get my BTC shapeshifted to LTC
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:19:46
didnt have a choice, wallet software didnt let me specify fee amount. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:42:10
i didnt get a choice in tx fee. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 21:20:35
if i remeber correctly, on the bitcoin talk forum a few months back, as btc was rising past $400, someone made a post and forgot a the word "it" so instead of "this is it gentlemen" he posted "This is Gentlemen" 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:32:05
as a former rapper, i would totally rock a qr code chain. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:50:38
i feel like people are quick to say, if you use the proper fee your tx get in the next block no problem. 
well thats a huge problem, with this wallet i was unable to set the tx fee,it was set for me. 
i feel like people are asking me to fix this problem when with the tools available to me i cannot. 
which makes me think we have a bugger issue here. just cantplace my finger on it
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:37:39
manty moons ago, about 3 years ago, i purchased my first .1 of bitcoin through virwox. 
i got my coin, but paid a premium. the entire time i thought i was gonan get scammed. took a few days for my coins to come in, something about first time purchases take time and what not. 
that was my experience. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:24:16
it wasnt their fault, if anything at the core of the issue is that i wasnt able to set the fee for my wallet, so the blame should be placed on the creator of the wallet. 
but even then you can say well if the btc network wasnt under a spam attack then the fee size would not have mattered because it should have gone through with the fee hard-coded into the wallet. 
we could sit here and point fingers all day but that dont fix shit.

@_date: 2015-07-08 12:13:04
Thanks for all the info guys. I was suoer worried for a second. This was the 3rd of 3 transactions to shapeshift and the only one that caused me issued. Hopefully it goes through today. 
Is there anything I can do to up the fee or is it too late?
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:52:38
that was my thinking as well, just sweep it intt another wallet and be done with it. but like you said kinda risky, so id rather wait then lose coin cause im inpatient. 
wallet is breadwallet for IOS
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:47:14
Already got a ticket open with them. Was hoping someone on the community knew the answer.

It’s really quite bananas how the current charts match the chart on the left of it.

bitcoin blocks have a hard limit(artificially capped) at 1 megabyte. from the image above,those blocks have been basically filled to the 1 megabyte limit. so any transaction that is pending to be confirmed will have to wait for the next block that has space in order for it to be confirmed. 
also since blocks are starting to fill up, we can see that the fee associated with sending bitcoin will start to rise and transactions with a higher fee attached to them have a higher priority to be included in the current block.

actually they did. cell phones, when they were first avaliable, were seen as a luxury item. they were big, clunky, heavy and battery didnt last long. very few people had them and those that did were already popular in popular culture. iPads had the iphone to help it along, but even the iphone had some help. apple was the cool, and still is, company. making cool products and if you didnt have an apple product you just werent cool. shit there was even a report done when iphones first came out that people with iphones had an easier chance of getting laid. but even the iphone had its issues. 
before the iphone came out there was a bunch of touch screen phones, they all sucked. trust me i used 1 from verizon and it blew donkey cock. the main difference between the iphone and other touch screen phones was that it just worked. you wanna make a phone cal, touch the phone icon that you already know what it is and then type in the number like you usually do. 
now the main difference between Bitcoin and say the iphone is that,  the iphone was super intuitive to use from the moment it was unboxed. bitcoin is not. yes its a lot easier to use today then back in 2010, but it still is difficult.
in order to use bitcoin properly and not worry about losing any of your coins is to make sure your security is super tight, not just on your wallet, but your PC. also make sure not to click on any links you dont know. there is alot of things that have to happen in order for someone to feel secure with their coins. thats the biggest issue. people feel like they need to become it security experts to use bitcoin. but all of that is being worked on right now and soon itll be a story we tell at the bar after a few drinks.

the idea of bitcoin has been around for a while. a couple people experimented with similar ideas. but bitcoin is literally the first one to gather all those ideas and make them work. as for having any prior knowledge, i would have to guess that maybe they had an idea that something would eventually get created to work in conjunction with the 402 status code. if anything it was more of a twinkle in the eye at the point then an actual fleshed out idea

i dont know man, i work for a company that just finished a funding round of 30MM. and it took us almost 9 months for that. it takes alot of work to get funding and you have to answer alot of questions. there is alot of minute(my-nute) details they get obsessed over in a funding round, and while yes it is possible for a cojpany to get funded that is vaporware, you dont get 100MM+ in funding if you dont have a clear cut business plan. 
on a personal note. im pretty sure these giys not only know what there are building, but are keeping it on the down low on purpose. the people of BTC love a mystery.

send 1-time payment to service provider with the CLTV to a "Pot". then have the service provider check block height date to see if the block height date is equal to date of billing, if it is then only the amount due for the subscription for that month is moved from the pot to the wallet of the service provider?
