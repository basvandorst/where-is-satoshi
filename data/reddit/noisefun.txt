ha ha, well what are you waiting for, go buy some and tip me :p

Thanks, I understand the divisions, it was a rhetorical question....


Go out on the street and ask people what division micro and nano are.




Yes I understand it is 'no different' but we have a common and widespread system already in use for money, why not leverage exactly the same system for bitcoin and make its adoption easier to understand for everyone.

I think you misread me, I meant that it is technically possible for a computer to make a mistake when copying / pasting.
You are absolutely right though, streamlined apps, NFC and mobile systems are the solutions, the current problem is that it is very new public technology that most people either don't have on their mobile device....or don't know they have it on their mobile device. Let alone know what to do with it or how to use it.

No problem!
They work with an escrow system also.
Just watch out, if you keep money in their system (a week i think) you will get charged a storage fee, so transfer to your main wallet after buying.

Yea, but where does that leave us when 1 satoshi = 1$? there are too many 0's and decimal places to work from the top down. Eg - the Zimbabwean dollar.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:21:12
yea, I have been arguing this point for a long time now. Everyone inside bitcoin is so heavily invested and knowledgeable in technology that current digital security and wallet systems are easy and simple to them. Ask them about simplifying the system or making wallets and payments more user friendly and all you get is a barrage of "it is simple already" // "why wouldnt anyone understand it" etc etc...
the community desperately needs to look outside its box or bitcoin will have a lot of trouble with adoption...as it currently does. If you dont 'know' and trust tech at the moment, it is near impossible to get into bitcoin.

Yea I like the audacity of Dogecoin and its appeal to a much younger market. I mostly agree that it will never see 'real' value or use to the level of bitcoin, primarily because: no one takes it seriously, its somewhat racist, merchants will never pickup on a 'joke' currency etc.
I'm keen to promote it and see where it goes socially, as you said, it could easily become karma 2.0 or something similar.
That said, I have looked around and I still have no idea how I am supposed to get hold of Dogecoins, is it only through tipping?

Label your axes, your graph is meaningless.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:17:24
Localbitcoins or bitbargain.co.uk (if you are in the UK) seem to be the main sources.

Well - Why would you keep much money in your bitcoin-tip wallet anyway? Equally, would you walk around the street with a load of money in your pocket?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:29:24
Yea, I like the blockchain 'bank' for small amounts &amp; the paper wallet for large amounts. But, from the perspective of normal people, what do you do with the paper wallet? put it in your bank? Hide it under your bed? How is it more secure?
And QR codes... Yes, they are convenient, but I can count on one finger the number of times I've ever used a QR code and most people dont have any idea what they are or what to do with them, even though they have been in general use for quite a few years now. (This is not to say that that bitcoin wont be the medium that makes QR codes a success, but why would it since no one else has been able to make QR codes work yet?)

oh, I have not looked at selling yet - I just took a quick look, it does not look easy to sell there. Any tips on converting Bitcoins to £ then?
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:18:44
Ah yes, payday is becoming bitcoin day for many!

Best time to buy was an amount of time ago, second best time to buy is right now.
It's still so speculative and high risk at the moment, no one can predict movement up or down. If you keep waiting for it to drop before you buy...it might never happen. If you buy now, it might drop and crash completely tomorrow.
We *can* encourage takeup and use of bitcoins, which should increase its value, but more importantly it will make their spending use widespread and common and (hopefully) eventually level that price out as they become common currency.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:28:48
Oh I know, but SI units are not common to currency at all. Why not stick with the same system that everyone is familiar with?

Ohm would like a word with you.
[edit - Sorry, you are right...you said 'prefix'. Its too early in the morning! Ohm would not like a word with you]
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:43:18
Ah yes, assuming value gets that high, you are right. The system would then work from the ground up in standard monetary denominations.

This raises an interesting point about bitcoin transactions and something I think could scare off 'normal' people.
The address system is really really un friendly in terms of interaction design. This is a key example of just how un readable the addresses are. They are impossible to remember or write down and have to be copied / pasted between locations.
I know there is the 'request payment' system, but what happens when I want to pay someone without them contacting me first?
There seems to be far to much room for human error, why do we not have human-readable / rememberable addresses or a simplification of this system?

ten thousand, Based on the lowest subdivision (satoshi) being 1.

check out bitbargain.co.uk, you effectively pay a small percent in fees but the market seems good and reliable. Used it a few times myself, very quick easy sales.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:08:02
Ah ok. Thanks, I'm not fully informed with everything bitcoin, so I was hoping someone had a existing solution to my issue.
The double check you mention is very useful - But I presume you mean it will be in the form of 'are you sure you want to do this' or it will show you the address of the transaction and ask you to confirm? This still doesn't solve the problem or make it as simple as as system (a very crude example) where you have a name and a &lt;10 digit number or something human-readable / rememberable.
Eg. If I want a friend to transfer money to my bank account i give them my name, acc number and sort code, all easily memorable. I don't need to be near a computer. How does this work with bitcoin if he does not already have my address? I have to have a computer to hand to send him a request or send him my address? Secondly, even if I end him my address for payment, he could very easily miss-type it or the computer could cause an error in copy / pasting it resulting in an error.
Or am I looking at the problem in the wrong way?
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:41:01
I see what you mean, but I think it is an issue....and I'm not in the US!
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:04:07
Well the top down denominations and naming in bitcoin is really confusing for 'normal' people. 
How much is a microbitcoin? What division of 1 bitcoin is that? In real money we have hundreds, thousands etc I know they ar ewell established, but they are also commonplace for numbers.
Why are we forcing such a different system for bitcoins? Why not simplify the diversification and accessibility  and go with common naming standards?
