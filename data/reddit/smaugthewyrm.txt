Um, yes we are. I understand (and wholeheartedly agree) that volatility is bad for adoption of the currency. Unfortunately, many people in this sub use BTC as an investment medium. That's bad for the currency, but that doesn't negate the fact that even if BTC loses 75% of it's value today it is still higher than it was 6 months ago.

Yep. The good news is that even if it loses 75% of its value, we're still ahead of where we were 6 months ago.

You, sir, deserve ALL the internets.

That may be the most insightful thing I've ever read on the Internet. I tip my hat to you, sir.

Y'know, I thought you were a smug jackass at first, but this comment changed my mind (mom is in remission from cancer). You're alright.

Ive already decided to get into BTC. I consider my $100 lost. Right now it's simply a matter of trying to maximize how many BTC that $100 gets converted into. In your more experienced opinion, which is more likely, a market correction, or continued upward growth? Thanks!

That's how I felt at $100. Bought .333 BTC at $180 right before the April crash. Glad I did now.

Note the use of the word "opinion."

I saw that, and am kicking myself for not buying in at $61 the other day. So what is the daily trend like? Are they cheapest in the morning, with prices rising as the day goes on? At what point do prices for that day drop again? Thanks! :)

I understand the risks, and consider the money gone. But I would much rather it be lost to market volatility than to some scumbag with keylogging software. Thanks for your time! :)

I agree. I've read about the value crash in summer 2011, &amp; I do think that there will be significant value drops. 
What I wonder though, is will it drop from $75 to $30, or will it continue to rise, reaching, say, $135 before dropping down to $85, with that being the "horrific crash?" Whichever scenario has the greater likelihood of occurring, while impossible to know definitively, is what I'm concerned with. 
I know people can't see the future, but they can make educated guesses, and that's what I'm seeking. :)

I agree, and it makes me sad.

Yep. They send the Icarus 2, some twitchy guy forgets to adjust the shield, cap'n dies, everyone panics, then some sun-poisoned psychopath from the Icarus 1 starts butchering everyone like sheep before Cillian Murphy and the lovely Rose Byrne nuke the sun to end the solar winter.
Spoiler Alert.

I realize that this was an ironic post, but some people's mothers do indeed have cancer, so in the interest of compassion, can you please use examples that aren't about terminal illnesses? Thank you for your time.
