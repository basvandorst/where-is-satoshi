Binance is safe at the moment. Just don't fall for phishing and of course have 2FA enabled

I've seen the exact thing somewhere before. I mean word for word. It's nothing to worry about. You're welcome and stay safe

Fits in snugly

I like the way that they think

I haven't read too much into the case compared to you. It's a very interesting point that you present. 
But is it as implausible as the US government using him as a patsy? Did they not catch him logged into the site? Just like they did with Ross. If that's correct, he wasn't a very clever man. Learned no lesson from others previous mistakes.

It's not so strange. Bribes are very common where he was living 
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:48:40
Because why buy high, when you can buy low?

If you never had 2fa enabled then it's probably down to you.

What's with the formatting?

She's a fucking bellend

I've seen this written somewhere before. It's just some elaborate scam. Check the address to see if anyone else has transfered coin into it. But definitely just ignore it

Lmao. Sounds legit
