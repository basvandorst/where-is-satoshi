Decentralized exchanges are important but there hasn't been an efficient one so far. Having options of centralized exchanges is not bad either. You just don't want to have all your assets on those exchanges.

You should look at Samourai Wallet. I think it's one of the best mobile wallets out there. Individual key, privacy features, easy UI/UX. Hopefully it stays that way and with Boltzmann and stonewall, it's improving fungibility.
It's a recommended wallet from Andreas too so it says something.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:08:43
Great. If you can get Privacy, Security, and Easy UX, I think the wallet can be a success. Although easier said than done. haha
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:45:17
Does USD produce anything? Does holding Gold produce anything? 
I think the idea that asset needs to produce something is a one-sided argument. Bitcoin is for censorship-resistant and secure money for long term.
As the Financial structure continues to head downwards, Bitcoin is one of the best solution to the problem. At least that's the way I see it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:22:39
What do they produce?
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:45:42
We don't know what goes on behind the scenes. 
Bitcoin produces financial privacy and security. It might not be tangible but it's something that no other asset has. And a farm does not produce food; you need people, right location, knowledge in farming, right season, and market, to sell your produce. It's not that easy. 
All I'm saying is that there is a increasing demand for Bitcoin and crypto. As people increasingly value financial privacy and security, more will be attracted as a result.

Check out Andreas Antounopoulos. He's one of the most informed person in the Bitcoin space. Don't follow him blindly but take in all the information you can and decide for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:01:23
There is 2^160 possible wallet addresses out there. Common sense should be enough to know why.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:49:06
Dividends are negligible unless you heavily invest. If you compare Bitcoin's growth over the last 9 years to dividend stocks, you can see the big difference.
And the fact that crypto is only valued at what other person pays at is weakened when the demand is in the multi-billions.
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:05:13
That's it. Except there's tax involved (depending on your location) + uncertainty in price (although we all know it's headed to the moon).
You would have to know when Bitcoin was going to at 10K and 20K. It could be at 10K one day and 1K another day. Can you hold onto 90% drop and wait til it goes to 20K? No one knows so it's always wild.
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:13:52
Hardware wallets are the best options but if you only have a small holding, you can try desktop wallets like Exodus. Also, Samourai wallet on android is a good option as well. 
Whatever wallet you use, the most important thing to do is secure your private key. If you expose your private key to anyone/anywhere/hacks, you're funds are gone forever. That's why hardware wallets are the best because you don't expose the private key anywhere. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:11:46
Any country can use their power to take anything. They're state some reason why and execute them. 
I have no problem with taxes. It is what it is.
Also, it's not only Bitcoin that is based the next man. Every asset/anything of value has supply and demand. Bitcoin is about censor-ship resistant and secure values. If you dont find that valuable, you won't pay to get one. I don't find farms valuable so I won't pay a fortune to get a farm. And so on.
Ultimately, if you don't see any value in Bitcoin, don't buy it. Just don't regret when Bitcoin goes up in price exponentially.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:56:33
But you said stocks. Stocks don't produce anything. 
Farm takes a lot of resources/people/knowledge. And it can be taken away from you. No one can take away your Bitcoin if you take good secure measures and only takes some technical sense to buy it.
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:18:15
If you're going to invest into Bitcoin, I would suggest to figure out why. If the only reason is because it's popular and a get rich quick idea, you're gonna have a bad time.
Learning is half the battle. Read through the Bitcoin whitepaper or watch Andreas Antounopolis's videos or go through BiteSizeBitcoin's B90X. Figure out why it's popular and why you're going to invest in.
Personally, I think it's a revolutionary idea and a macroeconomic change for the future. It can fail but I highly doubt it. 
And to start, you should put in a little bit at a time. Maybe saving your luxury/entertainment money and putting into Bitcoin. Anyway have fun. It'll change your life.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:14:11
What do you see as better investment that produces something of value?
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:52:12
Bitcoin produces an asset that only you can control. Whether you own USD, Gold, Stocks, or Farm, it can be taken away from you. If the government deems that they deserve your belongings, they will have it done. They cannot with Bitcoin if you have secure measures.
@_date: 2018-05-25 06:38:20
Because Bitcoin has been proved for years and continues to be valuable. Other altcoins have not proved themselves and are more speculative.
It's like saying why invest in Amazon/Apple when you have so many others like ebay/yahoo/penny stocks? 
It's just an analogy, not exact representation.
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:09:09
True. Check with your local tax laws.
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:26:59
Yes. what I'm saying is that wallet supply is almost infinite. One person can have a million wallets if they chose to. you can't set the metric for that.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:53:18
Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not... anyways, hope you enjoy your stay. And go get yourself a hardware wallet if you're serious about crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:46:41
No one knows but I think it'll be 4.5K. Might even be 3.5K. eh
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:01:07
It may be a server issue or a hack. But the lesson is that web wallets are still more insecure than hardware wallets. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:05:20
Agreed. Buy the Dips!
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:43:31
Sorry dude. Tough mistake. But as long as you have evidence of it as a loss, you can possibly write that off. Talk to your accountant and see. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:29:50
I would sell the BTC to pay the dept off. BTC is a savings for me and I cannot save while having a dept of 17% apr. Then slowly buy in. This can be the worse option but it's definitely safer than your dept growing. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:47:33
I think it will but it might take a while. Maybe next year or maybe next 5 years. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:25:11
There's plenty of hacks and incidents with web wallets. 
Lesson is to use a hardware wallet if you're serious about investing in Bitcoin. Otherwise, you're taking the risk of getting hacked even if it's not your fault.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:29:04
Bitcoin and Crypto are volatile. They might be down 20% one day and up 50% another. I would just hold but if you need the money quick, sell them.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:35:46
Funny. FUDDER you have no power here!
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:37:09
Bitcoin has been going through a bear market. Personally, I think it's close to the bottom but I could be wrong as well. It's your choice at the end.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:41:13
I thought you were arrested.
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:31:46
Alright. Well, Trezor is a great choice and always keep your security a first priority. Doesn't matter how much you buy and hold if you get scammed/hacked. 
And read a lot. Bitcoin is a beast in it of itself. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:39:29
The dip isn't over but neither is my buying. :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:23:43
The market is not predictable but for me, the general sentiment is still bearish. I think Bitcoin has to go under 6k and go through panic selling until majority comes back into a strong support. Or we'll just have a boring and gradual decrease into 6k or lower. Who knows but I still got the strong hands!
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:27:25
Bitcoin will bottom when majority says it will die. I think we'll getting pretty close but let's give it more time. Meanwhile, Buy the Dip!
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:18:39
Volatility and Fees. But it's only a disadvantage to amateurs and short term traders. For HODlers, it's just a part of the game.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:29:25
If you know why you're investing into Bitcoin and you see the long term store of value in it, I see why not.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:38:07
It depends on you. If you think Bitcoin has a long term value over the ATH, it's good to buy the dips. If you think Bitcoin is worthless, why would you buy more? 
People are accumulating while others sell. It's your decision in the end.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:43:30
It's not over yet. We still have a long way to go. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:12:21
No doubt it will get worse. We just have to make the best out of the situation or move to another country.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:39:29
Yes. This hard fork was going to ruin some people's lives and it was a very good call to cancel.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:41:46
Not sure why Korea is pumping bcash. -_-
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:05:44
If you have $1000 in crypto, you need to get a hardware wallet. Need. not an option. you need to.
I would say if you have more than $200-300, getting a hardware wallet is necessary. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:38:02
Congratulations! Taking out profit is never a bad idea. I hope everything works out with your house and there's always more opportunities waiting for you!
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:52:55
It is done for the good of the country but I do think it's excessive at times. I am hoping for less tax rules with cryptocurrency because it's a decentralized system that the government should not profit from.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:01:45
Do not trust anyone with your Bitcoin. Once you send, it's gone.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:51:53
The Standard wallets will be illogical to use. Why pay more fees and be inefficient? You can probably still use some in the future but it's a lot better to upgrade to Segwit.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:30:34
Congrats! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:04:42
Agreed. Some of the best developers in the space is a plus.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:15:45
With a cup of coffee in my hand. Tis but a scratch.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:26:36
Basically, buy the dip. I like it. haha
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:07:22
More Exchanges join in, the better. Segwit is the way to go.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:49:39
Didn't you write the words on the provided mnemonic paper slip? How did you only get 23 words?
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:10:31
Sometimes the worst enemy is yourself. Don't make it so hard that you lose your own key. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 03:46:33
Because not everywhere accepts crypto. And you can store your wealth in crypto while spending some for necessary purchases. But when you hold fiat, you lose in inflation while still spending the same.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:19:59
Get yourself a Hardware wallet. It costs like 70-100 USD and if you're invested more than that, I would definitely get one. Either a Ledger Nano S or Trezor. Also, make sure the mnemonic phrases are empty to start; some people scam others by sending pre-filled recovery phrases.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:05:12
I made a video on that. Hope it helps. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:47:10
Personally, I think Dollar cost averaging is one of the best ways to invest into Bitcoin and crypto. The disciplined investing kept me through some tough times. And especially during a bear market, it's a lot easier to keep up the DCA.
