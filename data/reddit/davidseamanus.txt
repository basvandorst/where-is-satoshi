hey, I know this guy
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:25:06
That was beautiful, you've put into words some of my views on the community and its potential.
@_date: 2014-01-22 07:52:45
oh no! he was super nice, actually everyone there was really nice and friendly to me &amp; the other guest - cool to see that. some networks give zero fucks about the guest having a good experience (cough cough fox)
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:13:24
Andreas is great - he'll actually be on my podcast in two days (the 17th) - watched one of his lectures on YouTube today, has an amazing gift with words / conveying ideas.
edit- and Stefan Molyneux will actually be the guest on my show two days after that. it's as if you've read my mind :)

Fun to watch this because what was "obvious" in 1981, but people still couldn't really accept, was that networked computers - the Internet - would overtake everything. Even the unchallenged powerful newspapers and television networks.
Similar kind of feeling today, as we're seeing the early signs that networked wallets - Bitcoin - will overtake some previous financial systems.

Aside from the 39.1% increase in downloads, some other data: tip amounts varied widely, with three tips above 0.01 BTC. Also, the switch to an ad-free model sparked a bunch of people asking how to 'load' bitcoin so they could tip the show.
My dream is to continue doing the show supported only by tips, and then present a more complete data set to other popular podcasters in the L.A. area and try to convince them to do the same!
I think sponsorship is an establishment media model, and with frictionless micro-tips a reality now, it is actually possible for the audience to support the content - rather than the audience's attention being sold to an advertiser.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:22:31
paying multiple times -&gt; higher rank is good, in my opinion, because it adds a "social voting" element to search results. If some truly great article about Bitcoin should be above a bunch of mainstream media silliness, it will rise as more people part ways with a very small amount of BTC in exchange for seeing that article rise in results.
This is a way to increase Bitcoin's demand by an order of magnitude.
And as for your other questions... that's why this is a white napkin idea. Hopefully it will spark some smart people to play around and come up with something.

if you can't or don't want to listen via iTunes, here's a direct audio file of the interview: 
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:16:49
Btw- If this makes you as insanely happy as it makes me, PLEASE do yourself a favor and listen to the last episode of my podcast. I had on a charismatic Bitcoin exchange CEO who sounds like he has his shit together much more so than Karpeles. And they're based in the US.
Also, please consider picking up a copy of USA Today! It will have historical value, and if they get a huge boost in sales it's a nice way of reminding them Bitcoin stories = readers. And nice way of rewarding them for positive straightforward press, instead of the Newsweek treatment. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:28:39
cool, thanks! cheers! (bit early for the beer, but I'll have one later today)
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:44:01
this is fairly huge - I used BOND when I was living in NYC to find an apartment rental (and their broker fee is pretty hefty). They have numerous offices, pretty well known among apartment rental hunters in the city.
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:00:17
posting this because I heard from several people on here that the audio quality of our podcast was less than ideal (that was due to an issue on my end, Skype-in interviews don't sound as good as they could yet). This video relies on another recording and is much easier to listen to. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:21:17
two more points-
these kinds of videos go viral, people love visualized data, and would be an easy way for existing bitcoin users to show their Facebook/twitter friends what bitcoin is about. 
also, would be cool to see people making Bitcoin 'commercials' - similar to a bank commercial spot. Someone paying for their coffee with bitcoin in a brightly lit San Francisco coffee shop, smiling as they hold their partner's hand on a Caribbean cruise paid for with bitcoin, etc. Then fading out to the Bitcoin logo and some kind of slogan, "Controlled by no one. Accepted by anyone. Bitcoin." and maybe plug bitcoin.org so people can choose a wallet. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:59:30
It's called Bitcoin, have you heard of it? Good merchant acceptance, strong miner network...
@_date: 2014-01-22 03:18:51
That is my name, don't wear it out. :)
edit- and thanks whoever submitted this, despite the sensational sounding title I think bitcoin does have the potential to be a global currency standard similar to the pound sterling, or the US dollar after Bretton Woods... consequently, early adopters who own significant % of this global standard will gain a lot of purchasing power (relative to falling fiat currencies). I think even some early adopters fail to realize how staggering this shift could end up being.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:43:13
ways to listen-
 - online streaming link
 - iTunes or the iOS Podcasts app
the podcast is also available on all other major podcast apps, such as pocket casts, etc. the Stitcher app is great on Android. the podcast is free *everywhere*, if someone is trying to charge you or paywall to access my show they're scamming you! thanks
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:57:17
you might want to look into mining Vertcoin, I believe it's still profitable for gpu miners - you can ask there also!
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:44:29
they're an exchange like BTC-E or Bitstamp, not a reseller that sources their coins from the exchanges and then sells at a small markup, as I believe coinbase does.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:56:54
 if you have any questions for her.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:18:48
Shit forgot to put his name in the title: Stefan Molyneux.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:03:35
They gave away shovels and denim jeans for free during the gold rush? Cool.
edit: lol downvotes to teh moonz for joking. guess my dry podcaster sarcasm doesn't come across well in reddit comments
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:48:06
"I'll post the link to this PDF within the next week from my Twitter and Google+ accounts."
I think that fits the description of soon.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:42:26
yes you can.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:58:21
Thanks brother, encourage you to do better. That's not sarcasm. The more ideas and analysis of this stuff, the better!
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:43:30
Also, if anyone else is an early adopter or miner who has stuck with it through the ups and downs, it'd be great to get your story published in the PDF version of the book. If you want your story published, please explicitly state in your comment that I have permission to publish it (a non-exclusive, non-commercial license).
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:26:54
What does this mean? Sorry, I understand CC licensing but not these distinctions. I'm distributing the PDF version for free, I want it to be distributed freely, republished, remixed, want people to do whatever they want with it in any way whatsoever.
Hardly going to be sending people takedown notices.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:16:51
Thank you! I think Amazon looks a lot at frequency, especially when a title is now. Between my iTunes podcast and Twitter I have a pretty big crowd of people who like the projects I do, so that sudden influx of interest for sure probably helped a bit..
edit: another response where everyone thinks I'm a huge asshole. here's a better answer: **I don't know, ask me when I see my Kindle royalty report.**
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:42:45
That's totally cool. Thanks! My address for tips related to this work is **16b2Gzf8U3DtBvucSkktaKytg8V9xLpUgh**
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:55:03
oh yeah! and 1hr, 38 minutes in I give a passionate on-air explanation of why I believe in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:13:25
Thanks buddy! Just retweeted you.
And yes definitely - the PDF version will be longer, and future updates/revisions will be offered for free as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:18:15
Rad! Thanks man
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:11:12
Thanks! For sure, please check my public Twitter feed about one week from today for the download link. I'll post it to this thread also.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:14:14
oh yes, I know :) Last time I was in England I got the celebrity treatment. Every store clerk: "did you know you have the same name as--" me: Yup, well aware.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:23:09
Believe the Kindle version offers text-to-speech as long as the reader is using a supported Kindle model.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:04:00
that is the plan. I very much enjoy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:55:59
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:51:37
Appreciate that! :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:46:34
Thank you! Informing friends and co-workers about BTC is precisely the purpose of this release so I'm very happy to hear that!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:52:45
Awesome! Thanks much :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:04:19
I'd encourage people to put the PDF up on bittorrent when it comes out.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:25:29
the original white paper, and bitcointalk.org every day are probably good required reading :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:22:10
correctemundo! was just being playful, I'm normally pretty sarcastic, shouldn't have expected it to come across and using the sarcasm tag is just lame

First 3 minutes of ep 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:07:55
You're welcome, thank YOU for putting it under CC. Been a fan of CC licensed work for a long time.
Fyi, you're linked at the end of the Kindle version of the book so people can click through directly to your Flickr account. In the PDF version, I will make sure your credit is even more prominent. If you have a BTC address you'd like me to include, happy to publish that below your credit as well :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:44:06
Thanks for pointing this out! When someone was explaining password security to me, they suggested I 'salt' my password and used the term in this way - so my bad! Will correct it in the next edition. :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:27:36
Thanks! I'm pretty busy hosting my show in LA so no plans to become the Bitcoin support guy, but I've seen some horrific stories of losing coins both here and on BitcoinTalk that could have been *very* easily avoided had the people read any decent book on the subject beforehand, understood the basics of wallet security.
Hoping the book will be a stand-alone thing. Going to add more content to the PDF version about security, importance of multiple backups, etc.
Good question. That's up to you. I think at this point buying the book actually helps more - the longer it stays at  the more Kindle users in those categories will be exposed to it. But I am certainly not going to say no to sweet, sweet BTC (edit: and I do need to pay the designer, she won't work for free).
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:08:21
The book was published only a few days ago. I am sure more reviews will come in over the next week!
Also, you don't need to take my word for it. Just check the rankings, Amazon updates it every few hours.
edit- there's another review on the Amazon UK edition.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:47:01
This is awesome! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:45:11
This is an aspect of human psychology, I'd think, and pretty universal - we remember the past in increasingly more optimistic terms, and regret taking on as many challenges as possible.
Don't beat yourself up. To put this a simple way, Bitcoin wasn't Bitcoin back in 2010. Exchanges were kinda shady, answers were sometimes hard to come by, the wallet clients weren't as refined.
Sort of like turning down an opportunity to be employee  or  at Google or Twitter. Why would any sane person do that? Well, plenty did. At the time, Google wasn't Google. And Twitter was a SMS chatty kind of service that would have seemed at the time like an interesting social gimmick, not the next $20 billion company.
We can only make the next right choice in the present, and then the next right choice, the next right choice after that, and so on.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:24:47
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:31:10
Excellent, thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:05:50
thanks! think it comes out to something like 17 cents per page, less than a fax. I could have made it longer with references, table of contents, etc. just didn't give a fuck - keep it concise so as many people as possible can understand what BTC's about.
The free PDF version coming out next week will be longer, and the designer I'm using does beautiful work. Will post the link here next week!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:27:45
I want the book to be modified, distributed, commercially or non-commercially (i.e. if someone can make a buck reselling my free PDF, more power to them)... and ideally maybe read! :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:05:44
Alright forward-thinking crypto geniuses, have to bounce. Enjoyed answering questions on here, this is one of my favorite subreddits to lurk and learn from - lot of great people here.
Will be back in a week to post the finished PDF.
I chose not to reply to some of the more negative comments because I think the negative 'trollness' of them is self-evident: 1) not my job to convince you why Bitcoin is valuable, if you don't get it, don't use it... different strokes for different folks. I don't care.
2) the money is for the designer to make the PDF look beautiful, it's not for me, and you're correct in assuming I have enough BTC. I bought long before the November boom. (no one has enough, but you know what I mean.)
cheers everyone!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:15:45
Your skepticism is completely warranted, thanks for suggesting this! Will tweet out a verification now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:50:03
No good deed goes unpunished. I'll report to the firehouse immediately to burn these "books."
Seriously though, thank you for the feedback - granted, could have been packaged in a friendlier way, but thank you for it - this is an inaccuracy and it will be fixed in the next edition.
Looked through your comment history briefly and it's an astonishing cauldron of anti-Bitcoin hatred. *Why?* Did Bitcoin bone your mom or something?
I know nothing about you, but allow me to assume you're someone who did research on BTC and came to the conclusion it wasn't going anywhere. Your hypothesis has been proven wrong hundreds of times since then as Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, but you cling to the hypothesis. This doesn't make you a bad person. Doesn't make you an unintelligent person. But it does make you someone clinging onto an invalidated hypothesis and shitting on another person's work.
Even though you seem to believe that books cannot contain opinion or conjecture, I think the opposite is clearly true, and would encourage you to write *your own book* or post a YouTube video sharing the major issues you have with digital currency. Real debate of ideas, rather than ad hominem attacks and calling my work "drivel" and implying that it's a mainstay of my income (even though it went up just this morning, and is free), are not the hallmarks of a relaxed environment for discussion.
There's also no need for anger when discussing something as intriguing as digital currencies. I enjoy reading about this stuff, learning from it, and sharing my views on it. Others may have different views. 
When an argument comes from a place of anger and hatred, it can be a sign that the ego is driving your rhetoric. Highly recommend the free Ram Dass lecture "Ram Dass on Ego" - it's on YouTube and probably elsewhere. Life changing bit of knowledge... as someone who used to be quite negative to others, and who still battles that urge, highly recommend!
TL;DR thanks for the feedback, although you could have just said "hey man, that part should say 'less than $0.01' instead of 'as little as $0.01.'"

@_date: 2013-12-01 17:17:26
This is something I would gladly answer if I could. Amazon's rankings are, as far as I can tell, relational and not absolute. Therefore the # to become a bestseller one week is not the same as another week.
As for specific number of copies, I can give this number tomorrow or Tuesday. Kindle doesn't update sales data in real time.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:01:02
