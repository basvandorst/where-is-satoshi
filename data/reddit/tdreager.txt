Wrong. USD is not the only currency there is.

Exactly. Bitcoin has been well above all time high for ages in many countries.

Industrialisation of mining wrecks the elegance of bitcoin.

Once one, or all of these things happen, does everyone just stop using bitcoin altogether, forever?  I'm not sure... I think there's an underlying basic demand, which will fuel recovery from crashes.

The problem here, that I'm surprised you don't see, is that you can apply the argument to any future blockchain as well. The argument you seem to be making is to never adopt anything, because there is always the possibility of newer and better technology. I don't think this makes much practical sense.

And the comparison to bitcoin is... we can live without it? Like we can live without fiat? The 'intrinsic value' argument is only ever rolled out to say that fiat has intrinsic value, bitcoin doesn't. If you're defining intrinsic value to mean something that is necessary for life, than neither bitcoin nor fiat has that.

Depends what you're talking about. What about the imperial system, or fiat currency. The trend of being  can mean much in the long run, MySpace and Netscape aren't necessarily accurate comparisons. The bitcoin protocol can be updated to incorporate tech of newer coins. The bitcoin protocol doesn't have to be perfect, just adequate.  As soon as it's adequate, there's no clear incentive for everyone to migrate to a different protocol instead of banking on the existing platform. The things you've listed all have glaring reasons why being top dog doesn't in and of itself make them top dog in the long run.

True. But let us dwell on this particular occasion for a moment.
