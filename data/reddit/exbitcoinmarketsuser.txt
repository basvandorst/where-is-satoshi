The arbitrator (developer) may request two forms of National Photo Identification in phase 2 of a dispute. They may also request Skype interviews and other privacy impositions. Good luck if you are someone or trading from somewhere for which obtaining the required identity documents might mean risking your life. If disputed you default at phase 2, your counter-party may be aware of this even if you aren't.
There is as yet no decentralised DAO with tokens at stake for arbitrators, no policy on how these identity documents are stored  or any of the type of systems which would be required to *trust* that the developer isn't working against your interests when it comes to engagement with government actors.
They might be good people and might be trying but I'm not going to stop harping on about this and start parroting that they're *"decentralised'* like everyone else.
We need to be uncompromising in demanding decentralised solutions for on-ramps which resist censorship by the state, instead of building them on the foundation of state identity databases.

Unless disputed and Phase 1 fails to resolve it.
 Phase 2
 Real life ID verification


After that the arbitrator will request a video session via any commonly used and freely available video conference tool (Skype, Hangout, Tox...) and ask the trader to show both documents and also to show his face so the arbitrator can compare with the photo and the scans. Sufficiently good resolution should be selected for the video call to allow verification.

They did have language in the policy which made it clear their thinking was that a scammer wouldn't provide ID and therefore their phase 2 would quickly discover the fraudulent party.
Now as it stands I think Phase 2 is akin to *"Well, we just don't like the look of ya, you look dodgy compared to the other guy, nah you both look dodgy, fuck it we'll just keep the wallet locked"*
This phrase 2 is largely untested, but to my eyes is full of holes and too greater risk.

One total, possibly two, though it's unclear. Apparently the main developer and maybe one other core team member.

Seems that way and I believe one reason why there is no liquidity on their system. Too much country-party risk for what should be a decentralised system where trust and permission isn't required.
They did re-word that bit about ID meaning that you're legit and instead stating something more like it's impossible for them to resolve a dispute. It seems that the policy is now to just leave the escrow locked forever.

Same issue. Though probably worse. There is only 1 arbitrator in the system, the DAO they talk about with staked tokens at risk isn't done.
They demand two forms of National Photo Identification as part of Phase 2 of dispute resolution. During this phase the single arbitrator looks at the IDs and according to their documents (before it was re-worded) this provision of  identification is considered to be proof that you are not a scammer. As a scammer wouldn't send their ID, apparently.

That's how a mobile alpha version send-only LN wallet will function today. Currently there are no live *channel factory* implementations that I know of, while Elltoo (which greatly improves channel factories) requires a softfork update to the protocol.

Server logs are private. You could use Google analytics which is trusted far beyond any of these old counter scripts. Counter scripts were always just about getting code onto as many pages as possible. They have a long history of being exploited or themselves being malicious.
Honestly your users should be blocking these with a browser extension anyway.

It's probably not the right UX to implement yet. You could make a LN withdrawal but it is not really any different to any other type of withdrawal and delivers few benefits while taking development time and having associated risk. Along the way you need to support the users who have questions about it's use.
Some have enough reason to do this already, such as `livingroomofsatoshi.com` who can offer yet another way to interact with their system.
What would make this worth implementing is Eltoo and off-chain channel factories. 
When the exchange can design a system where they are able to on-ramp people without on-chain transactions this will gradually gain ground as being a competitive advantage for the exchange. Especially during next bullrun when transaction volumes peak and capacity to on-board new customers becomes fully utilised.
Then the bottleneck again becomes staffing for KYC validations on these new customers.
