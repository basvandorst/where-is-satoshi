Yes that's right.  I have a script that scans the blockchain and looks out for repeated r values in signatures.  There are only about 330 million signatures in the blockchain :) You can't do it by hand, of course, but checking for bad r values with a computer is feasible.

I noticed some transactions in March (from 8th-20th) with very weak random numbers in the signatures.  This compromised over 80 keys.  Could this be related?  One of the compromised addresses is 1Ergm8bZPLfihAtcwwf5sACzm3qEqSsRYM
Contact me, if that is the case.  I just setup a bot that sweeps the compromised addresses.

The first one is with an unlimited mempool (well there is a limit of 2GB, but that hasn't been approached yet) and 14 days timeout (although transactions are included after 14 days again if they are rebroadcasted).  Transactions are removed according to opt-in RBF rules, when a conflicting transaction is mined (double spend) and, of course, if the transaction itself is mined.
The second is very close to my statistics of a bitcoin node with default 300 MB mempool:   The number of pending transactions went down dramatically when someone, probably a larger service aggregating its inputs, put large (80-100 kB) transactions with 0.1 BTC fee on the mempool.  Since they are so big, fewer transactions fit in the 300 MB limit (300 MB memory size correspond to 90-140 MB block size).
The last one is probably unlimited mempool, but I think they also count double spends as two transactions.  I'm not sure how the blockchain.info algorithm removes double spends, once the conflicting transactions have been mined.  They also remember transactions that timed out and don't accept them if they are rebroadcasted.

The large mempool server did never run out of memory, but some transactions timed out after 14 days. Usually they are then broadcasted by other nodes and included again; some already timed out twice.  Looking at the historic number of 1-2 fee transactions this could be the case here.  Now that the mempool empties, low fee transactions have a much better chance of getting broadcasted than previously.
But I would say that someone who adds a lot of 2-5 and 1-2 sat/byte transactions really likes cheap transaction :)
To avoid these ugly "glitches" I decided to remove the 14 days timeout for the future.  It looks like the timeout has little effect anyway, due to the regular rebroadcasting that is happening.

It's hard to predict how far it goes this time.  This year 300 MB was only exceeded three times, once in May, once November 13 and once now.  In May it went only slightly above 500 MB, November 13 it stayed below 400 MB. My guess is 2 GB should be enough for the next peak.  That's probably over a million pending transaction.  And I have the memory to go higher, but I would need to restart the node.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:38
How do you know which transactions would not be in the next block?  You can estimate it by assuming the other miners included them in fee order, but they may include a few tx with lower fee.
The likelihood that you waste a whole block reward by doing this is probably too big to be worth the extra fee you make by including them.

Do you mean on the backup server?  The default 300 MB limit was reached yesterday and it is evicting transactions.  I just added an explanation to the website.
The main core node will probably now start evicting transaction, too.  The mempool is at 488 MB and the core node has a 500 MB limit.  The mempool is larger than the chart indicates, since the tx is stored in parsed form in memory, while the chart measures the size of the tx in a block and even subtracts the segwit discount.
I have another server running with 2GB mempool.  I hope that will be enough.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:20:56
Yes, you can see it graphically at   The low fee stripes at the bottom get thrown away when mempool is full and come back when mempool empties.
Note that 300 MB mempool correspond to 90-120 MB of transactions (depending on average transaction size, small transaction have more memory overhead).

The trezor-crypto repository has a small brute-forcer for legacy addresses (provided you know the first receive address). 
It is not the fastest tool (the code is optimized for ARM not for PC) and you would need to adapt it, if the wallet doesn't use bip-44 or you are not sure which address is the very first address.
You also need to provide your own password candidate list.

The mempool is limited to 300 MB by default.  The larger 1sat/byte tx were now removed from the mempool.  Small transactions have larger memory overhead and fill the 300 MB memory quicker.  You can see the effect on 
tl;dr the mempool is full so it can't get larger.  It gets smaller since it contains more small tx, that have more storage overhead.

Schnorr is just a different signature format that allows to combine several signatures with different public keys into a single signature for a combined public key (all signers must cooperate to produce this single signature). This allows compact and hidden multisig (looks exactly like a normal sig) and you can even combine all signatures in a transaction saving a lot of bandwidth for large transactions with many inputs.
Mast allows you to have an output that is spendable by one of multiple possible scripts.  When sending you include the hash of hashes of all scripts (more precisely the Merkle tree root) and when spending you only reveal the script you want to use to spend preserving your privacy. So the main use case are smart contracts.

I don't understand why on the Bitcoin blockchain on-chain scaling seems to be a Taboo now.  The 1000x transactions savings with Lightning seems to be over-optimistic to me; I guess in the beginning it is more like a 5x savings and it may even lead to more transactions overall as it makes Bitcoin more usable.   And Schnorr will also mainly help big services that need to aggregate a lot of small inputs from customers, it will not help the average person so much.
There is a middle ground between putting every micropayment (&lt;10 cent) on-chain and restricting the blocks to a megabyte risking multi-dollar transaction fees.  Unfortunately, nobody seems to pursue this.

You can issue an invoice without having an open lightning channel and ask the person to open a channel to you to pay.  If the person expects to pay you multiple times, it makes sense.  The disadvantage is that it takes at least half an hour for the channel to be established with enough confirmations and only then they can pay you.  
You can also ask around for liquidity on forums, then other big players may open a channel to you.  At the moment it is mostly out of altruistic motives to make lightning a better experience for everyone.  In the future they may want to take profit for routing the payments to you.
Buying bitcoin to setup a Lightning channel doesn't help, since then all bitcoin in the channel belong to you and you cannot receive anything.  But there are some services where you can pay with your lightning bitcoin and they send them back to you with an on-chain transaction.  So after that the channel is still open, but the money is now on the other side and you are ready to receive.
Getting lightning payments is a bit more complicated than getting on-chain payments.  You need to have your node running all the time and you need to issue a separate invoice for every incoming payment.  Without the invoice, nobody can pay you.

Multi-language word list have problems.  If you implement a language in your wallet, then your users cannot use their seed in a different wallet that doesn't support the language.  You want to autodetect the language (and some languages share the same word).  Then there are the problems with how to enter accentuated characters, or Chinese symbols.  The word list should be sorted, but sorted how?  Use byte-representation, or local rules?  Languages like German have even two ways to sort (dictionary or phone book).  If you want best compatibility, just stick to the English wordlist.

They already have the technical ability to sell those bitcoins now and earn $220 for themselves.  It is theft in both cases, if done with intent.

I think the main thing is that if a lightning payment fails, the sender (or his first router in case of a light-lightning-wallet) should automatically open a new direct channel.  This should be integrated in all clients, so that the user doesn't have to do anything, except maybe to confirm the additional fee for opening a channel.  Of course, this means that fees have to be low;  I can't see lightning to work well if there is a 20 $ on-chain fee every time a route fails.
Otherwise paying with lightning is as easy as with a bitcoin wallet.  You set up the wallet, send some funds to it, open one channel to a well-connected node (this may be automized some day), scan a QR-code and confirm the amount.
Receiving donations with lightning is a bit more involved than for bitcoin, as you can't just put a QR-code with your lightning address on your web-site.  Every payment needs a different QR-code and you need a lightning node connected to your web-server.  Receiving payments for digital content should not be more difficult than for bitcoin or credit card; in both cases you need some software that generates invoices and checks for payments to allow downloading the content.  The lightning server will handle the logic of creating invoices and detecting whether the invoice was paid in full.  The confirmation is instantaneous (it takes up to 10 seconds or so, usually less than two). It is even a bit simpler than with bitcoin, where users can under- or overpay.

The problem is that one has to select the termination date when deploying version V and at this time nobody knows when the next fork to version V+1 is necessary.  One could of course choose fixed interval, say a hard fork every 4 years, but then a year before the deadline the developers have to come to a consensus which features should go into the next hard fork.
Another way would be to have a fixed rule that a client for Version V will not check blocks of version V+1 if &gt;=75 % of the last blocks were version V+1, but still accept their transactions.  This way almost everything can be changed by soft forks (new consensus rules are applied by V+1 clients exactly when the 75% limit is reached).
The question is if this is wanted.  This gives miners the power to change the block rewards or to confiscate coins if they can persuade 75 % of the mining power to change.

The number you probably want to hear is about 1500 tx/min.  This is computed from the current transaction mix (see  as follows:
Take segwit size from the spread sheet, divide by number of  transactions to get average segwit transaction size of about 270 byte/tx and compute
    4000000 byte/block / (10 min/block) / (270 byte/tx) = 1481 tx/min
It assumes 100% segwit adoption, native addresses, 4*4 MB blockweight (maximum block size of 16 MB, but actual blocksize around 7 MB).  That is, 4  times what the segwit soft fork would allow.
If you ask for the true maximum, a transaction can probably as short as 50 bytes (one input, one output, anyone can spend, no signature, no script).   The  SegWit discount doesn't matter since there is no signature.  This would give you 8000 tx/min with 4 MB  blocks.  But it is not very useful.

"miners" is correct.  All nodes validate, but miners can extend the invalid chain and make it longer than the segwit chain.
If the majority of miners do not validate the new segwit rules anymore after it has been activated, a fork can occur.   Those that upgraded only see the chain that follows the segwit rules.  Those that didn't upgrade follow the longest chain, even if it is the one where a malicious miner stole all segwit funds.  In that case we have two bitcoins, one longer chain where a hacker has all the money that was put into segwit, and one shorter chain where everything was transacted normal.  It is then up to the bitcoin users to decide which bitcoin they think is the right one.
The same happens for multisig addresses if for some reason the majority of miners decide to no longer validate p2sh scripts.

This transaction depends on a large unconfirmed transaction (6683 bytes at 42 sat/byte level).  You have three options:
1. use the viabtc accelerator 
2. pay additional fee by sending your unconfirmed output to yourself with a large fee (but you need to pay at least 0.002 btc because you pay for the large unconfirmed transaction)
3. wait. These congestions are still temporary and I guess it will dissolve in 5-36 hours.

I can try compute the average total but I'm not sure how it helps.  Should this include transactions paying no fee or paying only 1 satoshi per byte? Also it is the nature of the backlog to have a very rugged shape with sharp peaks often quickly going back to zero afterwards.
Lets look only at transactions with 5 satoshi/byte (the minimum relay fee). During the last month the unconfirmed transactions peaked between 2000 and 10000 during quiet phases (phases with increased mining power) and between 20000 and 70000 during more busy phases.  See my graphs at 
A few hours ago we had 23.9 BTC fees in unconfirmed transactions.
Paying more fee really helps.  Miners start with the transactions that pay the most per byte.  Currently a sweet spot seems to be 70 satoshi/byte as a lot of transactions pay less.  This doesn't guarantee you quick confirmation, but even during the busiest times you wouldn't have waited more than 15 hours.
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:47:30
It looks like the peak for today is reached and it may be confirmed in a few hours.  It is hard to exactly say when.  It also depends on whether the miners are lucky and find a lot of blocks or not.  But usually at this time of day the backlog is shrinking again.
Of course, it also depends on the exact fee.  Divide the fee of your transaction by size in bytes to get the fee level.  Then you know in which colored stripe your transaction is and can estimate yourself how fast it will confirm.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:22:10
It depends on how well RBF transactions (your double spend) spread.  Some miners don't accept them and a lot of nodes don't propagate them.
Also the miners are currently mining the 65 sat/byte transactions (there are a lot with exactly this fee).  Once they are done, your old 64.935 sat/byte transactions should be next, so even if the double-spend transaction doesn't propagate, there is a good chance that the other transaction confirms soon.
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:28:18
Accumulating 0.0001 BTC inputs should still work.  At 5-10 satoshi/byte you pay about 8-15 % fee and on most weekends such a transaction succeeds.  Make sure that there is no dust change output (fee + amount should exactly equal the balance).  Also include all dust you have up to 100-500 inputs (not more, otherwise the transaction gets too large to be accepted).
I like the electrum "send from" feature where I can choose exactly which inputs I want to spend and where I can use the "Max" button to compute the amount automatically.
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:49:28
There are more than 20000 transaction in the queue before you and another 18000 transaction paying *exactly* the same fee.

I think block hashes are not allowed to repeat, so there is no way to create a legal block.

When segwit activates, 95 % of the miners signalled that they will follow SW rules, so there will be at most 5 % non-SW miners.


For non-SW miners and nodes such a transaction is non-standard.  They won't relay or mine such transactions.  You can actually try it by spending the bitcoins sent to ViaBTC's segwit address 3EhZGZhjStjfxeM6WfPxzKpWMBLpqmAKtd
Even if a misguided miner would mine such a transaction after segwit activates, his block will be ignored by the SW miners which are the majority and after a short time the block is orphaned, as if it never happened.

Let's quote [bitcoincore.org](


My guess is that the number 2.1 from the [SegWit Misinformation FAQ]( stems from a quotation error. They never explained how they got the number, though.   I guess the source said something that the factor 1.6 is outdated and with p2sh multisig addresses the factor is up to 2.1 and the number of p2sh multisigs increased recently (to 28 % as the graphic shows and then back to 20%).    But, of course, the multisig fraction never reached 100%, which would be required to get 2.1.
As long as nobody finds a flaw in my [spreadsheet]( I conclude that the current factor is around 1.85 (+/- 0.05), provided everyone updates to BIP-142 addresses or whatever standard will be accepted for segwit addresses.

If Schnorr is implemented as a soft-fork (I think this is the current plan), it wouldn't help for dust that you already accumulated.  Like with segwit, you have to opt-in to Schnorr signatures by creating a new Schnorr address and move the money over to use the new feature.

It's a standard 65 sat/byte transaction.  I have the feeling that a third of all transactions are between 65 and 66 sat/byte, so you are right at the end of the crowd.  Next time, pay 300 satoshi more.  In this case it would have confirmed more than 13 hours ago.
Of course, if I tell too many people this neat trick, it doesn't work anymore.

ELI5 is difficult :)
First I have a program that reads the blockchain and writes down for each block the following information: 
1. the number of transactions
2. the size (total size of all transactions)
3. the size of the signatures (everything that gets discounted by segwit)
4. the number of transaction inputs
5. the number of P2SH transaction output
Then a small script sums this information up for 1000 blocks and writes it to the spreadsheet.
Now the calculations:
1. segwit size: the signatures get 75% discount, but p2sh outputs are roughly 11 bytes bigger (since they use 256-bit hashes instead of 160-bit). So segwit size = transaction size - .75 * signature size + 11 * number of p2sh outputs.
2. p2sh size:  p2sh needs additional 23 byte for every input spent.  A p2sh script is 23 bytes and when spending it, the corresponding input script contains the segwit script.
This calculation is not byte-precise.  Segwit transactions save one or two bytes in the size of the output script and need a few extra bytes for witness encodings.  But the error should be within 1 %.

The signature algorithm is not ECDH but ECDSA.  The signature is computed as follows:
Let q be the order of the elliptic curve, G the generator.
Take private key d, public key is Q=dG.
Take a random nonce k, compute R=kG.
Let z be the hash of the message to sign.
Signature is r=(R.x mod q) and s = (z + rd)/k mod q.
It is easy to see that
    sR = zG + rQ 
because sR = (z+rd)/k * kG = zG + rdG = zG + rQ
Now to compute Q, you can first recover R from r (there are usually two possibilities, four possibilities at most). Then, Q = s/r * R - z/r * G.
(s/r and z/r are computed modulo q, the order of the elliptic curve)
The signature stores two additional bits to remember which of the four possible R is the correct one.

The BIP declares blocks that don't signal Segwit readiness as illegal.  It is not a block that steals Segwit utxos that will fork the chain, but on October 1st some miners will simply start to mine a minority chain where they ignore any block that doesn't signal Segwit readiness.  And some users will only accept this minority chain. 
Users that don't upgrade to UASF in time will just ignore this and will follow non-UASF chain with more proof of work.  So a hard fork that activates in less than a year  is unacceptable because we can't get everyone to upgrade in time, but with UASF everyone is certain that the economic majority will upgrade in six months?

They also produced a 270 kB Block, when there were about 18 BTC fee waiting in unconfirmed transactions to be mined (and at &gt;100 sat/byte fee level):
Maybe they just had to restart their node which cleared their mempool?  Anyway, it is their problem (missing out on fee) and the additional 0.8 MB backlog isn't even noticeable.
EDIT: both blocks are almost 270 kB.  Probably not a coincidence, but a soft limit they set on the blocks under certain conditions.

It should go through eventually, but since the last two weeks &gt; 11 hours is normal for transactions with 50 sat/B.  So far, the longest wait time for this fee was two days and it looks like this backlog may be even worse than the previous ones.

Two weeks ago a 40 sat/byte transaction would have taken 10 days to confirm.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:27:37
You lost nothing yet.  Of the two transaction only one can confirm and if it does you still have the 50 $ change.
Both transactions are unlikely to confirm soon (if ever) at the current fee pressure.   They pay 38.9 satoshi per byte and if you want to confirm it anytime soon you should pay at least to 125 satoshi per byte - 0.32 mBTC - (bitcoinfees.21.co suggest 240 for fastest, or 200 for a 90 % chance of a confirmation in an hour).
Your options are: 
1. You can try to double-spend again, this time with a higher fee.  The problem may be, that the double-spend doesn't propagate well and the few miners that accept double-spends are not receiving your transaction.
2. You can try to send the unconfirmed change output to yourself with a very high fee (at least 0.5 mBTC) to pay for the old and the new transaction.  This is much better supported by miners, but I'm not sure if blockchain.info allows you to do that.  To keep the transaction small make sure you send exactly the right amount (after subtracting the fee) so that there is no change output.
3. Try the viabtc accelerator (it usually reached its limit, but maybe you are lucky).
Double the fee for immediate confirmation.  125 sat/byte is the "it will probably confirm within a few hours" fee.
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:05:10
This is one of the transactions
This consolidates a lot of dust inputs as you suspected.  They may actually confirm these weekend, but it is not certain.  Depends on how many blocks are found and whether someone else pushes a few megabytes of transactions.  Since most inputs are small it doesn't make sense to pay much more fee.
There are currently 14 MB between 11-20 sat/byte (above them), these transactions take about 16 MB and then there are another 8 MB between 10 and 10.98 sat/byte.

Segwit with 95 % activation threshold is pretty safe due to being a soft fork.  There is no danger of a split and if someone mines a block that violates SegWit rules, it will quickly be orphaned by 95 % mining power. 
But for UASF, it depends on the particular UASF proposal.
1. Signaling for SegWit is mandatory:  Upgraded miners will try to orphan non upgraded miners that don't signal for SegWit.  If they are in the minority this would produce two chains.  It also risks that the miners are just faking the signal to avoid getting orphaned and then we have case 2.
2. Segwit activates without miners supporting it:  This is a ticking time bomb.  If at any time in the future someone mines a block invalid under SegWit rules (e.g. just the wrong hash in the coinbase), the non-upgraded miners will happily build on it, and if they are the majority we get a split.  There are also problems that blocks from non-upgraded miners will propagate slower to segwit miners and may lead to more orphaned blocks and unexpected larger reorgs.
For case 2, someone can even run a withholding attack where he mines a valid segwit block, but keeps one of the segwit signatures secret.  Non upgraded nodes will build on the block and extend the chain, segwit nodes will not be able to receive it without the missing signature and work on their own minority chain.  100 blocks later the malicious miner reveals the missing segwit signature and the block is finally accepted by Segwit miners.  They will now have to reorg to the longer chain, since both chains are valid.

So you did an experiment on a Sunday evening when the previous week there were several posting that the mempool is empty and that 2 sat/B transactions confirmed? I also got a transaction with 2 cent fees confirmed in 3 minutes (on Saturday a week ago).
Please try it again on Thursday after the next difficulty update or when the price jumps beyond 1200 $ again.
I never had problems to get my transactions confirmed, but I know the fee I have to use, what confirmation time to expect, and I know how to RBF or CPFP or use TX accelerators.  A user who just opens his old bitcoin wallet once in a while can easily run into the fee trap if he isn't following Bitcoin news.

It is correct in the article and in the headline.  I had a 2.16 satoshi/byte transaction that confirmed in 3 minutes.  The mempool was empty from 05:00-07:00, from 09:00-10:15 and from 13:00 - 14:00 UTC.
If you placed your 2 sat/byte transaction before 14:00 UTC it should be confirmed now.   If not, good luck tomorrow, or you may have to wait a few weeks for another chance.  In the last few hours, transactions with 120 sat/B or less were not confirmed.

10 satoshi/byte was always cheap and could take hours to confirm since about half a year.  But the last two weeks we had much larger backlogs at higher fees.  You are unfortunate that you missed the weekend's low fees.  Now it can take anything from a few hours to a week to confirm.  Probably several days.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:44:42
It's confirmed now - I'm not exactly sure why AntPool prioritised it.
The fee per byte is low, because the transaction is large.  One reason is that you are still using an old uncompressed key.  You may want to create a new address (and don't forget the backup).  This would save you about 16 % in the future.
But also the fees have risen, especially in the last two months. Today 31000 satoshi is barely enough for a transaction of minimal size.  Your transaction combined four inputs and requires at least a three times higher fee.  And a high priority fee for your transaction that would confirm in less than an hour is more than 5 times what you paid.

The agreement says 


So it was known at that time and they explicitly wanted a blocksize increase even for non-segwit transaction.


Good question.  When the whole discussion started the fees were negligible.  A year ago they were less than 2 % of the block reward. So at that time I think it didn't occur to the miners how lucrative the fee market could get for them.  
However they have a lot of investments in hardware, so they also have to be careful to not drive too many users away from bitcoin, because the fees get ridiculous.  Also the price of bitcoin is more important than the amount of fees.  Although the last months seemed to indicate that the higher the backlog the higher the price (or is it just vice versa?).

If the firmware isn't signed by Satoshilabs, the Trezor is wiped on update and the bootloader displays a warning that you have to confirm on every startup.  Only if you now ignore the warning and recover your seed, then a malicious firmware may leak the seed.
So if you don't ignore the warning, an unsigned firmware has no way to access the seed, as it is already removed when the firmware is installed.

There are too many transactions in the queue that pay a higher fee than your transactions.  Although, at the moment the blocks are coming fast and there were a few transactions with less than 60 sat/B confirmed, I wouldn't recommend to go lower with the fee than 100 sat/B. Even last Sunday the transaction backlog was only cleared to about 48 sat/B level.
Multibit seems to have the fee levels of several months ago hardcoded in.  In December or beginning of January that may have worked, but the fees are rising fast now and every wallet should implement dynamic fees.  For fast confirmation &gt; 200 sat/B should be used now.
Maybe next Sunday will be better.  This Sunday the blocks were slow and the recent difficulty increase was not helping to clear the backlog.

So he has 750 BTC in an address.  Then he sends 0.25 BTC out (is a 270 $ transaction considered a microtransaction today?) and gets 749.749 BTC change back.  Then repeat since the next customer wants to have his payout. True, he could save a lot of fees by sending all his transactions in a single transaction instead of chaining them, but that takes some coding to get right (he seems to use the basic blockchain.info API). Given the amount transferred, he is probably fine with paying 0.1-1 % fees.
His 18000 transaction since December used 4 MB of 12 GB blockchain.  You can't even see the effect on the unconfirmed transaction count. And if he wouldn't reuse his address, nobody wouldn't even have noticed.

The BU plan is to wait until they get 75 % before doing anything.  In principle they can try to fork earlier, but if they only have, say, 60 % it has a high chance to fail with a big reorg to the core chain.  This would be the worst-case result from the BU perspective. 
There is a big difference between 30 % and 75 %, so a hard fork is not very likely to happen soon.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:15:13
And just 15 minutes after your post, the next backlog started and during the last two hours almost no transaction below 120 sat/B was mined. If you want one hour confirmation you have to go in the 200 sat/B region. If you don't care about speed, you can at the moment go to 10 sat/B.
The point is, it is not easy to predict how much fees you need to pay for quick confirmation.  It's like predicting whether the bitcoin price goes up or down.

Sorry, but enough hash rate loss can severely damage bitcoin.  If 75% hash rate leave the current consensus, there will be a congestion like we never have experienced before.  For eight weeks only two weeks worth of transactions are confirmed, while six weeks of transactions (6000 MB or about 12 million transactions) will backlog (assuming the economic majority stays on the chain).  Maybe that much backlog will never happen, as the people will stop sending transactions when the fees go beyond 0.01 bitcoin.  But fees will escalate (I think in the order of 0.1 bitcoin for small transactions).  In the most optimistic scenario, after eight weeks, difficulty is reduced and things are slowly going back to normal while the Gigabytes of backlog are slowly confirming.

Only that the fees haven't changed since March 10, even though the address you cited was hit by malleability and hasn't done any transactions since then (they still have 2 million $ in the address and didn't move it).
The increase of bc.i's default fee from 65 to 120 on Feb 22 had much more impact on the fees, which increased from 150 to over 200.  Now 120 is the new low limit for fees that will make the difference between a few hours and possibly more than a day.  
Estimating the fees is difficult due to variance.  If a block takes one hour, it will likely not confirm any transaction below 240 sat/byte.  With normal blocks delays you are fine if you stay above 121 (at least outside the busiest times of the day).

It's 3 % of the votes, not 3% of the people that voted.
And while you mention distorting facts. There is no way to distribute the votes such that your headline would be  correct.  90 % segwit would require that at most 425 people voted (since there were only 383 votes for segwit in total) and in that case BU without Segwit would have at least 4 % and you are counting the 11 % that only want Segwit with BU as Segwit and not as BU.

To answer the question what to do now.
1.  You can try to double-spend, but that is not really working well. 
2. If you received some change from your transaction it works better to send this change output to yourself with a very high fee.  The fee must be high enough to pay for the previous and the new transaction.    
3. Or you can try the viabtc accelerator.  But I think it only works for &gt; 10 sat/B transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:09:06
I think the idea is to send both, sell one and withdraw the other (and then notice that all your funds are frozen until you fill out all the AML/KYC questionnaires).
You can probably easily split your coins using opt-in RBF, by first sending them with a smaller fee to yourself, wait until it gets confirmed on one chain and then bumping the fee (and optionally changing the destination address) to get a different transaction confirmed on the other chain.  This shouldn't be too difficult as the fee levels are probably much different between the chains.  But then you need to install a BU client to send BTU to the exchange.

\&gt; You can see in the graphs that there are several different slopes there too, which makes it seem pretty clearly like different parties.
You know that the x-axis is block number not time?  The slopes are different if you plot against time.  Also the early clients increased the nonce every time a transaction is sent (but only once a minute) or a new block is received, so the slope also depends on the traffic of the network and this changed over the first year.
Of course, you can argue that there could have been multiple persons who independently ran bitcoin miners in 2009 with some non-public code that somehow synchronised the extra nonce over the internet and these persons all independently decided to never spend their coins.  The chance that this pattern was caused by a single person that ran a bitcoin miner in the default settings on a single machine running at roughly 4-5 MHash/s is much higher and it is not that far fetched to assume that it was Satoshi.  
And just because someone claims he has bitcoins and therefore must be Satoshi is not really a good reason to discard the extra nonce analysis as bogus.
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:42:10
The diagram is there at the bottom of the blog: 
The slopes are not completely parallel, but that can also be explained by other effects that change the extra nonce.


It's hard to say for sure which blocks are part of the slope and which are just accidentally in between, especially when the numbers are small, but the extra-nonce pattern suggests that all the first 150 blocks except for blocks 12, 27, 64, 131 were mined by the same machine. However, you probably can't trust extra nonce values below 100, because the value could just accidentally fit into the pattern. For example, we know from a screen shot that Hal mined block 78 with extra nonce 15, but the extra nonce pattern would fit perfectly with block 73-77 with extra nonces 1-14 which were not mined by the same client (assuming Hal didn't fake the screen shot).

He doesn't clog up the mempool.  Only 5 kb are added to the mempool every 10 minutes, due to chained transactions.  He just pays the miners 0.1 BTC for having 0.5 % of their blockspace, which is quite lucrative for the miners.
It's basically free money for the miners, without any adverse effects on the blockchain.  And if bitcoin cannot handle having every 1000 $ payment on chain, then IMHO it has a serious problem.

Yes, that is theoretically possible, either with malicious intent or accidentally.
This is why they publish the source code of the firmware on github, so that everyone can check the code for bugs or backdoors.  You can download the source and compile it and check that it produces exactly the same binary firmware.
In the end you always have to trust your wallet or review the source code yourself, whether it is a software wallet, a hardware wallet, or a paper wallet generator.  With Trezor you only have to trust or review the firmware, while with a software wallet you have to trust the wallet software, the operating system, and the other software you installed on the system.

Is it known whether the author of this text is a miner? I find the argument that miners want to maximise only the fees strange for the following reasons
1. Fees have only recently become a noticeable part of the earnings. Still it is less than 20% and the btc price should be much more important than the fee for the miners (short and long term)
2. Miners are voting for larger blocks. If activated, this would instantly lead to 4-10x less fee because there is no fee pressure anymore. This will not be offset by 4x more transactions in the near future.
3. If miners want to block 2nd level transactions, they can just block transactions that open payment channels. They can unilaterally agree on a soft fork to do this. Or they can require that those transactions pay 10x the usual fee and get their share, which is probably even more profitable.
Blocking a bug fix because it makes it harder to implement a new technology that would improve bitcoin and enable new use cases just make no sense

The same attack is possible after SegWit activates.  If you switch to SegWit you are not affected unless you receive money from someone who is not using SegWit.
BIP-62 or BIP-146 would have prevented this attack but the soft-forks are not finalized.  There are also some relay rules active for some time to prevent that [anyone can malleate]( to high-S signatures just for fun.  Only miners can run this attack.

Most of these transaction confirmed today (3.5 MB left), so it was smart to consolidate the small inputs with low fee.  Someone (maybe the same one) put another 10 MB at 59.9 sat/byte level now.
Similar things happen every weekend.  Services are using periods of low fees to consolidate their dust inputs.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:49:39
Note that  is a paid service. At more than 7$ per kb their fee is not very competitive and if it gets too popular they can further increase the fee.  In fact CPFP is much cheaper to use.  However it is easier to just enter the txid and your credit card number instead of importing your private key into electrum and figuring out how to send a CPFP transaction with the right fee.   This service may be worth the 7 $ for some people.

It doesn't matter that much, if the blocks are 1.5 MB due to SegWit or due to a hard fork. In both cases they will take 1.5 MB in the blk*.dat files. Unless you run a pruning node, but then the block chain is only a few GB in size.

LND uses bitcoind only to access the blockchain, but it doesn't store anything in bitcoind.  As long as your LND databases are not corrupted, you should still be able to access your channel balance.  You should start by making a backup of your `.lnd` directory (but stop lnd first).

1. you can scan the blockchain to see if the private/public key was ever used in a multisig.  However, if it is p2sh multisig  (a multisig with a 3.. address) then you only see the public key if the address has an outgoing payment.  If you don't know all other signers of the multisig it is impossible to check if an unspent p2sh address is a multisig with your key or something else.
2. yes, although it is not good practise to use a key for more than one purpose.  So you shouldn't use the same private key for multisig and for a normal wallet.

The problem is accountability.  Everyone can check how many BTC are locked in the Liquid multisig address and how many L-BTC are issued.  If these numbers do not match, this is a red flag indicating that there is some serious problem with L-BTC.
With Lightning, there is, by design, no way to find out for some external party what the two individual balances are.  Only the total balance is visible.  So if blockstream/the liquid federation would offer paying via a lightning channel and issuing L-BTC even for BTC locked on a lightning channel, external observers would no longer be able to audit the issuing process.

12 word seed is secure enough, but if you recover you have to enter the words in a random order.  There are not enough ways to order 12 words to be secure.  The additional words that Trezor asks you to enter in between help a bit, but only if you don't recover a second time.
Of course, this assumes the worst case that your computer is already infected with a key logger.

The idea is to get &gt; 75 % miner support and a large number of "economically relevant" full nodes and only then hard fork.  This is why miners should set EB1 at the moment, so that they don't start mining on the losing chain.
If BU would fork at 50 % and then core catches up with a 100 block reorg on the BU chain, that would probably be the death of BU.
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:58:56
Since they have ~15 % hashrate, it would increase the average time until the first block with segwit transaction is mined by 1/.85 or 17 %, i.e., 11 minutes and 45 seconds.  This is the average confirmation time for high-fee transactions.
For very low-fee transactions nothing changes at all, unless the size of segwit transaction exceeds 85 %.

Sometimes if you have small inputs it would cost more in transaction fees to spend it than it is worth. If you don't care about the money, you can also donate it to a miner: Put "OP_RETURN" into the "Pay to" field, make **amount 0** and put your exact balance in the fee field. (Pro Tip: first write 0 in fee, then press ! in amount and then use copy &amp; paste to swap the fields).  You can preview the transaction and check that it has only one output.
This removes your coins from the blockchain cleaning up the UTXO set, which is a good thing.
Note: everything you send to OP_RETURN is not given to the miner but instead forever destroyed.  So put 0 in amount, unless you really want to burn the coins.

It all depends how paranoid you are.  Usually it is okay to connect a hardware wallet to an always online desktop.  For your super-secure cold storage that you created on an offline pc, you may not want to do this.  But normally, connecting a hardware wallet to an online pc is not dangerous.

When you setup your hardware wallet online, it is technically indirectly connected to your internet, but an attacker would first compromise your PC and second compromise the hardware wallet via the proprietary USB protocol.  The USB protocol is very simple (no routing, only few messages supported) so it should be easier to get it bug-free than a full general-purpose networking interface.
The hardware wallet is a little computer of its own that stores your private key.  The main purpose is to keep the private keys protected by never sending them out.  The only time it leaks its secret is when it tells you the words of the recovery seed.  This is only done via the display; the words are not sent to the PC or the internet.
You sometimes have to download firmware updates from the internet and install them on your hardware wallet.  However, these firmware updates are signed by the vendor, and the device will always check the signature and warn you, if you have installed unofficial firmware.
BTW, you can setup most hardware wallets on an offline computer using some command line tools or electrum.  Only for firmware updates you need to be online.
If you want a really cold wallet, setup your hardware wallet offline, copy the xpub or a bunch of addresses, check that your recovery words are correct, wipe the hardware wallet to factory settings, and keep the recovery words in a secure place.  Fund the public keys that you copied earlier, or import the xpub in a watch-only wallet and put your savings there.  The secret key is only on the piece of paper with the recovery words.  You can use the hardware wallet for your semi-cold wallet.  If you need to spend the savings, you can recover your funds with the words on any hardware wallet.  This is even more secure than a paper wallet; for a paper wallet, you need to compute the public key from the private key on some general purpose computer, which may be compromised.

The good news is that you are probably not alone with that particular problem.  The address you linked to has a lot of unconfirmed transactions all from today and you are on a long chain of unconfirmed transactions.
It doesn't look like a scam, just that someone has programmed too low fees into their algorithm.  Since about 12 hours there have been a backlog of transactions.  You may try to use the viabtc accelerator  - but I'm not sure if it can handle long chains of unconfirmed transactions.
It's the backlog of the bitcoin network - not CoinBase's fault at all (unless they chose the fee).  The bitcoin network is limited to 3-4 tx/sec and today it is quite busy.  Just be patient, it may resolve itself.  But don't send out goods or mark a trade as completed before you get the confirmation.
That your address has changed is normal.  Most wallets change the Bitcoin addresses after each use to make it harder for others to know how much bitcoins you have.

The incoming tx count hasn't increased, but the confirmed tx count has gone down very fast, especially on Monday, due to difficulty increase combined with bad luck of the miners.  Now the bad luck streak of the miners seems to be over and the mempool has stabilized.  It is even going slowly down.

Even 50 satoshi per byte is too low at the moment.  There was almost no transaction confirmed today with 60 satoshi per byte or less.  There is currently a huge backlog of transaction with 60-70 satoshi per byte. See
So you should pay more than 70 satoshi per byte or be prepared to wait for a while.

I think it is just their prediction algorithm to initially assume that the next difficulty update will be as huge as the last one.  But if the miners are still adding more hash power, then the backlog will only be short-lived until it reappears in two weeks.

Many wallets will probably crash when parse256(IL) &gt;= n or do something strange, as this is most likely completely untested.   Especially when this happens in an earlier step of the BIP-44 path, e.g. if the derivation for 44' is not defined, it is unlikely that the wallet will use the path 45' (and if it does, it is incompatible with most other wallets).
The chance that this happens is very slim.  Even if a trillion people each generate a billion wallets with a billion addresses in each wallet, the global chance that one of them runs into this problem is less than one in a million.

The only link he gives out for free is to a special unsigned binary firmware.  I haven't analysed this yet.  It could be one part necessary to do the attack, but without documentation it is nearly useless.  You'd need to disassemble the binary and it is probably easier to write something like it from scratch.

Not many.  But some people use cloud mining services with daily payout.  Then after two years, they have 600 inputs, try to spend their earnings, and complain that Trezor isn't working since the progress bar isn't moving (it is moving, but only a pixel every few minutes). Of course, at that time, they may also notice that for every received transaction they have to pay 10 cent transaction fee to spend it and complain about the 60 $ transaction fee.
You can work around this by aggregating your inputs using multiple transactions with 50-100 inputs and 1 output.  You don't save much transaction fees by using one big transaction.

Greg Maxwell suggested to have a third measurement, by fee.  I have it running here (see the bottom most chart): 
(data goes back only 3.5 days).
This gives a better perspective of what we are talking about.  These are low fee transactions (probably aggregating customer funds).  They are at 1 sat/byte paying  less than half a bitcoin fee in total.  During May, the backlog was at 120 sat/byte and beyond and the backlogged fee went over 150 btc.  If you pay a cent fee for your 250 byte transaction, you won't notice this backlog at all.

If you look at my [mempool statistics]( at Oct 27, around 15:00 UTC, this behaviour is obvious.  Antpool found four consecutive blocks, so there were a lot of segwit transactions accumulating in the mempool that they didn't take.  Their block 547,566 with 0.04 BTC fee, accepted mostly low fee transaction.  The next block by btc.com had 0.24 BTC fee.
See it positively.  It shows that bitcoin cannot be censored.  The miners that take the transactions make more profit than miners that ignore them for ideological reasons.

In principle everything can be undone, but if for example a transaction  has enough confirmation, then nobody is rewriting the blockchain to erase it, even if it stole millions of bitcoins.

A fast increase is something that happens in a day or less. E.g. in July 2015 the transaction rate increased from 2 to 3 tx/sec exactly when the backlog started and went then back to 2 after a few days. Another indicator was that it broke the day/night cycle.  I haven't seen anything similar in the backlogs in November or now.

P2WPKH (and P2WSH for multisig) is what I called native segwit addresses.  So these give you 86 % more capacity and roughly the same bandwidth per transactions.  Only problem is that nobody implemented these yet since there is no standard format.  But, yes, it doesn't require another soft-fork and it can be quickly rolled out later.
The difference of 22 vs 25 bytes public key scripts is probably negligible.  If you get that picky you should also mention the 2 byte overhead per transaction and 1 byte per input for the witnesses and the 11 byte overhead for the extra security of p2wsh addresses.  (This is out of my head; I may have missed another byte or two in one or the other direction).  I also didn't take into account the 32 bytes segwit saves for people still using uncompressed keys -- but they can also save these without segwit.

How am I attacking segwit?  I just computed the capacity increase for the current usage pattern.  If you think the numbers are wrong, explain it.  If you want my opinion: I'm all for segwit. Even 50 % would help a lot at the moment, but we need another capacity increase soon. Remember that it took almost three years from the first serious capacity discussions until the release of segwit.  And even in the most optimistic scenario it will take another month until segwit gets activated.
I think the 2.1x number you sometimes hear is for 100 % multisig address usage.  It looks like it got quoted out of context and many people think that is the correct number for current usage.  But the current capacity doesn't even suffice to let everyone switch to multisig before segwit is activated.
Also everyone is quoting the numbers for native p2wpkh segwit addresses, even though no effort was done in the last six months to standardize an address format; a prerequisite for wallets to support these addresses.

The main reason that worked, is that there was little traffic (the coins never even moved) and no exchanges.
If something like this would happen today and the attacker sells 100,000 bitcoins of the 184 billion bitcoins he created within a few minutes on several exchanges, the price would crash and it would be very hard to contain the damage.  If the reaction comes fast enough, the exchanges may freeze all funds immediately and then revert the money printing transaction and all coins originating from it and all trades involving these coins, but it would still cause a lot of confusion and uproar.

You can't buy hash power that doesn't exists.  I think most existing hash power is already mining bitcoins.  And if you buy existing hash power that is already mining SegWit you don't gain anything.
There are other ways, e.g. 51 % attack, but that would shine a bad light on SegWit.  You don't want to cheat with the activation threshold because it would make the soft fork unsafe.

Some services (exchanges, bitcoin casinos, etc) get a lot of transactions from their customers and if they are smart they aggregate them at low fees.
Have you looked at the transactions?  Just take look for a block that confirmed some of them; they are usually at the end of the block.  They are aggregating lots of inputs from multisig addresses.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:34:29
I wonder why so many people think that is a spam attack.  The mathematics for queue size says that the average number of waiting transactions is proportional to rho/(1-rho), where rho is the utilisation factor.  So at 80 % utilisation you get a queue length of 4 (blocks), at 90% of 9 (blocks) and at 95 % utilisation of 19 blocks.  At 99% utilisation the *average* backlog is 100 blocks worth of transactions and would take over two months to clear on average.  So a minimal growth (or the 10 % block time increase due to the difficulty increase two days ago) has big effects at this utilisation.  Also there is a lot of variance (proportional to 1/(1-rho)^2).  Wondering about the "sudden" growth in queued transactions is like wondering about an hour without any new block.
The fact that people jump the queue by paying higher fees or even use cpfp (more transactions to clean up previous transactions) makes it even worse for the average person who doesn't jump the queue.
Look at the statistics; the number of transactions didn't grow from last week.
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:33:58
See for example the [risks due to larger blocks section of the segwit costs and risks page](  Segwit transactions have roughly the same size (let's ignore p2sh/p2wpkh transactions).  But the "witness discount" allows more transactions per block.  A witness byte counts only as a quarter byte for the 1 MB limit but it takes a full byte of disk space. So a block can use at most 4 MB when witnesses are heavily used (1.8 MB is more realistic for 100 % adoption with current multisig mix).
Of course, this increase is only there, if more transactions (or larger transactions) are sent.

SegWit needs a firmware update, but that is also sufficient.  In fact, due to some improvements in SegWit (input amount is signed, linear hashing) it will even be faster to sign large transactions with the same hardware.
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:28:44




What is really ironic is that I never found an explanation for the 2.1 MB figure.
[This medium post]( mentions it without explanation.  [My own computation]( show a bit more than 1.8 MB, definitely less than 1.9 MB.  And more like 1.5 MB when we still use p2sh segwit addresses.  So 1.7 MB is closer to the truth than 2.1 MB.
Admittedly, even with p2sh segwit addresses, the blocks can be 1.8MB with the current mix.  It still only gives 50 % more transactions, though, because the transactions are a bit bigger.
If we had p2sh segwit today with 100 % adoption the blocks would be as empty as they were 14 months ago.

Yes, there's even a mathematical theory behind this.  It is called queue theory.
Do you think the fact that today it takes 8 % longer on average to remove 1 MB transactions from the queue than yesterday has nothing to do with the queue getting longer during busy hours?  The difference is more than 11 MB a day.  This is about the amount of transactions with more than 10 sat/byte fee that are currently in the queue.  In other words, without the difficulty increase we wouldn't have a backlog.
@_date: 2016-11-28 11:48:35


I think this is another example of bike-shedding.  Peter Wuille and the other collaborators did an excellent job designing and implementing segwit and then someone said that he didn't like ~~the color of the bike shed~~ using base58 addresses.  Someone else suggested base32 addresses with a different checksum, another one wanted stealth addresses, and in the end the agreement was to just ignore native segwit addresses and defer the discussion until segwit is activated.  After all employees can use the existing bike shed (p2sh) and take the shuttle bus from there.

Which spam attack?  Fees rise when we have a period with slow blocks and then fall again when the miners get more lucky.  And of cause they fall over night and on the week-end when the number of new transactions goes back and the low-fee backlog is cleared.
We are at about 85-90 % usage. So the backlog from busy periods or periods with long block delays will still clear in the long run.
PS: fees now at 14 cents; we only had 4 blocks in the last hour.

Every signature is build with a random value k. If this value is not random the signature can be used to recover the private key.  Moreover, if the same seemingly random value is used twice with the same public key, the random value and the private key can be recovered. Now, this is even true if the same random value is used twice with two different keys that belong to the same master public key (but only if the master public key is also known).
If a random value is used twice one can easily see this in the signature.  So far there were over 4000 random values (in several hundred million signatures) that were used at least twice, and often with the same key.  Most wallets generate this random value deterministically (RFC-6979) so they avoid this problem completely, but there are still from time to time reused random values.
Also the master public key and a single child private key are enough to recover the master private key.

I'm not sure what the 17 output transactions are, but they only comprise an additional 0.1 tx/s at the peak.  Is this enough to spam the bitcoin network?
The increased number of UTXO can be explained by the fee pressure.  Since spending lots of inputs is quite expensive, more and more services clean up their UTXOs during low fee periods, only.
The article already gave a possible explanation for the higher transaction rejection rate.  It could also be caused by people trying to double-spend their transaction with a higher fee.

The blog post mentions network bandwidth and cpu power but I don't think the O( n^2 ) hashing problem was a known issue at that time.   Otherwise he would probably have reduced the maximum transaction size.  I am guessing here.
At that time the total block chain was 30 MB, so it was still easy to sync from fresh over a low bandwidth connection.

A noticable increase of incoming transactions?  E.g.

@_date: 2016-11-24 17:05:26
Statoshi.info can show the incoming transactions.  Compare this:
with the spam attack September/October 2015:
What we saw the last days is exactly what the theory would predict as the demand approaches the maximum capacity.  This is non-linear, a 5% increase of transactions at 90% capacity leads to a 100% increase of transaction backlog.  And it is also normal that the backlog sometimes spontaneously builds up to a few megabytes.
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:41:21
Of course, this assumes that you usually don't need change outputs because you always have an input with the exact amount you want to pay :).  With this assumption we can do 8.5 tx/s without segwit.  So segwit gives about 75 % more capacity.
For the current transaction mix the segwit increase is better due to more multisig transactions;  we go from 3.4 tx/s to 6.3 tx/s.

You have to wait until ViaBTC finds a block and then hope that not too many people are using the service.

With 50 sat/byte it is still a bit low.  Probably you sent it when the backlog started and the fees were not yet adapted.
It is probably still in the mempool of many miners, so don't assume that it is safe to blindly send the money again.  If you resend it, make sure you use the same inputs (electrum can send from specific addreesses if you mark them in the address tab and then right-click -&gt; Send From).  And avoid the 5 cent change output. Just add it to the fee; it is not economical to spend it anyway.

This doesn't make sense.  The number of transactions confirmed (under full load) is the same regardless how much fee is paid.  Indeed, the bad wallets helped to mitigate the problem for users of modern wallets.  They can easily jump the queue by paying a higher fee.
If it weren't for these old wallets and for the users who don't care how quickly their transactions confirmed, a higher fee would not help since everyone pays a higher fee.

EDIT: If you don't get the difficulty thing:  The miners adapt the difficulty every two weeks.  The 8 % increase means that there were about 8 % fewer blocks yesterday than the day before, i.e., about 11 MB.  There was no spam attack; it looks that Wednesday was busier than Thursday.

The fee is too low for its size.  It has 37 sat/byte; you should have paid about twice the amount for medium priority.  You can either wait until it confirms (depending on miner's luck, this can take days, though), use the ViaBTC accelerator (if you have done so, be patient, they haven't found a block yet), send the change to yourself with a higher fee (to pay for both the new transaction and the old one), or try to double-spend it with a higher fee (most miners reject double-spend, though).

My guess is the miner have been more lucky in finding blocks, or have added more hash power.  The last two days we had 159 blocks while on Nov. 22/23 (when the last big backlog was) we had 134/147 blocks.  There was a small backlog last Thursday after the difficulty update, but that was smaller than I suspected.
A five time increase in backlog makes not a lot of sense.  In some sense we had 200 mb backlog for quite a while, if you count zero satoshi transactions and it never went up to 1gb.  If you look only at &gt;10 sat/byte transactions, then we had 0 backlog 12 hours ago and 6 mb backlog 3 hours ago.  It is in the nature of the backlog to go wildly up and down.

I think UTXO commitments is very similar to what you're suggesting.  There is no balance in bitcoin but there are UTXOs, which are address-value-pairs of unspent coins.  So storing the state of the UTXOs corresponds to your idea.
Instead of splitting the ledger in 1000 blocks, using two levels as you suggested, you can split it over multiple levels to make the blocks smaller.  If you take this to the extreme, you get a Merkle-tree.  This was one idea to represent the UTXO set.
Adding an UTXO commitment would be a soft fork. Few months ago, there was some discussion on the bitcoin-dev list about a possible UTXO-commitments proposals.
Still a serious miner wants to store the whole utxo commitments locally, as even the disc seek time is currently a bottle-neck; you don't want to worsen it by reading it over the network.

With the transaction mix of recent 10000 blocks (blocks 430498-440497), it gives about 54 % more capacity for P2SH segwit.  With native segwit addresses (which would require a new address format) you get 86 % more capacity (assuming full adoption).
    txsize: 8233293375
    inputScriptSize: 5080570308
    inputCount: 39224287
    p2shSavings: txsize / (txsize - 3/4*inputScriptSize + 23 * inputCount)
    nativeSavings: txsize / (txsize - 3/4*inputScriptSize)
The maximum size is 4 MB but that would equate much fewer transactions (e.g. 15 of 15 multisigs with lots of inputs).  Realistically the capacity increase (with P2SH) is 54 % at a cost of  about 86 % larger blocks (this is the P2SH overhead that goes away with native segwit addresses).

If you have a single open channel, you can only send the coins via the other party of that channel.  If that other party cannot forward your coins (e.g. it is not connected to your the destination), the only way to send the locked coins to someone else is to close the channel.  If the other party is offline or uncooperative you need to close the channel using the pre\-signed time\-locked transactions and wait some time. And if the other party closes the channel, you get your money immediately back via an on\-chain transaction, but there is nothing you can do to keep the channel open.
LN is only fungible because you can close the channel in a case of dispute.  You can't immediately access the funds locked in a channel without the permission of the other party.

For those wondering, it does not look artificial.  Instead, it looks like one big actor accumulated a lot of 2-of-3 multisig UTXOs, e.g., an exchange or payment provider collecting its incoming payments.
It's almost the best case for segwit: transactions with lots of inputs, few output, 2-of-3 multisig.  It would have a slightly better ratio if it used bech32 instead of p2sh, though.
There are also a few big coinjoins using bech32, but they are single-sig and have lots of outputs, so they have a worse ratio and would only allow for 1.6 MB blocks.

I think, usually the extra data for segwit is not removed unless you run your node in pruning mode.  Currently the segwit data is just stored in the same files as all other data.
New nodes will handle the bigger blocks as the blocksize consensus rule changed; old nodes will not receive the witness data and store the transactions without it, so they will see blocks smaller than 1 MB.  This means that old nodes can't send new blocks to new nodes (they would be rejected as the witness is missing) and can't relay segwit transactions.

The block size can be even larger (segwit allows more transactions).  It is just the block size that old nodes see is smaller, since they receive the blocks without the witnesses part.  But for a new full node the blocks that are stored on disks are larger as the witness data is also stored on disk in the *same* files (this may be different for pruning nodes).
In the raw data the witnesses are stored as part of the transaction data, so there is no physical separation between witnesses and non-witness data.  Pruning nodes can remove witnesses more easily, since the transaction id only hashes the non-witness part.

Block 600,000 happened 2 weeks after the incident.  You can see on 1ml that the channels were closed on 2nd October.   So rusty definitely looked into the wrong blocks.
It may still turn out that most (maybe all) of the channels were force-closed by the other party when he started his node with an old state.  At least that happened with the channel to me and with two other random channels I checked.  In that case, everything should turn out fine.  He still needs his static channel backup and help from the other party (the other node needs to be online) to recover the funds, though.

There is some brute-force protection, but this is always a compromise between comfort and security.  TREZOR needs about a second to check the passphrase, but a desktop with a graphic card can check about hundred thousand passphrases per second.

I find it a big coincidence that the recent backlog spikes coincide with the times the  short term miners hash rate curve (512) goes below the difficulty line: 
The recent price spike can explain the increased traffic (people trying to monetize their old paper wallets, people arbitrating between exchanges). Also if there is a backlog people start using CFPF to change the priority of their transactions, which helps increasing the backlog.  And then there is a sharp increase of the backlog as the capacity is reached.  My simple simulation shows backlog peaks regularly at 60 MB if demand reaches 95 % of the capacity. (At &gt; 100 % the backlog grows without limits).
Despite what everyone is saying, we have never experimented with bitcoin running at capacity.  Until last month we were still at &lt; 85 %. But now we are almost there.

Lots of confusion here, but you pay more for more inputs.  
Bitcoin is based on utxo, not on balances.  That means if you send several payments to the same address, they aren't aggregated. Instead you need to sign each one of them separately when you spend.  It doesn't matter if it is the same address or different addresses.
Some cloud miners that tried to sell their mining profits (paid daily) in December 2017 can attest to this. 
There are balanced based altcoins (e.g. ethereum, stellar) that behave differently.

The spread-sheet includes both numbers.  For p2sh you get about 55 % more capacity for p2wpkh about 85 % more  capacity with the cost of 85 % larger blocks (in both cases).   This is a rough estimate; the p2wpkh transactions are around 1 % smaller if you do byte-precise computations (which I didn't).  On the other hand, multisig transactions are a few percent larger with segwit because security against hash collisions was improved.
Native non-p2sh segwit doesn't require another soft-fork; it just requires updates to the bitcoin clients to support a new address format.  However, there is no consensus on the new address format yet (BIP-142 is deferred).

It depends on the wallet.  For example, electrum will usually "forget" your transaction if you connect to a server that doesn't have the transaction.  You can sometimes manually delete a transaction.  This will only affect your wallet, but it usually allows you to create a new transaction that spend the funds again.
To ensure your old transaction isn't remembered by some miner and eventually mined, you need to then double-spend it by sending a new transaction spending the same inputs.  This works better if the previous transaction was low fee or very old, as this increases the chance that some or most miners don't have the original transaction and allow the double-spend.  If the previous transaction was RBF, you can double-spend it even if the miners knew of the previous transaction.

The main reason is that some batch non-urgent payments into large low fee transactions, while the high fee transactions are often small transactions. You can see in the bottom diagram that the blocks still remove the same 1 MB  (virtual size) from the mempool.
I think there is also one mining pool that doesn't mine any transaction below 10 sat/byte; at least I saw this behavior in the past. But most miners will mine still mine full blocks until the mempool is completely empty.

Your script that computes Z is wrong :)
They use SIGHASH_SINGLE and due to a bug in Satoshi's code, the reference implementation computes Z=1 for SIGHASH_SINGLE inputs if there is no corresponding output.   This bug is now part of the consensus and cannot be fixed without a soft fork.  Actually there was an early alternative implementation that did not have the bug, but it soft forked away from the longest chain when Peter Todd exploited this bug (basically the first failed  UASF of bitcoin).
Basically any address that signed Z=1 is now "anyone can spend" due to this bug.

No. If you do this (and I don't think that BIP 100 does suggest this), then 20 % of 60 % (E) would be 12 % for C, so A+C is 32 % 
But he never says that he takes the 20 % percentile after dropping off A and B, he says he takes the floor (which probably should mean the smallest value).  So he really just describes a strange algorithm to take the 20 % percentile.  I would be enough to drop A and take the minimum, no need to drop B.  I think at some time he suggested to take the average (not the median) value after dropping off A and B, but this was still seen as too dangerous and then he changed the BIP to its current form.
@_date: 2019-02-04 15:39:26
Yes, SIGHASH_SINGLE usually binds an input signature to the corresponding output address.  If there is no corresponding output, Satoshi's code returned an error value (1).  The bug is that the function that returned this error code should return the message hash.  So the error code is interpreted as hash and it accepts signatures that sign Z=1.
I'm not sure what the original intended use case for SIGHASH_SINGLE was.  Maybe something like CoinJoin, where you combine multiple transactions from multiple parties into one transaction, except that it doesn't hide which inputs and outputs belong together.

5460 satoshi was the dust limit when minimum transaction fee still was 10 sat/byte back in 2014 (now it is 546 satoshi).  The dust limit is the smallest amount of you are "allowed" to send to an address, if you send less, most nodes will reject your transaction and it will not even propagate to the miners.
The dust limit is computed as the amount that you can economically spend, i.e. if someone sends you less than the dust limit, the receiver would pay more than 30 % of the amount in fees to spend it, even if he spends it with the minimum transaction fee in the most efficient way.

I could put them with another party in a multisig and have a contract that states on which fork they should be paid out to which person, but then neither of us would have bitcoins while they are locked.
Once the fork has happened and both chains are not abandoned then it is okay to distinguish the coins that are valid on only one chain.  Which one of them is bitcoin and which the altcoin can then be decided by the economic majority.  *EDIT*: Just to clarify, the economic majority can also decide to call the coin it uses the altcoin if it thinks the other coin has the older claim to the name bitcoin.

Roger understands that but he is referring to the soft limit that every miner was enforcing when deciding how many transactions to include in a block.
Fun fact: at that time most full nodes would not have handled a 1 MB block full of small transactions.  Bitcoin hard forked in 2013 to increase the arbitrary limits put in by its database layer. You could also say it accidentally hard forked when he-who-must-not-be-named implemented a new database layer that didn't have these arbitrary limitations.  The limits were increased but not enough.  It accidentally hard forked a few years later again, but at that time nobody used the old database layer anymore, so nobody cared.

In my experience almost any transaction with at least 1 sat/byte that is not double spent will go through eventually.  Even those sent in November 2017 did finally confirm in February 2018. 
It probably confirms this weekend, but it is hard to predict the mempool several days in advance.
However if you send it with 0.99 sat/byte, e.g. 1 satoshi less than its size in bytes, then it will probably never confirm.

I have to guess but I think it is the following:
sum of all bitcoin days destroyed / total number of bitcoin days if no bitcoin would have been spent.
The denominator, the total number of bitcoin days, is easy to compute.  At the moment it grows by roughly 14.5 million bitcoindays per day.
The numerator is just the sum of all bitcoin days destroyed by all transactions on the chain.
If no bitcoin is spent the percentage  goes down since the denominator grows, if many old bitcoins are spent the percentage goes up.  And if today all bitcoins were transferred all at once, the percentage would go to 100 %.

This is wrong.  If it isn't multisig it takes about 375 bytes without segwit and 420 bytes with segwit (p2sh).
Currently 99.99% of all segwit transactions use p2sh, since very few wallets/exchanges support sending to a bc1... address.  P2SH adds about 24 bytes per input of overhead so in this block maybe around 200 kb (I haven't counted the number of inputs).
The remaining difference is that the block contains more inputs than outputs, i.e. it clears up the UTXO set, which is a good thing.  So if these transactions were not segwit, they would still take up almost 1.4 MB and not fit into a single block.
@_date: 2019-02-12 12:32:00
Someone posted 35 MB of segwit transaction (20 MB discounted) yesterday and the miners are slowly grinding through them.  These seem to come from some payment provider who is accumulating small inputs from several segwit addresses to a single segwit address.  As they have lots of inputs they almost only consists of signatures and have very high segwit discount.
So I fear this is only temporarily until the transactions have all been processed.

It will probably stay until it confirms.  If it is not urgent, you can wait it out.  If you want to send out more transactions and you need to use the same funds, you may need to pay twice the fees to pay for both transactions.  I don't know how the details of the Ledger Live wallet, though.

So it is already under some load to keep the blockchain in sync, also there is more network traffic to the clients. Especially, if someone uses the same electrum server with a spammed address.
And there is the problem that some other services have similar problems and people are advised to use electrum instead. So more users accessing the same number of servers (may be even fewer number of servers, if other people have the same problems with their electrum-server).

No BIP141 is just one of the main segwit BIPs defining all segwit outputs, but it is not standardizing the derivation paths for deterministic wallets.  So you can use this tab for P2WSH 1-of-1 multisig or P2WPKH or P2WPKH wrapped in P2SH, and you can use arbitrary BIP-32 derivation paths.

There is something called dust limit in bitcoind, which should prevent to send someone less than a cent.  However, it is too low in my opinion.  Since the minimum fee was reduced to 0.01 mBTC (at the time when bitcoin broke 500$ and was steadily rising) the dust limit is only about 600 satoshi.  I think setting this dust limit to around 5 US cents should mostly avoid this problem. At least the people that get spammed get enough money to not feel that bad about it.  
Of course,  there will be people complaining, that the transactions of their fountains are never confirmed and others may run into problems when their wallet tries to sends the 2 cent change back instead of just donating it to the miners.  A lot of people were complaining when the dust limit was introduced for the first time.
If you want to change the dust limit for your full node, you can increase mintxfee (dust limit depends on it) or you can change it manually in the sources.  Of course, the miners decide which transactions go into the block so it's most important that they change it.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just about keeping your private keys safe and secure.  A hardware wallet helps you, but you need to understand how it works.
A hardware wallet keeps you master private key usually in form of a 12 or 24 word phrase.  It also asks you to write down this phrase in case you lose the hardware, or if the hardware wallet gets wiped during a failed update.  It is important that you take even more care with these 24 words than with your hardware wallet; everyone seeing these words can steal your coins at any time.  And if anything happens with your hardware wallet, these words are the only way to recover your funds.
The purpose of the hardware wallet is to store these words in a much more secure way than storing them on your phone, your harddrive, a USB stick, or even worse, your cloud space.  Malware cannot access the key on the hardware wallet, even when you plug it into your computer and sign a transaction.  Even the casual thief will have problems reading out the seed from the stolen hardware wallet (although hardware attacks get more and more sophisticated and a skilled thief may be able to circumvent the locks with special hardware).

I think nobody cared to implement a more extensive verifing SPV client, because there is no realistic attack scenario that would exploit this problem. It costs at least 25 bitcoin at the moment to produce a block with an invalid transaction and 150 bitcoin if you want six confirmations (and in that case you need a lot of hash power).  People dealing with this amount of money probably don't use SPV clients.  Also a six block invalid chain would quickly make it to the r/bitcoin front page.

Asicboost is more efficient for empty blocks, especially after the softfork in Greg's proposal activates.   Without the SegWit wtxid in the commitment there is a way to use ASICBOOST with full blocks efficiently by reordering transactions as Greg explains in his post, but when wtxid must be included, a viable alternative would be to mine empty blocks.
Much more efficient in any case would be using the version number bits, i.e. voting for SegWit in  50% of the blocks, or voting on undefined proposals.

You can do it really covert.  You need to manipulate two transactions, one in the first half of the block, one  in the second half.  The one in the first half is typically the coinbase transaction.  For the second half, you can mine some of your own transaction, leave out a few random transactions, or reorder some random transactions that pay exactly the same fee.
The collisions you produce are never published.  You cannot reuse them for a different block. There is nothing special about them.

Veriblock pays about 237600 VBK per day to the POP miners (created out of thin air), which are currently about 13000 USD.  This is how much miners are paid for bitcoin transactions on the chain. How much of the money the POP miners use to pay for transactions is up to them.  I wouldn't be surprised if most miners currently mine at a loss.
Mining requires paying the right fee: If you don't get your transaction confirmed in the first block, it only gets 1/4 of the reward for the second block and almost nothing beyond that.  So POP miners would pay higher fees to ensure their transaction gets included in the first block.

Rico told me that the EC computation is negligible, so most of the time is computing rip160(sha256)), which is a bit simpler than double-sha2 miners use.
And the reward for computing 2^52 hashes was 0.051 Bitcoin, which makes it more than 1000x more profitable than mining per hash.  The catch is, that the difficulty doubles every time they were successful (unless there are more puzzle transactions on the block chain).  
And before you think about investing into this business: you can't use existing ASICs and the maximum total award due to the puzzle transaction is 33 BTC.

No it doesn't.  If the sender sends from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address, the non-upgraded nodes don't check if the signature is correct.  They will happily accept the transaction once it gets a confirmation and think the transaction and all further transactions that spend on it are valid.

Finding matches in overt method is 16 million times faster than the covert method that Greg's post describe.  Finding matches in the covert method with the additional commitment in the coinbase that Greg proposes, or with putting a segwit commitment in the coinbase is 13 times slower, or 13*16 million times slower than the overt method.
The overall net gains is harder to answer.   If finding the covert collision takes 1 % of the time without the 13x slowdown, then with the slowdown it would take 13 % of the time and eat most of the additional profit.  If it takes 0.01 % of the time, then the 13x slowdown would be negligible.  If it takes 20 % of the time, then the covert method of asicboost wouldn't be profitable in the first place.
Instead of finding a single 4-way collision as described by Greg's post, it makes more sense for a mining pool to compute 2^32 random hashes instead of 2^24 and get 700 million 4-way collisions (if my math is correct) for just 256 times more work. I guess, a few powerful machines with some hardware hash accelerators should be enough to provide the necessary collisions for the whole mining pool, so the 13x increase in number of hashes should not matter that much.

They are partially mining their blockchain by sending bitcoin transactions (Proof of Proof).  The idea is that instead of spending electricity, they spend BTC transaction fee, and they get a block reward for this.
The block reward is fixed and valued in Veriblock and it is equally split under all miners whose transaction confirmed in time.  So the more BTC transactions the miners send, the less VBK they get for each transaction, and the system should theoretically find an equilibrium.
The advantage of POP is that, in case of a 50 % attack, you can't mine completely in secret.  You can withhold the blocks, but you need to send the BTC transaction, and everyone would know that someone is mining a conflicting chain.

Okay, lets fix the terminology.  If you receive a transaction whose output script contains your plain address, but which spends an output that was paid to a SegWit script, then a fully verifying but not upgraded node will think that this transaction is valid and accept it, even if the signature (which is not part of the transaction for SegWit) is invalid. You have to trust the miners that they will not include the transaction in a block if the signature is invalid.
In other word, if someone pays you and he uses SegWit or was once paid by someone who uses SegWit, then you have to trust the miners or upgrade your full node.  Note that your old node would not even warn you that somewhere a SegWit transaction was involved.

This is my node.  At that time I got a mail from my provider that there was a failure at the node and that they're fixing this.   If the server shuts down cleanly it safes the mempool to disk (since version 0.14). But in this case it was a hard shutdown, so the mempool wasn't saved.  You can also see the 80 minutes where the server wasn't running when my provider was still working on it.
I think it took until a few hours ago for the mempool to recover and all I can do is wait until the transactions are rebroadcasted.  So everything before that is not accurate, although I think it really cleared to the 80 sat/B level.
You may notice that the 100-120 level is now smaller and 120-140 a bit bigger.  I fixed a rounding bug, so that now all transactions with exactly 120 sat/B are in the 120-140 range.  Previously about half of them were in the 100-120 range.
I'll see that I get a second server set up soon, so that if it happens again, I still have a second set of data.

I doubt that you can prevent AsicBoost without a hard fork (and then you have to be very careful not to break other existing mining hardware).  One can use the overt method and signal for different soft forks (make the coinbase header look like for an anonymous solo miner, so that the random voting behaviour is not obvious).  The only way to prevent this is to force everyone to signal the same soft forks, which makes signalling pointless.
Even if you soft fork out the overt method, the covert method should still be possible for large pools that can centralize the collection of colliding merkle hashes.  I outlined this here:

How low is it?  The [mempool]( isn't that full at the moment and is emptied every few hours to the 80 sat/B level, so just waiting a while may solve this.

In that sense, it is not an attack as it still takes at least difficulty * 2^32 operations on average to find a solution.  The inner loop got a bit optimized by reusing an intermediate result for many iterations, but if you call this an attack, then you may also call using the mid-state an attack.

If you received a lot of small valued transactions, you have to sign them each individually, when you want to send the bitcoins again.  Then, your transaction gets larger. Large transactions need to pay more fee than small ones, so fee is usually given in sat/B. For example, 130 satoshi/B is 1.3 mBTC/kB.  Also spending the money from about 6 transactions is 1kB.  The good wallets can tell you the size of the transaction when you choose the fee, or just ask you for the fee per kB, so you don't have to calculate yourself. 
Currently I'd say 130 sat/B is a okay if you don't want to wait hours for confirmation and still be somewhat cheap.  A lot of transactions are currently about 120 sat/B, so paying a bit more is useful for fast confirmation. Predicting the right fee is a science of its own, though.  On the weekends you can often (but not on every weekend) pay less than 10 sat/B and at very busy times you need to pay more than 200 sat/B for instant confirmation.   Check  for a suggestion (although they are usually a bit high).  
And don't trust the time estimates.  There is no countdown that will ensure that you transaction is taken when the clock runs to zero.  The miners choose the transactions with the most fee first, even if there is a transaction that pays only a little less and waited for two days.

Segwit doesn't break the covert method; it only makes it 13 times slower (for full blocks containing at least one segwit transaction; a miner is free to choose to not mine segwit transactions to avoid this).  
On the other hand the covert method detailed in Greg's posting is 16 million times slower than the overt method (e.g. signalling for bip-109 and segwit in some of their blocks).
So they block segwit for a 13 times speed-up  (which they would still have if they just don't mine segwit transactions), but they are afraid of implementing a 16 million times speed-up because some people think that using a patented method for which they have the patent in China is an attack against their competitors?

If security of SHA-256 is decreased to 2^61, we would certainly need to hard fork everything, or probably just give up on bitcoin.  Transactions, signatures, immutability of the Blockchain, even hierarchical deterministic wallets, all depend on security of SHA-2.

If it is just a constant, how does it protect against reordering transactions?


Reading this again makes me wonder, what is a correct WTXID commitment and how is it different from a BIP-141 segwit commitment?  BIP-141 only defines one kind of commitment and this even requires the coinbase to have a witness.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:26:01
You should probably not call it "WTXID commitment" but the "Merkle Tree Hash" where the coinbase txid is replaced by 00...00.  It is the same as the "witness root hash" in BIP-0141, but this wording makes it clear that witnesses and computing wtxids is not needed.
As I understand it, this soft fork may be activated before segwit activates. 
There is the problem that a node that doesn't receive witnesses cannot check conformance of this new rule for incoming blocks, since it doesn't know the wtxid of the transactions or the "witness reserved value" to check the segwit commitment.  Is it assumed that every miner should run a segwit-enabled gateway node that checks incoming blocks against this soft fork?
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:56:28
Yeah, this small soft fork just forces everyone to put a SegWit commitment into the coinbase.  What reason can Bitmain have to object to it? /s
Edit: See nullc's post, the wtxid commitment mentioned in the BIP is really just the Merkle Tree Hash and is intended to be segwit-neutral.

If a majority of miners don't run UASF, then all nodes that don't upgrade to UASF will not accept the UASF chain, since there is a valid chain with more proof of work.
UASF is only safe, if miners are so intimidated that a majority will run UASF (and explicitly 51 % attack non-segwit-signalling blocks).  Given the current situation, I find this very unlikely.  In every other case a single miner that doesn't signal for segwit will cause a chain split, and we have the same problems as for an unsafe hard fork.  Everyone (miners, users, exchanges) who doesn't upgrade will follow the non-UASF chain.
It would be ironic if the non-UASF chain would also activate segwit and does it quicker, due to more miners and thus faster blocks.  Which chain would the economic majority follow then?

Difficulty will retarget in about 13 hours and that will already have some relieving effects.  I don't see any huge backlogs in the near future; so far the backlog clears every night.  We may see some backlogs that go on for a week, but it is hard to say what is due to increased used (November usually has higher transaction count), and what is due to moved mining power.
Also if this is a fair hash fight (and this is what it currently looks like), then their is no need to pump money into it to carry this on for much longer.

Your scenario is unlikely to happen.  If the miners don't coordinate and get a majority to switch at the same time, their blocks will just be orphaned.  It is much more likely, that miners never accept UASF from the beginning and just ignore the UASF chain that starts on August 1st completely.  You get two chains, most miners are still on the chain where not signalling segwit is allowed and a few miners are on the UASF chain.
Other scenarios:
- Miners could double-soft fork and censor all segwit transactions.
- Miners could signal segwit support but not support it.  Then the first block that violates new rules leads to a split (provided non-segwit miners have majority of hash power).
- If a big number of miners don't support segwit, someone may misuse them for selfish mining.  Just withhold a witness in the block, so it is not valid for segwit miners, but valid for non-segwit miners leading to a temporary split and then publish the witness later to force a reorg.

About 1% of all blocks since segwit activated are not including any witness and are thus candidates for covert AsicBoost.  Most of the recent non-empty blocks are from BitcoinRussia, so we should probably investigate whether they are using AsicBoost.


Yes, that is the kind of "evidence" that was given.  A small Chinese mining pool (the only google results I found linking 1hash to bitmain are all about this issue), fucked up and produced an illegal block shortly after Greg described covert AsicBoost.  They put transactions in the wrong order, which is one of many ways to do covert AsicBoost (another way is to include a custom transaction somewhere). The problem could also be caused by doing other optimizations (e.g. the algorithm that prioritises which transaction to mine).  But it was in July 2017 so it must be AsicBoost.  Other kind of evidence is Antpool produced lots of empty blocks (which is kind of contradicting the story that they block segwit for reasons of AsicBoost, since covert AsicBoost also works with segwit if you produce empty blocks). 
My feeling is they experimented with AsicBoost using the overt method, found that it didn't give the power savings they hoped for (maybe their design was not that good) and abandoned it.  It seems strange that they would go to the length of doing it covertly given how much more difficult it is than just doing it overtly.  Especially considering that they have the patent in China, so they could use it overtly in their own mining farms.
Has someone measured how much energy enabling (overt) AsicBoost on an Antminer actually saves (pinging I found posts where he managed to enable it using some tricks, but I couldn't find the power savings he achieved.

Still 2^160 is so large that this is only theoretically.   You would need the hash power of the full bitcoin network for a year or so to generate two brainwallets with the same addresses.   Then you can steal from yourself :)

I'm doing "unnecessary UTXO sweeps" on my wallet every few months when the fees are going down.  It saved me a lot of transaction fee when I had to do a transaction in December.
If Bitpay wouldn't do this they would probably need to charge something similar to what other exchanges charge for **deposit** fees (dollars instead of cents).
But you are free to start your own payment provider, if you think there is a lot of money that can be made from these fees.

The main purpose of the bootloader is to check the signatures of the firmware and erase the secret key when someone installs an unsigned firmware. 
Thus with a hacked bootloader you don't get the assurance that the firmware is genuine and the bootloader itself could have some backdoor to send the secret keys when started with some button pressed (bootloader is only active during startup, so once the firmware runs, the bootloader can't do anything).
Replacing the bootloader can only be done with physical access (or you need to trick the person to install a backdoored firmware and click away the unofficial firmware warning).  The main attack scenario is selling manipulated Trezors as "slightly used".  Before Saleem found this, we thought it was impossible to replace the bootloader.

Have you checked the age of these transactions?  I have the feeling that some miners seem to prefer fresh transactions.  Maybe stupid mempoolexpiry setting, which means they forget transactions after few hours? 
EDIT: Just checked it.  It really looks like they set `mempoolexpiry=1` meaning expire after one hour.  Most transactions are less than an hour old and the few older ones were probably just rebroadcast.

It is [publically known]( how to activate overt AsicBoost on existing Antminers.  These devices are in use all around the world under different jurisdictions (including those where even running a miner is illegal).  If this switch would really work and save millions of dollar, why did nobody use it?  They can't be all scared about Timo Hanke's patent.


The only real evidence I have seen is that the Antminer have the switch to do overt AsicBoost.  Nobody has even bothered to post performance figures of how this switch affects hash efficiency.


Did you do a scientific study or is this anecdotal evidence? (all three Chinese miner company owners I asked were pro-asicboost and anti-segwit1x).

Yes, this article underlines my point.  You can even see that the spam transactions paused during the high fee event in November/December 2016 (if you can call 20 cent per transaction a high fee).  In January 2017 the final transaction from the coinwallet.eu stress test was cleaned up.

They want [12 cent additional fee]( to be able to forward the payment to the exchange.

Has anyone measured the consensus for no2x?  There will be a split in November and then it is probably the first time, we can objectively measure economic majority (if you assume that price measures economic majority).
There is no need to discuss this.  There was already the signalling period and 90 % of the miners signaled for segwit2x.   The fork can only be averted by a new agreement to fork back to 1 MB blocks.  I doubt there is still time to roll out such a new fork to 1 MB, and I doubt even more there is enough consensus to do this.


We already had two major fee events this year and I doubt that the current 0.5 % capacity increase that SegWit brings, will be enough.  You can argue that bitcoin doesn't want to be cheaper than western union, but even bitcoin.org mentions low processing fee as a feature of bitcoin.  I guess 10 % SegWit related capacity increase until the split in November is still an optimistic estimate.  Let's see if the short fee explosions are enough to keep people from using bitcoin.  If you look at the transaction statistics it seems to work well at the moment.


That works both ways.  Does no2x plan to introduce opt-in replay protection so that we have at least opt-in two way replay protection?

It would be good to make a standard out of it.
Why do you use 12 bit for SSSS?  Wouldn't 11 bit be more natural, as you already have the packing into 11 bits due to the word list?
I think it would be good to add some checksum or even ECC code to the end of the share.  This would be applied to each share after the sharing process, so that you can check and correct errors in each share separately.
Putting a version field into the second word would be useful to make it more future proof.

Okay there are two primes *p*, the field size, and *n*, the order of the generator G.   A private key *d* is simply a number between 1 and *n*-1.  The public key *Q* = *d*G is a point on the curve, which consists of two coordinates x,y both between 0 and *p*-1.  For every x coordinate there are either two or zero y coordinates such that the point lies on the curve.  If you count all the valid x coordinates, there are exactly (*n*-1)/2 of them, which results in n-1 public keys.
So the number of private and public keys is the same, but their representation is quite different.  The most compact representation of a public key takes 257 bits (256 bit for x plus one parity bit for y) but only about every second of them is valid.  Its not exactly every second and this takes care of the difference between *p* and *n*.

okay, after setting `LDFLAGS="-nostartfiles"` configure runs through.
Having a way to remove all malloc code and produce constant tables instead would still be useful.


The doublings are only needed when multiplying with arbitrary points (point_multiply) not when multiplying with the generator (scalar_multiply).


Sorry, it is ECIES not ECDH.  It's an implementation of  in TREZOR.


I blind the first point.  What then happens is that every point from the table in affine form is first multiplied with the Z coordinate (squared resp. cubed).  In principle even the move operations before the multiplication may leak but there is no way to avoid that.
I though about scalar blinding, but that would require to store the blinding value in the permanent storage (computing it in the same session is probably not a good idea) and I wanted to keep the changes small.

Isn't it the same with Bitcoin?  The bitcoin miners are paying the fiat cost for electricity and are paid back in newly minted BTC. The transaction fee is only a tiny fraction of their reward and the miners pay much more for electricity. They sell the BTC on an exchange and get back the fiat and some profit.  And all new investors in BTC pay a small part of the the electricity cost.  You could also say the hodlers pay the cost by having the supply inflated, but who is paying the hodlers, who made money in the past?

It's a very very slow quantum computer that cannot break a secp256k1 key in under 10 minutes.  It takes about the same number of operations as computing the public key from your private key on a normal computer.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:07:45


Adapting the secp256k1 code would also have produced some new code that had to be reviewed, e.g, some code to pre-compute the tables so they can be put it in flash memory. And the existing code would have to be adapted, while carefully checking that the function contracts still match.  Getting the code to compile with the ARM compiler is also non-trivial. A simple `./configure --host=arm-none-eabi` does not work.  Then one has to remove the references to `malloc`, etc.
My code is not slower.  It is about the same speed and uses half the table size (for multiplication with G).
Also is point multiplication with other numbers than G constant time in secp256k1?  I don't think so, but this would be necessary for the ECDH code in TREZOR.
In case you wonder about pre-computed tables: the TREZOR has about 20kb of free memory (at the moment), and no malloc support (adding this would decrease the available memory).  There is still about 200kb of free Flash, though.


Yes that is fixed.  I already planned to fix it at the time I wrote the code but I wanted to get something working first.


It is randomized (in the initial step Z is set to a 255 bit random number).  The main purpose of the randomization is to prevent the multiplications of point_add producing some characteristic emissions (something that is more a theoretical attack; I cannot detect such emissions), but it also protects the final bn_inverse.  You can argue that the random number is not completely uniform and since it is multiplied over and over the final Z coordinate is basically multiplied with the random number to the power of 4^64.  
My biggest fear is not that the code is susceptible to a timing attack (the additional PIN barrier added in 1.3.3 should prevent most scenarios) but rather that it is incorrect in some rare circumstances, leading to computing a erroneous public key for which no private key is known.  My code succeeds for all unit tests, but of course this only says that it is correct in most cases.  I gave invariants for most loops I introduced and added similar invariants for the existing code, but these invariants are only manually checked. More code review and more tests would, of course, be welcome.

Don't worry, there is no quantum computer that can do Shor's algorithm with enough qbits yet. I was just saying that you don't need many operations so 10 minutes would be ample time to break a key, once you have working universal quantum computers.  Even the first classical computers didn't need hours to multiply a few numbers. 
How do you even protect old keys? Do you think a patch to blacklist all ecc keys including Satoshi's stash would be acceptable?  I guess the one who manages to build the first quantum computer able to break ecc will be very rich.

The miners get rewarded with newly minted coins that are minted according to a fixed schedule (similar to BTC).  Like in BTC, at some time transaction fees from veriblock transactions (to secure other blockchains) should pay the miners.
The Veriblock tokens have value mainly because people believe that someday Veriblock will be useful (AFAIK, they don't have the first application for Veriblock, yet).
My main problem with Veriblock is not this, but that their consensus critical specs, e.g. the exact reward schedule, is undocumented, closed source (obfuscated Java class files), and probably buggy (floating point operations without strictfp).

You need the master public key to see that two public keys belong to the same wallet.  As long as you don't leak the master public key, you privacy is preserved.  There are other ways to link public keys, though, e.g. if you spend from both addresses in the same transaction, or if you query all your addresses from some electrum server that logs your activity.
This holds for public derivation.  There is also private derivation, for example, if you have multiple accounts on the same wallet.  In that case, there is no master public key and only the master private key can be used to link an address from one account with another from a different account.

Good question. This is one I asked myself for some time. 
The reason is that the three points involved in a point addition all satisfy the equations `y = s x + c` and they are also on the curve `x^3 + ax + b = y^2`.
So `(s x + c)^2 = x^3 + ax + b` holds for these points,
which simplifies to
    x^3 - s^2 x^2 + lower order terms = 0
We know that the x coordinates of the three points x0,x1,x2 are the solutions of this cubic equation, hence
    x^3 - s^2 x^2 + lower order terms = (x - x0) (x - x1) (x - x2)
comparing the x^2 term on the left and right hand side gives
    s^2 = x0 + x1 + x2
The argument is a bit magical but it is sound.  
But I still don't know *why* associativity holds.  You can check it by expanding the equations but this gives not really an insight. The wiki article has a "geometric explanation", but it leaves the question open why the lines intersect in a common point.

I don't understand why still some miners don't filter out these 1000 satoshi dust outputs.  It is as simple as setting minrelaytxfee to 2000 satoshi (preferably a bit more to avoid the next spam attack).  This also keeps the spam transactions from entering the memory pool.
Or is the profit from the spam transaction so big that it offsets the costs of keeping the UTXO list and mining the clean-up transactions later?

Not really, you can only get ahead by not propagating at all. And how do you magically speed-up the propagation of your blocks if the other found a block? If you can't do this your blocks will be the one that get rejected.
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:10:32


I read this a lot, but this is plain wrong.  Selfish mining means to not propagate the block at all until the right time comes and then to propagate it as fast as possible, in the hope to be faster than the conflicting block.  It doesn't work if your blocks propagate slowly.

I just suggest to raise the minimum transaction fee to half a cent (the practical fee is much higher).   I don't think it will affect any reasonable uses of bitcoin.  If it will prevent some other people to send quarter of cents around, that is not bad.  The dust will just be a nuisance to the receiver, because he needs more transaction fees to spend it than it is worth.
The reason this spam attack is profitable for the spammer, is that miners don't recognize that, when including the clean-up transaction, these spam transaction pay only 10000 satoshi per KB, less than the regular transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-21 05:34:32
The effect of not propagating or slow propagation is that you lose some rewards. You have more stale blocks than your competitors. Selfish mining is only profitable if you manage to get two blocks ahead without revealing your blocks at all. If your blocks are propagated slowly at this point, you lose this advantage. Do the simulation! Also if your blocks are propagated slowly you may lose your private fork when you have to reveal it. This can happen if the honest miners find a block while your private chain is still not propagated very fast and is disastrous to your revenue.  
Selfish mining is not about no propagation or slow propagation, but about precise and fast propagation at exactly the right time.

If quantum computers arrive, they may be able to double-spend your coins in the moment you spend them.  10 minutes average block time should be plenty for a quantum computer to break the key and use RBF to double-spend.

The specific WNAF algorithm that is used now *is* constant time.  It performs exactly 63 jacobian_point_add operations.  There are three minor things that are not constant time left:
- The array access may have cache timing issues (you also mentioned this). One could do the trick that secp256k library does to work around this and read all memory cells.
- The `bn_mod` operations in `jacobian_point_add`; each is performed with a probability of one in 2^220 .  So in practice it is never performed and thus still constant time.  Also its input is randomized.
- The final `bn_inverse` operation when the Jacobian representation is converted back. However its input is just the randomized Z coordinate of the **public** key in Jacobian form.
The first point is what worries me most but I cannot find details for the cache architecture of the processor nor is there a chance to see the difference with the oscilloscope as I don't get any high frequency signal beyond 1MHz on the cable.

Yes. Note that the firmware doesn't choose the fee, but it displays a warning if it is unusually high.  The warning now only appears for more than 0.001 BTC/kB.   Since a higher fee than 0.0001 BTC/kB was necessary during the stress tests, this avoids a bogus warning. The fee is still displayed for every transaction.

At least these can be fixed by the user.  It is a technical hurdle but you can change the signature to low-s without knowing the private key (at least for standard transactions).  It may invalidate chains of pre-signed transactions but these were never safe due to malleability.
I think preventing to create new p2pkh outputs is more controversial.  And remember, the reason segwit was done as a soft fork was that users don't have to upgrade if they don't want to profit from the lower fees.
There is no need to complicate it. Technically, just limiting the non-segwit transaction size to, say, 100kB makes signature validation linear in the block-size.  And this is much safer than forbidding all non-segwit transactions. AFAIK transactions bigger than 100kB are non-standard.
@_date: 2016-10-31 22:04:57
No, the master key is not revealed when signing transactions.  Depending on how the wallet works, it may send the xpub to the server to search for incoming transactions, though.  Some wallets only send the individual child addresses, but some send the master public key for simplicity.
Exposing the master public key has some small risks in addition to the obvious privacy issue.  It has the same problems as reusing the same address (bad signatures can break the whole wallet and you are not safe against quantum computers).

Exactly, I'm wondering about that, too.  Does it require non-standard scripts?
If a miner creates such a block intentionally it will probably just hurt him.  With SPV mining the block may win, but I think miners now put a limit on how long they SPV mine.  Without SPV mining a "several quarter hours to verify block" would just be orphaned before it is verified.

If you're willing to use the experimental command line tool, you can actually hold ethers on your Trezor.  You can generate an ethereum address using the latest version of trezorctl (from python-trezor) and Trezor firmware 1.4.0 with
     trezorctl ethereum_get_address -n "44'/60'/0'/0/0" -d
to send them on, you need a **fully synced go-ethereum** fullnode running with the -rpc switch and do
    trezorctl ethereum_sign_tx -v "0.1 ether" -n "44'/60'/0'/0/0" -p 0xsomeotheraddress
Be careful with the path `"44'/60'/0'/0/0"` (especially the apostrophes).  If you get it wrong, you may lose the ethers (or at least you need to find out later which path you used). I'd also recommend to write down the path and keep it safe.  This will probably be the standard path, but BIP-44 support for ethereum is still in experimental stage.   If you need more than one address you can increment the last number in the path, i.e., `"44'/60'/0'/0/1"`.

The 0x2... at the beginning is mandated by BIP 9. There is no standard which bits asicboost can use, it looks like some pool uses bits 8-23, and another uses bits 12-23.
It looks a bit strange that they essentially set all the bits.  I would've expect them using 2-4 bits for AsicBoost and keep the remaining untouched.   So far only three different versions have been used: 0x20FFFF00, 0x20FFF000, and probably also 0x20000000 (impossible to be sure, though).  Maybe the hardware only supports 2-way AsicBoost and the implementation switches between all bits set and all bits cleared.

Actually the public key is not included in a bitcoin signature.  Only three bits are needed to recover the public key and the corresponding address from an ecdsa signature.   This uses a neat property of ecdsa that enables you to compute the signing public key from the signature (you can even create a random signature and then compute the public key that signed the message).
In the bitcoin blockchain the transactions always include both signature and public key, though.

There is no risk to a soft fork that has miner approval, but then why make it an UASF?  A soft fork that doesn't have miner approval has at least the same risks as a hard fork.  Users that don't upgrade will ignore the UASF chain, as it is the shorter one.

They are not invalid; They use op_return outputs to store 40 bytes of data each, which is standard since a few years (but some bock explorers may still show this as an unknown address).  I have no idea what this data they store is good for.

There is no "refund".  A transaction is kept in the mempool for a user configurable time, usually 72 hours, but if someone restarts his node, he may receive the transaction later and keep it longer.  Transactions are often resent from time to time, e.g. by the recipient.  In principle anyone can resend your transaction. You cannot be sure that a transaction was pruned from all mempools until you successfully double-spent it.

Just make the hard-fork also signal the existing segwit soft-fork.  Segwit would then activate as soon as the miners upgrade + 4 weeks, while the 2 MB hard fork would be activated after 1 year grace period (and at that time we would probably welcome this increase, because the blocks are full again).
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:16:45
Why should they bother? If UASF is mined by a minority, it is nearly unusable anyway until the first difficulty reset. The fees will explode to beyond 10 $ for a minimal transaction.  Even the majority chain will have heavy backlogs, if it is missing some 10-30% hashing power.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:33:00


Are you saying that it is not urgent?  Gavin had some ideas how long it takes to find a consensus and update.  It was urgent at that time, but now it is too late.
And who could foresee that miners would block segwit, when they were explaining over a year ago under which condition they would run segwit?  Who could have known that they would stick to their word?
I'd prefer if miners would run segwit. It wouldn't help much but at least most people here would hopefully stop blaming the miners for this problem that was created by ignoring it for two years.  Even if Segwit was already activated and 100 % in use, the blocks would be almost as full as a year ago.  But you probably think another scaling solution is not urgent.

Saw this only now.  Congratulation, you have managed to get one of the longest confirmation time at this fee level in history.
Click on 220-240 (since you paid 222 sat/byte) and then look up the time when you send the transaction and when it was confirmed.  And then click on 30d to get a feeling how often these backlogs at that fee level happened so far.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:27:47
With electrum you can show your coins (unspent outputs) and then regularly select the smallest coins and send them to one of your addresses using a low fee that only confirms over weekend. Do this from time to time especially when fees are low.  E.g. in April you could have done that for a few cents.

90c is a bit outdated.  The average tx size is 500 bytes. Currently bitcoind suggest 218 sat/byte fee for 2 block target, which corresponds to about $1.70 (at $1580 per btc).  I expect the fees to rise further, when bitcoin goes through its [yearly cycle](
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:10:09
You can't fix quadratic signature hashing for non-segwit transactions without a hard-fork, anyway.  So saying we need segwit before we can do a block-size increase because of quadratic signatures is misleading. There is an easy soft-fork workaround, e.g. BIP-109 or something simple like rejecting transactions that call OP_CHECKSIG with more than 700 inputs without SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY (those transactions are currently not relayed by default because they are bigger than 100 kb).
Now that segwit is ready, we should do it first.  A hard fork would take more time, and I don't buy the "segwit as a hard fork is much cleaner" argument. But IMHO segwit with its 50% capacity increase (75% when non-p2sh addresses are supported) will not be enough long term.  By the time it activates and everybody sent their bitcoins to segwit addresses we may have a stronger fee pressure than today even with the added capacity.
It's hard to say when lightning will be ready and lightning will also need more capacity to allow more users. Some core developers stated that any hard fork would take a year after it is released to be activated, so if another capacity increment is needed in 2018, it should be started to be coded now.

Nice work.  I would suggest to display blocksize in multiples of 1000 bytes instead of 1024 bytes.  AFAIK, most parts of bitcoin use units of 1000 bytes (fee is in satoshi per 1000 bytes, blocksize limit is 1,000,000 bytes).
Also, is it intentional that the unconfirmed gauge flickers around on update? Probably it does it only if there are &gt;8000 unconfirmed transactions...
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:00:53
Take a look at 
How much sat/B did you pay (blockchain.info shows this)?  If it is 120 sat/B,  then your transaction is in the huge orange area together with 80,000 other transactions  that  all pay almost the same fee.  For that fee level a 0.5 sat/B difference can make a huge difference in confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:49:37
If it comes to a split, there are two kinds of bitcoins, UASF and the old chain. If you send transactions after a split happens on August 1st they can often be replayed, since there is no replay protection.  So you're spending both kinds of coins at the same time.  But if you receive bitcoins, then, even if they have confirmations, they may be only on one chain and it may be the wrong chain that later loses or is worth less.
You can sit it out and wait until the dust settles.  Either one chain will be abandoned or wiped out, or the two resulting bitcoins now each have their own value and you can trade them independently.   At that time there will be probably instructions how to safely split your coins.

Has anyone looked into how much more bandwidth was consumed due to RBF and CPFP transactions?  Also unconfirmed transactions are usually continually resent, which also adds some bandwidth.
There was also a suggestion of a new feature for bitcoind to automatically resent transactions with a higher fee and RBF after every block.  I wonder how many nodes can handle 100 MB backlog to be resent after every block.

Bip149 activates on timeout (July 2018), but bip 148 didn't change the activation logic at all.  It will only reject all blocks that don't signal readiness or that build on those blocks.  It still requires 2016-4000 blocks until it will activate (depending on how far we are in the difficulty period on August 1st) and then another 2016 blocks until segwit is enforced.
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:08:37
But BIP-141 doesn't automatically follow BIP-148 until the UASF chain is the longer one.  So if the miners switch after a few hours/days (best case scenario for UASF) all BIP-141 users are exposed to double-spends during this time.  If miners never switch, then we get two coins, and a big fight which one is the real bitcoin.
If a three month activation period for a hard fork isn't safe, why should UASF be safe especially with less than three month preparation and a big controversy.

I think it is related blockchain.info.  Most of these transactions originated there (according to their blockexplorer). They had 65 sat/B until February 22 and then changed it to 120 sat/B.

This is (almost) impossible.  You cannot spend existing standard p2pkh outputs with segwit transactions (that would be a hard fork) so if you soft fork non-segwit transactions away this would devalue all the currently existing coins.
Usually, a soft fork does not change the behaviour of standard transactions, e.g. to allow time-locked pre-signed transaction to go through even after a decade.
@_date: 2016-05-28 08:44:09
You can try to run the boot loader (press both buttons while connecting the Trezor).  Then you can reflash the firmware.  Although if it goes to the homescreen without warning, the firmware is fine.
Also try with different computers. Sometimes some usb mouse driver or similar can block the Trezor.

Can you try to explain how this can theoretically work?  How much of the 300 BTC fee per day is spam produced by miners?  How can the spammers recover the fees mined by the other miners? You can easily check that almost every transaction was sent to all miners.  Also note that many mining pools also give the fee to their workers.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:58:14
I see, you were talking about the 30 BTC fee that were under 90 sat/byte and not confirmed last week.   I was talking about the 150 BTC that were pending at the peak and the hundreds of BTC that were confirmed in the last few hours.

I think you can just make another backup of your current wallet.dat file, and then replace that file with the old backup (don't run the bitcoin client while doing this).  Then you don't have to wait for the new wallet to sync up.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:48:29
If you're a big player, you can have direct contracts with large mining pools to get (almost) guaranteed confirmation times for your transactions for a fixed price.
Otherwise for transactions you receive, you can use CFPF to pay the fees for the customer, i.e. send the money you receive to yourself with a high fee so that miners can only pick up this extra fee if they mine both transactions.   For transaction you send, you can use opt-in RBF and just compete in the fee market.  Currently it is still easy to compete, since most people aren't aware that this is an option.  The fee market is still at 2–­5$ per kB even at the busiest time.  It will probably get much more expensive when every wallet chooses competitive fees and enables opt-in RBF by default.

The artifacts are quite interesting.  The server runs 0.13 with the previous default timeout of 72h (0.14 changed that).  On May 3 at 0:00 (UTC) the server was restarted and I copied the mempool from my server to giszmo's.  You see that exactly three days later these transactions reached their time limit and were removed.  I think I then tried to add them manually again, some where added a few hours later.  Then exactly three days later again there are more drops, each corresponding to a raise three days earlier.  These repaired themselves because most transactions are resent from time to time.
The artifact today is the mempool reaching the 300 MB limit (a transaction in memory takes up more space than in a block and the statistics counts the number of bytes it takes up in a block).  You can see the same on  which also runs at 300 MB limit.
Edit:  doesn't have the artifacts since it is running 0.14 with 2 weeks timeout and I recently manually increased the mempool size to 500 MB.  There is a small artifact in the night to May 6, when the mempool limit was hit before I increased it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:42:03
Most of the backlog is around 120-122 sat/B, because some service (I think blockchain.info) aims for 120 sat/B (and since transaction size depends on signature they may pay a bit more).  So 132 sat/B avoids this huge backlog.  Still bitcoind fee estimate suggest at least 137 sat/B for 25-block confirmation (4 hours).
You may also ask cryptolution what he means by "stable fee market": 
The post even mentions that fees stabilized to 0.50 $ or 0.90 $ for urgent transactions, which doesn't really pass a reality check (average transaction size is around 500 bytes)

Where do you get your alternative facts?  My mempool shows around 180 k transactions yesterday and around 180k transactions today.   That is still a 40 k improvement over last week, but that is probably because users don't want to afford the transaction fees anymore. Note that you need to increase your mempool size, because by default the mempool can take only around 140k transactions.
  
Faster transactions were possible all the time; just pay your 2 $ for a minimum size transaction.  Although, antpool started to mine backlogged transactions from last week at 120 sat/byte ignoring the backlog from this week at 200+ sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:29:29

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 390 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.

With 120 sat/B it should have confirmed on each of the previous week-ends.  Are you sure that this is the same transaction you send in April?


It has two outputs.  Blockchain estimates that one of them is change and only the other output is the real transacted value.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:08:11
I think whoever sent them wants them to be confirmed.  They pay only 15 cents per transactions to save money.  I'm not sure why BitFury is accelerating these transactions, maybe they have a contract, or it is selected by BitFury's algorithm that prefers small transaction.
They want to put the data in the op_return outputs permanently on the blockchain.

When creating a new wallet some randomness sent by the PC is mixed into the randomness from the Trezor (by simple xoring).  If at least one of them is working properly, the generated seed is secure.
And it would take a major flaw of the RNG; a small bias would reduce the entropy by a few bits and make attacks only slightly faster.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:31:08


Note that their estimate is for the remaining wait time, not the total wait time and that it may be wrong.   With the Bitcoin mempool it doesn't matter how long you are already waiting, if a new transaction pays a single satoshi more fee it goes ahead in the queue.

As you may have noticed I followed your suggestion :)  Mempool is now at 133 MB (345 MB usage):  
I run 0.14.1 with the new default of 2 weeks timeout.  It will be interesting to watch if some transactions will be dropped in a few days.  Usually most of them are resend regularly though, so I expect a few temporary drops at low fee level and then shortly after they are back.

You never buy directly from Amazon, but from a reseller; I think Amazon will only handle the payment not the product/shipping.  There are some official resellers, see this thread  
The software running on the Trezor is protected/signed and it is impossible to replace it without opening the device (e.g. replacing the chip inside).  A big organization like NSA may do this; they can even produce their own Trezor clones and sell them on Amazon.  But I don't see, why they want to spend money on this. If you are paranoid, you can read out the full software including the bootloader and check it against the open source repositories. 


No, the private keys should never leave the Trezor.  It would be a serious bug if that is possible.  As long as you keep your seed secure (the 24 words that you need to write down on first initialization), there should be no way to get the private key.  However, everyone with read access to the USB port can read your public keys and addresses and thus watch all your wallets.  This is protected by PIN, but for convenience Trezor only asks once for the PIN until it is disconnected.
You can use Trezor with Firefox using Trezor Bridge.  It's not as well tested as the Chrome setup, though.  The main problem with arbitrary browser support is how to connect to the USB port from a web application.  I think every hardware wallet has the same problems.

I just learned that mempool size (usage) is  not transaction data size.  Due to overhead for storing the transaction in parsed form, 300 M correspond to only ~110 M serialized transaction data. 
You can see this on the bottom graph of  When the total transaction data size hit around 110M it evicted low fee transactions from the mempool (I run bitcoind with the default mempool size).
BTW, we also shattered the old total fee record of ~45 BTC from early March: we just had over 94 BTC unprocessed fee.

There is a **huge** backlog at exactly 120 sat/B (seems to be a default fee in blockchain.info).  Some of these transactions have been confirmed, but many are still waiting since Monday.   Transactions at 140 sat/B usually still confirm in a few hours, but there is currently an eight hour long backlog.  But I guess that last transaction will confirm over night.
See  These congestions started last week and this week the mempool is even a bit more congested.  It has just reached its default limit again and very low fee transactions (&lt; 20 sat/B) are erased from the mempool (I run my nodes with higher limits, though, therefore my statistics doesn't show it).

It's a combination of several things.  First a few slow blocks driving fees into the 300+ sat/byte region.  Then someone sent large transactions that combine multiple inputs, first at 300 sat/byte then even at 400 sat/byte.
Normally these big transactions that clean-up wallets occur over the weekend at low fee, but we haven't seen fees lower than 90 sat/byte over the last weekend.
I think the worst is over now.  300 sat/byte transactions have been mined.
EDIT: BTW, at the peak the 200,000 unconfirmed transaction were paying over 150 BTC fee in total.  If it was spam, that was very expensive spam.

The mempool is limited to 300 MB.  This limit was hit today again and the bitcoin nodes just deleted the transactions that payed the least amount, in this case all below 4 sat/B.  These deleted transactions can be sent again as soon as there is free space again.  Also transactions are deleted after three days if they are not resent.
So far, almost all transactions confirmed; it may take a week or two, but eventually there is a less busy weekend.  I don't think this will be true forever, though.
Note that we have 300k tx that confirm per day.  So the 100 k that queued up over the last few days is just a small percentage of all transactions.  If you pay more fee than the bottom 20 %, your transaction will still confirm quickly.
You can see how the number of transactions goes up and down over time here: 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:51:13


We had briefly around 106k tx in February, but that record is broken now.  The old record is 197k tx though, which happened during the "stress test" in September 2015.  These were the only occasions where we went over 100k tx according to statoshi, which goes back to May 2014.
I'm pretty sure that 92 BTC fee in the mempool *after* a block was found is a new record we had today (there were transactions before that accidentally paid 200 BTC fee, but they weren't left in the mempool when a block was found).
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:37:52
Good timing of the post :).  One day has passed and now 21 suggests 280 sat/B, i.e. $1 for a median size transaction. Mempool is full again (last time it was full was in [November (!)](  And the rising bitcoin price not only means more transactions, but also that the same fees in Satoshi is now more fee in USD.
I wouldn't say the fee market has stabilized.  Currently there are still around 15 % transactions at 120 sat/B, since some wallet pays a flat fee.  It will probably raise the fee soon since 120 sat/B is not working at the moment.  This will probably lead to another fee jump like the one end of February when they raised it from 65 to 120 (you can see the jump in the block25 line of statoshi's fee estimates).  And we still haven't seen permanent backlogs; it will be interesting to see how the fee market reacts to them.

@_date: 2017-05-17 19:06:01
You are probably right; once the mempool clears the price may go down again, because other people are also trying to cash out and not succeeding to transfer their bitcoins.
At the moment you can send with about 180 sat/byte if you are not under time pressure (i.e. will confirm in 1-300 minutes).  You should be able to double-spent your old transaction because, with its low, fee very few nodes have remembered it.  
If you update to latest version of electrum (it can create a new wallet from a list of private keys), you can tweak your transaction to only spend the bigger "coins": Enable (Menu Wallet-&gt;Coins) and select the coins tab, select all coins with more than 0.001 btc, then right click, spend.  Enter destination address.  Make sure that the fee slider shows at least 1.80 mBTC/kBbyte (mine shows 2.4 at the moment at the lowest setting).  You should also enable RBF (also in the fee settings dialog), so that you can bump the fee later.  Then click "Max" in amount.
At 2 mBTC/kbyte you pay 0.0003 BTC per input as fee, so it doesn't make sense to spend the coins below 0.001 BTC at the moment.

Something like activating any scaling mechanism in time before we see 10 $ fees  for minimal transactions.  Segwit takes at least four weeks to activate and then a few months to a year to slowly convert the UTXOs to SegWit addresses.  When finally nearly everyone is using it, the blocks are probably still full.   Assuming, of course, that Bitcoin stays the number one cryptocurrency and continues to grow.


It is astonishing how much people take for granted if they get used to.  A few months ago I would have said if the average transaction fee goes over 1 $ that would be bad.  In the Bitcoin Capacity Increases FAQ from just five months ago there is the quote "We don’t expect fees to get as high as the highest seen in this table [1 $ per 250 byte]; they are just provided for reference."  Yesterday, we reached 2 $ per 250 byte.
We will see what we think is normal in a few weeks.  It is not unlikely that things will quiet down again when the current hype is over, like they did last month.  But the next backlog will come and fees will go beyond 5 $ per 250 byte.  
And if BIP-148 without miner support will happen ... can you imagine what the fees are if &gt;50 % of the miner power is mining a different chain?  I can't.  The last two weeks capacity was just 5% under the demand and the result is a doubling of the fee.

It is hard to say. Normally the mempool clears on Sunday night, but it is higher than ever. I think we will beat the 120 sat/B backlog, but this isn't sure.  Even then, it will probably only clear to the 60 sat/B level.
If your transaction is more than 100 sat/B there is a good chance it will confirm in the next 24 hours (without acceleration).  If it doesn't then it will probably take much longer.

You should always use toBuffer({size:32}) to make sure that it is correctly zero-padded.  Otherwise it will bite you after some time.  In this case it would create an address that is unspendable.
There is a similar bug in the bip-32 code in bitcore-lib.  However, this "only" leads to incompatibility with correct bip-32 implementations.

If I remember the terms correctly, the Segwit2x chain would be where BCU pays out unless core accepts the Segwit2x chain in the default configuration until December.  It depends on what chain the software accepts in the default configuration and BU should accept the Segwit2x chain.
Still a strange contract, where a few developers can release a new software version to change the outcome of this contract.

Tradeblock is a bit low this week, though.  I have around 170,000 txs in my mempool (I increased the limit to 500 MB though).  Another full node with default mempool size had 158,000 tx at its peak, which is also what statoshi shows.

11 sat/byte is not enough to fit in the mempool.  Every transaction below 58 sat/byte was removed from the mempool because the 300 MB space that bitcoin nodes reserve for unconfirmed transactions ran over.
And yes, this is not normal, this is the first time that happened.
You currently need to pay more than 30 times more fee for fast confirmation.  The reason is that you have received lots of small transactions that you can't economically spend at the moment.  If your wallet supports it, try to spend only from the addresses where you didn't receive the small inputs.  The small inputs aren't spendable at the moment, but you can wait/hope for better times with lower fees.
Honestly, I wouldn't spend at all at the moment with the fees being this high.
We have a three hour backlog at 300 sat/byte.

Yes, I think so.  Bitpanda may have a bigger problem if some of the transactions were just dropped.  They now need to figure out, which transactions need to be resent or better yet replace by a transaction that pays more fee.   The backlog from yesterday is slowly going back and we are almost at the fee level Bitpanda payed.
It's partly bitpanda's fault since they did not react to the backlog in time. On the other hand, their service is automatic and automatic methods are bad in adapting to new situation that never happened before, like a 20 hour backlog at 200 sat/byte.
You may also blame core devs or miners for letting the situation become this unstable.

I always wanted to do this.  Thanks, I now have the bootloader (BLv1.2.0 - metallic) and I am looking at that. I also have a classic first edition (BLv1.2.5), but that stores some Bitcoins that I don't want to lose :)
The bootloader source code was added to the trezor-mcu in October (BLv1.2.5) so that bootloader looks quite different.  Also you have to hack it to compile without the stack_protector, which was added to trezor-mcu shortly before the bootloader was added.  I also have no idea, which libopencm3 version was used.
From a first look the bootloader v1.2.0 looks bigger than what is in trezor-mcu but the few functions that I looked at so far are the same.  Could be some code was factored out after v1.2.0 that was not needed for the bootloader.  I will look further into it and see if I can make a kind of binary diff.
TL;DR there is no deterministic build and no source code for old bootloaders (it was added later). Therefore, it is hard to check it.

That's really strange.  I had tried an older version of Electrum + Trezor and it didn't ask for the seed.  I don't see a reason why it should know the seed and as you said it is a huge security risk.
If you choose "Create new wallet" instead of Recover, it doesn't ask for the seed and it works nonetheless.
I still wonder why electrum asks for the passphrase every time it starts, except when the Trezor is not connected (which shows that read-only access works without the passphrase).  Also it would be nice if plugging in the Trezor later would work.

120 sat/B have finally confirmed last night.  Even a few transactions below 100 sat/B confirmed.  Still, the busiest week so far and there are still 90 MB pending at lower fee that will not confirm soon.
On the other hand, the transaction demand is currently only 5 % over capacity  (90 MB backlog in two weeks and 2 GB were confirmed).


that's not very dynamic :)  There is a reason why there was a wall of 100,000 unconfirmed transactions at 120 sat/B.   And that is related to blockchain's default fee.  If they change it, fees will probably double again.

Yes, pre-image attacks get cheaper, but it gets only as cheap as collision attacks are today. Usually the hash length is already chosen such that the hashes are collision resistant, so they should be secure.
I just checked and indeed collision attacks can also be done faster with quantum computers, but the difference is small.  There is an algorithm that reduces the complexity to about 2^100 for SHA-256.  But probably SHA-256 will be broken by classical computers before it can be broken by quantum computers.

If you use the backwards compatible p2sh addresses the transactions are about 10 % larger because they need an extra input script (25 bytes) that is not part of the witness data.  The overall savings is only 35 % instead of 45 % with P2WPKH without p2sh wrapper.

There is no way to actively drop a transaction.  Anyone can resend it as the signed transaction is now public knowledge.  Newer bitcoin nodes hold it for two weeks while older nodes hold it for three days.  But after they drop it, they will accept it again the moment someone resends it.  This is probably why it now appears with a new date.
The only way is to keep retrying to resend the transaction with more fees and hope that enough nodes have dropped the old transaction so that they accept the new one.  Double spending is hard by design and some wallets make it even harder by not allowing you to create a double spend transaction.

Normally these malware only steal electrum wallets, but you never know.  It could also install key logger, root kits, or retrieved other files from you computer.
As I understand it, your electrum wallet is empty.  Delete it so that you don't accidentally use it in the future. The scammer definitely has the seed words of this wallet and probably set up a program that watches for incoming payments.  If you want to keep the history, make sure you name the wallet file so that in five years you still know that the wallet is compromised and you should not send any bitcoins to it.

Yes, I would even say that many full nodes that run 24/7 do not have any bitcoins for security reasons.
A full node that you run on a hosted server helps to onboard other nodes by sending them historic blocks (you usually have good bandwidth), can be used to sync personal full nodes that don't run 24/7, it can be used by SPV nodes, and you can use it yourself to securely and privately interact with the network without running a full node on your home computer/laptop/mobile phone, where you have the keys for your bitcoins stored.

The witness part is the new thing that only segwit transactions have.  So the new thing is discounted, the old parts of a transaction are counted normally.
In segwit transactions the signature and pubkey doesn't appear in the input-scripts where they appeared before segwit, but they are moved into a new witness section that is discounted and which old pre-segwit nodes don't even see.

Payments are non-reversible, so only the owner of the receiving address can recover the coins.  Whether he will do this depends on who he is, how much money is at stake, and how difficult it is (e.g. segwit address is more difficult).

It's hard to predict how people will behave.  For example when fees raised to $ 20,  the number of new transactions only slowly declined, but they kept on declining even after fees were already at cents again.  Merchants are slow to add support and if they do and there are problems, they are reluctant to try again.
With larger block size, e.g. 2 MB, there would be no transaction backlog and fees would be at 1 sat/byte until the adoption slowly grows to make use of the extra space.  It's hard to predict how fast this happens, it can depend on a single project that make use of bitcoin.
The proposed fee market has some stability problems: If usage is at 90 % capacity, fees are low, if it is at 98 % capacity, fees rise but you can still do cheap transaction over then weekend, if it is at 101 % capacity, fees will rise without any limit until the usage drops below 100%  and the backlog slowly dissolves.  In January 2018 usage dropped to \~85 % and it still took weeks to dissolve the backlog.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:16:09
The blocks are limited to 4 megaweight, where 1 byte in the witness part (the signature) is 1 weight and 1 byte outside the witness part is 4 weight.  This means that the witness part is "discounted" by 75%.  So a non-segwit transaction of 200 bytes is 800 weight and a segwit transaction of 200 bytes is around 500 weight (assuming 100 byte witness). Many people now use the notion of vbyte (virtual byte) instead of weight (dividing weight by 4).
- 200 byte non-segwit tx = 200 vbyte
- 200 byte segwit tx = 125 vbyte.
My mempool graph shows everything in vbyte, so the fee is really in sat/vbyte and the mempool backlog is given in megavbyte. This means even a 1.3 MB block will remove only 1 Mvbyte from the mempool backlog.  I find it easier to think of a 1-input 2-output p2sh-segwit tx being 166 vbyte and using the sat/vbyte metric to estimate the fee than using the real size of 244 byte and subtracting the segwit discount.
So how big the blocks are (when they are full) depends on the number of segwit transactions and whether everyone uses 2-of-2 multisig segwit with bc1 addresses (2 MB), non-segwit only (1 MB), or the current mix of segwit and non-segwit transactions (~1.3 MB).  But measured in vbyte they are always 1 Megavbyte ;)

Yes, in the fiat world your bank has your money (edit: actually it hasn't; it already lent it to someone else), and they can reset your password, freeze your money, or just lose it in a global financial crises. 
In bitcoin the hardware wallet company doesn't have your bitcoins. The only way to access them are these 24 words (which are also stored on the hardware wallet) and you are responsible for keeping them safe. The company doesn't have a backup copy.
There are also custodial wallets, e.g., most exchanges, which will keep your bitcoins and allow you to recover if you lose your password. 
The bitcoin philosophy is to be your own bank and not trust third parties. This can be challenging and many people have lost their bitcoins by losing their keys or getting them stolen by malware or Phishing sites.

Routing is mostly private: Every node knows only from which node he got the money, to which he should send the money and a hash that uniquely identifies the transactions.  The other nodes, the length of the route, the final recipient, and the sender are not transmitted.  I think even the final recipient doesn't necessarily know the sender.  The sender knows everything, as he constructed the route (I think there is a proposal for an extension, where the recipient can specify the final part of the route in encrypted form).  If several nodes collaborate, they could try to recover more information by matching the hash value.  Also if the payment doesn't settle normally, the hash values could end up on the public blockchain linked to the channels where the payment failed.
The existing channels, their capacity, the nodes they connect (identified by their public key, their IP address, and their alias) is all public.  There is even the 1ml service where you can look it up for historic channels.  The balances are not public, but can be partially probed by trying to send payments and checking if payments fail.  Private channels are normally only known to the two parties, but are also published in the payment requests if the recipient is only reachable via a private channel.
The channel open/close transactions are recorded on the blockchain and together with the public information it should be easy to map them to the nodes, including the transactions that open/close private channels.  At close time, one can also determine the final balance, and find out whether the channel was collaboratively closed or force-closed by one of the two parties.

Brute-forcing the checksum is only marginally slower than brute-forcing any other part of the address: you pick a private key, compute public key, compute address, check if address matches your pattern.   If it doesn't match, you increase private key by one and repeat.  Only difference is that for the last part you need to compute the checksum, for the first part you can skip computing the checksum.
You can try yourself with [vanitygen]( which can be used to find an address with some fixed first or last characters.

Yes I remember.  Originally, in February, some core developers estimated Segwit being ready in April 2016, but that deadline turned out to be too optimistic.  They also promised a hard fork for three months later, that would bring 2 MB blocks (non-witness size) and activate in July 2017.  The miners promised in return to "run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core".
Due to SegWit being a larger change and the review taking time, it was only finished by October 2016.  A prototype for the promised hard fork was created in early 2017, but it would only bring the non-witness size of blocks to 2 MB in 2028. In the end, this was never released, as nobody wanted that.  For some strange reasons, the miners felt being cheated and didn't support SegWit at that time.

There is something called malleability in Bitcoin.  Although the digital signature prevents changing the signed content, someone may modify parts of the transactions that are not covered by the signature.  The most obvious part is the signature itself, or some internal formatting of the signature (e.g. adding leading zeros).  Especially for multisig transactions the other party that co-signed the transaction can change their signature to a different valid signature.
Malleating a transaction doesn't change how much money was sent from whom to who and cannot be used to replay transactions to pay them out twice.  The main change is the transaction id, which may confuse some services (e.g. MtGox thought that if one of their transactions with a particular transaction id didn't confirm, it is a good idea to just make the same payment again).  If the id changes, this also makes dependent transaction invalid: if Alice pays Bob before her withdraw transaction from an exchange confirmed and if the withdraw transaction gets malleated, her transaction to Bob is invalid and she could accidentally or deliberately never pay Bob and keep the money.
One important idea with segwit was to make the transaction id only dependent on the signed part, instead of the whole transaction including the signature.  This way the transaction id doesn't change, if the transaction gets malleated.

I have started a branch reconstructing the changes for v1.2.0.  
I'm not sure how far I want to do this, though. As you can see from the diff, there are mostly small text changes.  The different compiler flags explain why my boot image is much bigger (`-ffunction-sections` was not used).  I think I don't have the right compiler, yet, which also causes some differences.
**Update**: I think I have recovered most of the changes.  The bootloader v1.2.0 does not ask confirmation of firmware checksum, it has some different text and it has a hidden bigger set of digits (which are too large to fit in three rows on the display).  Most of the changes to the root directory are documented in the repository.  I still haven't figured out the compiler and the options I have to use to get an identical firmware, but mine is now very close.

Not all cryptography is broken by quantum computers, e.g., cryptographic hashes are fine.  Also symmetric cryptography is usually still fine provided you double the key length.  But discrete-logarithm based cryptography like RSA, DSA, or elliptic curve cryptography like ECDSA can be broken by quantum computers and using longer keys doesn't help.
There is ongoing research on post-quantum cryptography and some proposed algorithms for asymmetric encryption and signing.  Usually the price is huge key length and/or huge signatures.  Also they haven't been scrutinized as much as the currently used algorithms.

*The express trade over the Fidor API - fast, easy, and secure*
For the express trade it is necessary that buyer and seller agreed to the supplementary agreement.  Only the buyer needs a Fidor account.
*The express trade from the buyer's point of view*
You reserve some Euros in your Fidor account for buying Bitcoins.  You can choose the amount and the duration of the reservation.  Of course, you can cancel or change the reservation at any time. The reservation has to be confirmed using an mTAN that you receive via SMS from the Fidor Bank.
After a successful reservation you enter the Bitcoin market place and choose an offer that is marked with the Fidor logo.  You can filter the market place and only show those offers that are eligible for express trading.
You found an offer and want to buy the Bitcoins using express trade? You only have to click on "Jetzt sofort (über reserviertes Guthaben) kaufen" [buy now (over reserved credit)].  We will inform the Fidor Bank to transfer the money to the bank account of the seller.  If we get a positive reply (which usually happens within a few seconds), the Bitcoins are credited within a few minutes to your account on Bitcoin.de.  The balance of your Fidor account and the reservation will be reduced by the price of the Bitcoins.
*The express trade from the seller's point of view*
You agreed to the supplementary agreement and your offers are therefore marked with the Fidor logo.  Buyers with a Fidor account can buy your offered Bitcoins over a reserved credit.  Bitcoin.de informs the Fidor Bank to transfer the money to your account.  After the confirmation from the Fidor Bank the Bitcoins are credited to the buyer's account.  If you have a Fidor account the Euro should be credited to your Fidor account after a short time.  For other banks the money will usually arrive within 48 hours.

Segwit can use p2sh addresses (starting with 3, or 2 on testnet).  You can already send *to* these addresses with an existing client. Of course, you should wait until the soft fork is accepted; anyone can currently spend these outputs. For generating segwit addresses where you can receive money or send segwit transactions from you need to update your wallet. 
There are also plans for a native segwit address format with a new address scheme but that hasn't even be standardized yet.

no, only the latter.  scriptSig is not discounted and this results in blocks full of pre-segwit transactions being still limited to 1MB.   The scriptSig is empty for transactions from bc1 addresses.


Only for multisig transactions and 100 % segwit usage.  For a normal single signature transaction and 100 % segwit usage it is more like 1.7-1.8 MB, and even less if you use 3 addresses instead of bc1 addresses.  Currently, we see around 1.3 MB with 40 % segwit usage.
In the future with 100 % taproot usage, the maximum blocksize would be even smaller, around 1.5 MB, since the public key is no longer part of the discounted witness and multisig signatures are even a few bytes smaller than a single signature today.   This is a good thing, of course, since these transactions are smaller but provide the same functionality as the larger multisig transactions today.

It was only three weeks.  If the tx count in the mempool decreases, this means that the capacity was larger than the incoming transactions.
Although, what it showed is that 5%-10% incoming tx over the capacity can drive the fees up and lead to low-fee transactions being backlogged for several weeks (not hours!).  Also there is no good way to cancel transactions, as anyone can resend them (and someone does it), even after they timeout.
And we still see the high fees, since people value confirmation in a few hours over low fees.  You can easily pay 10 times lower fee if you're willing to wait a few hours, over night or maybe, worst case, two to three days at the moment.  But people still pay 300-400 sat/byte to get into the next few blocks.
The question is what do you want to suggest we should do when the next hype cycle begins?

For 1) you are trusting the service.  I think most of them will allow you to withdraw coins on all surviving chains. They learned from the etc debacle.
For 2) 3) 4) you are responsible.  If you don't transact after August 1st, you are fine. Just wait until the dust settles and then split your coin of it came to a chain split.  If you transact early August, you have to inform yourself about replay protection and check for incoming payments on which chains they arrived.

I think one problem is that it allows a segwit witness commitment instead of a non-segwit commitment.  However, the witness commitment can only be checked when segwit activates, since it needs witness data (at least the witness of the coinbase transaction) which is not even sent before segwit activates.   Hence, the new rules would not be enforcable before segwit activates, which makes it pointless.

One difficulty period starts probably a few days before August 1 and that will already have too many non-signalling blocks. So you have to wait until that ends, then one where segwit is locked in and one grace period before it activates.

I just followed the link and noticed that it directly redirects to Coinbase.  So you enter the login/password on the Coinbase site.  Checking the URL does not help.
It seems that by logging in you then enable the application "CoinApps" to have unlimited access to your wallet without any two-step verification (see the information on the left-hand side).  Have you reported this to Coinbase?  They should be able to blacklist CoinApps.  This probably doesn't help you, but at least it should stop them from continuing this scam.

The miner is offering a refund of the fee:
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:21:15
Thanks to the increased hash rate, you can send transactions now with a low fee of 20 sat/byte and have it confirmed over the weekend.  The suggested fee rate is only necessary if you need to confirm it in less than four hours.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:34:59
The fee estimators probably take small congestions into account like the one twelve hours ago where for four hours no transaction below 300 sat/byte was mined.  Most fee estimators aim for less than four hours confirmation time.

Trezor has [advanced recovery]( that makes recovery completely safe against keyloggers.  The old (non-advanced) recovery method is indeed insecure for 12 word seeds, especially if it is done twice.
But if OP lost the keepkey he should definitely transfer the coins to a new address.

If Segwit2x doesn't activate segwit before, and there is a uasf chain, then on that chain it will take about 2.5 difficulty periods. This means a month, if all miners switch to it. Or two months if support is at 25%.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:09:05
However, the average is more like 9 minutes due to increased hash rate.
Exponential distribution has a high variance.  The standard deviation is also 10 minutes, i.e. blocks take on average 10 minutes longer or shorter than the average.
And it is memory-less: even if you already waited for 10 minutes without a block appearing it will still take on average another 10 minutes.   On the other hand you often have two and sometimes three blocks in one minute.

It's best to use Linux to compile and run it. Install the essential builld tools, checkout the whole trezor-crypto repository (git clone  and run make.  The program is then compiled and can be executed. It reads the seeds from it's standard input. You then need a small script that shuffles your twelve words and outputs them if the checksum matches.
I can help you with the script that shuffles the words.  Are all words different?  Do you know the very first address of the main wallet (otherwise the script may try multiple addresses but this slows it down)?  Is it multisig or a standard address starting with 1?  Do you have the xpub (that would be even better than the first address)?

I actually experimented a bit with the first version of ledger nano (not S). It had some implementation flaws that led to leaked information of the private key.  The secure element might make advanced power attacks better protected, but the kind of leaks that my cheap oscilloscope can detect aren't masked by the noise generator.  They had the bug in the initial version of the firmware that a modular arithmetic operation leaked the fact whether there was wrap-around, which couldn't be masked by the noise generator.   This alone was enough to extract the secret key.  Also the algorithm they used leaked with how many 0 bits the private key started by both power analysis and exact timing.  Both bugs were fixed in a later version.  (Ledger nano always required the PIN to read the public key, so the attack was only useful if you had the device and the PIN but not the security card).
It's astonishing how much you can read from the power consumption pattern. I could tell them exactly how slow their implementation of sha-512 was (I could see the rounds) and they later produced a firmware where this part was at least a magnitude faster.  I still like to use the oscilloscope as a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks in the implementation are.
I think, a good thing is to try the attack yourself to better understand what the attack vectors are and how to mitigate them.  If you just use gray theory, you may have implemented the algorithm from the paper that is protected against all kind of side-channel attacks, but don't see that your compiler messed up the code, or the processor has a non-constant multiplication operation, which violates the assumption in the paper.  There was even the case of a sound attack against GPG that was only possible *because* GPG used a constant time implementation. I'd like to see what Cryptotronix found and to get ideas how to work around and harden the device against fault attacks.

There is no indication that there are even 10 % miners supporting UASF.  The 80 % figure is for Segwit2x. BIP-141 segwit has currently only about 30% miner support.  UASF probably much less (it can't be measured before August 1st, since there is no offical way to signal it).


but they are not compatible with a minority UASF chain, since they will follow the longest chain.  
shaolinfry always said that without economic majority UASF will not happen.  The question is how to measure economic majority.  If there are only a few exchanges promising to trade UASFcoin alongside legacy bitcoin and less than 50 % nodes signalling UASF by mid July, will UASF be officially cancelled?  Well there is no official entity that could decide that, so I guess it will still be run by some users.

Great, PM sent.  Out of curiosity, how long did it take and how many permutations did it try?
Electrum asks you for an account number when creating a wallet from a BIP39 recovery seed (normally 0).  You can try 1 to check if there is another account.

I wouldn't say every cloudmining is a scam.  There were some ponzi cloudmining schemes that didn't run miners but just payed old customers out with new investments, and there are outright scammers that sell you mining contracts and then run with the money.  But there are also honest cloudminers  - this doesn't mean that you will make a profit with them, though.
Mining is a competitive business.  Cloudmining providers take their cut for offering this service and that may be enough to not get your initial investment back. Also there is often a mining hype and then mining is not profitable for anyone (except the ASIC manufacturer).
I used a profitability calculator on some popular cloud mining offerings and usually it is only profitable if difficulty rises at most at 2 % every two weeks.  Look at the difficulty history and decide for yourself if this is the case.  This is not a scam of the cloudminers.  You can argue that they didn't warn you about the risks, but they never promised you a guaranteed profit. They just promised you the hashrate and they said which fee per month they take for electricity.  It's your responsibility to interpret these numbers correctly.

If you encrypt your Trezor with a long passphrase there is also only brute force to open the wallet.  But if you don't encrypt your raspi, it is trivial to remove the SD card and put it into an SD card reader, while it takes much more effort to read the flash of the Trezor.

The numbers are okay.  It considered over 188'550'000 permutations but only 11'783'972 had the right checksum.  It just skipped the others. 


That is strange, especially since Electrum accepts the seed.  Maybe a typo, or a space in the wrong place?

So far it happened twice.  Once in August 2010, when someone created 180 billion BTC by exploiting an overflow bug and once in March 2013 when an unintentional hard fork occured and was reorged eight hours later (at least from the perspective of updated clients).

If you have an unconfirmed rbf transaction and want to use the change output, you should instead combine the new transaction with the old one. RBF allows you to completely change the tx and add another output.
But yes, handling all the cases correctly, including when an old tx suddenly confirms can be a challenge.

Adding more fee levels would require changing the database layout again and is quite some work.  Also it is not possible to do it for the past. I already had distinction between fee level 0-5, 5-10,  though, so I added it again to the graph.
About one hundred 50kb transactions are at 2.3 - 2.6 sat/byte area, e.g., b420f7ada111420f0b240af8e7326f606d756cfbca42d1d44f63de62cca0bb0b
and about 150 100kb tx at 1 sat/byte, e.g.,
They are cleaning up their wallet by aggregating small inputs. Since they are reducing UTXOs it's actually good for nodes.  It's nothing new, it happened regularly over weekends when the backlog was still clearing out.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:19:23
The backlog is slowly diminishing, since a lot of mining power was recently added.  Fees are still high if you measure it in what we have seen in April, but currently below 140 sat/byte transactions are confirming again; they didn't confirm during the previous week.  On the weekend, low fee transactions in the sub 50 sat/byte region will probably be confirmed.  
But on Sunday evening the next difficulty update will come and that will negate the added mining power.  Expect new backlogs next week. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:03:20
14 % difficulty increase today since the miners produced blocks 14% faster than 10 minutes the last two weeks.  I'm expecting new backlogs next week!

Your interpretation is wrong. That huge orange bar at 0-30 is just the backlog from May that still haven't been confirmed.  The blue bars are the transactions from today that have been confirmed.
True, there have been a lot of transactions in the 0-30 region confirmed today (after waiting for just five weeks) but still the majority of transactions is in the 250+ sat/byte region.  You can pay less, but then you may wait for a few hours for confirmation.
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:58:03
There is a very small chance that it confirms in a few hours (mempool is almost at the 40 sat/byte boundary, but it usually grows at this time of the day).  It's likely that it will confirm over the weekend.

SSSS has a very simple security guarantee: If you have m-1 pieces and m are necessary to restore the secret, then every secret of the same length can be encoded by adding the right m-th piece.  So the secret can literally be anything.  But if you have, e.g., the first half of every piece, then it is possible that you could decode the first half of the secret, or not, depending on the details of the scheme.
I'm thinking about a SSSS scheme specifically designed for BIP-39 seeds.  You can make it such that each BIP-39 word corresponds to one word in each of the pieces.   Each piece would consists of 14-16 words, first word "shamir" indicates that it uses SSSS, the second word is the configuration (how many shares needed and the number of the piece it belongs to), then 12 words to encode the 12 word of a bip-39 secret and finally 0-2 words checksum/error correction code (so that you can check each piece independently of the other pieces).

Yes, I signed my first SegWit transaction in April 2016 (on segnet).  The BIPs came out Jan 2016 and the first public presentation was I think in Dec 2015, which still doesn't give you full 2 years :)  Okay I  will gift you the 4 months.
But you also stated that Jihan was fighting SegWit since 2015 because of AsicBoost, so lets look further. The earliest statement from Jihan about SegWit I could find is from May 2016:
Here he says that he will adhere to the agreement, but made it clear that the agreement stated that one requirement was that the hard fork is released.
Asicboost was also mentioned there but in a different context:  Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner's whitepaper came out in March 2016 and there was a discussion if the upcoming hard fork (the one that Jihan wanted) should also make AsicBoost impossible.

You may have heard of the segwit discount.  A segwit transaction is a bit cheaper than a regular transaction.  This is done by treating it as a smaller transaction than it really is.  In particular the witness part (the signature and public key) is counted only as 1/4 of the real size.  So instead of the real size of the transaction, one uses the virtual size of the transaction, measured in vbyte.   For a non-segwit transaction size and virtual size is the same, for a segwit transaction the virtual size is smaller than the real size.
The weight is just four times the virtual size and is used to avoid fractions.   It's used in consensus critical code, since using floating point which are prone to rounding errors must not be used there.  So 1 weight = 0.25 vbyte.  Some sites and programs give the fees in satoshi per kiloweight, e.g. blockchair and most lightning nodes.
Blocks are now limited to 4 million weight, or 1 million vbyte.  This can be done as soft fork, since old pre-segwit nodes don't see the witness part at all and thus see the blocks as being smaller than 1 MB.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:05:54
I can't speak for their motives and can only speculate.  At that time, Bitcoin Classic gained traction and that was programmed to hardfork to 2MB blocks if enough miners ran it.  The core developers wanted to avoid a split, especially given that the 1 MB blockchain would have a minority of miners behind it (by the definition of the activation mechanism).  Maybe they meant it honestly and wanted to make a hardfork that would gather most of the community behind it.  Maybe they just wanted to delay.
In the end, I guess most core developers weren't behind increasing the blocksize and therefore did not actively work on or push the 2 MB hardfork.  Johnson Lau did work on a hardfork (spoonnet), that also increased blocksize over a time of eight years, but that never got much traction.  Nobody, including the author pushed for it. Ironically part of it, the replay protection, went into BCH.  Luke's proposal that initially even decreases the block size felt more like a provocation.

The idea of fault attacks is to put the processor in conditions it was not designed to run.  This causes it to make random errors and if you can tweak it right, you can make it the kind of errors you'd like it to do, e.g., skip the checking of the PIN.
You can even send it some malicious code (which is of course not executed) and then cause a hardware fault that makes the processor execute the code (there are articles that suggest that this is possible).  I don't have the equipment to try things like this myself, and I'd like to see what they found and if they have ideas how to prevent this.

- 1 byte witness = 1 weight,
- 1 byte non-witness = 4 weight.
Some people see the witness of being "outside" of the transaction and I talked about being inside the witness part or outside the witness part, which may explain the confusion.

Earlier I used core to label what is now BTC.  At that time there were the UASF, Core, UAHF (aka bitcoin cash), and segwit2x and it wasn't clear how many forks would arise and which one would keep the bitcoin name.  Somehow that "core" still survived in the description.

It's somehow the other way round.  Lightning is fast, because the payment was already confirmed into a 2-of-2 multisig wallet when the channel was established.  So because the payment cannot be directly accessed by either party without the other party's permission (except for the pre-signed time-locked transactions), all they have to do is to exchange new pre-signed time-locked transactions and invalidate the old ones.
The details are a bit more complicated especially for multi-hop payments where multiple parties are involved.  But still if all parties agree, the payment is done as soon as all new signed transactions are exchanged.  However, if some party is evil and doesn't forward the payment, the payment will be in limbo for a day or so.
