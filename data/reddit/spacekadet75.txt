Initially I saw it when zooming in on browser so wacked it it into photoshop and played around with channels, etc took an hour till i got to the point you could see it better so cant remember the exact process.
Another point if you separate the RGB channels of the original picture and just look at the blue channel and zoom in most of the words have dots around them like this ( ive since changed it to black n white)
 
I know the puzzle can be solved by just the main print but this guy is clearly a designer so nothing to say he may have added extra clues in the digital copy?

Without having the print its hard for me to say but this is actually visible if you zoom in a bit and look hard enough its a slightly different colour to the black, It may be visable on the print? Anyway probably nothing but couldn't help wondering why its there

Welll Ive got what the puzzle is about and have the first set of words but it doesn't stop there, kindof got the next bit i think and maybe got the gist of the bit after that\(if not ive got the second bit wrong\). I hope that 7 under the cross doesn't mean there's 7 levels. Thought I had it cracked yesterday but going to take a lot longer i think. Awesome puzzle though.

There is an image behind the image, you can see it slightly if you zoom in enough.
Cant figure out if it means anything so thought id share it.
Found some other stuff too but not ready to share that just yet.
Heres the best I can do to  get it to show through.

Close to giving up,
I know what its about but there are far too many different ways to read it.  
ive found clues to 12 words in one "thing" some not bip words though but definitely pointed to in the picture so what to do with them?  
Ive also found references to 12 "things" again not bip words so where to go with them?  
Thought the clues given might help but in "code easily attack early" Ive found at least 10 different full sentences using all the letters, each would give a different direction/ way of solving and as for the longer clues I could write hundreds of different directions/orders.
Trying every way would take years.
I thought once i knew what it was on about things would become a bit clearer but it just gets more and more complicated. Cant find a clear direction anywhere.

There is only one wallet mentioned if there are other smaller prizes there are also other wallets involved somehow.
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:54:18
Yes Im aware of that,  but it doesn't mean that's going to be the information provided in the puzzle. For example it somehow could make up a QR code  that gives you the information needed, it could lead to a website that gives you the information needed.

 would explain it better than I can

No but part of it is somewhere in the US
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:36:57
Crypto Greetings said that there are some consolation prizes hidden in the picture. Yet we only have one wallet address?  Makes me think its something other than seed words. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:59:53
But I can see how you got Boston, might be another part of it.

 looking at the same thing now, if it is, I think I know where it is. Was going along one way of thinking from the clues given by the OP but it lead nowhere except linking to this place. There's lots of pointers to suggest its the right place but the map seems to be a bit scrambled as though the same place is in 2 different spots maybe need to pair things up somehow. Thought maybe the I's were large  bridges and the = were foot bridges although it doesn't fully work out right. I fear like all the other puzzles it will involve some form of coding that is beyond me always seem to get to the point with these where I can understand it but do not have the skills to solve it.  It could be that this is just another set of clues that leads onto somewhere else, I did think of something which oddly enough then links back to BTC there was a few obvious answers there but lacking any understanding of order I got stuck there so have come back to this. I just cant find much meaning in the numbers other than pointers to places yet think they must be important. Op said you can ignore at least half the words (or something like that) but never said anything about ignoring or disregarding the numbers.
