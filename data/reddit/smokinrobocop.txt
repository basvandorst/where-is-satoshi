Yes you can turn it off whenever you want, the next time it comes back online it will just resync whatever is missing. I don't see an issue with VM as it's still a logical machine. Just storage space and network connection is required as far as I understand.

Theoretically you could get 32 but probably would need 64 GB so that should work. I don't know much about raspberry-pi how it operates and what is required for bitcoinqt client but keep us posted about your work. Sounds interesting.

there's no conspiracy around this, they made it clear if you give money to those entities (such as Snowden or Wikileaks) you are something something

This question reminds me of Anreas Antonopoulos speach I attended in Toronto, he talked about the 5 stages of grief here's an article covering it. Let me know what you think

To help the community you can become a full node, my only knowledge of this is running the bitcoinqt original client. you will need a stable internet connection and about 30gb of drive space (size of the blockchain). it will take some time to sync everything but this helps the security of the network. think of it like seeding in bittorrents.

is this for real?

I think to overcome these ddos on information it should be easy enough to make a software that works peer to peer and gets the latest data just like bitcoinity.org/markets any thoughts?
