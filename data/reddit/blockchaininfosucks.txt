Smallest wallets? I lost FIVE HUNDRED dollars, and I waited for OVER a MONTH and I was deliberately ignored.
Even if someone lost 10 dollars and got NO response from the service provider for a week they have every right to complain.
What makes this worse is that they responded only when the issue was brought to Reddit.

Even if I had lost thousands of dollars I would still support Bitcoin and advocate its use to others. People lose money to PayPal too but they never consider that a flaw in the dollar itself, just the payment processors. In this case Blockchain.info is just like PayPal too.

So I should just accept the loss and be happy with being ignored for over a month?
@_date: 2013-10-12 03:28:24
It was not delayed. It was lost. A month of NO response to email, support tickets, or private messages that were read but ignored, means it was stolen, and it didn't show up until today after it got enough attention on Reddit.
If you had read the post you would see I had no problems with using an online wallet but their Shared Send service, which they charge money for.

If they can't trace their own paid service in cases like this, why should anyone use it? Even if they can track the chain internally it doesn't mean it would be at all easy for some third party to track it, and that's usually good enough.

I've updated the original post with the actual destination address. The issue has been resolved though and Blockchain.info just paid me back 7 BTC a while ago.

You can just use the bitcointip bot yourself, but don't worry about it.

This was Ben's response to my ticket on Zendesk:

The address beginning with 1Amtbf... was their automatically generated Shared Send mixer address, not the one I actually sent the money to. I've updated my original post.
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:58:52
I gave them the benefit of doubt for as long as reasonably possible, but once a month had passed without any response it was clear that it wasn't just a routine issue.
I was contacting them solely via private channels (email, support tickets, forum messages) and I didn't get publicly vocal until it became clear that they were reading my messages but choosing not to respond.
@_date: 2013-10-12 03:18:10
Should I? (This is a legit question).
They did respond only after I posted on Reddit and it got this much attention (thanks!). I feel I should leave this for others that may be having the same problem. 
I did create another post [here]( saying it was resolved.
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:10:14
1Amtbf... is their mixer address, not the actual receiving address. I've updated the original post. The issue has been resolved and Blockchain.info just paid me back 7 BTC a few minutes ago.

I tried my best not to resort to accusing them of stealing and gave them the benefit of doubt for as long as possible, but at the time of posting about this on Reddit it has been OVER a MONTH.
I often check the profiles of their representatives on bitcointalk and they were clearly choosing not to respond to me, because they were responding to others and there's no way they could not have seem my messages or emails.
Guess what? It's only when I complained on Reddit today did they finally solve the problem. I've updated the original post.

Sure, that sounds like a great idea. How do I go about doing that? :)
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:53:17
For a long time I wasn't sure if it was a mistake on my part, so I actually went through everything I could to see if I recognized that 1Amtbf... address anywhere from my communication with anyone. I didn't.
You guys (assuming zootreeves is a Blockchain.info representative) never even offered to work with me on this issue, and the only time I heard anything from you over this is when I posted on bitcointalk a week ago and now here on Reddit.
What do you mean about not using addresses more than once? I was not receiving money from anyone, I was just trying to pay someone and I checked the Shared Send option. Address reuse does not factor into this, does it?
If you cannot even verify if someone uses this service, then you should err on the side of caution and either keep logs or remove the service entirely rather than risk liabilities like this.
Edited grammar.

I love the Bitcoin community, no doubt about it.

I didn't resort to using the word "steal" until they had completely ignored me for a month. Money lost + not responding despite clearly seeing my messages to them (according to their bitcointalk profiles) is as good as stealing.
Not surprisingly the very first time I got any response from them was when I accused them of stealing. It's obvious they read everything but only care enough to respond when it gets them negative publicity.
It's a shame because I otherwise loved Blockchain.info and it had served me well for a year until I started using their paid services.

Since I just got 2 free Bitcoins courtesy of Blockchain.info [(related post)]( how do I donate some of it over Reddit?
EDIT: Never mind, I see the documentation for the bot.
