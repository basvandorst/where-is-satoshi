What's the transaction Id?
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:28:39
Oh Shit!! There's a btc form you're meant to fill for that. Ignore the assholes making fun of you.
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:55:55
Access to what exactly!
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:22:27
Lol, how exactly, you idiot.
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:06:33
Yeah, just check the address you deposited your Bitcoins into and if they're still there, then there's hope.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:57:44
Did you check the blockchain to see where the coins ended up?
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:54:43
Don't understand you clearly.
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:03:27
Just paste your bitcoin address in any explorer and you should be able to do that or you don't know the address where you stored them?
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:54:23
You could just download electrum and use it in the mean time 
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:10:22
Message me, I can help you with this.
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:18:56
The other address must belong to you. Did you backup your mycelium?
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:50:54
Did you make a backup of the wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:04:42
Did you link it up with your mobile?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:35:25
What's the transaction id or the address you sent the coins to?
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:46:21
How many word seed phrase? 12? 24?
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:44:12
OK try sending it on Mac and see if it works, it should work!!
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:22:01
Unfortunately it is possible and people have had this problem before. A quick search and you'd see but it was mostly linked to botched electrum downloads but OP said he verified the signature of the wallet, so that eliminates that.
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:55:00
It makes sense. Electrum on Linux probably used the 25th word as a passphrase. Glad it worked out.
@_date: 2018-11-14 04:35:05
You're trying to sign a transaction with the wrong key, hence why it shows that error. Did you by chance create it as a multisig wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-14 04:58:26
Where did you download electrum from? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:34:06
Wait you mean, you get another address different from the two given in electrum, but with same key??
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:11:48
OK. That's good then. I tried to recreate the exact same scenario and I got a valid key pair, even with the wrong seed word. Maybe there's something else you did and you've failed to mention?
@_date: 2018-11-14 04:48:08
Are you very sure, because only a multisig will have a private that doesn't match the public key. The second wallet you created with the seed, showing you the exact same private key is the right key match. The first isn't, that's why you get that error. The only possible explanation apart from segwit is possibly an electrum error and you could try using another wallet or use the iancoleman tool to manually located the address and key pair.
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:55:04
It depends on what you used to recover and what you used to create it.
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:55:29
Definitely a user error.
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:58:09

@_date: 2018-07-17 05:56:14
Lol, you're asking him like he doesn't know how to check the blockchain himself.
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:56:58
Hahaha, doubt he'd be able to do anything with just a root key.
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:01:01
Not supported in my region.
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:24:50
What was the initial transaction id or the address?
@_date: 2018-12-17 09:26:18
Try blockchain.com, maybe that's your wallet I'd and password.
