I hadn’t had it either until today. My guess is there is some network congestion related to today’s drama.

Tl;dr 
You need to transfer your coin from Coinbase to GDAX first (no fee) then transfer from GDAX to your Airbitz wallet (no fee). You will need to verify your identity with GDAX before you can do this. Coinbase &amp; GDAX are the same entity - GDAX pays for the transfer to your Airbitz wallet for you, while Coinbase will charge you for doing that.

Had the same problem earlier this morning. Just give it a little while and eventually the sync will complete. At least that’s what happened with mine.

Could you explain why you think it will continue to go down? I have this feeling you’re telling people to educate themselves without having educated yourself. Give us a couple of key points to back up your opinion, otherwise your comment is just FUD.
