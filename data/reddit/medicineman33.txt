That's so great. I distribute Phoenix Tears hash oil to people a lot and have seen some amazing miracles. People given a death sentence by oncologists who want to radiate and chemo them in the slim hope that something might be done. Three months of cannabis oil treatment and they are cancer free! I have seen this with my own eyes with several people and have heard wonderful stories from many others that I have supplied oil to. Cannabis cures Cancer! (maybe not in EVERY case, but certainly enough to make it the very first treatment to try).  Would love to see this stuff out there and will definitely donate to your cause!

So awesome to see bitcoin getting this kind of exposure. I am tired of seeing this argument: ""Gold's value can be overstated at times, but it has a use," he says. "Bitcoin is nothing like that.""
He clearly doesn't understand that bitcoin is programmable money and there is a hell of a lot of value in that!

bitcoin was on the front page of the wsj money section with the advice for people to invest 1%-2% of their holdings in it. If this is a bubble I'd expect prices to keep rising for quite a while and crash far above the $400 or so it was before the rise began last week.

It's not silly at all if you want to keep your bitcoins anonymous. Also this is a big advantage for the underground economy for sure!

I bought a card with egifter last week. It took hours and multiple emails for them to send me the confirmation link email (couldn't access the card I bought without it). Finally got on, got my card and it said invalid code. So I wrote back and their response two days later was to ask if there was still a problem. Yep there still was. Their response three days later was that sometimes that vendor sends bad codes we'll look into it."  That was two days ago...about five emails and a whole week since I sent bitcoin and I'm still waiting egifter.....

Meal replacements are hardly a new thing. Looking at their list of ingredients I'd say you're better off with "raw meal" (  or any of the other many health food store powdered meals that are primarily made of sprouted beans and grains with added superfoods. If you're going to eat food concentrates stay organic and "live". I do like the name though I have to say neither of the guys in the video look vibrantly healthy. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 06:15:39
good article though I think your average user will still glaze over phrases like this: "the structure and design of a hashing algorithm is designed entirely so that a small change in the input can change the resultant hash by approximately 50% (or more, as in the case of SHA-256, where flipping a single bit results in a 50.6% difference). Thus, Bitcoin mining is not a calculated process,"

A better messaging system. A ratings system that can't be gamed. A more streamlined order process to make it easier for beginners to use.  Automatically taking off trades when users are not logged in (available).  Plenty more but thats what I think of off the top of my head.

Modern cancer research is unfortunately a profit driven, big money industry. How they get people to donate given the astronomical rates of their treatments I don't know...they must have some kick ass marketers. They offer 3 and only 3 treatments: chemo, radiation and surgery. All of them extremely damaging to the body and contrary to what you might think with a very very low chance of success.  I went through a cancer journey with a friend and researched it thoroughly.  He eventually healed himself with phoenix tears (a type of strong cannabis oil) and an alkaline diet. If you really want to help people with cancer I'd suggest giving to the Seth group which explores alternative treatments in a scientific way. They accept bitcoin donation:

I read a research paper on this subject last week. Can't find the link but their conclusion was that blockchaininfo and bitcoinfog both were good and to avoid bitcoin laundry. Since blockchain info charges only .5% and bitcoinfog 1%-3% it makes blockchain the clear choice. Just be sure to not mix all your money at once as that lessens the effectiveness. One free way that many people use is to send their money to Silk Road and then back again.

The average user doesn't need to understand about mining and blockchains. They just need to understand that is like buying a foreign currency that can rise and lower against other currencies. And of course how to buy and sell them. I am seeing so many places accepting bitcoin now that people will long need to convert back to their nations currency before you know it.

Well the amount of bicoin users now are miniscule compared to the potential number of bitcoin users. If there is huge exposure in some european countries you could have hundreds of thousands of new users suddenly wanting in. How many countries are there and how many potential waves like this in each? A lot! It's easy to compare it to stock markets and commodities but this is really a whole new thing. If it's not shut down, I think bitcoin investors can expect many more metoric rises in the future. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 18:26:51
I'd be more clear about what the site is about. There's not even any mention of bitcoin on it or how it works.

It's very useful if you want to keep your bitcoin anonymous. Imagine a scenario where the 100 bitcoins your bought today suddenly become worth $50,000 each. If you live in the United States you will have to give probably over half of it the government for taxes. If you think that is ridiculous...well you just don't file. Whether you agree or disagree with this action, you can easily see the motivation. Not to mention if you want to buy bitcoins for drugs or you want to move money to another country without a paper trail. Cash to bitcoin is very useful.

It's clear from their amount of listings that they never really took off. The most likely explanation is that it is not financially viable for them to stay open. The honeypot theory doesn't make sense. They would not get much info from vendors, they don't take care much about users and the majority of vendors I am sure launder their coins.

When you consider the type of people that are involved with bitcoin now: intelligent freedom lovers, it is exciting to thing that these might be the new billionaires instead of the children of these fossils like the rockefellers, carnegies etc.   I would say be prepared that bitcoin might not be "the one", but even if it is not the one WILL come.
