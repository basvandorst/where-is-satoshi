Good to hear.
Even if it's not poison directly. I remember hearing something a few years about Chinese "fake eggs" made with industrial chemicals that could cause dementia. Ruthless people out there.

The time value of money is the central concept in finance theory.
If you're a large holding company that has a contract to build a new semiconductor fabrication facility in 2020 you can't just sit on your money until then, you need to think of ways to make profit to maintain your capital until that point.
On a more personal level, it may be nice to put money isn't a savings account for retirement knowing that it will maintain its worth. Whatever you don't use in your retirement would transfer to your kids as inherence. It's nice -- but if you're a new company that needs capital you probably won't have too many people taking a risk with you. They would much rather take a gamble on less risky (and possibly less innovative) companies if they don't have to worry about their money losing value anyway.
The problem we have now is that finance has turned into a game. People speculate and game the system -- but when you start thinking about "heavy industry" rather than head-funds you start to realize that finance world isn't all that bad.

Sorry -- perhaps "spend money" was a bit to general. I should have said discourage hording. If I want to save or grow my capital I have to give it to people who are going to make it grow. Otherwise I'll just let it sit around until something better comes along, and it may not.
Nothing is ever trivial! If I knew that my money would be halved in value each year I'd look for someone that can double my investment, or triple, quadruple, etc. In the end everyone's dollars are worth less than they were in December but I have more of them then the next guy -- and therefore I have more wealth. I don't understand what is so wrong with that.

Or those goods and services may not be sold at all.
Also, what if I write a book and I'm selling digital copies? You buying a copy doesn't mean that someone else can't.
I bought pizza with BTC for the novelty of it recently, but I knew that I would be losing out when/if the value increases. The only people I personally know spending large amounts of BTC are friends buying stuff on SilkRoad; things they cant buy with USD. Sadly a lot of people are just sitting on their coins, waiting until a day that may possibly never come.


Yes, so it's in your best interest to be competitive for that new money. That is was drives people to innovate and create new wealth. If you're not one of the people that receives the money directly then you need to create something of value to convince these people that they should give that money to you.
Have we come full circle to my original comment (below) yet?


@_date: 2013-08-14 23:29:36
Yes, I completely understand that. But since this discussion is about silkroad that's why I'm talking about silk road. See above where I acknowledge that the same thing can be done on ebay. 
Jesus -- again, I'm not trying to bash silkroad here. But I think people buying drugs online are more of a target for sick moralists looking to punish what are in their mind "bad people". What was my "argument" -- did I say we shouldn't use silkroad? I simply asked WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF.... 
@_date: 2013-05-31 08:48:05
What monopoly would that be? The stock market is pretty democratic as long as you have money.
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:43:38
Well I did get a good answer when someone mentioned that this would drive up the sale of test kits. Perhaps I was expecting a constructive discussion on how we could build even more trust into these networks. What I got was "SHUT UP YOU IDIOT THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN"
I thought the point of forums like this was to talk about what-ifs and such. Maybe the same kind of "dreamland discussions" are what lead people to think of health inspections, the FDA, etc. etc. etc.

You have a 401K instead of a stack of gold. The money in your 401K is invested in the economy. If you didn't need your 401K would that money be out in the economy or in a safe somewhere collecting dust?
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:56:05
I'm not scared of someone doing this -- and I don't mean to scare anyone, just asking a simple what if. I still buy Tylenol even after what happened a few years ago in Chicago.
@_date: 2013-05-31 09:40:55
Yeah, we kind of need the wisdom of the crowds on that one.
I think Austrian economics is like intelligent design because it's largely based on belief and tradition. Been there, done that, moved on to fiat money.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:02:12
Who would you take it from? If you destroy your stash then sure, your remaining coins will be worth more, but so will mine, and I didn't have to throw them into the abyss.
Interesting thought though. What if the IRS burned the notes we turned in every April.. hrmm
@_date: 2013-08-15 09:41:41
Well tons of comments later I think my question on what would happen actually created a fair amount of discussion. More irony for your foggy brain.
@_date: 2013-08-15 04:20:08
haha, that's what it looks like. Oh well, it was fun and I'm always one to take my downvotes like a man
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:04:56
I was luckily enough to go to a state engineering college with a low cost of living and studied a field (Electronics Engineering) that I figured would grow. 
The rise of automation, the increasing skills gap... lot's of problems we need to address.

If your income is rising along with the cost of a haircut you're paying the same relative price for that cut even though the dollar amount is different. You're not paying any more for that haircut!
Now if you don't have a source of income and don't have your capital invested then yes, that would be a problem. You can't just sit on your money (hoarding!) in that system.
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:11:27
I'm not trying to bash silk-road here. If someone is on ebay I guess they could be operating just as anonymously as they are on SR -- but most people aren't really buying food products or other direct consumables on eBay. If they are the issue is exactly the same as it would be on SL.
My point was that if someone (cough cough, get the tin-foil ready; maybe the CIA) decided to they want to scare SR users this might be a path they would take. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:09:01


I'm not talking about everyday purchases here. Yes, people will still buy food if we're in deflation. Likewise, buying food doesn't encourage growth.
You do realize that you can buy stock in companies, right? These companies will then use this money to generate more wealth. People should be encourage to give these companies capital rather than keeping the money in a lock box in their house.


If you know your money will be worth less today than tomorrow then you need to make a wise decision and consider the future. You will invest it in innovative companies if you want it to grow. If I know my money will be worth the exact same amount then I'm not going to worry about the future.
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:58:32
I'm stupid because I'm willing to acknowledge that sadists exist?
I'm being downvoted because what I'm saying doesn't fit into the narrow world-view of people who only wish to look at the good side of things without consideration for how to protect yourself from the mentally unstable.
The irony behind your comment and username is delicious. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:06:14
It comes with the territory my friend -- I can definitely see how people might get pissed at me for fear mongering, even though that wasn't my goal.
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:06:42
I'm not going to hold my breath or bet money on it either. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 09:30:01
 
Not specific to drug users -- but it's an example of people doing sadistic shit like I mentioned.
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:04:42
Even if there is a crackdown by the government I feel like a lot of people will start moving to Atlantis and other markets soon, the more diversity the better.
Also, what do you think will happen when someone decides to sell dope laced in PCP? Or perhaps cocaine with some sort of poison? I have my doubts due to the feedback and seller license process -- but it just takes one sick sad person. (
I know there has been some discussion about people selling poisons for assisted suicide and whether or not that should be allowed, but that's a whole different can of worms. Regardless, it may become a similar battle cry for the government as child pornography for cracking down on everything from software piracy to encryption.
I really enjoyed the guys -- I guess that's what I should expect with a mostly libertarian crowd anything not fitting into a very small "common sense" viewpoint must be eliminated. Loving the vengeful downvotes here : )
Can we get this post to -100? Come on, you guys can do it! Just keep clicking!

It's an accelerator. If we went with a deflationary system we'd still drive cars and dig for oil -- and people like Elon Musk would never get the capital he's invested into Tesla, SpaceX, or SolarCity.
The environment would be better off if we would have stayed in the feudal days, toiling as peons for kings and queens. But we wanted more, and now we have the internet and space travel. If we really want to make it as civilization we need to get off this rock, and I don't see how thinking about whether something is a sound investment or not will help.

Don't watch many of those. Guess I've been spending too much time in @_date: 2013-05-31 14:54:50
Derp on my part -- I did mean more today than tomorrow


People have a bias towards the status quo. The fear of inflation is a lot like the fear of winter in nature -- makes you prepare.
Give me some examples of deflationary economies that also had growth and innovation please. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:01:35
Thanks! That's actually the kind of response I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:49:47


I'm currently a research assistant and graduate student and recently got an offer from a large company that's expanding. Overall the technology sector is doing pretty well right now.


I'm not sure how you would hoard a haircut. What I said was that you need to be employed in a growing sector or you need to invest your money. Investing in this case would be the antithesis of hoarding. 
Again, try to think less day-to-day and more macro.
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:11:08


Well, we've wasted lots of electricity mining a currency that isn't being used. Also, if no one were actually spending BTC wouldn't it be worthless? It's not based on anything physical so we need the buying of items or another currency to determine the price.


So inflation is taking people's wealth slowly but it has nothing to do with taking wealth from people? What?


There is only so much you can consume. If inflation went up to 20% I'd be looking for companies that can give me a 21% return on investment. I would not be buying crap I don't need.
Let me know when people start buying Lamborgini's as their retirement fund -- because right now (in our inflation based economy) most people have it tied up in the market.
@_date: 2013-05-30 21:21:05
Without inflation how do you encourage people to spend money? Inflation drives innovation and growth.
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:03:42
Here's the problem: when you just drop money out of planes there is no way to make sure that it makes it into the hands of innovators. People just buying "stuff" will never drive growth! Growth happens because people with the money want to give it to the innovators for a good return on investment.
IMHO Austrian economics is to economics what intelligent design is to evolution.
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:01:32
Yes, I understand that. My point isn't that someone would do this day in day out. My point was that someone could do this to scare the users of silk-road. I did acknowledge feedback and vendor fees in my original post, but that's being conveniently ignored.
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:27:03
Some people just want to watch the world burn. Some people hate drugs and want to watch people suffer. Some people think they're cutting their drugs with someone relatively harmless when it turns out to cause a dangerous side effect.
The reason I brought this up is because establishing trust in networks like this is very important.
@_date: 2013-05-31 08:47:15
I think you missed the spirit of the statement by taking it too literally...
Modern economics accepts that on the macro-scale the logic of the invisible hand tends to break down. Many of our decisions have consequences that we didn't expect and need to correct for. I've heard lots of compelling arguments for Austrian Economics, but most of those arguments involve small day-to-day transactions; haircuts, food, etc.
Could the growth we saw in China over the last few decades have happened in a world running on "sound money" or did we need fiat currency to achieve that growth through investment?
What about the technology boom? By the end of the 1990's we had some amazing technology compared to 1980, but we also had a huge bubble in the early 2000's. We made it for a little while before we saw another boom and bust in the housing market. Sounds like a drag right? Well even after all of that, the NASDAQ today is higher than it was in 1999. When you look at the price of gold over time it has gone up as well, but when you look at the price of gold without inflation the rise isn't nearly as dramatic (
If you had the choice to buy X amount of gold in 1971 or X amount of a balanced index fund, and you had the ability to look up the market value of both in 2013, which one would you have picked?
@_date: 2013-05-31 10:25:21
Where are the case studies? Where are the modern economies running on Austrian principles? The basic assumptions would be the beliefs and historical use of precious metals would be the tradition.
@_date: 2013-05-31 10:12:31


Please explain. Why does it matter if I'm the one holding the money? If I give one 1BTC to someone else we still end up with 1BTC in the economy.


Again, what? If I bought a machine for 1 unit and the next year we all agree that we all need to pay 2 units for the same machine I would have lost money had I not bought that machine. (machine, stock, etc. insert whatever abstraction you want)


The people that picked the most 'valuable' machines to purchase will get a larger portion of the increased money supply when they sell back the machine.
@_date: 2013-05-31 11:00:56


I understand how deflation works, but how is there more for others to use? There is less in circulation, but the total sum of money is the same. If I hold money in a deflation based economy it helps me, but I don't see how it helps anyone else.


We increase the money supply to cause inflation and a specific group of people make the decision (albeit not so arbitrarily) on how much this inflation should be. I guess I can't assume people will read between the lines when I say things like "we all agree." 


Yes. As I said, "the next year we all agree that we all need to pay 2 units." We come to this agreement because we consider the worth of the machine as well as the increase in the money supply.

Is it possible to resell a vendor license? I doubt someone with a good rep would be willing to sell their license, or that someone would play an huge sum of money to buy this license and use it to sell bunk.. but hey, everything is possible I guess. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 09:48:11


You're right on that, it's about producing goods that add value (computers, new medicines, etc.) and grow the economy.
So if we just go back to the gold standard we'll stop satisfying personal needs like owning pets or buying make-up and start giving that money to NASA directly?
The way it stands now I can invest my money with innovative companies like SpaceX that will grow, leaving me with money left over to buy some lipstick for my pet pig. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:36:57


Again, this would be someone that gets their kicks off of inflicting pain on people. Something like this would probably make the nightly news, maybe making the investment worthwhile for our imaginary sicko.
I'm expecting more downvotes for the hypothetical.
