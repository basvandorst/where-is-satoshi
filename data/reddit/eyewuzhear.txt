FULL TEXT:  
"After two decades online, I'm perplexed. It's not that I haven't had a gas of a good time on the Internet. I've met great people and even caught a hacker or two. But today, I'm uneasy about this most trendy and oversold community. Visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic.
Baloney. Do our computer pundits lack all common sense? The truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.
Consider today's online world. The Usenet, a worldwide bulletin board, allows anyone to post messages across the nation. Your word gets out, leapfrogging editors and publishers. Every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly. The result? Every voice is heard. The cacophany more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harrasment, and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen. How about electronic publishing? Try reading a book on disc. At best, it's an unpleasant chore: the myopic glow of a clunky computer replaces the friendly pages of a book. And you can't tote that laptop to the beach. Yet Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Intenet. Uh, sure. 
What the Internet hucksters won't tell you is tht the Internet is one big ocean of unedited data, without any pretense of completeness. Lacking editors, reviewers or critics, the Internet has become a wasteland of unfiltered data. You don't know what to ignore and what's worth reading. Logged onto the World Wide Web, I hunt for the date of the Battle of Trafalgar. Hundreds of files show up, and it takes 15 minutes to unravel them—one's a biography written by an eighth grader, the second is a computer game that doesn't work and the third is an image of a London monument. None answers my question, and my search is periodically interrupted by messages like, "Too many connections, try again later."
Won't the Internet be useful in governing? Internet addicts clamor for government reports. But when Andy Spano ran for county executive in Westchester County, N.Y., he put every press release and position paper onto a bulletin board. In that affluent county, with plenty of computer companies, how many voters logged in? Fewer than 30. Not a good omen.
Point and click:
Then there are those pushing computers into schools. We're told that multimedia will make schoolwork easy and fun. Students will happily learn from animated characters while taught by expertly tailored software.Who needs teachers when you've got computer-aided education? Bah. These expensive toys are difficult to use in classrooms and require extensive teacher training. Sure, kids love videogames—but think of your own experience: can you recall even one educational filmstrip of decades past? I'll bet you remember the two or three great teachers who made a difference in your life.
Then there's cyberbusiness. We're promised instant catalog shopping—just point and click for great deals. We'll order airline tickets over the network, make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become obselete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the Internet—which there isn't—the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople.
What's missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who'd prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and where—in the holy names of Education and Progress—important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued."

Good to see XCP get a bit of a bump up in value recently as it has been well undervalued for quite some time.  A settlement layer for tokens built on top of bitcoin sure seems like a value proposition to me.

No judgement, just a reminder to myself and others that your account was created 7 hours ago, and your only comments in this sub are "Kraken works fine" and "Kraken is not as bad as polo."

Yes! 2FA is incredibly important.  Plus, you get to feel like a super spy entering the secret code, before it is destroyed forever.

Sounds like they are going to use the source code from protip not necessarily protip itself.  But if they have the source code implemented I imagine implementing bitcoin would not be too difficult.

Not working for me.  What's going on here?  I thought Kraken was "THE BEST BITCOIN EXCHANGE"


Now that I look at it, they mention nothing about withdrawals.  I expected something like " Deposits and withdrawal processed with immediacy, and accuracy."  Guess there is no guarantee of withdrawal.  
EDIT: After about an hour of refreshing.  Kraken finally let me execute my withdrawal.

I didn't know they offered a paid service to provide you with bitcoin price entrance and exit points.  The respect I had for them as a news service is quite diminished by this discovery.  Clearly they were just trying to make money, not actually report the news.  Weren't they involved in the "pay for play" articles scandals of the past couple years?  (Also I'm pretty sure this is an article from today and not old.  1/10/2015 in American would be 10/1/2015)

Some sort of issue with the data provider is causing this.  GOOG also down 87% to 123.47

With the network hashrates the way they are nowadays, you would need some pretty decent mining rigs.  Power costs and equipment costs would trump any potential profit you would make.  .1btc a week is a bitcoin every 10 weeks.  Mining is now in the hands of the big players, home mining has come and gone.

I know it's a Bitcoin exchange that's exactly why any kind of withdrawal problem sets off red flags.  Oh and welcome to Reddit brand new user.

Seems like this guy is mad that Purse suspended his account after he used (likely) stolen gift cards bought at a massive discount, to buy bitcoin.  If it seems too good to be true it probably is.  Simple enough, don't use stolen gift cards to buy shit on Purse.
EDIT:  Just read below that this guy bought Amazon gift cards for 75% off.  Umm yeah, big red flag.

Cheers!  Brewer here as well.  I looked at their website and it seems like it's more fittings and valves.  I wanted them to have awesome conical fermenters and brites too. But it doesn't appear that way.  Damn. You might be able to build a pretty cool electric system on a homebrew scale from what they have though.

Can confirm: Has always been a tool.  Since his days as "[D-splooge](  
Bonus Facts: He raised money for a political campaign and never actually filed his papers.  He also raised money for a morning show, which never really panned out, but somehow he had enough money to move to Los Angeles, right around this same time...
