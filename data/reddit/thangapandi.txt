Hi Smith,
I was already filed a complaint there.  I just got message from them, they are analyzing the report and will reply you.   So am waiting for acorn.gov.au response.  Once they replied,  I will update you.
Also how they know, the case was filed against them?
Please advise.

Dear All,
Am also victim of igot.com, i have account with igot.com,  As usually i am doing bitcoin trade with igot.com, I was deposited my bitcoins and sold it.  Once sold, i will make withdrawal request to my bank accounts.  All previous withdrawal was processed with some delay.  Even i was continue the business with them.
Last July 2015, i was requested withdrawals as like below details,
    2015-07-03 - 31,550.00 INR
This above withdrawal was requested 10 days ago and also next one requested 5 days ago.
    2015-07-09 - 93,300.00 INR
Those above two withdrawal was not processed and not yet recieved my money.  I was sent multiple emails to them.  Still now they are not responding properly.
 I was contact them through their support ticket and they confirmed me will send my money within August 5th to 10th. But till now they are not responding through the ticket system, so i searched through internet and i found they stopped most of the peoples payment. I really shocked and found their company details and owner info. So i was contact that site support person Daniel Palmer and Rick Day through their email id such as hello dan and rick Rick was contact with me from last week through mail, But he told me, "our site records shows, payment was cleared", So i sent my bank account transaction history to him. After that he was told me will contact my bank and then will update you. I hope he is trying to scam me.
So i was written mail to him and also their support team, am going to file a case against this and also they are not responding properly. Please check ticket image and also transactions history. If you want i can send you our bank account history. I need my money, Let me know what are all evidences i need to submit?
i can see so many allegations about igot.com right now,  So please help me to recieve my money from them.  I have taken all screenshots of my transactions from igot.com and also support ticket conversation.
Please advise
