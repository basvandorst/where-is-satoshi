Gold is worth something and those investing aren't using it either. HODLing is using BTC as it reduces supply and raises the floor of the bottom price. You should thank them.

Over 9k by midnight is my guess. 11.4 million Americans will be watching Bitcoin on 60 minutes tonight. Hopefully educate and create some fomo

I felt that earlier in the year and what helped me was to shift my focus from worrying about my investment to investing in things I can control - myself. Exercise, learning new skills and/or pursing additional degrees. Through this I was lucky enough to land a better paying job and feel better financially. I am still bullish on crypto and continue to DCA but don’t let the worry, stress and depression distract you from other pursuits that you may have in life (or from family/friends). My experience might not be helpful for everyone but thought I’d post as it might help someone. I hope the best for you guys and market in the future.

Touche sir, I could see how that can be interpreted from what I said. I don't truly believe I'm going to lose it all or else I wouldn't have bought into it. I may have subconsciously worded it that way to mentally prepare myself for the road ahead.

The past doesn't always predict the future but the past can show what is possible (20k). Right now it's 3.5k...if you believe in the past trends I would say it's a good time to buy (purely my opinion).

I have been considering this approach. I wanted to get  decent skin in the game now, and implement smaller but more consistent buys thereafter. Have you been doing this?

I'm in the market for one, any suggestions?
