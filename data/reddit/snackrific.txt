Should have had a government guy walk up, rip the dollar in half, and watch it grow into two dollars.

I'd be interested in what country you're from.

If you even considered selling at 18k, you're going to regret it.  This is only the beginning.

The problem is, it could go to 100k then 'correct' to 30k.

Eh not necessarily.  Once we have our first price correction after this spike we'll see where the price ACTUALLY is.  Perhaps that won't come, but bitcoin has followed a certain trend...

The entire point of them is that they're made so basic that they have the BARE MINIMUM to do what they do, and aren't hackable for this reason.  The best someone can do is insert a chip inside of your hardware wallet in order to steal any bitcoin added.  You should be able to check inside to double check that they have the standard 'innards' and aren't tampered with.

There are more than 21 millionnaires in the world.  Yet there are only 21 million bitcoin.  Therefore, if all FIAT was converted to crypto, not every millionair could convert their fiat to a single bitcoin, providing a good basis that if it becomes adopted that a single bitcoin could be worth more than a million dollars today.

Kraken is notoriously bad and even their own CEO advises not to use them for the time being while they sort out their issues.

Baby boomers take country with best job prospects in the world and give it some of the worst job prospects while also managing to rack up a 20Trillion dollar national debt and completely corrupt our political system.
"Cynara suckers!"

Why on earth would you be spending right now? That's like using Amazon shares for coffee back in 2010...  That better taste like 3,000 coffee.
