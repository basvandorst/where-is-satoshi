He means worthless gold bars filled with pressed latinum. Sometimes they use fake gold which doesn't store the latinum as well. It is very difficult to identify for most in the Ferengi Alliance.

Thank you! I understand now.
I didn't realize the entire blockchain history had to be stored! That's why it's such a massive download to start running a node. The larger sizes would definitely be worse in the long run compared to waiting for off chain solutions like lightning.
Thanks again. I really appreciate it!

I have no idea what's going to happen the next week.
But I believe once BCH price is stable, it'll plummet as people dump it for BTC, then BTC will jump above $20,000 before Christmas.

Because it's 10 years away, plenty of time to replace every currency on the fucking *planet*.

Something that struck me earlier this year was when someone commented on a post about BTC hitting an ATH of $4,000. They said we'd all soon be begging for $4,000 BTC.
I thought that would be nice... That is, for it to go up that much that we would do that.
Well, we'll all soon be begging for BTC as cheap as $16,000 very soon. I'm positive of that fact.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:08:39
Anybody concerned about XRP/Ripple?
It's gained 800% this month. Almost 100% just today, It's now the number 2 crypto and at half the daily trading volume of BTC today and rising. 
Whenever BTC increased 500%+ in a month it was a bubble that burst soon after. I'm thinking this is the case with ripple too, but not sure. 
Just worried a bit, ripple is basically the opposite of BTC. Centralized and 20% all owned by the company that made it. So on principal I don't want to support it, but it's going up like crazy, while BTC is stagnating.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:06:17
DUDE. don't advertise that you have 21 BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:55:46
So it'll collapse back to $8000? We haven't seen that in a month!

So I should sell at 20 and then rebuy the dip? Got it! s/
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:26:26
That's what I'm thinking. It's gone basically vertical on the year chart when looking at the growth this month. 
EVERY time Bitcoin did this much growth this fast it collapsed afterwards. I believe that'll happen with XRP once BTC starts rising again in January, but it's getting uncomfortably close in market cap to BTC IMO. So I'm just sitting here concerned it'll cause Bitcoin to plummet if Bitcoin falls to number 2 in market cap.

Aren't the bitcoins supposed to be divided evenly among the miners? How did one person get all of them lost?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:51
My thoughts exactly, how exactly is Bitcoin core any different since all the mining is done by huge operations.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:42:45
Personally I'd wait because it usually crashes/dips a little after a spike like this. Last week it rose 10% and then crashed 20% before rising again to now be 20% HIGHER than the last spike was before the dip.
But then again I might be wrong and it could go up more and then stabilize without a significant dip. Who really knows. But the overall trend is constantly going up, so it's always a good time to buy really.

Next month it's $100,000!
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:42:02
If the Bitcoin price goes up, does the difficulty rise to match it? Say for instance, I mine 0.01 BTC a day with Bitcoin being $20,000 if BTC doubles in value next month to $40,000 would I still be mining 0.01 or would it drop to 0.005 BTC a day?

They said they would add it by Jan. So it's early
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:59:19
But then wouldn't that 0.8 BTC I mined be worth more than the 0.25btc had I hodled?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:30:54
Exactly, even if all BTC but one was lost, that 1 BTC could then be changed to be divided to 1,000,000,000,000,000 pieces, which is 10,000,000 more than now. Effectively increasing the amount of BTC by 10,000,000.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:18:08

Good on you for accepting both BTC and BCH, honestly I own no BCH and 90% BTC, but I would accept both too if I were you. I find it funny that you've posted on both subs and both have discussions on why you shouldn't include the other's preferred coin as an option. Haha.

I'm in for financial freedom and security. Sure it's fun to joke about getting rich, but that's not the main thing to me.
If I hypothetically had a $1,000,000 today and I stuck it in a savings account, I'd lose money every year because of inflation of fiat, when I go to retire in a few decades it'll be worth significantly less than it was when deposited.
But if I put it in Bitcoin, the likelihood is I would not only have the same value, it would always grow. And there's monthly no account fees, nobody in charge of my money but me.
In the future when Bitcoin becomes mainstream, if I go to a garage sale, I can send someone Bitcoin on the spot when purchasing something, I can send someone money anywhere in the world. On vacation no foreign transaction fees because everyone uses the same thing.
It's truly revolutionary. But that doesn't mean I can't get excited when Bitcoin doubles every 6 - 12 weeks right now.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:53:03
Only if I purchase on coinbase does it lock in the price. I transferred to GDAX. Which means I have $150 USD in my account to buy with once it clears

Hey, Bitcoin is volatile. Don't think about the losses, because they're always followed by rises eventually. I first learned of Bitcoin in 2012, and was offered one for $10, instead I bought a silver dime...
Then I bought one during the last bubble when it got to $900, then it dropped to $200 over the next 2 years and it felt pretty shitty, but I didn't sell, and even bought a couple more when it went to $450, and look at it now. ☺️

It used to be $0.01 each, when it was $0.10 was it too late to buy? What about $1? $10? $100? $1000? 
I do not think it's going to be too late for a while. We'll see Bitcoin go up 1000% several times more I think. But nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:17:05
Nobody knew. Don't beat yourself up over it.
I feel bad I didn't look into it when I was introduced to it at $10 per coin in 2012.
Nothing can be done wishing we did things differently.

It's what I'm doing
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:15:28
So should I keep my Bitcoin in my trezor or coinbase if I want to sell the B2X right after the fork?
Is it wise to sell after the fork?
I still am not sure which will be the leading fork but coinbase deciding segwit will be BTC is pretty damning to segwit2x probably preventing it from becoming the leading chain.
I want as much of the leading chain as possible. And selling B2X for more BTC sounds like a good idea.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:17:26

Bravo Good sir.
You've just motivated me to buy 0.02 BTCs!
$18 well spent I'll say.
And if it hits $1,000,000 a BTC in 3 years, then I'll have $20,000! One can dream!
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:39:00
Huh, so I was able to send it to my PC's wallet, and it is showing my balance is now ฿0 and ฿0.00026789 was sent to my PC.
When I said to withdraw and send all ฿0.00038789?
Is there a ฿0.00012 fee per transaction? I thought BTC didn't have any fees?
Thanks again!

She wouldn't want me to. I know her well enough to not even ask.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:22:49
Haha. Maybe I feel like it is. $10 a BTC a year ago, now it's $1000 a BTC.
Plus, I was raised with parents who ALWAYS tried those stupid "programs" and wasted so much time and money.
If this pays 10x (or more) my initial investment it'll be the first venture that actually pays us anything.
So maybe I'm unfairly bundling BTC with what I was exposed to growing up, and it's coming through in my tone.
Sorry about that. :-\
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:04:01
Thanks, I was actually already looking at that. haha. I have a wallet now, with 0 BTC lol. Would it be a good idea to buy, IDK, $20 worth of BTC through 24change? If it really does hit $1,000,000 per BTC in 3 years (or who knows, maybe $1,000,000,000 per BTC in 6 years!) that $20 would be worth $20,000.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:12:32
So it's a gamble. And, just like stocks, it will go up or down, though chances are it is more likely to go up I'm assuming?
I have a feeling this is a bubble that will pop, and go down to $300 a BTC, and than rise steadily again.
But, there's no guarantee.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:02:46
Ha. She wouldn't appreciate a violation of her privacy like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:56:30
Yeah, I realize I shouldn't go nuts over the possibility of that much money. But at the very least, $10,000 per BTC wouldn't be bad considering I invested $900 to get it.
$1,000,000 per BTC might be a pipe dream right now, but nobody knows what the future will hold. :-)
Fingers crossed.
