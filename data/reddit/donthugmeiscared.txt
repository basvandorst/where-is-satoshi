Wow ok that took far longer than I was expecting (and the fees were a little higher too lol) but honestly it was worth it for everything I've learned. I really hope it works this time hahaha

On lightning... You mentioned I didn't need to open a channel? Very nifty indeed.

Ok some (hopefully) final issues I'm running into...
After depositing $51.48 USD in bitcoin to lightning app, it charged me $2.13 in fees to bring it to the lightning network channel. That seems absolutely ridiculous for something that is supposed to mitigate fees and I'm still kinda mad about that.
This $49.35 is now the capacity of the channel, but I can only use $46.69? When can I get my other $2.66? 
When making a payment request on the lightning wallet on Bluewallet, no matter how much it is for, I am always getting either a: "lightning payment failed" or "fee estimation failed" error on the lightning app when trying to send it through. How can I resolve this?

Ok pardon my confusion here, my balance of bitcoins is currently in the lightning app... I open up and fund a channel, then send that whole balance of the channel to blue wallet. Whatever the amount I sent would be the maximum I could receive, correct? And does it have to be blue wallet because it supports a "lightning wallet" (lots of new terms for me) or can it be any wallet?
