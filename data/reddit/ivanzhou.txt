I never doubted Dave from the very beginning coz the wallet would be lost EVEN IF Dave was a scammer.  At least giving him 20% of the recovered wallet you'd have a better chance of getting back the remaining 80%.

Celery offers great services.  I have used them enough in the past year or so now I can buy and sell 20k worth of BTC instantly.  At the beginning, their UI was a bit rough and buggy but they have since made great strides to become where they are today.  Too bad they are still relatively small next to Circle and Coinbase, which stinks to high heaven in my experience.

People who have asked the same question when bitcoin was $10, 100, 500 and now $800 are either kicking themselves for not buying in sooner or buying in at $1200.  The safest speculation is not invest at all or with the most minimual amount you can afford to lose.

Folks, why don't you consider the possibility of Purse raising the fee high enough to either deter people from asking too high a discount (thus becoming target of a scammer), or Purse using the higher fees at steep discounts to self-insure against frauds.  Based on recent 15 or so orders, I can attest that Purse is a trustworthy company themselves.

There's legitimacy to their business model because of said referral below on regular purchases and people acquiring bitcoin via CC purchases of wishlists.

It's going in the right direction for sure.  Let's shoot for 800 million or 1 billion this year.  Once the roads are built, people will come.

I have had at least half a dozen canceled orders with Coinbase amongst many successful orders.  After the last canceled order, I switched to gocelery and later circle.  So far so good with those two.  Gocelery gradually raise your weekly buy limit. I have done over $30,000 with them and about $7,500 with circle.

You need nerves of steel to survive drops like that.  That was a 98% value depreciation.

Is it an easy process in your experience?  I live in the US.  I really like the way bitstamp structures their transaction fees as opposed to a flat rate.

I actually have more.slush fiat to convert to bitcoin.  Sounds like bitstamp is being recommended here?

There's no need to convince anyone.  Their fate will determine if and when they will come onboard.

Humans have only had 50 years or so dealing with information security.  Cut them some slack please.

Set up a raspberry pi node for $80 and you are supporting the bitcoin ecosystem.  The cost of electricity for that full node is next to zero.

Most so called millionaires don't that much LIQUID assets and are inclined to invest in things they can understand.  The grass root approach is a far more feasible and likely scenario, if you really want bitcoin to become a household term.

Let's worry about clearing 500 first.

That stolen $ is most likely replenished with a push of the printing press button which actually adds to the "infinite" supply of fiat currency. On the other hand, stolen bitcoins neither add to nor subtract from the fixed issuance of predictable supply 21million.  Two fundamentally different events from a monetary perspective if you ask me.

Wish I had but no, the God of Luck didn't know me then.

How much are you buying?  $2500 each time with Circle satifies my buying itch.  If thats not enough, Gocelery.com is there for me.

I have transferred all btc to an Android wallet (btc.com wallet) that supports Bitcoin Cash once the fork happens tomorrow.  Wonder if anyone is doing the same to earn some "potential" free cash (no pun intended, lol)?

It's a process....Rome wasn't built in one day.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:11:51
I had no idea btc.com was not reliable.  So just move it to a paper wallet and leave it there till the fork happens, right?

The fact that humans continue to dig up gold from the ground and hace been doing so for the last thousands of years suggests that while scarce, gold is probably not as rare as it seems.

Implementing multi-sig to the front-end user accounts and to hot wallet is just as critical as to offline cold wallets, where a theft of this magnitude could easily wipe out smaller exchanges and to horrible PR to the bitoin name.

Western Union wasn't dummy proof on day one so can't expect a months old bitcoin based transmitter to be fool poof either.

The OP jumps thru hoops to MAKE us stupid bitcoiners understand that a bitcoin will never be worth a million dollars.
