If either of those claims had a leg to stand on then the Republican House would've taken legal action. You'd think after so many attempts to repeal the ACA that they'd take it to the Supreme Court if it was simply unconstitutional. The travel ban could've (and was amended on the third go to be) constitutional, but it was just shoddily assembled the first couple of times.

Except the original travel ban's issue wasn't its preclusion of ethnicity, but the preference for Christianity. Permanant U.S. residents were denied reentry which was a violation of their constitutional rights. The federal government does not retain the power to deny even non-citizens entry if its pretenses stand in opposition to the constitution; this was realized in the ban's preference for Christians over Muslims despite either given individual legally visiting and/or staying. Besides, the ban's chief citation for existing in the first place (9/11) was flimsy at best when considering the statistics of terrorists originating from countries that were banned and those that were not *cough* Saudi Arabia *cough*

Pretty sure we just saw what he said realized with our current administration twice. Sure, there's corruption, but life isn't a zero-sum game.

With the striking down of the travel bans. They were executive orders but became unenforcable when they were deemed unconstitutional by federal judges.
