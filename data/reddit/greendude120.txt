Im not a pro when it comes to crypto theorycrafting but I wonder if Christmas bills coming in at end of January caused a lot of people to withdraw to pay off their CCs.

You buy presents in December and put them on your credit card and then in january you gotta pay it off partially or entirely. I dont know just a theory. i know money is tight after holidays so pulling out crypto profits might have been too tempting.

How can I redeem my BCC without using that app? Like if I grabbed any other app or exchange and wanted to redeem my BCC there?

So I have my Electrum wallet with BTC. After august 1st, how can I redeem my BCC (without using this sketchy electron cash software)?

Why are we trusting electron cash at all? If they arent trustworthy to handle your BTC why would you trust them with BCC if that becomes the next bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:37:14
And you trust it even for that purpose?

fuck fuck fuck. i was recommended electrum 2 days ago so i got it and decided to wait for all this to blow over. Now i see this post? What do I do? What wallet can i get. I cant run my own node the HDD is full!
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:14:07
Unfortunately I dont have room for a node.
Once another trustworthy desktop wallet (remote node) comes out for BCC, what do I do to redeem my BCC there?
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:03:34
yea sorry I get it now. Im a newbie so I was scared and confused. What i dont understand is how that electrum.org post says that Electron Cash is unsafe and then after it tells you how to get your BCC using Electron Cash? how will I be able to redeem my BCC without using this sketchy fork/software?

I thought the recovery seed of electrum is purely to recover electrum wallet. Is that not the case?
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:56:22
I do care though. I have my BTC local on my desktop using Electrum software. And when BCC comes out, i want to redeem my BCC too in case thats the one that takes off. What should I do? Download another wallet software and dedicate it to BCC? And how do I even redeem BCC
