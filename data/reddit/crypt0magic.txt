This is why I have serious doubts about crypto.
How can it even function as currency if you have to take a cap gains tax hit with every transaction - and keep the records?

"Avoid taxes" will bring less support and information then "reduce tax liability". Ones illegal, other is smart.

Sorry- Hope you get your money.

Why is CNBC so obsessed with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:41:30
Devils advocate - if someone has been posting  here for years and hits their personal moon, then a goodbye and good luck post makes sense.

Well I bought the max I could on a card, a lot from savings, and dropped my 401k loan on it. When Bitcoin was 6k....which was all really really dumb. Really really really dumb. Super dumb.
Now I just gotta handle the taxman tho. It could have gone pretty bad. Just a lucky idiot I guess.

In USA you need to document the gift and its cost basis. The cost used for cap gains is what you purchased it at. Otherwise 0 will be assumed.
If gifting several bitcoins, you will be look at gift tax.
I would file any Bitcoin gifts even if under min taxable amount, save some grief if it goes up latter and hey come after you for gift tax.
Also the recipient must have clear and unrestricted access to the Bitcoin.
And get a pro

Wow, the scary internet hacker guy must be between gigs between commercials.

Valid strat for cashing out tho - pick your cash out point, if it falls you can buy the dip if not, at least you got money
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:34:56
Well there was a slight depression on gdax so I bought some "evening out my numbers" vanity Bitcoin

Well let's see. All the existing customers lost fucking money because they legitimized a competing product against the product they have been selling.
So why be a client of a business that not only moves against your interest, but does so in an ambush-like manner
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:20:52
Last version I read forces FIFO
first in first out
So your earliest Bitcoin must be claimed first, causing a higher cap gains rate. Will affect traders who have year old cheap Bitcoin 
If they buy and sell, they lose the oldest Bitcoin they would normally save. And keep the newer bitcoin.
Sucks because it makes trading half a position less appealing - if you cash out completely you could be paying short term on all, because your old crypto has been converted to new crypto by trades over a period of time, even if only trading partial positions.

I read an article saying Hal cryofroze his body.
That's some next level shit. 
In the future they bring him back and he's the worlds richest man.

Man. I can see a situation were its HODL vs food for college student. Brutal.
Least they aren't selling beer and condoms.
Then all college kids would be nocoiners

Remember when part of this meme was used to make fun of people buying in at all time high.
Edit -geez this post is to my karma what Bitcoin is to my portfolio. Helpful though as I made this new account to have a safe way to post about crypto

It's better then going to jail for a few years! But get a professional. Even simply moving to a state you've been meaning to move to anyways, say Florida, could save 9%. Dont pay more then obligated, but obey the law. The IRS is nothing to mess with. Obviously USA related post.

Coinbase made a move that decreased the value of products it has been selling to its customers.
Why be a client of an entity that is actively working against your interest?

I want to cash out. My wife won't let me. We need to agree on a target level or it could get bad.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:35:02
I made money during all this. But those people have spouses, hopes, dreams too. Just the business but still, some people are feeling pretty bad now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:44:04
He doesn't - it's just propaganda from another btrash shill. Scaring people off coinbase = less Bitcoin sold
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:15:25
I didn't :)

Physiological means body issues. I think you meant the other word. But I agree with your point

Same thing we do. Celebrate. Share money dreams with family. Discuss risks. Decide to HODL or sell.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:34:07
Or you are just more bcash propaganda trying to scare people off coinbase because it doesn't sell your coin. This shits getting stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:48:34
Coinbase - lost of trust in customer interest

Yea, wouldn’t it be safer to buy on a recovery and miss the bottom by a little?
The recovery isn’t going to be a rocket, it’s gona be waves up and down just like the bear.

I remember all the complaining to mods.
“Can we please stop making memes every 1000 increase? It’s getting old.”
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:25:40
Wow. I just tossed a bunch in on the way up and sold in dec 17, all the while posting memes and having a blast.
You sure wasted a lot of energy.
