Dude, everything you're saying is valid. The bitcoin market it HIGHLY volatile, but the overall sum trend indicates growth. If i was in your position tho, since it seems like you already have a good investment portfolio, i'd invest low. Take Cuban's advice and Maybe ~10% of what you'd put into your other investments. 
But idk, i've built the conviction to see this bitcoin thing through, and thats why im unphased rn. Especially if you've been around the last couple months.

Lmao, welcome to the entire concept of investing. No1 ever definitively knows how well or bad a business will do or whether stocks will raise or lower...but you can speculate. Same deal here. There is no investment if there is no risk.
And If u think think the drama HERE is bad, literally enter ANY major stock exchange and you'd be floored by the chaos ensuing. Granted Bitcoin is way more volatile than stock, but as a result the returns tend to be much more significant in a much shorter time.
If you view the graph of the worth of bitcoin over a 1 year period, you'll see so far that every major dip is proceeded by an even greater rebound.

That is very optimistic of you. China has consistently been, especially in the last year, a pretty huge portion of BTC. They're a huge economy with investors who were smart to invest. 
By the 30th, it is undeniable that their hijinx will, in fact, hurt bitcoin. Whether we bounce back or not, its still too early to call, and to say definitively that it'll turn out 1 way or the other is unfounded.
I think it will eventually even out after this blow...but personally i've already sold off except for a $200 that i'll keep in the market to at least help support it in this tough time.
