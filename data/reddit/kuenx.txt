I once ordered 5 hemp seeds online from Amsterdam and had the cops knocking my door. I thought it was legal. But turns out that couple years earlier they had changed the law so that the seeds are now also classified as narcotics even though the seeds themselves don't contain any THC.
So I was charged with importing narcotics. I was lucky I got away with a fine and court fees. The cop said it doesn't matter how much I imported, it's the same crime. Lucky for me the judge was reasonable and didn't feel like setting an example or something.
But I'm probably on their list of drug lords now.

I live in a small apartment on the ground floor right above the the basements. My floor is always cold because the basements are freezing cold. If they weren't so loud I'd have a bunch of mining rigs to heat up my place.

You don't need more miners to send transactions. When the number of miners (and therefore hashpower) goes down the difficulty will adjust and the other miners will mine more blocks.  
Having lots of miners is good for security. But having them more spread across the world is better than having such a dominance in China.
I think it's not a bad thing that China is sending some of them away. These miners are not just going to shut down. They'll just move elsewhere. They spent massive amounts on hardware. Shutting down would mean they lose lots of money.

Yeah, basically Satoshi gave Bitcoin to the people, not to Bitcoin itself. Also the Bitcoin network is ran and controlled by people in the network and the people who make the software, not by the software.
I agree with your points. Autonomous software is the natural next step after the washing machine and basically anything that takes work off humans. The funny part is that even though many things nowadays are automated we still don't have less work. We just use more resources to make more stuff faster.  
It doesn't make sense for a machine to own itself. A machine doesn't require food, love, or anything apart from infrastructure to run on. So it can't do anything with the profits other than grow and expand. But why would a machine want to grow and expand if it has no benefits from being bigger. In the end, when machines will be so smart that they can do everything themselves and don't require humans to do work, there would be no point for the machine to exist - even from the machine's perspective. It can't even feel the joy of improvement or from competing with other machines.
It gets philosophical now :) Why would a machine want to exist? Can a machine "want"? Can it be made to think that it wants? hahah
So the machine has to be beneficial to humans and it can only have a reason to do so if it is also owned by humans. Like you said, in some sort of shareholder model. But then, a fully autonomous corporation, even if it has shareholders, would have no interest in pleasing them because it has no intrinsic interest in staying "alive". So it has to be controller by humans. Or animals once they out-smart us.

Well, currently the only reason to buy stuff in physical stores is that you can have your things *right now* - if the store has the item in stock - and that you can touch it first.
Many online stores have an easy return policy though. So you can buy stuff, touch it, try it, and if it doesn't fit or you don't like it, you can mail it back. This sounds like ecologic and economic disaster. But if you king about it, delivering items to a physical store, you actually going to the physical store, and then deciding that you don't want the product or finding out that your product is not available, also isn't very efficient at all.
So in the end, the only way I see physical stores survive is by providing competent staff that truly knows their products and can help you make decisions and therefore make your trip to the store worthwhile.
But currently such things are very rare. Staff is often completely incompetent and unmotivated.
Like, I recently went to a large electronics store and was looking for a USB GSM interface. They had no clue what I was talking about even though it was a store selling only electronics. After trying to explain myself for a while I mentioned the word "Internet stick" and they finally got it. They then sent me to the booth of a mobile carrier where they, of course, only had SIM-locked devices that come with a service plan. So I ended up going home disappointed with no device and ordered one off the Internet.
If you go to an electronics store, wouldn't you expect the staff to have knowledge of a broad range of electronic things and expert knowledge in some areas even?
What's the point of a physical store if not to have a competent person to assist you in deciding which item to buy?
Like, when I go to the drug store, they know everything about every little shit. They are like half doctors. When I go to the health food shop, they know everything about everything including other customer's feedback.
Why isn't it like that with other things like electronics and clothing? It's probably because we let them.

First time I ordered through them. Went really smooth. I ordered, paid, did some "internet stuff" and then it was here. This was from Kings Curry.
It probably depends on the restaurant. I've read some bad comments on some restaurants. One comment actually said they had called the restaurant only to find out that "Today we don't have anybody who checks the internet". Things like that are of course very bad.

The challenge would be a text string provided by the service. A random sequence of characters. You sign those characters using your private key and create a *signature* which is also a text string.  
The service can then verify whether the signature is good using the challenge and your public key. The Bitcoin address is a representation of your public key.
Ideally, the service would provide a new challenge every time you authenticate. This is to prevent replay attacks.
If the challenge was "elephant" and somebody came across your signature for "elephant", for example through network sniffing, they could use the exact signature so authenticate again. That's why the challenge has to be different every time and must be valid only once. Your signatures for "elephant" and "cat" will be completely different.

Lets say you buy a digital audio track (a song) from a web store, using Bitcoin of course. Then your hard drive crashes and your song is gone. So you will have to download it again.
**Scenario 1:**  
The store had you set up an account using email and password when you made the purchase. You log in and download the track again.
**Scenario 2:**  
The store *didn't* make you set up an account. But of course you can download it again if you are the person who purchased it.  
Because Bitcoin lets you create digital signatures using your Bitcoin addresses private key (the thing you use to make transactions), you can prove that you are the one who bought the song by signing a challenge with it. So the store will give you access to the song again.  
You just made a completely anonymous purchases without providing any information and the store was still able to identify you as the person who bought the song.
This project describes a standard way of handling **scenario 2**. It makes use of Bitcoin in terms of making the sending address of a transaction an identity.

The guy doesn't know what he's talking about. He thinks that when the dictator of a country forbids Bitcoin that the entire population is against it. He thinks that when Apple boycotts Bitcoin wallets that all Apple users don't want Bitcoin wallets.
His equation doesn't include the fact that all leaders of countries and companies who have ruled against Bitcoin have not necessarily ruled in favor of the majority of their people. But in selfishness of a few individuals.
If Apple had banned Bitcoin wallets because of their users complaining about them, well... But they haven't. They have banned Bitcoin because it might conflict with their own interests, not their customers' interests.
The governments haven't forbidden Bitcoin to protect their people. They have forbidden Bitcoin to protect their own personal interests.

We have a weird thing in Switzerland called "the 13th salary". At the end of the year you get paid a 13th paycheck. "13" because we usually get paid by the end of the month, not weekly. It's a standard thing and pretty much every company does that.
From the employee's perspective it often looks like "Yay, I'm getting an extra paycheck! Every year!" But in fact your yearly salary is divided by 13 instead of 12 and that 13th is held back in the company's account and the company gets the interest for it instead of the employee.
You could say the company saves money for you and in return you pay them your interest. Pretty weird though..

You guys are mixing things up. SMTP is neither federated or centralized or decentralized. SMTP is a communication protocol. A standardized language, optimized for Email messages, for machines to talk over TCP/IP.
Email, on the other hand, is federated. Email clients don't talk directly to each other (like Bitcoin). Instead, the sender's email client talks to their server (over SMTP) which then, unless sender and recipient are on the same server, talks to another server (over SMTP) which then stores the message. The recipient's email client then talks to their server (over IMAP, POP, etc) and asks for new messages and downloads them.
"Federated", in this context, has nothing to do with how state federations work. You don't have join a federation or what so ever. But in order to be an email server, the server does have to follow certain rules, best practices, and standards (SMTP being just one of them) in order to be compatible with other servers and for email to work.
One problem with SMTP is that, even though the body of an email can be encrypted (PGP), the metadata like sender and recipient (and even the subject) can't. What can be done, however, is communicate with SMTP over an encrypted transport (SSL/TLS). The problem with this is that even though the communication between servers is encrypted (including metadata), the encryption is not user-controlled, and after the data has been transmitted from one server to another or from an email client, the data is no longer encrypted. So, SSL (if trusted) will protect against sniffing but it doesn't protect against theft (legal or illegal) of the data on the server.

The US can not force them to give out any encryption keys, dump any data (even encrypted) or something like it - unlike what happened to Lavabit. They don't have to go to US courts, not even the secret ones. They only may no longer be able to travel to the US.
Nowadays "not located in the US" is used for marketing a lot. We've recently learned the the US can get data from US companies even if the data does not reside in the US physically.

I don't see this coming soon either. But I can imagine that there will be much more autonomous software services in the future. Like, the company of a friend of mine actually rents servers autonomously based on demand. I'm not sure though whether it uses its own funds but I don't think so. It it operated in an Bitcoin realm though, it could probably do that.
But for a machine or software to *own itself* and be a real DAC, I currently struggle to find a use-case where this actually makes sense.  
A software or machine doesn't come to existence just like that. So it initially requires a human to create it, even if the software could later create other software. Even the idea has to come from a human since something that doesn't exist can't have ideas.  
So either the human "gives birth" to the software for free and releases it to be its own, like a with child, or the machine pays the creator later after it has made some profits.
The first requires some sort of "parent" feeling from the human towards the machine. Like a parent wanting the child to mature and become autonomous without expecting anything in return. I don't see why one would have those towards a software that wants to make money.
The second, where the creator gets paid afterwards and the machine basically buys itself free doesn't make much sense either. If the creator created the software, why wouldn't he want to keep owning it.
A possible reason for the first could be if the DAC would provide a valuable service and is a non-profit DAC. But then the creator wouldn't actually give the DAC to itself but to the people it serves. Almost like releasing source code to the public domain, it would be releasing a self-sufficient service to the public domain.
The whole thing is very hard to grab.  
Bitcoin isn't really a DAC in my opinion. Bitcoin doesn't tell developers what features to implement. Bitcoin is only a network that finances its own transactions by charging people who initiate them and rewarding people who process them. It sure is very organic though.

But from the perspective of the buyer, not having the car papers signed over before the BTC transaction is confirmed is also some sort of "unconfirmed transaction". How can the buyer be sure you will hand over the papers after their money is gone for good?
The buyer would basically, before making the BTC transaction,  require a paper that guarantees them that you will hand them over the papers once the BTC transaction is confirmed. Or get they keys but not the paper before, or the other way around.
A cool way to resolve this would be if the ownership of the car was somehow stored inside the transaction (in the block chain), or bound to it.

No, I think you sign a challenge with the private key of the Bitcoin address you want to sign in with. This makes the term "sign in" become literal as you actually *sign* in.
The idea isn't new but it's still brilliant! Consider the following scenario:
Lets say you buy a service (e.g. web hosting) using Bitcoin from an online verice provider. Now in order to for the store to let you log in and manage your web hosting, the service provider needs you to setup an account with email, username, password, etc.
But if you paid with Bitcoin, they have your Bitcoin address and all they need to log you in is proof that you are the owner of the Bitcoin address the payment was made from. This can be achieved through signing a challenge with the private key of the bitcoin address you made the payment from. Without having to store any passwords. They can verify the signature against your Bitcon address / public key.
Also, instead of verifying you by your email address when communicating with the service, you could sign a challenge and include the signature in your email. This way they can be sure it's really you regardless of the email address you're communicating from.

As I understand, the email client is web-based so even if all the encryption and decryption happens in the browser you will have to trust the crypto code delivered by the server. If the company is US-based, the US government can force the company to deliver broken crypto code to the user and also force them to keep it a secret.  
If the company is based elsewhere and not in one of the Five Eyes (or similar) countries, the US government can't do that.
Bitcoin is different because everyone runs their own Software on their own computer. So Bitcoin is not affected by this. But if you use Blockchain.info, for example, you have to trust them that their code is fine. Though, Blockchain.info does a lot in helping you so that you would find out if they were forced to break the crypto code. For example, they offer browser extensions that let you verify the code against a public repository. If it doesn't match your browser won't load the page.

I've always wondered, what if there was a BitTorrent-like network where you could legally share and consume any type of copyrighted material. If you pay you can join the network. There would be some kind of monitoring that checks which files were downloaded how many times and the content creators/licensing companies would get paid based on the number of downloads of their content.
Everybody could provide content, seed their own rips, and so on.  
It would be peer-to-peer and wild but completely legal.
Things like rapidshare show that people are willing to pay for content. They just want it tn their preferred format, not half a year too late.
I really like Netflix. The price is okay (unless you live outside the US). But there needs to be at least 1000 times more content and you should be able to download the file so you can watch it when you're offline or don't have decent Internet speed or on a device that can't run a Netflix client.

@_date: 2013-03-08 23:36:23
I've had a similar thought. It would be really nice to have a card that you could just swipe and it would make a transaction.
But your solution will not work. The transaction list on the card can not be trusted (from the perspective of the merchant) because it could be manipulated. I don't think there is a solution without Internet.
The problem is that the card is a passive device. It can't do anything but provide (and maybe store) data. It can't compute anything.
For a card solution to work, the card would have to store the private key of your wallet (ideally encrypted). When you insert the card, you decrypt your key using a password and the terminal would make a transaction and sign it with your key. Then it submits the transaction in to the Bitcoin network. The problem with this is that the terminal has to temporarily know your private key and you would have to trust the terminal that it won't keep a copy of the key.
Another solution would be to develop an entirely new card that has a tiny processor that can sign transactions. So when you insert your card in to the terminal, the terminal would power up the card and submit the transaction information. The transaction would then be signed *on the card* and submitted back to the terminal. And the terminal would then submit the transaction in to the Bitcoin network. 
This is very similar to sending Bitcoin from an offline wallet to an online wallet. Where you sign a transaction on an offline computer and transfer the data e.g. via USB stick on to an online computer and submit it.

@_date: 2013-03-04 23:12:06
Yes, this would be the ideal solution. Have a BTC debit balance and automatically make a sell order at the marked price of the used currency every time something is being purchased with the card.
This would be an interesting concept since during the time between the purchase and the sell order we would have a negative balance (CREDIT) in the foreign currency (e.g. USD) and at the same time a positive balance in BTC (DEBIT). That'd be like a hybrid card.
An extra bonus would be to be able to make direct purchases in BTC if the CC gateway supported it. Then it would be like a BTC banking card too.

A good way: You could buy something physical with PayPal and sell it on [Bitmit]( for Bitcoin. But this is by no means the fastest way.
~~Another good way: Withdraw the money from PayPal to your bank account, then transfer the money from your bank account to a BTC stock exchange and puchase Bitcoins. But that's also not really fast.~~ since you said "without cashing it"
There is most likely almost nobody willing to sell Bitcoin for PayPal without huge margins due to the risk of chargeback fraud. Because Bitcoin is digital and irreversible and I do not have proof that I have sent it to you, you could call up PayPal and claim that you have not received the coins and have the money refunded without me getting my BTC back. So from the seller-side there is a big risk of getting fucked over.
This is how PayPal protects buyers from scamming sellers. But it does not protect sellers from scamming buyers.

Yes, enough randomness. I am not a mathematician but I think the rest of the math is just to bring the number into a new number that makes sense for their game and to ensure that each number has equal probability of appearing.
They have random bits from the block chain and they need a number between 0 and 36. So they have to do some math to get it.

Interesting. Have you heard of [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( algorithm? It lets you split a key in, for example, 3 parts and it takes 2 parts to reconstruct the key.
This way you could split the cold storage key in 3 parts and give them to 3 trusted friends. It will always take 2 people to reconstruct the cold storage key. This way you don't have to trust a single person and your customers would also sleep better if the knew that you alone can't run off with the cold coins.
One disadvantage: You can never let 2 of the 3 friends be on the same train, car or plane, eat the same foods and so on. If 2 of 3 die at the same time, you're fucked. But the algorithm lets you configure the number of splits.

I get to ride for about an hour a day, 20 minutes of which up a hill (avg. 5% steep). And I'm always in a hurry. I overtake the bike messengers and even the electric bikes. So I do get my heart rate up frequently (and down quickly). But thrills me too much, I think.
I also use a kettlebell. I don't have time to do it in the morning, so i do it at night. It doesn't make me tired at all. Instead, the effect I get from it is being able to really focus on coding  and concentrate. But it won't let me sleep until 4am.

If you want to help the network by running a full node, forward port 8333 to the machine running BitcoinQt or bitcoind to allow incoming connections, or enable UPnP on your router. 
Though, with UPnP any program/device can open ports for inbound traffic. Maybe you won't want that. Through manual port forwarding you'll have more control and security.

In case of the latter, I could set something up that I would host myself and I could provide you with a JavaScript snippet or an iframe. The thing is, if you want a real-time ticker, you need something that can serve WebSockets.
I have already implemented real-time price tickers [here]( for a number of exchanges. This site is not 100% stable yet and it doesn't even show in Internet Explorer, but the price updates work fine and I could extend it to serve a custom ticker just for you under a special URL for a small fee.

Since they are a profit-oriented (or planning to be profitable) company, I don't think "donations" is the right thing. Or would you donate to your local super market because they are planning to launch a product you like? I think donations are for non-profits and individuals doing things for free. And of course the needy.
Donations would be appropriate if they were going to open-source all the code and specs and sell the machines as complete-kits with low margins.
Instead, since they are going to launch a cool product and we want it to happen, a better way to help them out would probably be by promising them to buy an ATM from them once they have it ready. Kinda Kickstarter-style. Maybe preordering and paying up-front so they have money to cover production costs. Or invest in their business if they let you.
It's like bitcoinstore.com. They have a cool service but I wouldn't just give them money as donations. To support them I would just buy stuff from them instead of elsewhere. And spread the word.

[BitSprinkle]( is currently suffering from the same problem. But I really don't want to do things manually. I was thinking of this service to be something that I create and it will just run by itself forever, funded by donations and ad revenue.
I have figured out that those eggs are the default avatar on Twitter. They have file names like "default_profile_1_normal.png" and "default_profile_2_normal.png". So most likely what I am going to do is block Twitter accounts that use the default avatar (default_profile_ANY NUMBER_normal.png). So who ever is creating those accounts will at least have to change the picture.
But this sucks. This is not what I created BitSprinkle for. It's meant to help people who want to get started with Bitcoin. Not a Bitcoin milking machine. Motherfuckers...

Collective investments are a great way of letting big things happen. But I'm not talking about simple "savings". I'm talking about people hoarding literally millions and billions because it's financially lucrative. And they manage that their wealth makes them even more wealthy. And at the same time their wealth gives them lots of political power letting them lobby for things that open the scissors between rich and poor even further.
I live in Switzerland and we're told that we have the most direct democratic system in the world. But money still overpowers the people. If a lobby is financially strong enough, new laws will simply go through and we'd have to start a referendum. 
If more money means more political power and it's still called democracy then the the system is defective by default. No person should have more power than another person.

Using the block chain as a random number generator they can prove that they have no control over the number generated and can therefore not cheat in their own game.
Any anyone can verify whether the used number they claim to be the random seed is actually the number from the latest block.

That's correct. When moving to secure comminucation, maybe moving to secure devices that run secure operating systems would also make sense. Any form of secure communiction for iPhones is a bit ironic anyway, when Apple can get at your keys. Don't know about Android or Windows.
Secure comminucation is only as secure as the weakest entity in the whole chain. Whether it's the software, the OS, the firmware or the user.
It's probably impossible to make anything 100% secure. But using operating systems that are artificially made insecure and contain backdoors is definitively not productive regarding privacy and security.
We have learned that encryption or security software that is not open-source can not be trusted. But how is an operating system not security software? It (often) holds your keys! So why do people then trust closed-source operating systems?

Good question. 
It depends on the Bitcoin client you're using. If y you're using the official Bitcoin client, the blockchain will be stored on disc (your stick). And you will always have to wait until it's synced before you can make payments. This is not ideal for a mobile/portable Bitcoin solution.
There are clients that don't store their own blockchain and instead use a server to access the blockchain. 
The [Electrum]( Bitcoin client, for example, uses a server (you don't have run your own, but you can) to access the blockchain. But all the cryptography happens locally on your computer. The server is only used to determine your balances, fetch public keys and submit transactions.

If you want to store the blockchain there too, you'll eventually need a really large USB key. Terrabytes - in a couple years! But I wouldn't recommend it as it does a lot of write-operations making your flash memory "age".
Depending on the distribution, Linux is not going to need a large flash drive. I don't think "small" flash drives are even sold any more. A 4GB USB key is way enough. But Kingston now sells 512 GB USB3 keys (1TB coming) if you want to get fancy.

I like this and I have bookmarked it.
Have you thought about providing the ability to get a notification when the download is finished? Maybe send an email or tweet. For people who want to integrate this into an app or service, you would allow them to provide a callback url where you will send the download links to the files to. Or put the files directly in to their Dropbox.
I currently see 3 use-cases for this service.
* I'm at the office and it suddenly comes to my mind that I want to watch a certain "file" when I get home. So i start the torrent and schedule the pizza. Pretty cool but: When I'm home I will have to download the file again over HTTP(S). It'd be awesome if the files were just ready in my Dropbox already sunched with my computer. However this would downgrade anonymity significantly.
* My provider throttles P2P/BitTorrent traffic and I'm faster using your service.
* I don't want to seed.

Yeah. But mining with renewable energy should give the miners a bigger reward. Something like that. Making green coins more expensive wouldn't be much of a motivation and it's counter-logic.
It's funny... green energy is more expensive. My flat runs 100% on solar power that I buy from my local energy provider. I pay more than triple of what I would pay if I used nuclear energy. It's like that because producers of nuclear energy do not have to pay for (the creation and planning of) uranium disposal sites. The state (i.e. tax payers) pays it. And they do not have to pay compensation to people living next to nuclear power plants.

No. Not necessarily. If somebody finds a way to make secure Bitcoin physical paper wallets and can build a successful reputation, it can certainly work out. It's all about reputation.
As I said, [Casascuis]( has done this. The problem with his coins is that they are too expensive to manufacture so be useful for trade. That's why people keep them and don't use them to pay things.
What you need is a physical body (e.g. paper) that can securely carry a private key and gets destroyed when the private key is revealed. Then you need to be trusted by the people who use your money.

If you know JavaScript, you could do it in Node.js. There are modules to subscribe real-time twitter feeds matching a certain criteria. Then you'd need to react on each message, find the recipient's Bitcoin address and trigger a payment e.g. as a HTTP request to the blockchain.info API (like in crookiemoonster's Python example) or using the JsonRPC API of your Bitcoin client.
Whether it's easy or hard depends how complex you want it to be. If you want people to only get BTC once per Twitter account, you'd have too keep track of those Twitter IDs in a database.

You have to consider that they make an effort by meeting you in person. 
If they add 5% to the MtGox price they are currently making about 3 bucks. This probably barely covers the cost for gas for the car, bananas for the bicycle or public transportation ticket to get to the meeting point. Let alone the time effort. And they had the effort to get the Bitcoins in the first place.
I don't do it because I want to desperately sell my coins. I do it for the fun of it and because people want to get small amounts of Bitcoin without making an account at an exchange. Or without linking their bank account to a Bitcoin transaction. Or because they need them fast. So I add a certain percentage (LocalBitcoins lets you enter a formula) to the MtGox price as an insurance so I can re-purchase the coins without losing money.

I don't have a Phd in Dog, but I think if you buy specific breeds, you have to make sure it's not one of those over-bred sick breeds where the animal has health issues because of that. Like joint issues, problems with sight and many other things.
And dogs have been severely genetically manipulated so that there are breeds with significantly different properties. Like size, fur and what not. And putting a dog in an environment that does not suit its properties is torture. A Chiwawa will freeze in Siberia and a husky will be too warm in the Caribbean. Not everybody takes those things i consideration when "adopting" a dog.

I don't think it's that big of a deal. Websites are always hosted somewhere and are therefore "centralized". Ideally, the operators create regular off-site backups so the sites can easily be moved in case the hosting company goes crazy.
Of course, bitcointalk is an important platform for communication amongst the Bitcoin community. However, both sites are not necessary for Bitcoin transactions to work properly. blockchain.info provides similar info to blockexplorer. And everyone with a full copy of the blockchain can look up transactions themselves.
But you are also partly right. If people rely too much on blockexplorer, blockexplorer could provide wrong data and we'd simply believe it. People don't really cross-check things.
If you are worried, create a similar site to blockexplorer so there will be another option for people and maybe create a browser extension that provides methods to verify the data provided on blockexplorer by checking against other blockchains. And offer bitcointalk to mirror their data so you could jump in in case of an emergency.

False. The reason it takes hashing power to generate coins is to initially distribute the coins in a broad range and to have a calculable inflation rate until all Bitcoins have been generated.

LocalBitcoins provides an escrow service to prevent fraud for online transactions. Basically the seller puts the Bitcoins in to a special wallet from LocalBitcoins where he can no longer access them and the buyer can not yet access them. Then the buyer can send the money. Once the money has arrived, the seller can release the Bitcoins to the buyer.
The prevents a lot.

BitPay offers the other way around. However, if your customers buy in USD anyway, what keeps you from automatically depositing the USD on, say, MtGox and selling for BTC?
Many banks offer transaction information in a machine-readable format so you could do this in an at least semi-automatic fashion. Maybe some banks also have an interface to automatically make transactions.
Like so (semi-automatic way):
* Your software reads your transaction log from the USD bank account
* Your software shows you the amount you have received in USD
* You manually make a transaction of the given USD amount to MtGox
* Your software notices a balance update on MtGox
* Your software automatically places a BUY order on MtGox
But I don't know of a payment processing provider who does all that for you.

Yes, the gateway can probably do what it wants and you have to trust it. But with credit cards, if you find a weird transaction on your monthly statement, you can just call the credit card company and tell them to reverse the transaction and they will do it.
With Bitcoin, transactions can't be undone. So if the gateway steals your information or is cheating on you, your money is gone.
Bitcoin allows us to make really secure banking if only we keep our private key private. So why make it insecure.

[The brain-damaged color blind five year-old was me]( Sorry for the ads. They're there so support the funds.
But you are right. Many things in Bitcoin are far from shiny and sometimes look worse than some websites built in the 90s. And it might scare or turn some people off. Crappy looking things are, after all, a sign for bad quality in the minds of many people. On the other hand, the Bitcoin website especially should not look too fancy. If the site looked like it was made by an expensive superstar design guru ninja from 2 times the future, people might get the wrong impression that there's a corporation behind the Bitcoin project.
Many Bitcoin related sites are brand new and are often simply a proof of concept. Companies and projects are starting around Bitcoin. People sometimes just want to start a project or business and see how it works. Good designers are expensive and as new projects tend to morph quite a bit, designers would have to redesign and re-conceptualize often. But then, some projects just don't give a shit about design and they will core-dump you in the face if you tell them that their design sucks. Sometimes it's just not important. I mean look at [MPEx]( No design, nobody cares.
The official Bitcoin client, however, is a complete disaster. People hear about Bitcoin as the currency from the future and when they finally get the program it looks like a standard Windows XP software. Then they have to wait 2 days (i.e. leave it running) until finally they can do something with it. Well at least receive coins. I see many boners deflate during the sync. 
There should be an advanced client that downloads the blockchain and a beginner's client that uses a server and therefore lets you start right away. Like Electrum. The official clients should look like modern quality software.

It's a business-to-business currency. It's still being used. Companies sometimes pay each other parts in WIR. 
It makes sense for small businesses. Imagine you are a small business and you do not have enough cash to pay for a service from another company that you need. One thing you could do is ask investors to increase your capital. Another thing you could do is pay some of the service with regular money and pay the rest with a promise to return a favor of equal value. The WIR currency is basically a form to exchange favor-dept. 
Some companies pay out small bonuses  to their employees in WIR. There is a WIR catalog with consumer products.

I was looking for a way for people to make donations to a project of mine, where both the donor and me would remain anonymous. So cash in the mail wasn't an option either.
I googled for "anonymous donations" and eventually landed on an article about Bitcoin. I screened it briefly and figured "oh, it's a different currency... nobody has that anyway". So I ditched the idea.
Then about mid 2011 I kind of stumbled upon another article that gave me a better idea about Bitcoin, so I bought 25 coins for about $5 each, hoping to buy something awesome with it. But I couldn't find anything useful.
Then I sort of forgot about them for a while. I had them in my account at bitmarket.eu and when I came back (BTC at about $10) I learned that this was a big mistake. The guy at Bitmarket had "invested" the BTC people had in their wallets and "lost" them. It was somehow Bitcoinica related.

Yes, the act as a middleman and hold the coins during the transaction. This way the seller can't simply walk away with the cash without sending the Bitcoins.
It works like this:
* The buyer sees my ad on on localbitcoins.com and clicks "buy"
* He then enters the amount he wants to spend in his local currency (CHF in this case)
* He gets a secret verification code for the transaction
* I (the seller) get an email and a Bitcoin address that I have to fund with the desired amount
* We both agree on a place and time for the transaction in the transaction comments section
* After I have funded the Bitcoin address (3 confirmations required) provided by LocalBitcoins, the buyer gets a notification that the Bitcoins have been deposited
* Optionally, I can enable escrow. If enabled, his means that I can no longer cancel the deal. Only the buyer or LocalBitcoins staff can cancel the transaction. This makes sense when selling Bitcoins electronically where the buyer has to send me the money first. Like with a bank wire/SEPA transaction. But this example is for a face-to-face transaction. So escrow is not really needed.
* I then print out a receipt with a QR code that contains an URL to release the deposited coins to the seller's wallet on LocalBitcoins
* Then we meet: I wait at the meeting point looking suspicious. A guy shows up and says "Hello? Bitcoin?"
* The buyer gives me the cash
* I scan the QR code on the receipt with my phone and press the "release" button
* The Bitcoins are now on the buyer's LocalBitcoins wallet
* My phone now shows the same verification code that the buyer has received in the beginning
* I read the code to the buyer and he can verify it against his. If they are the same, it means I didn't cheat and everything went well
* The transaction is complete
* The buyer can then, back home, transfer the Bitcoins from his LocalBitcoins wallet to his real wallet
Sounds like a lot of steps but it's really easy and straight-forward. Because this was my first time, I created a second LocalBitcoins account and played it through (sold to myself) once so we wouldn't both stand there not having a clue.
I really recommend this. You get to meet other Bitcoin people and maybe have an interesting chat. And if you don't want to, you don't have to do much talking. Just take the cash and release the coins. You can also wear sunglasses and not talk at all.
I think I'll keep doing this just as a hobby for as long as it's fun :)

A blockchain.info wallet is half-online, sort of. 
Unlike with the official Bitcoin client, with a blockchain.info wallet you don't have to download the block chain - the thing your BitcoinQt wallet needed so long to download/synchronize. It's a copy of every Bitcoin transaction that ever happened. The public ledger. Instead, blockchain.info hosts a copy of the block chain and and lets you access and submit data through an API.
They also host an encrypted file that contains your Bitcoin addresses and their private keys. But they don't know your keys because they are encrypted with your password and are decrypted in your browser only, never on their servers. So they don't even have to know your password.
With a blockchian.info wallet, all the encryption and signing is happening in your browser and their servers are only used to submit transactions and access data. This is unlike most other web wallets where everything happens on the server.
So it's the closest to a traditional desktop Bitcoin wallet that a web wallet can get. You can access it from everywhere and you don't have to download too much stuff. While with a regular Bitcoin client you have to download gigabytes of data.
They let you export your private keys - which you should do (and keep save) - so you can import them in to any other Bitcoin client in case their servers are unavailable or get stolen.
**Edit**: The rule of thumb is that you only keep the Bitcoins that you want to use for regular day-to-day transactions in a wallet that's on your computer or on blockchain.info. Your long-term savings should be stored in an offline wallet. That's a bitcoin address that was generated on a computer that has never touched the Internet and is then printed to paper and stored. You can save [bitaddress.org]( to disc, transfer it to an offline computer, generate a paper wallet and print it out.

Well he is certainly trying to monetize our hate on certain industries. I don't doubt that. 
The thing is, tech-savvy people have always had access to cryptography and I personally believe that I would know how to communicate securely over public channels such as the Internet. But the average Joe doesn't. By trying to make big money with a company who's business model is basically making privacy/cryptography available to average people and by making huge marketing campaigns about it - I mean, he even sings! - he is promoting cryptography in general along the way. Most people will jump on the train when something is properly commercialized and has proper marketing. I don't like it, but it's like that. He is making people aware of encryption and of how important it is - even if he's just doing it for the money. Because people will begin to ask "is it encrypted" when using other services, too. And that's progress.
You might know how to encrypt your email using GPG, but do you know many people who would know how to decrypt it? I used to attach cryptographic signatures to my emails but all I got was replies of people wasking how the could "open the file" thinking it was a picture or so. Encryption and encryption-awareness needs to become the standard.
While Mega and his future ventures are most likely primarily for making money, I believe he is also making it a bit of a personal battle. From a personal point of view, I do believe that certain governments and institutions are taking it way too far when it comes to surveillance and spying of people. Countries all over the world are more and more trying to imprison their own people through things like that. The governments have become extremists in this matter. And Kim Dotcom is an extremist in the opposite direction with enough force to make an impact. We need more extremists to balance things out.

So basically: You use something you can remember instead of random data to generate the key.

So you want to have access to the data on the Bitcoin network without downloading the blockchain and without using somebody else's blockchain through an API? I don't think this is how it's supposed to work.
You could have Bitcoin node that listens for data without storing anything and reacts upon certain events. But you don't need a CLI program for that. You need something that runs as a daemon and you could do it in PHP. But you'd have to implement part of the Bitcoin protocol which probably isn't an easy task.
But if you'd tell us what exactly you are trying to do, maybe we could give you more useful help. You don't have to tell us about your secret business plan. Just tell us about the problem you are trying to solve. All the other posts ware legitimate and valid answers to your question.

I'm not sure what exactly he means by 'Bitcoin credit card'. Does that mean we get a card with Bitcoins on it and can go in depths and and pay back with interest?

Not everything that's called "coin" is something like Bitcoin. If Google released a Google Coin it would probably be something like a voucher that could be exchanged for Google services. Just like Amazon Coins are essentially accumulable tiny vouchers. And vouchers have been there for a while, they just haven't been called a "coin" very often. You can buy vouchers with Bitcoin.

An email client with integrated asymmetric encryption is something the world needs pretty soon. In fact, encryption should have been the standard for email since the beginning.
PGP/GPG integration for email clients has been there for a while. It's a bit of a pain to get it working. And that's a big problem. Because the other person will have to (partially) know how encryption works and how to integrate it into e.g. Thunderbird.
I used to PGP sign all my emails for a while but I ended up receiving phone calls of people asking me what that weird thing at the bottom of the email was or how they could open the attachment containing the signature. When I explained the that it's a signature if so that they could make sure it was really me sending the mail they said "lol, of course it from you, it shows your email at the top."
Email encrypting and signing needs to become the standard. It would instantly and effectively fight spam and phishing and spying. Most people realize know that/why they need encryption. I hear the "I have nothing to hide" thing pretty often.
I think the best way to get people to encrypt their communication is to integrate it so seamlessly and beautifully that they don't have to think about it. You just hit send and it says "encrypting... contacting server... email sent".

Do you mean banks? Banks do not deserve to continue to operate they way they do. No matter how much revenue their business is generating. If something is wrong, it does not deserve to be supported. And if you think that something is wrong, boycott is the most efficient way of protest. There are some shops here that hate the banks and said "we only accept *real money*" (meaning paper cash and coins). But paper money is also issued (and created) by the banks. 
Bitcoin finally gives us (in the future, if everything works out) the tools to actually do transactions without the involvement of corrupt and evil monetary institutions.
The current money system is all but democratic. It seemed legit in the beginning when paper money was 100% backed by gold. This is no longer the case. Fiat currency is now completely virtual and it's a group of powerful institutions who decide what *your* money is worth and under which terms you can spend it.
This is not okay. It's a system where the banks and governments profit at your cost. It's time to go back to a currency where supply and demand control its value. And because gold sucks at splitting and transferring, it will be Bitcoin.

Yeah "good products and services" is a niche market ;)
Edit: Most people just don't know that they like good things because they have never seen them. If you don't have to be profitable, you can just start making good things and let people experience it. Then they will come.
But in in cities where rent is so expensive (like here, Zurich), businesses that try to create something unique and good usually go bankrupt before people even know about the place. There is no room to experiment. Everything has to be set up for maximum profit from day 1. That's why don't have nice and cute and friendly things anymore.

You should have. People sometimes throw papers like this away because they don't know what to do with it or think it's a scam. And you would have just wasted money. 
Keep a copy of the private key and and if the money has not been claimed after 2 months, take it back. It's like if you would have given her a $5 bill. If she doesn't want to have it there is no shame to take it back.

A phone with NFC support can send/receive anything through the NFC interface. It's an active device. A card, however, can only provide the info stored on the chip and can't read. It's passive.
So, NFC-enabled phones could receive payment requests and return signed transactions to a payment gateway through NFC. I think some already do.

If Bitcoin is going to be the defacto standard of electronic payments (i.e. kills PayPal and all the others simply because it's better), the price per Bitcoin is going to increase significantly.
If Bitcoin becomes a worldwide major method of payment everywhere else, you may retire at some nice place soon.
I believe in it. Bitcoin is the only currency controlled by supply and demand that is also practical to buy things with (e.g. metals aren't). I don't see why it should fail.

Regarding your idea:
* You can not make a payment with a Bitcoin address. You can only receive payments
* The magnetic strip would have to contain the private key which is something you should never give to anybody
* It has been discussed before and there is no secure solution without a device that can sign its own transactions (i.e. a small computer)

I'm still having a hard time believing how PayPal can legally freeze somebody else's money. Is it really legal for them to freeze an account without a court order?
I understand that PayPal can refuse a transaction. They shouldn't, but they probably can. But if you are planning to refuse service to an existing customer, shouldn't you tell them a month or two *before* you shut them down?
@_date: 2013-03-05 01:42:57
It would be perfect for them. And for the customers, there wouldn't be any weird records on the credit card statement. I think if the pron industry wanted, they could even "force" people to use Bitcoin. By simply selling their stuff for BTC, people will buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-04 08:55:52
That's what I'm saying. I think both should be okay as long as you are in the posession of it and the item is legal. Selling a USB device or selling a position in the queue for buying something should be fine as long as you are in the posession of either the device or the position.
If you can't sell your position in a pre-order queue, then you also can't sell vouchers because with both things it is beyond your control whether the issuer of the voucher will be able to deliver the final product. Like if I buy an Amazon voucher and Amazon closes down before I can redeem it. Not the seller's problem.

I would stop working for money and instead invest all my time in  projects that I consider important, help out charities, create more free software, support people who make the world better, help creative people, promote bicycling and sustainable living more. I want there to be at least as many bike repair stands and tube venting machines as gas stations. I just want to have time to make people happier. There are so many things...
I often come across businesses that suck just because they can afford it and force things and products upon people because they have no choice. I sometimes thought, what if I created the same business but without the suckage? What if I created a business with happy employees that are also happy to see a customer because they love what they're doing and have fun doing it and don't feel cheated on because their salary does not suck? Why is there not a single single healthy sandwich in the sandwich store??
I'd create small businesses that serve niche markets that are not necessarily highly profitable. I'd help business and people employ technologies and things that free them from being slaves of the powerful folks - such as Bitcoin.

I think the idea behind Bitcoin is to have a secure payment network and a inflation-safe currency controlled by the people and not the banks/governments.
It's not intended to be a profit-train that you can hop on. People should get into Bitcoin because they believe that it's superior method of transferring and storing value. If everyone just used Bitcoin for speculation, the price will get any higher. The true value of Bitcoin is the whole economy that is evolving around it. The more people and businesses use Bitcoin, the more demand there will be and the more valuable a single Bitcoin will eventually become.
That's why I don't see a problem with a Bitcoin being sold even for a million USD. The more valuable a Bitcoin becomes, the less Bitcoins you will spend for a certain good. If it wasn't like that we'd be spending $470,000 USD for a pizza now.

But he missed an important aspect in the difference between Bitcoin and PayPal. Bitcoin transactions are directly from A to B, while PayPal transactions are from A to PayPal and then to B. And PayPal has to agree that B can receive money from A. If they don't, they will freeze B's account. And if A decides they want the money back, PayPal will do it most likely without even asking B.

I'm not sure but I think pulling back a bank wire transfer is significantly harder than, say, a credit card transaction.
But I might be wrong - hope not. 
I remember a story where someone accidentally sent money to the wrong account. The bank said they couldn't just undo the transaction, the owner of the wrong account would have to trigger the reversal. And they even refused to give out the contact information of the account owner.
Then I remember having read another story where the bank made a mistake and accidentally moved a 6-figure sum to the wrong account ans simply undid the transaction. The guy was thrilled when he saw the new sum on his account and had already started moving the money to other accounts and withdrew all he could from ATMs. Didn't help.

No it's bullshit. The paper wallets are actual Bitcoin wallets (private keys). Not certificates or anything alike.

This is a general problem on Android (maybe other systems too). Apps seem to want to have all the permissions in reserve. Or they are just too lazy to figure out what permissions they actuall need.
There should really be more focus on requiring the smallest set of permissions possible. And there should be on-demand permissons. There's an app the shows you all the permissions an app has and when they have last been used. Turns out many apps have permissions that they never use.
Some apps have access to your entire life. Scary..

I don't think paper wallets were meant for this. A paper wallet is a private key (usually on paper) that has never touched the Internet and only exists in a non-digital form. It is therefore unhackable. But still stealable physically.
Using paper wallets as notes doesn't work just like that. The private key on the wallet must be protected in a way that when it is redeemed it renders the note void. Casascius, who makes the physical Bitcoin coins, uses a hologram sticker to cover the private key. To redeem the money, the sticker has to be broken and the coin becomes worthless.
But that's not enough. Since somebody has to make those notes, this person/entity must be trusted to not keep a copy of the private keys. So if you want to give somebody a Bitcoin note, the other party to whom you are giving it to must trust the issuer of the note and he/she can only give it to other people who also trust the issuer.
You can not just print paper wallets and spread them in to the world. People will not trust them unless you have a widely known reputation as a trustable issuer.

Can they really? If Bitcoin is a commodity, they can forbid import and export and trade to, in to and within the US. But they cannot forbid Bitcoin itself. Or can they? I'm not a lawyer. 
If Bitcoin is a currency, then it would be just another foreign currency, just like the Euro or Swiss Francs. As far as I'm concerned, it is not illegal for people or businesses to accept foreign currencies. Imagine all US people would suddenly start to accept CHF and use this currency to trade within each other, simply ignoring the USD. Would that be illegal? The finance people to it all the time and every day. They might as well use Bitcoin.
Or am I just thinking too logically?

Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment platform. Gold is just a currency. 
As a payment system, Bitcoin is the most technologically advanced and secure thing out there. Payments go directly from A to B while with classic electronic payment systems (credit cards, bank wire, etc) payments go through several entities before they reach the recipient. All the entities in between have to agree with A paying B - the could simply not process your payment if they want. PayPal and Visa/MasterCard have proven this.
And with no one in the middle as with Bitcoin, risks and fees are extremely low. So it makes perfect sense for people to not only wanting to use Bitcoin as a store of value/investment but also as a payment system. In fact - for me - the payment system part is what makes up for Bitcoin's true value. And it's fast!

Sad... The Silk Road was a platform where people could buy and sell drugs - something which they will do anyway - but without any Mafia organizations or cartels in their necks due to it's anonymity.
Ideally, people would grow their own weed locally and sell it. There has been an article recently stating that Switzerland doesn't import a lot of weed because most weed is grown inside people's homes and sold to friends. This is an ideal situation because no big drug orgenizations ever have to get involved. And Switzerland's people grow some of the strongest and purest weed in the world.
We need a decentralized and anonymous drug economy without the governments involved. This would essentially elmiminate the entire drug war and the impurity of the substances. Everyone should just make their own drugs and share it with friends.

My MasterCard has a built-in NFC chip that I can just touch the gateway with. No PIN needed. It works only for small transactions though.
I think there's even an iPhone app from MasterCard and maybe you can use it to pay through your phone's NFC interface. But I have no idea, my phone doesn't have a popular operating system :(
With Bitcoin, a passive card with NFC won't work because of Bitcoin's security. Transactions would have to be signed on the card so it would have to be an active device capable to sign transactions.
The reason this works with credit cards is because the technology provides very little security. The NFC just provides your payment details to the gateway. Anyone with your credit card info could use money from your card. You basically check your bill afterwards to see whether all transactions were legit.

I am not entirely sure how Big Cartel works, but if I get it right, it's a hosted online store platform that you can customize.

A Bitcoin faucet gives people a very small amount of Bitcoin for free so they can try out Bitcoin and see how awesome it is. They can make a transaction, see their balance change and observe what happens. They can make sure it does something.
It's really hard for people new to Bitcoin to get a feel of how it works. Many people want to see how it works before they buy in. After all, getting Bitcoin requires some research and a faucet giving them a mBTC or so significantly helps them to overcome their inhibitions.

The whole thing sounds very interesting, and I am assuming its powerfulness will unfold once a sufficient number of people will have formed a large enough network with enough of diversity (i.e. people willing to trade one currency for another). 
Does that mean that gateways will eventually become obsolete once the network is large enough that you'd be able to convert anything into anything using only your peers/friends? Or will they remain necessary as a way to trade with the "outside world"?

* The site says "We register on your behalf." Maybe you could elaborate a bit more in detail how it works. Does it mean you create a new account and send me the credentials? What if I already have an account and just want you to purchase or upgrade a subscription? What to I have to do in order to let you do that? Change my password? Get rid of all personal information?
* There is still no real information about who you are. You don't provide a real name, a real address and all that. Without knowing who you are, how can I make you accountable if you don't fulfill your part of the deal? If you aren't a registered company
* I couldn't find the terms of service. A page that, legally binding, describes in detail what your service is, how long you take to fulfill it, how you deal with privacy and all those things. You might take a look at other services' ToS and see what they are covering. These things are often written by lawyers.
* Also, how far does does your interpretation of "anonymous" go? How do you make sure that there is no trace back to your customer? Do you have a way to make sure that communication between you and your customer are never disclosed, even if your infrastructure gets seized by an authority?

The whole process seemd way over complicated. It says they used LocalBitcoins. So why did they trade on the MtGox price?  
On LocalBitcoins the amount and price are fixed as soon as the buyer clicks the button and the BTC are locked in escrow after depositing. There is no "sending too much or too little" or typing in addresses. There is just depositing and releasing. All thet happens in person is the fiat changing the owner and the seller releasing the BTC.

That is true. The operator would have to hold back the Bitcoins until the charge-back period is due. I think that's usually 3 to 6 months. Or, which is more convenient but less attractive, the operator charges a huge fee to cover the risk of charge-back fraud.

The problem is that credit cards allow charge-backs while with Bitcoin this is not possible / can only happen voluntarily. 
So, say somebody purchased something from your business and would issue a charge-back, the credit card company would reverse the transaction while your payment processor would be unable to reverse the Bitcoin transaction.
This would severely suck for the payment processor. And that's why there is nobody doing this and that's also why almost nobody will sell you Bitcoins through PayPal and such.
I'm not sure if there is a maximum timespan for filing credit card charge-backs. If there is one - say for example  3 months - a payment processor doing what you are looking for could work like this:
* Make credit card transaction
* Hold the money for 3 months (maximum charge-back timespan)
* Then sell the money for BTC
* And transfer it to your Bitcoin address
But you wouldn't want to wait that long to receive your payment, would you? The best way is probably to accept Bitcoin and government-issued currency through different payment processors.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:52:45
One big con of PayPal is: If you send somebody money through PayPal, the payment goes from you to PayPal and then from PayPal to your friend. If PayPal does not agree with you sending money to your friend, they will freeze the money and sometimes they won't even tell you why.
If PayPal would simply process payments - which is their job, I'd probably say PayPal offers a decent service. But PayPal is putting their own (or their friends's/governments) political opinions in the game. This is not part of payment processing, this is payment censorship and policing.

Correct. Every time you swipe your card you are giving somebody full access to purchase anything with your card until it has expired. That's why credit card companies offer fraud protection. To do this, they have to charge huge fees which you indirectly pay as a customer.

I think it's a good idea to have people's email addresses linked to their account so you can contact them in case you have to send them notifications about downtimes or changes and things like that. And reminders to remind them of their subscription running out. Bitcoin does not support recurring payments.
But in theory you wouldn't even have to collect their email addresses. Of course you need to be able identify your customer in case they have a question about their account or if they want to change something about their subscription.
Bitcon provides a very elegant solution to this. To identify a customer you could have them sign the message (or a string you provide) using the private key of the Bitcoin wallet they made the payment with. And you could then verify the message against their Bitcoin address to make sure it's them. This way, your customer could communicate with you using a different email address each time and you could still be sure it's them.
Anonymity and authentication combined with Bitcoin! :) Woop woop!

shows real-time prices and the all-time-high per currency (over all
