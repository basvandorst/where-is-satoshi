By your tone I can tell you aren't interested in having a conversation about it so I'm not going to even try.  I will however say that your investments in bitcoin are not threatened by other cryptocurrencies.  You've got much bigger things to worry about I'm afraid.  Generally speaking alts aren't going away either, so maybe lighten up a little and think a bit more positively about how to work with them instead of just whining about them uselessly.

You'd think I shot his dog or something by the reaction I got.  Bit coin is great but there should be more than one cryptocurrency.  Consolidation to one is just as bad an idea as a single world currency.  Diverse ecologists are the strongest.

I love that you are looking into this.  If you weren't already aware, there are other crypto-currencies out there gaining in popularity, which have some advantages over bitcoin.  My favorite is Litecoin, lots of other redditors like Dogecoin.  These are ostensibly more secure currencies than bitcoin, and are more accessible to your average consumer-grade mining rigs.  As a charity I don't know if you would be barred from mining your own coins, but if not it might be another thing you could look into.

You may want to ease up on the assumptions as well.  As you may note if you re-read my comment, I was also promoting litecoin.  I too think dogecoin is silly, but I did mention that others like it (ie: not me).  I simply stated the fact and you read into it.  Just by subscriber numbers of the various subreddits, is twice as large as and more than half as large as I wasn't trying to imply anything more than that.
