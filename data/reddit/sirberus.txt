Likely true, however, the real question is, "Is every person running a custom bot?" If so, then sure... they will likely be able to deal with changes pretty efficiently.
But I'm willing to bet that there is a % who paid someone else to make their bot for them, and **any changes** that undermine that automation will cause issues for them, and those issues can help dictate later changes.
At the end of the day, you ask yourself "What percentage of users will be stopped, in some aspect, by a captcha?" If your answer is sincerely "0%," then sure, it's a waste. But if it's between 1% and 100%, then it's a simple question of ROI.
Scoffing at it completely without considering it is a no-no.
**EDIT:** Personal anecdote of why I don't scoff at ideas without considering ROI: At one of the larger networks I worked at, we grew large within a couple years and noticed an outbreak in userspam. It was a startup company, so there wasn't much budget to divert programmers' focus too much, so the solution I went with at first was moving the "submit message" button over. It resulted in a large drop in spam... like... jokingly more than we expected. The theory is that some of the "casual users" (or "resourceful/cheap" ones) were just using home computers and macro scripts to automate messaging/pasting/sending, and moving the button over caused their automated clicks to not work. 
Was it silly? Sure. Did they catch on fast? Of course. But it gave us the data to help better understand the proportion of users we could likely prevent with minimal incriments of resources. And that's how you start. Here, it's a captcha... sure, it's pretty useless if 100% of the bot runners are at-least mediocre... but even if it results in a 5% reduction, that helps plan out future moves... and it is a cheap way to test the water.

People are upvoting this -- so I'm assuming it's a good point... but for us laypeople, can you explain?
Realistically, people do "check" every bill they receive -- especially merchants. It may not be under a UV light, but there is more to it then that, such as the "feel" of a real piece of currency. Even a layperson can tell the difference between a real bill and something quickly printed from home, and I know merchants gain a habit of rubbing their finger over parts of the bill with security features. It's not 100%, but it's a quick way to screen money coming in.
**With that said...** what would be required for someone to "forge" a bitcoin transaction? Because your analogy seems to put the prevalence of forged bitcoins at the same rarity as forged currency (which is why merchants can "risk" not using a UV light)... and if that's so, that's awesome. But if the barriers are relatively low to forge a bitcoin transaction, then it is destined to happen as it gains popularity.
Like I said though -- I'm not too savvy with bitcoin, so I'm interested in learning more about how this might play out.

Interesting. My immediate thoughts on what I'd need to find out to even address this:
* Do capital gains taxes apply to other currency traders? 
* Do capital gains apply where the driving force of value is an exchange rate (i.e. do people who hold gold have to pay capital gains on the appreciation in value of gold?)
And, most importantly:
* How does the government currently classify BitCoins. If it is an official currency (which I am 99% sure it is not), then I'm sure a whole bunch of regulations apply... but if it is essentially bartering, then what other rules come into play? For example, my Mom owns a ton of Beanie Babies. If for some reason they went back to being worth something and someone was willing to accept them straight-up for a laptop, how does the IRS view such an exchange?

This is a common misconception. While benefits of packet routing was touted as being a result of war strategy/design, it was actually simply a result of early networks being generally flaky.

Likely. But my point is valid nonetheless. I often see posts re: bitcoin where bitcoin supporters are somewhat offended at the idea that bitcoin isn't it's own currency and its value only stems from being converted into "real money" aka "USD."
Here, credit cards were attempting to establish that very idea which bitcoin supporters reject, which is "It's still USD." Applying this to bitcoin accepts that bitcoins are merely a transactional option that ultimately leads to "real money."

I'm just grabbing [quick numbers here]( but including mobile internet users, even a country like the United States or even Japan have &lt; 80% penetration. 
So poor people, homeless people, and *every* person within a country with a standard currency will have equal access/ability to access standard currency... yet because bitcoin requires things like (1) infrastructure, (2) internet, (3) luxury items... it will **never** have 100% penetration. So how can it compete with/replace common currencies?
I know that it isn't impossible to get people into it, and agree with your example re: Africa... but that's because I agree that it is possible to have spot-luxuries/innovations, which bitcoin is to me. But to make it a legitimate standard? I don't see how that is feasible...


Sure thing. First: It may not apply to you or many bitcoin advocates, but some of the more hardcore of the bunch seem to tout it as an investment for when the US dollar, or Euro fail... or if the government fails/etc. Like -- they look at Cyprus and extrapolate it to the United States or some big economic power... but if Cyprus' situation were to really happen to the United States or Europe, how will the bitcoin possibly survive? 
Like, I can see the bitcoin surviving a lot of harships... but if the actual *worst case scenarios* occur, then tangible money will be what buys goods, not money that requires (1) infrastructure, (2) internet, (3) luxury items. Right?
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:58:38
You don't seem to be the type of bitcoin user I'm talking about. In terms of an intermediary currency, or mechanism to allow for online payments/etc, I think bitcoin is great... but I'm talking about the people who tout bitcoin as a currency that is as legitimate as, say, USD or GBP, etc. People who talk about how employees should be paid in bitcoin, and countries should make it their currency, etc.
To those people, bitcoin is more than just a mastercard/visa/paypal alternative... and I'm curious how they feel bitcoin can overcome the barriers of population penetration.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:58:57
This isn't at all what happened here, and is actually the opposite of what you seem to be hoping it means.
Had the judge forced them to pay in USD, then *that* would have been significant, because it would have been a precedent of placing some sort of valuation on the good. By forcing the person to essentially return the bitcoins, it is basically the same outcome that would happen for any type of specialized good (which is so unique/odd in and of itself that there is no opportunity to "cure" the problem with anything other than providing the good itself).
In other words, if you make some sort of deal for a specific type of widget -- and only that type of widget will do -- then it is not abnormal at all for a court to force the seller to provide the "benefit of the bargain" to the purchaser.
tl;dr: Nothing special happened here.

**2 months ago** [you posted]( that you had about 6896 coins when they were just at the upswing of their price jump (you valued them at $170k... which puts them right at about $25, which means you held on to the lot of them it seems). Now you say you have about 5500 coins. So in 2 months time, you have sold/used upwards of 1396 coins
Assuming you didn't spend them at either the lowest or highest point of their USD value... at, say, $50 a pop you purchased around $70,000 in goods in the past 2 months.
Curious, but what have you bought in bitcoin? I mean, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you really "have yet to sell a single coin," but damned if I'm not curious what you purchased with that chunk of change if it wasn't a cash out.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:26:51
I guess I don't just mean afford them monetarily... it is the whole process. I'm the type of person who will immerse themselves into something like Bitcoin and not jump in until I really have a firm understanding of everything from how to get them to how to convert them back to USD, etc...
And, realistically, I just haven't had time with school. The other day I thought about buying one before the Senate held its discussion because I knew it'd give it a bump (didn't expect it to be THAT big of a bump), but I know if I bought one I would be spending more time checking its value/fluctuations than studying for my 5 midterms that start next week lol.
One day I'll buy some... but it looks like I now officially one some, as tipped me $10 in it via my other thread. When I check it, I see I have $11 and change... which must be from an old tip I received (and forgot about). At the time, it was worth like $0.05... now its up to a buck+ lol. Crazy.
But yeah, I can't even begin to figure out what I can do with that $11 in bitcoins until after finals.

@_date: 2013-04-30 06:44:44
I understand that part -- but the question  was in regards to a bitcoin-based note (paper currency). Bitcoin's robust anti-counterfeiting methods are useless until a transaction is submitted into the network for processing. 
I have family in rural parts of America with little to no cell service and dial-up only... How could i prevent being ripped off if I accepted  a paper note bitcoin?
Heck... I live right outside Los Angeles and there are large spots of deadzone where there isn't cell service for blocks. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:33:13
There's an important, distinct reason for this though. If you have millions of dollars held at a bank, that bank is making money off that money. You are a different type of customer and will receive different types of luxuries/benefits.
The less money you have in a  bank, the less money the bank earns by doing business with you, which means it has to cover its costs more creatively, like with fees.
Here, sending money through a bank means that no money is held re: that transaction. You could choose to put cash in an envelope and risk sending it to whoever you want in the world for the price of a stamp -- but instead, you want to use Western Union. So they charge a fee for this service. Not because you're poor, but because it would be ridiculous to expect them to work for free.

Yes, but it's significantly more difficult to bypass a captcha than it is to bypass not-a-captcha.  
It can be a simple barrier that separates casual opportunists vs. people who are an actual problem. 
Source: I developed security architecture for social networking websites to mitigate bots. Some of the most "worthless" barriers can significantly decrease script-kiddy participation. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:18:15
Now you're just arguing semantics. As far as what we are talking about is concerned, so-long as there is no monopoly/oligopolies at play, then it is still within the realm of a free (or "even") market.
Assuming the UK is similar to the US where there are many vendors of ATM machines, then entry-barriers/regulatory burdens/resources are just matters of costs... costs which are factored into the pricing structure of those vendor fees.
So the fact that "not just anyone" can provide an ATM service is immaterial to the issue so-long as the barriers in place are not absolutely restrictive on the number of players in the market. In other words: If the profit margins are outrageous enough to either (a) encourage anyone to gather the resources to enter the market, or (b) incentivize a current competitor to intrude in that space -- it'll happen. If it **can't happen** due to some sort of corruption/monopoly/oligopoly, no matter how fertile the opportunity -- then we've officially left the world of "market theory."
An example of that would be ISPs in the United States. They are effectively an oligopoly, and due to restrictive agreements/regulations, it goes well beyond a lack of capital preventing competitors from sprouting up.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:14:26
That's the point though -- you weren't the people who we were initially trying to deal with. Everything has an ROI, and though you'll never get to 100% prevention, the cost to increase 10% or so can be negligible.
I also designed bots to bypass security features, and the second a website put in, say, a captcha -- suddenly I had to ask myself, "Is it worth my time?" And it is at that moment that people like myself move on to a different network with less resistance. 
Those who power-through it are like a natural disaster, where you have plans in order for its occurrence, but you accept the fact that you can never prevent it.
So the reality is that if Mt.Gox implemented a captcha, those who are using bots will have to deal with that captcha. Might 100% of them do so at ease? Possibly. But in my experience, there is some portion of the bot-using-population that exist as more "casual users" who will be unable/willing/wanting to add captcha-mitigation to the bots they are using (maybe they didn't develop them on their own, so now they have to get their programmer to upgrade it, etc.) and messing with that X% is usually worth it.
Granted, given the nature of bitcoin's audience, perhaps there is a smaller fraction of those casual users... but at the cost of implementing the system to see its affect? I don't see a down side. Right now, it appears to be an open market across the spectrum of users with few barriers to prevent abuse. I say add one.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:45:36

Some are, but they are also tangible. I can walk up to any person anywhere in the country and give them USD, and they can immediately accept it and, without any additional steps/resources/requirements, spend that USD. Can bitcoin ever do this? Because this is an important aspect of currency.


But they are... there are many without access. Even telephones fall short of 100% penetration in a modern world.


I don't mean apocalypse so much as I mean Great Depression style collapse... or even war-sparked collapse, a la Iraq, etc. In those cases, paper currency and gold, though obviously hindered, are more useful than a digital currency dependent on functioning infrastructure, electronics, etc, are they not?
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:36:56
And you base your claim on... ?
I'm failing to understand why people who presently use/create botnets would not already be motivated to strengthen and grow them.
Perhaps this provides a new use for botnets, but incentive to focus more resources into them above what is already invested? Seems negligible at best. 
**EDIT:** Just to quantify my skepticism a bit... botnet spammers are known to make [thousands of dollars per day]( and some of the bigger botnets earn their masters [millions of dollars per month]( Not only that, but the opportunities for people who own a botnet are [diverse and plentiful](
In each of these occasions, the botnet creator is making actual, usable currency. 
With that said -- your theory is that the ability to shift those resources, currently making money, towards mining bitcoins will cause an increase in botnets? I just don't see that being realistic. I can't imagine anyone who isn't already attempting to grow their botnet for any of the other many reasons has been waiting for bitcoins to come around to think, "Oh! **NOW** I can make money!"
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:03:03
Re: Cell-phones, I addressed that [above]( The tl;dr is that the numbers already include cell phone users, and it is unrealistic to ever believe that 100% of a population will have access to the internet as they do currency. Even at 99% penetration, those in the 1% would face economic hardship from an inability to participate. Then at 100%, an issue comes re: redundancies required for power consumption and risks associated with such collapse. Even telephones do not have a 100% penetration rate in today's world. 
Re: Luxuries -- basically yes. The internet requires a lot of stuff to exist, then on top of that you layer a currency... and despite all of Bitcoins pluses, securities, and protections... its vulnerability relies on the fact that it is dependent on intangible luxuries.

No one is talking about stopping automated trading... only mitigating it. And Captchas would do that very well.

It's not extortion. You're comparing apples and oranges here. 
As someone else pointed out, it has to do with convenience. **You** forgot to bring cash to a place that **you** apparently need it. So you may get it from these ATMs, and they charge a fee in order to pay overhead and make a profit. 
But it's even more than that. Unlike a bitcoin ATM which holds no capital within itself, fiat ATMs will hold upwards of $20,000 in cash (some even more). Cash doesn't make money just sitting around, so an ATM operator chooses to forgo loaning that money out or making use of it in other ways in exchange for letting it sit in a machine and go stale, accruing no interest or additional value. The only way to make it worth the opportunity cost is to charge a premium on those who use it.

The judge basically said, "The Plaintiff is owed the benefit of their bargain." which means that they are owed the 8,000 bitcoins they purchased.
Where they get those bitcoins doesn't matter... whether it is from Coinbase, or if it is from Coinbase purchasing them at today's market rate and giving them to the plantiff, or if Coinbase calls up the plaintiff and goes, "Hey, I'll give you the money to buy them yourself at today's market rate."
The only issue with the last one is that, due to the complexities/fees/time/resources associated with that sort of transaction, it would be somewhat of a burden on plaintiff to make them buy bitcoins, assuming they wanted them... because cashing out at the rate *right now* may not buy 8,000 coins (or be worth the value of 8,000 coins) by the time the plaintiff can get it all invested.

First off: I'm somewhat of a bitcoin critic (check my past posts), but I have a lot of respect for what is it is, I am just too poor to participate in it at the moment.
With that said...
Why does bitcoin need to be "backed" by something?
Being "backed" by something is often a reference to some sort of precious metal, like gold -- but that's just because gold is a finite, scarce resource which provides "value."
Bitcoin appears to mimic this scarcity factor by the nature of its architecture, which means it doesn't necessarily have to be "backed" by anything, just as gold doesn't necessarily have to be "backed" by anything.
I know what you're likely thinking, "But gold has inherent value, and other uses, and demand, etc." Correct, but none of that has to do with its value as a foundation for currency. For example, if alchemy were ever figured out, then the value of gold would be destabilized -- just as if the encryption were cracked for BitCoins, it could also destabilize. For now, though, bitcoins are as close to intangible gold as it comes. Assuming the world doesn't fall into a technological apocalypse, then the Internet provides a convenient way for the currency to exist.
Now, as for your other point re: "it was artificially created, in very large amounts, by early adopters who now control over half a billion worth of it."
This is, again, a somewhat meaningless point. Early adopters didn't "artificially create" their coins, they simply earned them more easily due to them being the first group of people to start mining. Likening it to gold once more, this is like saying that present governments/individuals which hold large quantities of gold, which were likely captured quite a while ago through not-so-nice ways, have an unfair advantage.
There's nothing artificial about taking advantage of an opportunity to hoard as much of a finite resource as you can before others get a chance. So long as everyone is operating within the same universe of law (re: gold, no alchemy; re: bitcoins, no hacking/cracking/creating bitcoins outside the system), then all is fair at the end of the day.
If those who are hoarding bitcoins, just as those who hoard gold, decide to dump their coins and cash-out... though it may affect the market, it doesn't affect the integrity/scarcity of the bitcoin. If anything, it gives an opportunity for others to buy low and wait for it to fluctuate up again.
Overall, though, the only threat to bitcoin is some sort of alchemy hack which undermines its decentralized scarcity. So-long as that doesn't come into fruition, then its viability as a legitimate currency is legitimate and need not be backed by anything more than access to the Internet.

I don't think you were saying it was illegal -- but you definitely seemed to put out the vibe ("extortion") that it was somehow wrong. And no, you don't have to like it... but calling it extortion is a bit dramatic.
The same places that will charge me $3 for access to cash are the same that will charge $2 for a bottle of water or some other commodity/product. I may not like having to pay so much money for water, but the fact is that I didn't bring my own (no matter how much cheaper it will be) and I'm paying for the convenience. 
I'm a free market guy, though. If £1.75 is so substantially unjustifiable that it boggles the mind as to how anyone could possibly charge that much for access to cash, then it infers that the underlying margins are exceptionally high, which means it is a prime sector for competition to undercut it. Same goes for the £5 machines. So a better question is "Why isn't anyone competing with these?" If the answer is "not enough margin" or "not enough incentive," then you should appreciate the fact that you have the convenience of the machine at all.
