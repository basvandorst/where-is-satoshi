I'd give you 2 thumbs up if I could.

Its unfortunate that we're both getting thumbs down considering the fundamentals of bitcoin that I believe in.

I agree with the first part, it has no real use as a payment system, a store of value or anything else. Just the name. People might say in the future that they used Bitcoin to pay for something but they actually used Bitcoincash. l also doubt that people will be stupid enough to blindly invest in BTC to pump the price up to that degree. Why would you do that when you can invest in something that you can actually use and not just 'hodl' in hopes that some other suckers will do the same so you can cash out lol. More like a sitting duck than a pig.

Your pet roach is smart enough to run and hide when the spotlight is on him. CSW not so much.

I have no problems with reading your thesis that formed your conclusion on this. Have you posted it anywhere?

If you ask the average person if they've heard of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology, they usually will say "you mean Bitcoin?" Unfortunately there will be a lot more uninformed investors that will end up in this pitfall. Bitcoin core has no real use because of its block size. It never will scale to support mass adoption. Transaction expenses are through the roof and cannot complete fast enough. The lightning network is another step that complicates transactions and is also flawed. 
Yes it was the first of its kind but so was the model T. That car won't get you anywhere today but if you hodled it, yes its still worth something to someone. 
My problem is with the people in these subs who couldn't care less about the technology itself and the potential it has on freeing the world from the currently corrupt financial system. All they do is talk about price predictions, Lambos, Mooning and silly memes. Tell the people the truth, in the future bitcoin core will be a collectable at best.

When you go to the circus expect to see clowns. Lots of clowns. Bitcoin core is like an anchor holding back the progression of the future financial system- a scalable, useable, peer to peer electronic cash system. Just a matter of time boys.

It costs money to put you through the courts and then keep you incarcerated. A fine would generate revenue. Besides that whatever your buying with it once its illegal would be more likely what gets you sent to jail.

The B.C. government are experts in money laundering. They've turned a blind eye for years as money was laundered through real estate and casinos. Due to the amount of undeniable evidence against them, they have to make it look like they're making an effort to stop it.

Let's say the U.S. gov made bitcoin illegal. It would be more likely that they'd slap a fine on you than send you to jail. Why would they cost themselves money when they can make money.

Its hard to beat an exchange that you can physically walk into, get verified and buy crypto within an hour. Not to mention a phone number to call for support.

Fast forward to 2020 and the headline will read:
'John McAfee and Crypto traveler admit 1 million dollar bitcoin prediction was actually for another dimension'.

Great advise here. If it costs too much to get from point A to point B try riding your bicycle instead of driving. It might take 4 times longer to get there but it will save you money.
