This natural evolution will eventually make crypto ready for mainstream , even offered by banks. real mass adaption in my opinion

Hope they fix the vulnerabilities in the new device and old devices, otherwise there is no point having one.

Funny to see mad fans with blind faith.

1. not really. firmware update will do.
2. this is common
3. possible in many occasions
4. False statement. Ledger themselves said "We regret that the researchers did not follow the standard security principles outlined in Ledger’s Bounty program.". 
I am having hard time understanding where your confidence came from.

My mom quit trying Ledger after 5 minutes. I got her CoolWallet as 2nd attempt, and it works for her!

I agreed with you. It's the Twitter culture not the Bitcoin culture there.

If you use/trade crypto often, I suggest you get a CoolWallet S. Fast, easy, and secure. If you plan to hodl and never touch your crypto for a long while, go for Trezor. Just not hot wallets..  a friend of mine lost millions USD worth of BTC from his hot wallet..
