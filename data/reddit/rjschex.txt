If you want to get to the bottom of this issue, please check out the facts yourself. I think the 'evidence' on this link to Bitcointalk.org is fabricated. 
Someone claimed they could 'see' three chains. Someone thought it would be unlikely that three chains would occur after a hard fork.

TL:DR Here are the two concluding paragraphs:
"Speculators buy bitcoins the same reason they buy any fad — because the price has gone up. It's what happens after that stops that's likely to set the real value of bitcoins over the long term. That's the moment they'll become a currency, not a commodity. And there's enough evidence to think that might be happening now."
"Ultimately, "bitcoiniacs" aren't fazed by the recent headlines and are confident their cryptocurrency is here to stay. "Like anything else you need to be careful where you're storing your money, but to me it's the equivalent to having gold bars in your basement," Novak says."

Quote from the atrticle"
"Second, suppose that we would like to copy/mimic the Bitcoin blockchain approach backed by a fiat currency, or that its money supply can be regulated. Presumably the banks themselves would like to inject cash on by demand into the system. This means that we now abandon one of the most fundamental aspects of Bitcoin; the deterministic finite money supply. Unfortunately for the banks, this is impossible, because it will break the whole system by bypassing the very first requirement; violating the principle of single point of failure."

Much of their revenue come fom selling items to players during the games. With much lower transactions fees with bitcion they will be able to lower their prices and greatly increase the number of sales. 
Back when you had to place an order to buy a stock through a broker over the phone, it cost at leest $30. Large trades could easilly cost $100 or more. Trading fees are so low now, people daytrade, which was unheard of before 1985.

Given the relatively small number of busineswes that now accept bitcions, i think it is more significant if you do something that actually makes bitcions more useful to the community. This would not inculde making a small purchase from a retail business that is already taking bitions. i think setting up a ongoing transaction like using bitcions to pay for hosting of your website or renting the space for your business is more significant. Other significant uses would be sending an international money payment. 
How you acquired the bitcions is also important to the ecosystem. Are you mining. are you being paid for your work using bitcions. Are you selling soemthing.

Transactions are permanently recorded in an online open ledger and conducted in full view of the public, but consumers are empowered to decide how much of their personal information is passed along with each transaction.

IMO the main long term problem with Bitcoin is that its ultimate fate is in the hands of the majority of its miners rather than the majority of the people who own the coins. The minters will not make changes in the protocal that they view as being not in their best interest; even though, the change may be in the best interest of the majority of the owners of the coins.  
Proof of Work cryptocoins are those that are controled by their miners. Those coins that are 100% Proof of Stake are controled by the majority of those owners that particopate in maintaining their blockchains. Such coins exist. They are the ones that will be most reflective of the long term wellbeing of their active owners. 
I am not promoting any particular 100% Proof of Stake coin here. The one that may ultimately replace bitcon may not have been created yet.

The different disciplins of science are suppsed to be able to explin what is observable in the real world. 
When something new is observed in one of the deciplins, the theories that were develoed for it may have to be changed. 
The problem that many economists face is that what they observe in the bitcoin ecosystem does not fit their pet theory. This means that, if economics is the science that explains economic systems, the theory has to be revised. 
Physics in the nineteenth centry could be explained by the laws defined by Isaac Newtonl around 1725. 
Albert Eiinstein in 1995 found something that could not be explained by Newton's laws (e = mc squared).

The marketplace does not “need” bitcoin. However, the economy is more efficient where bitcoins can be used in place of credit cards especially in closed payment loops where there are no transitions fees in and out of fiat. This is why Overstock.com is trying to find vendors who will accept bitcoins. Anyone with a business who would like to become a vendor for Overstock is going to consider the bitcoin option. Some are going to succeed in becoming a vendor and some current vendors are going to adopt it in order to preserve the relationship. I think the CEO of Overstock has made that very clear to any of its vendors who have their ears to the ground. 
There will probably be more and more closed loop payment networks developing in places like San Francisco and Austin where there are already many places accepting bitcoins. 
The IRS is well aware of the underground economy that is based on cash. There is no way that Congress can fund the IRS to adequately control the underground cash economy. Do you think small businesses that accept bitcoins are going to report all of their bitcoin income that they receive that they do not get a 1099 or equivalent for? Why do you think some people want to keep bitcoin transaction anonymous?

If you watch the BCT price on Huobi on BitcioWisdom, that's exactly what it looks like IMO.  
I keep a Firefox version on my desktop 24/7 with tabs for BTC on Bitstamp, Bitfindex, OKCoin, and Huobi. I also have a BTC-e tab for Peercoin, Namecoin, and Litecoin. That is how I keep up with Bitcion's as well as Peercoin's, Namecoin's, and Litecoin's price movements. 
When there is a big move you can see it propogate from one exchange to another and from one coin to another. If there is a move in BTC on one exchange that is not reflected on the other, you know it is more likely to be reversed.

When there is a big move, the volume picks up on all exchanges. When the volume begins to taper off on Houbi, that is usually a sign the the move is over.

A better way to support the market is to start a service or business that accepts bitcions. The bitcoin economy needs to develop closed loops where bitcions are transfered from business to business without going in and out of fiat with the concomitant fees. As an alternative, you need to find ways to use bitcoins in transactions that are cheaper to do than the fiat altenative. Otherwise bitcoin will be just a fad.

I did not deliberately try to interpret what happened. However, I see that I implied that one person was doing the buying in sprits during the first two minutes, which may not be correct.  
I did not consider/know that short selling was allowed on Gox. After thinking about it some more, it may be that someone may have pulled off a classic short sale squeeze on a modern e-exchange. They could have just made the first couple of major buys, which led to the first major short seller covering his/her position. Once this got started, the other major short sellers would not have taken the time to try to find out want caused the buying. After two minutes, all of the panic was over or enough people had found out that there was no new news, and they began selling. This resulted in the ten minutes of wild swings before the market began to settle back down.      
If this is what happened, we’ll never know if he person who started this made any money or not.

The viability of Proof of Stake coins will not be determined in ivory towers. it will be determine in crypto space. There are currently two 100 % PoS  coins in the top 10, NXT and Blackcoin. 
Peercoin was the first to introduce the concept of PoS. However, Peercoin is still in its hybrid PoW/PoS period.  
NXT never was PoW. Instead, Investors bought premined coins with bitcoins. 
Blackcoin has a well publicized one week PoW period after which it became 100 % PoS.  Blackcoin' the green coin.

I was watching Gox on BitcoinWisdom when it happened. Someone started buying in big chunks every few seconds. One of the posts on this thread says they bought 4400 BTC. The buying was all over in 2 minutes. 
The price went from $370 to $540 during those two minutes. Then, there were some wild swings for about 10 minutes before the Gox market began to settle back down to around $380 in the next 10 minutes.  
If they bought 4400 at an average price of $455 (that is the average of 370 and 450), it cost them $2.00 million. If they can eventually sell them at $650, about the average now on Bitstamp and BCT-e, they will get $2.86 million for a 43 percent profit.   
All of the other markets I was watching on BitcoinWisdom moved up slightly in the first 5 to 10 minutes of the event.

Weather all cryorot eventually bits the dust or now, Satoshi already has a place in economic history right besides tulip mania, John Law, Jay Gould, and Maybard Keynes. 
Note that somneone using the pseudoname of John Law writes a column on Coindesk every Friday. The real John Law was a Scottish gambler who befriended one of the illigitamate sons of Louis XVI and created the Mississippi Company that led to the colonization of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Ilinios. This endevour eventually went bakcrupt and took the government of France with it around 1720. This was one of the precursor events that led to the French Rrevolution 70 years later. .  
Jay Goule was a nineteenth century US Robber Barron who is famous for the saying: He who sells'what isn't hisn, must pay it back or go to prison." refeering to the practice of selling short, which he was famous for. 
Keynes is, of ourse, crearted of Keynesian economics, which is the theory underlying central bank policy today.

One thing that is listed on the impossible to change list is to cover from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. As you will see on the list, this is the only one on the list where some people see a need to change. 
However, the miners would have to accept this and they never will becasue their investment in their equipment will have no value in the bitcion system. They would then be forcced to mine altcoins that still use Proof of Work. 
Proof of Work requires a lot of electricity.  Some people think 100% Proof of Stake altcoins will supplant bitcion before the miners will give in.

First: Someone or some group of three people or less must invent something that becomes widely accepted in the field. The focus in on an invention; it is not based on whether it was proposed in an academic paper. Clearly, the real Satoshi invented the blockchain. To qualify for a Nobel, a crypto based on the blockchain must become widely accepted as a world currency.

Mastercoin is definitely not a replacement. Unlike Likecoin, Peercoin, and others that have their own blockchain. Mastercoin actually runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Neither Litecoin nor Peercoin are intended to replace Bitcion. Liitecoin is conceived of as silver to bitcoin's gold, while Peercoin is intended as a savings account currency as opposed to Bitcoin's medium of exchange currenty. 
Etherium and NXT were conceived of as 2nd generation cryptocurrencies that have tried to incorporated the best propetrties of Bitcoin, Peercoin, Mastercoin, and Namecoin.

The second one is a whale buying or selling. Thiis can be observe on BitcoinWisdon. The unexperienced ones will throw a lot of money or coins on the market within a one minute interval. It is quite obvouious when it happens.

The primary dev, Baldur, is very competent. 
The main theory about him so far is that he is a wealthy Icelander who wants a way to move his wealth outside of Iceland. However, he cannot do that because of the currency controls imposed by the government 5 years ago that were supposed to be temporary. 
He appears to be able to write competent Icelandic. He is using knowledge of local Icelandic institutions to ensure that the AirDrop is conducted fairly. There have been very few claims that other people have stolen their coins due to others by the AirDrop. He has apparently defeated all hacker attempts to steal coins. However, it is apparently possible for acquaintances or relatives to steal coins.  
He has posted links to local Icelandic media outlets that are probably only available to people there. 
The small Icelandic crypto community apparently does not know him and is hostile to his project. However, the two leaders of that community apparently have  conflict of interest on the subject. They re quite open about the conflict of interest. They have not brought their cause to the Auroracoin Forum. They may be the ones who may most profit by what is being attempted here. There is not enough information on who they are and what they are tryring to do to really know this.

To some extent Wall Street is already too late. The New York Stock Exchange waa too late adapting to the Internet. NASDAQ flourished. The last NYSE seat sold for $300,000 (or something like that). Now the seats are worthless. 
Look at how successful companies like Blockchain.com, Coinbase, and BitPay are. They have not gone through an IPO. I understand an IPOs costs around $1.5 million. Think what a crypto startup organized by some tech savy people can do with $1.5. The Silocon Valley VC are supplanting Wall Street on cryptos. 
Stocks are going to be registered and sold on the blockchain. Why do you think Namecoin, Mastercoin, NXT, and Etherium have such market caps? Will one of these or Bitcoin replace the NYSE and NASDAQ?

I think its energy consumption and its control by its mining community are Bitcoin’s Achilles heel. 
It is my understanding that Litecoin’s requires less energy to operated when compared apples to apples to Bitcoin. 
Peercoin’s claim to fame is that it requires less energy and is more in the control of its stakeholders. However, Peercoin is not completely 100 percent Proof of Stake. 
NXT is 100 percent Proof of Stake. When NXT is scaled to the transaction velocity of Bitcoin today, it should still be possible to forge blocks on a normal desktop used simultaneously for other purposes. Since NXT does not have a Proof of Work component, there are no miners involved. Its blocks are forged by its stakeholders. Thus, all upgrades to the protocol’s software are completely in the control of the majority of the public node owners. The Bitcoin miners control its upgrades. 
Here is the current list viewed in terms of market cap; Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin, Peercoin, Dogecoin, and NXT. 
Thus, if you want to know what might replace Bitcoin in the future, that is what the market is saying, and I am just reporting on what I think it means.

Although the US Rederal Reservew as craeted in 1909, Nixon did not take the US off of the gold standard until 1971 to wage the Vietnam war. Up until that time you could redeam your dollars for gold, and you could convert your pounds, franks, liras into dollars and then gold.

Ruobi leads in reported volum. It has always had a maker taker fee system. BTChina had high fees. As soon as BTChina went to a maker taker fee system, thier volume picked up drastically. 
In a maker taker system, those who placel limit orders onto the order book, receive a fee instead of paying one. That explains the high volume. Whether any exchange once padded theri volume, I do not care. If they initiate market moves, I am going to watdh them.

You need to know some background. 
Huobi has the highest voume. It has a maker taker fee system. 
BTChina just went to a maker taker system and their volume has significantly increased. 
It you place an order on the BTChina orderbook and it is matched, you get the price plus an 0.001 percent bonus for adding liquity. The person on the other side of the transactioon pays an 0.003 percent fee, which pays the bonus to the person who placed the order on the book and the exchange gets to keep other 0.002 percent as its fee.  
I recently heard that one other exchane has gone to a maker trake fee system, but I do not remember which. 
You can see how providing a bonus to those adding liquity to an exchane will atract traders who will place orders on the book. This will increse their volume 
I think all exchanges will sortly have to go to maker taker fee system because of Huobi's and BTChina's success with it

If someone will verify what I am saying, this thread needs to be downvoted.

The Silocone Valley VCs seee cryptos as the next goldon goose, and the Cal legis want to ensure that the DC polaticians keep the Fed regulators from harming the goose. 
They want to avoid the type of thing that the Bank of Montreal just did.

I am not a miner, but I would think he would be better off as a long ranger. Mining pools have to communicate over the Internet, which would be somewhat slower than what he should be able to se up at his own location. .

The top 20 Russian oligarch have already moved their money outside of Russia where Putin cannot get at it. That is why they are still in the top 20. The Russian judicial systemis like pudey in Putin's hand.

Not Meh: 
Greece drops out of the Euro. 
Scotland separates from England, adopts BTC as its ccurrency.
Saudia Arabia drops the USD for oil payments, accepts bitcoin. There has been a chill lately between the Saudis and W. DC.

Implementing such an decentralized exchange is a high priority with NXT. NXT is a new altcoin that is 100% Proof of Stake. The decentralized exchange is due out this month; however, I have not been keeping up with it lately. its market cap has been falling so things may not be progressing as expected. 
Mastercoin may also have such a plan.

You seem pretty good at it. You could go into the vanity wallet business.

I agree that the question of the miner's control of cryptos is an issue that needs to be discussse. Poof of Stake coins provide an alternative to Proof of Work coins. 
I will probablw get downvoted becasue many into bitcoin do not want to hear anything about other altcoins that might replace bitcion, but the miner's issue may have to be faced in the future.

You obviously missed my point twice. If the day traders who are actually making living at it, are taking their clues from watching the sites that are still aledged to be padding their volume, then maybe they are not still padding theri volume. You cannot be a successful day trader and use false clues. 
I tried to daytrade back in the 1980 before the term daytrade was invented. Some peole have the intestional fortitude to do it and some don't. Nevertheles, I know that to be a successful daytrader, you have to be able to read the market better than the average trader.

Here is the link to the treaty that ended the Auroracoin War. 
You will find links to what each side agreed to. There was no 515% attack. 
A fix has finally been found to the time warp exploit attack, which has never been successfully used before. The attack that was in progress, has been called off. 
Here is a simple explanation of a time warp exploit attack:

Baldur Odinsson, the main AUR dev, is so unaware of this FUD campaign that is being conducted elsewhere than the Auroracoin Forum that he is trying to solve the problem caused by a company refusing to let their database to be used to verify eligibility until they get paid for each inquiry. 
Here is the link to the thread that was posted 18 hours after this crisis is supposed to have started. 
    
People really need to checkout the facts before they spread FUD.

This type of arrangement should not be called a close bitcoin loop. However, it will be an important part of a closed loop system. This should be called a closed bitcoin node where a closed node is defined as an enterprise that is operated in a way where its accounts receivable and payable are all transacted in bitcions. 
Thus, the bitcoin transaction network can be depicted as a network of nodes that receives and sends bitcion payments.
Technically, bitcoin is actually a closed loop system. A company like Coinbase receives bitcoins and spends bitcoins. The problem is that there is a second element to the transaction where they reciive and spend fiat.
