Well, in fact i'm from a 3rd world country, and i find easier for us to have savings than us people who have to pay for their debt and their own health bills, etc... and trust i'm not even a midle-class man, i'm like c class, i earn 3 minium wage, wich seems a lot ( and well compare to the most in my country its kinda is, cos a few have much...) But it's  like $753.00 ( in todays price os dolar here)... So... There's that
