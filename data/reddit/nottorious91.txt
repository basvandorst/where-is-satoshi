I think you should invest in some sort of bitcoin exchange / mining pool. Also, sell some and buy something nice just so you lose the urge to cash them all at once. Also, try and spread the word about bitcoin, even just by tipping small amounts to people on reddit/twitter. I would also invest a small sum into alternative crypto's like litecoin, you never know. Keep it smart and you will be okay ;)

You can also look at litecoin... it's the second in size, 84mil total cap, 2.5minute confirmation vs bitcoin's 10.. and only 4$ atm :D I have some just in case.... it will also be added to MtGox sometime soon

If u get pass the misspell in the title "bitcion" I thought it was a good read.

Will it crash now? Or just big investors speculating?

We're in a bubble / pyramid scheme... but we're just the early adopters... I wouldn't be surprised if it keeps on growing exponential.. check the all time log chart.
Buy as much as you can throw away now, sell half when price doubles in a week or so and ride the rest to 900+ ;)

Math 2013 - 1991 (from my username) is a bit more than 17, huh? :P

If you mean selling queues as in the time required for the BTC you (lets say mined) have in your local wallet to get into MtGox and be sold on the market (so that you now have usd on mtgox's website) there's no queue to my knowledge, it's just a standart BTC transfer. I might be wrong...

They don't have an ETA but there is a ticker api on their site
I bought mine on BTC-E.

Completed. Anything to help out a fellow bitcoiner. Congratz on choosing an more outside the box topic than most of your fellow students I presume. Don't forget to let us know how it went ;)

Some say it's silver to bitcoin's gold. I it's something like Euro/Dollar. Either way, it doesn't hurt to own a few litecoins when they are 4$/pop. You can check  (there are some technical differences)

Also want to know

IMHO a lot of people are just hearing of bitcoin and from that most need some days to get their head around it, another to decide to invest and another few good days to actually get the funds onto an exchange... all fueled by the regret of not getting in earlier makes them buy regardless of price... the early adopters hold most of the power and they aren't stupid enough to sell to much at once because it will get to hurt them overall.... 
TL:DR -&gt; greed + tedious process to buy -&gt; price keep on rising

I feel your pain... sad fistbump :(
