We do understand these cases where freelancers are working as digital nomads, which is partially why we built Kable Freelance in the first place! However, as a company we do need to make sure we are compliant with existing rules and regulations. We will always look at the individual situation at hand, and then decide whether we are able to serve the freelancer or not.

Yes, all correct! We checked it extensively with our lawyers, unfortunately it was not possible for us to make it happen without KYC for the freelancer / service provider.

You can redeem them immediately for BTC, and are free to transfer the coins wherever you want (you provide your wallet address). And we won't charge any fees for it.
There is nothing sad about it, really :)

Looking forward to what you come up with. Ask us your questions here!

What I don't get is why Gox doesn't arbitrage themselves. They could buy BTC on Bitstamp/coinbase on the cheap and sell it on their own platform. To obscure identity they could partner with a hedge fund (those guys love free cash).
They would 1) make a ton of money and 2) reduce the spread so it would look less like they have issues.

Met him at BTC London in July. Amazing guy!

Completely agree - still way better than no info at all. Would be very interesting to know the address/user ratio. Alternatively, you could start counting only addresses with &gt;1 BTC, etc. ...

As of Feb 2012:
        2 addresses have 6 or more figures (100,000 &lt;= x):
            105,258.88 12WmWuSQCgpEkPQTZ4ABijQaz6TCV69ZpE and
            105,555.00 1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a
       70 addresses have 5 figures (10,000 &lt;= x &lt; 100,000)
      740 addresses have 4 figures (1,000 &lt;= x &lt; 10,000)
    6,552 addresses have 3 figures (100 &lt;= x &lt; 1,000)
   66,118 addresses have 2 figures (10 &lt;= x &lt; 100)
   50,638 addresses have 1 figure (1 &lt;= x &lt; 10)
  459,006 addresses have a fraction (0 &lt; x &lt; 1)
2,411,568 addresses have 0 BTC
so ~600K in Feb 2012. Must be way (!!) more by now.

 Would love to have a tool which shows this figure constantly updated.
