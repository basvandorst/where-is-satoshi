Haha... [here ya go]( They're 50 mBTC each, I was going to give 'em $15 or $20 in Steam gift cards but I thought I'd do something a little different this time.

Well really, we just put a couple dozen spiders (some use tent caterpillars because of the quick coverage, but I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas) in there around the second week of December and let them do their thing for a few weeks.

I'm actually living in Canada, but my dad still works over there. From what he's told me, I don't think adoption of Bitcoin is any bigger than it has been in the past... mostly because Internet culture at large isn't as pervasive there, also it's pretty easy to get US dollars &amp; Euro so I think most people have just been buying that as it's stable enough. I would like to see its use more in these situations. I know Russia is planning a ban sometime this year, but so far no such news from the Ukrainian government.

Well, Ukrainian Jesus was born in a spiderweb in 1329, in a village called Berezivka in the Western part of Ukraine historically known as Halychyna. Instead of gold, frankincense and myrrh, the Three Wise Men brought  sour cream, wheat, and sour cream.
