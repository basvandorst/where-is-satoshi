This guy is pretty exceptional, you should check out Stephen Livera's podcast where he interviews him.

I totally get it, my wife is in the same boat. I'm super passionate about Bitcoin, but she loves me and she's super forward thinking so I try to bring her in to my world as to try not to alienate her.

No this is bad because basically they are able to inflate how many bitcoins there are in the market without having ownership of said bitcoin,also no one is really auditing them to see how many bitcoins they really do own. It's really fucked up. They can say they have 100 bitcoins and sell 100 shares of that bitcoin but in reality they own 1 bitcoin.

It's just concerning because this central authority is able to take the scarcity aspect of bitcoin away, which is one of the many great features of bitcoin.

Very true

Has anyone listened to the Unconfirmed podcast about what ICE/Bakkt wants to do,  apparently they will sell shares of bitcoin that they don't own on Wall street. They want to sell more shares then there are bitcoins created.

Yeah and it's super dangerous for investors because they don't own the private keys to the bitcoin so if bitcoin decides to fork they don't own any of the new chain. So they essentially will own a piece of paper that's worth nothing. I have no idea how this is legal.
