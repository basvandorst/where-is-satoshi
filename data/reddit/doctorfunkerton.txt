Because no one would have thought Elon Musk is rich otherwise...

You really need an explanation for this?
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:19:11
It's kinda like Stockholm Syndrome
@_date: 2019-02-09 07:28:40
Don't buy any.
If you're interested in it, just learn about the technology and follow it. 
You can buy some later when you have money you can afford to lose

Lol DCAing properly

Drawing a line is technical analysis now?

Oh I interpreted that comment wrong.

About 10% of it.

Because it's not good as a currency. 
Posts like this op just seem desperate and delusional.
It's too volatile and no one wants to accept it +the infrastructure for a transaction is very inconvenient.
Why would I go through the hassle of buying with bitcoin when I have real money? Why would someone go through the hassle/risk of accepting bitcoin if they could receive money?
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:51:50
Lol why would you use bitcoin as currency?
Don't you have actual money? Bank accounts, credit cards, venmo,PayPal, etc? That are widely accepted and set up for that kind of thing?

So...does looking at charts this way work for trading any commodity?
(I'm not actually asking - I'm taking the piss out of your comment)
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:49:42
You're not OP and I agree with you.
I was questioning his choice to rely on graphs and trends to get a valuation. That's just guesswork.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:34:10
So why did you buy it at $7500 you retard
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:30:11
The fact that you think that anyone speaking against bitcoin is shill does not make you look any less delusional...
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:02:12
In the case of bitcoin, it's completely arbitrary though. 
Which makes the matter of fact statement that "3k is good but 3.5k is too risky" pretty silly and baseless

I first subscribed to keep tabs on bitcoin, but stayed to watch the crazies
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:58:39
This sub is so delusional that it's astounding.
Like even this post by OP...
It's like half support group and half trying to rally people to buy bitcoin.
