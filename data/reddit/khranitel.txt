Get rid of decimals.
Common people are just not accustomed of thinking in decimals, max acceptable is 2 digits after comma. They never think "0,52 Euro", they think "52 cents".
Do an experiment, tell a commoner that 1 Bitcoin cost is 500 Euro and then ask him how much is 0.0034 BTC. If If the answer will take him more than 5 seconds, that means he will struggle to use Bitcoin in its current state as a money.
It really shows that BTC is designed for non-human uses when we seeing numbers like 0,00725063 floating around.
Also, fully agree about addresses issue. Moreover, the whole concept of change addresses is insurmountable. Even the simple explanation of every address being a bill or coin isn't acceptable, because people by centuries are accustomed to denominations of a bill like 1, 2, 5, 10 and so on, not 1,6842374

Sorry, I'm confused. You must be talking about Ver, BU and r/btc, right?
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:36:56
Please get out of your pink ponies world already.
What are you saying would be true in a case when there were no external actors trying to influence Bitcoin ecosystem. Some of those actors could easily provide enough incentive to miners to cripple Bitcoin, and its price.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:12:47
Exactly what Ver and his chinese friends are doing right now: push untested and bug-filled software as Bitcoin main branch. BU isn't relevant, they're just convenient fools.
BTC price crash as a result of contentious fork would be a nice bonus which will drive its adaptation back tremendously.
Even if Bitcoin somehow will be able to survive this, the ability to increase block size unlimitedly will inevitably lead to the point when full nodes could only be hosted by government and corporate identities. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:19:46
Well, I could write a few paragraphs about each of logical (not even starting with economical) fallacies you fallen into with this piece, but I really don't see a point frankly speaking. 
I just hope you're right, and I'm wrong, and we aren't heading to Venezuela scenario full steam ahead.

[22 million, or 15% citizens of Russia are living below the poverty line]( "Below the poverty line" means that they have to live on less than living wage, thats 9691 rubles or about 160 USD. Per month.
[46% of people here has to grow food to feed themselves]( No, I'm not talking about villagers, I'm talking about people who live in cities, working full-time or retired. They're raising their crops on their 6 ares "haciendas" which was mostly given them for free by Soviet state just for this purpose.
Let that sink in for a moment.

Those balances you see are not even final ones, there will be a haircut which amount is still undecided.
Or actually this whole thing still could be the biggest trolling in the history of crypto. BTC-e already moved its goalposts from September 1st to September 15th, and some non-confirmed info suggests that they could continue with this tactic.

@_date: 2017-08-16 05:00:40


Живу я здесь. Since 1980 :)
Leave that "hatred bandwagon" rhetoric for your anti-mainstream bubble.


Then come to Russia and see for yourself. I can even arrange you a trip to my grandmother's family "hacienda". Or my mother's, your choice. Sorry, can't arrange your meeting with both my granddads and other grandmom, they're dead mostly because of lack of medical treatment available to them.
You're kinda right, not all of them need this because of malnutrition, only 15% (which is also stated in the article I gave you, if you even bothered to put it into google translate). That's just 22 million people, who needs them anyway. Others are doing this probably just for amusement, that's exactly what you need after 5 days spent at full-time work, right?


If you check our trade stats, you will find out that 55-80% of Russian exports are unrefined oil and natural gas. This was so since the Soviet Union times and still is. In 1999 (last year of Yeltsin presidency) oil price was $15/barrel, in 2008-2013 it was 120$ average, except 2009 shock, which just eradicated most of economic growth from previous few years (gasp, what a coincidence). No wonder this country made "unbelievable progress" just sitting on oil life support, even a monkey in president seat could make it happen. In fact, a monkey could do it better, because it wouldn't slipped my country wealth into the pockets of its friends, (former) colleagues and other "valuable people".
But then 2014 came and guess what? All this "unbelievable progress" made by our glorious leader magically started to vanish, because no one in government bothered to create something (or let people to create something without the risk of seizing by "valuable people") to ensure Russia's future when our natural resources will deplete or lose value. 
That's why your phrase about Russia "being run very well" is a spit to my face as a citizen of Russia, because you're praising people who steal my country's future. Those, who're doing their best to ensure that people of my country will never be among the wealthiest and happiest people of the world. Therefore, fuck you again.

This shit is FP? Really?
Remember, kids, if some media is speaking differently than your local evil-state-banksters-nazi-controlled channel, doesn't mean that it is good and truthful.
RT is lying. It is state-sponsored Ministry of Truth in its purest form. Its news, along with the news and "analytics" on every major TV channel here in Russia, are directly curated by president's administration. As the overwhelming majority of people here use TV as their major source of information, this effectively allows government to control what people in Russia knows and thinks.

I'm not saying about this particular situation, just about their general policy.
Regarding this one, there were no outright lie, just a "little misinformation", RT-style. Not frozen, closed in 30 days. But now they can come off for days bitching about how UK oppresses their "freedom". 
Sure, RT didn't like to get even the bleak shadow of treatment which foreign media and NGO gets in Russia on weekly basis.

The choice is yours. *"A man chooses, a slave obeys"* :)
There is no real difference between all of them really, except CNN/Fox has at least some degree of freedom in the way of how the present their info.
I prefer to not trust to any single source and use several of them to get the real picture from their contradicting info. All of them make mistakes that giving away their lies (such as RT unintentionally showing cluster bombs under the wings of bombers taking off from Hmeimim).
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:39:56
Nope. BBC is like kids play in sandbox compared to "Rossiya Segodnya" news agency, its subsidiaries and affiliates.
That recent Brexit referendum is the example of why. If BBC had even fraction of power RT has, such thing would be just unthinkable, like it is in Russia. Google "Federalization of Siberia" for one of examples.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:30:16
Bitwala is actually quite cheaper than others, mainly because they don't have any fees hidden in BTC exchange rate. Virtually any other card I checked has those.
1 eur/month fee, 0,5%/1 eur minimum top up is the best I saw. You're not paying currency exchange fee if you pay in euro. ATM withdrawal is quite pricey, but any card will have it unfortunately. At least its fixed, so I can withdraw large amounts without paying heaps of money.

AFAIK, 1 input = 1 bitcoin address, from which you're transacting. If you have 10 addresses with 0.1BTC each and you're sending transaction for 1BTC, that'll be transaction with 10 inputs.

And if you think that Trump is better than Clinton in president chair for the US and whole world, you're in for rude awakening. Good news would be that bitcoin prices will surely ease this unfortunate event for us. For some time ;)

UASF ≠ SegWit, it won't be activated immediately! It must be locked-in first, which just won't happen before November 15 because of lack of hash rate.
