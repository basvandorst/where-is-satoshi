2016, the production of bitcoin will usher in half, history tells us that whenever the output of bitcoin halved, the value of bitcoin will rise, the premise is that other conditions remain unchanged. Through the continued growth of the demand for bitcoin over the past five years, there is no reason to decline in demand for the next half after a significant decline. It may be more stable, and may continue to grow, but few people will predict that it will fall significantly, even those who are fanatical bitcoin opponents. Bitcoin has attracted a number of strong faith

I do not know whether this is a bitcoin BUG, but I really met it.
Usually we can find the confirmation details of the transaction in the  wallet address. But the Bitcoin-Qt client does not have a solution that is:
The backup wallet out, open the page:  Drag the wallet file to the middle of the box. if there is a wallet, the password will be prompted to enter the password to confirm the success, the site will prompt you to import the current wallet create an account and let you set a password, that actually creates an online wallet, client can't see the bitcoin can now see, and can transfer out. So now, back to the client, to create a new wallet address, from the site to the money to the new address on it, the client should soon be able to see.
Should pay attention to is, this created an online wallet account name is random sites to a string and difficult to remember, if you want to use online wallet, the best specialized register a, money would be transferred to other address after. This account is invalid. And site has your private key, or for the good.
