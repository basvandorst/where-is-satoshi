Thanks for all of the help guys. I'll definitely talk to Jeffrey Tucker, and there are a few other good suggestions as well.
If I have any general questions I'll ask in this subreddit; there are a lot of helpful people here.

The comments in this thread are disappointing. Perhaps you should post this over in @_date: 2014-02-28 03:39:16
True. I didn't really have expectations of professors even knowing what bitcoin was, I just didn't know any better way to find people with degrees in economics at the time.
Posting my questions here and getting responses would be good, and I will probably end up doing that.  The only reason why I am hesitant is because the idea behind the interview is to get the opinion of an "expert" on something.  In this format, anyone can answer even if they don't have a good background on basic economic concepts.

Also, if you have any good sources where questions like these have been answered, I would be interested in them as well.

Are you an econ student?  Someone studying econ would be fine too.  One of the professors actually put me into contact with a grad student who had written about bitcoin in the past.  We got to talking, but he couldn't arrange a meeting with me :(

It is impossible to tell who is behind a bitcoin address unless they say that they own that address.  It would require an outright statement.  If you buy something from someone, and you tell them your name then they know who you are and who the owner of the address that they received the payment from is.  If you don't, then they have no idea.
