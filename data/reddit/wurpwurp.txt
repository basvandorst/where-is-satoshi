I agree largely with the requires too much money has to enter the system point.  
In general right now id simplify most mining generated coins into 2 scenarios.
1)Mine, sell for dollars
2)Mine, buy product with mined coins, the seller then sells the bitcoins for money.
Until the bitcoin community reaches the point where it can be a closed system (meaning you don't necessarily have to convert to dollars because you can do almost just as many things with bitcoins) we still need that large influx of outside money.  Until that happens I can picture a scenario where people are gradually willing to accept less dollars in exchange for their relatively useless bitcoins

It would make sense for them to have a rather beefy security getup up now, but do they have the abilities to implement such a thing?

leave country fast to a country who wont give a shit about bitcoins for at least 5 years.  Slowly sell off and live like a king

maybe they don't remember them off the top of their head.  Is there a reason you can't use google?

What information? I don't think it is too hard to make your transactions too convoluted that people could say without a reasonable doubt that they have found you.  And even if they can place reasonable blame on you until governments recognize bitcoin theft as a crime i don't know if it would mean anything anyways. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 18:13:05
the people who use bitcoins is a small market.  Those who use silk road is much smaller.  But it is a good idea until they set up something else
@_date: 2011-06-30 04:12:37
Good chance you are right.  But it would be pretty easy to do it if they wanted to, it would just mean one less ivory back scratchier to cover the cost.  Actually they would probably just take the money out of a teaching kids to read program or something.

next will come online banking websites, credit cards, facebook.  It will take them years to reap all of the "reward" of this

Not everyone should be in the marketing business.  Some how i don't think my idea about how Hitler would love bitcoins is the right approach.

put your wallet.dat file on a usb stick and hide it under your pillow.  This file is the only thing you need to keep your coins.  It doesn't even have to be on your computer to receive coins, in fact its better not to have it on your computer unless you want to send coins. This way it is less likely people will be able to steal it.
Reload your wallet file from your usb stick and all the coins you had before you put it on the stick, and all coins sent to you after it was put on the stick will be accounted for.
Lose access to your wallet.dat file and you lose access to your coins.  They still exist, but no one can use them.

I suppose that could be a good use.  But for the time being it's easier just to give the gas station guy a couple 20s.  If they accepted bit coins directly through a just as fast as debt/ credit card transaction i'd be more willing, but my general philosophy is if it costs less than $100 and they take cash I pay in cash.  I only use debt/credit cards if I haven't been to the bank in awhile and my wallet is empty.  Its just my preference.
Ill bide my time, if i find I have more coins then i know what to do with ill sell them, or try things your way.

For any semi stable economy I would think it is safe to say inflation is below 6.5%
@_date: 2011-07-02 09:15:03
Yes, but if your currency is rapidly going to shit then the majority of the population has to buy in now.  Which means that people have to be willing to trade the currency currently going to shit for BTC which would be stupid. Plus the majority of I assume any country hasn't even heard of bitcoin let along understand how it works it at this point.  Maybe in the future everyone will have some but as I said its too soon.

This is the only logical reason I have heard.
Some people are just jerks and like screwing with people, another theory.

doesn't really matter.  GPU mining doesn't tax the CPU at all really, and CPU mining isnt worth it
@_date: 2011-07-08 03:28:47
It seems that anything relating to problems regarding traditional forms of currency is deemed to be acceptable here because it makes a possible  argument for the acceptance of bitcoins.
Personally I think it doesn't belong here (maybe in bitcoin politics?), but until i'm the boss my opinion is just my own.

It's unnecessarily powerful, but when I made my miner I decided might as well make it a good desktop that I can use to do other things as well.

Personally (with no real research done) I feel bitcoin is far far away from saving anything.  Unless the whole country only wants alpaca socks. 
 In 5-10+ maybe we can start talking about bitcoin making real changes.  Although hopefully sooner.

at one time the thought that electrons existed was held but there was no way to prove it

I think I would like to purchase one of these
@_date: 2011-07-09 18:24:44
I haven't looked into any of these myself, but there are a lot of sites that offer dollars for the same kind thing (filling out surveys or what have you)
Companies pay these sites money to get people to fill out surveys, most often for marketing research, these sites then get you to fill them out by paying you a small amount of money.

As my mom always told me when we were in a toy store and i was eager to spend my allowance "Don't buy something for the sake of buying something, make sure you want it "That applies to me right now with bitcoins.
95% of my spent money is in he form of food, booze, and gas.  I have expendable money, but there isn't anything i want right now.  Maybe a new graphics card or 2, but i doubt ill get a good deal on those paying in BTC.  I might be looking to buy some pants in the next couple months.
But in the mean time there is nothing that I want/ wouldn't be able to get cheaper using dollars, so I shall hoard.
@_date: 2011-07-09 18:12:40
Yes, but why not ask for dollars if you plan on exchanging it right away?  People have to pay the bills, something kind of tricky to do with bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-07-03 05:27:11
Will bitcoin sales be taxed and properly reported as revenue?  Well I guess no matter what the real answer is the smart thing to say is yes of course they will be.  I don't care on any moral/legal grounds just curious.
@_date: 2011-07-10 03:11:25
Dear God, time to get out of bitcoins before we all get labeled as crazy anarchist criminals.  I jest, but I am surprised that this is how some people view things.

bought a 5850 that will have paid itself off start of next week(including electricity) and bought 5 coins at 20 CND.  So as long as the price doesn't fall too much and difficulty predictions for next increase are accurate ill be even in about 2-3weeks
its been worth it for the excitement, no matter how much i make/ lose in the long run
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:03:14
I'm sure they make more than enough in fees to keep them happy.

The priced dropped a little, then a bunch of panicky people freaked out and are desperately trying to sell before the price hits 0.01 and never ever recovers.  
Those are their thoughts about the price not mine.
