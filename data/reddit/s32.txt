Yeah, I'm glad that I'm still able to withdraw my bitcoin from bitstamp, btc-e and other reputable markets. No big deal at all.

I have no idea how your website is any better than other petition sites. Hell, I hardly have any idea how your site works at all. The first thing you want is my email. I'm not giving you my email when it is statistically very likely that I'll never come back to your website. I also have little interest in a website emailing me at all when I just want to see their petitions. Maybe in the future I would (after creating/signing a petition), but to start it seems like there is no reason to have that barrier. What is your reasoning for doing so?

College student. Free account. They pay other banks ATM fees for me. I know that something like that wouldn't be reasonable in the bitcoin world, and that these guys are charging so much because they can. Regardless, my (and many others) reaction to a 7% fee to withdraw money is that it's lunacy. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:28:31


It is a *lot* when my bank let's me withdraw money from any ATM for *free*. Somewhat apples and oranges but this is how many consumers will see it.

Usually the systems of large companies like this are complex enough to require quite a ton of integration though 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:43:21
Yeah I get you 100%. My bank is making money off of me enough to warrant paying my ATM fees, so there is definitely an associated cost with it, whether indirect or not. To be fair, if I stored all of my btc in a "bank accoint" that somebody else could lend and had control of (like a fractional reserve bank), I'm sure they could offer a 0 fee bitcoin ATM as well. Fuck that though, the one of the main reasons I like btc is because it let's you get away from precisely that (not having control of your own money)

There is no such thing as an activation fee for Amazon gift cards. This is more like a "we want fat profit" fee. Amazon gift cards cost nothing to activate.

Hmm, very interesting. If blocks are generated every second would that mean that the block reward would be way smaller? Would this mean that something like 30 confirmations would be ideal instead of the current ~6? Confirmation times definitely are an obstacle IMO. Glad to see people trying to tackle the problem. 
Edit: after reading, this seems like a huge change to the BTC protocol.

And my grandmother, friends, and acquaintances don't give a fuck... They want to use something convenient to pay for parking. Not some crypto currency that they don't understand, is volatile, don't know how to properly secure, and requires quite a bit of effort to get ahold of. 
This seems like it would hardly be worth it at all... If anything it would cost tons of money.

Apple is incredibly forward thinking and innovative on some fronts and IMO its pretty obvious. For example, iPhone design, high dpi displays, etc. I'm a firm android guy but style certainly innovates... Works great for a majority of naive users, but for people like us there are better options.

They had a wallet app on a tablet that they used. I use the coinbase app and keep a bit of btc in it at all times. They entered the price in their tablet and gave me a qr code to scan with my wallet app. My wallet app prompted me to send 10 millibitcoin to their address, I accepted, and got my food.
