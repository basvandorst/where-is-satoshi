8 years in the Bitcoin game and I never got an IRS letter. Been using Coinbase since 2013 but never had to KYC with them until 2018. I plan to just file taxes based off of whatever Coinbase sends to the IRS and say I used the Bitcoin to purchase digital services whenever I transfer BTC off Coinbase. That way it's super easy to file Bitcoin taxes and I stay compliant.

yes, they can audit me, but they won't find anything that's not accounted for in my records. I've never had to prove that money I spent was accounted for by the recipient beyond a paper receipt and I have receipts for every nickel and bitcoin spent. Every receipt adds up to my reported income.   
What happens to that Bitcoin after I spent it is not up to me to pay taxes on. That's up to the person or business I spent it at when they spend or sell it.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is a trust system and you can't trust anyone or anything when it comes to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is scam central and I'm sure if adoption increases so will the scams and hacks. Exchanges are the wild west and if I've learned anything with my experience in the last 9 years it's that exchanges can do whatever they please with little to no repercussions. They will run circles around lawyers citing anti money laundering, stolen bitcoins, and KYC issues to name a few. Bitcoin is property not money and police are not equipped to investigate digital property.

This is from a discussion that took place on November 25th. I work in IT and have a few childhood friends who work in security, hacking, and exploiting type fields. I was told from a source that their API had been exploited. Then another source stepped in with the following:

&lt;&gt; may have been a side effect
&lt;&gt; but yea, just a heads up as I currently don't have proof in the form of images but via a reliable source who told me my cell phone number which is used for the 2FA
&lt;&gt; which is on a burner phone that is only used for 2FA

Been a while since I've messed with trend lines so I may have done that wrong. However if it's correct it appears we should have a change in trend around Feb 6th. 
Chinese new year ends around the same time I believe so I'm rather interested to see what happens. If we break that bottom trend the next support level is $400 to $500. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:16:38
Because all the smart people know not to buy Bitcoin in a down trend. While you are losing money trying to catch a falling knife the rest of us will buy back in after the knife has landed for a greater profit. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:24:28
They can get lucky and get cheaper buys that way. They can also keep averaging down as the knife keeps falling like some are doing.
Do you remember when people were saying the same thing when the price of bitcoin went from $1,200 to $1,000? All those people who bought back at $1,000 because "it's a good idea to buy (when price goes down)" are still kicking themselves and holding the bag. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:01:40
I'm going to say because technical analysis via long term trend called it. Analysis showed that bitcoin would enter a down trend around Feb 6th. 
My own personal analysis showed the trend breaking earlier than expected on Feb 5th with no change in trend. However a few hours later it crashed as expected. Maybe my crappy lines were off by a few degrees. Maybe it was all coincidence. 
In any case, the crash was called long before MT Gox or any other news related reports hit mainstream. In fact I had only done my own chart analysis because others started calling the crash back in mid-late January. 
TL;DR: Price drop was result from trend analysis, news only exacerbated the drop
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:28:58
You might be confusing "scared and sell" with them predicting bitcoin price to drop lower. It's more like "sell now and buy back lower for greater profits." Or keep holding from $800 and see where that gets you. To each their own. Everyone has a different style of investing and making profit.

I too am interested in this. The more bitcoin's the government seizes the more coins that become lost forever. They already seized a crap ton from the SilkRoad case. I don't know what happens to monetary evidence though. I'm lead to believe all evidence is stored for eternity.

Most likely malware of some sort as others have concluded. I'll share how I got scammed out of a couple hundred dollars using a hardware wallet and a Bitcoin marketplace on Tor.   
So the Bitcoin marketplace I regularly used went down for good so I had to find a new one to use. I heard good things about a particular marketplace from multiple people on reddit and used the onion address for it provided in the  subreddit. I created a new account on the marketplace and placed an order to which the marketplace then provided the BTC address to send the payment to. I copied the BTC address into my wallet app, verified the address matched on my hardware wallet, and sent the Bitcoin. The transaction confirms after a bit but on the marketplace it still says unpaid. So I open a support ticket with the marketplace and explain that I sent the bitcoin to the given address, it has 30+ confirmations by now and it still says unpaid. The marketplace admin replies and says that the BTC address I sent the Bitcoin to was incorrect and provides a different BTC address.   
I'm slightly confused so I go back to the order page and it's still showing the BTC address I sent the Bitcoin to. So I decide to check from another computer, I went to the onion URL, logged in, went to order page, and it still gives me the BTC address I sent the Bitcoin to. So I reply back to the admin with screenshots this time. He replies again saying to check the URL in my screenshot and sends a list of the 5 marketplace URLs one of which is the URL I'm using. So now I'm really confused; I've checked from two different computers on two different networks and I quadruple check the URL in my browser with the URL the admin told me to use. It's exactly the same.   
So now I seek help from a 3rd party forum where multiple marketplaces are discussed/rated w/e. They also have a list of known onion URL's for each marketplace. I find the marketplace on the list and check if the URL I'm using is on it and it was. So I make a post on the forum like "did this marketplace scam me?" and one of the mods DM me. We go back and forth and I explain that the URL I used for the marketplace is on the forum's marketplace list. He gives me a list of URLs saying that he uses those and one of them is the URL I used. So at this point I'm starting to catch on to what's happening. I reply to the mod with the screenshot including the URL in the browser and the list of URLs he sent me in DM and ask him to verify if those URLs in the screenshot are the same ones he just sent me. Finally I confirm what was happening. The URL for the marketplace that I got from Reddit was acting as a proxy to the real marketplace's website and was changing all the onion URLs in the HTML to the scam Proxy URL's. And was changing the BTC addresses to their own scam addresses. I don't remember how I got the forum URL but it was also a proxy URL changing all the onion URLs on the forum to other scam proxy URL's.

The year is 2030. Fiat has imploded and is worthless. Bitcoin can no longer be purchased using online exchanges since fiat has no value. As an early adopter all you have is the Bitcoin you bought in 2019. Those who didn't buy Bitcoin before fiat imploded are broke and trying to trade goods and services for Bitcoin. Stores and retailers have all switched to using Bitcoin. You go to the grocery store and pick up 30 days worth of food and the checkout price comes to 0.01897624 Bitcoin. Is this a fair price for the food?

No, I don't believe the GPU prices will fluctuate with crypto price or difficulty. I'm saying that I think GPU prices will be based on their hashing performance. It doesn't matter what the difficulty or crypto coin price is at. The performance price for a GTX 1060 should always be around $340 a card. 
For example the last rumored price of GTX 2080 was $1,500. If that price tag matches the performance capability then that card should get around 1,500 sol/s on Equihash. If however the price does not match the performance lets say the card can only do 900 sol/s then the fair price for the GTX 2080 should be $900. 
Each hashing algorithm would have a different ratio of hash/s to dollar. I just use Equihash as the example since it's roughly 1:1 ratio. I would estimate DaggerHashimoto is around 1:14 ratio. 1MH = $14.

Fair enough. But if the Government goes that far to track down the owner of every wallet in the USA then Bitcoin was a success and I'll have much more to gain from it in the future. 
Secondly. I'm sure I have bitcoin in other wallets that I've forgotten about or were stolen over the years including bitcoin from services like instantwallet, mtgox, e-btc, and cryptsy. If the Government wants to find those wallets for me I'd be game as again I would stand to make more money than I would owe in taxes by recovering those lost bitcoins.

Not since I had Antminer S4 ASICs. The new rig I built in February is 8x GTX 1060 GPU's so I don't mine Bitcoin directly anymore. I was mining Zcash and converting to Bitcoin but last week I started mining Ravencoin which has potential at being an actual ASIC resistant coin since it uses a random algorithm.
I realize that means I am not "facilitating transactions" on the Bitcoin network since I am not mining Bitcoin directly. However Bitcoin is dominated by ASICs which can get far better performance for the power consumption so I believe Bitcoin miners will have a similar stance concerning mining Bitcoin directly.

I think hardware wallets are the future of crypto and it's safer to hold onto your money yourself. The problem with holding your money in a bank with a debt based currency is that there's not enough cash for everyone to withdraw their money.

I will mine crypto to the very end and then donate my hashing power to the folding project. 
Bitcoin has been unprofitable to mine a few times in its history. It's about sticking it through until the value of bitcoin increases enough to pay back the electricity cost spent to mine it. 
I think the average electricity rate in America is something like $0.11/kWh for residential. My rig consumes 1kW/h or rounded up to $80/month. That's less than $1,000/year spent to earn free internet money for doing nothing. Even if Bitcoin goes down to $3,000 I would still be able to profit from 12 months of mining on the current rig.

The part that feels the worst is that pretty much all my friends are Bitcoin haters and have been making fun of me since the beginning for mining it and investing in it.

Then Bitcoin went from $1k to $20k and I missed out on being a millionaire to rub it in their faces.

No, I have no Bitcoin Cash. But what I'm getting at is that if you buy 1 bitcoin at $10,000.  You could immediately spend the 1 bitcoin and pay no income taxes on it, right?
Let's say you move the bitcoin from coinbase to binance exchange. You can then say you "spent" the bitcoin and no longer have it. IRS has no way of knowing and you would not file anything with IRS regarding bitcoin because you did not have any taxable income from bitcoin still/yet. 
This is the principle I've used for the last 8 or so years. In 2017 I made no bitcoin withdrawal so I did not file any bitcoin taxes for last year. As I miner in previous years I have withdrawn bitcoin to my USD bank account and I filed it as a loss because it was mined not purchased and thus there's no proof of what I "paid" for it. So I ended up getting money back from IRS on bitcoin even though I actually profited and should have paid income tax on it.

fair enough

I doubt GPU prices will go back down any time soon. I've been a miner for a long time and noticed that ASIC prices are priced based on their hashing power and return on investment. I believe GPUs will be headed in the same direction. For example a GTX 1060 can mine Equihash at 340 hashes/sec. Thus a baseline/fair price for the GTX 1060 is around $340 or $1/hash/s.

I don't know what banks you use but my bank takes 3-5 business days to transfer money. Even credit card transactions take days to process. You can see this in the pending transactions on your credit card activity.

I would say if anyone is dropping out it's because they are using old hardware like an Antminer s3 or something.

They are all fake and are only meant to be collectibles. There used to be physical Bitcoins which had holographic stickers and QR codes behind them which could be used like a paper wallet. I don't know if they are still around though.

I wouldn't think so because Bitcoin mining farms are using ASIC miners which cannot perform any other task except mining bitcoin and any other clone coin with the same algorithm. 
GPU mining farms would not be mining Bitcoin because it's not profitable to mine Bitcoin with GPUs. Thus GPU farms are mining altcoins like Ethereum or ZCash which is still quite profitable to mine and when they are not profitable they will most likely switch to another profitable altcoin to mine.

I used to buy stuff with my bitcoin... The heartache came when bitcoin hit 19k and instead of having the 7+ bitcoin that I mined over the last few years I had less than 1 bitcoin.

Am I the only one not paying taxes on cryptos until I withdraw the money into a USD bank account?
Unless you're providing your bitcoin wallet addresses to the IRS there is no way to tell what you did with your bitcoin after purchasing it. Especially once it's spread across altcoins. The IRS is not equipped yet to handle Bitcoin taxation IMHO.

I hear ravencoin is making use of that with their asset tokens.

Don't you just need the wallet.dat file? assuming the location of it moved also. That's how I restored my old address from a backup.

I'm not aware of people having their accounts closed due to crypto transactions. I have one of the top Credit Unions in America and they block crypto transactions for credit cards, debit cards, and wire transfers now. The transaction to my bank gets rejected and it goes back to Coinbase.

I mine and then play the market with the mined coin. Been mining since 2010 but spent most of my bitcoin by 2016 unfortunately.

I only got into bitcoin for buying drugs on Silk Road to be honest. I didn't have any local contacts back then and Silk Road was the best way to get the goods. 
I have no idea how many bitcoin I've spent on Silk Road and other darknet markets but I can tell you I've been receiving regular monthly darknet packages for at least 8 or 9 years and it's all thanks to mining Bitcoin. I can technically say I've never paid for drugs in my life since I bought it with magic internet beans, :)

The value of Bitcoin is typically it's last sale price. The sale price is whatever the last price a person bought or sold bitcoin at. Imagine 100 people lined up to buy Bitcoin at $9,000 or less. Another 100 people lined up to sell Bitcoin at $9,500 or more. In this scenario the value of bitcoin won't move if no one is willing to buy bitcoin at $9,500 or sell their bitcoin at $9,000. But if someone decides to make a trade at either of those prices then the value of bitcoin has changed.
