So that's where he says that those entities must apply those same rules for *all fucking things that qualify as a* cryptocurrency.


Yeah, I'm aware of what his statement is saying, and I never once argued contrary to the above. Still, you seem to be fixated on the other argument you were having higher up in the thread. And now you want to pretend that anyone who is setting you straight must not have read the article. Lil bud, the only thing I have stated is this:


Do you agree with that statement or do you need to reread a fifth time?

*If* this is the case (which other users may fairly contest), which coin would you consider the best for each layer? It seems that the common complaint about Bitcoin is that it makes a poor Layer 2 instrument, and the common rebuttal is that it's meant to be Layer 1.

A while back.

Wait, I'm confused. Wasn't his assertion that the SEC is implying its intent to treat cryptocurrency (and therefore Bitcoin, which is undeniably a cryptocurrency) as a security —and instating an unambiguous requirement that, like any security, all relevant payments should be tracked and reported?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:17:33
Ok, well regardless of whether or not that's his assertion, what I stated is a direct paraphrase of the SEC statement (as quoted above).
The SEC is saying that cryptocurrencies may be securities and that for all cryptocurrencies, all transactions should be tracked as if they were cash payments. I don't think it could have anything more to do with the SEC statement. Trolling?

Not really a huge element in the grand scheme of things. Most places that used to accept Bitcoin as currency now understand that it's largely a digital store of value — a way to safekeep and move larger amounts of money without the need for intermediaries

If you just call it Free WiFi, you are in your legal rights, so long as you don't violate the CFAA, which just using coinhive does not do.

Agreed. The strength of any nation's currency is directly tied to the fortitude of the nation itself and the expectation that it (and its banks) will be secure in perpetuity. [I wrote a silly term paper on this.](
That said, Bitcoin is not backed or controlled by a government, which is part of what is so exciting about it.

I agree with you on  and  But my point is that plenty of people still cite Number of Daily Transactions like it means something. It's in all of the charts. This is likely because velocity is usually (with other currencies) a good measure of vitality. But I'm glad you agree that it's pretty useless in the case of a cryptocurrency.
As for  transaction fees, [for a lot of transactions they should really only end up being the cost of the bandwidth and processing to move the data itself.](
Now, are these transactions the ones included in the Daily Number of Transactions? Probably not. I'm guessing that statistic comes from aggregated data provided by major wallets, platforms like Coinbase, and traders like Bitfloor. Not 100% sure on that.
But would people be able to artificially inflate the currency enough to beat transaction fees? I don't think it's completely unreasonable, especially if —not suggesting that this is the case— a major stakeholder or network of mid-level stakeholders were doing it. What do you think?
Thanks for discussing!
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:30:25
Haha, do I detect sarcasm?
I know the idea that the currency is a bit... untethered from equity is kind of a no brainer. However, I do think that there is valuable utility that can be gained from using BTC. For example, cheaper transaction fees (in some cases), something that a government would have a harder time tracking the movements of, etc. might have value to people.
In a way, I feel like that's what most people are trying to measure (and doing a poor job of): the level of usefulness provided by BTC.
But yes, it's a fugazi. [It's a wazi, it's a woozi... it's fairy dust!](
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:11:09
This is really the reason I was asking, but I didn't want to provoke pro-BTC hostility. ;] People can get kind of prickly when you imply that a lie is the only thing keeping their investment as valuable as it is.

Stopping mining would decrease the number of miners and hashes, thus increasing mining fees, making it more lucrative to mine.
Additionally, if demand for coins continued to rise (which will happen as long as there are new people who find utility in BTC) without miners mining more coins (static supply), then, again, mining becomes more lucrative.
All in all, if the price is dropping, miners might stop as a result. But miners will never stop to *make the price drop* because it wouldn't work that way and they'd lose money.

How can I segregate my coins? I want to avoid replay causing issues for my BTC while keeping my B2X intact.

can you help me understand why monero is worth having? always curious about different perspectives (makes sense to me that anyone who adopts new tech like bitcoin should be open to whatever follows it).
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:39:28
For those beginners with holdings, what would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:12:46
Unfortunately, we're likely on our way to many catastrophic events, driven by the parties who stand to lose the most if Bitcoin becomes more valuable without first being regulated (banks and their lobbyists, the U.S. government, the Fed, the IRS). I can imagine four phases:
1. Late to the game, regulators try to make Bitcoin safer (and more easily taxed and manipulated) as an investment vehicle. Banks feed this, attempting to lobby their way into the game. When they realize that people holding Bitcoin have considerable power over their money, the more alarmist voices will begin to win out.
2. Most states will follow Russia's example, creating a state cryptocurrency in hopes of satisfying people's desire for the conveniences and upside offered by crypto. Unfortunately, due to lack of talented developer-cryptographers willing to join these projects, the currencies will see weaker adoption, especially when their security flaws fail the few who invest in them.
3. Governments try to compensate for this by illegalizing any coin that doesn't yield to capital controls. A few people will be made examples of. Countries will spend whole summits drafting accords to try and regulate state-issued currency back into fashion.
4. ??? Governments may eventually give in or win. But in any case, it will be an even more turbulent ride when BTC gets truly popular.

@_date: 2017-10-16 01:41:14
So rather than an investment vehicle and store of value, I might consider adopting Monero because of its utility as actual currency, right? Thanks for the intro.

Great! Is there a place I can sign up for updates? Once replay protection is in place, I'll definitely want to download.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:42:11
Very helpful. I don't yet entirely understand Bitcoin's capability to update (would it take the form of a fork like Ethereum's Byzantium?), but it's interesting to consider what Bitcoin would be willing to do and on what timescale vs. Monero and other alts. HODL time!
