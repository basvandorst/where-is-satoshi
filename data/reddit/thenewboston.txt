Thanks! I am hoping that r/Bitcoin will also help out with the development too. I could post updates here, and hopefully you guys can give advice on who to interview and any other suggestions for the movie as well. I am sure that we would be able to create a really awesome documentary. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:03:44
Send me a link to your profile and I will send you some credits. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:32:13
I mean that I would release the video for free on YouTube. The documentary would still cost money to make. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:19:52
Same here :)
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:37:59
Database? Dragon balls?

More like a list of why Bitcoin needs to succeed :) 
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:54:11
For me, my roomate was trying to play online poker about a year ago. It's banned in the US, so he tried just using prepaid credit cards but that didn't work. Thats when he read online about Bitcoin and then told me about it. I bought some about a week later and have been using it ever since :)
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:18:53
I think that a documentary would be MUCH more beneficial. Most people don't really even understand what Bitcoin is yet. They might have heard of it before and may even know that it is a digital currency, but the majority of people have no idea where to get it, how to spend it, or anything else about it. I think that it will help Bitcoin a lot more to first educate people about the basics of it before teaching them how to program with it.

Does anyone know how much it would cost to sponsor a UFC fighter? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:11:14
I use the blockchain API and PayPal both on my site. PayPal let's users pay with credit card, so I just give the user the option at checkout of paying with PayPal or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:05:24
It will be somewhat flexible. Obviously, the more we raise then the better the final product.
We already have a lot of the equipment needed too (microphones, editing software, etc...) so that should help with the budget. I have a lot of friends (who are also Bitcoiners) that work in Visual Effects and they already told me that they can help out too. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:24:45
How so?
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:30:59
Yes please, criticism and tips are welcome!
And I eventually want to make it entirely free to use. The only reason I have a small fee now is because I am worried that if it is free, users would post fake items for sale such as "Your Moms Butt - 69 BTC". I think that a fee deters 99% of spammers and trolls from using the site. 
Also, we have a feedback system (similar to eBay, Amazon, etc...) and if users didn't have to pay for listings, they could just give their friends a bunch of positive feedback :/
@_date: 2014-07-13 16:41:56
Well this is getting a better response than expected :)
Thanks for all the suggestions guys. If anyone would like to help beta test, here is the link:
There are still a few minor improvements we are making (adding some charts and graphics, etc...) but it is fully functional already. It's set at 1,000 impressions for 0.0004 BTC for now (we will be raising this once development is complete) Also, there is no minimum either. 
Any advertisers are welcome to try it out. (Please note that it may take a little longer to serve image ad impressions since there aren't that many publishers yet)
Publishers are welcome to create ads to place on your websites too. Your earning are updated in real time. If anyone has any issues or has any more suggestions, please let me know. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:04:21
We are going to have a setting that lets each user choose which Bitcoin unit they would like displayed. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 02:36:58
How can it be decentralized if it is inside Ripple?
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:21:15
Thanks. There is still a lot of work to be done but it's a start!
@_date: 2014-07-13 16:26:08
Thanks for the suggestions. And also, when you place an ad unit on your website, the system will randomly choose to display either an image ad or a text ad. All ad sizes are capable of displaying both types of ads. 
If no image ads are available, it will automatically show text ads, and vice versa. This way, paid ads are prioritized and publishers can always display profitable content. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:57:12
Yes they will, but I believe that widespread adoption will be faster and easier for people if the units don't keep changing. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 09:38:24
To be honest, I haven't even started thinking about the storyboard for the documentary. It's just an idea right as of now. Just wanted to make a post to see if anyone would be interested :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:15:59
Thanks. Try it out, let me know what you think :) 500 bits @_date: 2014-08-19 08:30:38
you're thinking of litecoin 
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:00:49
It is in beta testing now, there are still a few more features we are working on. We are hoping that it will be ready within the next 2 weeks.  
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:39:41
By the time this movie gets released everything is going to be outdated. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:35:50
Can you post a screenshot? It was tested in Safari, IE, Firefox, and Chrome before we released it and everything was working fine. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:30:19
Why exactly is Apple not allowing Bitcoin wallet apps? I don't really understand why they would care. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:35:05
Yep. Same reason I highly doubt eBay will ever adopt Bitcoin. People would realize how much of a rip off PayPal is. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:03:10
Awesome suggestions, some other things are:
* How to get Bitcoin (mining and buying)
* Silk Road
* MtGox (clear up the confusion that MtGox is NOT Bitcoin)
* Big companies that are starting to accept Bitcoin
I think that including topics such as the Silk Road and MtGox will help give a fair and balanced point of view of Bitcoin. Also clear up the confusion that Bitcoin never got "hacked" like many people believe.
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:09:23
What about to the moon? 
@_date: 2014-07-13 16:09:56
You already can. After you create an ad, you can place the code on any of your websites that you would like to monetize. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:20:57
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:13:41
Send me a link to your profile and ill send you some :)

@_date: 2014-07-20 02:32:05
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:00:11
Don't worry it's legit. Just made a post about it on my profile: 
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:13:43
I agree. Everything they filmed and talked about is going to be old news by the time it's released. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 05:53:20
Thanks, I was looking for a list like this earlier today :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 03:38:45
Nope, users can create ads to place on their website as well: 
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:37:36
It seems that the only people who aren't on the bitcoin wagon are the one's who don't understand it. There wasn't a lot of good sites where people could buy and sell things with bitcoin, so I figured I might as well make one :)
And thanks for watching my tutorials, glad they could help you out.
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:21:57
I wasn't sure what to name it. It was the first name that came to mind. I want to keep it integrated with the social network (called BuckysRoom) so that the users can earn Bitcoin. However, it would be easy to change the name. Any suggestions? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:45:27
Thanks. It may not be the most technical, but it does help beginners better understand the concept :)
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:27:44

You can keep track of all earnings and ad performance by visiting your Publisher Panel when you log in. Here is a screenshot: 
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:28:56
We will give advertisers the choice of CPM or CPC campaigns in the future. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:27:15
It just seems like a bigger priority to me, educating people about the basics of Bitcoin first. I think that if we can create an awesome, original documentary about Bitcoin first, people will then become much more interested in it and will want to learn more about it, such as how to program with it. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 09:46:56
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:16:13
Trying to make something easy to understand for people doesn't mean that you are "belittling their intelligence" 
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:56:18
If we do raise the funds, in addition to uploading the video to YouTube so that everyone can watch it for free, we will also allow free digital downloads of the movie to everyone. I think that this will be the best way to spread the word and help educate people on Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:11:55
Haha your "OMGWTFBBQ" made me laugh. This idea is getting a lot more support than I thought! Yea, there are definitely a lot of people who are interested in learning about Bitcoin, it would probably be one of my most watched videos. It would be really fun to make too :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:25:36
Does anyone have a YouTube link to this video so I can embed it on my site? 
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:18:01
Haha thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed them because I am definitely never doing that again!
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:00:42
I remember first hearing about Bitcoin and thinking that it sounded "cultish" kind of like some scam. Then once I actually started learning about how it works and the network I realized how awesome it was. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:21:23
Weren't there some credit card companies who were lobbying against Bitcoin and crypto?
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:17:35
When the user creates an account, a new wallet is automatically created for them using the Blockchain API. It is integrated directly into their account, so whenever they buy an item, it sends the Bitcoin directly to the sellers wallet. 
Users can also send Bitcoin to one another directly on the site (without the need to buy or sell anything). Every profile displays the Bitcoin address of that user :)
@_date: 2014-06-20 10:42:38
Holy crap, this blew up. Ok guys, so let's do this!
Alright, so I have a few questions for you guys. First, what platform do you think we should use to fund this? It seems like here are the options:
1. Bitcoinstarter.com - Obvious choice, however, only people who own Bitcoin would be able to contribute. Also, the site doesn't get a lot of traffic. 
2. Kickstarter - I would rather not, I heard of them suspending Bitcoin related projects.
3. Indiegogo.com - People can donate using PayPal, credit cards, and I can also post the QR code and Bitcoin donation address for people who want to contribute in Bitcoin. 
My vote is for Indiegogo, but if you guys think that we should use something else then I’m all for it. 
Also, how much funding should we ask for? The more funding we receive, the better the final result. We will be doing the majority of the filming and editing, but we still need to cover equipment costs, travel expenses during our interviews, visual effects and animation costs, etc…
A few of the other Bitcoin related crowdfunding projects I've seen have raised over $75k. If we can raise anywhere around this, I know that we will be able to create the best Bitcoin documentary to date. It sounds ambitious, but I want this documentary to be the best :)
I would love to get everyones opinion before making any decisions. I don’t want this to be just another Bitcoin video on YouTube, I want it to be the best Bitcoin documentary there is. Let me know what you all think!
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:27:44
Can I transfer Bitcoin from a Blockchain wallet to a Coinbase wallet and sell it to them? Or can I only sell back the coins I buy directly from them?
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:20:25
Yep, I've had my asus laptop for about 3 years and not one problem. Pretty impressive, especially for a laptop. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:19:34
Thank you 500 bits @_date: 2015-05-27 03:49:46
Hmm it looks like epix is just a cable channel, so I guess we can just watch it there at first? Their website is kind of confusing. Thanks for the share though, looks awesome. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:12:50
One of the users from my site made this video for me because I was saying how that a lot of people don't really understand Bitcoin yet. What do you guys think? It is just a rough draft, she said if I wanted anything changed to let her know :) 
It seems pretty good to me, and the beginning does help people better understand the concept of Bitcoin, but obviously the story about hats and points is inaccurate. I am going to ask her change that part, but I am not sure how we can explain how the Bitcoin program works to beginners without using a metaphor like this. Any ideas?
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:46:18
We have a feedback system in place to help build trust among buyers and sellers. And you’re right, the transactions are non-reversible, but that is one of the trade offs you make when using Bitcoin rather than traditional systems. 
Why would a buyer use this over eBay? Simply because you can’t use Bitcoin on eBay. Maybe they will allow it in the future, but we are not ready to sit back and wait around for that to happen. Until then, we believe that the Bitcoin community could use a place where they can buy and sell items easily.
We are developing a system that allows users to buy and sell goods for almost zero fees without the need of a central authority. Isn’t that what Bitcoin is all about? Our goal was never to create a marketplace that’s bigger than eBay, but we will create one that is better. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:27:11
Do you know where it will be available to watch?
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:56:48
I should also mention that development is far from over (still in pre-alpha), but we are hoping to have a stable developer release completed by the end of the month. 
As for future development, we are currently working on a responsive site design, developing our own independent Bitcoin API (right now we are using the Blockchain API), several additional security/privacy related features, and rebuilding the entire ad network from the ground up. Should be a very exciting next couple of months :)
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:37:35
Yep, that's me. And thank you.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:44:32
I saw this today too and was confused. Why does this appear when the price of Bitcoin has been much higher (like when it was over $1,000)?
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:19:30
What website is that?
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:19:58
$50,000,000?!
