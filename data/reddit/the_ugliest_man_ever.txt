This is going deep, my friend. The market cap of gold is $7.8 trillion. 
By comparison, the total size of the cryptocurrency market (altcoins and all) stands at about $161 billion as of October 26th. 
I think BTC could easily eat 30% of gold's market cap by end of 2018. My math may be a bit rusty here, but that puts over $100k/coin. Just sit back, relax, and ride this dragon.

Once they wrapped their heads around what it was and what implications it brought with it, they were very interested in it. 
Not even so much in using it, but in seeing what it could be used for. In seeing what Wall Street will do with it.

It will shrink their power. That power needs to be reduced anyway. Dollars don't move fast enough, so they have to be turned into theoretical tokens to be traded with speed. Bitcoin is a theoretical token, only it's also got enforced scarcity.
Once traders start using this, it's going to push the market cap like nothing ever seen before. If (and obviously, this is a considerable time down the road, and is still a big 'if') Bitcoin took over the entire derivatives market (and continued with other disruption), we could see the satoshi surpass the dollar in value. 
The mere fact that it's capable of that means that I'm not going to be watching these guys like a hawk.

Say what you will about them, but the Coinbase Vault feature has let me sleep easy. Especially since they added the true multisig support.

Most of those hacks come from being careless with API keys. Change passwords often, disable API's when not in use, and use 2FA. For the convenience it offers, it's very secure, but nothing, *NOTHING* is 100%.

Not what I would've chosen, but it's a very elegant technology aimed squarely at existing traders. It's coming from a Wall Street guy to other Wall Street guys. Whatever he calls it. This is one I'm paying very close attention to.
For the most part, once these kinds of guys hear that they're dealing with other tokens that aren't Bitcoin itself (no matter how integrated it may be), they get a bit skittish about potential flaws in another blockchain, or pre-mine, or all the headaches that come with an entire blockchain.
This one uses Bitcoin as the token to trade everything. Trades of abstract commodities, stocks, currencies all enforced by the mathematically-ensured scarcity of Bitcoin itself.

And **THIS**, boys and girls, is why companies like Coinbase monitor transactions. Don't like it? Don't use US companies. 
Seriously, I've spent my career working at banks and MSB's. Uncle Sam wants companies to know where the money's coming from and where it's going to. And if you don't keep track, you're crippled with a hefty fine your company can't afford. No company sets out wanting to do compliance. It's a waste of payroll, office space, manpower, and resources. But unless you do it, you will be staring down the barrel of fines like these or worse.
This is what happens when you force a spaceship to use the railroad tracks. Decentralization, folks. Learn it. Build it. Use it. It's what Satoshi would've wanted.

From the Parsemus Foundation page:
"Many of the studies we support involve low-cost approaches that are not under patent. When supporting development of technologies under patent, Parsemus Foundation coordinates with larger funders to make sure support is contingent upon strong public-sector pricing agreements."

That's the most logical assumption. "Hey everyone! We're a full-on exchange now, but not everywhere. Heres 12 more states though. The rest are 'coming soon'."
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:48:54
You really can't go wrong with either. Test them both and find which one you prefer. I lean towards Coinbase just because I use that exchange and there's slightly less friction when a Coinbase customer pays a Coinbase merchant. Again though, to each his own. Besides, too much centralization has never been good for Bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:02:46
I'd have to assume the states where they have MTL's. They keep a list [here.](
@_date: 2015-01-09 07:04:22
You're thinking of a CTR (currency transaction report) . Those are required anytime cash changes hands in excess of $10,000. Since Coinbase doesn't take or give cash, there's no reason they would ever need to bother with those. 
A SAR (suspicious activity report) is another matter. As an MSB, if they don't file a SAR on accounts they have reason to believe are being used for illegal activity, they get fined, penalized and eventually shut down by FinCEN.
Honestly though, if it's to the point they're filing a SAR, you'll probably get some kind of warning or communication beforehand. I can tell you that "high volume" by itself isn't a good enough reason to file one of those.

Trying to be anonymous on Coinbase is a bit like going to an expensive, high end, members only bar for a Coca Cola.  
It may work once or twice, but really you're barking up the wrong tree. Especially now that they're vying for state by state licenses, you can expect that anyone who doesn't comply with KYC will get weeded out and booted pretty quick. 
It's not what Cody Wilson would want, it takes them one step closer to just being a full on bank, and it's hardly in keeping with the spirit of what Satoshi started, but if you want to have any success in the US financial industry, there are three words you need to live by: "Comply or Die."

Hi, welcome! 
So with Bitcoins, it depends on you how much info you want to give. Localbitcoins is the most private option, but you're meeting a stranger with cash and the exchange rate is going to be terrible. 
The easiest way is to use a simple brokerage service like Circle or Coinbase. Their wallets are online, but as long as you practice good password hygiene and set up 2 factor authentication, you should be ok. Coinbase ups the ante on that with a pretty cool vault feature as well. 
The third option is to go to a full-on exchange like Bitfinex or OKcoin, but that requires wiring money outside the country. And having worked at banks, nothing catches the eye of Uncle Sam more than international wire activity.
The easiest way honestly is going to be with Coinbase. They make things pretty painless if you're just buying small amounts and VPN's aren't on their prohibited business list (if it ever is, they've lost my business for sure). 
They've got a strong reputation for security, but keep in mind they do have the ability to seize funds if they want. I have no problem storing my funds there, but that's entirely up to you. You can transfer your BTC out no problem to any wallet you like though. Just be sure you secure your private keys. 
Bitcoin is all about choice. There's plenty of options out there. Coinbase works best for me because I use it lawfully and I don't want the hassle of securing my keys. Circle works better for others, and I'm sure there are dozens that we just haven't heard about that will work for everyone else. 
Hope that helps. Happy hunting! 
@_date: 2015-04-30 07:00:52
It took me all of five minutes to find those on my phone. It's like any other industry, OP. Get your resumé and references in order and get your ass out there. 
And if you don't like what those guys are doing, then go do something else. No serious recruiter is going to respond to a whiny, drunken redditor bitching about adversity. The fact is that we've all been laughed at one way or another in this community. But the way to shut them up is to prove them wrong. 
Now sober up, get in the game, and send us all a postcard if you make it. And unless you're applying for a job as Brian Armstrong's personal sommelier, then for fuck's sake keep your drinking habits to yourself until you've got the job. 
Godspeed, datalemur.

I've used the Coinbase recurring transactions feature. I was able to set it at a USD amount, but I don't know if they've changed it since (don't know why they would and I doubt they did). That sounds like what you're after. 
So every two weeks, I would automatically buy say $100 worth of BTC at whatever the rate was. The BTC amount would obviously change check to check, but it was always $100 that got pulled regularly after payday.
Just remember to use their multisig vault if you're hodling. Coinbase may be a great company so far, but why trust them if you don't have to? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:10:19
Don't use Coinbase if you'll be using any dark markets or gambling sites. Other than that, their regular wallet is very convenient. You can authorize apps to be able to pull funds or set up recurring payments. 
And their security is no joke. 2FA is practically mandatory and they have no limits on bounties for whitehats and according to their security page, their backend is pretty heavy as well. 
That being said, unless you're using their multisig vault, you don't have Bitcoins at Coinbase, you have an account denominated in Bitcoin. 
So use the advanced vault if you're hodling, and keep in mind that any balance in your regular wallet is under their control. 
Honestly, they have a good product, but it is a trust model and it's as complaint as a bank when it comes to anything even remotely illegal. 
Weigh it out. Coinbase isn't for everyone, but if you're a law-abiding noob who just wants an easy way to get started, either Coinbase or Circle are your best bets.

One dollar to this helpful redditor.
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:50:33
Yeah, you're not in control of the private keys with coinbase (unless you're using their multisig vault). 
But I honestly don't want to go through the trouble and worry of securing my own keys either. And if their security page is accurate, then they'll do a much better job than me at it anyway. 
I feel fine trusting them with my coins. Part of it is their track record. They've delayed buying and selling in the past, they've gotten a few minutes behind the blockchain, but I have never heard of anyone not being able to withdraw Bitcoin from coinbase unless coinbase themselves have seized the funds for some compliance reason. 
Solvency isn't something I'm concerned about when the investors in the company include the likes of USAA and the NYSE. Neither of those would invest a penny in a company that did anything to obfuscate it's holdings. Especially since a Bitcoin company is already going to be under added scrutiny. 
Mt. Gox happened. But everyone learned from it. After they closed down, Coinbase invited Andreas himself to perform am audit. If you go back to last year's posts in the coinbase blog, you should see it. He was thoroughly convinced. 
Bottom line, Coinbase is a major player right now, the biggest in the US for sure. And you don't get the kind of institutional support they have without providing assurances. 
A lot of what they do may indeed be contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin itself, but they are still the easiest on ramp I know of for the average user. Yes, they're complaint to a fault, but right now they're focused on the US market. And I can tell you from experience that you don't move the kind of money that coinbase moves without a thorough enema from Uncle Sam. 
So yes, for all intents and purposes they are indeed a bank. But they're also the easiest mechanism for using Bitcoin that I've ever come across and they've done one whole hell of a lot more to earn my trust than any bank I've ever done business with. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:22:13
Supposedly, they've been on a hiring spree recently. They could just be making sure they've got the infrastructure in place. Quadrupling your business in a few months would be a strain on any company. Knowing Coinbase, they're probably not going to charge the field until their ready on the back end.

The best thing that I've found is to talk about it to other people in front of her. The harder you sell, the more pushback you'll encounter. Just treat it like it's the most normal payment system/currency/investment in the world.
She'll ask the questions. This works for most. Rather than selling my friends on it, I just started posting news and investment tips on my facebook, and now not a week goes by that someone doesn't ask me how they can get in on it.
