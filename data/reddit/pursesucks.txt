I don't think that they were trying to defraud *me*, or I never would have used the site. Now, after using it, I see that there are some issues with their service - even aside from the customer support. 
Shipping, being a big one. Getting an order shipped anyway other than the default amazon shipping method required manual intervention with the support staff ( at this point. ) 
A multisig escrow account ( another big one ) seems like common sense, yet it's lacking.
I may try the service again, but I still wouldn't recommend it to friends. 
Hopefully, the pull it off. I'd like to see them succeed. Otherwise, starsoccer9 and I have some coding to do! ;)

Yeah.. I may or may not use the site again.. but I will NEVER recommend it to others.

Although there is still the HUGE issue of order time.
I placed the order with purse yesterday, and the order STILL had not been placed on amazon.com as of the time of this thread.
So, I still have clue when my order would have been here. ( I still don't, as it still hasn't been technically placed with amazon yet. Still waiting for that. )
But.. they are helping me now. So, thanks, reddit.

UPDATE 2: Got it worked out. Products on the way. 
So, just to reiterate, the service IS a little clunky, there are some issues ( with expedited shipping for instance ).
And my customer service experience has been mixed.. but
Thomas, has been AWESOME at fixing these issues. ( Once I got a hold of him. )

Or they could post hours of operation on their site. I didn't see any. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:55:03
Yeah, I don't see myself using their service again. It dosen't matter how 'cool' it is, or how much I can save. I'll pay 20% EXTRA to have real customer service. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:02:36
It was purseinstant, not a user of the site. 
And.. you're just making my case for the site being shitty.

Saturday morning.
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:46:28
I couldn't find hours of operation of their site. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 03:01:42
Thanks for the invite. Fortunately, there is no fraud involved; just poor initial customer service. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:32:51
It's in escrow, I believe. "Take" is perhaps the wrong word. I'm sure I'll get it back.. or maybe my order.. eventually, hopefully.
I just don't know what the order status is. The order hasn't been placed on amazon yet. So.. currently, it appears that they have taken my money, and not placed my order. 
I have no way to confirm this, since, you know, the whole non-existent customer service issue. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:27:57
And thanks, Thomas. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:10:31
But still.. shitty customer service is going to tank these guys.
I'm 100% sure the issue would be resolved if they would answer my customer service requests... It IS a weekend, but I can't find operating hours on their site.. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:37:20
It was a purseinstant order.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:08:25
It wasn't a user. It was purseinstant.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:00:55
There is an amazon order number on another order I placed on purse, so I KNOW that the other order has been placed on amazon. 
Also, considering that I could have placed the order directly and had it delivered on Monday ( which I would have done ) I don't think I'm jumping the gun.. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:21:05
Yeah, well, live and learn. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:39:59
Dashboard shows that my money is in escrow, the order has been *accepted*, and NOT PLACED on amazon. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:34:47
It was a purseinstant order. Getting close to 24 hours with no response..
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:06:45
What exactly have they tried?
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:39:41
Staying 'calm' wouldn't have resolved my issues, and got my order delivered. Just FYI.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:03:39
I'd pay 20% EXTRA for real customer service.. bitcoin isn't so cool that I want to deal with this BS to order something on amazon. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:42:39
I'm sure if they'd just RESPOND TO MY CUSTOMER SUPPORT REQUESTS the issue would be trivial, and easily resolved. 
However, with no communication from them, I'm just left to post random shit on reddit about how poor of customer service they provide. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:44:51
5%. That's no excuse for shitty customer service. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:08:03
Thanks for contacting me. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:04:57
I didn't say it was stolen. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:17:21
UPDATE: I have been in contact with customer service. As suspected, the issue seems easy enough to resolve.. ( once I was able to contact customer service. )
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:35:32
It was a purseinstant order.
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:48:14
Besides, I could have ordered my shit, and had it here by Monday. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:49:39
Well.. if they actually responded to customer service requests in a timely manner, it might be ok.
