Remember this dip or correction really impacts the charities and worthwhile causes that the pineapple fund have donated to and will donate to.  Let’s do what we can to show the world the power of bitcoin and reverse this devaluation!

I think there is an inverse relationship between the bitcoin markets and the bitcoin memes.  The more memes the higher the price. Since this crackdown on memes well we can all see where this heading.  At least we have strong meme support at 9k waiting!

So GDAX removed all the candles from before the  bCash incident even on the bitcoin charts. Making more FUD for all involved.  If I didn’t know better I’d say coinbase must be incompetent or complicit in this

I was once scammed on eBay selling an iPhone (I was the seller and the phone was legit) got paid by PayPal sent the phone once the money was in the account after sending the phone PayPal reverses the payment I was furious.  Will never use PayPal peer to peer again they are the devil in this story. The sooner a decentralized crypto alternative surfaces the better.
