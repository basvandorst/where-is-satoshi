In what way is it antisemitic?


Banks of a Jewish state. Banks owned by Jews.

It's the yearly bonus, not the standard pay check. So if you're living comfortable and wound up with an extra few k why not just dump it in BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:52:00
My TA still working. Have buy zones mapped out if it breaks the current support zone.

Bitcoin was created as a decentralised form of currency which would rival the current banking system and render them obsolete.
By your logic owning bitcoin is prejudice and thus antisemitic. Nice!
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:58:26
Well that's your BTC gone
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:00:19
Who'd have thought Jewish owned banks disliked crypto!?

Yup. HODL is a meme for a reason. now is the time to put fiat aside to wait for a bottom entry and add to stack.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:17:38
we dead, boys.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:06:36


on r/bitcoin because..... ah, you got rekt trying to 100x $400 of BTC on bitmex and now you're butthurt.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:07:05
Can't we buy BCH and do the reverse?

Told a guy in work about Bitcoin when it was $8k. He's like "I'll buy in at a reasonable price, like 6k" He's still waiting...

You'll trade a Satoshi and its derivatives as a daily currency metric, not entire bitcoins unless you're making massive trades/purchases
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:32:47
I thought that at 9k, expecting a pull back later this month could be 25% from current price or it could hit 50k and pull back 25%. Where do you want to be?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:46:55
You haven't decimated your assets. You're up from $24, just buy back, ignore price. HODL.

Psychological barriers are usual places markets will stop or rebound. These are round numbers 100, 250,...4000, 5500 etc etc. Bitcoin reaches psychological numbers, smashes through and treats them like any other number such as that in OP's title.

Okie Dokie

I'd actually prefer the abbreviation Sato to Sat.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:34:29
why not just ask "Do you accept Bitcoin?" in places you know they don't so they see how much it's a prefferred option?
That way you lose 0 BTC and still push the concept.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:24:30
Coinbase freezes you're account for months and you were planning on holding the whole time so no change. meh

They need to let us buy with GBP - Damn international payments required for the office in London. Scammers!

Irony is I tried to login to this account today to dump any savings in there on BTC &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:42:26
some one with large amounts of an asset (bitcoin) that can move markets with a sell/buyorder
