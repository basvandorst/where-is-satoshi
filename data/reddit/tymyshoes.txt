I think the best way to bring globally disconnected groups together to promote Bitcoin is to create a virtual world where users from across the globe can connect in a Matrix like environment where Bitcoin is the only accepted form of payment for services. These services provided by people in this environment would be so appealing that people would willingly seek out Bitcoin own their own, for their own benefits. 
I am talking about a world that doesn't already exist today, we need to build it! Using tech like the Oculus Rift or Hololens we could build a next generation virtual world where you can go walking through a virtual Best Buy and actually buy things that are automatically shipped to your home. A dating, bar, meetup environment where you can meet people in their virtual forms with no real risk. All powered by Bitcoin! New and existing businesses will flock to this world to provide their services because it's a free (open sourced) project that allows them to lower costs (fees, land, electricity and etc.). Users would flock to this world because let's face it, somedays you don't want to go outside.

What's great about the fork is that people like you and me who completely disagree can find happiness in our own echo chambers. ASSUMING the fork happens, what do you plan to do with your coins? If both of us held onto our coins we would both benefit from the other being correct. If one is correct and other other buy/sells based on themselves being wrong, only then do they lose?
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:57:42
Because for years we've tried to get them to increase the blocksize. We compromised many times and they still have not increase the blocksize. Even if you can store more transactions in a block with segwit, the blocksize variable is still unchanged. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:13:41
Holding since I got in a year ago, never sold and don't plan to... ever. My reoccurring buy continues. Bitcoin is simply the best form of money we have ever seen. Anyone doubting bitcoin's ability to replace gold's role as the universal store of wealth is not a true believer. [This]( video convinced me of that fact. Never sell, spend (in like 2020).

The increase in blocksize from Segregated Witness only happens once wallets release software allowing users to send those transactions. It doesn't automatically increase the overall blocksize right after being activated.

Yikes you wrote that in 20 minutes. 100% of all monetary transactions doesn't need to happen for Bitcoin to be the global currency. If it gets to 10% I'll be ecstatic, 4-6% will make it the clear winner. Meaning you can still do all that monetary stuff with the other portion.

I think people underestimate how scarce Bitcoins are. Just like how we don't use full gold bars worth $500,000 for gold prices and use the much smaller ounce $1,100. We will stop using the BTC distinction and use magnitudes smaller demoninations. People who own just a few entire BTC could easily retire once Bitcoin crosses the chasm. It really blows my mind the upside potential that Bitcoin offers.

Because of the BTC/BCH price (currently .087), miners can sell 1 BTC and get 11.5 BCH back. If they do that then get BTC to "flip" to BCH, then they would have  10x'd their original BTC position. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:40:54
Extreme numbers as an example.
Someone opens a long 200,000 btc position. The price later goes up 3x. The person wants to settle their position.. how will CME provide the extra billions in cash? Simple, they sell some of the BTC stash they bought when the person opened that position. On average across many people they would be able to cover the person closing that position.
It's pretty much how the financial world works.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:28:45
IMO it is still uncertain if 2x or BCH will reign supreme. I am certain the next bull cycle starts Nov 20th for whatever wins that's for sure.

@_date: 2016-09-27 03:16:53
It's speculation, they aren't going to straight up say it until everything is ready to go live. Read up on how [ETFs calculate NAV](
 "For an ETF tracking U.S. equities, for example, the NAV can be calculated soon after the U.S. market’s 4:00 p.m. ET close. At that time, the closing price of each of the fund’s assets is recorded as an indication of its current value. All these prices are then aggregated to arrive at the value of the fund’s entire portfolio."
Do you think the SEC is going to take the last trade that happened on their exchange per their [filing]( It's going to need volume for it to be accurate and reliable.

Ya'll don't seem to realize that the 2x part is already in the code an will, with 100% certainty, happen. The debate is about when the fork happens... what percent of all miners mine 1x and 2x?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:01:04
when the fork happens even if the hashing power is split exactly 50/50, 2x would win because even though blocks or found slower for both chains, more transactions fit in them where 1x would have a backlog. Segregated Witness has allowed &gt;1MB blocks, but not by a significant amount.

Nah I wasn't saying you were misinformed. Just frustrated like Roger is. No more talking needed, just actions (fork).

Most continue to think you're nuts and the ones that get in make money, but not much return for you as the educator. You just need to educate yourself and do what you think is correct and everyone who is misinformed, lazy, or simply wrong will be left behind.

I use coinbase and coinbase exchange to buy and sell bitcoins regularly. they even emailed me because I was sending a suspicious amount and needed to ask me questions (to comply with being a money transmitter). I also ask support for help with my app and also used to talk to their support people via their website regularly. Never once have I had a problem. Sure them asking me about where all my money came from was a little upsetting, but can you blame them? It's not like they WANT to do it, they HAVE to do it or else they are out of business. Countless times on people say to only use coinbase to buy/sell bitcoins and to NOT use them as a general purpose wallet and I've listened to that advice and have had no problems what so ever. I'm just trying to give another side of the story for coinbase because I am very pleased with the service I receive.

Kraken gets 4,000 a day so Polo probs gets more. I had someone from Polo respond (today) to a verification tier 3 ticket I opened yesterday. I also withdrew 6,900 worth of BTC today from Polo and it was included in the next block.
 
No idea why people keep complaining about Poloniex, Kraken, and Coinbase... besides them being slow during dumps they work fine for me (Illinois USA, tier 4 verified on Kraken, tier 3 Coinbase, tier 2 Poloniex but going to 4 when I can).

Enable 2FA.

Nope it's FUD! I don't want to risk posting the source as it links to another sub.

Thank you!

honestly and nicely asking what is your education and age?... for science.

Reggie Middleton himself posted this the other day. He knows it's a bit hard to read and will provide a simpler version when he has time. Also you waited 2 hours before letting your impatience get the better of you???????

What makes BTC more decentralized than BCC?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:49:44
Can't wait for people like you to be red pilled. You are completely wrong.

I completely agree with this statement. My funds are 100% legit and I don't mind complying with the KYC because I know it's because of the banks/regulators, not Coinbase.

How about transactions per second then?
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:52:53
One of us is delusional. Have you tried seeing the other perspective enough to be certain in your resolve? So happy that this debate will mostly resolve Aug 1st.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:53:09
before they have always said waiting for regulatory approval. Now they are saying they are launching. Seems legit.

And this is why we need the UASF. Because you can't blame the miners for what the core devs are doing!!!
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:41:36
The side that believes Bitcoin is being held back for dishonest reasons. I'm still heavily invested in Bitcoin, but to me I think it's failed. The only hope I have is that the public isn't aware of the leadership issues Bitcoin has. Oh, and that UASF, so grateful for that. I hope they follow through. Anything is better than the current stalemate.

Or take it up with the developers that had years to preemptively fix the issue, but didn't.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:12:24
You post enough that I know not to waste my time on you, you're too far gone! You just attack attack attack. I didn't say anything negative and only provided the other side of the coin so to speak. I even left myself open to being the one that may be wrong. I'll let the readers decided.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:54:47
Or it could be the developers' fault for not providing a solution that incentives the  super majority of miners to use it?
