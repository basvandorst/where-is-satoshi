If it weren't for porn, we would not have the technology, internet or even the politics we have today. Aligning bitcoin with sex is not a bad thing at all. It actually shows progress.

If something looks too good to be true, it is. Dear god, read that privacy statement.

Where do you find the "then"? Asking for a friend.

I take it from your reply this is a well known risk.

Thank you. Reading up on coinjoin, obfuscation through crowded transactions is def the way to go. While I have nothing to hide, the concept of anonymity tickles my interest. Well, that, and the principles of a blockchain db being a hackproof design for many applications well beyond currency.

Your point is valid, just not for the average user that does not want to think.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:41:34
Any specific reason why 15 years?

Why not? All they have to do is claim terrorists use that protocol/port etc... then ded from local ISP. Encrypted? Tor? buh bye for the average user.
Never say never.

I feel that it is not ethical at all unless stated specifically in TOS. I will not use a wallet that charges a hidden fee.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:41:29
Of course, but I'm asking about an additional fee for the wallet devs.

I guess I'm expecting gratis to use the wallet itself, but from what I have seen it isn't always the case. I don't mind it if I know about it. But, if the fee appears out of nowhere and is tacked on to a vague range of fee values (high, medium, low) where high would be a better case to get into the next block - it seems very unethical to me. Whereas if they add a disclaimer adding a few satoshi's for dev and sustainability - I'm good with that.

Posting to make sure I understand it. A short is a bet that the price will go down to a specific point and the system automatically trades for you. If it reaches that low point by a specific date, you make Y - X in profit. If it does not go to that low level, you lose the original bet. A normal trade is profiting anything over your original purchase.
