I've heard a story about a hacker kid writing down his private key on a piece of paper and putting it in his pants. Mother does the laundry and 1000 btc is gone.

Deflation is intrinsically limited: There has not been a case of hyperdeflation (to my knowledge) because at some point people still have to buy bread and spend their money. 
The shift from an inflating currency to a fixed one might be rough but it will be better in the end.

I thought BC private keys where stored on their server encrypted, and only handled client-side in the browser?

As the article notes, it's unfortunately still not clear how crypto-securities such as counterparty assets should be regarded :/
Is it legal to sell crypto-equity?

"If you legally want to sell equity, you'll always have licenses". Ofcourse there are licenses. The key thing is how to sell equity options of any small amount to anonymous people. 
And also, selling equity is different from selling equity options (like YCombinator's [Simple Agreement for Future Equity]( but bought with bitcoin)
Btw, most of bitcoin funded projects are entirely based on trust without any legal binding, and this works fairly ok especially when the fundraisers are not anonymous and want to keep a clear name. But so far it only works when you raise money selling something other than equity 
I believe crypto equity has serious potential, but it needs to be legal so that people who are fundraising don't have to stay anonymous.

It doesn't actually have to be a country with good infrastructure though. As long as you can create a company there to sell your equity futures. Then that company can invest with the raised money in the actual working company.

So what if he was? He got paid to do something he liked. And you're attacking him in public why?

Possibly android phones with location + vpn

China is just noise though, google is blocked there so all you see is expats with a VPN

Sounds great but how do you hedge against crazy bitcoin drops?

This is not simple inflation. The miners are forced to sell because they need to pay for their electricity. It means you need to have 1M coming into the system every day to maintain the price.

I don't think bitcoin will be stable compared to fiat cash. Maybe stable compared to other commodities though. Fiat itself keeps being inflated so btc/usd will keep changing for example. 
I do agree about the impact on equity and real estate, the potential impact of btc is a bit too hyped perhaps

There will be many people who get rich just by holding crypto. I feel like sometimes people argue that bitcoin is some sort of tool that makes finance fair again for everyone, but i fail to see how. Some people will get poor, some will get rich. System mechanics change but it wont reduce income disparity for example
