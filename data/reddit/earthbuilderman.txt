Perhaps I am a bit hasty in calling them a scam company but I haven't heard a word from them whatsoever and it has made me skeptical about whether or not anyone is actually receiving my correspondence emails.  All the information I have is that I spent BTC on a product; received the email that confirmed payment; have not received any shipping notification; nor a product; and certainly no replies to my emails asking what's up.

Yes thank you. I received a reply from the same woman.  Def bullshit.

I found them on this sub right around the end of November.

I wanted to fairly update the situation.  After several attempts (5 total) to get the situation resolved.  Customer Service finally did and cancelled my order.  They asked for my address to refund to and yet failed to mention that they are sending in GoCoin and not BTC.  I still have not received a refund and am still dealing with customer service.  At least this is getting closer to being concluded.

Bitcoin core 0.7 I think.  I did the multiple backups already.  I am catching up on the block chain now.

Amazon sells them for almost $50 more than direct from trezor.io.  I bought two and no customs fees.
