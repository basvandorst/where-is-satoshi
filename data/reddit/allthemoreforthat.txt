Most western countries have universal healthcare. Am I missing something or are you just one of those people who are afraid of the world socialism and of societies oriented towards helping poor people?
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:45:35
So your argument is that with universal healthcare people will be banging on doctors' doors at night and demanding free service... 
Newsflash - doctors still get paid good money for their work. 
Again, in most civilized countries people have access to free or very cheap healtcare. What you're saying is that a rich person has more right to be alive than a poor person. If you have money - you can buy your health. If you're poor - then sorry you don't deserve to be alive as much. This is a completely inhumane view of the world, and I'm glad that people who think like that are a very small minority worldwide.

Using peerblock and a vpn should be good enough right?

Socialism advocates redistribution of wealth. Capitalism results in extreme centralization of wealth. You tell me which is better (not Socialism vs. Capitalism but redistribution vs centralization).

There are 1,769,207 movies in IMDB, there are about 10,000 titles in Netflix, you could maybe find 10,000 more if you subscribe to amazon prime, hulu, etc. So yeah, the majority of movies are "obscure" relative to what's widely available on the market today.

I don't understand your point, could you elaborate?

When talking about bitcoin - everyone was once an idiot just a few months or years ago. You too. In the beginning very few people knew about bitcoin and there weren't many resources, or people that would answer your questions, so you had to spend hours and days just to get some info. Now, there are tons of people who understand bitcoin, who have created these online communities, in order to help each other out and to introduce new people to cryptocurrencies. This here is for everybody, with a focus on the beginners. There are much more advanced forums for experts. Don't forget - the future of bitcoin lies in the hands not only of the developers and the big investors, but just as much in the people who are just now starting to hear about bitcoin. It is better to have stupid questions than no questions at all. And it's best if we answer them, because that increases curiosity, motivation, knowledge, and thus decreases the barriers to entry. I understand your frustration  but it does nobody any good when bitcoin supporters attack each other for no good reason. Just ignore next time, please. These posts don't reach the front page so they shouldn't bother you that much.

I preventively closed my account because of their suspicious policies regarding bitcoin. I'm with a credit union now, much better. I advise everyone to do the same.

The map is incorrect. Bulgaria is gray, should be green.

They don't mention it nearly as much as they should.

Not really relevant.

He's such a great guy, I really admire him!

Nice job supporting other bitcoiners and the community, asshole. Just shut the fuck up, when you have nothing useful to say. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 04:24:58
They should "investigate" the dollar then.
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:33:28
Or the one after that.

Never buy bitcoin with a loan. It may be no-interest but you still have to pay it off. If the price crashes you're screwed.

The roots of this saying are older than the digital clock. That's why the correct way to say it is "twice a day". If you say "once" it makes sense of course, so you are right, too.

@_date: 2014-04-02 20:48:28
It's actually right twice a day.

So we keep silent and not call the trumps in life out?

Never too late to buy in. The fact that you missed a few $$ doesn't mean you can't make more.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:58:56
I would buy now at a minor loss and not sell in the future to try to make minor gains.  Trying to play the dips can lose a fortune, just HODL.

Thank you! All 3 confirmations went through an hour after submitting it.

10k by the end of december?That's very pessimistic, we're almost there now. My bet is we'll be at 15k by the end of December.

Are you trolling or are you stupid? Every country has a constitution.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:42:09
Can you please explain what that means?

Thank you

Russel brand is an activist, he would definitely do to spread awareness and fight the system.

I just send them an email demanding an official position. Will post the answer here.
