This was a finalist in Coinbase's hackathon.

Well I guess you can stop waiting because they already have frames for them.

Why trust any of the data from their API? In the end, how do you know you're being fed *authentic* blockchain data? Concerning their "tx propagation metric", why not just keep a graph of the transactions their nodes have already seen? Instead, they're current method seems rather spammy: crawling nodes, asking for a mempool dump, then disconnecting.

Thanks for such a comprehensive response!

Don't think that app has been implemented fully,  that was a concept request on one of the watch face websites. I've made a version myself, but haven't got around to the graph yet.

The "buy with bitcoin" link is tiny as fuck. They should put up a click able logo like the other payment options.

Ah, I was mistaken. Was a little foolish of myself to assume no one else has seen the concept and taken a crack at it!

Only a fool parts with a substantial amount of money at such a whim.

How does this handle revocation? Also this promotes address reuse which is very harmful. Bitcoin addresses aren't at all like IP addresses, they are meant to be one time use only. If you're not generating a new address for every payment you're doing it wrong and leaking your privacy along the way. People need to start thinking of addresses as simply payment identifiers rather than an identity itself.

It uses the Javascript API for configuration and polling, so it's mobile OS agnostic.
