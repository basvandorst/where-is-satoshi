Not being incompatible isn't the same as to gain from the effect of being compatible. 
Or are you saying that non updated wallets can make efficient segwit transactions out of nothing and have 40% lower fees without code changes? Or are miners allowed to just magically remove witness data and place it into another data-structure without invalidating my old tx? How about receiving and spending a segwit transaction with an old wallet? How exactly can an old wallet spend a Pay-to-Witness TX?
@_date: 2016-04-11 07:32:06
Sigh. So you say:
- there will be no halving
- old wallets can make segwit transaction and, more importantly, can spend segwit outputs
- LN is operationally and widely spread today
If you disagree on one of the above points start by arguing my first points instead of reflexive calling others 


Update: maybe take a look at this:

Calm down. The way you guys tend discuss things is the one of the reasons why this place is so poisoned. In case you didn't noticed, the link I posted is actually a pro-Core Segwit article. If there is false claims, then  go and write to the author.

They are a free acting instance, nobody is forcing them to build miners or to sell them when and for what price or not or to use them for whatever purpose. Its the exact definition of a free market, since no violence or force is involved.
@_date: 2016-04-11 07:42:23
I think I understand the concept. The change outputs will be segwits as long as the other one has not updated. But then what is wrong about my initial point: 


Additionally I see big risk in: 


@_date: 2016-04-10 19:33:09
The Facts:
- reward halving is around the corner, most possibly leading to a higher blockspace demand just like we saw the last times and on the more popular altcoins.
- segwit will only start to have a positive effect once enough wallets are updated.
- there is still no LN, and even if it would, it will need time to get adopted by the market.
Sorry , we still don't have any blockspace improvements whereas a simple uncontroversial 2MB HF, for which we have broad support, would have done the job. 
There are several explanations on why letting a multi Billion $ experiment running into a simple technically avoidable situation like this. None of them has to do with decentralization or protecting Bitcoin. **If you really want to help Bitcoin, start to make it look like it will not fail when demand surges.**

There was this 1Mb limitation, right?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:08:36
As long as nobody is forced to do anything against their will/free choice, no property right is harmed and no natural human right is violated. Clearly none of these points are violated by the fact that AntPool is arbitrarily and unilaterally missing out on fees, thus making the remaining blockspace fees higher that other miner can then collect. Where is that not a free market?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:44:54
*serious shit
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:21:54
because free market
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:09:59
If AntPool wants to miss out on fees by free choice, the remaining free market will correct that eventually, hence: a free market. Nobody forces them to not serve us, which is their natural born right.

yes thats nice, but it's not the whole truth... if you get a tax investigation they may ask if you have done onchain transactions (taxable event) besides the 'proofs' you are referring to (i.e. CSVs from exchanges). 
I recommend any German citizen to privately keep track of all your xpubkeys (and thus onchain spendings). If they have reason to believe that your coins are not 'truly older than a year' you may get charged flat 45% tax charges at best.
Keep a list of your xpubkeys, your paper wallets if any, addresses you did donations and gifts (non-taxable), your exchange/services deposit-addresses (because they are in CSVs)... just in case. All remaining outgoing transactions must be taxable events per definition and will be treated as such. Incoming transactions (that are not backed by exchanges CSV files) will and must be treated as "you bought some BTC" events.
If you have questions pm me...

not yet, I can keep you updated once its hostet on github.io  ... it is a pure javascript client side only thing, because im not interested in anyones financials. Currently it supports: bitcoin.de, kraken, xapo, bitwa.la .. im right now working on on-chain tx as described in my post.

Im writing a tool that does all of this automagically for you. Just input CSVs, pukeys and excluded addresses (donations and deposit addresses).

The max Quantum QBits that have been operated yet are multiple dimensions away of being able to solve a sha256 hash.

Yes, but think twice!
For some "strange" reason we see anything just fleeing/breathing into the Dollar. All the "minor" Fiat currencies are now in this mode. This is probably because of the fear factor of a herd starting to run towards an imaginary safe haven.
Thing is, when you own Bitcoin, you are absolutely NOT safe against inflation in terms of market fear/exchange rates, just in terms of money supply. The Russians are just about to learn this lesson now. The Russian money supply is far from being increased, actually its decreased, but ppl run away. This is a loss in trust. At least they dont run into Bitcoin (yet).
Now when TSHTF, all comes down to anybody just want something to eat and heat. Bitcoin wont help you there, thats why we see a Dollar rally in the endgame of the Fiat itself. People do not realize yet that the Dollar is not safe and will turn into hyperinflation after all but only AFTER the rest died into the Dollar. Funny, eh?
Maybe Bitcoin will be cool after all, but it may well be that you have to wait until the rest of the planet finally realizes that Fiat is money from hell.

Ppl need to realize that Bitcoin will be the reason why the concept of "government" will stop to work.

Initially, the ETF would have two coins after a fork. So if it has to decide for one side, it can (and will) sell the other... Thus having big influence on what the 'main' chain will be, or will become...

Only because its called "technical possible attack" doesn't mean its feasible and as destructive as the amount of required investment would justify. 
Anyway, for me it will be the biggest buying opportunity :)
If this attack will ever take place, the mining monopoly scenario is a bit scary, because it would force out commercial miners, thus harming the integrity of the chain if not stopped at a certain point.

Let's better keep the blocksize limited, so we cannot gain market share on stock trading, digital rights management, identity services and all the other wonderful stuff where Bitcoin can make industries depend onto.. To increase fees when its really big and profitable for all of us.

BIP106 is something different than max(blocksize) := FACTOR*AVERAGE.

Also shifting the same problem to the future again. Hard Forks need to be made wisely (we all agree in that). This also means that we have to make sure we need none in the future.

separate your coins first by making the first transaction on the lower fee chain (BU?) wait until settled. Make this second TX on the higher fee chain (BC?) that 'overrides' the probably still unsettled copy of your first TX to make it into another block. If everything worked your split. If not, start over again until it is.
Should work in most cases in the first try.

Reality. 
Why do you think Core has or should have the power to force anyone running its software proposal? If they don't come up with a proposal that will gain consensus than its just their personal waste of time. Core spokesmen have done a very good job dividing the community. Now a change in consensus cannot be found easily anymore. Which leads to default: no change. Which is a good thing.
The miners will run whatever serves their interest best. Otherwise the i.e. FED could come and some Software 'update'. If Core wants ppl to run their stuff they have to build their software in a way that serves anyones need, not just their agenda.
Its really nice to see how good and strong Nakamoto consensus works.

Of course technically 2 Mb works, but thats not the point. If we go from 1Mb to 2Mb we will surely go from 2Mb to 4Mb because we have had the precedence... and so on until at maybe 128Mb it doesn't work anymore.
So its not about the blocksize same as nobody questions 1500Byte Ethernet MTU today and yet still the internet still works faster than 1985... because of third layer scaling.
Blockchains (onchain) are two-way broadcast media. You cannot scale broadcast two-way media to global scale. The continouse developement and scale of such systems have ever been done by third layer protocols. Whats BGP/TCP/IP for the (Ether)Internet will be  Lightning for 1Mb PoW chain.
Think of Bitcoin as an old fashioned 1990 broadcast ethernet hub where everyone is connected to and everyone uses the same limite media. The way to scale is, is not to let 4 billion people connect to the same broadcast hub, but to implement BGP routing between them.

@_date: 2017-01-09 09:33:48
Okay I meant "backed" in a way that describes what its value is derived from. Whichs is not the traditional meaning of the word "backing". The point is that you do not need to have backing in order to have value. As long as scarcity and usability (among other unique features) are not violated, Bitcoin is guaranteed to have value because it is guaranteed to have demand while being scarce.
A virtual thing cannot and must not be backed by anything. And this is an advantage. It can always be exchanged by gold or any other asset, just not by a fixed exchange rate. This gives a lot of room to the upper limit of value for Bitcoin as a pure virtual thing ;)
If it would be backed by something, lets say by an ounce of gold. The total market cap of Bitcoin would not exceed 21Mil Ounces or say ~20Bil$ for the foreseeable future. I would see that as a big disadvantage.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:35:57

Its very shady to only have 2 confirmations on a 1% hashrate chain that can easily be target of double spends and 51% attacks. Additionally, they dont ask for details, all you need is an email address. On top of that they dont seem to care for their own daily withdrawl limits...
However, it works :)

Its backed by scarcity and usability.
as long as its more scarce than Fiat money or even Gold (approx 1-2% psyical Inflation due to mining), and as long as it can be used without banks or registration instantaneously and globally, it will have demand and thus value.
It cant and must not be backed by anything physical because that would violate its decentralization and the thing that its value is derived from.

because the road to hell is paved with good intentions, 1MB has to be the limit once and for all.
And because of enough people think the way I do, no matter how much noise and spam the big block crowd will be doing, there will always be the 1MB chain... And the 1MB chain will be superior to the petty big block hard forks in the long run because it will be the first that establishes LN on a broad scale because of economic incentive.

Do you have evidence for your claim that ~100% BU miners are paid by R.Ver. ?
BU Hashrate has been rising recently from ~15% to about ~18%. Probably at least some of the remaining 60% will also switch to BU.
So either SegWit changes its activation threshold to max 75% (without loosing its support), or Core and BU team should start working on a compromise, because otherwise nothing will happen at all... which is not a bad thing btw.
@_date: 2017-01-20 13:14:58
Tell me how is your SegWit 95% proposal coming along?
The reason your feel pissed is because you want others to have your opinion. I'm glad the Nakamoto consensus is not that easy to break.
Edit: btw belive it or not, Im a SegWit supporter and even run a SegWit node (an no BU). But also I do not want Bitcoin to be easily controlled by anyone. We need working on consensus instead about fighting about heads and ideologies. So I go wherever the consensus takes us. Currently I don't think SegWit will be activated in its current form.

In this particular example, your right. I did the test and couldn't find any other online resources about Indian authorities confiscating gold by knocking from door to door (as described in this article).
I was only able to find some info about that authorities now can have the right to seize gold exceeding certain amounts if the holder is not able to declare its origin. But none of this sources was writing about this already happening, and surely not at a wide scale.
There is some serious shit going on in India and their currency right now. But claiming that they are already going from door to door to confiscate gold is simply not true (yet).

Yes, but for this about to happen there has to be onchain transaction volume on an altcoin magnitudes higher than currently on i.e. Litecoin.
Offchain volume is currently 99% done by exhanges for nothing but greed rather than usage.
As long as people so not start using Altcoins for real transaction, there won't be pressure on these Altcoins to change their limit either and therefore these coins won't simply have the need to "take over".

Yes indeed, A successful consensus will be a extremely bullish factor. The sellers either don't understand what consensus forking means and how it strengthens the currency, or they understand that others don't understand it and try to gain from the panic in between (bigger fool).
Bitcoin will araise from the ashes more robust and future proof. And the Altcoins will have a huge problem as they cant implement BIP101 not now nor any time soon!! They can only try to implement a moving average blocksize limit.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:35:20
Uh. That censoring again.
Since the average Joe hasn't been given any other options than to use XP to show his favor for bigger blocks than 1MB, your statement is pretty much a side notice.
The core team is not doing anyone a favor by not implementing any consensus vote mechanism into its releases and simply dictating the future of their version of bitcoin.
Knowing that, I truly hope that any other source branch will take over eventually to reduce their power which they are abusing right now. 
If it turns out to be XP fine. If its something else, also fine. If this will eventually corrupt the same way core did, we will handle it just as this time.
Not supporting any change or even the debate in blocksize (which currently means using core), will result in a 95% loss of value in Bitcoin because most if not all Bitcoin investors thought the limit will be removed/raised if required.

Exactly. Do not overestimate the power of the miners. They will have to live with what we want Bitcoin to be, because otherwise they can't sell us their version of Bitcoin.
Sure the miners prefer BIP100 over BIP101 as it gives them more power. Put the mining business aside, there is a lot of support for BIP101 from the economy itself. All the majorPayment processors for example want BIP101 as it gives them growth certainty. They don't want the miners to cripple their business case.

Because they have a 99% unused blockchain. Implementing BIP101 would result in making them voulnerable to exact the kind of attack that the 1MB limit was introduced few years ago.
In order for an Altcoin to get past the blocksize limit it will have to implement a different BIP now (i.e. moving everage or BIP100) or BIP101 when the altcoins blockchain reaches its limit.

You wouldnt sell to Fiat money when you have acces to someone else account. You would try to get btc out.
Using Fiat dump would be dumbest idea in terms of traceability and economic loss. That guy just toasted like 150,000 USD or more.
My guess is that someone tried to push down markets before the next race. And because BTCe is rather illiquid on the shortlist of important exchange markets, it has had the most 'visual' affect.

Sure most Bitcoiners (including me) don't want this. But if Bitcoin is not capable of processing transactions for everyday persons (which it currently does not), and the community is not able to find a quick solution to this, the market will find a working for this malfunction.

We should have some standard in most Wallets to have a urgent/emergency fee calculation based on the last blocks. Also a resend option using higher fees if a transaction get stuck due to spamming like this.
These issues will get **worse** since Bitcoin is going mad on not raising the blocksize and now anyone want (still?) Bitcoin because Euro is breaking apart...

Finally a sane investor understanding the nature of fiat disease. First comes the fever ('deflation') then comes death (hyperinflation). Its not because of Bitcoin, its because of the mindset of the slaved masses that will drive them towards literally printed paper before the big bang.
Anyway, we don't know when things will start to really speed off, Bitcoin will continue its path of fiat-hyperdeflation until then. Actually, its happening since 10 years already.

Regarding this I'm not really talking about BTC protocol. Spamming the chain using higher fee is currently a valid "usecase". Its the client wallets that need to be able to react.
Currently there are transaction stucked for more than 5 hours that have fees inplace but are just tapped out because of the onging spam with a fee of twice the "priority" fee. 
Again, Average Joe does not know the protocol nor the software. If his transactions get stuck, the system gets useless to him. This attack can go on for days easily to  a point where any wiretransfer will be faster. Thus showing anyone that got excited about crypto currencies in the last days: This is not really a solution.

Replay protection is not related to this issue,  as splitting coins is easy either via fee or RBF directly.

Since nobody is doing something illegal, there will be no punishment.
Publicly "misinterpreting" some ICO related announcement to cause havoc in the marked is not illegal, since its plausible deniable that they simple "overstated" or "misinterpreted" the ICO related announcement and are carefully closing down own business, without causing any harm to other people on purpose.
Of course since they are the only one knowing about this "strategy" in advance, in a very overbought, fear-seeking market... this will work out very well. ... It is just very fishy.

If there is no other solution:
1. Make a tiny/zero fee TX (i.e 0-10 sat / byte) to yourself on the chain with the most free block space (probably B2X).
2. Wait a couple of blocks until it confirms.
3. If/When that TX gets replayed (Check with Blockexplorer) Reset and Sync your Bitcoin Wallet so it does not see this probably not unconfirming replayed TX.
4. Make a double spend TX of your own money to a different address of yours having a proper fee on the tighter chain (probably BTC).
5. Repeat until succesful
@_date: 2018-07-06 10:33:14
But now you can pay in Lightning also, so fee wouldnt be a problem ... 
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:08:11
Yes its true, Bitcoins adaptation (not technically) faces several problems.
Volatility isn't the biggest if it would be volatility in both directions equally. I think the one year downtrend volatility is problematic, but also required to get coins better distributed in the Bitcoin universe/economy. Bitcoin is a perfect store of Bitcoin itself, but not in terms of purchasing power value.
Then we are facing issues where conventional banking industry, government and also mainstream meadia is trying to downplay Bitcoin or produce false information about it. So this is an active issue that cannot really be solved by Bitcoin itself, we have rely on the fact that we are stronger in terms of willpower.
and, and, and... but its far from from hopeless :D

Exactly. That Private Manning was definitely no PsyOp. We know that because he had little media attention, the severe disclosures got downplayed, there have not been any consequences nor a real public discussion, he lost everything and went to jail. Simple as that.
Nobody wants to get fooled and one is peeved of by it if it happened, this is normal and understandable. But still, anyone that believes in Snowden, believes in a pushed up MSM story with little to no real disclosures and/or fake MS Powerpoint docs from the "NSA". We all need to learn to identify distractions and distinct them from real important events.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:54:55
Hes right that this reduces transaction time to almost zero. BUT, aside security concerns, theres another big issue that the sender needs to have the correct ammount of money on a private key already in place and confirmed by the network. This is very unlikely to be practical solution to reduce transaction speed unlees for emergency funds to privately known persons.

What would be the reason for either side not to proceed with their agenda. Even if (and I doubt that) one side will back down, there will still be supporters that will run the chains of both camps, as the software is already developed and in use for both sides.
The 1Mb crowd will not give in for sure, as if it comes down to this there will be people (like me) that keep running the 1MB consensus.
The 2x crowd will not give in, as they already invested too much in propaganda and some software development to keep on running their thing.

I would like to see a more detailed game theoretical analysis of what is likely to happen (long run) when replacing energy costs by manufacturing costs.
There are several immideate consequences that are not mentioned, i.e. the fact that hashrate will never be able to adjust downwards (for economic reasons), or the fact that it becomes economically stupid to sell mining equipment in the first place because it will always be smarter to just run it yourself. And, if there is nobody that sells equipment for that reason, wouldnt it be a complete centralization at the manufacturing level?  ... And so on.
Finally, I am quite confident that the system will still converge to Enegry costs using the most engery efficient hardware (just at a later point in time, similary to the fact that there is no such thing as ASIC resistance). Once enough Hardware is deployed so that hashrate is so high that building new becomes infeasible. At this point we are back to where we stared: PoW Engery

Well first of all, that day has not come yet. And it really depends on where we stand then when we approach the reward halving. 
The mining profitability is kinda like a soft buffer zone for the Bitcoin price. The price cannot go below it very easily without some miners throwing the towel.
A) We are close to mining non-profitabilty (like nowadays) the the price will probably go up (slightly), because it reduces the selling pressure of commercial miners, that need to stop mining, if price doesnt go up (enough).

PHILOSOPHY: The invention of the Blockchain will rewrite the way we write history by utilizing proof of existence on key documents and historical evidence! Ultimately, it will also change the way we think.
One smart guy said: absence of evidence will become evidence of absence!
In terms of written hitory, after bC. and aC. There will be bB. and aB.
@_date: 2015-04-05 18:15:14
The exact order and the content of documents is proven by math on any timestamp in future history. Much historic manipulation resolves when the order and content is clear. This is a uniqe and very important improvement that the world did not have prior to 2009. Dont underestimate it because the content itself is still "unproven".
When applied consistent (frequently without gaps), transparent (public archives)
 and precise (detailed) it makes false claims much harder especially to the party that has no blockchain proof the time when actual events occured.
The real kicker however is, when one party uses a closed archive so that the manipulating party is not in knowledge what data has existence proof of the other party... in this situation the manipulatin party is easily caught "lying" when the constructed evidence clearly contradicts existence-proven-documents (of a blockchain hash) in timing, order and content. (Im not a native speaker, thus its a bit hard for me to explain)
So it all comes down that fake evidence is hard to construct in a consistent way.

I think BTC does not need a collapse in order to thrive. In fact, a non violent transition will be better in many ways.
- It will give the users the chance to learn about it rather than be thrown into the hot water.
- It will create a sustainable economic basement, rather than some kind of emergency panic currency
- The Internet will more likely survive a non total collapse (though I think it will survive anyway).
- A steady transition will enable Bitcoin holders today tremendous chances in building a better future.
- The Blockchain has a chance to grow into the required usage/load over time. A 1000% increase in usage from one day to another could kill it (super high transaction fees, coins locked up, ...)
- And most importantly, less people suffer. Its easy to call them sheeple, but personally I don't want anybody to suffer for things they have been tricked into. I am pretty sure there are a lot of sheeple in any of our families as well...

Basically, you meet up with some guys that already did it and they verify your "existenceship" by signing your documents using their private keys. Then you have some docs (birth docs, photos, ...) hashed into the blockchain. That way the existence is a public ledger.

Then what defines 'reaching consensus' in your view other than ppl using a different SW feature? How do users/miners/exchanges/... express 'consensus' so that you feel/hear/evaluate it? If you come to the conclusion that it is about using i.e. a certain different implementation, than you see that the ppl that are disallowing discussion about alternative implementations are working against consensus itself.
Consensus cannot be find by talking on reddit, mailing lists or Bitcoin conferences, because nobody has a proper 'definition of done' in this process. It can only be find by users expressing their vote by using alternative implementations.

Disallowing discussion about hardfork is disallowing discussion about consensus itself. Because hardforking is key element in Bitcoins consensus model.
@_date: 2015-11-30 17:01:16


May I try: BitcoinXT rebroadcasts double spends and marks them accordingly. This makes RBF obsolete since 0-confirmation schemes only have to wait like ~10 seconds network delay to get in knowledge of any double spend attempt. And it also works reliable with ~10% of the nodes being XT nodes.  Thus, Bitcoin Core is actually solving a non-issue already. 
Second try: Its generally better for the overall protocol to have a competition on alternative clients and features in a opensource environment. Imagine we would all be using Microsoft Internetexplorer today because we were fearful that using Firefox or Chrome damages the consensus of how HTML should look like.
And finally: If your version of Bitcoin needs a common core for everyone on order to function properly, with a closed group of people having commit access and another certain group of people managing all the allowed discussion on that, than your version of Bitcoin is already dead. If Bitcoin Core doesn't open up, it will vanish sooner or later. I can 100% guarantee that by looking at the history of opensource projects, protocols and other proprietary technology. Core developers and 'moderators' will end up loosing all their power if they keep fighting consensus. 
So lets start discussing like adults without the fear on alternate opinions.

Considering the Blocksize will never increase, LN will be the only viable consumer way to transact. If the chain gets blocksize bumps HF all the time, there will be no mainstream adoption for LN, because there is a viable, easier, less complex way to transact (onchain), thus no LN.
With 1MB blocks, the LN Bitcoin node operators get incentivized for LN payment routing that can than pay the extraodinary onchain fees.  Win, Win, Win... no HF ever.

No mention of the FED? So wheres that fraud thing I was told about?
@_date: 2015-10-25 12:30:04


Being right were the majority turns out to be wrong is where the biggest chances in life are.
A hypothetical Fedcoin's full reserve will not eliminate systemic risk when there's still trust required to use their money. It just shifts the risks from users trying to withdraw their (non-existent) deposits to a 'we can and have to devalue your money' to guarantee financial stability, thus causing again a lack of trust.
'Permissioned' Fedcoins and private bank coins cannot not be build upon a public accessible, non-permissive, proof of work algorithms. Instead, they will rely on a series/chain of private secret certificates and a central authority that frequently 'publishes' the next valid block of transactions. This offers a series nice features over Bitcoin but has tremendous drawbacks when it comes to trust, security, censorship... and personal freedom in the end. 
In order for fractional and/or centralized banking systems to work, trust is required. Since the value of 'money' is defined by its 'users', a lack of trust can always and instantaneously render the value of fractional reserve 'money' to precisely zero. Regardless the fact that the majority of people still dreams the Keynesian illusion, this is what to the day happened at the end of ANY former centralized currency. Thinking this will not happen nowadays is ignoring reality and human history.
Sure, a spontaneous lack of trust also applies also to Bitcoin, but the reasons for this cannot be economically/political/personal failure any more, rather than only technical (as long as you don't make the Keynesian mistake to use your exchange as a bank). There are good reasons we tend to call the technological automation of things: 'increased productivity' or 'human progress'.

They won't. Turning off the miners would be very stupid to them now, especially since they have a positive cash flow.
The bankruptcy filing was a preliminary measure due to uncertainty of the market and high costs for the new datacenter.
So what does it mean? We have to wait. Anything can happen, normal operation, new investors and also turn off anything (after their mining equipment gets negative turnaround).
Imho. the most likely thing is that the price keeps rising due to the halving and they will keep up business as usual. Or maybe they continue with additional VC money to complete the datacenter. Who knows...

Thats absolutley right. However, in the very far future we might (want) to see a obligatory fee relative to the transaction volume. Maybe some formular. That would be even simpler as todays solution.

We have to wait some weeks and see how the halving, potentional new investor/money or a graceful shutdown will work out for them.
However if price keeps rising like recently, nothing will happen except that they now have to pay half the employee payroll.

I think whey cant find a way without making it perfectly obviously the same scam as the Fiat system itself. Probably some decentralized system with each participating (central) bank having their own master keys to controle the ammount of &gt;DEBT&lt;, because that's what it is about when they want to make something that pleases the current system.

Only thing that makes some sense to me is that ViaBTC is in deep trouble getting BTC... maybe they ran out of because of margin or stuff like Gox did.
This way they sell their locked split token coins to 'smart' people that want to sell their BCC but take thei BTC hostage for whatever purpose.

A hardfork is only going to happen if the user literally buy into it. Meaning, unless there is a really good reason for this, any hardfork attempt is absolutely not going to be successful.
No matter how hard miners try and how much noise they make, they cant change the nature of Bitcoin's economic incentives.
Im totally relaxed that the 2x part of their SegWit version is not happening any time soon, if ever.

Since I believe in technological progress, my best guess is that SHA256 hashers will be the first ultra high speed optical ASICs.

maybe, but this time the price will go up wafter a major exchange crash :D

I totally get your point. 
But also, without the sheeple realizing their misery there will be no end to the current Fiat Ponzi Scheme.
There will not be a non-violent way out of this (for them).
So don't fight reality by thinking ppl are not ignorant and foolish.
If it means that the new 1% should share their new wealth to their local communities: this is quite a different story :D

Not only that, but its also gaining hashrate recently.
From 50PHs up to 70PHs in three weeks or so.

hmmm.. that kinda implies that Jihan is looking forward to making shure the SegWit2x transition does not run smoothly compatible with BIP148 UASF as it is planned.
otherwise there would be no reason to even care about UASF...

A Lot of ppl do not realize the impact of this. Finally a exchange is fully integrated into conventional banking network, because trading Bitcoin now will result in a immediate change of balance in a users bank account and not some franctional reserve Bitcoin exchange account.

Its just Fiat trolls trying to make moar funny money. The Honeybadger doesnt care...

This is so nonsense. I'm totally looking forward for people to leave the Bitcoin ship to follow the miners version of their central planning corporate BTC. Lets get over those get quick rich, miners have political influence, we dont understand economics, dont understand multi layer scaling, need blockspace now or else kiddies.
The problem is: they wont go without us, otherwise they already did. They want us to believe their shitty understanding of how decentralization works. 
Or to put it otherwise: There are only two kinds of people, the one that want to be left alone and the ones that never let you!
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:42:57
Sure they can try, but if the only thing that keeps them in power is our believe in their "money"... 
@_date: 2015-03-24 07:54:16
Thats awesome! As a Bitcoiner: Thank you.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:42:48
Left open for interpretation by intention. I wouldn't want to tell my opinion aside the fact that the price range gets closer each day now.
We can see that we hit resistance and support several times _very_ precisely over a _long_ period. And the interval the bounces occur goes down as well as the trading volume first spiked and now eases out.
Everything of the above said is a good indicator that volatility is about to rise...
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:57:05
Don't underestimate the enemy. Saurons Eye cateched up on Bitcoin. We'd better pay attention.

Banks have fractional reserves by their very design and sheeple still use it. So having Fidor/BTCde coupling close brings two exisitng and working worlds closer together. And regarding fractional exchanges: let them go down along with the greed of their users. Better for the rest of us.
For me its just a convinient way of purchasing coins to get them into my own cold storage.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:27:21
I think they can drive down the price indefinetly if they want to and do it carefully. Only thing they have to make sure to net get broke aboute it ist the arbitrage trades dont exceed their gains. 
And this should be easy enough regarding the fact that very few ppl make arbitrage USD -&gt; Yuan, because its not practical.
They learned from the MtGox fiasco, driving the price up artificially leads to fractional reserve and eventually you get bankrupt. Now they drive down and when they do it carfully no one can stop them as long as all the noobs sell their real coins on real exchanges, they can get them there for cheap :D
Same happens to the gold and silver market for years now...

Since we are at a literacy level, you know that, as Mieses stated, the world economy can run on any amount of sound money. The whole sum is irrelevant. The economy can literally run on a single coin and we exchange atoms. Gold inflated because it was good money, which values it high which increased its supply because entrepreneurs were incentivized in producing more of it. This cant happen to Bitcoin.


Nope, but because you advocate for selflessly surrendering oneself to government enforced inflation. On the advent of better alternatives, this has become a bad, self destructive choice.
@_date: 2015-03-28 12:08:20
Totally not as it forgets data after several month. Also having a blockchain version would transparently integrate things like changetip in a decentralized way.

If true, this would be a good sign as it confirms that the miners are rejecting non-SW blocks.
But I think its just a bug on the page...
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:19:23
Its rational. In the long run Bitcoin will drive out fiat-currencies anyway, just because its more assertive, resilient and socially scalable. Just like gold was driven out by fiat-currencies as it wasn't globally scalable while maintaining decentralization and exposed to weaknesses bound to its physicality. Something gold-bugs can't admit easily.
Most people, which are no "hodlers of last resort", can't see this yet as they are struggling with cognitive dissonance regarding their perception of value and authority. Also, there is no widespread knowledge about the functionality and history of money. Infact, there is only widespread ignorance, misconceptions and keynesian propaganda.
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:54:04
If there is no conscious observer, there is no physicality of things.
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:25:06
Yes, but as you said... for larger ammounts it will still be feasible to do onchain settlement... until it isnt anymore.
Incentives are that LN will continue to drive out the businesscase for onchain transaction other than LN channel setup. This is because LN can handle available blockspace much more effectively.
This displacement of regular onchain TX will go on until there will be almost only LN settlement TX left, I dont see a reason why it would not unfold like that in the long term future, do you?

Security by obscurity gives only false security. Using it in combination with real scientific bulletproof security does not increase the level of security, because theres no need for obscurity per definition. Hence it is commonly used by sheeple to hide the flaws of non perfect security in the first place.
Therefore it does more harm than good. EVER

You do realize that all of your examples, including others prominent ones like the USD and EUR have lost against Bitcoin the last 10,8,6,4,2 years like ~1000% each or so. Its not about replacing Fiat, its about making obsolete. 'Replacing' would be developing to a situation where the state adopts Bitcoin it as reserve currency to print their own new Fiat on it, collecting taxes in their crypto backed funny money. Making obsolete is getting into a situation without authority over money. In essence, a situation without a central bank.


Because consumerism sucks and is bad for the environment. Inflationary Fiat debt moneys inherently are bad for the planet and humans, as they incentivize consumerism and wars. If you can't see this, I am really sorry for you.
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:18:37
I think Mr. Sherman made his argument in such a counter productive way, that it became obvious to the public not only that Bitcoin is a problem for the status quo, but also a solution to anyone else.
The fact that they publicly admit they have a problem with it, without being able to stop it the last 10 years speaks volumes.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:30:24

Hashrate follows Price. SegWit has 80-90%  communit, user and economic support.
Since when did Hashrate define policy? Lets find out if they mine their worthless 2MB+SW HF chain or the one that holds value.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:40:41
Now we get to the point. So you say you don't like deflationary moneys, because their wide spread adoption would degrade your assets.
Please ask yourself: Why is it you need third parties (the the central bank, the states power, keynesian propaganda, ...) to enforce inflationary currencies on other people that might not have as many assets as you and might not believe the same things you do?
Further ask yourself: If your assets value and your 'net-worth' relies on enforcing inflationary measures, how valuable are your assets actually?

@_date: 2017-06-19 13:55:26
As long as we all remember that it was the UASF that made them change their mind... I don't really care how SegWit gets activated only that it gets activated.
Their stupid 2MB HF 2 month later is a completely different story though.

Until it isn't. A chain that has more value compared to its hashrate will attract miners.

Bitcoin has hashrate because it has users that pay for it because its decentralized...

Except people that took the free choice and opted out of government inflationary fiat. The world ran on deflationary money (gold) for centuries. But its your choice to stay in Inflation, if you believe thats good for you. Please dont try to convince others though.
