"Nakamoto". Admittedly, a subtle joke :)

Good idea! Also, "withstanding" a house fire isn't enough. You also have to be able to locate it in the rubble, and an RFID chip would help with that.

What will explode is commonplace exploitation of lenders on these platforms.

True, good point. But that option has its own set of effects too.

Has anyone ever seen a president showcase a signed order like that? It's like he's totally lining it up for the mememakers.

Another theory: he carefully analyzed his end-of-life wealth strategy, and decided that his preference would be for his coins to become worthless. In light of the considerable wealth, this can be viewed as "donating" his wealth to bitcoin.

You have to think how different Facebook could've been if they had been at the helm all these years.

Pft! Harvard schmarvard. Vice.com clearly said that bitcoin will fail.

Do we know who actually claimed the bounty?

Any developments that were previously hindered by bitcoin's unestablished reputation can now be re-analyzed. That's everything from the implementation of additional highly-regulated financial instruments, to Grandma wanting to buy one of them bitcoins because it's not just for hackers anymore.
