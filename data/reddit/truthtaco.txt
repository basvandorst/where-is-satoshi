Forcing someone to use it could make them dislike it. But are you really asking why when your name is FreeMarketAnarchist? 
edit: Does no one else see the irony in forcing someone to use a free market currency?

I think it's in Paypals terms of use not to buy anything like Bitcoin with Paypal. And it probably says that specifically in small text somewhere during the checkout process.

The dollar is extremely stable compared to Bitcoin right now. This is not subjective it's a fact. 
Lets assume you work for a non Bitcoin related company. 80% of your employees would prefer to have dollars, but your company only offers Bitcoin, and you don't see anything wrong with this situation? Bitcoin could easily go down in the time it takes them to convert it, if they even know how. Are you really so obsessed with being on the Bitcoin bandwagon that you can't see things objectively? It would be a stupid move by the company in most situations.

You should apply your free market principles and your anarchist beliefs to the parent child situation. 
In the case of a government and a citizen, governments have authority over citizens and often force citizens to accept or use their currency. Kids are born into a family of no choice of their own, and have to submit to a parents authority. If you were an "anarchist" parent it would only make sense that you would want to have a light touch and use as little authority as possible, and give your children as much freedom as you can. On one side we have governements that are very "my way or the highway" and on the otherhand you have the free market and anarchy which attempt to give freedom of choice. Which of these does the OP's post sound like to you? I'm sorry if I can't explain it any more simply. 
But for the most part its just a douchbag thing to do and as I already pointed out, it's likely anyone doing this is just going to make their kids dislike bitcoin. Great job mission accomplished. A good alternative would be to give your kids whatever amount you were planing to from the start in allowance in what they want (probably usd). Then you could always give them some bitcoin on the side, and then it benefits them to learn how to use it.

It is very easy to build services on top of bitcoin, and the market is very competitive. So while it may not be out and in place *right now* it seems like it would be.... rather easy to set up a third party system that works with bitcoin and lets people buy and sell bitcoin via SMS for a very small fee that would still be a lot less than what is being used now. Is bitcoin taking over third world countries right now? No. Does it have potential to move into the market in the next few years? yes. 
Ease of use, and security aspects can all be done via third party. Bitcoin is rather new and over time ease of use and security will improve. That said you don't need ultra security just because you are using Bitcoin. It all depends on how much money you're dealing with. If you only have a small amount of money in your account you don't need cold storage and it would be a waste of time.

Start a meetup and pay the fee's for a few months while you build members, then once you have a good number just end your meetup group and transition to a facebook group, which is free (and almost everyone has). Also use the trick utuxia mentions. I did the same thing, (backed out while setting it up after seeing the cost) and a few days later they sent me an offer for half price.

There's more to cryptocurrency than transaction speed, fee's and anonymity. But ignoring that, this thread just screams bullshit. Define "instant transactions". Define "100% anonymous". It could be argued no such thing exists, even credit cards take some time to transact. Even if it was made by aliens you couldn't guarantee its 100% anonymous. Even Tor doesn't claim to be 100% anonymous. 
I haven't read up on maidsafe recently, but I'm assuming its still unreleased. All these claims are only as far as the developer knows. Not only do we have to trust the developer that these claims are true, we can't begin to have a good idea how secure something is until it's been out for a while. So say this coin comes out today, so what? Bitcoin has been out for years and stood the test of time. All these claims by the developer are untested in the real world.
Last time I looked at maidsafe there were a lot of amazing claims and very little detailed documentation on how those features worked. 
I suggest everyone be skeptical of any new cryptocoins that lack information and make big "too good to be true" claims.

I'm not sure what you mean by "Bitcoin with some upgrades". That could mean literally Bitcoin with some upgrades, as in add new features to Bitcoin, or it could mean a new coin based off Bitcoin but does not use the Bitcoin block chain. 
What I mean when I say a more modern cryptocurrency is this: it won't be Bitcoin. There's only so much you can do with the existing infrastructure. I haven't heard of any new innovative features planned for bitcoin that compare to the new cryptocurrencies showing up like Etherium and NXT. No matter how much the bitcoin code is updated, it's still based on old outdated concepts, many of which can't or won't be changed because it's not practical.

Sigh. 


Not really sure where you are going with this... Hitler has a mustache, my neighbor has a mustache... my neighbor is a mass murderer? You compare one aspect of circle and one aspect of a fiat bank, and? Maybe you can elaborate on the conclusion you are getting from this and why. 


I think you misunderstand how most Bitcoin supporters think.
So there are different levels of trust that exist. Bitcoin isn't completely trust-less, and It's never been a completely trust-less system. Current Bitcoin supporters don't completely distrust central authorities. I imagine most Bitcoin users distrust central authorities different amounts, and completely distrusting central authorities seems impossible or unrealistic in practice. So it's no surprise that Bitcoin users trust a website like circle to some degree, in limited amounts. 
I trust Circle for as long as it takes me to buy the Bitcoin and transfer it to a Bitcoin wallet. Any risk associated with that I am willing to bear, and the risk seems pretty low for the amount of time that takes compared to some other methods like buying Bitcoins locally. The centralized nature of USD makes it hard to buy Bitcoin without going through some centralization, what kind of magic is the Bitcoin community supposed to do to get around that huh? Lets be realistic. The only real solution is mass adoption. 
It could be argued that in order for Bitcoin to achieve the level of decentralization that it would like... you need mass adoption. You need stores and people accepting btc directly, but that kind of stuff only comes with mass adoption. You will always have some people sacrificing security for convenience, and it's realistic to expect that. There are always new services coming out that improve the Bitcoin experience, some help decentralize Bitcoin, others might centralize it, ultimately it's up to the user how to acquire and use their own Bitcoin, which is exactly what the creator intended.

So if you're sending btc somewhere, you copy most of the addy, paste it and then add on the last digits. In this situation the attacker wouldn't have gotten his btc but they wouldn't have gone where it was supposed to either. Seems to make more sense to just verify the first and last couple of digits each time you send something.

Ah then surely you must understand why the same exact thing applies to your suggestion.


but what the hell, I will point out uses that bitcoin excels at, right here. Many of these bitcoin excels at exclusively.
anonymous - Can be used for gambling (already is). Can also be used to accept donations  by sites like 4chan who have had trouble getting advertisers in the past, since they are rejected by paypal etc because of their content. 
unregulated - currently unregulated, hard to tax, 
Donations- Probably the biggest use of bitcoins so far, is people using them to donate. Furthermore, bitcoins don't have to be stable for them to be used for this. Its incredibly easy to start accepting bitcoin donations. Theres a bunch of people with bitcoins out there supporting bitcoin accepted sites, and any website catering to the computer enthusiast crowd would be a fool not to accept them.
Just considering the illegitimate uses, bitcoin has enough of a niche market to stay afloat. Hell if 10% of the black market in the US used bitcoins it would be huge. As long as its being used for something it does not matter if its legitimate or illegitimate.
If bitcoin is adopted by online retailers (over time, of course nothing happens overnight like some people seem to expect). Then it will only make it more appealing to illegitimate uses.
The other big reason I see people using bitcoins is their low overhead. Yet another reason why they're being used for donations.

I think you have it backwards. The price is not supposed to go to 100 dollars and then they get adopted. What should happen is, as they slowly get more adopted the price rises.

I guess you've never bought and sold stocks before. Well just a FYI, any type of regulation will drive up operating costs. So even if you consider that theres good and bad regulation,  “good” regulation still drives up costs. This is because it requires manpower to enforce them. 
As for me, the regulation that bothered me the most when buying and selling stocks was the one requiring a stock to "settle" 3 days after being sold. Then you add taxes and having to keep track of all that shit, and the costs of typical regulations being passed on to the consumer it all adds up and gets pretty annoying. 
Furthermore, at one time I had an interest in daytrading, and I would have liked to try it with 500 bucks or so, but in order to daytrade you have to have an account with at least 20k, and have margin. So someone like me who just wanted to get some experience with it, couldn't. I hope thats enough regulation for you, I'm not going to go look up the specific names of these regulations, but feel free to show me if I'm wrong.

"Not only do we have to trust the developer that these claims are true, we can't begin to have a good idea how secure something is until it's been out for a while."
So tell me how long has it actually been out? I doubt since 2006. It doesn't matter how long ago someone thought something up, the reason I mentioned bitcoin was because it has stood the test of time. It's one thing to claim something is secure and its another for something to have been secure for many years.

*Ah then surely you must understand why the same exact thing applies to your suggestion.* words in italic apply to quote above.
Theres plenty of free market alternatives to make transactions safe without government regulations. People can encrypt their wallet and use escrow type services if that really concerns them.

Look at the average volume of bitcoin on the biggest exchange. Now calculate how much downward pressure will be lost each day because of the halving. Not that much. Last time bitcoin did go up but it wasn't immediately after, and no one know if it was because of the halving or not. For all we know it could have been gox using bots to raise the price, or some other reason.
