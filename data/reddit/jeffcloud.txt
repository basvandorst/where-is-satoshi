Very nice! One more question, on which site I can find BTC historical price on a certain date? CoinMarketCap?

By that time, will quantum computer find master private key through xpub? Since xpub is shared.

How is change address generated in hardened derivation?

Number of coins x days of theses coins stay unmoved (utxo created till utxo spend)
Similar to Ton-Mile concept. Quantity of cargo transported x miles cargoes move.

OTC platform?

Then just make deflation happen. What’s the big deal? We have way too much zombie enterprise and bank that doesn’t make economic sense existing all over the world. A clear out should happen but not happen due to no deflation.

Very nice sub. I’ve gone through all comments and they are just amazing.

Then why is Gold more valuable than Silver, more so than Iron. They are all metals. Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency, and most well known, thus most valuable.

Fully copy the bitcoin code makes it a full node. A slight change of it make it a fork coin. No fork coin except Bitcoin Cash carries significant value, even Bitcoin Cash is trading 1/7 of Bitcoin and still it’s way overvalued.

You can still choose to send btc on chain instead of using LN.

Cash out by OTC again then.
