Played it without sound and it was perfect. Realized there was sound and it ruined the experience for me.

I buy dips. Very small amount but I feel better about myself when I do it. Usually just a $100 here and there.

So when we buy coin through say coinbase and we don’t withdraw, coinbase is still in control of the coin in their wallet? So essentially they could own thousands of bitcoin because they are an exchange, and sell off/buy back in whenever they want to?

I wonder if you could help me pay for college and claim it as a deduction on your taxes? 
25. Working at Bosch. 2 children. A dream of mine to have a degree. 
Aside from that would love to see if you could help kids who are growing up in poverty. I grew up without food/water and lights very often when I was a kid. If I ever make it, I would definitely try to start something in my local community to help those kids.
Someone find a good charity for that!

I have a traditional 401k with 9% match that I get from my employer. I max it out every year. Just had some extra funds that I wanted to “diversify” on crypto only. Good advice though for sure!

Loll. New here but HODL ��

So just send it to my wallet? 
Can the exchanges scam you?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:24:59
Should I just flip it all to bit?
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:43:08
I’ve had coinbase for months now to be honest. I recently lost my job and cashed what little crypto I had out. I honestly would like to send it back to them. I know how easy it is to make a mistake and bitcoin needs all the positivity it can get.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:17:29
Hmmm. Good to know then. Is it possible its just taken months to recieve it? If it was $10 and now its $13 thats 30% increae so thats alot...
