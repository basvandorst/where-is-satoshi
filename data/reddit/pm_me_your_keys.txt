This is the way to do it - "pay-what-you-want" or more accurately "pay-what-you-want-if-you-want-a-sequel".
If I was an author, I'd eventually put multiple addresses in, allowing my readers to vote on topics / direction for the next piece based on which address they pay to.

Slight problem - financial laws have serious jail time

I second this - many issues with multibit. Use electrum if you want a local thin client, or use paper like I do for long term storage

Because there's no shockers in the document - it's all what was expected, and generally what's reasonable. If I was a major player I'd want this document to not have any shockers before I launched. Sure it will be tweaked, but not in any major way.

Sweeping is optional - but some apps now require it.
Your bitcoins are only as secure as the private key that's used to spend them. If you generate a private key offline, then bring it into a phone, it's now "hot" and without a clear visibility history. The app doesn't know how exposed that key has been. Also if the app uses deterministic addresses (all stemming from one key), it's not a part of that tree.
So some apps will ask you to sweep the key - transferring all the bitcoins controlled by that key you just scanned to a key it prefers.

Interesting - except Charlie Schrem tried that... The issue is money laws are way more serious than telco laws. The stakes are way higher for non-compliance.
This really only applies to businesses that are crypto only, and I fully agree with the article for that.

Great - PM sent

anyone down to bet one a price target for the next 30 minutes? until 4am EST?
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:39:55
TIL Circle, Trucoin, Second Market now have the confidence they need to bring Bitcoin to Wall Street.

Anyone know pricing? Likely not cheap but interested.

If you want a BitLicense, you need to submit your fingerprints as part of the application...
$3000 and over requires ID'ing customers.
Game currency and businesses accepting virtual currency as payment are excluded.

Should start with a 5

Why trust vos so blindly? They have all the same risks as any other - and it seems bad things are happening there too.
Effort and results are two different things.

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value - Bitcoin's value comes from its ability to transfer money instantly, anywhere, at no cost and without permission.
How are Bitcoins made? - Every ten minutes the thousands of computers that store the account list (ledger) sync up. When that sync happens one computer is chosen at random to lead it. That computer is awarded 25 New issue Bitcoins. This stops transaction fraud because nobody knows who is going to be picked, and if you scam you're banned.
What can you buy with Bitcoin? - now it's more what can't you buy. If you can't pay directly there is a third party who will sell anything for Bitcoin. Flights, Hotels, tiger direct, overstock.com, any registered bill payment (including taxes). Even Walmart gift cards can be bought with Bitcoin. Oh and dollars too if you need them :)
Why use Bitcoin? - today it might not yet make sense for the average joe - it's a growing technology. But if you send money around the world, you should be using it. Some stores offer steep discounts to use it (6% off Walmart purchases using egifter), tiger direct was offering something like 20% off since they don't have any fraud with Bitcoin (it's irreversible). The answer isn't answered fully yet, but that's why it's still a very interesting space, it's growing rapidly.

Sweet - except nothing but bad things to say about this chain - at least they're trying!
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:19:11
Are you certain they use the EFT network? I think/thought they developed their own network as they're instantly cleared and reversible.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:40:47
I hate the word Virtual Currency - it's Digital Property!
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:04:41
I second this question
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:12:10
Concur - but I like to diversify my risk. A few coins here a few coins there. The real mistake is keeping them all in one place, even if you control the private keys.

Time to PM me your keys
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:12:22
oh! I didn't even notice it wasn't interac - they should call them tangerine transfers or something - no knowledge to answer you question sorry
speculation: they are reversible even if they claim they are not, just like interac emt's are, even when interac claims they are not

I didn't think I was going to watch the whole thing but then I did

Tell me about it! I'm in EST and likely not going to sleep if this keeps up
