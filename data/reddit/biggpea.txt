It is not a meaningful comparison. That is my only point. Are you suggesting a 21% bull run is comparable to a 160% bull run? The phenomena driving each bull run are totally different, and the magnitude of the increase is totally different as well. The chart is not "wrong" per se, just unhelpful.

It's not just the stability aspect holding bitcoin back. I can't "be my own bank" unless the currency I hold is widely accepted. Unfortunately, the place we have gotten to is where people in this sub openly celebrate merchants dropping bitcoin because, "you shouldn't buy a sandwich on the blockchain." Okay, of course we won't get adoption with that attitude. Without wider adoption, bitcoin can't be a true currency because it's not a liquid asset. You have to cash it out to buy anything, so it is as slow as cashing out a stock or mutual fund. 
If I want to go buy a TV right now, my bitcoin is about as useful as shares of Home Depot stock. Both have value, but neither are currency. Bitcoin is basically digital gold, which is pretty cool but it is not the "digital cash" people originally thought it might become. We are not there, and actually we are not even heading there right now.
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:37:43

So it's breaking news that bitcoin and equities both happen to be increasing? My point is not that the chart is nonfactual, just that it is deceptive. First, the chart shows nothing of significance. Second, the "side effect" of the chart is that casual observers come away believing that bitcoin is performing similarly to equities.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:43:01
The block size is part of the bitcoin protocol (rules of the game, so to speak). Market forces can't change the rules. Any change has to be agreed upon by a wide range of people before being enacted.

It's not scaling at all. It's totally capped. We've had 10 months of zero growth (in transactions). Not 0.01% growth, not 0.00001%--zero.
This is not an argument, it's just a statement.

I hope blocks eventually increase in size, but it won't be with BU. BU is not serious--it's a political stunt. BU may have had good intentions, but the tactics were not thought out. For a change in the protocol, we need to get *consensus*. Instead, BU formed a contentious faction which undermines consensus and ensures the status quo. If you want small blocks forever, do exactly what BU is doing.
Many people who support Core also want bigger blocks. Adam Back is on the record supporting a 2-4-8 plan. Many if not most Core devs want (wanted?) bigger blocks. At some point, for some reason, everyone suddenly seemed to jump to extreme positions and we find ourselves caught in gridlock for the time being. Now it is has basically become a dick measuring contest. Nothing will change until both sides swallow their ego and compromise. We'll see if that ever happens.
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:35:46
Yeah, you are right. The articles even states "A look at bitcoin's performance relative to the S&amp;P 500's over the last five years does not show any particularly close mathematical relationship between the two." So really the chart pointless. It's not wrong, just misleading.
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:32:43
For me the bottom line is that the chart doesn't convincingly show anything of consequence. The frustrating part is that the "side effect" of the chart is that the casual observer comes away thinking that bitcoin and equities are performing similarly which is not the case. Just because the values are accurate doesn't mean it's not deceptive.

If you like Xapo, awesome. I'm not trying to shit on Xapo or bitpay or anyone.
That being said, this is not "be your own bank." The difference between Xapo  and conventional financial services like Paypal, Wells Fargo, or Amex is minimal. You have to sign up (permission), hope they have a secure system (trust), and pay them fees (overhead). Bitcoin is supposed to bypass all of this.
Xapo may be a great company (I've haven't tried it), and it might be a useful service to take advantage of, but it's not bitcoin strictly speaking.
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:40:32
Good point, maybe that wouldn't play too well over TV. But that is really how one would have to go about making an argument about correlation. I actually don't think they have an agenda, I just think the chart is a little misleading (probably by accident). That's all.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:15:02
Maybe the chart is relevant, but it is an objectively poor representation of the data. If you actually want to show correlation or lack there of, you should plot 30-day or 90-day rolling correlation coefficient over time (say 2014 to present or Feb 2016 to present). Their chart is accurate, but poorly thought out and somewhat misleading. A quick glance seems to indicate similar growth between equites and bitcoin. You have to pull out your calculator and do some math to realize that bitcoin is outpacing equities significantly.
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:15:08
Yes, I totally agree that there is not a linear relationship between scaling and value. Transaction volume may remain fixed, but the value could still go up to $1500 or even $5000 (or higher).
However, I would guess that the price will, at some point, hit a ceiling if bitcoin doesn't *eventually* scale. I could be wrong.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the current price reflects future expectations also. Without any future scaling the ceiling may be $10,000 or it could be $200. The current price may have overshot the long term value, because people are expecting that scaling will, in fact, happen.
I'm still buying coin, since I believe we *will* scale. Segwit would be scaling, lightening would be scaling, 2MB would be scaling so there are many ways we can scale. Unfortunately despite a basket of great scaling options we have chosen "none of the above", but I think this is just a temporary setback.

I could quote half a dozen or so core devs saying, on the record, they want bigger blocks. Probably more than half a dozen if you took a poll.
The problem is there is no magic wand to make bigger blocks and a hard fork is doable, but tricky. It seems like a few things spooked the devs and is making them more cautious,
1) people not getting on board with segwit (should be a no brainier)
2) observing the ETH fork
3) people running non-Core nodes
Probably a few other things that I haven't though of too.
I'm not up the ass of small blockers either. I'll call out bullshit such as "even a 0.1MB block increase is detrimental to decentralization" or "miners currently need high fees" (90%+ of their revenue comes from the coinbase now)--yes, I have heard both those comments. 
Ultimately the status quo wins if people don't compromise which really means the ball is in BU-supporters court. I personally would like to see segwit and the 2MB HF, but I'm not the dictator of bitcoin, so I'll just patiently wait.

Why do people say Core is bad at communication? It's simple--segwit has not been activated. 
Let's consider the possibilities why.
1. Core has not communicated why segwit is good for bitcoin to enough people in a *compelling enough way*.
2. Segwit is not good for bitcoin.
I personally believe segwit is great, so I think Core's communication (aka marketing) has been lacking.
Look at it this way. If you have a product that is not selling, either your product is great but no one knows about it (poor marketing) or your product sucks.
Also, to say the miners have bad communication is missing the point. Core wrote segwit. They have to communicate why it's good. Don't blame the customer for bad marketing.

Denominate the block reward in dollars not btc and you will find that rewards are *growing* not shrinking. Would you rather have a 50 btc reward when bitcoin was at $2.00/coin, or 12.5 btc today?
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:02:21
This is exactly correct. I will also add that they have written some brilliant code (segwit) which is currently collecting dust in a closet because they haven't been able to convince enough people that it is good.
"convince people" is one in the same as "communication"
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:41:44
Won't work. Even with 0 transaction fees, miners will make ~90% of their current profits from the block reward. For example, mining a typical block brings in a 12.5 btc coin base reward, but only 1.7 btc in fees. They would go from making ~14.2 btc to 12.5 btc. It's a drop, but not enough to stop mining.
Also, ASICs are much more energy efficient. They are great for bitcoin because you get more total security in the network for less total electricity used. Ditching ASICs for CPU/GPU is like ditching cars for horses.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:14:06
So if the mining reward goes to zero in over 100 years, we need high transaction fees now? This makes no sense. Timing people, timing.

OP is not totally wrong, but I'm just trying to give a reality check. Hashrate varies +- a few percentage points, while transaction volume varies by orders of magnitude.
There is a misconception that since miners processes transactions, more miners will move things along faster. My only point is that the issue is not too few miners, it's too many transactions.
The protocol is designed for a block to be pushed out every 10 minutes and with a few exceptions it does pretty damn well at that.

January -&gt; blocks 501961 to 507016...average time 9 min 50 seconds

If bitcoin were the US, we'd be in the 1850s, and the lightening network would be the transcontinental railroad. Don't sell yet!
The problem with the bitcoin market is that a lot of the future value is already priced into the market, so there is not quite as much upside in the value as there is in utility. It's like Tesla--the current stock valuation is insane based on the fundamentals, but there is a lot of upside so people have bid up the price. If you are willing to take a risk and tie up your money for a while it may pay off big. That being said, Tesla is so overpriced at the moment, you would not look there for short term gains.

People have been continuously pulling out profits the entire time. Haven't you read all the stores of people who had 5000 coins and cashed out at $50? There is a lot of turnover.
The thing about your argument is that you will never be proven wrong because you can always claim that the bubble hasn't popped yet. Whereas, I just continue to stack profits on profits.


But it wasn't pricked the 6 other times we had similar dips? I personally was stunned that bitcoin survived the Mt Gox bust. After that, I was like this fucker isn't going anywhere.

Oh yeah, big time. I would not put money in that I need in the next 5-10 years. Same with stock or real estate. You don't want to have to liquidate in a bear market.


The tech in BTC is way ahead of all the other cryptos (eth is close, but it is a totally different use case than bitcoin). 95% of other projects copy and past bitcoin's code.


Can't go through all that here. I'd recommend the Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos.
It's okay to disagree with the fundamental idea of bitcoin, but I still can't figure out why you ever bought any if you don't think it is a good technology. I recommend embracing at least the concept before staking your money.

That's any form of money dude. usd is worthless unless it is tied to food, gas, rent, etc.


This is a meaningless statement. The whole point of an open market is price discovery between two assets--in this case usd and btc. The market is literally saying $8600 is equivalent to 1 btc.

Excellent news. Thanks for the update.

Bitcoin is two things (maybe more), a store of value and a means of transaction. People differ on this, but my personal opinion is that it must be a means of transaction in order to be a store of value. Let's set that aside for now.
The value of bitcoin as a means of transaction can be evaluated by looking at the transaction fees paid. That is bitcoin's current "income" in a way. You can compare that to other payment processors like PayPal, Visa, Western Union, etc. Daily fees are $5-10 million per day currently. For comparison, PayPal pulls in maybe around $30 million a day. PayPal has a market cap of $90 billion, Visa has a market cap of $280 billion, Western Union has a market cap of around $9 billion, Mastercard has a market cap of around $180 billion. Bitcoin could shave market cap off any of these current players.
The value of bitcoin as a store of wealth is more tricky. Bitcoin has been called by some digital gold. There is currently, around $8 trillion worth of gold in the world. Many people diversify their portfolio with 1-5% in gold. If some of this shifted over to bitcoin, that could be a large amount of money. People also purchase real estate as a store of value. The global real estate market is around $220 trillion. The global bond market is around $80 trillion. Whatever people decide to buy drive up the price of that thing. If people want oil, oil goes up. If people want real estate, real estate goes up. If people want bonds, bonds go up. If people want bitcoin, bitcoin goes up. It's that simple.
Bitcoin will not totally replace any of the above, however it can shave off market share. It has already been shown that younger people are diverting money which would traditionally been placed in stocks into crypto assets.
These numbers are not complete. Please do your own math as well.

Dude, it wouldn't change anything. Hashtrate isn't the problem.

I'm not triggered. I'm just stating facts. Blackjack is a black hole where you can loose infinite money. With bitcoin, you pretty much just have to hodl and you are good. There is not comparison at all.


Enough ink has been spilled on the potential use cases of bitcoin. If you don't think bitcoin/crypto has underlying utility, I don't know why you would even bother with it.
Many of us early adopters are in it because of the amazing technology--I was sold after reading Satoshi's whitepaper. In the short term, I don't care where the price goes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:42:04
Except blackjack is a zero sum game, while bitcoin is not. *If* bitcoin becomes a widely used international currency, the price will indefinitely grow at the rate at which the bitcoin economy grows. For example, if bitcoin takes over a stable 0.5% of the US economy, and the economy grows at 2-3%, you will get nice gains in perpetuity.

Makes no sense...there is not a connection between hash rate and fees. You could have 1 PC miner but tons of nodes making many transactions which would still bid up fees. Conversely, you could have 100 times the global hash rate we currently have and nobody making transactions, and fees would be at zero. No connection there.
Fees roughly follow transaction volume. Hash rate roughly follows electricity price relative to total block reward in fiat (which is how people pay for electricity).

Agreed, Bread is great. I'll admit it sucks that SegWit has taken so long, but besides that the functionality, security, and interface are all best in class.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:38:07
Sure, no problem. I literally have zero idea what it will do in the next 1-2 years, but I'm optimistic about the next 5-10.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:46:07
This is the dumbest statement ever. Segwit is maybe the 8th most clever piece of code inside of bitcoin (generously). There is a lot of a crazy advanced technology in bitcoin. What evidence do you have that it's so much more significant than everything else?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:52:03
Good points--I agree. I'm mostly addressing the use of "fintech", since it's not the tech that is significant here. Segwit, basically a small bug fix+efficiency boost, is sucking all the oxygen out of the room. Can we talk about sidechains? How about confidential transaction?
Also, overstated hyperbole is annoying.

I empathize for people getting screwed by these weak economies. But I can’t for the life of me understand why they keep electing these incompetent ass hats. Like, this isn’t Soviet Russia—these people are getting voted in. Chile isn’t having these issues...
