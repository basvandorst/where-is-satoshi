Satoshi hasn't said anything about who goes and who doesn't, In fact he said it's for everyone.

That's why Bitcoin is beautiful, you don't get to say who goes and who doesn't.

No conspiracy, just a lot of huge coincidences.

It's been time to buy for a while now. Since the first time it went down to 5k.
But the sharks just want you to create FUD so they can scoop every BTC in weak hands. Why do you think we see fear posts on a Bitcoin enthusiastic forum.
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:32:51
Except he talked 7 months, not one year. 7=/=12
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:50:26
It's pretty obvious. Whenever there's shorts, there's people in social media bashing an asset, including reddit.
Shorting is cancer. They have financial incentive to bash whatever they are shorting.
Take TSLA for example, the shorters are taking a pounding, but they still come on twitter saying "Tesla is bad.....mmkay?"
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:35:51
They even use memes now. Desperate

I agree with your assessment. Also in 2017, previous ATH was 1300, then it went all the way up to 20k in December. That's more than 10x.

Really? Where are these trees you are talking about?
Thanks for the laughs.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:28:59
No, panic from "China bans Bitcoin", "Gox collapse" and other stupid nonsense caused the 2013 crash because human psychology in the market.
Also, any time drama stories like the willy bot come out, some whale sells their coins and hundreds of users go after. Then the whale picks up the pieces from panic hands.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:10:28
Yeah, wait till your bank sees Coinbase in your statement. I'm sure they are going to cheer for that.

I still don't get how you guys go to an enthusiastic sub about whatever, say opposing thoughts and expect validation.
It's like the buttcoiners who come here. I mean, did you expect to change someone's mind in a few minutes?
Not only that, but then you get all offended and have the need to invalidate them:

@_date: 2018-03-06 14:13:33


No, people are being arrested because they are not paying tax on selling Bitcoin for cash.

@_date: 2018-03-08 13:32:32
The bullshit drama you guys come up from some whales selling their coins is quite hilarious.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:29:53
2nd video is hilarious. These people spit statements without even analyzing what they say. First he states that people use $100 bills for storing wealth from criminal activities. Then he says they should play wack-a-mole with Bitcoin for the same reason, but then it says people use it in low scale.
It's just a mix of stupid statements without any analysis.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:34:05
I understand your argument, but it's not as important as you think. 90% of those 1500+ coins are not even traded anymore.
Just because information is there, doesn't mean it's relevant.

How is no one asking this?
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:14:01
Don't worry, there's no base for those worries.
A centralized blockchain is not much more than an encrypted database with one central point of failure and with a 3rd party intermediary that controls it. What's the point of that?
The point of a decentralized blockchain is that you don't need a central entity to stamp your transfer, so it's trustless. That's the climax of the technology which banks don't want to understand. It's like a big woooosh for them.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:52:01
And this is how you give your money to the wealthy. The banks say thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:06:27
That's fine, I can wait another 3 years for 150 percent.
After all, it's better than any other global 24/7 asset, transferable and accessible anywhere, that I can store safely without a 3rd party charging me fees.
How about this, all 100% past sell-offs were surpassed.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:28:26


Exactly! There's no other financial asset with these properties, so stop trying to label it as another financial asset. Bitcoin is not a commodity because its properties are of financial value and provide financial utility. No commodity does this.
Maybe calling it super-commodity.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:55:22

Wow, Warren Buffett sure has his fits about Bitcoin latelly. Good, that was the whole point of Bitcoin. To dethrone the old farts that have accumulated an insane amount of wealth.
Is he upset that his billions of Mastercard and Visa Shares might take a hit?
Or is he upset that his old brain can't quite figure out how it works and how to get profit out of it?
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:17:10
Yeah, the days of "my exchange got hacked" and pocketing the hack money is over. This is why we need regulation over the exchanges, not the cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:15:13
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:44:42
Do banks allow this?
Any major loan (house, student, car) in Europe are supervised where they are spent. Meaning the bank will make sure you apply the money in what you asked the loan for.
I can't see the US not having similar regulation.
I'm thinking this is major article bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:04:19

First of all, I just said bye bye to him. A religion tries to pull people in, not push people out.
Second, Bitcoin is based in science and math, not in "faith".

Funny how everyone who fully understands Bitcoin says "This is world-transforming technology"

He also knows that for it to reach 20 trillion doesn't take much.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:40:30
The hoops you have to go through to buy a stock are immense. And you don't actually hold it. Someone holds it for you.
You can easily buy and hold Bitcoin with an app, 24/7.
Unfortunately it also makes it way easier to buy and sell, thus the volatility.
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:03:40
So were all the China bans, yet I didn't see people jumping this quick to deny it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:25:18
The way people clapped on the word Bitcoin seemed like some people had the idea on what it is and that is seen on good light.
What I'm a bit confused is why did Ellen dedicated a whole sketch about it, without really explaining anything and in some part to make fun of it. I know they sell time because I've seen multiple products being advertised, but in here seemed like someone bought time to make fun of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:39:12
All this noise we have been hearing are shorters and idiots that want to buy in lower, so we may not even wait that long to see it fly above 10k again.

Stop misinforming people. POS doesn't take away the user's choice. You can fork a POS anytime you want and ask users to come with you.
You need to read up on POS, if anything it removes mining centralization.
EDIT: I see, now people just spread misinformation and lies to favor the coin they are invested in.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:58:02
Oh, so because it's not the same kind of hack, then it's totally fine to intervene. Got it.

At this point Bill Gates has lost so many tech waves (Search engine, mp3, tablets, mobile phones, mobile software, etc.) that I am not surprised he would miss yet another one. Also, let's not forget that Microsoft is invested in Ethereum, so criminals don't use Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:35:22
Yeah, Bitcoin is so insignificant, except it allows for globally, unforgeable, decentralized, cheap, fast transactions.
I mean, it's not like the finance world would need such an asset.
It's a worthless bubble, but you need to hang around these parts to spread that bullshit. What are you afraid of? Go back to The_Donald sub.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:28:54
Since banks are paying to bad mouth Bitcoin, nothing surprises me anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:11:26
Let me guess. You must be the ones that got into Bitcoin when it proved it's worth it...
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:23:34
My point is that you can't ban technology, EU and US are not like China.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:06:52
I don't think you understood what I meant.
What I meant was that people are trying to separate Blockchain from the cryptocurrency. Not talking about Bitcoin in particular or any other currency.
Just banksters trying to say, yes Blockchain is amazing, but cryptocurrencies not so much. They say this because they don't have a clue of how it works.

Not in democratic countries. There's no reasonable argument for making such a law.

Let alone trying to stop an internet protocol. It would be ridiculous.

Robin Hood is recent and hopefully will change the way to hold stock. But truth is that Robin Hood is not available world wide.
Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:58:52


Now you are just making assumptions of the future. This was not the argument. Go back to your traditional finance that you seem to understand so well. Bye bye.
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:24:53
Banks CEOs only understand budgets, profits and have no clue about tech and how to innovate their business.
So something like Bitcoin comes along and they spit words from their mouth which obviously point out how clueless they are.
Because they don't understand it, they immediately assume it's a threat, so they fight it as they can (calling it a fraud). 
Then after everyone is like "Wtf is this idiot talking about?", they backtrack and play the victim role.
A smart CEO will incorporate Bitcoin into their ecosystem and empower their clients to use it.
A smart CEO would have bought someone like Coinbase and incorporate into their own website, making fees in the process and easying the process of holding/using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:28:27
Ah ok, so you agree that Warren Buffett is very wrong with his Bitcoin failure predictions.
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:33:52
At this point I just blame the publications for even running a story where there is none.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:46:49

@_date: 2018-02-11 14:17:53


The point you are missing? He didn't have the power.
He provided the option, either people chose new ETH fork or continue on old ETH fork (called classic). Most people chose new ETH. 
It's better than democracy because minorities still use the old Ethereum and both are running even today. 
People who compare this with censorship are obtuse. Bitcoin has had forks in the past to save from Bugs, so come down that step of superiority.
He doesn't have power to reverse a transaction, so don't compare it with Paypal or Visa which can ban you if they feel inclined to.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:27:24
Ok granpa. Go back to the bank then.

OP is a liar.
This is the sort of statement I can also do if I were to exaggerate as OP.
There is a huge difference from slow support to money being stolen.
The issue that has been stated in this sub over and over again is that Kraken are very slow to respond to support due to high traffic.
I still don't get why people keep using them. Just use Bitstamp, magnitudes better than kraken.

@_date: 2018-02-11 14:22:15
Are people forgetting that Bitcoin was also forked to fix a bug? People really need to come down from that step of superiority.
Also, both ETH and ETC chains are running and people can chose which one they want. This is even better than democracy, so stop calling it censorship.
With the fork, Vitalik just gave users the option to chose which chain they wanted.

But they don't know how low they can keep selling, or if it will work.
There are also whales buying and collecting btc from shaky hands.

@_date: 2019-01-11 11:15:32
You don't have to, but you can use their platform.
Bitcoin is a protocol.
You don't browse the internet using TCP/IP, you use a browser.
You don't use Bitcoin protocol directly, you use wallets and platforms. Some wallets allow you to manage and store bitcoin locally or send it. Other platforms allow you to manage and store Bitcoin online so you can pay subscriptions or exchange it for other products and services.
It's all about making it user friendly, which is what is in progress to make Bitcoin used by everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:52:06


No, Bitcoin crashes as transactions spamming the chain
Then it crahes with the Whole Coinbase fiasco and insider trading
Then it crashes when Fake China bans pop all over the place
Then it crashes when fake Korea bans pop all over the place.
Then it crahes some more whatever other country fake bans Bitcoin
Then it crashes a bit more when credit card companies block purchases
I just wonder why these pseudo-publications don't pick up on this trend.

Exactly. This is good for people who are waiting to be verified on an exchange.
Buy Bitcoin in Robinhood till you are verified in an exchange. When you are verified, sell on Robinhood and buy it on the exchange.

Wait a minute! Stop spreading misinformation.
A grant and a loan are two completely different things.
A grant is like a scholarship but from the government. It's usually given to people from low income families or other particular situations. A loan is from a financial institution and needs to paid back.
In UK and Europe there's always been both things and are used for different purposes.

@_date: 2018-02-13 13:29:41
This is what happens when financial people try to fit Bitcoin in something they understand.
Before they do that, they should try to study it and understand it. 
Then they can come up with a new term for it, because finance has never seen an asset like this before.
What I learned and surprised me with this whole ordeal of Bitcoin is how most of Financial "experts" don't really contribute much to evolution of finance. Instead their incentive is to make money and speculate on assets.

I won't give them props and here's why:
- They were making users pay (in fees) for their incompetence and delays in keeping up with technology.
- The whole Bitcoin Cash fiasco and insider trading
- They still don't have Batching, making users pay for bigger fees than what Bitcoin allows.
- They haven't come out and apologized for all of the above.
They were the top US exchange, so they should be at the forefront of the technology. Instead they are last.

This just smells like the willy bot report. A good story without any proof what-so-ever about how it proped up the price of Bitcoin. Except there's plenty of proof that Bitcoin had a surge of use, search and adoption in late 2013.

From someone who has seen life without internet, internet adoption and internet mainstream. Just no. Internet has revolutionized the way of life in so many ways and has brought so many positive aspects.
Only in the last 8 years, it has started to be used to heavily influence political and personal views. But it doesn't work in all countries and cultures.
Also, blaming the internet or Bitcoin for people's views is quite dumb. There was no internet in the beginning of 20th century and see how many countries went into dictatorships.
Bitcoin and especially crypto will revoutionize Finance as the internet revolutionized communication.
TL;DR People, countries and cultures can make dumb decisions on their own. Don't blame the internet or any technology.

Actually I meant Indefinitely.

Makes an expertise comment about something he has no idea how Bitcoin works.
Sometimes I wonder how these guys even get a Nobel Prize.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:37:40
Right, but how else would the [cesspit of a publication like Gizmodo](  paint a bad picture of Bitcoin users?

When it was Jamie Dimon calling it a Fraud it got a gazillion upvotes. Now that irony caught with him, doesn't even get 400 votes.
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:33:59


I don't think you grasp the idea of Bitcoin security.
TIL Crypto exchanges have mattresses
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:06:22


Not true. A lot of hodlers went through 2014-2017. I wouldn't call that get rich quick.
Also, the amount of people who lurk and comment around here, yet are not interested in holding Bitcoin is miles above any other subreddit. I wonder why. Traders have to push their agenda.

Except, only the whale that sold got fucked.

September chart? Why not December?
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:16:54


First of all, you don't know that. He has a team of traders working for him and you don't know how they trade.
Second, who says Max Keiser is not long term also?

OP only understands traditional finance and can't grasp the concept of a new asset that has the properties of an investment and the properties of currency.

He doesn't need luck. He was smart and bought them cheap.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:12:03
I don't think you understand how logic and math work
EDIT: Apparently there's no place for millennials who would not choose stocks or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:36:40
yeah, it's stupid....
I wonder how millionaires store their money.
Oh, that's right, they trust some people with it. GTFO, this is the real world.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:06:44


Yes as you did when you first bought.




My work is done here.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:45:55


After all these years, you still say this?
There is no value in having a non-forgeable valued signature that can be sent across the world without a third party involved?
This is why some people still don't understand bitcoin, yet they easily make comments like they are experts.
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:38:53
You have his Bitcoins under your bed? Multisig! I like how you think.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:37:26
Now you are confusing intrinsic value with market value. Those are two different things.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:11:12
Don't take it personal, but the market is shaking off people like you
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:12:18
How does this only have 22 upvotes?!?!
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:24:18
You are the one not understanding.
I said the intrinsic value comes from the trustless nature of passing valued signatures.
You then came with another non-related argument
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:48:19
What's next? number of daily farts vs price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:17:32
I've seen this in 2014 and see it again and again. It's just so easy to spot nowadays.
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:14:45
Yes and no. It matters what you can buy with it
