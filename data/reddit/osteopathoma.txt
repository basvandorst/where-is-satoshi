how do I set it to a lower price, but only have it occur when the market price goes that low? 
For example, if i put limit price of 3800 right now, it just sells it right now. How do I make it so that it only sells at 3800 when market hits that point? 
Also, how do I make it so that I buy at something like 4100 only when market hits that?

So it looks like Kraken has removed Stop Loss, etc Trading since August?

Is this the same for Kraken? Most likely you will get 1:1 for it?

Noon here. Is the reasoning for this just in case something happens to the exchange or it doesn't let you withdraw all of a sudden?

I bought bitcoin at 500-600 and then sold at 1k, biggest regret ever. Now I want to get back in the game, but the price is so high and I feel like it's not really worth it. What is the best way to do this?
I'm a student, so not much money we're talking about here, but I want to own a few atleast, but am worried about it crashing.
Should I wait and see if it will go lower? What do you guys think will happen by the end of the year and why?

So where do you see the price going now?

So is it a $1 fee on top of coinbase fee? Or is it just $1 a month and no coinbase fee?

I have mine on Kraken. Do you guys recommend the same? 
What do you do after when you want to trade again? Just send it back?
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:43:47
Same with Kraken?
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:01:50
Would it be smart to sell then buy more in a bit?

bump same question, why would you move it out of GDAX if it is supported?
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:40:49
Would you recommend GDAX over kraken? Is GDAX fairly easy to understand or learn?
I'm pretty frustrated that kraken doesn't have advanced orders available right now. Do you know if transferring from kraken to GDAX is free?
