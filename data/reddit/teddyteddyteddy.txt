Did it cost $240 a ticket?

Did you get a text deposit too?
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:44:58
Am I the only one who also received a text of a deposit?

Or the ones who already banked on BTC from the beginning. I hope this isn't a trend of a digital currency divide

Uh, good for you? 
It just further proves my point it visually associates itself with other currencies. It needs to stand on its own

When searching the web there seems to be a unified agreement narrowed down to "Ƀ or ฿" I personally think the 'Ƀ' is aesthetically best suited to represent bitcoin and its uniqueness. 
The *฿* conjures up thoughts of the American $ dollar. Bitcoin is an international, no borders currency and should visually show it.

Ha, didn't think of it like that, but I see your point.

Please make sure news of this get around. It'd be nice to see The Verge update their article. It's all about the theft in the bitcoin community.  
By Adrianne Jeffries 13 hours ago
Theft has been rampant in the Bitcoin community ever since the virtual currency was launched in 2009. That's why it's important to understand how it works before you try to use it.
Bloomberg TV host Matt Miller gave two anchors $20 worth of Bitcoin each using a paper certificate with a QR code made by the company Lazzerbee. Unfortunately, Miller flashed one of the private keys at the camera, unaware that he'd opened the account up to theft. It wasn't long before someone collected the Bitcoin.
MILLER FLASHED THE PRIVATE KEY AT THE CAMERA
A Reddit user named "milkywaymasta" claimed credit for the digital mugging, bragging that it was "exhilarating." He or she promised to transfer the funds back as soon as the owner created a new address for which the keys haven't been broadcast on daytime television.
"A segment on Bitcoin security and the importance of NOT showing the private key and also BIP0038 (Password Encrypted Private Keys) Wallets will be more than enough compensation," milkywaymasta wrote.

TIL: an 8th grader taught me how to mine bitcoins. 
Your intellect if far greater than your teachers. 
Trying to dumb down your material and level you with the average 8th grade student ( Which you clearly are not ) is not conducive to critical thinking nor nurturing creativity.

I bought from coinbase last Friday and it said I wouldn't receive my btc until this Friday. A full week. Even though the money cleared 2-3 days ago. I've been emailing them. After 30 days transactions become quicker.
