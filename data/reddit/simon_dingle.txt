My problem is more with technical analysis that looks for repeats in disparate patterns in pricing. They use big words and it all sounds very intelligent, until you realise they took a literal shape that a chart made and now expect it to make the same shape again because the first bit looks the same.
Of course, if your analysis is of the things that really shift sentiment, and therefore the market, then I'm all ears. But that would require having empirical evidence of something in the real world that is about to happen and factor in a lot more of the environment than some lines drawn on a chart. Which is just proximate.

I don't think we have enough information to make any conclusions on the hack yet. I'm pleased I chose Bitstamp for most of my volume and wasn't exposed on Bitfinex. That said, here's one way to think about it: if an exchange is hacked, and survives, you can be sure that security will become a priority for them. We think that exchanges that haven't been hacked are "safer" - but often it is the organisations that have been hacked, and survived, that come out stronger.

I'd ordinarily agree with you - and this is something I make a point of often. But in this case I was using an example (expensive airtime) that is true in all African countries I know of. Unless there is an exception I've missed?

Read the article. It basically comes down to: "because technical analysis". Apparently none of these people have read *The Black Swan*, *Fooled by Randomness* or *The Drunkard's Walk*. It never ceases to amaze me that otherwise smart people still fall for predictive models.

This is a great question and Bitcoin adoption still has a long way to go. It's not easy to understand why you should use something before everyone else is. However, there are many good reasons to buy and use Bitcoin today:
- Bitcoin is innovative and allows you to be your own bank. The old world of "fractional reserve" banking is exploitive and archaic. Central banks have failed us. Even if you don't believe or care about that, you should be interested in a more efficient system; a better technology - for the same reason you don't ride around in a horse cart (except for fun).
- The average redditor should be aware of what is currently happening in the global economy and that world leaders are currently printing money to prop up failing financial systems. Buying and using Bitcoin is a way to fight back against this system.
- The average redditor is probably old enough to remember the financial chaos of 2008 and 2009 and must be, at very least, wondering why that happened and how we can stop it from happening again. Bitcoin can be a big part of the solution if we let it. Even supporting it in a small way by buying a little Bitcoin, trying it out to pay for something, or enabling your customers to pay you with it, is helping.
- Bitcoin is a good store of value and a hedge against currency volatility. The price of dollars, pounds and other world currencies are increasingly volatile and current political tides suggest that this is just the beginning. Keeping some Bitcoin protects some of your money from that volatility - although you must also be aware that Bitcoin goes through periods of volatility for its own reasons. It should be part of your investment plan, but not all of it.
- If it matters to you, Bitcoin is cool :) By using Bitcoin you are part of a next-generation that is taking back financial control for themselves and doing great things. Some of the most interesting, thoughtful and well-meaning people I've met have been in the Bitcoin community.
- It's fun. At least, I think it is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Seriously though, paying with Bitcoin feels like taking a ride with Uber or Lyft, using Google Maps, or driving an electric car. It's just better.
^ A lot of that is peppered with my own personal opinions, but I hope it helps to answer your question ;)

This problem is rife and affecting many sites - not just Kraken. If I was into conspiracy theories, I'd suggest this was a coordinated attack against the cryptocurrency community. Something about it is just too slick and it must be costing a fortune to run. How can we fight back? A lot of unsuspecting people are going to burn their fingers and this is going to give the entire industry a bad name. Unfortunately the kind of people these attacks capture are not savvy enough to be using adblockers in the first place (if you're smart enough to use an adblocker, you're probably also smart enough to spot a phishing scam / look for certs, etc.)

I agree in 90% of the cases, but Genesis generally do a very good job. You make a good point about exploiting people's stupidity though. Hmmm..

Being from Africa, it's amazing to see how people in the rest of the world talk about smartphone penetration here as if it can be compared to more developed markets. For one, airtime is still expensive in Africa, so while everyone has a mobile phone, many people can not afford the bandwidth to download apps. If Bitcoin is going to make a difference here it will require some lateral thinking. For example, integrating with USSD systems (there is some of this taking place) or brokering deals to zero-rate data, etc. 
I believe that Bitcoin has a vital role to play in developing markets, but it requires a different level of thinking.

It depends on the country. I was in Zambia two weeks ago and it seems that people there are very reliant on cellular data, especially in more rural areas where there is no other forms of connectivity. In Kenya, however, public wifi is becoming increasingly common. In my country of South Africa things vary wildly from big cities with great connectivity (you can get 100Mbps FTTH in Cape Town and Johannesburg) and lots of free Wi-Fi, to less developed areas where it's cellular or nothing. There are interesting projects on the way though, thanks to Internet.org, Project Loon and others. Ubiquitous connectivity at cheap or free levels is coming, but it's not here yet. And one thing common in all countries is exploitatively high prices for mobile data.

That's an interesting idea. There have also been tests with "offline" wallets, although I'm not sure how these work ito reconciliation with the blockchain.

You're right on the assumption ;) - but I'm not sure we can compare Bitfinex to MtGox?

As others have pointed out, you can make your own steel storage for much less money - but I have purchased cryptosteel and do not regret it. Everything from the device to its packaging have been designed with care and it's fun to assemble. It's a nice-to-have, not a necessity. Don't regret purchasing mine.

The ad was shot in Cape Town, but isn't being flighted on TV anywhere. It went straight to YouTube.

Look for data on the drive that could tell you the owner is. Return it to them and I bet they'll reward you with some of that BTC, which is probably in an encrypted wallet file anyway.
Aside: This is a cool trick for old hard drives. Write '950 BTC' on them and toss them out.

I remember similar discussions at $250. The 40k number kept and keeps coming up.

We ship from Cape Town, South Africa. And yes, we ship to Europe.

Hmm... we definitely accept Bitcoin and deliver to Canada. Lemme know if I can help with orders ;)

Definitely the wrong place. We're at
