First comment. When moon.
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:49:56
Remember that bitcoin is pretty volatile. Just never invest what you can't afford to lose
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:23:41
Hi, when ultra moon to 20k.

hi when moon
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:30:06
honestly, i'm using gut feeling and absolutely nothing substantial here, but I feel like bitcoin is gonna retrace to 6k in a few months, hope not tho
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:12:40
hm I actually want bitcoin to rise a bit honestly, I'm looking forward to the price of alts going up
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:33:03
we're crashing again
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:33:06
don't forget that it has half naked supermodels riding on dinosaurs brandishing machine guns while the moon crashes into the earth. If you mentioned that part, i'm sure he would like it :)
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:50:52
Obligatory -&gt; when moon &lt;- post goes here
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:01:44
guess no more coinbase for me...sigh
@_date: 2018-05-16 19:38:49
Bitocnnect is down more than 40,000% since ATH. Don't ask why or about it's history, but quick! go buy now! you will be the richest man evar in the near future! 'cause hey hey heeeeeeeeeeyyyy!!

@_date: 2018-06-16 11:36:00
hmm i know that coinbase is good (aside from the fees) but not sure if the service the UK as well
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:41:12
dang going down again lol
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:01:17
if we turn the chart upside-down, we're mooning higher guys! :)
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:33:22
i think bitcoin was mostly only used in the dark web and other shady areas before it became mainstream...pretty sure outside of the pizza purchase, there weren't hardly any companies willing to touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole in the early years...
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:57:30
we went up $50!
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:11:34
ouch, i hope it turns out okay. bitcoin is still pretty unstable but looks like 6k is the bottom for now
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:32:44
bitcoin is retesting 6500 support. let's wish it luck guys :)
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:36:44
ive lost thousands, it's okay :).
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:06:16
mm high-risk high-reward ftw?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:40:11
no clue, i saved up an extra $4200 thanks to crypto. look for good projects and get in early ftw?
@_date: 2018-06-01 00:33:01
i can afford a bitcoin at $11000 but i wouldn't put that much money into crypto...lol...
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:42:02
is there an airdrop for this?
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:03:55
he's right. we only come here for the memes...
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:49:25
Wow we might hit 7k
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:06:18
trade from US to china and vice versa can be expensive...teach me how to avoid this evil tariff xD

@_date: 2018-06-14 13:32:35
the 6500 resistance is tough
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:08:16
Please give advice, I really don't know how. When you make $1000 on an airdrop for 5 seconds of work, or live through an insane bull market where every single coin that shouldn't exist, yet does exist does a x10, how do you break that addiction? :c
I take profits obviously, but I sometimes still kick myself when the price goes up and I sold. Although it's times like this that i'm happy that I took some profits while in the green. It feels like a neverending marry-go-round really. I've lost a couple of thousand here and there, but it's never really affected my bottom line
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:33:31
Good morning to you too :)
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:37:57
it's kinda hard to be a nocoiner really. even if you have 1 penny worth of bitcoin you're a holder...it's not hard to get a penny either
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:48:45
If you turn the bitcoin chart upside down...it's mooning :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:42:50
that sounds hot tho
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:02:41
Good morning friends
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:13:54
mm sideways movement. when breakout / breakdown?

@_date: 2018-06-09 23:57:29
bitcoin is dipping hard
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:04:24
we're mooning! almost 7500 again! :D
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:47:16
why not just hold it &gt; get free airdrops during the year &gt; every single thing in existance goes up when bitcoin moons &gt; profit and sell bitcoin along with 100s of useless tokens and maybe a few $1000 in free airdrop monies &gt; live on a mini-yacht
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:45:51
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:57:07
well bitcoin used to only be for hobbyists and grassroots runners who believed in anti-establishment, now it's mainly about the money and becoming 100% centralized and pumping "big bank" money into it...so...
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:50:15
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:21:53
how many times do you think we're going to dip under 6500 before something major happens? lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:22:49
what if we dip below 6k?
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:28:12
please be careful with localbitcoins, you have to always make sure that a person is on the up and up, same with face to face meetings too
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:02:54
hi. when moon.
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:58:25
bots control the crypto landscape. you should have seen them active in december...good luck getting a trade through without buying upwards or having someone dump a huge amount of money to drive the price down...and that was 90% of altcoins lol
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:36:54
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:24:04
i dont think someone who can influence the market that way cares what me or you think xD
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:46:49
when 2,500.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:14:32
futures =/= positive for bitcoin. it will lead to nothing but problems lol
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:31:23
you guys change sentiment faster than a human torpedo on steroids! not to rain on y'all parade on anything, but has anyone here looked at the fact that bitcoin is at 6100 and not 7000~20,000 and most altcoins are down heavily? lol
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:56:05
ha, i love your analogy about the cows, have an upvote bro
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:17:07
wow under 6k
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:08:03
oh i expected it to go parabolic...you couldnt go 5 seconds without seeing a FOMO headline in the news, so it was prone to crash eventually, the real question was when, after the first "sharp" drop i actually couldn't see it going back up to that point but im happy with december gains, it was fun lol
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:22:46
long read :(

my profit is sitting in the bank thankfully, everything else is ded tho
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:09:53
wait, did you really bet rent and life money on bitcoin?!
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:15:49
morning my friends
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:15:30
I feel like there will probably be another bart pattern soon. everytime it hits 7700, it faces hard rejection
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:17:16
Who is dave?
and congrats :)
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:49:38
buy the dip they said at 20k,19k,18k,17k,16k,15k,14k,13k,12k,11k,10k,9k,8k and now 7k, be careful about buying the dip and DCA :p
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:05:40
nope you're wrong. panic due to straight lines not because of a dump or pump c:
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:39:26
Negative $7000 bitcoin means we owe bitcoin $7000 somehow...mm...my brain hurts trying to figure that one out.
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:04:33
when institutional money meme ultra mega super quadro turbo moon?
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:39:05
but thats what they said about buying the dip at 15k
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:36:37
fiat on the highs, buy buy buy on the lows
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:03:20
^ i've lost thousands that way...cest la vie :)
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:36:03
Whoa...sunlight exists?!.....*goes outside*...dam too bright! it burns!!!! *goes back inside to my mom's basement* nice and cozy. -sleeps in the troll din-

7150! look at bitcoin go! we're gonna make it my friends!
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:30:39
hi can you sell me a bitcoin for 500? :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:37:06
none, i actually sold some of mine (yes, ik it's probably gonna bounce too, so that sucks) to pay for my dental treatments
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:39:48
I'm a man and I don't know any CEOs...and not into guys lol I have a girl in real life I have a crush on, yet i'm too shy to ask her out after 7 years ;)
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:27:00
it was fighting hard at 6500 and its fighting hard at 6400 now, i think it's either going to break through 6000 if we stay at the same support or perhaps go up if we can get some more volume
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:22:21
wow bitcoin just dipped under 6k again?
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:47:38
i'm up like +50% on my "personal goal" since December. I'm down thousands though as a whole -shrugs-
I've lost quite a bit on NANO, but that's the only coin I hold eternally along with some smaller altcoins
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:39:01
Good morning my friends! I hope you have an awesome day :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:48:22
Just woke up and we're dropping again...oh well. Good morning friends :)
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:51:38
always nice to take some profits... i.e sell at 20k, buy at 7k
fiat is stable too
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:11:23
still checking btc to fiat balance is pretty painful considering it was almost 10k like a month ago
huzzah for +5% and -30% xD
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:27:06
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:43:10
pretty sure it was 3 years during the mt.gox thing, bear markets in bitcoin has always seemed to last 1+ year with no consecutive "mooning" year
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:33:44
uh i think everyone just wants to get rich rather than being FUD shills. I'm more pained by seeing my alt -&gt; btc sat balance compared to anything else
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:39:21
this. so much this. except i have one small exception! I want them to send me BTC for every second i'm on the phone with them if i have to get up and answer it. too lazy to bother 90% of the time to even get the phone so it would be a motivator for me, and for them. win-win
Also they don't get the BTC back ;)
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:00:23
when bart to 7000.
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:04:04
when moon
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:47:15
when 20k tho
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:37:25
I thought it was going to the right
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:08:35
But I need money to pay for school and life lol
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:58:23
actually it's constantly dipping below 6500, dunno if thats good or bad though
it's like there's an epic battle going on for 6500 on gdax lol
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:36:43
the end is soon! the only question is how :)
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:13:12
i think we might go to 7k and (hopefully not and I hope i'm wrong), come back down to 6k
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:35:05
your post made me hungry...and it's 3 am :(
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:06:42
$100 doesn't make much of a difference through for 7000 or 8000...that's like a $10 +/- diff worth of bitcoin? lol i think long-term is key and whether it breaks through 10k or 6k
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:49:08
we dropped under 6500 support
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:01:35
true :), I'm out of around 30% of my BTC because of it, but I still have some ETC and NANO that i'm holding onto for the future. It's a bit smaller (especially since i brought early in the year), but I'm really hoping that it can make up for it in the future
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:08:12
im hoping for a rally to 20k!
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:08:34
i use wells fargo and jp morgan and both have banned my credit cards from buying crypto. which is ironic since I wouldn't ever max them out on crypto and have been responsible for years...unless I saw the 2017 bullrun coming...then...yeaaahhh lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:08:21
ive never drink before and i dont have a girlfriend, do i win? :)
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:33:08
7500...hi again my old friend.
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:27:20
going back to 6k i bet lol
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:49:09
but what if your bank gives you 5% compound interest safely?
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:01:58
wow woke up to 6300
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:18:45
we broke 6500 support! good or bad sign?
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:33:17
Good morning friends
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:44:04
stop lying to that poor guy! 100k is impossible, bitcoin is too good! bitcoin is going to be 1,000,012.53 on exactly Dec 31st, 2018 at 11:59:59 PM! you heard it here first folks!
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:04:02
Bitcoin has "died" over 300 times at this point. But what people fail to realize is that adoption is increasing. With adoption, more people will invest which means that people become less reliant on banks. Cryptocurrency is the future :).
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:25:08
it broke through but now it's barting lol
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:34:43
no idea what the point of bashing bcash and btc are. I got an airdrop and just holding both. If BTC drops, bcash goes with it alongside everything else. Shouldn't people want both to succeed?
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:38:31
how? i never invest more than I can afford to lose :(
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:27:29
-good vibes goes here-
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:17:49
the ironic part is 2% is like....15 seconds in the crypto world, if I went mainly to stocks, I would be so bored lol
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:02:29
we bart'd :(
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:43:14
we dropped to 6500 tho
@_date: 2018-07-02 10:54:44
not a scam but not worth it either. All it means is that your ip address was blacklisted (happens to me sometimes when making a new account), basically just change your IP address and make a new account and it should work i think
@_date: 2018-07-02 18:40:46
but the green candle is tiny tho
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:42:54
as along as it's not wells fargo, knowing them they won't ever let me touch my bitcoin, let alone keep a few K in the account without being treated like a criminal of my own money. true story there too...
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:15:36
im scared of life and where my life is going, i guess i better hold onto my bitcoins....please don't let me down in the near-far future bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:06:00
ya its manipulation, happens on all exchanges really
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:05:18
or $2.5k or even $2.5 million :)
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:20:21
Sorry bro I can only read English and Japanese =(
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:41:59
made more off of housing and crypto...sooo
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:33:06
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:53:12
but seriously...what is the number for bitcoin? i want a refund for all the money i lost on every btc trade I brought high. They should give it to me since im a good customer and I'll burn up their phone line until i get it! *rageface goes here* lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:54:51
we pumped down to 6584 at the time of writing this.
