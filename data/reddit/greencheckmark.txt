If the blocks are bigger it makes the spam attack like 10x-20x more expensive and that'll make people think twice about doing it.

That is true. Really Bitcoin is fucked. Short it to the ground once the greedy people are all bought in.

Maybe they got a long position in LTC and trying to get more people to switch to LTC. LTC up 7% and BTC down 1%
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:24:57
It isn't a good idea. But what happens if we never do anything and then Big Banks coordinate an attack and can afford to blow 20 BTC a day to bring the network to a crawl for months at a time.

Just move the $15,000,000 to an exchange and set up a buy order. Wait for people to sell into you. Boom 50,000 btc in your account.

Price bounces back after they somehow bought the bottom everytime.

US Government Bitcoin spying spreading around the world. Uncle Sam wants to know when you buy BTC and will watch where they go.

Ah bummer. Guess I can't expect LTC to randomly pump 300% more on a Coinbase add. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:48:48
That's because they are quietly accumulating LTC before announcing they are diversifying and are backing Litecoin.

Willy bot was made so the early adopters could get out at a high price. Now we have 18 months worth of people that bought higher than the price is now. Can we trust 18 months worth of buying won't start selling under $200
Shit is doomed once people start dumping their thousands of bitcoins they bought high. 
People buy at $250 thinking they got a deal but then dump at $200
People buy at $200 dump at $150
$150 to $100
Never ending.

It gets the same China manipulation Btc gets. Once OKCoin goes down Ltc will too.

There is a 73,000 transaction backlog. It was under 1,000 transactions earlier today. So someone making a lot of transactions. Or "stressing" as you would put it.

It went up in 2013 thanks to being one of the few altcoins and the main one on BTC-e. Other exchanges added it and LTC got a few pumps thanks to that. 
Now ~18 months later after going down there are numerous other coins. 
If BTC goes up I would watch the LTC/BTC ratio. I predict it'll drop. With so many other coins it makes no sense for people to bail out the bagholders and pump millions into it when there are other coins now that can be bought. People are deep in DASH, XMR and other altcoins now. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:45:52
In 1 month the price should be higher than it is now. Otherwise it won't be good.

Looks like they added some more text.

A wallet can contain many addresses. It's just a bad way to tell. A lot of stuff can be faked to make bitcoin look healthy.

Wallets for different companies like Circle, Coinbase, Blockchain.

Who knows how much Gox helped the price from when it was just pennies to over $1,000 but most people will agree it probably ends up being a good thing / helping the coin long term showing it can withstand anything.

Rarely does price keep going up after going up 5 days in a row. Price will go back up now that it had time to correct.
@_date: 2015-02-19 05:27:05
This person needs more hopium. Bitcoin is going to sky rocket. People want to make money and the only way is to buy bitcoin and sell it higher. That's why we are all buying in and going long before everyone else does.

Retire. I'll short bitcoin so much that at the bottom I can long it with the bitcoins I made shorting it and just cash it all out on the remaining believers and do whatever till I die.

Good. Keep the noobs out. The smart people will get rich and leave the dumb people behind.
