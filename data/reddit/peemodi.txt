Tl;dr - Nobody here has any clue how this is going to affect the current Bitcoin market/prices. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:05:53
So in this case, 319.68 bitcoins have to be bought first, and then the price will rise? What is the objective here? 
Also, what are the numbers on the "y axis" referring to? Thanks.

Today I'm officially unsubscribing from this sub. -.-

No one would have invested $10,000 into Bitcoins 7 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:01:48
Thanks! :)

I meant the users/customers. And true, I agree. I guess as Bitcoin becomes more popular, people that want to get in easy will probably look towards cloud mining. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:13:50
Makes sense. Thank you. This was very helpful. :)

Same man, same. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:10:23
Need to know this as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:22:59
So you know how shit works, right? Why don't you enlighten the OP then?
How is someone supposed to gain knowledge about a certain topic if other people just put them down? Makes no sense. Did you magically know everything about the market as soon as you came out of the womb?

Article was published on November 4th, 2015. Oh, the irony!

I'm just going to leave this here: 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:12:13
OP is asking a question/wants to engage in a meaningful discussion. If you have something to contribute, why don't you? Instead of acting tough.

Hmm, yeap that's gonna be a no from me dawg.

One more question: What does the "USD Spread" under Order Books refer to? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:11
Not too sure about the 1st question. But if you're not buying large amounts of crypto, then Coinbase's default wallet is just fine. Otherwise consider buying a Hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S.

I am in a very similar situation myself. What is the best platform to purchase btc for someone in the US? Considering transaction fees and all. Currently looking at Kraken. Any advice is welcome. Thank you. :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:58:21
Yeap. Bought them for like $5 each back in the day to use on SilkRoad. Def regretting now. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:10:40
Perfect. So basically until that order is fulfilled, the price wont rise, correct? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:45:31
How should one interpret the order book to "read" the market? 
"You really need to piece together many variables in order to trade." What are some obvious variables? 
Thanks!

Yes.

Would like to know the same. Upvoted for visibility. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:20:24
What are some good suggestions? Currently just using Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:14:15
Coinbase is up again. Give it another try. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:56:33
So wait, how can whales "set" a wall without actually buying or selling? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:31:11
Saw this too! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:37:08
Reduced fees for customers.
