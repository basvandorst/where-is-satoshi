Last year Morgan Stanley had to pay 2.6 billion dollars for fraud. Maybe we should listen to other financial advisors that aren't so full of shit.

Ty Joel for trying to help out. You called someone else. I was able to get a lecture about Bitcoin scams and fraud from your coworker. She was able to find the error and helped me redeem. We can call it human error or machine error.  Issue was resolved under 24 hrs so I really have to thank you and everyone who helped.

Cash app isn't perfect yet. I liked it at first then had to deal with several customer support agents on how to type decimals correctly. Some of my friends love it, others loathe it. Reviews on Google store are very bad. I assumed most were fake, but there sure are alot of bad reviews. If one more exchange costs me time and money, I will return to the John Wick lifestyle and collect gold.
