I'm not downvoting you. Glad you think there's some kind of correlation between like minded people and whatever mental illness you have that makes you think you're psychic. Get help. Serious help.

I do. Sometimes rubbing their face in their own shit is the only way they'll learn.

I'm not insecure. I just like laughing at stupid people after they've paraded around how rich they're going to be when they don't understand financial markets. they deserve it.

You sound super fucking scathing mad, home skillet.

It was a joke. Did you not read all these comments and think I was being serious? How stupid are you?

You're sweating now.

well when you try to ban subreddits like thedonald (numerous petitions on here...so much for freedom of expression of political background amirite) or safe havens for addicts who want to safely order drugs so they dont have to go on the street to get it like (same thing that government sanctioned clinics do) but keep far leaning left and circle jerk subs teetering (or completely fallen off into insanity) like or where they literally post fake texts claiming to be from men or make fun of lonely ugly men...it kinda shows you where this site is headed. into the ground. its being run by waaaay left sjw libtards and feminazis because quite frankly, that's what mainstream media and it's supporters are behind now. that's what seems to be the norm. anything that doesn't quite fit with their agenda is banned. what they dont understand is the same subreddits they're banning housed the same kind of people that truly make the internet run. the ones that actually understand what's going on. i really think when the final nail is in the coffin it will give rise to a new birth of internet forums, hearkening back to the good old days that most millenials and libtard feminazis never knew existed before their compact makeup edition of the internet was introduced through reddit. how anti american is that? then again america hasn't been about freedom in almost 300 years. it's about corporate shilling now. whoever has the money can line the pockets of legislatures. reddit has become so powerful in the US internet market it's not really surprising they'd be doing what they are now. the sad thing is they could gone the other way. i guess that's what TOR and niche forums are for. so much for thinking a random joe like myself could consolidate all of his interests...even if it included finding out where to buy drugs from on a singular site like reddit. foolish me for thinking i had that kind of freedom on the internet.
[edit] honestly i think reddit has run it's course and it's got 5-10 years MAX before it's a 404 on your browser. they're trying to trim the fat and water down the community so it's investor friendly so when it goes public it makes everybody a shitload of money and then they can just ride it out till some major media conglomerate buys it out and all the silicon valley sjws that run this site can sip mimosas on their porches watching the sunset and laugh about how they took people's hard work at building subreddit communities and pooling resources and information and ran it into the ground for lulz and $$. fuck reddit. seriously. this isn't what the internet is supposed to be about. it's like it was a trap all along. "lets funnel 90% of internet traffic from the US through our site, we'll let anybody make a community about whatever until we get enough exposure from major big swingers in the media/financial biz...then we'll do a 180 and claim some sort of faux moral superiority via "updated community guidelines" purging these communities and then cash out while the getting's good."
  
it's sickening.

they've gotta know killing off these subs isn't going to end well for them. to hell with going public and all. reddit first existed to bring everyone together, regardless of what you did. now that it's become some libtard cookie cutter "front page of the internet" you will literally find nothing good on here outside of stupid imgur reposts and dad jokes. all good things must come to end i suppose...but it'll hurt them in the end when people who came here for the subreddits wont ever be back. you may think it's not going to be a sizeable portion of people but im telling you...the higher ups will notice a decrease in traffic. it has happened to almost every other social media site in existence. they are making the same mistakes digg did.

you don't seem to understand the pipe dream fantasies people have when they think of crypto and "economic freedom"
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:53:47
Same as the idiots running around claiming to be sovereign citizens.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:47:26
How's that economic freedom when it's getting taxed to oblivion?
