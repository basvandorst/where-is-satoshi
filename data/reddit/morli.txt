Lol at calling USD an alt. Delusional much?
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:01:51
Actually been holding crypto and btc for years. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:02:34
You really consider usd less prominent than bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:13:04
K. Then don’t try to rush into calling usd an alt. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:15:18
I did the best job. It’s great. I also deserve attention!
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:07:56
Well I work and file a salary as well as bitcoin so for me it’s quite a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:42
I’m not on either side really, just an investor and believer in crypto, but I do truly believe bitcoin is in trouble for the reasons stated here. So it would be awesome if any real info could be shared. As it stands it is a slow, expensive process to use bitcoin and the details on the timeline of lightning aren’t available or clear. I would love to be convinced that bitcoin could still work out but it’s getting harder and harder to believe, and these weaknesses are getting pointed out on CNBC and Bloomberg, etc for the first time because now they actually care do the the price changes. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:22:10
By listing a coin you don’t like?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:04:40
Move. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:52
Well given that the largest crypto exchange now has it listed clearly as Bitcoin Cash on their front page and charts I’d say it’s been decided. If you are tired of playing the name war, stop playing it. You’re the one trying to change its name or suggest it needs to be changed. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:49:40
TIL expressing legit concerns about real problems is an attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:16:02
Yeah, so I had heard. But where is info about it posted? When is it expected to be working?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:45:38
Well the IRS demanded Coinbase to hand over all their data on users and transactions a few days ago for instance. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:11:27
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:03:04
What is that supposed to mean, not a high percentage?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:47
Gonna be waiting a good while for that lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:27:10
What attack
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:33:30
Didn’t core devs themselves say there is no point to using segwit
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:56:08
The problem with that was that simply defending the idea that bitcoin should support bigger block sizes/pushing for that in discussions was construed as promoting an altcoin at the time and did result in bans. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:17:23
The sub started before bch was a thing. It was meant to be an alternative uncensored discussion about bitcoin. It was a sub where you wouldn’t be banned for having different ideas about block sizes. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:51:37
No one should think Wright is legit. I hold BCH and BTC,  I visit r/bch frequently and I can tell you Wright is a miserable liar and human being. 
Ver, well he’s just not very socially skilled. But he just believes what he believes in. Eh. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:33:01
I don’t understand how to use/not use segwit, and I sure don’t understand using Lightning, at all. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 02:14:49
Forgot the yacht to the very right. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:54:42
Coinbase deletes accounts, freezes transfers, sometimes forgets or loses transactions. There are many threads on here about it. It's also buggy. I often get massive slowdown using the interface. To buy ethereum weekly automatically I had to set it to buy bitcoin to my ethereum wallet (wtf). That being said it's the only one I've found with an automated recurring buy function so I use it for a small recurring buy. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:09:14
I assume that's why they have the feedback system. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:48:38
What? I am saying that is why people wanted this. It's not really possible right now to have this inside a IRA. I am just one example of someone who would have made use of such an ETF. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:35:33
4%? Do you buy with a credit card or something? It's 1.5% from bank. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:42:48
I have a lot of funds in my retirement accounts I could allocate to bitcoin. I have very little just sitting in a bank account I could do that with. Make sense?
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:39:13
"Actually this is good..."
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:52:07
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:47:03
There was an agreement to move ahead with segwit 2x. It took a long time to reach. This OP and others don't know what an agreement means. That about sums it up. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:07:16
I love what this community has become. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:38:21
Next time I recommend just holding and then buying more if there is a correction. Timing both the high and the low isn't really possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:46:05
There was an agreement for a reason. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:21:56
Sure. Then I am taxed though. So not the best option. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:33:59
Haven't received yet. I just meant I ordered one (paid with bitcoin)
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:38:16
Neither via coinbase which is what your screenshots are made from ;). 3% in fees when it's all said and done. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:19:49
Gemeni doesn't have a recurring Buy function. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:33:05
Then get ready to potentially lose most of your savings. I guess you can only learn through experience what it's like to hold a worthless thing and know it will never come back to what you paid or even close. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:26:02
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:15:47
I got a nano S, my first wallet and it's great. Recommended. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:35:46
I picked up a ledger nano S
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:21:38
What about apps like breadwallet? What if I use one and it gets pulled from App Store? Does the "backup" still work?
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:35:24
That sounds terrible. I've gone ahead and picked up a ledger nano s
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:21:04
What about apps like breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:42:42
Where did these come from? The website has not offered much for a long time, just come cheap aluminum ones for sale at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:20:41
1. You never know how long the next drop will take to come. 
2. You don't know how big of a drop it will be. 
Thus, even if you wait for it and it does happen it might not be less costly than right now. Invest your 1k over a few weeks to average your cost and just hold it. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:30:20
Sure. Some things to note: you can pay like 1/3 the fee or less on Gemini or other exchanges, although they don't have recurring Buy so you have to do it yourself. Coinbase is about 3% if you buy and then sell which is a lot in my opinion but to each their own. Also, you should be aware that you shouldn't hold lots of funds in coinbase. Send the bitcoins to a hardware wallet for safer storage. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:54:10
This is not my point. The point is I am taxed when I withdraw from the retirement account. Before I do anything with the withdrawn money. What I want to do is leave it in the account but have exposure to BTC. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:49:09
It just makes me nervous to see wallets being taken off the App Store sometimes. If that happens, you are saying my paper backup would allow me to access the same coins?
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:57:37
Ads. Your pic gets viewed and an ad is also shown on the same page. Got a popular pic? $$$. No idea if it's actually worth trying though. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:53:22
If you want to take a risk put some % of your savings into BTC but not 80%. Put 20% if you like. Find other ways to diversify the rest such as VTI, total stock index etf. And do keep some % in cash or short term bond etf so you can buy something with that money when it crashes. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:49:11
They charge 1.49% for selling, too. So all told you pay nearly 3% on a buy/sell scenario. I switched to Gemini. I just wish it had recurring auto buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:15
I’m pretty sure if you could get it done in 3 months Elon fucking Musk can figure it out. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:20:58
Garbage post. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:17:51
Is this going to be something users need to enable or is it going to help anyone who uses bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:40:56
Lol “manipulate the community to support a malicious fork” - only manipulation I’ve seen is right here where mods control the conversation. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:39:40
I’m more interested in this from a market perspective. If users have to do obscure things to activate it then it won’t have a positive impact on the price or adoption. It sounds like right now that’s the case, maybe in the future the major wallets will support it by default or make it easier to enable. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:03:55
So does this already work with my regular bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:58:33
When this was written bitcoin actually worked as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:16:22
Use the money to have experiences rather than to buy things. You have time now since you don't have to work full time. Travel. Try new things. Those will bring you much more happiness than buying shit. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:41:12
Do they have recurring buy?
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:39:49
This will probably get buried but is the truth. r/btc started before bitcoin cash ever existed, and was an alternative to the one sided discussion here. It originally was more about block size debate and not bch specifically. 
Anyone saying it was created for bch and to mislead people is wrong. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 06:23:24
They don't have recurring transactions... I couldn't believe this but it's true.  You can't schedule weekly or monthly buys.
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:08:20
What you would want is a good low cost etf directly based on bitcoins. That doesn't exist yet. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:52:42
Bot, you should of realized this was a joke. And the joke is on you. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:18:04
Yes. Yes I did. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:20:24
I bought in at 108
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:51:23
"Everything's fine..."
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:47:56
Huh? You mean I should have? I did actually. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:43:19
Gbtc is risky because bitcoin is risky to begin with and then you have a premium. No doubts there. But it's misleading to essentially say that ETFs shouldn't be held. That's why I'm correcting here for others' reference in the future who are learning about ETFs and investing. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:24:41
There is nothing risky about an ETF just because it's an ETF. An ETF is just a way to contain assets and trade them. There are ETFs that function exactly like mutual funds, and have all the same risk/lack of risk, often with lower fees. Some ETFs are just safe bond allocations for example. Just because there are crazy leveraged ETFs doesn't mean they are all like that.
