This reminded me to the past movements, so I've made a little crosscorrelation test algorithm, and the result is the following:
* ATH:       2015 nov  4   ($512)
* Dipbottom: 2015 nov 12   ($316) -38%
* Recovery:  2015 dec 19   ($471) +49%
* Dipbottom: 2016 jan 16   ($370) -21%
* New ATH:   2016 maj 29   ($520) 
* --------------------------------------
* ATH:       2017 jan  4  ($1122)
* Dipbottom: 2017 jan 11   ($767) -31%
* Recovery:  2017 feb  8  ($1072) +38%
* Dipbottom: 2017 feb  9   ($952) -11%
* New ATH:   2017 feb 22  ($1126)
* --------------------------------------
* ATH:       2017 dec 17 ($19441)
* Dipbottom: 2017 dec 22 ($11774) -39%
* Recovery:  2018 jan  7 ($17113) +45%
* Dipbottom: 2018 jan 16 ($11513) -32%
* New ATH:   ?
I correlated the last 3 month with the last 4 year's chart, and the coefficient was always above 0.9 about the end of the years, so yes, it's just the usual pattern happening every year.

This is not entirely true, if i start a service tomorrow with mutual wallet it is not known, but may be part of tracing. This can happen any day countless times, because anyone anytime can launch a service like this. This is why tainting is useless.
Btw if well known mutual wallets are not source of taint, then it is one more reason why tainting is useless, because anyone who has tainted coins can send it to the well known service, where is loses its taint, and withdraw it afterwards, maybe tainted coins maybe clean ones.
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:20:28

@_date: 2018-05-22 17:15:52
That can happen any time at every services that uses a mutual wallet, so you can withdraw coins that was not yours before. This is why tainting has no point, sooner or later (almost) all wallets will be tainted if you are not just sitting on the coins, but spending it, buying it, selling it, exchanging, so using it.
And this is why i'm not worried, because tainting is not really a proper way to determine if someone is a criminal or not, it is just guessing without information.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:13:50
That business might be worth much, but it's still just guessing and approximation. If you send coins to a service's mutual wallet and then withdraw with some time and amount difference to new addresses then the only entity that can reveal the truth is that service, and if they don't record the ip/coin address/txids or not having any transaction log of the user who has deposited the tainted coins and withdrew the cleanones, or just not providing it to the authorities, then you can do any magic, the trace has been lost.
That business is just doing approximation by analysing addresses and searching for similar movements, but as an evidence it is very weak.

Decentralization is a good thing, but can not serve everything we need.
Decentralization is not able to commit/process multiple changes in the system fast, but in other hand, it can do it more safe.
This is the two arms of the scale, fast or safe. A lot of traders and bots require more efficient way to get the information about the market, the changes of the orderbook, or processing the information about the committed trades, this must be happen under milliseconds. This is something that a decentralized exchange simply (maybe yet) can not serve, because it needs to distribute the information to the all nodes, they have to verify, everything slows down because of the synchronization.
If you are exchanging assets 1-2 times a day and your point is to just have the other asset maybe because you just want to spend or hold it, then a decentralized exchange may be ok for you, but if you place, move, cancel orders 1000+ times a day, and you want to see the price and volume moves, order changes immediately to analyze the movements, then a decentralized exchange is definitely not the one you are looking for.
Centralized solutions can skip a lot of job in their inner workflow because the software is running in one place, a "secured" place, so communication between the modules of the software or databases must not be checked and validated every single time when something happens, decentralized solutions must check every single happening in the software and validate the messages between the nodes, because none of them trust any of them.
Both solutions have their own benefits and disadvantages and both have their right usage. You just can't have both in the same time yet.

Ubuntu is a good choice, but I can not tell much about the Core, I investigated a few times the source code, but it is a very complex program and has a lot of modules, each of them do different things, it is depending on the specific job how are they use threading.
For example it may use multithreading for hash calculations, or even use built-in CPU hashing units, but it is not just all about hashing. There are countless way to implement a method and it has a lot of them. You better ask a Core developer about this question, but actually it is not that important to know what You want to know.
I mean go with HT CPU, and then You won't miss anything. Core should not create such a huge load while verifying transactions. Blockchain downloading is more about the bandwidth You have, You have to verify it only once when You download it, that is a relatively huge job for the CPU, but only because of the large amount of data, not because it is hard on the CPU. The storage device latency and bus bandwidth is more important. If You have an SSD with SATA3 or PCIe connection (nvme), then it won't be a bottleneck either.
After downloading and verifying the complete chain Your computer has to process only the new transactions and blocks, but it is not a huge amount of data, even a Raspberry Pi can do it with no problem.

I'm a developer and I mostly program multi-threaded applications. Let me explain a bit the difference between the CPUs:
The Hyper-Threading Technology (that Intel uses) is a mechanism that splits one physical core to two pseudo-cores. By this the operation system can assign more threads to each physical cores, but every second "core" has to share the cache memory and the instruction processing units with the first "cores", and this context-switching is happening in the very CPU-close hardware level, rather than the software level, the latter is a lot slower.
This is beneficial in several ways, and drawback in others. All is up to the software developer how these technologies are used. Non Hyper-Threading Technology cores perform a lot better than HT enabled cores, because less software threads are assigned to them, they do less context-switching (switching between threads there and back, this is always an expensive thing to do), they share less cache memory with other procedures, therefore less data copy between system memory and cache memory must be happen, but in a situation when way more threads are running than physical cores are present they have to do many context-switchings. On the other hand, HT enabled cores do these context-switching better, but they share performance and cache. This is why core count and cache size (not the shared cache, but the core-dedicated cache) matters more than HT. But we can say HT enabled CPU performance is better.
There are specific situations when single core performance matters and there are situations when context-switching is more important and overall performance increases with HT enabled.
I have three different computers (i5 4460, i7 4790, i9 7900x) for different tasks, but I test my applications on all of them, because of performance benchmarking, what I say here is based on my experience. In specific workloads the i5 overperforms the i7 even though they have very similar cores, just i7 is HT enabled, so the OS thinks it can assing more threads to the cores. Sometimes it is bad.
So back to Your question: There is no answer to it, because it depends on the software You want to run to process the blockchains how can they process them, are they single or multi-threading applications, what OS You use, and how they are optimized to the architectures. Many many open questions without easy answers.
I suggest You go with HT enabled core CPU because
1. You can disable HT any time in the BIOS if You want, but
2. Usually You never want to disable HT, and
3. I experienced +25 to +75% performance with HT enabled CPUs with multi-threaded applications, even though they don't have as many physical cores as they show, and
4. Nowdays all OS and applications use multi-threading very well and this direction will not change in the near future.
Sorry for the long answer, but there is no short answer.

Creating a miner with air cooling and aftermarket modding to water cooling will always be more expensive. I'm talking about if they are producing the miner with water cooling blocks already. There is many hundred hashing chips in an S9 with individual heatsinks made probably of aluminum. If instead of the hundreds of heatsinks they used 6 specialized water blocks to cover all chips, then the production wouldn't be much more expensive (it can happen to be more cheap).
@_date: 2018-06-10 14:19:09
Normally blocks are mined in every 10 minute. This is approximately set by the difficulty algorithm. It detects the hashrate power on the network and sets the difficulty to make blocks be mined periodically. If the hashing power goes up blocks will be mined more often, but the algorithm will detect this and set the difficulty higher, so they will come again in every 10 minutes.
If you have more mining power then it will result in blocks will be mined more often than 10 minutes, that makes you get the block reward more often - lets say every 8 minutes -, but after the next difficulty adjustment despite the higher power you can find blocks approximately in every 10 minutes again. So until the next adjustment you can gain a little extra profit, then everything will be the same as now.
Blocks in every 10 minutes, 12.5BTC/block reward, until the next halvening.

You can not print an NFC device on paper and show it for payment or something else, QR code is a cool thing, but actually even if it is all numeric and checksumed it turned out for me it is not really safe.
I recently programmed a QR code scanner and it turned out if the resolution was not enough or the camera was not really focused then it could scan and passed the crc checking but with false data. Sometimes 1-2 characters were wrong, and this made me worry, because the fault was not in the code. When changed to higher resolution camera and never let make blurry picture it always worked fine, but about 3 from 100 scans caused faulty results (only with blurry picture).
This was worked around with making multiple scans and check which of them passed the crc checking the most, but this is still not a good solution, the crc checking algorithm is weak.
An advice: When scanning qr codes always check the result and match the addresses before the transaction, do not rely on the scanner!

Btw just because risc is saying their instruction code is open source it does not mean they can not have undocumented instructions or hidden devices in the chip. I've downloaded a lot of Intel CPU datasheets, they are thousand pages long, they write everything about the CPU in tons of details, but there is not a single word about the Management Engine, even though it is there.
Trust is needed if you use a chip manufactured by anybody else than you. This is not a simple situation. At least Intel has so widespread use people could find the backdoor and found a solution how to disable it.

It can not be disabled in software level because it is running in ring -3, a level where there is no user access, initialization is happening during the boot process on hardware level.

I'm talking about the hardware, you never know if there is a backdoor hardcoded in the chips. In this particular case the Intel CPU itself is not capable to run the backdoor alone, the mainboard and the BIOS is also needed. Especially because the ME firmware is completely in the BIOS.
Using different architecture does not guarantee that you are safe from backdoors, because if there is no backdoor in the CPU itself, there can be in the memory/data bus/etc controlling device chip, right next to the CPU.
An x86 based computer does not need to boot into the OS (therefore it does not matter you are using opensource software only, because you do not get to the point to run any software yet) to have the ME backdoor working. It happens before the user software level.
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:48:38

Such devices use MCU's instead of CPU's, they are a completely different thing. Such backdoor as ME needs a bit larger architecture than a custom made device. But this does not mean there can not be backdoor in the chip, but it would be much much harder to gain access to the backdoor itself than with a personal computer. I wouldn't take it a serious security risk.

Intel ME is standing from two parts: A specialized MCU inside the CPU, it is the hardware, and ME software that runs on it.
The software is not in the CPU, upon startup the software has to be loaded to the MCU otherwise the system won't start, or will, but will shut down after about 30 minutes.
The ME software is in the BIOS. When powering up a computer the BIOS initializes the ME engine. A lot of research happened to decompile the ME software without luck, but it has been reverse engineered to some level.
That level is more than enough to disable it.
Removing not the complete but specific parts in the ME firmware and recalculating the checksums it is able to initialize the ME MCU only that much, to make the computer believe ME is running, but actually all important modules are completely removed (host device drivers, network drivers, etc...), so can not do anything, therefore not working at all, but letting the computer run.
It also sets the "government bit", that is a flag in the ME system to set if the computer is owned and used by the government, because if this bit is set, then it does the same as above, let the computer start up and then disable ME.
This hack actually let anyone to not just enable the government bit flag, but actually delete the modules from the ME firmware.
I personally could remove ME and set the govt bit in 4 laptops and 3 desktop computers. After removing ME, under windows the Intel ME driver did not found the ME hardware and under linux some specific PCI buses (that are simulated to communicate with ME) has completely disappeared, and any ME checker software (even the authentic Intel) reported that the computer is not ME compatible and even the "undocumented, hacked" commands didn't result in any respond.
[This project from GitHub]( completely solves the problem, but it is not enough to compile and run this script, I actually had to remove the BIOS flash from the motherboards (laptops usually need desoldering and resoldering, desktop PC's usually have socket for the chip), and connect it to a Raspberry PI GPIO pins to safely download/reprogram/verify the patched BIOS firmware.
It IS possible to disable Intel ME, and this is still better than trying completely different architecture (like Risc/ARM/AMD) without any information what hidden device it has!
Intel has fucked up, but at least got some attention and a solution was released. Other devices are still shady af.
(After patching the BIOS forget the BIOS updates, or after update you have to patch it again, but there is a chance it won't work, then you have to move back to the previous working version.)

Either You choose, pay attention to have original sealing (probably holographic sticker on the box), so it has never been opened before, otherwise You may get an already used/hacked device, risking losing all funds later.
It is a known scam people hack it and repack and they try to use very convincing sealing/paint on the scrapable paper. Buy only from trusted seller (best is the manufacturer)! If it happens You buy one second hand the first step should be making a complete factory reset/clearing everything from the device and a firmware update first, but it still might be hacked by hardware.
I can not tell much about Ledger, but Trezor works fine, never experienced any problem, or have seen people complain about it.

[I made this graph]( just to check if my idea is right, it seems it is, even though it does not correlate perfectly. Probably after the hashwar things get better.

Tethering may work via bluetooth/wifi, just if you buy a smartphone second hand, reinstall the original operation system by full factory reset, to make sure there is no any backdoor apps installed, otherwise you risk losing your funds.
Btw atms usually use wifi of the location, there might be free wifi access, ie if the location is a coffee bar or something...

You seem like a typical torrent leecher, without any intention to seed back. In my view, if you have chance to support the network but you are not doing it you don't deserve to use it. In an abstract way everone get paid for running a node, by being able to use the network. If everyone would think like you, then the network wouldn't exist.

First rule of drawing support/resist lines is never force them on the chart to fulfill a theory, just draw them on the exact points determined by the rules of drawing these lines, and then get to conclusion, if there is any.

Sooner or later it will stabilize, but that will be a very long run. People want everything nowdays immediately, as much as possible, which makes them greedy af, but this type of mentality easily could cause the death of an invention, if the ignorance will cause misusage. If it can and will survive this misusage and series of bubbles it will survive everything.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:27:21
It much more seems like series of bubbles, and it actually would not be a bubble if people are not making a bubble out of it. So technically it is not a bubble, but actually the speculative market built on it has repeating bubbles, based on the ignorance and greed.

Half the ATH? Yes. Is that a problem? No. ATH is just a moment when it reached a specific value, but it's not the nominal value. ATH is a nice thing, but it says nothing, since the mean/average is the important in trend, and 10k is way over of the mean what it should be if it is not an uptrend. 7k would be the mean now. Does this mean something? Yes, this means it is in a strong growing trend. People think about ATH's like it supposed to be the absolute minimum value after reaching it, it's so immature to think like this.
If a sportsman was a few times 1st in races and after that a few times just 2nd or 3rd does that mean he is bad at sports? He can be 1st again. Think this way, he might be the 1st again.

If that will happen to make it somewhat official it has to happen on an exchange, but you can not buy for higher price than the actual order is, so there has to be sell order for $1M, but all other coins under that price has to be bought, so let put some BTC to all exchanges for $0.99M for sale.

I did not read the complete article because I have no time for that, and I do not want to shill or attack anyone, but I don't understand the whole bitching about a free market being free market.
A centralized 3rd party exchange is what it is. Even though people don't like it, it still is.
The all crypto thing is about being anonymous and not being exposed. Using a centralized entity in any way and trading using it's help is actually transacting with the exchange and asking the exchange to transact with others, so actually people are not trading with individual peers, they are trading with the exchange, that is the peer.
Asking for this peer to expose itself and make it's working completely transparent is like asking for personal information from the peer you are transacting with. If people are against for KYC, they should not ask for the other peer - the exchange - to be exposed either.
This is a free market, everyone is doing what they want, and nobody is pushed to do anything what they don't want. If an entity acts in an unacceptable way, then You don't participate in it's business, but if it does and You accept the risk, then You also accept the fact things might go either way, and hope for the best.
This all should be about businesses - like exchanges - building (and/or destroying) reputation, and letting the peers having the decision if they trust them or not.
I still think this all is about being free and now I see more and more people asking for regulations. TF man?
This more or less seems like the family guy episode when they decide to overthrow the system and live free and they realize at the end they need to build a completely same system they lived in before to make the things work out.
