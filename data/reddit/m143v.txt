What addresses got the money?

You say "you will lose your money" with absolutely no basis. Additionally, notice how the site has sessions in case you reload the page, and it gives you the same information. Perhaps, it is meant to ensure people don't lose their original key. Furthermore, the double spend happens immediately after you send to your wallet, to addresses the site doesn't control, so again, your summation is baseless.
Sure, the service is new, but that doesn't mean you will lose funds. Time will tell, I suppose.

You don't double spend if you win. You only double spend if you lose... Ideally, if someone won, they would just wait for a confirmation, then withdraw.

Maybe someone else should make a better one. Would love to check that out.

There is ALOT of volume on the blockchain right now with high fees. I also have a transaction with a high priority fee of .0001 for a 250kb transaction and it's been 2 hours. This happens occasionally when traffic is through the roof.

Actually, this is inaccurate.  A key is created each session.... Unless you reload a session. I'm not sure why everyone wants this to be a scam. Additionally, if you test that information in your pictures, it will all check out.... Nothing is hard coded, but there seems to be a real desire for this not to be legit.

sorry... 250 bytes.

The doublespend.me spender doesn't work anymore because it uses the blockchain.info api to push transactions and they disallow attempts. Also, Glass Hunt gives you your private key for the first transaction and don't control any of the accounts you send to.
