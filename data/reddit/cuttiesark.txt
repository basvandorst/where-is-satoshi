This is why I left LinkedIn, these charlatans are cancer that get into any ecosystem or emerging tech and spread.
The other worrying thing is being human, when one stupid person sees this shit they then go an copy it, multiplying the problem.
I've seen it with other things like GDPR ("GDPR consultant"), Big data and Social Media Analytics.

You can get PostgreSQL which has the features of Oracle DB without the crazy license.

Oracle Enterprise Linux is a bastardization of RHEL which they then forced on customers who were migrating to x86 from Sun.

Regardless of the movie itself, the battle of Thermopylae, although a showcase of Spartan heroics, was a failure and Xerxes went on to capture Athens and many regions of Greece.
Not sure this is a good metaphor Op....

Oracle can kindly stay the hell away from BTC and ETH. 
They have a track record of ruining software by hostile takeover:
* Java
* Solaris / GNU / Redhat
* MySQL
* Siebel CRM
Also being an Oracle customer, having one of their so called consultants flown in to change a config charging £500/day for the privilege.

A pull request?

Ok, but that still doesn't change the fact that consultants are overpaid and a concept that should be removed from management along with outsourcing.
Instead of training up the in house staff on the tech, senior management seem to think its more "cost effective" to bring in consultants to do the job...

Mate I worked at a big corporation in the UK, it took us 2 years to upgrade from 10g to 11g database.
The so called Oracle consultants milked it during the whole process...
I was shown once how to use this fancy tool by Oracle called "Golden Gate", all it did was copy paste all data from one schema to another.
The best one though was when an Oracle DBA said the best way to do big queries was to create temp tables rather than do big joins.

I don't know if there is a psychological term or humans are just stupid.
However I was reading a historical book on Roman culture during the era of the republic.
You would have announcers, posters and graffiti that would be placed around the cities telling grandiose stories for the plebs.
Many of the stories were false however were gobbled up by the plebs.
Now I see the exact same behaviour on Reddit and elsewhere. 
We just love to gobble down anything without thinking twice.
