You could just ask them their opinion. I dont think you necessarily have to sell them.  Maybe its more of bitcoin awareness rather than "marketing".
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:14:28
Thanks for sharing your concerns and and your willingness to be convinced. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:13:20
I believe its unstoppable as well. But I just think that telling other people can only help. Forget the ones who think its a ponzi, there are a few who will go own to be investors, developers and the next andreas antonopolous. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:16:51
thats a great idea.  
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:22:59
Ok, so if your mom calls it bitcoin, then WE the bitcoin enthusiast need to switch to get in lockstep. 
Its almost reverse psychology. 
20,000 bitcoins = 5 satoshis

I do not have a store, but I have a lot of time and at starbucks in LA often. 
Can I just sell bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:56:18
I will. I've been in the same city my entire life and have gotten to know several business owners. 
Any links to a "how to" help owners set up, Im not the most technically savvy person but I think I could work fairly easily off a basic guide. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:25:44
Thanks for doing this Patrick!
What is your biggest "fear" for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:11:43
It is legal to write on your dollar bills. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:34:37
thats right, hopefully the wound will become infected
but its besides the point.

what i meant by poor was infrastructure. 
While the us is poor in one sense, I feel that there are lots of other nations who work hard, yet are still poor because they are sending their money and there are huge fees.  They would understand the value of bitcoin and use it more because it would actually save them money quickly, where as here in the US bitcoin still feels like a novelty.
@_date: 2014-09-29 04:08:28
The demand for bitcoins is not in the US.  The real demand is in developing countries. 
We need to reach the BILLIONS of people in growing but "poor" nations, and allow them to CONTROL their own MONEY. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:56:07
you mean debt?

Excellent. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:34:52
the difference is you've probably spent a fair amount of time building up your filters.
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:53:53
Ah I like this idea. 
Like hey if you end up using bitcoin for X months pay a consultant fee. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:24:11
youre correct, but all innovation relies on misfortune. 
uber grows when people have bad taxi experiences
autoteslas grow everytime there is a fatal car accident.

I am surprised by some of the numbers as well, then I look zoom out on the bitcoin charts and remember 
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:21:48
I think its important to be very aware of the fact that anyone can create an account, and help to create tension, naysay, disrupt, and help to polarize the community. Its important to have established leaders who are commited to bitcoin and the principles. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 00:12:55
I appreciate your comment. I can't give you gold, but I did just sign up for shift because of it.  Cheers bro
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:03:25
ah this is great. thanks
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:01:07
you have good picks, you just bought the top. 
the biggest mistake you can make is to sell at a loss. Ive learned this the hard way many times. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:14:01
No it needs to adapt over time. 
The time is right to switch to Mbits.  When bitcoin grows, there will be a time when it makes sense to switch to bits. 
Baby steps and giant leaps.

Great, I hope they ban it so that Bitcoin will transform into something better.

The code is mightier than the bank. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:24:59
I think an important insight is that there is no bitcoin CEO   
bitcoin is an open source &amp; decentralized project with out a board, ceo or corporate structure
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:34:57
Not disturbed. Private companies can do as the please. If they want to open source it when finished developing great.

I plan to hold long enough to where I stop thinking in terms of dollars. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:08:11
Excited for a bitcoin bump.  Go crypto!
@_date: 2017-05-04 06:59:57
what they think is secondary.... 
just mention it and go from there..... 
why not just ask them a question.  What is bitcoin.... play dumb and let them tell you what bitcoin is...... 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:04:12
THANKS!  Love bitcoin. Support the cause!

noobs can make their own decisions on wallet security
when you own enough you'll protect it

lol. got to find the sweet spot where they do then back off a little bit. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:54:52
Excellent!  A great example of how to tell people about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:03:47
Disagree. 
Advertising works. 
Bitcoin is going to do well regardless, but talking about it outside of your normal circles can only benefit its progression.
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:46:32
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:01:43
this is stupid.
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:12:32
wrong. count how many times you hear about money/dollars or see a dollar sign and compare it to mentions of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:28:30
it has a long way to go, but the adoption in technology is almost exponential compared to the late 70s

By that logic, a bike would be twice as fast as walking. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:55:32
which one do you think you're in?
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:52:16
telling people about bitcoin /= telling them to invest in bitcoin

it takes a village to pump a coin
@_date: 2019-05-06 11:02:19
The thing about governments though, is that they are made up of people. And we can build new systems that make the old ones obsolete.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:04:54
Tell MORE PEOPLE ABOUT BITCOIN!  The more we talk about it, the higher the price goes.

Good advice. I love that you started that community. I visited Colombia last year and loved it. Felt like it was a very progressive place with a good grip on technology. The subway system in medellin was pretty amazing to see.
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:41:15
I have a few thousand dollars and am wondering if there is such things as bitcoin "stops"(might be the wrong term) like in the stock market where if the price starts to drop it will sell. 
What are some other ways to invest in the bitcoin industry?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:45:25
um cuz thats how the world works.
if you have a car and want to go somewhere you have to leave it on someone else's property. 
We have a business and we keep all of our inventory on someone elses property.
