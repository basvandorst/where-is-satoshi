Interim Announcement
August 6, 2016
 
Following the theft on August 2nd, the Bitfinex team has been working tirelessly towards bringing the platform back online in a secure and controlled manner. We have finalized the accounting of losses incurred and are currently coordinating strategic plans for compensating customers.
 
We intend to come online within 24-48 hours with limited platform functionality. Additional announcements will be made as we progressively enable more platform features and return to full operations. We appreciate that our customers and the public want this handled quickly, but it needs to be done a way in which all assets are secure and immune from vulnerabilities. Every resource is being leveraged to make that happen in a safe and optimal way.
 
As disclosed in earlier announcements, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers have been cancelled and all financed positions have been settled. Exact settlement prices were published on August 3rd.
 
After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses.
 
We are actively discussing various strategic options with numerous potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. Such discussions, however, are in early stages and will likely take time to play out. In the meantime, In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customer’s discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged—upon the creditor’s request and Bitfinex’s acceptance—for shares of iFinex Inc. We are still sorting out many details on this; we will post further updates in the coming days.
 
Thank you for your continued patience and for the many generous offers of support that we have received over the last several days. Notwithstanding this attack, we continue to believe in the possibilities associated with bitcoin. We will continue to update our customers and the public as and when we can.

They still accept bitcoin... I ordered something yesterday from them with Bitcoin's... 
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:57:26
Nope. No verification for me as it was all in chunks under the daily limits.  Any name.  Any address. Pay the wallet and get some goodies :)

Silvergoldbull   used them for lots of bullion/Bitcoin purchases

Nice. Here is my setup to keep things warm. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:57:10
Nothing new lately. The admin hasn't said anything for over a month now. 
Everyone is in the dark it seems.
 
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:46:55
Current price - purchase price = profit
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:54:57
Probably Too low of a fee.  Just gotta wait it out
I normally do 0.001 these days.  
Vote for segwit! 
 &gt;I went to transfer coins from my Bitcoin wallet to another address 4 days ago and it's still stuck on 0 confirmation. The transaction fee was set to high (0.0002). I don't know a lot about bitcoins as I'm new to it but can any offer some advice if there is a way to get it to confirm?
@_date: 2016-02-27 17:15:18
Can't even buy Pixels with Bitcoin?  REALLY?!
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:39:32
If you withdrawal now I will get more of my coins back on the 15th :) 
@_date: 2016-09-04 03:25:46
The Pirate Bay - then donate in Bitcoin to their address :)

Hi Ivan, my name is Fontas, and I will Pump and Dump you!
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:22:32
Cool story bro.. Now the real reason is because  said its going down :)
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:26:13


I don't think that's really something anyone would answer or has to answer.  Its none of your business how many he has :P  You don't go around on the street asking people how much money they have in their wallet just because they bought something at a store do you?
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:37:50
You're fucked dude
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:53:03
We don't even know who controls the coins yet.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:16:53
They all find it too risky. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:54:01
Not the .NZ domain (yet)
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:41:59
I am in the same situation hoping!  I had roughly the same total in LTC waiting for a similar market move...
sigh.. my risk / my fault for having them on an exchange, but then again I have used BTC-e for years so it didn't seem like a problem.  
Thank you USA for being the world bullies you are.  I gave you a grand old FUCK YOU.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:10:12
and they are all gone now.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:36:25

Isn't that the coinbase cold storage wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:03:26
Nothing new yet
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:55:34
And no, this is not my ad!
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:14:45
not likely.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:38:17
The quick answer is depends on the location you try to do it.   Most places won't touch that level all at once however 30-50 at a time hasn't been a problem for me and can do the same every few days.  Lots of money flowing right now makes it easy 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:43:00
Did that this week!
