I have always been very skeptical of large charities, as much of funds are poorly allocated and often end up in the wrong hands, be it salaries or mismanagement. Though now I believe to have found a charity worth donating to. 
Sharetanzania is a small but effective charity operating in, you've guessed it, Tanzania. Here they take in children of the streets, handicapped children and their mothers, and even stray dogs. John, the founder and person in charge, believes all life is worth saving - a truly beautiful vision, uncorrupted (as far as my research and intuition tells me)
John, besides actively running a charity, also has a YouTube channel where he often posts videos about the charity, but more often than not he talks about subjects related to philosophy, esotericism, mysticism and metaphysics. Even though i highly encourage people to read into or get involved in such topics, I know it's not for everyone. I find it truly encouraging to see John spend as much time as he does on the charity but still find the time to share his thoughts and ideas on the internet, I personally have found much wisdom, knowledge and faith by aid of his videos (After nearly 20 years of atheism I recently found God through much reading, listening and inward thought)
To get a more detailed picture of the charity I suggest to check out their website:  
If you're interested in the topics mentioned above or just want to get a sense of things on the ground or about John, I suggest to watch some of his videos:  (note: if any of you feel cringe for people talking about Jesus or God as I did, try to see past that - the Bible is merely allegorical after all.)
