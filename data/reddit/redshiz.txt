Next quote that Huff forgot to mention:

To get you started, the Huff Post quotes the article:


but fails to quote the follow up statement in the PDF:

Lol my typo, I meant *shouldn't* have to watch ads.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:40:22


Too bad they don't accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:58:19
Can this be positive?  If you can't trade BTC/CNY wouldn't China be pressured to do MORE BTC-BTC transactions?  PBOC could be shooting themselves in the foot with this action?

Oh, don't forget the author is Entrepreneur In Residence (EIR) at [Foundation Capital]( which is potentially (maybe not a strong enough word) threatened by the blockchain.  So the blog is self-serving.
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:16:20
It was posted for ironic/comedic value.  I obviously have no career in writing.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:51:11
It needs to be a win/win/win.  Content creators should get more revenue, Google's cut is larger than the advertising revenue, and the customer/viewer ~~should~~ *should not* have to watch ads.
Edit: forgot an important word.

Just in case the Huffington post removes the link to the BoC article, I've [included it here](
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:32:49
Reading through this and [part two]( I don't think the author really understands the technology.  Article should be titled "My Understanding of the Blockchain is Bullshit".

A Google search for "Bitcoin escrow" (or altcoin of your choice) shows some alternative solutions for 'important transactions'.

Filing the patent doesn't mean they would build it.  And alternative scenario is to prevent other people from creating the technology without having to pay licensing fees to BOA.  iE patent trolling

I made similar comments when KFC Canada did their bitcoin bucket.  In the end I could not buy the bucket without paying a $40 transaction fee.

You are misquoting the article.  The article suggests that the blockchain is of interest to VISA:

An ostrich, you say?

As an example let's say the block reward splits in half, and half the mining community decides to stop.  For those remaining, the difficulty will decrease and make their mining equipment more profitable.  It's self balancing.
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:09:08
I see your point.  Which brings up some questions I can't answer, hoping others could chime in.
For larger transactions, does it make sense to wait for more confirmations before considering a transaction "complete"? (Ex Selling a house for BTC, you wait a few extra days to sign the deed over)
Does having 51% of the hashing power guarantee success?  And does waiting additional confirmations on large transactions increase the % hashing power required to be successful attacking the block chain?

Absolutely recommend getting one to learn how they work.  Websites/videos don't do it justice until you've played with one hands on.  That's what she said.

Can you reference the article where the CEO of JPMorgan says Bitcoin is fraud?
EDIT: Nevermind, I found it:
EDIT: Reading THAT article I can quote the CEO of JPMORGAN saying "Don’t ask me to short (Bitcoin). It could be at $20,000" LOL

I tried using bitpay to order KFC a few years back.  What a disaster.  Would not work with any of my wallets.
I think Steam was also using bitpay?  They threw the baby (crypto) out with the bathwater (bitpay).
I agree with your sentiment.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:54:22
We would need to be less worried about crypto and more worried about privacy.

How is a BitCoin payment "declined?"  If the person that donated used BitCoin, didnt it HAVE to be received by BitPay?  Can they decline a large transaction to a bitcoin address?  Something sounds fishy here...

This should be a Has anyone considered that "Satoshi" had registered the domain bitcoin.org before releasing it to the public?  Would the Whois have some information that can be traced to a person?  If not leading to Satoshi, it would most likely lead to someone with knowledge.

How long between the BMO deposit and seeing it in your VoS account?
