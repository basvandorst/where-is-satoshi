What tipped you off? All the references to the IRS?

It refers to which side is more motivated. Yes, for every buy there is a sell. However, if the standing bids are getting hit, it's selling action and the price goes down. If the standing offers are getting hit, it's buying action and the price goes up.

Clearly you haven't been paying attention. They communicate? LOL. They post on reddit or their blog days after making a major change. Customer service is hit or miss. You might get a reply to your email, you might not. Top notch? Hardly. And the fees are the highest of anyone in the business. They are only keeping customers because they have no competition in the States.

Yep, this sucks. I guess this is one instance where the 50 BTC limit is nice. You at least have 24 hours before more can be purchased. I realize that doesn't make the $6500 loss any less painful...
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:22:25
The emails saying the BTC you purchased are now available often arrive after the actual BTC is in your account. So did you buy the 50 BTC? Is it possible that someone has access to a PC that you logged in to coinbase with earlier?

Coinbase doesn't store users' fiat, only BTC. If you sell on coinbase, fiat gets directly deposited to your bank account. There is no such thing as CoinbaseUSD.
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:20:37
The .0001 BTC is the mining fee. They get paid to process the transactions...pretty standard whenever a transfer is made between addresses. 
Unfortunately, I would guess that you will be held liable for this. I don't think coinbase will eat the loss. Though if your bank account can't post the money I'm not sure what happens. Keep us updated.
You've made me more paranoid now. This is a direction of attack that I hadn't thought of. I moved most of my coinbase holdings onto paper wallets, but I am still vulnerable to this type of attack.
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:40:56
Yep, you've uncovered a very serious potential flaw in the coinbase model. They've made it very easy for people in the US to get into bitcoin, but perhaps the security levels aren't ready for general public consumption. 
The fact that there is no phone number to call is alarming as well. Any company that has the potential to charge you $6,500 (and rising) instantly ought to have someone available on the phone to at least explain what has happened and take the appropriate measures to end the compromise.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:56:17
Absolutely not.

So your excuse is, "we were asleep"? 
You guys are running one of the major businesses in a 24/7 market and you don't have at least one person working evenings?. Do you take weekends off too?

If .01 BTC is "all" of your money, perhaps you shouldn't be visiting gambling sites in the first place.

It's going to be a lot harder to convince her after you lose thousands trying to mine. Seriously read up on mining difficulty and projected (lack of) ROI. Don't do it!
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:18:33
It is relevant if you actually want to use it as a currency. If a loaf of bread costs .02 BTC today and .04 or .01 tomorrow, it's not a very usable currency to most people. Unless everyone instantly converts BTC back to their local currency after every transaction its merits as a payment system are risky until it stabilizes.

That will be its symbol if it gets recognized as an official currency. All currencies that aren't backed by a government start with X, like XAU for gold.

What's the issue with coinbase? It's working great for me, but I've only been on it for a few weeks. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:00:54
Holy shit.
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:44:39
I have many paper wallets that have only one deposit and won't be touched for years. I really don't want to try to cash out eventually and find out my coins are gone due to inactivity. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:17:27
My sales have been showing up next day in my bank account. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 10:04:26
Ah, gotcha. Agreed. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:43:14
Now that I think about it the limit starts accruing instantly doesn't it? So in theory you can start purchasing again at a rate of 0.48BTC/hour. So yeah...definitely de-link your account ASAP.

You'll probably do better with some links to FIRST and a link to your team's website. Most people don't know what the hell you're talking about.

How do you know he hasn't already cashed out for millions? If it fails now, he could still make a crap ton of money off of it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:12:34
They make 1% on every transaction. I believe that is their business model. They should also have a 10 point spread to make money on?
@_date: 2013-08-30 19:10:23
It's not necessarily people looking to get out of bitcoin...they are trying to get out of mt. gox and the only way is to buy bitcoin there and move it out.
@_date: 2013-08-31 01:43:26
You just tipped him $5 million in 2025 "dollars". 
@_date: 2013-08-28 00:50:18
Wow, that came off as a totally normal discussion, not completely scripted. Though I couldn't really understand what the guy was talking about. Perhaps if he used his hands more...
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:07:23
Yep, the responses are "oh, drugs", or "too risky", or "might collapse". And these are from generally tech-oriented people. 
This tells me that we are definitely still early adopter stage. Most "techy" people aren't on board yet...nevermind the average Joe.
When the general public starts to figure this out...watch out. Buy now and buy big. :)
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:21:22
Yes, thousands of people have thought of this. The sole reason the mtgox markup exists is because it is incredibly difficult to get your fiat out of there. If it were at all easy, or there were any "loopholes", they would be exploited quickly and you would have a flood of BTC sellers on mtgox and the price would come back inline with the solvent exchanges.
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:25:43
You need to de-link your bank account immediately if you haven't already done so. Otherwise if your account is compromised, someone could keep buying and transferring out BTC repeatedly. I don't believe coinbase has a method of checking your account balance before initiating the purchase.

You realize the super bowl is watched by more people in the WORLD than any other event, right?
