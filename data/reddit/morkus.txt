I'm currently mining for slush's pool with a BFL Jalapeno. Should I bother mining on P2Pool?

wow. very currency. so amaze.

This is essentially correct. To try to make it a bit simpler, it's like this:
Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and Alice wants Bob to be certain the message is from Alice.
Alice writes her message and signs it, using her private key to lock up the signature. 
Bob gets the message from Alice and sees it is signed; he tries to unlock the signature using Alice's public key. 
As long as that works, the message must be from Alice, since she's the only one who  can lock things up with her private key!

Alright, I'm going to post this since I just figured it all out.
**Short Term: Get an online wallet at [blockchain.info](
1. Sign up for a new wallet. Pick a [secure password](
2. In the Account Settings, enter your mobile number and verify it.
3. Go down to the "Security" section of Account Settings and enable two-factor authentication (or Google Authenticator, or whatever you want to use). 
4. Click "Passwords" and go through the steps to set a second password on your wallet. This password will be required before any BTC can be sent.
5. Note your password mnemonics. Print them out or store them someplace secure.
6. Hooray! You've created a reasonably secure online wallet.
**Long Term: Produce an [offline-generated paper wallet](
1. Go to [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( and follow the super-paranoid instructions.
2. Download the zip from github
3. Unplug your computer from the internet
4. Produce your paper wallet
5. Print your paper wallet on a local, trustworthy printer
6. Squirrel that paper wallet away someplace secure, like a safe or a bank
7. Keep the public key easily accessible. You can use that to check the value and periodically deposit funds.
8. When you redeem that paper wallet, redeem ALL of it. Treat it like a piggy bank. It is printed to be easily redeemable at Mt. Gox or blockchain.info.
Since this seems to be the popular thing, I'll just leave this here for tips... 1MurmApwH1nT4eNLLoJmrLzGYcB3bszmFE

Since you seem to have a fundamental grasp of what's going on, let me link you to [my comment below]( in the hopes of getting an answer.

Of course! But threats will always exist, and something is *never* automatically trustworthy (or not trustworthy), regardless of whether it's open-source or closed-source. 
My whole argument was to counter the inference you made with your statement:


That statement infers:


Again, open-source is not a magical solution to the issue of trusting your computing environment. How much do you rely on the wisdom of the masses (I certainly do) to tell you that the code you're running is safe? Have you inspected every line of the linux distribution you use? Every line of the GNU toolkit? 
There are so, so, many ways for your environment to be poisoned; we essentially take it on faith that it isn't, whether the source is open or closed.

So could someone throw together a decent guide for (a) short-term and (b) long-term storage of a bitcoin wallet? 
I have a wallet sitting in my encrypted homedir of a linux machine at work in an environment I would otherwise consider very secure. Now I'm questioning that but I'm not exactly sure what I should be doing.

You are once again not seeing the forest for the trees. 
The hack used by Ken Thompson was *an example*; the point he was making about trusting your computing environment is where you should be paying attention!
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:05:51
I just switched from multi-bit, a local linux client, to blockchain. What makes blockchain a trustworthy source? Couldn't they in theory be running keyloggers?
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:14:24
Three words: statute of limitations.
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:47:24
Um, [citation needed]? 
Are you seriously suggesting that philosophy about trust of computing environments has been somehow "debunked?"
 Suggestions about using different compilers may defeat the specific example Ken Thompson uses, but you're missing the point: unless you're pressing your own silicon and soldering your own circuits, you *can't* be 100% certain about your computing environment. 
The wider argument here is that you have to cede trust at some point or another, because unless you *are* building your own computing environment from scratch, *you can't even trust code you wrote and compiled yourself!*
All of this adds up to the fact that open-source is no more inherently trustworthy than closed-source. You're just trusting something else. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 18:13:49
No, the people on StackOverflow are looking for ways to defeat the specific hack Thompson used, which sounds like a fun exercise.
Again, Thompson was making a wider remark about trusting your computing environment. Why do you think the [US government is banning the import of Chinese-made computing equipment]( for their own equipment? It's because they know they can't trust the computing environment without evaluating every single piece of silicon - too much work!
As you quoted already:


The point isn't that your compiler could be compromised. The point is that smart people can produce threats which are essentially impossible to detect - *even when you're looking for it* - and that open-source isn't some magical solution to this problem. 
Don't conflate the defeat of the example Thompson used with the idea that his overarching point was in turn defeated. They're not the same thing!
@_date: 2013-10-14 12:54:47
[The Ken Thompson hack]( effectively proves that you *can't* "know what the fuck you're running on your computer," irrespective of closed or open source. 
If you're "trusting" open-source because it's open-source, you're doing it wrong.

THIS. I have no more love for BFL than anybody else, but we can't have our cake and eat it, too.
Imagine this scenario: we convince a merchant who sells widgets in USD to start accepting BTC as well. After thirty days, we decide we no longer want the widget. Coincidentally, the price of BTC relative to USD has gone way, way up. We cannot expect the merchant to refund in BTC; he sells his wares in USD and only accepts BTC as a courtesy through a service like Bitpay.
It's basically the exact same scenario with BFL, except they are massive assholes.

Can anybody summarily explain a list of products BFL has to ship?
From what I've read in their forums, the entire product lineup (or some of it?) changed sometime after the beginning of 2013. So now they have all of the old products to ship, as well as the new products? 
Some are called Jalapenos, some are called Singles, some are called Little Singles, some are called Minirigs ... I have a difficult time determining exactly what OP's title (or the forum content it links to) really means.
