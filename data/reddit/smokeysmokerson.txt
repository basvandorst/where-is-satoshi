not aware of anything called a golden goose broseph..  but a death cross is very specific and no you cant just draw any line anywhere and call it anything..
if you think a death cross has no meaning,  i'm sorry but you're an idiot :)  does it mean that 100% of the time something is going to die?  no,  and nothing does,  but does it mean about 80-90% of the time that the following cycle is going to have a real bad time.. yeah..  like almost every freakin time..  so educate yourself.
actually you picked one of the worst bits of TA to debunk.. its really simple math..  death cross means that 50 MA crossed below the 200 MA..   its about as simple as math can get,  and any idiot can tell thats a big deal.

The idea is to build a network capable of supporting far more transactions than we currently have.  If bitcoin were to process as many transactions as the big card companies, the cost per transaction would be nothing.  Take your $1297 number and divide by 30 000 transactions instead for example.  You're at $.043.  
Seeding the initial blocks, does two things, gets people interested in the concept due to the potential to mine coins, but more importantly it builds a network to support a system as big as visa / mastercard / amex / discover all combined.  Building a network big enough to support the future transactions is the key part here,  the cost per transaction now is irrelevant, and your math doesn't even work out because it doesn't take into the account the money people are re-couping from the efforts..

the earnings are in btc,  what do you not understand?  the stock earns in btc, and is priced in btc,  the earnings have everything to do with the price of the stock in btc,  but almost nothing to do with the price of the stock in usd,  the price of the stock in usd is mostly irrelevant.

Not so much the case with asicminer,  they earn in btc,  the exchange rate has little to do with their operations other than the cost of electricity, employees, and materials..   (and all these costs actually go DOWN, if bitcoin goes up)

if their earnings had anything to do with fiat i might agree, but read what i said their earnings are in btc, therefore their valuation to earnings ratio is not effected by exchange rate (or more accurately, very minimally)
