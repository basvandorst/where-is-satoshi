And your point? It is more true today than five months ago.

All I can say is Wow!
A few months ago, one of their newsletters said that they were going to start enforcing their "inactive account" policy. I can't believe they made it retroactive. I'm stunned.

Just like everything else, these days... Not a good thing.

It's as if you've been reading my notebook for the last couple of days... I've been saying the same thing about all three things... Getting rid of mining pools &amp; ASICs, and making solo mining profitable again... Cheers!

I'm glad CaVirtEx is back!

Wow! Two years ago, the hash rate was 600,000 GH/s. That means it has increased by a factor of 678.

I was always very happy with CAVIRTEX. I felt that the higher fees were worth it to maintain good relationships with the banks (which they did).
   About a month ago, I stopped an attempted withdrawal from my bank account to CAVIRTEX. At the time, their technical support claimed there had been about 30 similar incidents in the previous few weeks. My only complaint is that the bank would not refund the NSF fee, even though it was from an attempted robbery.
---&gt;&gt; THE CORPORATE TAKEOVER OF BITCOIN IS COMPLETE &lt;&lt;---
This is simply even more evidence.

They're planning on holding a new election, I believe...

For whatever it's worth, the IP address 94.142.155.55 appears to be in Iceland...

The HashFast Miner Protection Program is tough to beat. I'm planning on ordering soon.

I just checked--it's up &amp; running. No problemo.
