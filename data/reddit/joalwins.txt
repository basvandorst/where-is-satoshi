Just check the Main Page Twitter Feed of that Account. It's clearly been bought by Ver and is full of Anti-BTC tweets &amp; BCH propaganda. Use the Report  function and report that account, multiple times.

Same thing that would happen to their Credit Card, Debit Card, Paypal, Cash App &amp; Internet banking transactions.

We really need more and more adoption like this. Cheers to you bud! I'm going to use your services soon.

Report that account for scamming and get it banned.

Edge or Bluewallet - Both have Segwit

Thank you!

See you at ATH in Jan 2019.

Impersonation. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:15:32
Doesn’t matter what you think I did. I’m a richer man than I was years ago. Thanks to bitcoin. But sure, continue your hate. ������

Lmao. Who said anything about holding? I sold everything at 18k. Kept the Fiat. Then bought 4x more Bitcoin yesterday with the same amount. So Mr. imbecile, don’t blame bitcoin for your stupidity. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:22:28
+505.90% up since 2016. +1,276% up since 3 years. +191,305% up since last 7 years. Yeah, backward. By all means, sell your Bitcoins. I'll buy! :D
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:23:51
4700 now. Here we go. ^
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:36:22
* BRD is complete Trash.
* The old Breadwallet was Awesome!
Go for other wallets which Already support Segwit:
* Edge (iOS/Android)
* Bluewallet
* GreenAddress etc.

If only I had a Time Machine. :(

Those people who put their life savings and retirement funds into a volatile currency are plain stupid. First rule of investing: Invest only that much which you can afford to lose. They wanted to get rich quick. So they got rekt hard. Plain and simple. If you believe in bitcoin, invest 20% of your savings into it and sit back and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:29:45
Lol the FUD is high.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:34:09
Yes you can!
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:37:26
Nice way to farm karma. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:00:21
Report this for trolling. We don't need more FUD here.
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:13:07
Nah man. I like to live dangerously. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:12:52
Lmao. Looking at your Reddit comment history seems like you’re dealing with Anxiety issues. Well if you keep up this stupidity, it will continue increasing. ������
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:08:59
Lol someone bought high and sold low it seems. The recent price decline has probably impaired your brain and you brought tinkerbell into it too. Lol. Did you even read what I wrote properly. I love bitcoin. But I’m not here to “get rich quick” like you are. And then whine when the price goes down. I believe in a decentralised currency. That’s why I’m invested in bitcoin. And yes, I won’t put all my life savings in it. Because I’m not stupid.

The website doesn't work, gives a malware/not secure warning. That's bad publicity of Bitcoin mate. Atleast vet your sources before linking them here. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:45:38
There's no point in selling after hodling so long. Bitcoin is sure as f*ck NOT going to Zero. There are whales out there waiting for this opportunity to buy from weak hands.
Sure if you sell, two things will happen:
It may go down lower &amp; you can buy more for the same price.
It may go much higher &amp; then you'll buy high &amp; hodl even less than what you have, thus losing Bitcoins in the process.
Look at the charts, It's always gone up and up everytime it was down this much. Is it really worth the risk to sell your Bitcoins so low? It's not for me. I am HODLING!
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:26:42
Sure. Take it that way then. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:04:30
I'll be there to buy all your total 0.00001 BTC hodlings if it goes down to $400. See you then mate. :D
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:14:07
Just saying that Lightning network isn't really appealing unless it goes to mainstream users.
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:33:13
Okay. You gave me a chance? Lol. Sure.

May I have some Digital Gold sir?
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:34:24
I'm fucking spending BTC &amp; then buying quickly to fill it again.
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:27:50
That’s not even my username though lol. I just found that site and posted it. Not sure why the trashy attitude. Are you sure you aren’t from r/btc?
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:58:13
Exactly. The common people will see it as a Malware warning genius. Stop promoting your channel for views. kthxbye!
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:51:34
And no one literally gives a shit right now. Everyone busy looking at the price.
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:22:24
That's not my referral link, it's a tipping site, you can make your own. Also stop trolling.
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:40:41
Atleast I’m not promoting my YouTube channel with old expired videos, like you were a while ago. ��
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:43:04
Lol you should know that, it’s in your post history. Anyway gonna stop replying to you. Bye!
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:41:00
This will be really helpful for the crypto community! Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:27:13
Doesn't work. Stop trying to get Views for your channel.
