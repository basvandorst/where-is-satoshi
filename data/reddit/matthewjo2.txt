 October, 31 is a date of Bitcoin whitepaper release, and some people consider it as a birth of bitcoin. It is a nice idea to make such candies dedicated to Halloween. Or make Bitcoin-themed costumes. People are excited about such things.

 We know that miners go all out on selecting nice short hashes. So, why can’t we look for optimized settings of compress algorithm instead? What about turning blockchain to something similar to a torrent-file? Let’s assume that the network has a million users. In such case to store for instance one hundredth on each disk, every part of blockchain will be replicated on the average in 10 thousand copies. I think that such number can guarantee security. The system will be needed to monitor the number of available copies of every part and automatically equalize the diffusion. It’s just my humble opinion.

 All these currencies served as the base for Bitcoin. In fact, Digicash, as the first currency based on cryptography, inspired a further development of digital money. All cryptocurrencies created before Bitcoin had failed because they didn’t receive enough popularity or suffered from a technical debt, but their contribution can’t be overestimated.

 Coin Stats provides news from more than forty sources which is quite convenient. Plus, you can track the prices of more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies and monitor analytical data of the market. Also, I use Twitter as a network with the most relevant information.
