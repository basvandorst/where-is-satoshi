Sorry, I have to correct you. Playing video games does make you smarter. Strategy based games train players in problem solving at a very high level. WoW isn't as strategic as RTS games, but the thinking required to do a raid is far above what non-players can process. In addition the size and depth of a single game's lexicon rivals that of a medical textbook. In other words, a gamer has to learn and process a vast corpus of new information in a strategic way to solve problems in realtime. There's books written about how the generations that grew up with these strategy-based games are better prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.
Of course, that doesn't prevent gamers from being ignorant.

It doesn't matter. There's no noticeable difference to MtGox having insufficient funds and MtGox limiting withdraws for arbitrary reasons. The only observable result is limited withdraws. The reason (from your perspective) is completely arbitrary. It could be because of gremlins! The reasons are not relevant since knowing the reason doesn't change your options: you still have to deal with limited withdraws. You'll never know if a private company is about to go under from the outside unless you trust the public info being communicated to you (which in this case says they have funds). Maybe tomorrow this all changes, but for now this is all we know and it's all that matters.

If you're a business with thousands of drones, you want the cheapest operators to ensure the safe and successful completion of each drone's task. If you're a dad, you want your toy drone to safely play with you and your daughter (ie so you don't need to be behind the controls). Consensus algorithms have a long history in avionics and mission critical systems (ie multiple redundant programs must agree otherwise there's been an error in at least one of them). So this isn't new.
Military could also implement distributed drone operators to reduce PTS and reduce ethical mistakes, though that wouldn't need markets or bitcoin, so might be offtopic here.

Wild theory: Dorian was contacted to design a cryptocurrency in 2008, and then handed it off when his part was done.

This requires gambling on what constitutes a crash and what constitutes a recovery. Unfortunately you can't tell if the price is crashing until it's too late to make any serious profit. And you can't tell if the price is recovering until it's too late to make any serious profit either. Anyone who does manage profits are mostly lucky that they sold before the crash and then bought at the bottom (although being experienced also helps quite a bit). 
Bitcoin is already risky enough, you don't need to compound that risk with more gambles by trying to catch a falling knife or jumping back on a moving train. Reddit is full of people who lost money trying to time their bids/asks. We're all gambling enough as it is. 
(btw, I've bought at the peaks of the last two bubbles, and I don't regret it. I wish I could have sold before the crashes, but I know that if I had TRIED to time the top I would have sold too soon (ie I wanted to sell at $300 but held. and then for sure at $450 I thought it was the peak and I should sell, but I held. and I would certainly have sold at $750 because there was no way it could go to $1000! But I held. It could have gone to $1500 or $2000 before crashing, we don't know (although the double top was a good sign, but it wasn't guaranteed). So I'm glad, because all my sell targets would not have made me as much money as just not selling at all. So yeah, I'm okay with having bought all the way up, and then held.)

You have an unstated premise that notXT will have the intended outcome it desires. Game theory can be quite unintuitive: notXT can easily cause a tipping point where undecided miners shift to XT due to the assumption that it has reached a critical mass, which then actually gives it the necessary critical mass it didn't have before notXT. It's more likely that notXT will backfire than that it will actually work. Basically, in order for it to work, Core would have to mine faster (ie achieve the longest chain) after the 2-week grace period, which requires that there be 50%+1 of miners who don't want XT, and if this is the case, then it's equivalent to simply staying with Core (ie voting the normal way). It's a bit sad, because if there is 51% miners who feel this way, then they could easily vote against XT without causing so much drama.

Also, see *Conjectures and Refutations* by Karl Popper (which, along with Popper's earlier work, is the inspiration for Deutsch's book).
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:05:48
You're not wrong, but you're also not considering the 2-week grace period, and the fixed date before which no fork can occur. While neither the grace period nor the fixed date are optimal safe guards, they are sufficient to avoid chaos. The possibility for a smooth transition exists, it's merely that such a scenario isn't guaranteed. Understanding this easily explains why some people are worried while others are not.

Wow neither of those links makes any formal argument against raising the limit due to a security risk. Your main problem right now is that both the risks of centralization and the concerns over minimizing minimum fees are entirely speculative (at least as presented in those links). They lack clear premises and a valid argument structure. And so it's unsurprising that they have failed to be convincing.
Since an open source project relies on multiple generations of developers (ie, the current devs will not be the only devs for all time), I believe it's fair to expect some dissemination of valid (and sound) arguments against the BIP101 proposal (rather than unorganized and informal objections). If these arguments exist (as I'm sure they do), then now might be a great time to publish/promote them!

There have (and always will be) people trying to attack bitcoin for fun, profit and spite. This changes nothing. If a minority of miners protest, they will only hurt themselves. If a majority of miners protest, then it isn't a protest, it's a majority vote.

You two are talking over each other. mrmishmashmix is referring to the game theoretic consequences, which are social in nature (ie they involve humans making decisions) and pb1x is referring to the technical consequences, which are algorithmic in nature (ie they involve deterministic invariants that don't change). So you're both right within these respective context-domains, yet your arguments are considered category mistakes within your opponent's context-domain.
To fix this thread, I would recomment pb1x switch to a social context-domain, in which case the conception of 'dominance' is game theoretic rather than algorithmic. Or just carry on as if we're shouting on the Internet.

Indeed, but then you're playing a language-game, parsing semantics rather than solving a problem.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:05:43
No one replied to you, so I should mention that:
1) This paper explicitly says it's only a partial model. It's strictly insufficient to extrapolate a sound premise from this paper alone. Though I did enjoy the clarity of its argument. Unfortunately the concerns it raises (even if they are only partially accurate) are strictly irrelevant for many more years. Thus, it's doubly irrelevant to the current debate (though it is of interest for long term planning).
2) This is an important paper, but it's not strictly relevant to the blocksize debate. Mining pools were conceived and have been growing for many reasons, and a larger block size was not one of them.
3) This is misleading, and you should know better! If you read the rest of the email thread, you'll get to: 
Basically: "[...] This further confirms the real problem, which doesn't have much to do with blocksize but rather the connectivity of nodes in countries with not-so-friendly internet policies and deceptive connectivity."
4) Taek's explanation is also refuted because it models the problem without including real-world connectivity.
In summary, the reasons for delaying BIP101 (or something like it) are based on gut feelings and bad models. In order for the debate to be less biased towards XT, there needs to be more complete models and better articulated arguments.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:05:12
Yes, miners have limited power. But in context of the XT drama, the critical information is the number of blocks created. XT, even after it triggers, will not produce a hard fork unless the Core miners fail to produce a longer chain. So while you're certainly correct that it's the full nodes that decide what blocks are valid, the first round of voting occurs with the miners. The full nodes then will only see invalid blocks if the miners have voted for XT. Hence my comment above. If it should come to that (ie with a majority of miners implementing XT), then it's just a matter of time until a large block is created, at which point the bitcoin network will split into two, and then (and only then) full nodes running Core will start rejecting the larger blocks. At that point, the real question is which network survives and for how long.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:52:01
Sorry, I missed that paper.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:47:28
For context, I believe the reason is discussing mining centralization is because it's considered an argument against raising the blocksize at this time (or any time such that propagation delays may produce a slight advantage to larger mining clusters). See 
Whether or not these arguments are sound is up for debate (see, for instance, 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:56:07
Publicly admitting to using notXT is the same as simply using Core: it results in the same information being publicly available. During the 2wk period, miners can tally the public information (which includes miners who admit to using notXT) to decide which side is likely to produce the longest chain. If some miners chose to protest by deliberately mining the shortest chain, then they only hurt themselves.
Edit: for clarity, talk about 'longest chains' refers to the scenario where regular small blocks are mined on Core after XT activates, which delays a fork (because XT will use this chain even if a large block exists somewhere on a shorter chain). But if the miners with XT produce a large block on a chain that's longer than Core, then the fork happens, and protest-miners still using Core are then clearly in the minority.
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:44:59

@_date: 2015-08-20 22:20:57
You are indeed being clear, and the links are indeed important. But perhaps where people are left unconvinced is on what constitutes a "large" block, since it's rather relative to the availability/cost of connectivity. This alone is a much more interesting (and empirical) debate to be having.
Also, your argument is:
(1) Centralization is bad.
(2) Latency encourages centralization.
(3) Insufficient connectivity causes latency.
(4) Sufficiently large blocks require sufficient connectivity.
(5) Eventually there will be insufficient connectivity for BIP101 blocks.
(6) Therefore, we should not adopt BIP101 (aka XT)
Now each premise is clearly visible, and people can discuss it properly. If all the premises are true, then your argument is sound and XT should be resisted.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:34:36
Meni, nobody here is being coerced into talking about or using any other implementation of Bitcoin. You've just written an article that claims that there is no gun to anyone's head. If people are convinced by anything, they do so by their own volition, and that is adamantly not a dictatorship. The only thing you can possibly call 'authoritarian' is the governance of the Github project, which you have just now agreed is precisely NOT the same as the Bitcoin project itself.

If you've seen a formal argument somewhere, please do share (or even just paraphrase it!).

I think you need to ask yourself what you mean by "consensus". Is it the unanimous agreement of a half dozen core devs? Because if that's what you mean, you have to realize that bitcoin is an open source project, and these devs, as brilliant as they are, do not own the bitcoin project (otherwise they would be at risk of extortion and pressure from sovereigns and powerful parties).
So, what did you think consensus meant in regard to building bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:26:24
Whoever keeps mining the shorter chain after a hard fork is going to have serious security issues and will likely be mining an economically dead blockchain. The shorter chain is orphaned and irrelevant, even if it was once considered Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:44:13
This is incorrect. You can't trigger the FORK prematurely, you can only trigger the CODE. The 75% is a trigger for the code itself, but the fork can only happen if enough hashing power is available to maintain a longer chain (and this isn't possible if miners lied). Thus, if you triggered the code without miner support, no fork is likely to occur and life goes on as if the lying miners had openly supported Core.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:26:53
This isn't quite true. People make this comparison because they see how easy it is for a consumer to switch from MySpace to Facebook, or Hotmail to Gmail and you see how easy it is to trade between Bitcoin and Litecoin. But the comparison ends there. With web services, it's only the consumer that has to switch. But with a currency, it's the entire ecosystem. A better comparison is with iOS vs Android vs etc.. As we've seen, the ecosystem is everything. People won't switch unless the ecosystem ALREADY exists (just ask Microsoft). So it's possible for an altcoin to overtake BTC, but it won't happen overnight, and it won't happen without massive effort from a lot of dedicated companies and groups. (ie consider the investment and development effort that went into making Android dominant in marketshare over iOS.. that's the kind of herculean effort that will be needed to displace the network effect of Bitcoin).

I didn't say it must, only that it's better to treat it as such. I believe that after the adoption of consumer encryption, it became a mandate for the NSA to find ways to circumvent it. So it became their job to find a backdoor and have it widely adopted. Perhaps it's mathematically impossible, but perhaps not. Since I'm not in a position to know (nor is most anybody on the internet), then I default to my stance as an optimist and believe that they fulfilled their mandate. Whether or not the NSA is being ethical is a debate that's independent of whether or not the NSA had incentive and whether or not it's even possible (these last two are only of consequence if the NSA had incentive to go down this road, and that's why I focus on that part of the argument). Since the NSA did have incentive, and the seed value could contain attributes that allow an exploit (assuming an exploit is possible), and since the leaks corroborate these two points, then the safe thing to do is believe that 256r1 is compromised and act accordingly.

Regardless of what currency you buy your toilet paper with, you're still spending $5. The author assumes that the minute you convert your USD into BTC that you'll no longer need to buy toilet paper. The error is in thinking that the money people use to pay for expenses is the same money they use for investing. It's not.

Good food for thought. Upon reflection I think the reason why I don't share your view is because I actually think the pump 'n dump mechanism has beneficial properties for bitcoin. Although it's ethically dubious, it might prevent greater harm by acting as a short circuit that prevents the price rising out of control. Without those 'scammer' elements, true believers would spiral this puppy right into the Sun. I've no doubt that the community contains toxic elements, but I see this as a form of mithridatism (where you ingest small quantities of poison to built a greater resistance to that poison).
Forgive me, I'm on a Nassim Taleb binge (could you guess by my obsession with itemizing black swans?). And so I can't help see the scammy aspects of the bitcoin community as elements that make bitcoin more anti-fragile to larger price manipulation. The manipulation *will* happen, and the Greater Whales will eventually dump, and so the businesses need to be anti-fragile to these crashes. I would argue that the scammy element has directly led to the innovative business models behind Bitpay and Coinbase. If we didn't have the pump and dumps, we might have gotten here without those protections in place. We're more anti-fragile now.
If bitcoin does ever achieve a usefulness that reflects its price, it'll be thanks to corporations that integrated the technology into their strategy plans, and made a fuckton of money from it. Our community will become as irrelevant to the future users of bitcoin as the early usenet groups are to the management of Google. So on that, I think we agree that this community is an artifact of this moment in time. Once corporations jerry rig the protocol into their money making machines, the ride will be over. We just disagree on why.

"So they chose random seeds until the curve met the criteria."
The reason for suspicion is because the selection criteria is likely to have exceeded the specified mandate. The sentiment is that the random seeds were selected for more than just the published criteria, and that the unpublished attributes they were selecting for were a weakness.
But regardless, fear and doubt is the correct stance to take when dealing with crypto. That's kinda the point. But just in case I'm wrong, I'll check back on the details in a year or two after I develop a larger base of cryptographic experience. This will likely be turned into a good case study.

I think coloured coins are the next big conceptual leap (a coloured coin is a satoshi that's been singled out as a token).. Some potential uses are:
* Smart property: Ownership of physical assets such as cars and cellphones can be represented as a token, and the device will only respond to the owner of the token.
* Company stock: A company could issue tokens representing shares in the company. The platform would easily allow sending Bitcoin dividends to shareholders, and allow shareholder to cryptographically vote.
* Deterministic contracts: A person or company can issue contracts specifying a particular future payment, such as a mining bond or a commodity option.
* Bonds: A special case of the above, bonds can be issued with a particular face value and repayment schedule, denominated in bitcoins or some other currency or commodity.
* Demand deposits: Similar to bonds, except the issuer guarantees to redeem the token for its face value at any time. This can be used as either an interest bearing instrument, or as a way to handle physical assets more eciently.
* Emergent currencies: A community may want to use a local currency which is similar technically to Bitcoin but detached from it monetarily. They can issue tokens for this purpose and distribute them among themselves in some fashion, and have them gain value organically through use rather than through some concrete backing.
* Decentralized digital representation of physical assets: This is a hypothetical use case that is not proven to be viable, but is eagerly anticipated by some groups. Over time, a consensus could arise that a token is commensurable in value to some traditional currency or commodity, without a specic backer apart from a bootstrapping period. This will allow digitally holding value tied to physical assets

The bitcoin protocol has much of this (and more), but it's not being used right now. The media hype we're having now is a bit silly, because people aren't even hyping the things that are really fascinating. Although to be fair, this kind of stuff can't happen until the currency is actually a 'good' currency, which requires a lot less volatility.
Long story short, when bitcoin becomes more stable and can finally be used as a good currency, then innovators will start implementing the cooler financial features of the bitcoin protocol.
It's programmable money, that's something people can't wrap their heads around until they see it. I get a feeling the last big 'bubble' will happen when these features get presented to the public. That's not going to be any time soon.

Unlike what MoreK believes, there is in fact a good answer. The world runs on profit. Until we find something better than Capitalism, the only thing that matters is profit. Profit is king. And anything that increases profit does so by increasing productivity or by decreasing inefficiencies. You either lay off staff or buy one of those new things called 'a computer' everyone's been talking about. It's the law of the land; any new innovation that can increase productivity or decrease inefficiencies is going to make it big. And that's where bitcoin is guaranteed a role in history. Unlike the wonderful dollar (or any other national fiat), bitcoin reduces the "friction" in financial transactions, and thus it reduces an inefficiency that business have had to accept all these centuries. It's like telling a business in 1970 that one day they would be able to cut down on inter-office mail. The cost of inter-office mail is small, but fuck it who doesn't want to save a tiny bit more money. And that was email.
If bitcoin can even save a tiny bit of money for corporations, then it's overwhelmingly better than fiat.
(and whether or not consumers use it, well that's irrelevant because pretty sure kids in highschool will be using the latest meme-turned crypto)
EDIT: Keep in mind that this doesn't guarantee that dumb regulation will make it unprofitable for businesses to adopt bitcoin. It's also possible that new types of social/technological attacks will be devised that can destroy the usefulness of the protocol. There's quite a few existential threats to bitcoin, but "intrinsic value" ain't one.

Because the thing that makes 256r1 compromised is a built in parameter that was chosen by the NSA. The number that the NSA chose was c49d360886e704936a6678e1139d26b7819f7e90, and presumably the reason they chose it is because they discovered a weakness when this specific number is used to generate the curve. In 256k1, that parameter is the number 7. We don't know if curves generated with the parameter of '7' also creates compromised curves, but its a fuckton less suspicious than what the NSA chose for 256r1. I think we're safe.

No, the April bubble was filled with fear and doubt about whether the US would actively try to kill it, and whether any real big companies would ever adopt it. Also the ATM was just a promise, and no one believed it was even possible (even the demo that spring was faced with concerns about how they would get around regulations).
What are people worried about this time? I honestly can't find any existential fears. China had nothing to contribute to the rise of bitcoin prior to September. And after September all it did was cheerlead the fuck out of the price. So now with China gone, people are afraid of where the price will go, but no one is afraid about new existential threats. So this bubble is entirely about price, and not about future survival. That's a pretty huge step forward!

This is a standards war. The technical differences are as irrelevant as they are trivial. Do a quick search for "HDDVD &amp; Bluray combo player" to see how manufacturers produced all sorts of combo devices that played both standards for quite while. This is comparable to how websites take payment/donations in both litecoin and bitcoin right now. It's trivial to do combo implementations, but that doesn't change the fact that eventually only one standard will win. There can be only one, not because of technical reasons, but because business people don't like redundancies. And no, you don't get to decide. It'll be industry that makes the final call. (seriously, do you think this is about which one you prefer? It's only ever going to be about what makes a corporation the most money in their deals and practices, and this is exactly what we're encouraging when we tell businesses to adopt cryptos)

Exactly this. China wanted to put a stop to the mass trading. They don't believe their citizens should invest in this kind of false currency. The measures they've taken will ensure that people can only deal with bitcoin on a very small (and therefor "safe") scale, ie in person. My guess for why they didn't ban bitcoins outright is because China see the future of bitcoin as a distributed asset registry, which would be something useful for tracking things and people, and which wouldn't require it to be exchanged like a currency. Of course that's just a guess..

Not really. The whole concept of "selling your bitcoins" is going to sound very weird to people one day. Tell me, do people "sell their dollars"? No. They "spend their dollars". The people that will buy BTC from ZipZap won't be seeing it as a commodity, they'll be seeing it as a means to make an online purchase (ie like buying a prepaid card for mobile phone, WoW or any other service that usually requires a credit card). The promise of bitcoin is that it allows (for the first time) commerce across all borders. That's why ZipZap is going into these countries, and that's why people will buy bitcoins, but won't understand the idea of "selling" bitcoins.

Some might say that the widespread adoption of bitcoins would be morally wrong because "technically most people are living paycheck to paycheck"..

When you reopened bitcoin-qt, it created a new wallet (which is why your bitcoins were not visible). Your original wallet is likely corrupted. You'll need to run some data recovery software to find/restore the wallet.dat (assuming it's not too far gone). In my experience, the vast amount of "undelete" and "recovery" software only detects common filetypes. You'll probably need to use more advanced software like R-Studio, and feed it a sample header for it to know what kind of data to look for. It could get complicated.
EDIT: and of course, DO NOT touch the harddrive. And of course do not install any of the recovery software on the harddrive either. Physically take the harddrive out of your computer, and connect it only using an external adapter. Assuming this drive was running your OS, you'll have to reinstall on a new drive.
Of course, it's entirely likely that you only had a few bucks worth of BTC, and all this trouble and time is worth less than the BTC you bought. I guess you have to weight the value of the BTC versus the donkeykong sized headache of restoring that wallet.dat file

I honestly think the people that took part of that meeting must be shaking their heads at us, wondering just how dumb people are. The news was neither "good" nor "bad".

Now you're talking! In the spirit of less words: If Ghash.io does anything stupid, there will indeed be a flight to LTC. And if the Greater Whales offload 100k+ coins at once, the crash won't stay at $0.0001 for more than a second before rebounding. It won't kill bitcoin because nothing will have changed, other than a massive redistribution of wealth.
And now, the long version (because I like hearing myself type):
I discounted all of those (except for the risk behind Ghash and BTCGuild, which I included in my analysis of the threat to the blockchain.. perhaps I should be more explicit that threats *from* the miners are threats to the blockchain, and thus would lead a flight to LTC).
I don't think I've ever had a chance to argue against the threat of large BTC holders (ie FBI, Satoshi, knightmb, etc) and how they don't pose a grave threat to bitcoin. So here goes:
Selling 100k-1,000k coins at once would crash the price across all the exchanges. You could easily push the price **back** to $0.01. It could be done, and in fact it could be done several times over. But if this was done in the future, it wouldn't kill bitcoin. Rather, it would just be a hugeass flash crash. It would certainly be destabilizing, but volatility is the name of this game. Crashing the price to $0.01 by mass selloff is only going to result in a massive redistribution of those coins (as well as the usual fear and panic that accompanies a big crash). But by the time this happens (if it happens), the public, and business and government will have already witnessed several large bitcoin crashes. This will simply be the biggest. And people, having seen the price recover over and over again, will go on about their lives, and wish that they had been able to buy during those seconds when millionaires were made from just $10.

TLDR: bitcoins might in theory allow universal global mercantilism, and in doing so it might reverse the power dynamics between consumers and merchants. But this will depend on mass adoption in India and China as a means of commerce. So far that's not happening, but the story isn't over yet. 
One of the promises of bitcoin is to partially reverse the Mathew Effect of capitalism ( I think most people would agree that capitalism has led to large concentrations of power and wealth, and this is because successful commerce has required large capitalization (ie, you need money to make money). We've seen that the internet has drastically reduced the capital require to start a successful business, and that trend is ongoing. Anyone can start a business online (assuming they have sufficient time to learn the technicals). So the amount of capitalization is approaching zero (and it might actually reach zero thanks to free wifi and community resources). But so far, being able to provide a useful product/service/content online has not meant you were able to monetize it. Even Google Adsense requires a bank account to deposit the funds to.
But with bitcoin, there's finally a PROMISE to monetize the Long Tail ( at least when it comes to the knowledge economy (the manufacturing sector will be next, assuming 3D printing continues it's trajectory). I use the word 'promise' because we haven't actually reached this capability yet, but the intension is very much there at present. And I believe that the Long Tail is vastly longer than what we see right now, because there's 1.2 billion people in India and 1.3 in China alone who don't have a way to monetize their services. Both India and China have an elitist culture that promotes engineers and science/math pursuits. So their population is full of people capable of contributing useful services/content to the world. Perhaps the vast majority of these populations are currently poor and under-educated, but their governments are adamant that they can grow their middle class over the coming decades. And with bitcoin, this group of under-banked producers can begin to sell you things.
Now, it's almost certain that with an increase in merchants, especially from parts of the world with lower ethical standards and less regulation, there's going to be a massive amount of fraud and risk. But that's to be expected with a transition to mass mercantilism (ie when everyone is a merchant). Thankfully, we have innovations in reputation systems, as well as trust-free systems (even built right into the bitcoin protocol, but currently unused) that should alleviate some of that fraud/risk.
[I'm going to veer into way more speculative territory now, and I'm completely clear that this is very likely half-baked, but it's fun to examine, even if it's wrong]
There also seems to be a cultural shift in how we might view buying and selling goods. Right now, the cultural view is that money is power, and therefor a buyer is powerful (because the buyer has the money, whereas the seller is interested in trading for that money). I'm curious to see if that will also reverse. What you experienced was a reversal of power where selling is power. If bitcoin leads to hoarding (read: saving), then the consumer demand for goods will decrease, thus leading to a lower price for goods than you'd otherwise have if demand was high (ie if there's a limited number of laptops available and demand is high, the merchant will price them higher, but if the demand is lower, then the price will also be lower, assuming that it's still profitable to manufacture the laptops with the lower demand, which is where advanced next-gen 3D printing comes into the picture). So the point is that with lower prices caused by 'delayed spending' due to a trend towards hoarding, the sellers will be more powerful. This seems counter intuitive, but the premise is that power goes to whoever has the most options for trade. In our current system, dollars have more trading options than specific goods. In a world with universal global commerce, a specific product will be perceived as more tradable than a buyer's bitcoin, because the buyer is a hoarder, and they only want to spend their bitcoin on a specific thing that they absolutely need, while the seller has the option to shop his goods to the entire world population, who by their saving-mentality, are desperate for the goods they buy (because people have limited their buying to only the things their desperate for, and saving the rest). So merchants that survive this reduction in consumerism will have more power. By hoarding, you decrease your power as a consumer, and the balance goes in favour of the vendor who now has you at their mercy. The silver lining is that with universal global mercantilism, there will always be trusted merchants who continue to court consumers, but fundamentally the power will be reversed. The "customer is always right" might not apply anymore.
Having said all that, China has made clear that they won't allow this to happen, not yet at least. Like they did with the internet, they're going to control its adoption. That doesn't mean it will never be used for commerce in China, simply that when it does get adopted, it'll be limited to what China determines is safe relative to their economy and political plans. We don't yet know if India will do the same.
So the promise is there. Time will tell if it'll be realized.
EDIT/ADDENDUM: China has built itself up as the manufacturing supplier to the world. I think it would be vastly more interesting, and profitable, if they complimented that by also becoming the knowledge-information supplier to the world. India has tried to do that with offshoring, and has found some success, but I think the potential scale, and the domains it can be applied to, is much greater with a decentralized approach that's enabled with the adoption of bitcoin as the vehicle of commerce.
