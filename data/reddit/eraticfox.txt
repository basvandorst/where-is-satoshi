They have been in a more or less permanent recession since the 90s, so maybe a bit less than you think

Is this bounce anything to do with the Russia/Ukraine situation?

Dogecoin became popular when loads of people bought ASIC miners for bitcoin and quickly realised that they would pretty much break even as the difficulty was rising so quickly. They turned to mine anything that would make them money according to coinwarz, which was amongst other things dogecoin

OK I'm at home. 
$17-$21= 23.5% gain
$15.12 -$16.35 = 8.1% gain
Your first statement is still wrong. As I previously stated I'm not holding so no butt hurt. Stop crying. You got it a bit wrong and you were buzzing off you approx 8% gain. I'm happy for you :)

Amazon doesn't need the publicity, I had never heard of Overstock still they started selling BTC. So even if they lost some money in BTC volatility it basically can be put down as advertising costs

Pre Huobi news ($14) to LTC on Huobi ($21) = 50% gain
Flash crash low ($15.12) to Pump peak ($16.35) =  8.1% gain
Even if you made several successful trades you would be struggling to match that, so it is you who has not done the numbers.
No butt hurt. I am sitting in fiat, and have been since LTC went on Huobi.

True. I think many people were stung when they pre-ordered miners from sites like butterflylabs which then took ages to come. If they had invested there money in btc it they would have made a lot more. 
All I meant is that there were miners looking to mine something other than btc or ltc.
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:42:02
I do and you realise not everyone jumped on the btc and ltc bandwagon in time?

If they are so concerned about money laundering they should crack down on big banks like HSBC

Well you obviously didn't do well on the Huobi news, which doesn't say much about your skillz

I suggest you read "Guns, Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamond. Helps explain the reasons as to why some areas developed faster than others. Very interesting read

Why does this sub only seem to post the price, plenty of other sites for that?

Pointing out a fallacy in your statement was necessary. I'm sorry you didn't find it nice. Please don't cry
