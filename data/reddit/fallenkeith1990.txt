@_date: 2018-09-06 14:46:33
good morning my bitcoin loving friends
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:04:21
im still astonished at the stories where people got houses for $1 during the crisis lol
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:00:14
good morning friends, i hope you have a nice day!

i offloaded a bunch that i bought at 5900 when it was in the 7.3 range, i noticed that it was having a lot of trouble breaking that wall, but i never invest more than i can afford to lose, so it wasn't much :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:07:29
this is literally every bagholder, ever. I can't even visit a community today without someone shouting one of these
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:11:21
good night friends, don't let the bears get you down :)
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:55:22
honestly, with bitcoin halving in a few years, it's not a bad idea to buy anytime this year i would imagine, i mean heck, I never imagined bitcoin would shoot up from $200 to $20k
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:35:28
my GPU is infernal...constantly...lol...
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:25:05
honestly i dont understand why people FUD bitcoin, considering that the entire market is tied to bitcoin, the market will die if bitcoin dies lol
people should want bitcoin to succeed so the entire market can succeed, not just price-wise, but since bitcoin is also at the forefront of adoption
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:13:12
considering wells fargo freezes my accounts for absolutely no reason like 5 times a month, i can see why i personally prefer bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:02:39
no doggies to fight the bears and bulls?
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:22:26
yep, the sad part is that a lot of people fail to see how good bitcoin is
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:31:33
good morning and good luck on your trades / cryptoactivities today everyone :)
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:12:23
well...if I saw my coin go from 2 cents to 74...I would have dumped it too, and brought bitcoin and literally any other coin asap haha
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:05:21
i remember when bitcoin was  20k, 600 and even 30 :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:32:15
lol never knew that's where it came from, thought it was from random memes
thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:13:47
much more devoid of centralization compared to banks :)
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:40:40
that's what I keep telling people, 100k isn't as far-fetched as a lot of people believe, especially with the halving happening
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:50:17
just HODL it'll go to the moon any day now :)
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:53:13
hmm 5k seems like a bit off, but in this market it could happen 5 min from now or 5 months from now, never know lol
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:39:41
i'm pretty bullish on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:37:38
oh cool, you visit BTC too, but yeah you should see it here as well
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:55:56
i'm still...
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:09:06
we bounced, getting even more bullish.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:16:55
these bears make me bullish on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:13:46
good morning my friends :)
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:10:13
ill never understand why people hate bitcoin, if bitcoin dies....every crypto in existance would drop to near 0 or be near valueless thanks to the market being ran parallel to it...we should want bitcoin to succeed, no matter what
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:34:02
i really think alot of the fud against btc is unjustified
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:56:42
i fell asleep and i keep getting woken up. My aunt came by and she was wearing a bitcoin t-shirt...I wonder if my sleepiness and my aunt wearing a bitcoin t-shirt is a good sign?
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:12:04
dang 7.3k
@_date: 2018-07-07 14:37:39
ha i always wondered why it was called a bart
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:18:54
be careful since that hopium is addicting, you're going to create a lot of new hopium addicts :)
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:10:03
^ exactly
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:18:07
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:54:02
wah it went up, nice! haha
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:49:39
hmm interesting
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:10:38
bitcoin will be $100,000 in  2 weeks....I have proof! *points to TA* :)
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:45:12
...is this a bullrun? :(
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:17:45
not yet i think, but close!
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:41:49
...over 9000 memes...oh god, so much vegeta...
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:59:27
but you can magnify your investments with altcoins lol
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:25:14
guys, remember that bitcoin was only 2k this time last year...we've done a 300% in one year, which in and of itself is absolutely amazing!
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:45:54
honestly, i cant really say. but i love this community and everyone is very friendly. So I think it will attract alot of new people :)
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:41:04
remember : accumulate all the coins you can (btc included ofc and especially alts from airdrops) for when another bull run begins, then you should be golden since everything will rise and you can have even more bitcoin from altcoins :)
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:03:34
i tried a uk proxy and it did not work, but my native ip (US) works...weird...
why would they block it in the uk?
@_date: 2018-07-07 14:13:18
hmm never heard of that one, what is it?
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:44:01
i dont think you can use credit cards with coinbase anymore (at least in the USA), otherwise it sounds good imo
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:18:54
hmm this reminds me of that old jennifer meme
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:26:44
hi we're mooning
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:08:46
we're mooning guys!
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:10:34

@_date: 2018-07-07 06:37:05
