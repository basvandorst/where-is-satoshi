You can only purchase BTC on these, right? Not exchange BTC for the local currency? If that's the case, it seems odd to call them ATMs.

Looking at the raw numbers really isn't informative because, obviously, the size of the economy involving U.S. dollars completely overshadows the BTC economy.
As a % of the economy, it would be interesting if you could compare U.S. dollar and BTC. I have no idea how that comparison would play out. At least in its earlier days, I suspect the % was large for BTC and the U.S. dollar, though with increased adoption, I trust that number is going down.

I feel like this is missing some important comparisons. Like how much power is consumed per user of each service/network. Not doubt incredibly hard to calculate, and I have no idea who would come out on top. 
Without some per user perspective it hard to see how much more green one is than the other. And naturally, if use of Bitcoin actually grows to rival credit card companies, that's going to be a lot more people using some kind of technology to make transactions (not counting a likely increase in mining).

No necessary correlation perhaps, but in practical terms, if Bitcoin ever really takes off, a lot more people/companies will want to be able to get in on the transactions fees I'm sure. Which is part of what mining does, right?
