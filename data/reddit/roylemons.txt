Scalability is just is important. it's just that most people don't understand that there's good scaling and bad scaling.

It's an escrow service, you don't need to meet up IRL, and they have been in the game for a long time and are very reputable.

That was my point as well. Decentralization and security is worthless without scalability as well. Scaling onchain by simply raising the block size is a naive solution to the problem that leaves technical debt, and in my eyes a downgrade to scalability as well. Minimizing transaction size and using lighting is much more efficient.

This! People always ask me if now is the time or whatever. I tell them that I'd never recommend anyone to buy Bitcoin, but I'm happy to explain it and tell them where to read up on it as it's awesome.
