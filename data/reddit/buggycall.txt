Thanks for the explanation, that's indeed what I thought!

Not likely unless you get residential address in both US and China...The difficulty will be on withdrawing local fiat. For example, to arbitrage Bitcoin price difference between China and US you usually will : (1)deposit CNY --&gt; (2)buy BTC at Chinese exchange --&gt; (3)send BTC to your account in US exchange --&gt;(4)sell BTC --&gt; (5)withdraw USD. The difficulty will be on (5) because unless you're a US citizen or resident, exchanges there(or most of the world) won't allow you to withdraw USD(or other local currency if you're in other country).

the fee and delay for setting up a lightening network channel looks a bit tedious and expensive to me, no?

They only monopolize hash power, not anything else. I still believe consumers/users should collectively overpower mining pools. I do feel some of 2Xers are hostile and intend to attack/undermine bitcoin wishfully thinking they could benefit from the chaos but I don't want to worry too much as bitcoin has to be resilient enough to undertake the expectations we're putting on it otherwise we better look for something else. That being said, I am still very confident we could sail through this coming 2X fork.

My rationale is this (may not be sensible at all and I would love to be corrected):
* The total money supply by the end of 2015, according to [here]( take its definition of **BROAD MONET**, is 80.9 trillion USD (80.9x10^12 USD).
* The total amount of bitcoin is (roughly) 21 million, equals to 21x10^14 satoshis.
* If bitcoin is used as a global currency, that mean each satoshi will be worth of roughly 0.025 USD.
* *My assumption* To be used for daily trade, the minimal unit of bitcoin has to be able to at least accommodate the smallest exchange units. A satoshi is worth of 0.025 USD, which equals to around 3 Japanese Yen(assume 1 USD = 120 JPY), may not be granular enough as a replacement for JPY or any other country with lower exchange rates to USD.
In addition to that, it's also hard to be believe any government in major countries will abandon their monopoly of mintage and adopt bitcoin as official currency -- for good or bad, every government just wants to control money supply since it's one of the major source of their power.
