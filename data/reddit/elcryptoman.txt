Here is my thinking:
1) Absolutely no one know how high the Bitcoin will go.
2) Absolutely no one knows when there is indeed a bubble.
3) Most of the times we buy at ATH.  That doesn't mean is wrong.  The ATH from 2 years ago is today's long gone dream price.
4) The cryptos have developed into another asset class imho , therefore, a 1-1.5% of one's wealth is a sensible thought.
5) Diversify.  Don't buy only the BTC
6) Even if BTC goes to 1 million, it would be far fetched to think that the main fiat currencies will be worthless.
7) Conclusion: 1-1.5% in cryptos (money you can afford to loose without consequences), diversify, long-term buy and hold strategy, absolutely no retirement funds
8) Sleep well and have fun

If you had waited a little bit longer you could have bought not a house, but houses!

I just bought a little bit on Coinbase just to see how it goes.
After 10 minutes still 0 confirmations

My last night Bitcoin purchase from Coinbase came through at 3:30 pm today.  Just bought some more!

Slush, Thank you so much for supporting one of the most important assets of our times!  
Bitcoin will remain King no matter what!

Do you make money with a node?

I hope you're right!  I think you're right!  I am never selling my BTC anyway.  So for me it doesn't matter.  I'm buying as of matter of fact.

How does that work?  I would appreciate it if you can explain further.
How do I secure my money.

Thank you

Don't hold your breath.  If I learned anything about the crypto is that nobody knows anything for sure.  I wouldn't be surprised that BTC reached 30k by year end.

I need to watch one of those videos where they proclaim BTC will hit 1 million....
In all seriousness, don't forget these bear markets are nothing new.  Believers, HODL!

People from Ledger maintain that you can safely buy a used one.  Their technology is different than trezor.

But if you do this your taxes are going to be a nightmare!

What do I do if I sell a lot of Bitcoins, hence, I owe a lot in taxes, but because there is limit in how much fiat you can withdraw from exchanges I don't have enough cash to meet the tax liability ?  What people should do?  Take a personal loan?

You are so right!
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:07:48
You have a point.  But we need that kind of market cap so it will be just as big as any fiat currency.  There are enough decimals to make it work and to be adopted as the preferred currency.

And we have a new Nostradamus among us people!

How certain are you about the pump?
