Bitconnect collapsing is a massively negative yet legitimate story. If you try to brush aside or dismiss that, you're mad.

The dotcom bubble was almost 20 years ago, and a lot of people did in fact go bust. Only the small minority that survived became successful. 
Crypto will go the exact same way. Most investors won't survive such a transition, **especially** small time investors.

As someone who worked in a banking call centre from 2005 to 2009, here's my take on the issue. 
Pretty much the first thing you realise when working for a bank, is that many people are just terrible with money. I saw many scenarios, but it usually came down to a) a lack of attentiveness with bills, and/or b) living beyond one's means.
When it came to overdrafts, too many downright abused them, despite the interest fees and charges. You'd get Mr Joe Blogs calling in pleading that he didn't have enough overdraft to pay his mortgage, despite having just arrived back from an expensive vacation. Of course, if the overdraft extension wasn't approved, it would be "the bank's fault", not the fact he pissed away his money without any care for bills.
That being said, I did take pity on some, usually either poor students, or those who had experienced some financial black swan event. If I saw some effort on the customer's part to manage their money, I'd generally go out of my way to help them. To put it bluntly, it was actually a breath of fresh air to be able to help those who weren't self-destructive idiots.
To conclude, what do I think about the headline "$6.4 Billion in Overdraft Fees"? It doesn't ring any alarm bells for me. That's pocket change in the banking sector. Furthermore, overdrafts are generally less punitive and easier to manage now than ever thanks to, wait for it, financial regulation protecting the consumer. In any case, if you have even basic skills managing money, then overdrafts should not pose any problems.

@_date: 2018-01-18 06:23:31
You're not wrong, but the way I see it, BCC ending operations is merely the silver lining, with a lot of damage being done behind it.
Think of it like being a runaway train with no driver. When it crashes, that's good in the sense that the threat is over, however if it killed a bunch of people on the way, that's not much of a cheering point to most.
Overall, when I say it's mostly bad news, I'm saying that because I'm not just looking at BCC, or the events of this week. I'm looking at the whole timeline of all of crypto. BCC to me is a big red flag, because if it existed, then others surely do too, and there aren't safeguard to stop more BCC type scams from popping up. BCC is symbolic of wider issue in this space. That's why I view these recent events as bad.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:03:04
Sure, but the fact remains that many in this space throw around numbers with little to no basis. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:51:04
That depends really. School formations are effective against smaller predators, that are smaller than the school mass. Against massive whales however, it's not really an effective strategy, since the whale can and will swallow the entire school in one go, [like this.](
As to how that analogy shapes up in the crypto sphere is an open question. I suspect the crypto whales are firmly in control, due to how much of the market they control, and the influential connections they have. Furthermore, looking at the small/newbie investors, the community may have grown in size, but is it stronger? One could argue, no. Most people who have joined the game now are just in it to get rich quick, and often can't agree on (or don't care) how crypto should move forward. With greed and lack of consensus being so prominent, big whales definitely have the clear advantage, imo.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:04:51
Granted, the scam that was BCC had to end, but you do realise many people actually got severely hurt with the collapse right? Sure they were foolish and misguided, but only a sociopath would call the BCC collapse "good news".
Aside from the fact vulnerable people got hurt, the other reason the BCC collapse is bad news, is it damages the crypto sphere's reputation as a whole. BCC was not only able to exist, but become one of the biggest cryptos, yet was a clear scam. Now people will be questioning what other parts of crypto are a scam, and quite frankly they'd be sensible to ask such questions.
If you care at all about crypto, this is all much more bad than good as a whole.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:27:29
Ironic that you've cherry picked only one type of bias, which happens to fit your narrative. By doing so, you're exercising [selection bias.](
Listen, bias goes both ways, i.e. [choice-supportive bias]( and negative bias. Also, not everything is a product of bias. If something is supported by robust **evidence**, then it's fact, not bias.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:29:05
Worth adding that even when Bitcoin is viewed as a currency, it has become a pretty terrible one at that, due to the terrible handling of the lead developers to ensure Bitcoin is scalable in a mass market. 
As things stand, fees to transact Bitcoin are obscenely high, as are transaction times. There was all this talk about progress, yet much of it has fallen flat. Stage one of Segwit did little to improve Bitcoin as a currency, and stage two was flat-out cancelled. Now they're talking about the Lightning network, yet that has seen multiple delays too. 
It's almost as if the high fees are making the elite of Bitcoin so much money, they don't want such problems fixed. Never underestimate the power and influence of greed. It's as prevalent in crypto as anywhere else.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:07:39
Just to clarify, I'm not refuting the presence of negativity bias. I'm merely pointing out that by singling out that one type of bias, and associating it exclusively with negative press, you're actually showing bias yourself, specifically selection bias, driven by choice-supportive bias. To deny such an observation would (quite frankly), be hypocritical.
Understand, rule number  of cognitive bias is that everyone is bias in some ways to some degree. It's unavoidable. That's especially true of Reddit subreddit communities like and where positive press is often celebrated without questions, and negative press is immediately dismissed as FUD, often regardless of the facts. This may not be a reality everyone here can admit to, but it's a reality nonetheless.

You're right that average people don't make up most of crypto money/capital, however average people do make up the vast majority of the crypto demographic.
Put another way, the market is made up a few huge whales, and a multitude of minnows. As things stand, the minnows seem to think they can overpower and outsmart the whales. We all know how that would end in the ocean, and it'll probably end the same way with crypto too.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:02:27
To clarify, I'm saying it's bad news because it has brought crypto as a whole into disrepute. You have to remember the damage caused isn't limited to BCC and its investors. It hurts everyone. Also, James Dimon is looking a lot more credible now, even though his comments were largely about BTC, not BCC.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:30:43
Because the market is largely driven by speculation and perception. Such subjective drivers do not operate in clean little bubbles, where one thing being affected or crashing has zero effect on the rest of the ecosystem. This is a basic fundamental of speculative investing you should really know, if you have any money in crypto at all.
Also, I understand BCC was buying BTC with incoming funds. Would surprise me at all if BCC started selling off their BTC when the bottom fell under. That would not only directly hit BTC, but the entire crypto space.

Andreas Antonopoulos is excellent at educating the crypto community. 
That being said, we should not take even his advice on blind faith. At the end of the day, he's invested in Crypto, and therefore has a vested interest in promoting the technology. Remember, no one is immune to bias, so we should critically evaluate any and all advice, especially in something as volatile as crypto.

The price hasn't been at $4k since early April, almost 4 months ago. I wouldn't exactly call that just "a few weeks ago". 
Either way, it's all relative. Anyone who bought during the late June or early July highs, is down on those investments. It all depends on what price someone went in at.

If you want an open, decentralised currency, that isn't tied to any governments, then overnight price changes is something you'll have to deal with. There are pros and cons with any system.
That being said, if the price is changing so much overnight that it's viewed as a potential problem, then the real issue is volatility, not geography. The speculative nature of bitcoin is out of control at the moment.

@_date: 2017-09-16 21:23:11
Completely agree. It's very obvious that much of the Bitcoin community don't actually give a shit about Bitcoin, or its real world potential, instead choosing to view it as a get rich quick scheme.
Even the people in the community who have latched onto Bitcoin as an anti-establishment device, are often just pointing to the share price, rather than any real world utility.
Just look at the front page at any given time. It's awash with memes and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Bitcoin doesn't just need support, it needs the right kind of support, and if this sub is anything to go by, it's woefully lacking in that department. I'd liken to only at the other end of the spectrum.

Sure, some good things came out of the dot-com bubble, but vastly more bad came out of it, and we can't even say that the little good we saw, wouldn't have happened anyway with healthier growth.
Basically what I'm saying is, if we take a microscope and focus on specific elements of good and bad, we tend to lose sight of the big picture, and the big picture says the dot-com crash did vastly more harm than good, broadly speaking.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:43:20

This will go against the circlejerk, but someone needs to say it.
Financial institutions aren't threatened by bitcoin at all. Hedge funds and investment banks in particular are actually playing the bitcoin market like a fiddle. They're buying and selling cryptocurrencies to such a vast degree, that they're actually manipulating these markets, and making a killing in the process. 
Don't make the mistake of thinking you have these huge organizations over a barrel. If anything it's the other way around, even if you've managed to ride the wave without being pulled under to this point.

Exactly. There are two types of bitcoin supporter at the moment, people who treat it like a currency, and people who treat it like a get rich quick scheme. 
The former group is absolutely what bitcoin needs to succeed, not the latter. Self-serving investors may actually be forcing bitcoin into a bubble (just like the dot-com crash), and dooming its prospect without even realising it.
