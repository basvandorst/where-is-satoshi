Even if it's wrong, it isn't illegal with Bitcoin. That's the price of having an unregulated market.

I'm friends with a couple that told me how much they were approved for, and even given that I know the parents of one of them are providing the down payment and my reaction was still, "In what fucking world?!"
Seriously approved for a mortgage that would be like 80% of their income.

Start an ICO for a shitcoin. Just let me know first so I can get in on the pump. All you need is a website with some marketing terms. Bonus points if you plagiarize some whitepapers and mash together technical jargon. 
Then all you need to do is scream FUD and shill whenever anyone calls you out about your obvious scam. Fuck, just get some people to help you by letting them get in on the ICO early so they can cash out before it all collapses.
