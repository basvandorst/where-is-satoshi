These are very clearly fake reviews. To address the three that are shown in full one by one:
_"Shinra Holdings"_
Bitcoin Cash was not created in part by the wallet's developer / author, nor by Roger Ver. It was created by hard-forking the original Bitcoin (with Segwit) chain and this effort was led by Amaury Séchet with absolutely no creative nor development input by the wallet's creator.
It is not at all possible to lose any Bitcoin sent to any Bitcoin Cash address in the wallet as you can very easily create a Bitcoin wallet from the Bitcoin Cash seed phrase, instantly recovering the BTC. Ergo the statement that "Millions of dollars have been lost to date" in the wallet is entirely false - in fact it is not even possible to lose funds within the wallet by having Bitcoin sent to an address in the Bitcoin Cash wallet as you, and only you, have full control of the private key to that address. This makes recovery a very simple process and we even have step by step instructions for this in our Wallet Support FAQ should anybody make this mistake.
We also have wallet support available via email 7 days a week to assist users if necessary.
The explanation above applies to this fake review also; $130 did not go "down the drain". If perchance it is not a fake review and the situation did indeed occur then the $130 was sent to an address which the user holds the private key for, and thus they can recover their funds with ease.
"Novacek Michal"
The wallet allows you to create both BTC and BCH wallets so yes, it *is* a real Bitcoin wallet. Furthermore it is not possible for the wallet to steal funds as it is an entirely non-custodial wallet, so the only person with any control over their funds is the user herself/himself.

Well at least if nothing else we can both agree that bigger blocks are the way forward. Though I have to disagree when you state that we are deliberately misleading people. We are not, and have no such intent. What would we have to gain by intentionally misleading people in such a manner? On the purchasing page we also have a '?' button beside each option that brings you to one of the following pages depending on whether you wish to purchase Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin (Core - the Core development team's implementation of Bitcoin):
It is our belief that Bitcoin Cash _is_ Bitcoin insofar as it is the closest version of Bitcoin to that described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. We feel that it has more 'right' to the name Bitcoin than the Core development team's implementation of Bitcoin, hence the term 'Bitcoin Core'. Although perhaps using the term 'Bitcoin Segwit' would have been more correct in a technical sense as once Segwit was implemented via soft fork it became a different version of Bitcoin, albeit the one which had the longest chain, with most proof of work.
BCH is indeed an upgrade as it upgrades the network's transaction capacity with a reduction in fees as a byproduct of that. There is nothing at all misleading about calling a spade a spade, or in this case calling an upgrade an upgrade. I wasn't involved in the decision making process in relation to the terms on the block explorer so I cannot comment on the thought process behind that, but Bitcoin.com is a privately owned business and a privately owned website; as such, it is the entity which owns it - and only that entity - who gets to decide which version of Bitcoin they would prefer to support, and how they support it.
The difference between the two cryptocurrencies is made very clear to users before they attempt to purchase either, and misleading people is not and was never Bitcoin.com's intention. Our intention was and is to support Bitcoin Cash as the true iteration of Bitcoin, and work hard to help undo the damage that has been done by the Core development team's drive to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer rather than peer-to-peer electronic cash available to _everyone_, from the banker in a high rise apartment in the first world to the farmhand in a home built from scrap in the third world.
I can see how there may have been _potential_ for confusion, but to say that we intentionally misled people when we provide information about both cryptocurrencies prior to purchase is a big jump indeed.

Rather than blindly state that I have been the subject of propaganda and manipulation (the same of which could be said for anyone attempting to push one side of an argument over another), would it perhaps not be more useful to attack the points I raised in an attempt to counter those arguments?
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:00:40
Bitcoin Cash's 'worthiness' is entirely subjective from individual to individual, and that should have no bearing on its actual title. I did not correct you on any term at all - I simply explained to you that our wallet does not support bcash as you were either being derogatory or confused; you may have been confused judging by the fact that you stated it was possible to send bitcoins to a bcash address in our wallet app when our wallet does not support bcash at all.
Bitcoin Cash actually has a stronger claim to the term 'Bitcoin' than Core's implementation of it when viewed through the lens of the actual Bitcoin whitepaper. Perhaps you would prefer that I call Core's implementation of it "Bitcoin Segwit" as that is what it forked to? Calling it "Bitcoin" would be disingenuous as once Segwit was implemented it stopped _being_ Bitcoin and became Bitcoin-Segwit (as it is now not possible to remove Segwit without hard forking).
I haven't engaged in any hypocrisy at all; indeed I explained the reason I used that specific term in parenthesis when I mentioned 'Bitcoin Core': **_(i.e. the Core development team's implementation of Bitcoin)_**
I did this specifically to ensure that you understood I was referring to the Core development team's version of Bitcoin, though this may have gone over your head or not been picked up on.
EDIT: correcting a spelling error.
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:41:43
I know you're probably just using 'bcash' as a derogatory term for Bitcoin Cash, but just to clarify it's not possible to send bitcoins to a bcash address in our wallet as our wallet doesn't support [bcash]( at all. It supports only Bitcoin Core (i.e. the Core development team's implementation of Bitcoin) and Bitcoin Cash.
To answer your question in terms of sending bitcoins to a Bitcoin Cash address, no, you don't see them showing up in the app as they have been sent on a different blockchain.
Now that you mention it though, that would indeed be an **excellent** feature to have and would certainly help mitigate any confusion that may arise - I'll mention it to the devs and see if there's any possibility of implementing such a feature.
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:52:27
I'm afraid you've been misinformed; the version of Bitcoin which Roger Ver supports isn't [Bcash]( at all. [Bcash]( is a cryptocurrency that uses the existing Bitcoin ledger combined with Zcash privacy technology. You can read more about that cryptocurrency by clicking on '[Bcash]( anywhere in this post.
Although you do seem to be rather confused about what Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and [Bcash]( actually are I will continue the discussion as though you understand that [Bcash]( is a Bitcoin/Zcash mashup and Bitcoin Cash is the cryptocurrency which was created via hard fork to return to the version of Bitcoin which had existed since the genesis block (ignoring the March, 2013 'hard fork' which was technically both a hard fork and not a hard fork depending on which definition you use).
After clearing that up, I must disagree with your statement that Bitcoin Cash has no claim at all to the name [term] Bitcoin, although you make my argument quite succinctly in your own post. Bitcoin Cash was indeed forked from "the real bitcoin" - whilst also more closely following the **[original Bitcoin whitepaper]( - and this does give it a stronger claim to the term 'Bitcoin' from a technical point of view. Ignoring all of the civil war nonsense from both sides, from a technical viewpoint Bitcoin Cash _is_ Bitcoin - certainly a lot more than Bitcoin-Segwit is Bitcoin.
You do also seem to be ignoring the fact that 'Bitcoin' in its current guise is _also_ a fork of "the real bitcoin". With the implementation of Segwit via soft fork, Bitcoin changed from what we both agree _was_ Bitcoin into an entirely different animal.


I'm not sure what [Bcash]( does as I have no interest in that combination of Bitcoin with Zcash, however assuming that you are trying to talk about Bitcoin Cash your attempts to make Bitcoin Cash into some sort of "currency of the 1%" seems to be ignoring the fact that the Lightning Network results in the exact opposite of what you claim - and which I agree - Bitcoin is:


The kinds of solutions being put forth as methods to improve Bitcoin (i.e. Lightning Network) literally make Bitcoin the opposite of everything you and I _both_ want Bitcoin to be:
[Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling Solution](
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:36:31
We are not misleading people at all. We make it very clear using tickers which cryptocurrency is which, and we make the exact same amount (2.5% of the amount) when a user purchases BCH as we do when they purchase BTC.
It is our view that Bitcoin has been crippled by 'second-layer scaling solutions' which do little to actually address the situation of high fees and full blocks. This in turn is detrimental to adoption and reduces the use cases of Bitcoin, particularly as a fast, cheap method of transferring value.
It's not enough to have low fees and quick transactions _some_ of the time, which only _some_ people can afford. Bitcoin Cash brings Bitcoin back to what it should be (particularly compared to a soluiton like the Lightning Network) - peer to peer electronic cash with instant transfers which cost virtually nothing.
Speaking as someone who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011 I **love** Bitcoin. I've breathed Bitcoin since the very first minute I found out about it, and I've been absolutely in love with it since! It's absolutely world changing and I wish that no hard fork had been necessary, but it was necessary. Bitcoin has been morphed into a settlement layer by vested interests, namely Blockstream, with a lot to gain financially by doing so.
I'm not here to beat down on Bitcoin at all. It's just not the Bitcoin that I've put everything into over the past 7 years, and its promise has been dulled under the chains of 'second-layer solutions'. We're promoting something that we believe is the right option to returning Bitcoin to its original use case; peer-to-peer peer to peer electronic cash with instant transfers which cost virtually nothing, available to all.
Lots of people will disagree with that and that's absolutely fine, in fact it should be encouraged! That's the beauty of open source development and the free market at work. We need to let the markets decide over time which cryptocurrency has the most utility. In 5 years time that might be neither Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash, it might be something else entirely, but we should all be working towards making whichever version of Bitcoin we believe in the absolute best that it can be. To me, full blocks, high fees and centralisation in the form of the Lightning Network just doesn't fit with my view of what Bitcoin is and what it should be going forward, that's all.
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:22:07
Not quite; my argument is that they can import their BCH wallet seed as a BTC wallet within the wallet app itself (as you can create both a BCH and BTC wallet with the same seed if you wish, which will contain all the same addresses) and recover any funds they accidentally send to the wrong chain.
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:53:52
Most of you don't know Roger very well, and a lot of what is written about him is coloured by 'Bitcoin civil war politics', for lack of a better term.
To answer your question, first off I should state that I consider Roger a very good friend first and foremost, and he's one of the very few people who has earned my complete trust through his actions.
If you took the time to get to know Roger you'd quickly find that he's quite frankly one of the most genuine, kind and rational people you'll ever meet. He possesses absolutely no malice and that's a quality that is quite rare in today's 'dog-eat-dog' world. I've been supported by his friendship through some incredibly tough times in my life - indeed that continues to this day - and he has been there for me despite how incredibly busy he always is; most importantly, he has done this without asking anything in return. He has earned my friendship and my absolute respect, two things which must always be earned.
Aside from the fact that we are both also anarcho-capitalists and share pretty much the exact same views on everything (which certainly does help people get along), the reason we both got involved in Bitcoin was because we both saw its huge potential to provide economic freedom to every single individual on the planet, and its promise as a means of regaining individual liberties by limiting the power of governments
The politics behind the above is all a discussion for a different forum/subreddit, of course, but to cut it relatively short: Roger's not in this to become a 'leader' or a 'notable figure' of any sort, and he's certainly not in it just to make money - it's no secret that he doesn't need to do that; he's in this to help further Bitcoin's promise of liberating individuals, limiting the power of governments to control those individuals and giving everyone in the world an equal opportunity to engage in free, voluntary trades.
Spend some time actually talking to Roger if you ever get the chance; I can guarantee that you'll quickly realise how wrong the people slating his character are.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:04:49
I've never really given the question much thought, but given the number of people working at Bitcoin.com, yes, I do think I'm in the majority.
I'm not sure I can engage in a logical discussion with someone who believes sockpuppeting on the internet is in any way similar to anything that occurred under the Nazis, even from a 'potential propaganda' perspective, but the issue has been addressed here:
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:11:31
Done - thanks for letting me know, thieflar!
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:42:25


Indeed, and neither he nor the site he runs, pays people to use sockpuppets to push agendas, etc.
What an employee -
 who is employed as a news writer - does of their own volition is their own concern.
You are conflating the actions of one person (Jamie) with another (Roger). Jamie is not paid to sockpuppet, he is paid as a journalist. If he chooses to sockpuppet that is his own issue and anyone can rightly call him out on it, but equating it to Roger employing someone **as** a sockpuppet is ridiculous.
To use an analogy:
You work at a bookstore and the manager employs you as a teller to work the cash register. You are employed by him/her to do that job.
You take it upon yourself to write favourable reviews of some books and critical reviews of others. You are not employed to do that, but if we use the logic you are applying to this situation then the manager has employed you to write reviews.
They have not. They have employed you to work on the cash register, and you have taken it upon yourself to write the book reviews. You are an employee of the bookshop, but your actions in writing book reviews outside the scope of your cash register job are your own thing. They have nothing to do with the bookstore, and they have nothing to do with your manager. They are **your own** actions.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:00:11
Roger has addressed an employee's use of sockpuppetry here:


I'm not sure why you're stating that it is implausible for an employee of any company to act entirely of their own volition. Sure, the bookstore manager may prefer science-fiction books to horror books and may ask the cash register operator to write favourable reviews of science-fiction books, but without any indication that that is indeed the case then one situation is as *plausible* as another. My analogy stands on its own merits.

Well spotted, fren'. I do work with Bitcoin.com, yes, but does that make my comment or the points raised within it any less valid or logical? I believe the points I made stand on their own merit.
For what it's worth I'm completely against 'sockpuppets' whether the discussion is based around crypto or anything else as all they really do is skew the natural discussion of the topic at hand. Down with sockpuppets - up with valid, logical discussion!
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:10:33

You did not 'get kicked out' for saying the truth - you were removed for deleting other user's posts:
[Here's the Reddit post explaining why what you're saying is nonsense](
You also tried to ban a moderator on our forum after I had failed to remove the correct mod permissions because you just couldn't resist being petty and immature, and you also edited my post to try suit your narrative:
[The forum post detailing your childish behaviour can be found here](
Your behaviour is beyond absurd.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:50:10
Just reading through some of the posts here; Roger Ver had absolutely nothing to do with removal. I removed him for deleting user's posts and advised him of this in a site PM, the contents of which I am including below, and Roger was informed **after** this had occurred:












I have since restored the deleted user's posts. has stated that he deleted those posts accidentally, but when deleting a post on the Bitcoin.com forum you have to click a 'Delete post' button~~, and the site then asks if you're sure you want to delete that post~~.
~~Given that you are asked for confirmation, it's not an easy mistake to make. Perhaps it was an accident, perhaps it was not; if it *was* an accident then it demonstrates carelessness on the part of a moderator who might very easily delete other posts without intending to do so (and who would be removed as a result whether they're a big blocker, small blocker, or anything in between), and if it *was not* an accident then it demonstrates maliciousness and censorship on~~ a forum which **I** have the responsibility to ensure remains a platform on which free speech is protected.
This event, when added to previous actions such as stickying threads which voiced his sole opinion rather than a balanced view in order to "shout louder" than other users who did not have the same abilities to sticky threads, ultimately resulted in **my** decision to remove him as a moderator on the Bitcoin.com forum.
In comments here you and others have taken this issue as an opportunity to attack Roger for some strange reason, as though of the belief that the CEO of a fast-growing company micro-manages every aspect of that company, however your ire should be directed solely at me. I have responsibility for ensuring that freedom of speech is protected on the forum. Your freedom of speech is also protected there, and your moderator privileges being removed does not infringe on that freedom of speech in any way whatsoever; you are always welcome, and indeed encouraged, to post your opinions on the Bitcoin.com forum.
The 'strikethrough' content above is incorrect (there are some extra steps that can be taken to preserve other's posts when deleting an OP) and I apologise for that. I won't be ninja-editing my post in order to ensure full transparency.

Wow, trip down memory lane! Simpler times when ~333MH/s of USB powered incredibly hot mining hardware could earn you up to half a Dollar per day.
The block erupters were such a fun way to get involved with the actual network itself, helping to secure it in a very tiny way rather than just transacting on it. Originally cost ~0.99 BTC each if I recall correctly - a crystal ball to see into the future would have been a wise investment before I bought 5 of them!! :D
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:46:07
Hey I can definitely agree with the sentiment of your comment - $16 for 2 stickers is a very steep price for 2 pieces of sticky paper with graphics printed on them.
The reason for sometimes high prices on certain goods is because the Bitcoin Store is, similar to Bitcoin itself, decentralised to a large degree. Independent vendors can offer their wares on The Bitcoin Store if there is a demand for their products, or if they offer something unique and interesting (and after vetting to ensure legitimacy), and it in those cases it is those independent sellers who set the prices on their products.
We don't control the prices on those products at all, though in defence of the store I should note here that the more stickers someone buys the less they pay per sticker. However it *can* still be pretty pricey depending on the sticker (@ $42 for 25 of the stickers you mentioned) so I mention that mainly to offer balance rather than saying "hey, look at this great deal!".
That being said items like hoodies, t-shirts and mugs are generally very competitively priced, and indeed depending on where in the world a buyer is our hardware wallets can actually cost them less than buying directly from the manufacturer, with shorter shipping times to boot. :)
I'm certainly not saying that *some* products couldn't be priced more competitively, and due to individual seller's setting their own higher prices some are prohibitively expensive.
But we're big believers in the free market approach!
If the items are prohibitively expensive the seller won't make any / as many sales, and will likely drop their price as a result if they wish to sell their item. Alternatively another producer may come in offering the same (or better) quality goods at a lower price and buyers will spend their bitcoins with that seller instead. It's all about offering choice to both people who wish to spend their BTC and people who wish to sell their BTC / crypto related products. :)

I have used the Bitwala card extensively and it's fantastic! The majority of card loads go through in a matter of minutes (though sometimes if you load over the weekend you can be waiting until Monday and this can be a bit of a pain, although it's easily remedied by loading on a Thursday / Friday).
I've also tried cards from Bitnovo, Coinsbank, Cryptopay, Wirex and Xapo - every time I find myself returning to the Bitwala card whenever I need to spend Euro. Their fees are upfront and transparent and the BTC buy rate they offer (as you effectively sell your BTC when you load your card) generally seems to be more favourable than the other card services.
Bitwala and Wirex would be my two preferred services when it comes to holding funds in fiat, but Xapo is excellent if you prefer to hold your funds in BTC and convert only at the time you make a purchase. Again though, as you mentioned unless you possess the private keys to your BTC then the funds aren't really yours, so always be aware of that. Also a debit / prepaid card is like any other bank card so it's vulnerable to card skimming and card fraud, etc.
If funds are taken from a card at an ATM in Florida while the card itself is physically with you at home in Europe it's because the card was skimmed at home, most likely at an ATM when withdrawing cash. Just like with BTC, it's up to each and every one of us to safeguard our funds when using credit / debit cards - always give the ATM card slot a wiggle and a hard pull before putting your card into it to ensure that it doesn't have a skimmer installed, and **always** cover the keypad with your other hand when entering your PIN.
**Tl;dr** - I trust Bitwala (and their card) to the extent that the guys behind Bitwala have been in the Bitcoin game for a very long time, and have an excellent reputation. I do not trust Bitwala (or any other exchange / service) enough to keep a large amount of my funds. If I want to load my card I do so directly; as you don't have to first load your Bitwala wallet you can load the card directly from within the card load section.
