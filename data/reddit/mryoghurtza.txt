He left the BNP rather quickly. He was a member around 2004/2005. You'll be suprised to know he left. He's a short video explaining why:  I think he founded the EDL with good intentions. However he left the EDL too once he lost control of it effectively &amp; it too became racist like the BNP. I don't think being Pro England is far right. I'm not a Tommy expert so I don't know the finer details of the charges listed above. No doubt he has faults &amp; has made mistakes. However I think he's doing good work in highlighting big issues that politicians would rather sweep under the rug. Lastly the mortgage fraud seemed to be a minor technicality which invloved his brother in-laws home loan application. No need to call Interpol.

It's true he was a member of the BNP during 2004/2005. He sighted his reasons for leaving here:

I'm not going to repeat myself on the BNP &amp; EDL. Yeah I bet he's been violent at times. What matters are the issues he's highlighting. Do you need to be squeaky clean for your arguments or concerns to be valid? A little less going after his character &amp; a little more taking note of the issues raised.

I assume that you are referring to the most recent incident. In that case he was very careful not to divulge any info that wasn't already in the public domain. He was reporting on the day of the sentencing, the case had already been heard &amp; so he could not effect the outcome. In fact Tommys paid for training specifically on contempt of court law.

You dont know much about him clearly. I'd suggest that you watch his You Tube videos. You'll find them at odds with the main stream media. I've come across other examples but following Tommy online has really opened my eyes as to how manipulative the media can be.

Genuine question, what makes him fascist?

Tommy left the EDL 5+ years ago as he was concerned "with the dangers of far-right extremism". He admitted he should have left sooner.

I own some crypto currencies, I mine (GPU+ASIC) &amp; I follow Tommy. I can't say that I agree with you on your summary. You don't need to like me for my points to be valid.

Pretty much yeah. Pro freedom of speech as long as you agree with their positions on everything.
