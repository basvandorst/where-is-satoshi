This thread is blowing my mind.

I'd say it's quite likely that something like ZeroCoin gets implemented into Bitcoin sometime in the future. If/Once that happens Satoshi could easily spend the stash on whatever, without disclosing anything.

I really don't see how Google Authenticator (or OATH as the protocol is know as) support could be added to this. OATH relies on a shared secret between the authenticator and the authenticatee, which is used to generate the same OTP on both sides. Unless I've misunderstood how this extension works, there's no server to authenticate to, and the shared secret would have to be stored on the local machine, where it wouldn't actually add any real security to the system.

Your first example (crowdfunding) is actually solved already, without the need of any trusted oracle. In essence, you create an "anyone can pay" transation for the full amount, with the desired output(s). This means that inputs can be added, and each signature only covers the input itself. Anyone who wants to contribute adds an input to the transaction, and once the amount of Bitcoin on the input side matches the output, the transaction becomes valid and can be entered into the blockchain. Quite elegant, really. I believe this is what Lighthouse does (

You only need to generate unique values, it doesn't matter if anyone else generates the same ones (not that there is a very large likelihood of that). ECDSA can actually be made completely deterministic, see  . In fact, the Sigsafe PDF states that this value is calculated deterministically (section 8, attack vectors).
You do still need good randomness to generate the keys themselves, but requiring something that reads something external like atmospheric sound sounds like overkill.

If a pool finds a block A, it can get a head start on the next block by not immediately publishing the found block. The longer they hold block A secret, the longer they get to "pre-mine" the next block. However, there's always the chance that someone else finds a block B that gets accepted during this time, so it's a bit risky. If this happens, it might be in the selfish pools best interest to immediately release block A and hope that the network chooses it over block B. This might be why we're seeing orphaned blocks.

On the suggestion of I searched the bitcointalk forums, which led me to the following discussion: 
It touches on several of my concerns, but ultimately leads me to believe that the authors aren't open to fixing some fundamental underlying issues. I think I'm going to be avoiding BIP39 altogether, which leaves me without a good solution for a safe password protected paper backup of a BIP32 master key pair. Unfortunately BIP38 doesn't support BIP32 wallets (and isn't easily transcribable by hand). Maybe I should write a new BIP, eh?

Not sure if I misunderstood what you're saying here, but the keys in an EC key pair are NOT of equal length. A private key is a 256-bit integer (for the curve used by Bitcoin), and a public key is a point on the curve, consisting of two coordinates (x, y), where each coordinate is 256 bits (again, for this particular curve). A public key is thus twice as large as a private key.
However, since there can be at most two points on the curve for a given x-coordinate, you can represent a public key by using only the x-coordinate and the sign of the y-coordinate. This is what is known as "compressed form". Even when in compressed form the keys are not equal length.

To elaborate on the dangers of re-using of key pairs (which is never done with SQRL), this would link all (assuming a single key pair used everywhere) your accounts together. Most people might not want SMguy linked back to familyman in the case of a database leak, etc. Again, I'm aware that you can simply generate a new key for "embarrasing" sites, but why not just have that privacy built-in from the start?

Explained in detail with a picture here: 
Basically if two blocks are released at the same time, only one will become part of the block chain, and the other will become orphaned. This is why confirmations are important.
@_date: 2014-10-12 11:57:08
Thanks for the tip, I'll start by doing some digging over at bitcointalk.org to see if I can find anything relevant in existing discussions.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:01:47
Are YOU serious? I never said that it isn't possible to generate as many addresses as you want, I said that it makes no sense to re-use addresses for finance and ID. If there isn't going to be any overlap, why keep ID addresses and Bitcoin (as in storing value) addresses in the same "bag"? Why would I want to see my ID addresses when I'm looking at my wallet, and Bitcoin addresses when I'm logging in to a site?
I accept your apology, though I have doubts to its sincerity.

Adding the Blockheader once more into the innermost hash (currently containing N and S) should prevent any fiddling with the header without knowing S, unless I'm missing something.
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:57:56
To clarify on the actual point I was trying to make:
It may become possible to safely anonymize the coins, be it through a trustless mixer, or a side chain implementing something like ZeroCoin, or something completely different. This would allow Satoshi to safely spend the stash without risking his/her/their identity in the process. Yes, we would all be able to see that the coins were moved, but they would then be lost from the view of the public. Thus, while spending the stash now would likely risk outing Satoshi's identity, this might not be the case in the future.
@_date: 2014-10-12 12:17:07
Granted this is more of an issue with existing wallets/implementations of BIP39, not with the BIP itself: It seems that the general "work flow" is to generate a mnemonic on an offline computer, and transcribe it to paper. Then, to actually use it in a wallet you type in the mnemonic into the wallet software. As far as I can tell, this is the ONLY way to import an HD wallet into Mycelium (I realize this is a Mycelium issue, not BIP39) and I get the feeling that this is generally the way key import is done.
Maybe what I'm looking for isn't a way to fix BIP39, but rather a better proposal to work with key import of (BIP44) HD wallet accounts into wallet software. I get the feeling that BIP39 has kind of been shoehorned in to fill that gap, where it really doesn't fit.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:54:18
Right, but the same applies already to S. You could use any value for the innermost hash, but you won't be able to claim the reward. If you're out to destroy the reward though, you could just claim it and then burn it.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:57:32


Can you elaborate on that part?
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:45:25
Set in the not too distant future, goverments as we know them have pretty much collapsed. Out of the rubble new forms of high tech civilizations emerge, using new structures of algorithmic democracy. Unable to trust or rely on any central entity, decentralization is born out of nessecity. Influence is based on reputation, as assigned by others in response to actions. Help other people, and others will listen to your ideas.
These smaller societies are completely self-sustained, governed independently with different ideals. Some realizing the only way to survive in the long run is by preserving nature, staying carbon neutral by returning to older ways. Others do so by genetic manipulation, introducing modified crops which are more resistant and capable of providing more nutrients.
Meanwhile some governments have adapted to the new world and are working on ways to regain that lost control. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:16:16
Interesting! I'll have to give that a closer look.
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:37:59
Yeah, this seems like SQRL with the downside that it re-uses Bitcoin addresses. It makes very little sense to re-use a Bitcoin address for identification. Why would I want Bill's truck blog to know anything about my finances? Sure, I can create a new address that I use only for this, but then what's the point? Now I need to keep track of which of my addresses I use for Bitcoin and which I use for identity.
Edit: Another downside to this is that if I want to keep my identity somewhat private, I need to use a unique address for each site I sign up with. This is just automatic with something like SQRL.

Is this new mass-tipping trend a result of the "bits" denomination? Quite a lot in a name it seems!

Just thought I'd post an update:
I'm now on day 4 and I haven't missed a day so far. I received an e-mail with a link to a form to fill out the address I wanted the payment sent to 2 days ago, but I have yet to receive any payment (the first one should be paid after 2 days, if I'm not mistaken). I understand that there might be some delays in getting the payments out, and I hope the placebo team will update us on what's going on. I'll post another update when/if I receive any payment.

Same here, day 16, haven't missed any. Only got the initial 2.5 mBTC.
Edit: Got my 5mBTC as well!

This is the case for RSA, but NOT for EC (elliptic curve).
With RSA you get two functions, encrypt and decrypt, which are the inverse of each other (and are essentially the same mathematical operation). x = decrypt(encrypt(x)) = encrypt(decrypt(x)).
However, with EC you do not get this. There are no "encrypt" or "decrypt" primitives for EC. Instead you have to use the properties of EC together with other algorithms to do encryption and signing. For instance, ECDH (a variant of Diffie-Hellman which uses elliptic curve) can be used to derive a key which can then be used with AES (or other symmetric encryption) for encryption/decryption. ECDSA is commonly used for signing and signature verification.

I don't follow, I'm afraid. The proposal to introduce S is to kill pooled mining, as it cannot be done without trusting all peers (as the solver can "steal" the reward). You pointed out that untrusted pooled mining can still be done, as N doesn't need to be changed if the header is modified instead. Adding B to the inner hash means any change to the header requires S again. With or without B in the inner hash, the inner hash can be faked, with the result that the reward will be unspendable. A fake inner hash can be detected by anyone in the pool, but not someone outside who doesn't have access to S. However, as the whole point of the proposal is to kill pooled mining, it's kind of moot that anyone in the pool could attack the pool. Correct me if I've misinterpreted you or misunderstood something.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:15:10
Good read! Could you go into more details as to how the system uses multisig to make things more secure? How does BitGo approve withdrawals by users? Internal moving of funds by Bitstamp? In what type of scenario would BitGo prevent theft? That would be interesting to know!
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:30:50
Thanks for your input, but I sense a bit of hostility on your end (or perhaps arrogance, but I apologize for the accusation if none was intended). I didn't post this as an attack on the BIP per se, I was looking for clarification on some questions I had, which you and other have helped give. If you read my other comments in this thread you'll see that I've revised my opinion a bit and really only have a problem with the way BIP39 is used as a format for importing accounts (which is obviously not the fault of the BIP itself), and how the checksum verification is so easily overlookable.
Obviously I can modify BIP39 (or any other BIP) to suite my own needs, but real goal here is to be able to store multiple copies of an HD wallet in a format that could be understood by my heirs in case of my death, so only "standard" approaches are acceptable here.
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:16:38
Well, I suppose we disagree on that then. With all the recent hype around side-chains, I think it's a strong possibility that that gets added in some form, which is enough for anyone to then create a ZeroCoin (or similar) alt which is tied to the main blockchain.
@_date: 2014-10-13 07:55:56
Thanks for chiming in!
I hadn't initially realized how tied BIP39 was to the capabilities of the Trezor. With that in mind a lot of the design makes more sense.
