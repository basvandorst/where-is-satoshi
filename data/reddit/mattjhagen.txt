Does this only work for certain packages? I looked into this but when I went to checkout it only accepted debit or credit cards. No bitcoin option.

last year I purchased a BFL 5 GH/s BTC miner. I never made any money with it but I did gain a lot of good experience and understanding of how mining works. My suggestion? Hook it up for a few days and get comfortable with using pools, and monitoring your hashrate. If anything its a great experience.

looks like r/rbitcoin has a similar idea. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:13:46
You are correct. That is the fault of BTC and the blockchain. If someone were to hack into my account (given I have all my BTC in an online account and 2FA disabled) They could easily transfer all my coin out and before I could react the money would be gone. I may have the address it was sent to but I don't know that there really is any way for investigators to trace who the wallet belongs to. This is what happened at MTGOX and guess how that went? Although on the other hand there is a lot of wallets requiring that you verify your identity before you use that service, so maybe there is or will be a way to trace addresses in the future. On the flip side if you are the crook, maybe consider changing your career choice and don't do anything illegal (anonymous as you may feel) it may all come back to bite you one day.

I agree, in fact the website even lists it as a minimum system requirement: 
Bitcoin Core full nodes have certain requirements. If you try running a node on weak hardware, it may work—but you’ll likely spend more time dealing with issues. If you can meet the following requirements, you’ll have an easy-to-use node.
* Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
* 50 gigabytes of free disk space
* &gt;**2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)**
* A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second

Man I feel right now banks are either ignoring the bitcoin market or are trying to lie to customers and tell them its not a good market to invest in and/or even going as far as suspending peoples accounts that do try to use bitcoin. Like you said if banks don't embrace bitcoin they will be left in the dust (just like blockbuster didn't embrace online sales.) more and more banks are moving away from physical locations and towards online only banking (Ally, CapitalOne360, Simple, etc...). It will be very interesting in the years to come see how these big corporate giants embrace the bitcoin network, news flash its here to stay.
Be prepared for some deception in banks. If they aren't for it they will be starting to take measures towards keeping there loyal customer base and away from blockchain technologies in the coming months.
I don't see bitcoin leaving any time soon Just like I didn't see email becoming a niche market.

There is always that risk with a BTC loan. I suppose there may have been defaults. There is also an option to refinance your loan (pretty much the same listing process) and it will give you more time to pay and with new investors. Kinda like loan consolidation.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:56:34
Yes and No. A lot of wallet services change your wallet address every few hours or every few transactions. So unless you decide to use the same wallet address for every transaction it would be difficult to attach a sequence of events to one address over the span of years or even months. Now, if you give investigators rights to your wallet and they can somehow see every address ever used, then yes there is a possibility.

I hope you have a secure offline place for your coins? If not now is an opportune time to purchase one.
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:47:24
Yes you can have them tied to USD as well (among a few other fiat currencies)
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:01:54
you can use Coinbase (I do) you can also use Circle. They both work great, Circle is a little more expensive but they offer the choice of purchasing directly with a debit or credit card (be aware credit card companies like to charge a cash advance fee if you do). I use both because both my accounts are relatively low and I have a small buy limit.

I linked every possible account under the sun. Have near 100% eBay feedback, regular income, all the essentials, yet they only gave me a C. So don't worry it'll come with time and trust.

Few questions:
Do you see P2P lending becoming the norm and banks slowly phasing out within the next 5 years, decade, etc...?
I know decentralization is a huge threat to bank as is - less profit if fewer customers. Do you feel there will be a standard or a trust when it comes to P2P lending? Banks now have (at least in the US) FDIC insured accounts. This is a format that either banks can choose to adopt or not. People feel good when they know there banking is insured (even if it is by the US government "haha, power of deception right"). Anyways back to my Q, do you think there will be a universal standard or code when it comes to P2P lending or BTC banking in general when it comes to holding securities outside your own personal wallet?
And last question. Have you used any services like bitlendingclub or another P2P loan platforms? How do they differ? and what are the pros and cons of such?

Think of Coinbase as a bank - you can store your bitcoin and even exchange your fiat for BTC and vise versa.
Think of Coinbase Exchange like a brokerage account - you can use this to set market or limit orders and buy or sell at the price you choose (not the price coinbase gives at the time of the transaction)

I understand your point and have given this some thought. I am sure the company also has some miners set aside for their own profit above what they already make from the contracts. BUT, any company would need a little capital to purchase these machines and electricity to run the networks. Thats where we come in, we give them some money that they can use to buy and maintain new miners and then sell more contracts to customers.

Try Bitwallet. I have been looking for one for a long time and finally found this one. It syncs every 10, 15, 30 minutes. Has customizable themes, TouchID support, and its free! Oh and push notifications, you can add (i believe) up to 15 addresses to watch and import private keys to send if you want. Others i have tried were obviously blockchain and baseline.
If you are looking for just a summary of what a wallet has in it you can get BitScanner. It costs like 2 bucks but its worth every penny.

I am not sure (honestly I'm more a software than hardware guy) but I'm sure you can google and there would be some resources. If you look on this article there is minimum system requirements. I saw if you can get Ubuntu on your pi with some memory and a display port you should have no problem installing the node software and contributing. Note the Blockchain is pretty big so I would suggest at least 100GB hard drive.
