Oh come on, dont get defensive and wrapped into an "my idea vs your idea" vortex of irrationality. From my point of view the ideas he is putting forward are very worth consideration and make a whole lot of sense. Come on guys, collaborate - dont compete!

Wow, a tldr bot. What a time to be alive.
Secondly - providing tax benefits to people who own miners would be a great second option once we hit the coin cap

It wouldnt be too hard, google as an open optical character recognition api, you could code a mini app yourself, idk the security implications

I agree with this. Turning bitcoin into a payment network does little more than provide an alternative technology to ACH. What is the point of that? The real value and innovation of btc is in its store of value and encryption technology. Coinbase can take a long jump off a steep cliff.

Really, really bad: Which is to say that a business as usual financial firm wants to water down bitcoin into a shitty version of a prepaid visa card. Heres an idea for any coinbase pple: create your own altcoin focused on scaling small transactions and leave the bitcoin network alone. Of course that probably works against the interests your of investors who dont want to see any real competitor to the store of value services banks provide. But its cool all us btc people are just snakes following the piper, just play a different tune im sure we'll all follow! Right guys??
