I can agree to a certain extent but how many like him have you seen backing bitcoin so far ��
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:23:20
What could be a 3rd layer built on Bitcoin network to scale further? LN is just at the beginning but I am sure on long run this won’t be enough either. 
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:07:00
I wasn’t referring to the 2nd layer.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:50:23
I wonder why they don’t do anything about it
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:30:51
It was awful..they would claim network is congested and settle the transaction days later..happened to me a lot of times on shapeshift and once on changelly. Changelly, cut the losses with me on a $ETC transaction so I believe they really had that issue. But i never touched any of them since then lol

Btw, to answer your question no, it belongs to one of our writers ☺️ also, I don’t spam. Well, couple of days ago I did posted 3 links..my honest mistake. I didn’t go through rules properly. Besides, any article I share it’s original, ads free, as we don’t serve ads (I personally hate them) and content is good I think :D
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:20:28
Unfortunately it’s the best option you have to buy bitcoin in many countries...but i agree with you. Luno is also a good solution but not everywhere
@_date: 2019-11-15 10:33:36
Good evening Bitcoiners!!! Let’s make Bitcoin great together! Wear a Bitcoin t-shirt whenever you have the chance!!
@_date: 2019-11-10 09:50:34
Wow �� 44.2 he’ll never have the student loan problems now! Good for him!
@_date: 2019-11-03 21:09:54
We should care ☺️ these are baby steps towards achieving Satoshi’s vision
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:50:13
We need to wait the day they will finally embrace bitcoin and work with/on it ��
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:50:40
Bitcoin discounted guys!!!
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:19:51
Sad day for porn....but yeah..btc looks bearish af
The price of BTC/USD is being pressured beneath $8.88k. There is a likelihood of the price declining following a move below two supports at $8.64k and $8.6k.
On November 13, the price of BTC/USD took on a selling pattern beneath the $8.88k resistance. It is still in the selling area beneath $8.8k, as well as the 100 hourly SMA. It was rejected close to $8.78k and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It was able to form a high close to $8,784 prior to its move beneath $8.7k. Further, it went beneath $8.68k and now around the $8.64k support zone.

Not the slightest intention �� I think I added that image myself as it fit with the topic
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:38:34
Some links please to see what is capable of and how bitcoin network can benefit from. Thank
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:01:01
Oh yeah!!! I have never thought this could be a good buy signal ��
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:11:41
I wonder who’s fault is ��
@_date: 2019-11-08 13:44:36
Well I don’t think it’s possible to ban BTC ������
@_date: 2019-11-03 21:26:53
I get you man..but it’s an important part of our society...plus we get more and more of those���� not sure if they will ever stop, at least we have something for BTC as well. It will increase adoption eventually
@_date: 2019-11-07 21:51:11
Hope the legislation won’t include torture ��
@_date: 2019-11-10 09:47:58
I am not able to join chats guys. Why?
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:13:40
Yeah, Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Cash nor Bitcoin SV
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:45:42
Winter is coming!! Will we have a good crypto winter this year:D?
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:23:27
This is actually may be the hard truth lol
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:55:31
Bitcoin baby ❤️��
@_date: 2019-11-05 08:19:38
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:36:38
Hard to say in my opinion, unless people will start using it..we need mass adoption and states to embrace it. 
Imagine doing business in Bitcoin instead of $ ☺️ maybe then
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:34:45
I use luno and revolut. 6h for a transaction..max 24h
@_date: 2019-11-05 20:30:35
I wonder if that gold guy Peter Schiff voted too.
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:04:27
Why is it spam?
@_date: 2019-11-13 10:37:24
That’s a very irresponsible thing to do. Investing more than you can afford has most of the times proven to be a bad thing....
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:23:08
Nope I think it was this —&gt; 
Abiut moon and the browser extension.
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:53:35
Buy Bitcoin, short the bankers!!
@_date: 2019-11-13 07:29:09
A lot of people have started predicting about Bitcoin’s price following its halving. Do you think it will have any real effect on the price? Few days ago the hashrate  dropped a lot
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:18:05
The news is pretty new though. It links to a different old article ofc. But do you think that they will not use it and they just buy them to prevent abuse? I mean few weeks ago there was a news about a company (forgot its name) that made purchases through crypto on Amazon possible . I do think(hope) giants like them will finally be dragged into this game.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:31:43
we are still learning about Bitcoin ourselves, imagine him ��
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:27:36
Is this revolut? ����
@_date: 2019-11-04 08:23:38
Which one lol? I may need to ask to change the pics
@_date: 2019-11-12 04:59:28
 ��
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:02:27
What spam account? No, we have another website but we don’t post here. I don’t think posts fit..they are opinion based and reviews not fully bitcoin oriented. 
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:26:24
True + a lot of greed...And they kill us with taxes which we have to pay just because of their incompetence
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:37:30
Absolutely not..Ethereum is �� can’t beat BTC.but the investors will look for alternatives that’s for sure
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:00:16
Keep up the good work!! Ignore the people attacking you. Most of them have nothing better to do.
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:25:34
Nope, actually it was backed by my Bitcoin from my mobile wallet :D
@_date: 2019-11-04 08:41:15
Wow this was very well spotted ����
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:49:35
Oh well...luckyyyyyyy
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:26:17
Indeed. You just install it and pay with cryptos. I think it’s supported on few browsers though
@_date: 2019-11-06 12:58:59
Been dreaming about those Chinese money myself too��
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:12:55
Wtf is happening with the markets ��
@_date: 2019-11-05 08:18:39
Yesssss!!! That’s the spirit! Congratulations on purchasing the Bitcoin! This is how is done!
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:55:46
I wonder if there’s still profit for home miners with very little technology to mine btc...hmhm At some point i kept hearing about coinmine or something but everything seem silent about them.. I also heard about some 1 click installers, wondering if these ever worked
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:39:13
Long love bitcoin ��

Every Satoshi matters!!! Thank you so much ☺️
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:24:56
We are the pioneers bro! I fully agree with you but think about the internet in its early years...back in 95 no one (the masses) understood it... and now 5.4bn people are digitally connected :) so welcome to the future!
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:36:17
Fingered crossed ��
@_date: 2019-12-23 11:04:29
History books will talk about our generation! Thank you, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:57:08
I read an article recently about this. Someone was saying that btc dominance will be 85% next year. Nice
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:29:44
Dude...what a bloodbath
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:22:54
Lol I also saw the same thing when I visited the sub! 11k nice! All good! Looking forward to the halving! I really want to see the impact it will have! I mean I hope it won’t be Litecoin like�� however many people say it the price won’t be impacted!
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:36:31
It’s not an experiment, it’s actual truth. The main reason behind: because 99% of “investors” can’t afford a whole bunch of bitcoins and they lack proper education. So they would rather say, let me buy 10k of this shitcoin instead of 1000 sats or whatever they afford to invest; hoping that one day will pump when in reality most probably they will end up losing that money too. Been there done that - l rarely go under 75% BTC ratio now.
@_date: 2019-12-24 09:16:18
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:53:35
Time will tell :D only 5 months away so we will see. I also think it might not have an effect on the price at the beginning but since the competition will be even harder to get those btc maybe it will skyrocket at some point..who knows
@_date: 2019-12-27 09:24:58
Just 
@_date: 2019-12-23 11:03:57
Jezz �� I thought the panic selling era was long gone
@_date: 2019-12-22 09:39:02
Right, i was thinking about the cold wallets my mistake even in the article says it����
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:11:46
Merry Christmas �� Bitcoin still rocking!
@_date: 2019-12-12 13:50:59
Bring it on!!!
@_date: 2019-12-29 08:20:52
������ spot on
@_date: 2019-12-27 09:24:38
Don’t panic on the upcoming price dump! Just 
@_date: 2019-12-22 08:19:39
I think it’s falling under HW cause it’s also paper. Here’s an article on this: 
Edit: Falling under Cold Wallets, not Hardware Wallets.

Reducing the amount of cash is happening everywhere but rest assured cash can be easily traced
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:13:32
Awesome! I am thinking to start a business with just that in the near future ��
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:48:02
Any legit mining sites I could use?

Not familiar with CashApp. Bot available in mu country but are you allowed to withdraw to any offset wallets?
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:57:16
 was the  year! I think we are going to see a lot of projects dying and some new big players in the business too.
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:32:24
Try that with Bitcoin ��������

You might wanna use bank transfer in this case..not sure if there’s any company offering less than 3%..
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:31:02
Bitcoin will never die!!!
