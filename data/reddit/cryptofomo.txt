why would 4mb blocks be less safe than 1mb blocks? What’s so magic about 1mb?
And if the argument is that contentious hard forks aren’t ‘safe’  - then we might as well give up on BTC now, because it’s way too easy for a vocal minority (whether thru vested interest or ideological ignorance) to create contention.
Thanks for the tip.

The real question is ‘when should BTC have bigger blocks?’

You’re not protected by government funded police, military, intelligence agencies? You never use public transport? You don’t rely on public sanitisation services? Your employer doesn’t use any public infrastructure or receive any government  subsidies to help it operate and stay in business? You don’t use any technology or scientific knowledge that was developed in whole or part from publicly funded research? And your certain that neither you nor anyone you care about will ever need any government assistance to survive? What island do you live on?

Who said governments are ‘magical’? I was just pointing out that taxes pay for a lot more than ‘public roadways’.. There may be other ways to fund public goods and services- but let’s not pretend we don’t all benefit from the many things that taxes currently pay for.
BTW the ‘paywall’ on scientific knowledge is because of the private publishing industry. One solution is publicly funded libraries (which use public money to pay for journal subscriptions- so anyone can read articles for free), another solution is open access journals...where publicly funded researchers are mandated to use some of that public funding to pay for their articles to be freely available once they are published.

At some point everyone will spend some of their bitcoin- to buy stuff they need or want (same reason they sell any investment).  There has been a lot of discussion about this in relation to Bitcoin - see this [example](

They’re not mutually exclusive. If bitcoin becomes widely adopted it’s price has to increase - because the supply is limited. That is the only reason bitcoin is potentially a good investment- it’s useful and it’s scarce. If it’s not used - because its too slow or expensive to use- it becomes worthless. If you want lambos, encourage adoption (spend and replace).

just in case humans don’t fuck it up (like they fuck up 99% of good ideas through hubris, arrogance, greed and power trips) . If Bitcoin achieves its potential, its limited supply guarantees huge price increases.

No serious investor would consider bitcoin a ‘safe haven’ - it’s extremely volatile and still experimental (especially as a ‘store of value’). It may be relatively ‘safe’ for a  Venezuelan (assuming they can afford the fees), but not anyone else.
Speculators use money they can afford to lose - and as the stock market collapses people will have less money to risk.

You want the ‘store of value’ coin to lose 90% of its value?

Down 40% in a month != steady

Alts will rise again when BTC transactions get too slow and expensive.
Edit: Your downvotes don’t change the fact that by limiting the network’s transaction capacity BTC has created a market for alternative forms of peer-to-peer electronic cash. If you want to kill alts, make BTC useful again with a modest increase in block size. It will have to be raised eventually anyway- even Lightning devs acknowledge that. Why not do it now and avoid the next bottleneck that sends everyone to alts?
