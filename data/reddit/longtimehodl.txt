The news articles you find online are likely similar to ones you will find in a newspaper, if not the same. If i read something about sports or an event in a newspaper, it's not like going to get a conflicting report online unless its an opinionated piece. I already explained about eye strain from reading from a screen vs paper and the fact i get them for free as well so there is plenty of common sense.
Honesty, have you ever read a newspaper before? You might find it a refreshing change from staring at blue light.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:06:10
It's just the news, its no more "depressing", "brainwashed" than anything else you'll find online. I like reading about recent events, opinions and sometimes finding suprise interesting subjects outside of my normal circle of topics. 
I'm curious as to what age group you sit in. I'm only in my late 20s so i find your attitude to papers a bit weird.

Gambling is illegal in china, so people turn to investments, stocks and currency exchange to substitute gambling, which includes buying and selling bitcoin. I'm afraid It really is that simple otherwise china would have outright banned bitcoin by now.
Even in hong kong, every day people talk about currency rates, people selling newspapers sit with laptops just watching stock prices.

I get a free newspaper on my way to work, i probably wouldn't bother buying one otherwise but yes, i like reading newspapers, better than reading online articles.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:40:44
I assume its still profitable, personally i prefer to read by paper rather than on a screen. Less strain on my eyes.

You didn't read what i wrote, to ask also means you don't know what the answer is going to be, so really you're using ask in a very relaxed context when in fact you are actually telling someone your situation.
like asking if you can use the bathroom when you're in someone else's house, you're not really asking for permission per se, you're telling them you need directions to the toilet in a polite manner. Same with borrowing money, if you know the answer, then you are simply explaining the situation. If the answer is no, then you don't know your friend well enough either due to lack of trust or lack of awareness of your friend's own financial situation.

It's a chinese saying, obviously it's too complicated for westerners

@_date: 2018-08-19 08:44:20
This is a chinese saying, if you have a friend who needs money, you'd offer the money. 
If it comes to the point where you need to ask for money then you either aren't trust worthy enough already or have a bad friend.
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:42:37
It's actually quite deceptively clever, maybe it doesn't translate very well but if you need to ask it means you don't know the answer, if you don't know the answer, you don't know your friend well enough and if you know your friend will lend you the money then you are actually telling them you need money and they are simply obliging. Therefore a true friend never asks for money.
If they say no, you risk losing a friend as well.
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:00:53
Nah mate, more like the saying goes over a lot of people's heads, you too as well.

45%? Try 90%
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:11:44
But would you wait till they asked you for the money or would you offer it once you knew this friend was in trouble? 
That's why a true friend would never have to ask for money, because you'd have offered the money in first place rather wait for them to come grovelling for money. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 08:26:18
A true friend never asks another friend for money
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:05:52
That's kinda the point of what i wrote; a true friend wouldn't wait till you asked and if you had to ask then it's questionable how much of a true friend you really had.
 It's a chinese saying which is going over a lot of people's heads, perhaps i worded it improperly but people are quick to hate.

Lol wtf, you're the one who implied that it is indeed difficult to see the difference between asians until you had to look one in the face.
So i'm racist because i'm pointing out your inconsistencies. Good job.

You mean to tell me economic immigrants who travel half the world to come to america tend work harder to better themselves? 
No shit sherlock. If you had stats on recent european and african immigrants you'd also notice these groups do very well compared to american counterparts but like an idiot you prefer to blanket races.
Statistics means nothing without any logical thinking. Again, you haven't told me what exactly are those special advantages asians have over white and other ethnicities. Work ethic and studying isn't exactly a racial advantage.
I'm sure you can enlighten me those numerous advantages. In the mean time you can sit in a corner and bitch about jews or something.
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:02:32
At best you are explaining a general phenomenon of face blurring which your brain does automatically because you don't need to know so many faces. If you remember seeing a group of bold white strangers, your memories would blur their faces because you don't have a name to those faces.
What you did was try and put legitamacy in a racist joke by implying only asians look the same using, quite frankly, pseudo science.
Having been on the recieving end of such jokes irl , i take your comments as rather personal and extremely naive.
@_date: 2019-03-25 06:40:16
You figured all that out on your own after i told you i was asian?
Well done sherlock. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:01:06
I forgot every asian is a doctor or an accountant in america, working class and poor asians don't exist, must be latinos working those asian restaurants.
Better advantages than whites like... affirmative action? Oh yeah because Asians have that secret sly advantage of studying, they never had to work at getting those jobs because of those none existent connections they have.
I'm not american either, swing and a miss.
@_date: 2019-03-24 08:56:07
Who are you working for if not chinese in china? Lol
Nah, i just can't stand bullshit explanations when you actually thought asians all look the same. Like watching some idiot trying to explain that black people have low iq.

Is that for tax write off purposes or something?
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:37:07
That's not a conspiracy, its common sense. The only people qualified to write tax laws and work with governments are accountants who understand the laws. 
That's not to say they leave tax loops deliberately but if anyone was going to search deep enough for one or figure it out, it'd likely be accountants who worked and helped with those rules. 
This is common in all works of proffessions. If you wanted planning permission to build something, chances are a good consultant would have worked in the planning department.

Well constructed freedom, rightly or wrongly, there are only certain degrees to that freedom which is all structured.
Politically, the choices of main parties never really stray too far from one another, so who governs doesn't really make a huge differerence. 
"free" journalism is generally predictable and rarely unbiased to the point of social conditioning.

Yep, the people who make tax rules are accountants who eventually get hired by firms to find tax loopholes so there's essentially a never ending cycle.

Yep, a lot of takeaways do this because they work on thin margins, i know some managers/owners who signed up to food apps like just eat, just to find that they've made little gain despite a big increase of customers because they enter a higher tax band and can't fudge the numbers. The more successful ones take multiple holidays just to prevent going over certain vat limits.
So yeah, you make it more convienient and gain more customers but make little extra money from it and have to hire more staff and work like crazy for it.
@_date: 2019-08-18 07:18:54
I'm not even convinced they were trying to exert more control. They've had unconditional majority control of govenment since the handover and hk served its purpose as being an international finance hub.
Hk has been economically and socially stagnant for the past 2 decades, reaching a peak in the 90s, imo the democracy movement was looking for an opportunity to pounce on anything, the extradition treaty was more about taiwan than anything else because hk and mainland already have an extradition agreement (would be insane to think they didn't set one up before the handover).

Considering how well the syrian "revolution" is going which the west also loved to support, i would err on the side of caution. As romantic as being a freedom fighter sounds, the reality is it rarely ever works unless the government in power is collapsing.
I also don't believe in media swirl stories either to sway my opinion and call it as i see it, and quite frankly hk is china's property, like it or not. 
Currently, hk still has all previous rights which imo isn't likely to change any time soon, even the extradition bill wouldn't have stripped rights.
Democracy is never given unless you believe it works in your favour, so why would china give universal sufferage to people burning their flags?
Cowardly? You and i are not hkers, i'm merely looking at this from a non biased, realistic perspective.

I agree with your second point but i don't see how its more expensive to accept cash than card, the only problem is keeping change and cash reciepts, big companies might have to pay extra for someone to do that but for small businesses, the manager/owner will do that himself.

Not really, not protesting due to the threat of being jailed isn't really a chinese thing, most chinese aren't willing to protest as long as they can make money and live their lives, which pretty much all of them can if they don't shake the system. I mean chinese citizens have had their lives improved dramatically in the last 3 decades, so why would they be protesting? You do know chairman mao's been dead for some time right?
