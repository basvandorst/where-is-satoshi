There is also coinapult for sending btc to e-mail addresses. I just gave 0.1btc to louis ck, and 0.1 to the creators of diskinventoryx today.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:02:26
yes, it can. you should keep your coins outside of any exchange, unless you want to trade actively, or it's a spare change.
keep in mind that it takes 1-3 hours to get your money from an outside wallet into mtgox, so you won't be able to sell if something drastic happens
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:45:14
I sold my ~1k coins at different points of the fall from $250, getting $150k off them.
I then wired $40k away from MtGox, spent $70k to rebuy the $1k coins, and kept $40k in MtGox with an open order to rebuy around $25. If they happen to ever fall below $15, I'm wiring my money back to MtGox and rebuying even more.
I believe that BTC fundamentals are strong, and we'll reach $1k/coin within the next five years. But it's quite possible that we'll hit a bear market, and have a price of $50, or even far below, for the next year or so. But I'm fine with that.
I'm fine with that, because what's the alternative? I invest in something "safe" like a flat, or government bonds? That won't bring me a financial independence, and won't affect my lifestyle that much, aside from a little bit more of a safety cushion.
In five years it won't really matter whether I get out of the whole BTC with $30k (after taxes), or with $150k. But if BTC happens to raise to a $1000/coin... Well, with $1M on my account, I'll be financially independent for life. I'm willing to gamble on this.
tl;dr; holding 1kBTC until it reaches $1k/coin. If it reaches $25/coin in the meantime, I'll be buying even more. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:52:50
but the solution is not to raise price of btc until 1000btc costs a billion, but to encourage more people to sell. and guess what makes people stop selling - an announcement of a billion having a chance to be put into the market.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:19:53
International transfers to MtGox take ~3 days from my country, and seem much more reliable. Assuming you want to transfer &gt;$1k, below that the fees won't be so good.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:40:15
I'm glad somebody noticed, it seems to have drowned in the sea of other posts :/
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:32:31
That's my story. I bought 1.2kBTC back when they were worth USD5 a year ago. Last monday was quite fun for me, I had a live trading preview opened up for a couple hours, just watching and thinking what to do.
At the end, I decided to sell 0.5kBTC @ 139USD, which gave me ~70k. Thanks to this I'm all set (could buy a flat in my country). If BTC goes all the way to 300-600USD, I'll still earn a fucklot, holding 0.7k BTC, and if it happens to crash down to $30 again, It will hurt, but not as much.
Now, dumping 70k from MTgox, nobody noticed. But the issue is how I bring that 70k from MTgox to my bank account. I already spoke to my tax advisor, and he's working on this part. The easiest scenario, I'd have to pay 30% income tax. But I'll be looking forward to some other way of cashing out (e.g. re-buying coins and selling them otc, or travelling to that ATM machine they're setting up in LA :) ).
The taxes, btw. may be a reason btc-millionaires won't be too inclined to withdraw the funds. If you're to lose 30% of your funds upon withdrawal, it may be better to leave it in the economy and reinvest it there, withdrawing only some small sums as needed.
BTW - it was a lots of fun to explain the whole btc to my tax advisor. "I've got a funny problem, last month I earned 170k speculating using a funny internet currency, how do I tax it now?"
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:33:13
when I asked around, people were saying that's because it's harder (more expensive) to get money into btc-e.
I was watching the prices at btc-e for a while now, and they're always below mtgox..
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:39:13
internets! brilliant!
@_date: 2013-08-17 22:35:37
insanely? nope. but I bought 2k BTC @ $5 each, sold a half in December, for $10 each, and right now, after a lot of buying&amp;selling in April, still have 1k BTC &amp; around $60k in cash.
Of course, I regret selling for $10, and not selling at $250. But I believe BTC will be worth far more than $1000 in a couple years, and this is the best investment right now.
Btw. back in April, there was a guy on who was throwing random $300-$5k bitcointips left and right. Oh, fun times.

It's a backdoor within the software, not within the OS, or computer.
The simplest form of attack could go like this:
- I go and take the source for one of the common wallet generators
- It has a random seed or something, for the key generation.
- I change the source, and modify the random seed to be semi-random (e.g. be only from the range of 1-100.000).
- I install it on the victim's offline computer / put up a fake "mirror" website for the client
The software works as advertised, it generates a different key each time, on each computer. It's undestinguishable from the regular one, unless one looks at the source code.
But I now have a list of just couple million possible wallet keys, and I monitor the blockchain for those.
In other words - the computer being permanently offline won't protect you from a backdoor in the software.

Halving days do not influence any IT system outside of the miners. And they built into the protocol from the start.
Anyway, this is not a discussion. I'm simply explaining to you why this scenario is not happening. And why you're getting downvoted by people other than me. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:27:18
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:02:16
the followup is that I sold some more (120) @ 240, when they began to fall, and even more (180) @ 140, the same day. Later on (today) I sold even more (250) @ 80, and I'm now buying back those 250 @ 110 :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:04:04
i'll say it again here - running it locally won't protect the users. what protects the users is that the source is vetted by the community.
you go on telling people that offline=secure and someone will lose coins due to a scammer forking your source and introducing a hole into the app.
and people will be saying "well, I thought it was secure, thepapers said that running it offline will ensure nothing is being transferred elsewhere."
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:51:14
fun fact - I just lost $15k by re-buying @ 105.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:22:02

Yeah. It's a throwaway unfortunately :)

one more thing... when I was in high school, I loved this quote..
*"Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat."*
Well, last month I had to decide whether I really believe it :)
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:09:17
thanks. it was an honest mistake. it's quite late over here.

They show where it all was moments ago.
@_date: 2013-04-18 10:42:31
Please google them up. There is a harsh critique of this project - I'd call them scammers.
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:06:26
if the software is compromised, running it on an offline computer is not enough.
bitaddress.org is probably fine, but not because it runs offline, for the fuck's sake.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:13:57
I guess you're right :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:35:57

I'm not asking from the perspective of the user, but from a perspective of the vendor. I have a site, I want to add bitcoin "subscriptions", what kind of qr code do I generate?
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:51:34
I'm not negative towards everything. I'm just negative towards this idea :) 
There are far better solutions for exactly the same problems, and those solutions don't require the refactoring of hundreds(thousands) of apps dealing with bitcoin, and don't possess such high risks.
But you're right, I should've been less aggressive towards you, I apologize.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:31:02
Well, I only told a part of the story, to be frank. The 1.2kBTC was just a leftover. I really originally bought ~2.4kBTC at the USD5, but sold a half of it when the price got to $10.
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:24:08
did you call your bank and ask about the wire transfer? perhaps it got stuck on your side - i've seen this happen

How many foreign languages do *you* speak? How is your grammar with them?
And - as far as I remember, I was not complaining about this project per se, but about you claiming that offline means secure. It doesn't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:42:06
no, it won't. even a locally generated wallet can be insecure
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:23:18
Well, just wait, and you still may have a chance ;)
My friends laughed at me when I said I want to invest a couple months' of pay into $5 bitcoin, because 50Million market valuation is too low in my opinion...
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:41:43
well, let's not forget, that quite a few people use Coinbase, and MtGox to keep their coins. Friends I've sent the coins to, opted to keep them at MtGox.
As far as I understand if you use MtGox, your money lands in a shared account/cold storage, and doesn't count into the limit.
What somebody should do is discover the address of MtGox's cold storage (shouldn't be hard - just track where the coins ultimately land), and track how many people sent their money there.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:36:08
Well, judging by today's charts the delay benefitted you :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:17:12
I just coinapulted 0.1BTC to him ( support ). Perhaps this will do it :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 10:57:00
fuck you too.
I'm talking about a theoretical scenario which is quite possible. People should not trust bitcoin wallets just because a wallet is offline. They should trust only the ones that are vested by community, with a thoroughly checked source code.
If you're holding 1btc it doesn't matter that much, but if I see a guy bragging about his top notch security for his 500btc, and he thinks that an offline generated paper wallet is automatically secure... he's up for a surprise
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:16:56
With all the sympathy for BTC, this article has a lot of crap, and wishful thinking.
"Their currency had several billion yuan of sales per year " - well, that is several hundred million dollars. This is how big the BTC economy is right now, and probably 10% of what it will be in 1-2 years.
So, the Chinese virtual currency at its peak was significantly weaker than BTC can be outside of china.
"Chinese people are already used to the concept of mining coins"
I almost burst out laughing.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:42:57
ok, so if I'm a vendor, how do I explain this to people? (honest question)
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:30:31
well, in case of a client-side system, the security is improved, because the attackers would have the access to the doftware anyway.
for server side systems it's not thst good. one zero-day exploit and all the money on all the exchanges is gone.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:16:32
There is also:
7: MtGox collapsing and taking funds of thousands of people with them. This might kill the traction of btc and similar currencies forever...
8: Unregulated money printing leading to the oversupply of btc. Imagine a bitcoin bank printing out bitcoins just the way traditional banks print out dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:15:18
It's not about just miners. E.g. the whole code of mtgox, and any other exchange/walled, would have to be carefully inspected for this. One mistake one place, and the site goes bankrupt.
If it was just miners, it would be far easier.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:33:42
being run from a private offline computer still doesn't protect you by itself
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:05:44
that's great to hear, thanks. if you have any say in the manner, it would be nice if you guys didn't look at just mtgox - like the others said in this thread.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:18:55
Oh, ok :)
You seem like a very reasonable person. Good luck with everything. You might set up a small consulting thing, or sth. Set up a small website, describe your services + your phone number. You probably live in a bigger city (because you work in a financial firm), so it shouldn't be that hard to meet potential clients.
Also, if you're in US, you can go to meetup.com, find finance meetups around, and go there. Talk to people there, and in no time they will be paying you to set up wallets/security/etc.
With the amount of publicity bitcoin is getting now, you stand a chance to build a career out of it. Don't waste it!
PM me if you'd like a small investment to get off the ground. No promises! :)
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:20:03
Hahah, sure :) Thx.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:19:16
do you believe in fundamentals of btc as a currency, or did you buy because it rose in value?
it will probably get back... it may take a year or five now, though.

Donate some bitcoins to various organizations which don't accept bitcoins yet by catapulting them (coinapult), or sending via coinbase. If you manage to catapult 10BTC in 0.1 chunks, some receipients may start accepting them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:43:41
What I meant was that the hashing function can be compromised, and generate only, say 1 million, possible private keys.
The attacker would watch all the million possible addresses generated by the app, with no communication with the computer necessary.
It would also be hard to verify the trustworthiness of the app, aside from comparing the generated key with an output of another app, or deeply inspecting the source. A small "bug" within the hashing function could significantly lower the amount of possible outputs.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:49:05
well, I don't want to trash you too much, but no money is no excuse for not owning a computer. you could explain your situation on a craigslist, and get a used laptop, or a stationary pc within a week if you wanted to.
or ask friends around. or look at a junkyard, or whatever. 
as for paying bills, I feel your pain. on the other hand, you have a knowledge of the btc market, if I were you, I'd spend the next week looking for consulting gigs in the area. there are a plenty of people who need help with security, setting up wallets, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:27:07
I'm in Europe. But I probably won't buy a flat - the ROI is quite lousy. 
What I plan to do is keep the most of it in some safe place with 5% annual profit, and use the remaining 10-20% for more risky investments. We'll see how it goes :)
I'm also looking on Amazon right now for some books on how to deal with this situation. (  ).
For now I only told two friends and my girlfriend (and the tax advisor). A couple other friends knew that I had this much bitcoins, but didn't know whether I sold or not. I don't want to share the news before I figure out how to tax it all.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:37:02
this would be a clusterfuck. imagine sending someone 1 (new)BTC, only to discover that the wallet software was not upgraded and you sent 1 (old) BTC.
and the amount of programming necessary for this change would be immense.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:34:52
even if it was being done on your side, it wouldn't necessarily be safe
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:13:49

"You're may"
Ever wanted to write one thing, and wrote something else by accident? I appreciate the fact that you want to verify me - best place would be to look in my posting history. I've posted about my financial situation back before the crash, and then after it.
You'll also find a proof that I probably know what bull/bear means. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:49:17
If it's a regular wallet, it could provide you just one of the addresses/primary keys the author of the software prepared beforehand. It doesn't even need to store them all in the source, it would be enough if random seed used for the wallet generation just wasn't too random.
If it's a brainwallet, similarily - a hashing function - could be compromised and you could receive just one of a very limited set of possible keys.
Then the attacker would watch all the million possible addresses generated by the app, with no communication with the computer necessary.
In other words - unless the software is written by a trustworthy person and verified by the community, you shouldn't trust it. Even if it's being run offline.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:42:07
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:45:03
You're right. So the best choice of action is not announcing you're planning to buy. It doesn't increase the price and it doesn't break the system.
