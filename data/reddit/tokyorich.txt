I am in the process of doing a story on it at the moment. A couple of things I learned: 1) Mt. Gox can happen again but not at the better run exchanges. So if you check your exchange's security properly, you can minimize risk. 2) Mining recent cryptocurrencies, which are easier to obtain with low CPU power, and then later exchanging them for bitcoin *if* their value goes up, has worked for some people.

Oh, I agree with that. But I was approaching the initial question as one that was being asked by somebody with knowledge of bitcoin's status. If you are concerned about a lack of regulatory oversight, there's really not much point in going for bitcoin at the moment.

For example,  It's not insider info. I've spoken to numerous people in security. But obviously I cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any exchange. I just read publicly available docs and spoke to industry affiliated people. Many don't trust bitcoin, that's fine. I was skeptical but I spoke to people and they convinced me Mt. Gox wasn't an industrywide thing. But there are plenty of other places I am sure are just as flawed.

Was not intended to come across that way at all. I just found it interesting -- as somebody that does not trade cryptocurrencies -- that these altcoins have found fans and are being used by different communities.

The basic premise is that better run exchanges keep their as many of their coins in "cold" (offline) wallets as possible. The only ones in "hot" (online) wallets are those needed to facilitate exchange liquidity. But there's a lot more to it. Basically, Mt. Gox was not built to handle the volumes of trade it ended up with. Some other exchanges are designed specifically for bitcoin.
