why not try Bitcoin Center or Bitcoin ATM in NYC, but they r charging around at $1543 or so.  So 0.0393 btc is around $60USD.  U might chk out the other 2 fellows earlier to see if they give u a better deal.  Forget about Coinbase, u hv 2 registered &amp; wait 8 days to get ur coins.

Jercos sold the 10,000 Bitcoin at around $400 in total, making a return of 10x.  So who was the next lucky guy?
