Regulations on exchanges are good - the things they propose are good things such as not letting minors buy crypto, not letting exchanges create unlimited virtual bank accounts, requiring proper id verification for every exchange.
Basically they want to stop sketchy exchanges that might be cheating their customers.

That's one guy who is anti-gambling, the rest are pushing for regulations instead of a ban. A lot of the 'ban' talk is also in reference to shady small exchanges who don't follow regulations properly. Note that the guy who wants a ban is the minister of justice. The minister of finance is actually in support of crypto and more regulations.
The more likely scenario is more regulations and taxing, which have already been discussed.

The exchanges aren't being shut down - the reports were mostly nonsense and the 'raids' were done by the tax department for tax compliance, not anything to do with shut down.
In fact Korean exchanges have already recovered half of the dip. It's a whole lot of panic over nothing.
Source: I trade on korean exchanges and Bitcoin is already back up to ~20,000,000 korean won here.

In the short term if you don't regulate exchanges you'll have more reports like the tiny exchanges/coin ico's in south korea that turned out to be ponzi schemes and stealing everyones money.
That was a big part of what kicked off all this regulation talk in Korea. There were some sketchy coins/tiny exchanges that cheated people out of a lot of money in s. korea. **The big thing is it's not regulations on the actual crypto, it's on the exchanges to force them to operate in a trustworthy, non 'craigslist sketchy seller' way.**

I believe most people who started on coinbase moved their coin to gdax cause it's free.
All the exchanges have kind of long verifications right now since they are getting flooded. I signed up for bitstamp earlier this week just in case I needed another exchange and they took 3 days to verify instead of 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:30:17
Yes but it still equals zero. Then if they magically make the short work, you think no bank is going to say "well let's pump it back up and buy longs now!"
Futures is zero sum, you don't need to worry so much about this sort of manipulation on bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:18:03
It's trending up. Look at the 12 hour graph from 7 hours ago till now. The downward trend ended then and it's been trending back up since: 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:39:21
Aren't you the same guy who predicted it was dropping to 11k last time due to your 'analysis'? Then it kept trending up to 15k+ after you said that... so I guess we're going up to 20k if you are as correct as earlier :p

Dam man, don't make your buying decisions from random reddit comments. You'll be in for pain if you do that.
Look at his comment history, he talks all sorts of crazy stuff and he literally only got his first hard wallet 6 days ago and didn't even know the difference in litecoin/bitcoin addresses.
Reddit comments is a horrible place to get qualified advice.

Dip might be over, hope people managed to grab the bottom of that before it rebounded for futures launch. Already gone back up +$300 in my exchange.
Seems a ton of people were waiting to buy that dip, I think a lot of us had the same idea to buy more in the dip before futures launch pushes price up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:36
So is this where we get to say "I told you so" to the people who were spreading lies about bitcoin tanking when futures started?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:59:57
People getting nervous haha, my exchange just dropped 400 then went back up immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:28:04
Looks like bithumb crashed. That's a good sign I guess, usually that happens when bitcoin is going up like crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:35:45
And if it's not lower? It's just as likely (some would say more likely) that too many traders will want long positions in the futures. If that's the case then the market will open and bitcoin would jump 20% quickly to catch up to the futures market before they suspend trading for the day, then bitcoin just continues to rise until it settles much higher.
That scenario is just as likely as the people randomly saying it'll be lower.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:58:19
You needed analysis to predict that bitcoin will dip ~$700 within 6 -12 hours of a 1 day high? Dude, it does that almost every single day. You could throw your analysis out and make that kind of prediction without analysis due to how much bitcoin moves around in 1 day.
I get that you're trying to apply currency analysis to bitcoin, but bitcoin is insanely volatile and your 'predictions' are so wide that they're useless and just general knowledge that anyone paying attention to bitcoin could guess.
If you could actually narrow it down to the hour and be more precise in the amount (you were off by $700~ today, which was about 40-50% more than your predicted move of $15.5k to 14k).
Saying you're right about this kind of prediction is like saying "Bitcoin is volatile guys!" Then coming back the next day when it swings around and says "see, I told you! My analysis is so right!"
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:38:48
Probably people realizing they were wrong about futures and buying back in before price goes up too much.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:22:28
Coinbase is easy to use but has a lot of limits at first (not to mention it crashes a lot due to popularity).
Most people move to other exchanges once they get more used to how exchanges work. The other exchanges tend to have less limits once you are verified/meet their trading requirements.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:23:59
? My graph shows different. Look at 1h, 12h and 1 day and 1 week.
You can see where it trends down, where it picks back up, etc. Right now it's way up for the week, down for the day, but has started equalling out if you look at 12h and 1h.
See for yourself:
It's only dropping because people are too dumb to look at the graphs themselves and are blindly buying and selling based on being scared of futures (which are a zero sum game anyway, meaning for every short there has to be a long aka. for a wall street guy to short bitcoin it would mean another wall street guy has the long at the same time).
So much worry just because people didn't even bother to look up what futures actually are and blindly believe this silly "wallstreet will short us to death!" nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:52:40
Being able to predict that 'bitcoin will dip at some point' isn't useful. Anyone can say that since bitcoin dips up and down constantly.
What's useful is being able to know when and where it will dip and by how much... which your analysis seems to be off there. You weren't even close and off by a large amount on your last prediction (~$2.5k off).
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:25:47
I got pretty lucky on that one. Manage to buy a bit within $50 of the lowest price on my exchange.
Hard to say who gets the better deal these days when the exchanges have a fair bit of difference in their prices. Depends where people live too, since some exchanges like Australia and Korea have higher prices, so their bottom prices are higher than even the US exchanges normal price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:33:59
I think this the problem. People watched 'The big short' and they are trying to apply their Ryan Gosling knowledge to bitcoin futures when a lot of it just simply doesn't apply or is totally different from how they think it works.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:12:23
But by that theory wall street is going to say "Hey guys I know we just did this amazing short and made tons of money to artificially push the price of bitcoin down... but now let's not repeat that and double our money by going long and pushing it back up!"
This worry over futures is silly because if they can manipulate it one way, they sure as heck could and would manipulate it back up again. Zero sum actually brings stability in the long term, even if there are big swings it will be both ways, not just short. This is futures - it takes 2 to tango.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:36:14
Yes, but recent downward trend doesn't mean a freefall. If you bought in the first week of december you should be up a decent bit and only neutral if you bought right at the end of that week.
Watch the 1 hour and 12 hour and you can see when it bottoms out and hops back up as has happened a few times. It's actually starting to look like it's bottomed out and has started to hold/trend back up if you look at it now.
Look at the last 5 hours on the 12 hour graph. Also use coindesk not coinbase because coinbase is crashing a lot and only has 1 exchange for their graph. If you look at the 12 hour in particular you can see the bottom is roughly that 13.2k mark and it's been holding or even trending back up slowly since that spot 5 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:40:52
What part do you not understand about how futures work with bitcoin? I'm not getting where you're confused here?
The fact is if someone goes long, there's also someone able to go short. It's zero sum. If someone is able to manipulate it one way, they can manipulate it back the other way as well.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:18:25
It's not expected, there was already a big dip 11 hours ago, unlikely to be another one, but who knows at the end of the day.
If you want to go by graph trending then it's been trending up for the last 11 hours though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:25:13
Yeah, a lot of people who understand futures are actually expecting bitcoin to go up a ton after this dip because people will realize futures aren't going to destroy bitcoin like they thought.
It would not be that surprising to see all time highs when people are done buying back in after their panic selling.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:38
If it's easy for them to do that as you think, it's just as easy to repeat the process and buy coins to drive it back up while holding longs.
Futures are zero sum, meaning no one can short unless there's an equal long on the opposite side of the contract. The fears of shorting don't really make much sense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:15:09
No, futures aren't your standard stock where you can do it alone. Every future contract is 'zero sum' meaning for every long buy, there is an equal short buy on the opposite side.
Basically this fear of wall street shorting bitcoin to death is silly because of how futures work: 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:40
Wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin go up a bunch today when all the people who sold due to 'futures so scary' buy back in now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:21:39
Futures isn't something to be scared about. Traders cannot just buy a short like a normal stock, every future contract is sold as a zero sum of 2 parties, so it has to have one person with a 'short' and one person with an equal 'long' position on the opposite side.
Even if one big trader wants to short it and manipulate it to push it down, the opposite side would have another trader wanting to push it up.
People are scared prices will fall, but that would just mean it'd be easier for someone holding a 'long' to push it back up.
Honestly it's just as likely that bitcoin could very well end up being pushed up a ton by futures as soon as the market opens.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:59:09
Dude. I'm discounting it because you were off by $2.5k. That's huge. If you were actually even close then maybe someone might believe your analysis. Not to mention your comment history seems like you only got into bitcoin like a week ago and barely knew how to operate a hard wallet.
For example, if you are off by the same amount today it would mean bitcoin won't even see any real dip from $15.5k right now on coindesk.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:47:26
I didn't say the bitcoin accumulation is zero sum. I'm talking about futures. Even if they move the market, it's would be just as easy for the opposite side to move the market back.
I don't really care if some wall street guy makes money shorting a 5-10% sell off, because some other guy will just make 5-10% buying and holding long. I'm not debating that there won't be volatile shifts and that no one will make money - that doesn't matter to bitcoin.
What matters is it actually becomes more stable eventually due to the push/pull from both sides and that people can quit worrying about some 'doomsday wallstreet short' since any short can also be reversed with a just as profitable long.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:50:46
The problem is people don't understand that futures are zero sum. You can't have one wall street guy shorting it without someone on the opposite side buying the long, it's not like regular stocks.
People worrying over nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:42:23
Unfortunately a lot of people who are new to bitcoin/trading are spreading a lot of bad info regarding futures. It is what it is, just trying to correct some misconceptions so they stop scaring people with false information about futures.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:49:15
Roughly yes, but no one knows for sure. You can look at the 12hour graph and see it bottomed out around 5 hours ago and has been steady/slowly trending back up since then.
See here (click 12h on the graph): 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:19:20
And if they did that, then them or other large traders could buy large amounts of bitcoins to push it back up while holding longs. Zero sum game. You answered the problem yourself, so what's there to discuss? If it goes down it just gets pulled back up by the opposite side.
I don't even know why I'm replying when you've literally confessed to being a uni student who owns zero crypto currency and just makes posts to try stir people: 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:39:07
It's just a joke to do with the movie 'The Big Short'. That's seemingly where a lot of people who make random comments about futures being the doom of bitcoin are getting their knowledge about shorting.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:07
Yes. On a whole futures means the push and pull becomes roughly a zero sum. What's your point?
I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here? I was never arguing whether there would be any shifts, rather that the push and pull of futures being a zero sum game would mean the fears of bitcoin futures were unfounded.
God why am I even replying still, you even admit that the point is valid. This is a waste of time. I'm just trying to help educate misinformed people, not wasting more time here. You don't even own or trade in any bitcoin, i think you just play devils advocate to entertain yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:55:44
Aye, I think a lot of people don't understand that futures are zero sum, not like stocks. For every wall street guy who shorts it, there would be an equal wall street guy going long on the opposite side.
A lot of worrying over nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:26:12
Futures only work with 2 parties involved in every contract (short + long have to equal zero). Don't worry so much about what the big banks etc. are doing.
For every big trader holding a short, there is an equal long holder on the opposite side of every single futures contract:
