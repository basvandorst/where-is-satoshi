Ok, Every single time when asking for GBP transactions I was forced to deal with Okpay. I was asked to provide Okpay account details. I even went to Okpay site to create account but site looked shady so I passed it.
There is new version of Bitsquare now and when I will have free moment I'll will check it again.

Bitcoin core is the best wallet, but not necessary the best for you. 
As a beginner get yourself Ledger wallet that works with google chrome. It is easy and safe. 
With time you can switch to electrum (still using ledger wallet) or bitcoin core if you really have to.
Stay safe.

Similar here. Was being asked for okpay account all the time. Okpay looks like some scam site and I can't deposit money there unless I'll use some yet another fishy site/method for transfers. Oh fuvk off with this bitsquare at least for now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:02:52
Well no.
You took text from some other discussion that is not related to what was discussed here and I never mentioned any alt by name here too.
Your attitude will prevent any dialog about bitcoin problems and is harming to bitcoin.
For your information I am not happy with current situation between bitcoin and bitcoin cash and their sharing mining force and I'm moving to ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:35:08
Is this statement or question or what? Still talking nonsense man.
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:28:13
Nothing is to big to fail.
All we need is ONE rushed decision without proper testing and consequences might be final.
Besides bitcoin polarized an idea that I hope will last even if bitcoin fail or will be replace by *coin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:22:11
Oh yes, that is a problem, but not as bad as you describing it. 
I see miners sharing between bitcoin and bitcoin cash as a problem to sort by adoption. We will see.
Edit: I checked and bitcoin cash 2 weeks average is closer to 6 blocks an hour than bitcoins. Amplitude is greater in short term. Still not bad.

It is telling how race to the top fees on btc chain works. I wrote about it so many times that now I don't bother to use many words, although probably I should.
No, I'm not trying to be ominous. I have no bad intentions, at least not in this thread.
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:07:40
Good. They can have mine username and password. They can also put some bitcoins there if they want. I won't judge.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:11:52
Please do visit other sub's from time to time to see how aggressive bitcoin supporters can be. 
You see, I'm waiting for lightning network but currently I am not using bitcoin at all, which probably you understand why, and I'm highly involved in other currencies (various). Although shilling can be nuisance (rai shilling was horrible lately), but what makes me really unhappy is internal fight between bch and btc supporters. 
I'll repeat myself, I have nothing against small blocks now (although I don't think is the best idea) as I have big blocks in bch.
If lightning network will be a success I will have no problem whatsoever to admit it and use it, but meanwhile I can't stand how much shit is being put on each other unnecessary.

My family knows I was bitcoin enthusiast big time. When bitcoin hit TV lately I got a lot of attention from my family closer and further.
My solution was to tell them each and every one with almost tears in my eyes that I unfortunately sold all of my bitcoin years ago.
Then we usually proceeded to have sad chat about how our life would look like if only I have kept bitcoin.
Only my wive knows.
Don't tell, stay quiet.

It is strange but my reply to you is not visible.
I know reddit has some problems today so I'll post it again maybe it will be OK this time.
I wrote before:
"I'm basically waiting for lightning network, but meanwhile I dropped btc completely as it is not usable to me. 
I only have one btc as a souvenir, but I'm coming to this sub as I love bitcoin and I need to monitor the situation.
Thanks for the link. Its nice summary."
Edit: and now both posts are here. I'm sorry I have some problems with reddit today.

Delusional children.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:57:45
Totally agree?
Op has no idea what he is saying. He is happy that his 290sat/byte transaction got confirmed very quickly and on that basis he dismiss high fees as not true or exaggeration.
But few weeks ago that very same fee would make him wait god knows how long.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:13:46
For traders yes. Is it strange?
You might not like it, but if there is trading opportunity than why not?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:22:49
It only has 225 transactions.
So double the size and ten times less transactions? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:36:03
Miners make blocks and fill them with unverified transactions from nodes mempool. That's it.
You got it wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:41:45
Who said it was bitcoin cash supporters that spam the network?
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:36:05
If coins return to sender after two weeks, they will de facto disappear from receivers ledger.
It is simply one of possible scenarios not fud.
Edit: if you are unhappy with word "disappear" I'll say it differently.
 It is possible that unconfirmed transaction might be dropped after two weeks from mempool and will never happen.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:13:02
Can somebody explain to me how this spam is possible? 
It must be extremely costly and no single perpetrator can do it forever.

Don't be like that. I had the very same impression of r/bitcoin riddled with stupid memes and attacks on different coins and solution.
I'm not a fan of lightning network at all, but it doesn't mean we can't stay civil and have proper chat on here or there. Fools are everywhere anyway.

I only hope that people make their own choices based on some facts and research. I am not convincing anybody to trust anybody.
What problem I'm referring to? I thought I was clear in my first post.
Scalability is a problem of bitcoin and current better situation is not negating that there are worse situations. Much worse in fact when people are unable to use bitcoin as a currency. Solutions are on the way, but are not here yet. Instead of bashing bitcoin cash it is better to concentrate on bitcoin IMO.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:34:09

About half way last year I dropped btc as I couldn't afford to use it due to high fees. I found better coin and moved.

They all will eventually.

495 sat/byte should have give you space in block chain much sooner. I can't see using segwit as an improvement in this case.

@_date: 2018-01-28 11:47:23
Oh dear, I have deja vu. 
Of course there were, from weeks before. I had to get to the next block and I know how to do my research. You have not much room to discuss my fee and I don't know what you are trying to achieve? Maybe point to me that at that time 900sat/byte would go through?
 Bottom line is that looking back it was worth it to send it to sell as I got very good price. Many people did the same. 
At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty and I have no clue what would I do now.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:11:46
Still laughing mate. Still laughing.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:10:16
Fees are going up and down depending on how full is mempool.
Last transaction I send I have paid 990satoshi /byte as that was the minimum amount needed to get to the next block at that time.
Transaction cost me £54 pounds.
That's the truth.

Look on LN, very promising and starting to take shape so expect better second half of a year.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:47:05
It saddens me when I read something like this.
If I'll do what you suggest and use some alt as a payment I can very well use it as a store of value too and there is no need of bitcoin at all in this scenario.
Why should i make atomic swap at the end of the month if I can simply continue to use alt? I'm not an investor and money needs to work for me.

If you are planning not to pull money from exchanges than how you are going to arbitrage between exchanges?
Only solution is to keep money already in few exchanges but you will have to balance the books eventually, sooner with low funds than big pockets.
I'm sorry, I think I'm only repeating myself and I don't know anymore what are you asking for.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:57:36
It was 3 days, but was raised to two weeks. (edit: this value can be changed by any node individually, but I mentioned defaults)
Anyone can rebroadcast your transaction anytime though and keep your transaction in mempool indefinitely. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:57:28
Snateeesh boom.
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:07:14
OK, mate, to make it perfectly clear I'll start with stating I know very well how to choose my fees and as I was making loads of transactions as a vendor in last few years I also have a lot of experience.
I know exactly how fee system work. 
I mentioned transactions from weeks before to highlight that specific danger of becoming transaction that sits for weeks.
When choosing fee you must understand all current estimations are based on the past and in order to gain certainty as much as reasonably possible, you have to add little more to compensate for possible spike in fees.
I don't believe I overpaid my fee, and even if I did somehow, I'm glad I left that coin at price I got.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:28:26
It used to be so easier to sell bitcoin anonymously in the past. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:57:26

Electron and electrum shared vulnerability that was addressed recently and it was advised to move btc and bch to wallets created with newest software as older wallets were probably already affected.
I'm not saying it was that, but probably.
Edit: that's the only link I found quickly, but this problem was discussed in this sub.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:18:36
Yes, you should create new wallet using new software and move your funds there as old wallet might be already compromised.

I would like to avoid conversation about fees importance in the next century and how good it is that we have this problem sorted already, but you do have a point highlighting bitcoins desirability and fees as a mark of it. There is logic in this. 
Just are you sure normal people are aware how high fees might actually be for them? 
I doubt it as too often I see complaints.
 Although I don't dismiss your point I think that currently fees might be a barrier for bitcoin breaking ath.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:43:46
Yes, I said the same in my different post in this thread. Moving btc to arbitrage is not an option at the moment both because of fees and confirmation times.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:54:30
Is it confirmed that Roger is behind bitcoin twitter account?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:17:15

You are the first person here that is coming with any alt name.
Are you shill?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:04:08
I'm very happy to answer that.
More than a year ago I noticed that fees might soon become a problem. I calculated that at about £10000 ($13500) per btc I will not be able to afford to use bitcoin in my business. From that I assumed most of vendors with product in £30-£150 price range will have to basically just drop bitcoin.
Exactly that happened. 
Price of bitcoin continued to rise to £15000 fueled by investors greed that just hodl and don't carry about fees, but at the same time bitcoin is losing dominance at grass root level.
That is it, and from this point I reckon that bitcoin will have to implement new technology (LN) or be adopted by big institutions that don't worry about fees, in order for btc price to go up.
Unfortunately, the bigger the delay of either of those scenarios, the bigger loss in market btc will have.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:17:40
Hmm, I see your point. 
By nothing is stopping him from arbitrage I meant that he can actually do if if he sorts problem with moving btc between exchanges and than I proceed to give examples how to do it.
1). Keep btc on few exchanges
2). Move money using some different coins.
But you are right. I think I overcomplicated things for op. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:22:57
How that fuck should I know?
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:49:58
So you have your answer. Originally you asked about arbitrage between exchanges.
 You can't do it now because fees of moving btc would kill your profit or long confirmation time of moving btc would make it impossible to arbitrage between exchanges.
You can mitigate those factors by keeping btc already on different exchanges and just buy and sell without moving any btc. I have already posted that.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:35:06
Wosp gets HUGE media coverage needs to be add.

@_date: 2018-01-07 21:52:37
OK. Thank you for your kindness. I wasn't expecting that much from you.
I move money quickly and I have no time for swapping from btc to bch to ETH. That is not what I do. Everything circulates with GBP as my purpose is to use crypto to make pounds. I'm not retarded hodler.
Now, bitcoin was my first crypto but is unusable anymore. There is no doubt about that. Every vendor will drop it sooner or later unless something change.
This is not a fud nor shilling any alt, but reality.
If bitcoin will be fixed, I'll come back in a heartbeat. I came to this thread to give opinion about why I reckon bitcoin will not hit god knows what in three years, but you are blinded and can't understand that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:15:05
Well, this is it.
Like I said originally this technology will get us to where we currently are.
About £15000 price per btc and huge fees and long confirmation times.
Unless LN network will be breakthrough or bitcoin become adopted by big institutions that don't care about fees, I can't see price going up. This whole thread was about price remember.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:40:15
Bitcoin is not finished product. In fact, many have different vision of how finished product should look like and how to get there. Meanwhile bitcoin must manage peoples expectations that people don't even realize they have. All strange things.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:10:19
He is actually close to true. 
I paid 950 or 990 (don't remember exactly)  satoshi/byte to get away from btc as quickly as possible on good price. 
I'll be back if ln turns to be good.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:39:29
People who use wallets with set fees or bad estimation.
People who don't care.
People who needs absolute certainty their bitcoin will get to the next block. Andreas Antonopoulos recently have sent btc with over 2000 satoshi/byte fee and that is telling.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:00:27
Fees are getting lower at the moment as mempool is clearing.
Do you want to use this fact to deny that bitcoin has problem with high fees that very often go way over mentioned $30? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:09:07
It can be profitable and good for market as it reduce volatility. You can't do it with transferring btc back and forth as fees and confirmation time will kill your plan, but you can park btc on few exchanges and start arbitrage without moving btc.
That requires big pockets though.
If you have small fund, just move money using for example litecoin or ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:12:10

Edit2: because of your edit.
Miners that don't have block chain don't have current block neither only block candidate. Do you want to tell me every node makes block for miners to hash on? Doesn't make sense.

Bitcoin technically is under attack in some way or the other all the time. I dare to say it is good for it as constantly bitcoin is proving how resilient it is.
Bitcoin cash is yet to be tested.
Making hostile attack between communities, especially childish name calling brings nothing just bad publicity and is wasting energy that could be used for something creative.
 If you like to pick up fights from time to time then I can say you are immature and not needed to bitcoin.
If you think you have to defend bitcoin, then it is little different story as motives are quite important. 
Anyway, in hostile environment on social level nothing good will be created.

Reason to increase blocks is to have bigger blocks that will have capacity to  carry more transactions or/and more inputs and outputs. There are obvious benefits in that which is undeniable.
However, it is not the way of bitcoin and that has to be clear.

Yes, but tether is being used to print money out of thin air to buy bitcoin. 
That shit is on bitcoin.

And all the other vendors. Wonder how it will work for bitcoin when everybody move to alts.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:16:13
Simply mempool is being cleared faster than filled.
Is it due to more blocks being mined in shorter time or less transactions being sent, I don't know, but in October last year you could send bitcoin with 1 satoshi/byte fee and be included in the next block, while in December that skyrocketed to 1000 satoshi/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:35:02

I'm on Mobile and is hard for me to paste, but let me address three points you raised.
First, we do want to test bitcoin. It must be as best as possible in every area.
Second, when you said "bcash" you already started to be a problem.
And last - When it comes to truth I think you hit the nail. 
In hostile environment there is no truth only shouting offensive epithets. You will fill heads of willing to listen with war propaganda, not truth. Think about it.

I sometimes wonder do those people writing this kind of articles are actually using bitcoin at all?
Bitcoin has hit its ceiling of about £15000 ($20000) and is not going to go past that due to very high fees and long confirmation times, unless lightning network solves this problem or simply bitcoin will be adopted by institutions that don't care about fees.
Other than that no way of $500k ever.
Edit: USD value added.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:14:31
That's the problem with crypto world as most of this tech is new and untested, prone to have bugs and mistakes. At the same time there is plenty of money to be stolen so also plenty of attempts to do so.
Don't take to much blame on yourself. Buying hardware wallet is a way to go though.
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:27:12
I agree that there is many posts about bitcoin cash and I have to add when compared to r/bitcoin it might appear like bch sub, but I wouldn't say "they" (that's me too) are hostile towards bitcoin.
There is plenty aggressive idiots there shitting on bitcoin, but here we have plenty of aggressive idiots shitting on bitcoin cash.
Anyway, I always encourage to gather information from many sources as one might be very biased.
On top of r/btc and r/bitcoin there is plenty of good crypto related subs.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:42:29
I'm basically waiting for lightning network, but meanwhile I dropped btc completely as it is not usable to me.

My transactions on bch chain are cheap and work. 
On btc not cheap and don't go through.
Easy choice and mempool will be OK
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:57:38
Actually it is a lot of wrong information, so for the balance:
1.) Bitcoin has much more centralized "governance" with its Block stream organization.
2.) Miners are the same on both chains. They can choose which chain to mine.
3.) Similar to bitcoin mining, same situation with nodes. User can run node if he choose to.
4.) Easy done on both chains due to points 1-3
5.) That is just nonsense. Segwit is malleability fix mostly to enable unconfirmed transaction chain for lightning network. Segwit is not needed to operate on big blocks and is not the only solution to transaction malleability which in fact is no issue anyway for current tech.
6.) Block size increase is working fine on bitcoin cash chain and it will be increased if needed
7.) Lightning network is not needed on bitcoin cash chain, but if you really want it, it can be implemented while choosing different solutions than segwit.
8.) Uhhhh, which community we talk about now?
9.) Both sides have dirty tricks on their souls.
10.) Sorry, just nonsense.
P.s. as a bitcoin fan I am really happy with bitcoin cash existence as that allows people to choose which one to use and what solutions to test. Bitcoin can have lightning network (I'm waiting anxiously for it) and small blocks while bitcoin cash can have big blocks and everybody should be happy. 
I don't understand this venom both parties carry. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:35:48
Edit: forget it. I was looking at wrong column :(
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:29:34
Second layer solution needs small blocks to allow everybody running node easily.
Big blocks is not the way of btc.

Yes, but those transaction with much lower fee were probably waiting days or weeks to get to the block I jumped in.

@_date: 2018-01-21 00:12:33

@_date: 2018-01-10 22:29:11
Good start. Now ten times.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:25:57
That was the lowest fee then to get to the next block and it was a good move to leave btc.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:35:17
OK, internal fight maybe is wrong set of words, but I agree that now it is better for bitcoin and its community.
All more I wish is to people to concentrate more on building and adoption rather than fighting. Best will come on top in the end anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:21:05
Fee I paid was minimum to get to the next block. That was based on estimations from previous blocks. 
There were tx with less fees in block, I'm sure of it, and you use it to dismiss my claim I used minimum fee required to the next block. OK, that's fine as you are right.
However, at the time of making estimation the fee I used was minimum required to get to the next block. You see the difference?
Estimated fee to be minimum to be included in next block doesn't mean it will be the lowest fee into the block.
You would have known that if you had to use bitcoin more often. I really don't think you know how the fee system work in practice.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:04:35
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't notice it was about LN now. I know quite a bit about Lightning Network, but I don't know why do you relate it to what I have written before.

I agree with you mostly, but only if lightning network will indeed deliver.
Without LN on horizon and fees of £20 area bitcoin has no place in the price range it was at ath. Things are just getting started and bitcoin might skyrocket past mentioned 25k, but not at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:23:48
Again, it wasn't about LN at all.
You are nuts?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:55:29
Fee is a fault of high mempool and race to the top in the fee system.
There is no user fault.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:27:05
Like I already responded, there were transactions in the very same block with lower fees, but they were waiting to get there.
You have made post on r/bitcoin about fees and you have no basic understanding how fees work.
Don't mislead people into false security that everything is OK and high fees is fud.
Somebody will come back crying for help because his transaction is stuck with to low fee thanks to you.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:14:09
Well, in theory they should go back to sender if not confirmed in two weeks, but also transaction might be confirmed when mempool clears a little or simply transaction might stay in limbo unconfirmed for god knows how long.
Its not fud.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:26:05
What? This is silly. Why do you even suggest this is a reason I have bough bitcoin in the first place?

It is your second post I am not really sure you submitted to the correct thread.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:27:18
Transactions above 60satoshi/byte are not being dropped at all for a while now and all above are getting confirmed eventually on every drop in mempool and fees.
Alleged spam is quite often quite high in priority as spam is not only in very low level.
All this theory of intentional spam has only sense to me with assumption that those are miners themselves doing that, but that would be devastating to my trust in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:11:44
Exactly, plus recently bitcoin had few 2mb blocks with very little transactions, but big in size too.
Edit: no disrespect, but those big blocks with few transactions were reason to be proud for bitcoin supporters. How about that? I couldn't believe.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:30:23
Are you scared or what?
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:25:07

Pretty much every single one. Just send above £100 with bitcoin in description and watch new shiny letter arriving in your house apologizing that your acc is restricted and under investigation.
If you are not lucky, soon after bank will say thank you, but take your money away as account is closed, and no, no further explanation given.
I don't know is it still the case but for last few years I burned few accounts this way.
Of course there might be different reasons for banks behaving like this, maybe, I don't know, I'm a terrorist and don't even know about it.

I am somewhat surprised how surprised you are. Big blocks are working exactly like expected and there is nothing strange about that.
There is much more going on than just number of transactions in big blocks, things that are not possible on small blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:16
Full mempool. That is unprecedented as far as I know and huge.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:40
I was seller with many transactions in £30-£150 range. I'm done, fees of mixing and transfer further killed me. Not to mentioned that prices had to be increased and is hard to stay competitive.
Now transactions are so delayed there is no point of using btc at all.
I was looking for alternatives and had high hopes for litecoin at some point, but people didn't want to switch or were doing it slowly.
Since bitcoin cash I feel like 2012 is back here again and I have no doubt bitcoin cash will be big. There is no need to convince people, they are sold after first use.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:08:39
If you had been reputable person whose action could cost me a lot of money, yes I would be upset to say the least.

Well, I did, but that is not the point.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:32:56
I have no words....
You asked first how miners will cope with bigger blocks and my answer is easily. Miners have much much more powerful hardware than average home user and even home computers will cope.
I thought we are talking about nodes, not miners, as miners will have no problems at all.
Growth of resources used along with hardware available was planned in the beginning of bitcoin. How hard is to understand that.
Growth should be careful of course, but should be.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:39:27
Oh yes, I agree with you.
Little above 6 or below is not bad. Big differences is what we want to avoid and bitcoin is better in that than bitcoin cash. 
Saying that bitcoin cash is not in peril or unusable like somebody almost suggested at the beginning.
I actually keep watching this space very closely.
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:49:36
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:47
True only partially as Bitcoin cash with 8mb would easily keep current bitcoin transaction level without growing mempool and fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:19:01
You have a valid point and that is why I regret core didn't decide to raise slowly maxblocksize with segwit. Bigger blocks shouldn't be only solution, but situation with 1mb only shouldn't be forever too.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:06:24
Its called bitcoin cash and you call it bcash because you want to be malicious and probably are bitter.
I asked originally about consensus because I wanted to know what do you mean by that. Now I think I understand where we differ.
I am glad bitcoin cash hasn't got segwit as I do not support it.
I am absolutely 100% against rbf. That was massive mistake along with 2 weeks drop period.
I am, again super frustrated with 1mb blocks as they were supposed to be bigger long time ago.
All this was consensus (technically and socially) not that long ago. So bitcoin didn't have segwit, rbf and 1mb was temporary.
Time has change bitcoin moved one way, bitcoin cash the other. Both routes are worth watching and should be discussed in this sub, by I am not going to insist.
Edit: bitcoin cash is closer to bitcoin vision and whitepaper I remember than bitcoin itself. Is it bad?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:21:43
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:38:53
It is simply because in bitcoin sub it is impossible to talk about bitcoin cash without triggering some hateful troll. Btc seems to be more tolerant.

One thing? That knowledge is way more important than rushed buying bitcoin.
Buy book about bitcoin first. At least understand basics for your own good. I'm not asking you to master elliptic curve in cryptography, but anything read about btc will save you time, money and a lot of nerves.
It might lead to new career, who knows?

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:05:58
1.) You can't afford that and bitcoin cash will handle it anyway.
2.) You will feed miners on bch chain and make them more likely to stay on bch chain
3.) Bch supporters would be able to start to say adoption has increased.
Don't touch bch unless you want it succeed. I recommend using both btc and bch to see the difference. :)

5.) Borrow.

Majority of bitcoin cash users tells bcash is offensive, but you choose to go against consensus and just use bcash word anyway.

It is not hard to say bitcoin cash. You can short it to bch if you want that. Bcash is petty and you continue to be petty. Good luck in bitcoin cash community with this attitude.
Bitcoin cash deserves bitcoin part in its name as it is continuation of original bitcoin. 
Bitcoin in its current form is further away from original bitcoin than bitcoin cash. Should we rename bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:03
Bitcoin is already centralized as full nodes can only be sufficiently run by big miners and bigger blocks were always supposed to be introduced when needed as Satoshi introduced 1mb maxblocksize as a temporary measure.
Ffs, Satoshi was bigger blocks shill according your definition.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:43
Of course, but one of many.
All arguments against block increase a dull lies and fud though. I'm talking about small and slow increase.

You have the right to use whatever word you want, but I don't have the right to choose is it offensive or not to me?
Where did you take that from? 
Idiot is word already recognised for years and I only used to highlight extreme, but bcash has been negatively enforced from very beginning in this sub using very negative connotations. It is hard to deny that. On that basis alone you are being malicious.
When somebody is telling you to stop because you shouldn't do that, you ought to stop. For the rapist for example sex is fun, for the victim it is not. Who are you to tell differently?

You don't sound like new tbh as you are completely spot on just add decentralization and security and that how bitcoin was pictured. At least I remember it that way.
Unfortunately most of principles got lost along the way, but don't worry. Bitcoin brought also an idea that lives on in many projects and, what's more important, in many hearts.
When it comes to bitcoin, let's keep close look at it, but don't hold your breath as it is currently becoming quick get rich scheme for investors. Hopefully that is price to pay for greater good.

@_date: 2017-12-02 23:35:56
It is a thought.
So maybe it will be better to reduce block size by half but making them more frequent, like for example every 2.5 minute?
How about that?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:55:27
If you are not in hurry and set very low fee, your transaction as you already know, might be dropped after two weeks and it will be as nothing happened, so no risk for you of losing anything.
Problem is, that such a transaction might as well repeatedly be rebroadcast by some party like your wallet or some node, and effectively make your transaction "unconfirmed" but not dropped for very very long time, which is way longer than 2 weeks.
Don't worry though. You are sending to yourself so don't be afraid to experiment.

Bittylicious is your friend in UK
As a beginner, ledger wallet plus bittylicious is all you need.

Oh sorry. You are right, I misread you.
Coinbase stated clearly it will be in January not before though.

"Pure" bitcoin was supposed to have 1mb maxblocksize as a temporary measure, not forever.
Why not ask for bigger blocks?
Asking is not a crime.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:28:55
All true, just bitcoin.com is not scam site.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:30
It is not copycat, it is reversing few bad decisions and that already pays off and brings hope.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:48:20
I don't think mempool was ever maxed before.
Don't get me wrong, I still believe bitcoin will hit 50000, but not with current problems.
That is not business as usual.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:42:43
Don't. Highly addictive. You've been warned.

I already have his books (both mastering bitcoin editions) and always recommend his books to others although I don't agree with all his views.
Let's be fair, how he invest his money is not my business. Is he successful or not is also not my concern however I really wish him well as he deserve it.
If he is accepting bitcoin cash (I know I know, not welcome here) I am very willing to support him, no problem.
Edit: p.s. shame to admit but never heard of patreon before.

I can't answer your question but thanks for sources. 
I have plenty of time over Christmas to read.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:29:58
Yeah, but according to my calculation its closer to 2.96787613.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:29:42
Can you make it as a link, please?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:22
Why do you think it was Roger and "etc"?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:16:23
You will have to have opened channel to a node to which other party will also have opened channel. In effect big hubs will be created that will have centralized function similar to banks.
You can have of course direct channel to person you want deal with but mist likely lightning network is huge centralization attempt.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:29
It is.
Block size was supposed to be increased when needed! That was the plan from the beginning so what changed? That was scaling. One of few options of course, but option nevertheless.
We need block size increase. Slowly, but surely. I don't understand resistance to that idea. Nobody is asking for 1gb blocks tomorrow, but 2mb or even maybe 4mb now would help significantly before lightning network or other solutions.
Doing nothing is almost malicious.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:01:22
OK, and how big transaction was it? 
Look on sat/byte rather than fee in btc.
Edit: how big in bytes, not how much money...
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:40:55
Oh yes. That is why I was so unhappy with block stream refusal of segwit2x as soon as they got segwit part.
I was really unhappy but I found solace in bitcoin cash. I don't hide the fact though, that I would rather have slow and careful block increase with core than with god know who and god know how fast and to what end.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:23:15
I always encourage new users to try and use both coins. The difference surface very quickly to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:08:33
The problem is lots of people can not use bitcoin due to fees. Wake up and look what is happening.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:38:23
It will be dropped after 2 weeks unless node will rebroadcast it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:01:13
Not really. I want to move to bitcoin cash from bitcoin as I don't use bitcoin anymore due to fees.
My agenda is to support bitcoin as much as possible so I will be able to sell it in January for a good price when people start to dump their coinbase bch. Obviously I got burn by waiting, but that's life.
Don't assume shills are shilling the way you think.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:56:23
No, I'm saying that currently mempool is full and using btc is very expensive, selling too.
Wait for lightning network if you believe in it to sort fees issue.
When people realize they can't move money to sell, panic might occur.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:05
:D have that, much wow :D
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:18:16
None of my friends or associates have made this mistake.
There is bitcoin and there is bitcoin cash. Just be precise and no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:44:32
And I answered that - easily.
It is harder to carry mempool than bigger blocks. Growth to 8mb is nothing now.
Edit: -
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:20:36
To be clear, I'm not entirely happy with bitcoin cash name. I don't have better though.
Clue to understanding mine frustration with rejection of bitcoin cash in this sub is in what you perceive as simple - consensus.
This sub is about bitcoin, yes, but what should those do that don't agree with everything or have different views on some parts? Accept majority or go away?
What about trying to shape opinion of majority? It can not happened here if different views (like bitcoin cash) are being quickly dismissed, called names and forbidden. That's not consensus emerging but dictatorship. Careful.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:20:40
Sell sell sell.
I need to buy cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:37:57
Yes, bitcoin has problems but I still reckon it can hit £50000 in 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:16:04
Exactly, that what is said.
I'm sorry, I think I'm losing a plot here.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:22:21
Just slow down and take your time. Its only confusing at the beginning.
Yes, simple qr creator should do it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:51:20
Oh, I certainly moved away already.
Bitcoin doesn't have to apologize, I love it anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:55:24
If you think I didn't answer your question I'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:01:36
Sell as quickly as possible before price will drop.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:19:56
Yes, true, but can you tell me what do you mean by consensus?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:41:14
Stop calling bitcoin shitcoin, please!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:41:58
I really encourage to stop using btc currently until lightning network arrives. It is just not viable as fees are extremely high.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:10
Check bitcoinfees.earn.com
It will give you rough idea.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:24:29
Not legal and you will get nothing but trouble.
Just forget it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:32:04
Its not only the wallet but also node that holds it in its mempool already.
It is beyond control really, but it should be 2 weeks if lucky.
(Or mempool gets so big it will start dropping 60sat/byte tx.)
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:47:16
Thanks. 
I can't believe how high fees are now. This one should take up to 3 days. Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:32:01
Same question was popping occasionally in 2012... and 2013,2014, 2015, 2016 and in 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:27:19
I have patience alright.
I'm waiting only for lightning network to check am I wrong or not, but I stopped using bitcoin already as fees killed my business. Saying that I'm in bitcoin because of idea primarily, money is on second place.
Problem is, that I think my idea of bitcoin doesn't go well with current bitcoin route. I'll wait and see as I am patient.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:29:10
I mean as far as I understand keeping money on any exchange is a risk, but do you think binance in particular is risky place to keep btc?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:38:23
Bigger blocks is not a way forward for bitcoin. That was discussed here many times.
Fees might be lowered by lightning network. I hope.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:10
Your post is 100% correct only with assumption that max block size was design to be as it is forever. And it wasn't so current high fees situation wasn't in bitcoin design.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:07
Buy £100 bitcoin. 
1.) Don't keep it in exchange. Send it to ledger - fee £40
2.) You need to spend it? Send it back to exchange - fee £40
3.) Wait 3 days
4.) Enjoy your £20 :)
And all you had to do is hodl it you idiot, :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:25:34
Yep, I hold my savings in monero.
Besides there is no problem to have several wallets in bitcoin or any other Crypto I know.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:50:39
You can't due to high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:09:11
Im for £50000 by the end of 2018. Sooner if LN released earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:23:25
There is nothing wrong to actually use bitcoin cash and bitcoin at the same time.
Most of posts about "bcash" is just petty and utter waste of time. It would be better to focus on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:22:20
English is not my first language I admit but I'm not going to hide behind that.
My understanding was that bch will appear after 1st January 2018. It is possible I've made mistake and I will have to look into that, but still I think recent events were rather surprise for everybody. It shouldn't happened like that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:03
But remember to email to CNN or whatever telling that Roger is not a bitcoin Jesus.
That's the agenda now, :D
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:41:45
Little above 1 as a souvenir hanging in paper wallet on my wall.
Other than that, I'm out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:09:58
One can ask similar question: is it hard to understand that lightning network will centralize bitcoin?
See what I did here?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:46:28
So first consensus is rules and then is majority, depends what suits the narrative?
Bitcoin cash is a different route and I understand many might not like it, but it is real shame it is being discarded in this sub, ridiculed and dismissed as not fit with vision, consensus or whatnot.
Real shame is also when it is being attacked by petty trolls calling it bcash rather than basically talk about it in normal way. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:03:04
Well, let's hope so. Meanwhile it is good to have competition, isn't?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:18:02
0.005 btc/KB is nothing else than 500000 satoshi per KB, or about 500 sat/byte.
Basic and simple transaction has 226 bytes, so 226*500 is equal to 113000 so nothing else than fee of 113000 satoshi or simpler 0.00113000 btc.
Assuming bitcoin is worth £12500, fee of 0.00113000 is = 12500*0.00113000= 14.12.
So, with assumption above fee will be £14.12.
Edit: by simple and basic transaction I mean non segwit transaction with 1 input and 1 output.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:54:51
All mostly true, just the part about coffee polluting blockchain puts us apart. 
I guess time will tell which path was better.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:09:21
All this "use segwit" agenda is a little sad attempt to misdirect attention from root problem. Segwit even used fully will not help much.

Can you name few for testing purposes?

I think I did quite clearly. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:25:25
Easily, that size of blocks is nothing for today's home computers or network.
 Besides, I would more worry how today's PC can handle growing mempool...
Edit: guys, are you actually running any node? Because it sounds you have no idea what you talk about.

Ekhm, bitcoin cash sort fees problem. That is big.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:23:35
You make to much of assumptions!
What public clearly support btc? You mean on reddit? TV? 
You assume who is highly competent and who is greedy,  but you can't know that or at least I doubt you do. Just look on segwit2x you mentioned. Yes, somebody was awful, but not the side you think.
White paper calls for decentralization that already is lost to the few miners and 1mb block was supposed to be temporary. Nobody wants "huge" blocks, just growth like in white paper.
Don't assume so much, open your eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:35:16
OK, how you are going to fight FUD? With discussion or ignorance?
Serious question as I reckon fud comes from fear or at least feed on it.

Those with commodity in mind stay with btc.
I'm so happy with this and I'm very optimistic for the future.

And I thought they are generous, but we will see I hope.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:28:39
Btc divided all with its segwit and crippling block that was always suppose to be temporary, it wasn't bch doing.
Bch is continuation of original concept and even if btc turns into the right branch it is just the branch nevertheless. 
(I just don't want anyone to lose their money because they trusted people like {block stream}. BTC doesn't bring anything useful to the table, it just divides the users and creates risk needlessly.)
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:42:49
I am not a shill. Dude.
Side chain that will take pressure away from block chain as it will push users away from it. I keep saying the same for a while now. Only financial institutions will use chain while users will exist on centralized hubs. That is worrying and I am not saying that to shill other Cryptos, but to highlight issue.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:46:13
Exactly. There is no point of fighting bitcoin openly. It is better just block its development. Make argues and spread shit about it.
Job done.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:35
"Copy the idea...."
Mate, how little you know.
Bitcoin cash is the original idea. No segwit, no rbf, no 2 weeks drop mempool, low fees and quick confirmation.
This is bitcoin like at the beginning and how it meant to be.
You will not learn that on sub sadly.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:14:43
Intersango  £1.2-£1.3 for testing purposes.
First bought bitcoin as before mainnet wasn't much different than testnet.
Who would have known....
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:02
Oh man. Do you use bitcoin currently? I mean do you actually pay for or sell something?
Hodlers will not understand, users have no need to be explained basics.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:10:56
I understand.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:40
A solution in the article is "pay more fees".
Good God, for a moment I thought increasing maxmempool will be pushed :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:05:50
I have no intention to attack r/bitcoin. I feel quite good here as more and more I can actually have a chat about bitcoin, its future, positives and what problems I have while using it. Unfortunately I do have problems with bitcoin, most noticeable with high fees lately.
But that is not all. I'm not a fan of segwit and I am suspicious or vary of lightning network, but I don't mind seeing it at work. 
I still trust core devs a little, I admire their efforts to make btc work, but I not always agree with everything even if I don't feel I have the right to be overly vocal about it.
Anyway, recently bitcoin cash appeared and for me it was best thing that could happened as nobody has to argue about bitcoins future anymore. We can simply go different route and see what will be better. Little competition is not bad.
On top of that bitcoin cash feels like bitcoin in 2012 and I am very optimistic about it, but I wouldn't dismiss bitcoin just yet. I'm still waiting for lightning network and more.
Going back to bitcoin, I really deeply regret we didn't have at least small increase in block size along with segwit.
P.s. about Roger and co, yes I understand concerns but I'm trying to concentrate on tech and usability and keep my eyes open.
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:51:38


not true
DD can be set with only those. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:27:57
Or pay you by cash and this way there is no more trace of transaction. 
This was basic and best way to buy bitcoin in the past.

Please take a look at my edit in main post. It looks like it is possible to take loan tied to currency you earn in.
Taking regular loan is easy, but I hope in future bitcoin will "take over" that sector too :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 05:47:58
Bitcoin should have 10 000 000 bits like at the begining- end of story.

It doesn't matter. Bitcoin is more convenient.
I lived in uk for few years and every month I was sending money to Poland to my wife. It was nightmare. There was always something wrong with transfers. Problems were on both sides, uk and Poland.
I used Western Union few times, friends, and God knows what else.
Bitcoin was a real revolution for me. I was buying bitcoins at Intersango and selling them (member of my family was doing that to be precise) in Poland for cash without any problems.
 To this day, it is easier to deal with bitcoins in Poland than it is in uk.
In uk there is plenty of junkies and scammers trying to rob you while in Poland I have never had any problems.
edit: mistakes
edit2: That is how I actually stumble upon bitcoin. I needed easy and relatively cheap way to transfer large (for me) amounts of money. Bitcoin worked flawlessly. Now I love it as an idea.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:43:03
I've tried that just for test and it came out as a very expensive way to buy bitcoins.

Good point.
I think of altcoins as of testing grounds for new features.
Solutions that will proof to be good are hopefully going to be implemented into Bitcoin.
I monitor many currencies because of that.
To answer the question - no, there is no competitor for bitcoin at the moment.

Of course people where doing that before bitcoin, but since this way arrived, it is the best. At least for me. I do not know, maybe big "cartels" use trade option - small guy like me uses bitcoin.

No, it isn't good forum for loans but I had hope it might be good forum for bitcoin. I am not person who spend a lot on cars and I think you misjudged me.
Thank you for your recommendation though, this is what I was hoping to get.
P.s Loan for a year will cost me about 150-200 like I said earlier, and that is not a lot for the pleasure of having it now. I do also think I shouldn't wait.

You most likely have wallet.dat somewhere and possibly have bitcoins. Do not delete anything.
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:29:30
Is it really gone forever?
 I mean is it not possible for somebody to create wallet.dat with this private key? Is not like this one private key is marked somwhere as already used. 
It is highly unlikely as far I understand, but possible. I think it can be a potential problem in far future.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:50:49
My little theories:
So far price was going up because people were buying and keeping coins with hope of price going up even more. (Bitcoin as a derivative of gold.)
Lately, many new initiatives provided people with new and easy ways of SPENDING coins. No more hoarding. Just pay for your music, laptop, hotel or porn easily and securely. (Bitcoin as a payment method.)
This shift is pulling price down, but I reckon only in first phase. Bitcoin is in its infancy and I love to look at it while is being adopted by masses. All of this will be history I hope, taught in Uni at some point.
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:28:52

Oh man. I was not sure should I answer you but I will.
I am not planning to stay poor and I am definitely not poor at the moment.
 I have got no debt, never had any, except mortgage that I took quite recently and that is alone the only reason I am pretty much out of cash right now. As I mentioned at the beginning I've got 2k savings.
I have also proper order in my funds. Everything is well taken care off. There is no place for wasting money.
About car loan? You see, My car I owe for over 10 years now and it really needs to be changed in next few months. I can keep going with what I have but in uk repairs are very expensive. 
If I take loan for about 5 thousand pounds cost of it will be about 150-200 in a year. Less than I have for cashback so please spare me pointless comments.
I am very frugal about my money and don't think that car loan is immediately something wrong and stupid.

Do you want to take risk of freezing your money in very volatile market? Big risk means it can go both ways big time.
 2030 is very distance future for fairly new technology. By then bitcoin might me replaced by something far better (I hope so), and nobody really can tell you more.

Then they will lose as they are fighting on the wrong field. Bringing down btc will not stop different alts to grow, on the contrary, it might be very beneficial to them.
Btc future is not the most important. Some attackers will just lose money or time. Or both.
@_date: 2014-06-28 14:27:33

Well, I am in similar situation to op although I don't worry as my journey with bitcoin ended years ago. His question was a good one though.
I have still btc on paper wallets but honestly I couldn't care less about what  **Chinese miners** will do or not do to them. I'll take the gamble.
Don't worry about btc to much, there are better things on the horizon. In encryption we trust.

Long time btc fan here.
Wishful thinking, that's what come to my mind after reading your post. 
I hold some btc but I don't use them anymore and don't buy more.
There are better (more promising) Cryptos out there and I have no time for btc drama. Time to work on one else. 
I will never forget that when btc was very new, few theoretical plans have been discussed how to take it down. Well, it is happening.  Anonymity is nearly gone, network is highly centralized, cost of running and using is high and coins can be tainted. 
Let's work on something else.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:26:34

Hi. I just heard about those changes and I must say I am not impressed. 
I might be wrong but for me this whole thing is a sign of btc weakness. Splits and arguments never builds better future. 
Most of normal people who just want to use bitcoin without going to much into its ideology or technicalities will probably think same as me.
So my prediction: price will go down. (To much confusion, to much fear.)

It has nothing to do with fees more with privacy and liquidity. Not all deals are made with btc. Some are/were made using Darkcoin or Monero. 
To answer your question  - nothing will happen to btc price as almost always btc is one of steps of money moving.

Well, you don't know it is intentionally deceptive, you just assume it.
It is bitcoin after all and I reckon on this sub many are just petty again and want to harm bitcoin cash.
People were sending money from btc to litecoin addresses before because they were not paying attention and you will never get rid of that on current technological level where addresses look like they look. Some level of awerness is required when dealing with money.

@_date: 2017-08-02 13:41:51
Pretty much yes as long as you control secret keys to your btc or you keep them where split was recognized. 
I think hardware ledger automatically split btc from bcc but I didn't try it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:52:30
Point is that you are being petty and try to attack bitcoin cash out of some low needs, I don't know, maybe you are jealous.
Bitcoin cash is very good for bitcoin itself as it sorted governance problem. Don't like segwit? Split away. No problem. No need to make shit storm against bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:26:44
Electrum is for you I think. It can sweep private keys to its addresses. Very efficient.

I doubt it will but just be patient.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:17:44
Hmm, fees are high even off peak times. 
There is plenty of new "investors" buying bitcoin to become rich in a year, only to find their money seems to go away when they use it.
No wonder they come crying here. It is bitcoin sub after all.

@_date: 2017-08-28 17:26:40
It is not to late to start mining, but you do have to spend a lot of time to learn how to be efficient. Money is an issue too but that's obvious.

@_date: 2017-08-03 08:56:50
Is that all you have got to say? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:30:40
You don't have to download whole 130gb to get your btc but you do HAVE to have wallet passphrase.
Open bitcoin core and go to console. 
There unlock wallet using walletpassphrase command.
    walletpassphrase "known password" 120
Where 120 is timeout. 120 should be long enough.
Then use dumpwallet command.
    dumpwallet wallet.txt 
Where wallet.txt is name of file you want to get.
For problems look here
 
Once wallet.txt will be located, you can check every single address from there in any block explorer, like blockchain.info to find which address contains unspend bitcoins. 
(Do not paste secret keys anywhere yet).
If you lucky you will have address with btc you can import to any mobile or light wallet. Mycelium on android is good however it has high fees. Just use in mycelium secret key that corresponds to that lucky address. There should be some import option.
If you are lucky and get 100+ feel free to send me one.
Edit: sorry I'm half a sleep. To check is wallet encrypted just try to dump wallet first without walletpassphrase command. If computer says no and that you need walletpassphrase than you know you need it. 
I think in bitcoin core you can also hover over few icons at the bottom of the GUI wallet to check like connection status or block height status and there is also highlighted encryption status. I can't check it now though. I'm on mobile at the moment.
Edit 2: make sure you got latest bitcoin core or dumpwallet will not work.

Come on. You were doing research on mining and yet you don't remember WHERE or HOW you bought btc? That doesn't make sense.
Anyway, with so little information it is safe to say your btc is gone. You have to give more details.

I think i understand your point. Internet slowly at first became almost magical place and you reckon same will happen to btc therefore rise in price is justified.
Well, I have my doubts about btc. Anyway, I will stand at the moment that price prediction for btc is nothing more now than wishful thinking and blokes yelling "to the moon" and so on are just lunatics.
There is plenty of post encouraging such a attitude which is stupid and counter productive. It can bring some therapeutic value to mentally unstable however.

The most fud is here. In this sub. People are nasty here if you don't agree with them. As much as I support bitcoin I am sure I can get more help and better quality discussion in BTc sub.

Bye samourai. Just uninstalled.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:22:25
Lets give it some time. I'm sure it will become more popular and its impact will be more noticeable.
Months are minimum, not days.
@_date: 2016-11-26 08:42:09
They are trying thougt. I am spammed by indian scammers on mycelium for the few days now. It is shame that btc attracts so many shady people.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:39:29
Jesus. 
War, especially nuclear, never was and never will be good to anybody.
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:48:59
There are always the lowest trying to scam, use the situation, is it in bitcoin or any other community. Always have been like that.
There is bitcoin and there is bitcoin cash. There is difference in them as they have different chains. 
I am thinking about it now and actually it would be great to separate them both more in name. You are right that for newbie "cash" bit might be not important as soon as "bitcoin" has been mentioned.
However, ideally new name shouldn't be imposed on bitcoin cash as this is petty say what you want, but bitcoin cash should itself come with some civil solution.
Edit: actually I will walk away as I don't have a solution and don't want to be part in Shit storm that might happened here, but I do recognize now that bitcoin cash name might be misleading to new users.
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:53:16
Check [this]( site.
You should have it confirmed quite soon actually.
I have sent transaction with ten times bigger fee and was waiting for nearly 48 hours, but it looks like this weekend was very lucky for you as fees are lower now.
edit: your fee was 24.146 sat/B 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:52
Like what?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:34
Atomic swaps are possible without segwit and already tested on bitcoin cash.
Edit: miners support most profitable chain.
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:10:28
It is worring. There is no known reason for such a sharp rise in few days. It might not end well. I just stopped using btc for a while.
Am I missing something? What is going on?
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:01:09
That is one I was waiting for so the witchhunt can begin.
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:01:22
Wishful thinking mostly. Plenty of lunatics here. 
Btc brought new and superb idea to this world but for last 5 years nothing really improved. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:44:42
No, not really. I just gave up and move somewhere else where I can have a chat.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:31:40
More like wtf? Watch it and tell me would you show this to serious person? I wouldn't.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:58:00
So far brave only asked me for btc not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:21:05
No sorry. I am with btc nearly from beginning as I was working on torrent implementation for years and as it happens same community was also intetested in blockchain. I am far from new.
Problems I have however with this recent rise are probably beyond your understanding.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:00:52
Me? I am not pessimistic. Bill should be though. 
Btc has more than just technical problems and all of them (including technical), sure, can be sorted but I doubt they WILL. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:36:11
Easy. One big tech problem and all goes tits up. That can be anything we don't know yet. Problems with segwit, hard fork wrong way, you name it. Bottom line is btc is high risk commodity.
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:07:32
No it is not that easy. Most of reputable gambling sites will only allow you to withdraw via channel you used to deposit. Shady ones...well, are shady. You've been warned.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:36:39
Samourai is samourai. Bitcoin is bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash. Have some respect and grow up. 
Don't be troll.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:23:49
I use Ledger Nano as a wallet.
I also use Mycelium on mobile (and ledger) to buy btc for cash. 
Bitsquare looks promising but I can't vouch for it just yet.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:21:51
It is stupid. I basically stopped using btc due to recent steady price increase. What is the point of buying things with btc and make profit by selling it foe cash if all I actually have to do is hold my btc. I got so lazy.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:42:05
Its gone forever. Sorry mate.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:03:55
Nope. All is clear for me here now. 
Doesn't mean core devs are right.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:18:41
Well known and very positive for traders. Good chance to buy bitcoin cash on lower price.
 
Still quite strange approach as I bet some users would rather keep bitcoin cash than have it converted to bitcoin especially without any say of selling price or simply sell when ready to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:17:40
That is why I always say that bitcoin is already centralized.
Bitcoin was supposed to grow in all areas at similar pace. Difficulty, adoption, block size to start. Unfortunately, years ago with introduction of Asic, bitcoin changed a lot.
edit: little brain fart corrected
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:45:31
I don't know about bcash but bitcoin cash certainly has a future and definitely has its own sub.
Try its name or bitcoin airdrops.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:46:07
Ohh shit man. I can't even comment that as I am gutted. Please read what you wrote and tell me is that what you want from bitcoin? 
Saying that, you are absolutely right. And no, I am not obviously in line with the community. 
Thanks for your comment. It was very important for me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:39:22
Bitcoin classic is bitcoin cash or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:32:25
No, almost because encryption is solid.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:47:49
Good read and oddly a lot of bitcoin and cash close together. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:11:57
There is no hacker only cover up.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:11:16
Bitcoin was supposed to grow with technology and 1mb limit was supposed to be temporary. 
Yes, every increase of block size carry some risk but technology gets better every month and can help us mitigate risk.
Hard drive sizes are increasing for same money. Broadband is getting faster. We should at least get starting testing bigger blocks not clinge to 1mb block size.
Block stream as far as I understand wants to keep 1mb and scale off chain.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:05:31
Just use bitcoin core software and you will stay on 1mb chain without loss. Make sure that your recipient/sender also use bitcoin core and you are good to go.
It shouldn't be a disaster and probably things will calm quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:33:52
Are you aware people were asking similar questions when btc was for £10?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:09:41
Relaying node is a good start. Full mining node is  even better however not cost effective.
Use bitcoin if you can too. 
Good method I heard is buying btc to the amount of planned purchase and then buying actual physical item. You might even gain by waiting for price of btc going up and in effect spending less on desired item.
In times like now with high fees, just hold and don't panic.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:02:43
I think £50000 per satoshi would clearly indicate we are about to hit crisis.
Just wait...what year is it? 2121? Shit, stop looking into the future. That's awkward.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:48:54
Wish you all the best.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:52:56
I would also like to add to above
3.) Get yourself good book about bitcoin to educate yourself. I recommend Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:59:54
It isn't irresponsible as it suppose to replace old 1mb chain not to live next to it. That was whole idea of the agreement.
Edit: well, maybe not whole idea as it was also to  remedy scaling issues in a way that satisfy most.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:40:36
Exactly, please op explain.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:18:32
It will not. Bitcoin will just be abandoned by some who will move to different projects while block stream gets bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:18:44
I'll bring popcorn to watch all concern trolls expressing their sadness for your loss and directing anger at Bitcoin.com.
I wouldn't made it up better. All fits.
edit: at least show transaction, please.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:53:13
That's the old one.
Where and how you dumped addresses?
Was it latest core wallet?
Edit: I've seen your other posts. Just try to take wallet.DAT to new core wallet and use dumpwallet command to create file with unencrypted addresses with privkeys.
You can also try dump just one address you need.
And back up old wallet of course before doing any thing.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:54:53
Whitout /s it would be more clear what you want to say. With /s I can't follow, sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:13:53
Not me but bloke above was being down voted, besides private key is all one need and no password will help you unless trezor is magic.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:29:25
Basically all you said was nonsense and not technically correct, but I have no time for you. Only correct thing in this pile is bitcoin has segwit. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:48:16
Why the correct answer being downvoted?
Guys, private key is all one need.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:36:32
Well, I think you are right I ought to withdraw from commenting when I have no intention to discuss issues. 
Every sentence you wrote was incorrect. I just can't...I won't comment anymore.
Sorry for commenting your post.
Take care.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:59:05
Use bitcoin cash or litecoin next time instead of bitcoin as the latter has been crippled with small 1mb blocks which results in high fees. All in the name of decentralization which is already gone thanks to asic and centralized mining.
But hey, at least block stream will profit from side chains, yay.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:09:03
I agree with you completely. 
But don't worry, nothing will happened, just avoid using bitcoin near fork just in case. Your btc are safe.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:39:32
This is not a forum for bitcoin cash, but for bitcoin. However I can't stand those bullshit people are feeding here. Bitcoin cash is as centralized as bitcoin is. Not much different at least now. It might change in the future, but for now it is how it is.
Bitcoin cash actually have very big pool of developers working in separate teams and solo.
Yes, there are few people highly involved with bitcoin cash that are...off, but same was said about bitcoin side.
I use both btc and bch and have no reason to shit on any of those.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:09:14
It is actually very good question believe it or not.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:54:35
Basically thanks to asic we have different definition of full node now. In the past full node was a miner too, while now full node is actually only relay node without mining function.
Mining is highly centralized and whole debate about keeping small blocks to allow masses to run "full nodes" is comical.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:54:43
There is nothing to indicate tether will be find out in that time frame. Bitfinex can print money for years before collapse.
I share your sentiment, but your timing is most likely inaccurate. Unless you know something so please do share.
Edit: P. S. Besides, if not tether than still there is iota. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:50:09
Hmm, by the end of 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:31:52
It is not about bigger blocks but more about big fees.
Something has to be done about it. Plan was for segwit and 2mb soon after and many people were planning accordingly.
After segwit suddenly 2mb got opposed till finally postponed, people start to plan differently.
Don't worry though. Bitcoin was dying several times already.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:54:12
That's what I suspect too. Its just to much like already directing discussion on certain path, but I might be overreacting.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:50:47
What FUD is that? BCH blocks are small and fees are extremely low. Can someone please correct me?
Besides, what is this name calling? "Clone-coln"? What is that?
I see some commodity trader sniffed opportunity to make money... Pathetic.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:42:16
True. Even I don't believe increasing blocks is remedy for all btc problems.
P.s. where this principle came from? Whose idea is that?
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:02:10
"They" are changing EDA in few  hours so your theory doesn't make sense. Just try to keep up.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:38:20
Besides, such a quantum computer would state much bigger threat to whole financial system, not only bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:01:13
OK. Thank you for your insight.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:40:27
I don't agree with you. There should be always small room for no fee tx.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:44:52
Hey, because they want to be sure that tx will go through.
10 sat/byte is enough, but what if it might not be soon after sending btc? It is horrible watching how probability of being included in the next block is drifting away.
People sometimes are sending btc with high fees for a reason!
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:44:06
True, but I wouldn't do it better. Would you?
It worked just but enough.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:59:31
So what we are talking about it? It means nothing.
 Crypto world is unregulated and nobody is doing audits.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:37:23
True, but on every sub/forum you will find petty and vile people. It is just question to yourself do you want to address those sort of audience?
If yes, than feel free to do so, but please remember in this case it doesn't benefit bitcoin which urgently needs better quality debate.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:26:31
We have split.
 It is not the best outcome but fairly better than that stupid and divisive civil war we have had recently. If Roger Ver did indeed rob Bch supporters (me included) then that only confirms how harmful situation it was and how many dangerous people with malicious intents circle around btc (and bch now).
However, as much as nobody like to lose money, for providing me alternative, R.Ver please do take my money.
 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:29:49
Lovely demands, but can you support wallet devs? Maybe some fundraising?
Edit "We need to...". No, you want them to do the work so you can benefit from it. I guess segwit will come but rushing devs is not nice.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:41:07
You are getting close to the core of the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:37:36
I'm the guy with btc and bitcoin cash and I'm not smug at all. 
Let bitcoin go its path and bitcoin cash the other. People will choose what they prefer.
Bitcoin will always be in my heart but I use bitcoin cash for transactions as bitcoin is unusable. Shame, but true.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:18:46
That is a lot of misinformation in one post.
Eda has some unwanted side effects but its purpose was totally different to what you described.
There is no inflation in bitcoin cash just like in bitcoin. You are plainly wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:40:34
OK, you got me absolutely baffled.
Forget about seed or password. I don't care about those. 
I think we are talking about "different" private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:07:32
Nope. I love that sub but I'm sure Cw is not Satoshi. Be serious.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:00:39
Hard to believe. Ask him for different options. Maybe PayPal?
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:31:11
Everybody should read that. Nothing of substance other than this is a hardfork.
However as long as paper wallets from 2009 are still valid, I have nothing against this hardfork.
Rest is gibberish, but please stay with 1mb. I hope bitcoin community will do just that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:32:58
So, did everything go as expected?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:08:48
Don't worry about space or sync. Just make copy of wallet.DAT and relax.
Wallet.DAT contains your addresses with their private keys. This plus wallets passphrase (password) is crucial. Rest is not important.
Edit: there is many ways of getting your bitcoin quickly but I can't stress enough importance of backup. 
Syncing can be done on newer machine or you can even import private keys to some light wallet, but backup is first and the most important. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:33:32
Bitcoin is fine and no hard fork happened this month.
Bitcoin cash hard forked Monday, but that is different story.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:38:25
Ledger is your best bet really if you are not comfortable with making paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:35:12
Confiscating funds suspected to have ties with crypto currencies might definitely do it mate.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:50:27

I agree with you and I was trying to convey same message on different forum few days ago.
Live long and prosper :)

External attacker my ass.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:59:14
Because it will help other Cryptos grow. Bitcoin is not the best, just most known to masses.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:01:41
Yes I do know how hd wallet work, but you seems to be lost a little. Difference is that wallet no longer randomly generate private key and address but derive it from master seed and you know that from what I understand.


I think I know what you want to say but this is the moment we are going different ways I reckon.
Once I'll obtain private key to unspent input I am in control of bitcoin no matter how you obtained this private key and no password will help you.
I am afraid we are arguing about different things.
Edit: unless there is something in trezor technology that changes that, but those are basic rules of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:42:26
People are taking a piss saying it will be ready in 18 months just like 18 months ago, but truth is, when it will be ready it will be ready. Not sooner.
Besides, if it is really so awesome it will be worth to wait.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:22:33
I promised myself I will not take part in btc/bch debate anymore, but  man you are talking bollocks.
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:56:15
You are so funny :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:28:41
You hit the nail in the head. Bitcoin is so centralized you know very well it is impossible for me to build miner capable to achieve what you described.
Bitcoin is project that failed in almost every area it promised to deliver and has been crippled. That's my opinion. You may very well disagree, but please spare me stupid comments like the one you left.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:02:22
Optimistic approach indeed and I honestly doubt you are right, but I wouldn't mind being proven wrong. 
Time will tell I guess.
I wish bitcoin bright future and I will definitely not stand in its way.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:29:20
I am deeply against segwit and for this reason alone I favour bitcoin cash. Although I am aware that increasing blocks is not the only solution for scalability and you have a lot of right in what you wrote, you also miss a point. 
Bitcoin is following the path I will not.
Bitcoin cash has potential. It doesn't mean it is free of problems.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:39:03
All true, but read please ops question.
We are talking about theoretical situation not about how to do it. I don't have trezor but I assume it is possible to check addresses corresponding private keys and those stolen are enough.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:46:38
Bitcoin is crippled by blockstream that keeps small blocks to promote side chains idea from which block stream can profit.
There are better Cryptos than bitcoin, but bitcoin is widely known and currently in bubble.
Fees will only get higher.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:47:11
Mate, I don't want to be rude, honestly.
You pointed me to some website that is using word inflation and I should comment that? There is no inflation in btc or bch as limit is 21 millions. Period.
It is possible word inflation is being used there to describe increase of mined coins, which is faster in bch chain than btc, but that by no means is inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:58:22
Seriously, "creating new money" is not an inflation. It can lead to that in normal currencies due to increasing amount of money therefore reducing its buying power. It doesn't happen like that in crypto especially in btc and bch. In fact bch purchasing power has increased. Btc dropped but not due to inflation.
Come on. Do the basic economy. Even Wikipedia ought to help you. It is not me using word inflation wrong.
Edit: I'm not denying bch chain is longer.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:40:15
Do you believe this is true? Although I don't mind other solutions than only increasing block size, I reckon small and carefully implemented increase of block size would be beneficial for bitcoin.
Honestly, I am not entirely happy bitcoin cash is increasing its popularity because of block increase as I don't trust people behind bitcoin cash.
I consider 2mb rebuke as a mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:10:28
Ouch..relax mate. Good post, but a little overwhelming I need to admit.
Without going into much depth, I would rather go for slow ride with bitcoin core team and slow controlled block increase, which is not I admit only scaling solution, than trust bitcoin cash team and its uncontrollable block increase to God know where and God know how fast.
Saying that, I don't believe off chain transactions is the way to go. I might be wrong, but what is obvious to you is not to me and I don't do politics now.
I guess we will see and I am not being sarcastic and mean as I am **bitcoin** user.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:41:41
Because you will have to pay 2000 satoshi or more fee to use 20 satoshi paper wallet.
Unless you just want to use it as a note and that can happen.
Edit: 2000 - 200000 satoshi fee per transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:14:52
Who do you try to fool?
Bitcoin fees are crippling without doubt. I can't use it anymore, sorry. It is just not viable to pay for money move so much.
Last Sunday I turned off my bitcoin node and I'm off. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:42:46
Mate, what a bollocks. It is nothing like bitcoin chain and not even similar reason of problem.
On bch chain 1sat/byte transactions are going without problem and people are discussing some bug when setting fees. I personally set fees manually and never had any issue, but it doesn't mean everything is flawless.
In bitcoin I let programs set quite high fee, by many considered to high, but I just need my money to move without shadow of doubt. 
Those are not to high fees for me, just necessity.
Whole ops post title is misleading.
Edit: actually I should write bitcoin part in past tense as I stopped using bitcoin recently, but that is different story.

Ledger or trezor on windows should suffice.
Linux can be even more dangerous if you will be targeted as new users usually don't protect their os enough.
Seriously, get yourself ledger and don't worry to much.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:09:08
Don't worry about it. Both btc and bch will be OK. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:04:22
In what terms?
Use? I'm sure of it.
Price? If btc not improve fees situation, bitcoin cash will overtake bitcoin probably.
I wouldn't be to worry about bitcoin but I'm happy with competition it gets from bitcoin cash.
P.s. funny how suddenly it is bitcoin cash not bcash :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:35:17
If you believe there is pump coming to bch why not benefit from that?
Anyway, what does it have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:06:01
That comes from a guy who few days ago was taking a piss of 1mb chain on forum. Hmm. Both supporter and troll?

And the name calling has began....again. Oh children, behave.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:23:40
Yes we can. We don't have to though and I understand that.
That is why I am happy with btc getting no 2x blocks and bitcoin cash getting into big blocks.

@_date: 2018-02-11 07:46:58
Will it in any way invalidate what I wrote if I will not do that?
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:47:26
Your last comment is just above mine.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:24:58
I'm sorry I didn't respond quicker but I didn't notice your comment.
Can you point me please where I am shilling anything you useless dumb fuck?
 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:46:39
I disagree. Bch brought long needed peace. There was to much attacks between different visions. Now you can simple choose which chain to follow. Miners will find an equilibrium.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:42:46
Doubt it. People there are smarter on average.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:59:03
Should have start sentence with bcash and idiots would have no doubts you are one of them.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:25:14
He is not my boss. 
Is defaming a websites mandatory in here or else you are being called rogers employee? Or inferred to be one?
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:26:38
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:11:30
Oh yes. That's why that split was beautiful. It actually helped everybody in my opinion.
I still own btc, just I see big opportunity in bitcoin cash in next few days. Again in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:50:10
There is nothing to justify.
When you buy you have to have strategy.
If it is long game you shouldn't care about dip as what is important is price at the end. For example in 5 years or whatever you chooses at the beginning.
If you are short time investor or day trader you should have had sold soon after 15% loss and move on. Everything else is pretty much stupidity.
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:34:18
That's £100 you will not see again.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:40:33
You took few of mine words out of context in your previous post. Do you understand that?
I also explained why I did that and that I don't have to follow it up and why.
Please read my post again and try to compute, dear god.
Edit: I'll update my original post to make it more clear for you.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:20:56
What coin? What kids? What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:59:59
Check both. This sub very often avoid hard questions and bans people for little to nothing.
I understand banning trolls, but just to kill discussions raises red flags for me.
Btc sub is not about bitcoin cash although it seems to be hijacked by its supporters.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:47:54
I hope so. I hope I will get called out and I hope somebody will point where exactly I'm shilling anything.
Like where?
In my opinion samourai guys are not right.
You have to make a distinction between not liking something or somebody and outright lying that something is scam.
Unless it is scam, but then enlighten me please because obviously I'm missing something.
Edit: or are you telling me I can't have my opinion because samourai devs are right? I'm lost here.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:33:46
No need for /s. This is kind of true ...
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:42:38
You so old now?
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:44:28
So what was first? Egg or chicken?
I remember it differently, however I would like to know difference between strict moderation and killing valid questions. Actually, after second thought, I don't.
 There is no point to argue about details now especially here, as this is not the place for that anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:59:35
One question.
Have you made at least one btc transaction face to face with a stranger?
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:40:52
I was talking about face to face transactions.
We will meet in public space and you will take out phone/laptop, send me btc and I will walk away and you will not be able to proof anything.
You want to call police? OK no problem. I can wait as I don't know what you talk about.
With cash first situation is different as you have witnesses (maybe even camera recording) in public area that you handed cash. You can always call cops to at least get money back.
Edit: ffs don't even mention PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:30:04
Yes. Even more if you send it to me. I can send you profit after 4 months so you can reinvest for last 2 to gain even more. But don't tell it to anybody as this is secret that only the best know. Are you ready to join the best of the best?
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:53:00


OK, I'm out.
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:17:06
You will end up with no bitcoin and no bitcoin cash I'm afraid.
Take your time and try to learn more about it. You can do it. No rush. In fact, time is your friend as both btc and bch are going up.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:57:40
I'm happy you shared this with me and I have nothing against what you think. It was well written and informative too.
There is problem with name, I don't deny it and I don't have solution for it, but creating "bcash" name and adding negative connotation to it was very low and carries consequence.
Using that name is offensive now and rude. You can not care about it of course, but you will become rude at least.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:43:05
I know, exab shouldn't be trusted.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:45:40
Ha. You see, bitcoin.com is a website with working software. That is not promoting it but stating facts.
There is plenty liars here though and you are one of them by calling mentioned website (and wallet) a scam.
Just like leaving negative reviews for bitcoin.com only because you don't like it and not because is not functioning properly is a misleading and petty.
Most of current users in r/bitcoin are now just like that. Petty. That's a cancer that drags bitcoin down.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:07:17


Depends on what level and intended by whom.


It was never suppose to be 1mb and adding rest of this babble that followed after quoted sentence made it very hard to read. 
This is not debate about big blocks and I understand bitcoin goes with 1mb path towards layers, but please don't mention this nonsense about centralization when already bitcoins network is highly centralized to few big miners.


I'm going to be rude for a moment but fuck Roger. Don't even mention him as I already have high pressure.
But I agree with you on the rest and that is why I said that Bitcoin failed stress test. Blockchain is not efficient payment network. Exactly. At lest not with 1mb blocks. 


This make sense, but it doesn't change the fact that bitcoin failed or is failing in current form. Not the security. That was maintained, yes. I'll wait for LN before I even try to come back to bitcoin. 


And that is vision I want to see in action. I have my doubts I am not going to lie, but I want to see that.
It is not the only way in my opinion though.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:57:04


I stopped reading here. Sorry. Bitcoin was suppose to be with low or no fee. That was fundamentals at the very beginning. If I remember it correctly those are pretty much same words as they were on bitcoin.org for long time. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:29:56
Well that is loads of bollocks. Problem with censorship was here long before bcc or any unlimited or whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:53:33
Simply because more and more users is asking me do I accept bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin?
I have got no problem with bitcoin cash so answer is yes. Are they just unloading "free" bitcoin cash? I don't know, but more people is getting aware of bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:11:09
I think I already proofed that what you are saying is nonsense. $50 fees not much? End of story.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:40:43
Really? Did I lie in here somewhere? 
You did. Disgusting.
P.s.  roger, he is not my friend.

@_date: 2018-02-02 07:14:01
Everybody knows already I sold at around £15000 and I never was hiding how happy I was with my timing.
I also told them not to buy because of tether and fees. They didn't listen.
Monday will be lovely day as all of them will here from me "I'll told you so".
Happy days because of that.

I wonder what data you have.
Crypto s p.z.o.o is a limited company with 5000  zloty capital :) so good luck.
Bank spóldzielczy is just a bank. I have no idea what connection both Crypto company and bank spoldzielczy have to cex.io though.

At least you can use word hold properly. I guess you are the intelligent one.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:12:39
So are you. What is this shit about signing got to do with fees? Fuck you too you twat.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:49:06
I don't really know what you want to say. I pay about £1 for every £100 sending abroad, but why you talk about that?
Edit: and get it next day if that is important.
Bitcoin was suppose to have little or no fee.
From very beginning that was one of it foundation.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:50:46
I'm not negating that. There is plenty of ways to solve scaling issues and increasing blocksize is only one of them and I'm not advocating here that it is the best way.
All I'm saying is your original post was far from true.
@_date: 2017-09-22 03:16:01
Well done. Finally someone has a good grip on it.
Bitcoin is a marvelous idea that will and is changing world, but bitcoin itself will be left behind.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:57:19
I think I explained already in what way bitcoin failed.
You responded to it with long text which part I found interesting, quoted it with my thoughts and now you are asking same question. We are going in circles.
Full nodes are mining nodes too. Relay nodes are not that important. They validate and relay, but full nodes do that to. It is also funny how terminology has changed over the years.
You don't have to convince me to bitcoin. I'm sold already and have been for years. 
But OK, bitcoin failed as it couldn't provide me its functionality without increasing fees significantly. I understand it was necessary from security point of few and that aspect wasn't affected, but only because block is so small, fees had to go so much up. I understand currently bitcoin supporters want to keep 1mb block while waiting for second layer, OK, I've got no problem with that, but current model failed.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:13:18
I don't have to. I was talking about your mum kid.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:28:20
Its really shame that special privilege for old coins had been removed. Even small part of block could be used for 0 fee privileged old coins and that couldn't be use as spam or at least its potential for spam would be limited not only by low part of block but also by time.
I don't really understood explanation why old coin privilege has been removed.
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:07:20
Of course.
Just buy £100 worth btc and prepare to be millionaire in 2021.
Just hodl hodl hodl.
I hope it is obvious I'm being sarcastic...
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:26:32
No no no. In normal item to cash deals I would agree with you in a heartbeat. In btc world you talk rubbish.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:15:36
Absolutely fantastic read. Bloke really gave very good arguments and only got hate and anger from bitcoin community.
Unbelievable. 
Edit: it is nice to see that somebody recognised that btc is a fork with segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:11:34
Hm, I think I understand your logic and it is not stupid I admit.
Whether we should solve problems in one layer or more is debatable, but I hope LN will shed some light on that matter.  
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:27:28
There were few situations in the past that caused sudden price drop. One of them was mt.gox exchange that supposedly got hacked.
Personal fun fact: I checked yesterday that I lost at mtgox 1.91btc and back then I didn't worry about this "change" to much. Now I wouldn't mind getting it back :)
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:42:05
You just have been established as a liar in different post.
Disgusting scam you are.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:50:48
He is lying to you.
Bitcoin.com is not scamming site. You can use their wallet for bitcoin without problems.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:15:23
Why not use bitcoin with bigger blocks and lower fees and for small transactions too? Because bigger blocks takes security away? Really?
So what if I tell you that segwit takes security away too? Don't believe me of course, just read about it and don't settle for bitcoin only for high value transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:54:23
This. Ledger nano is awesome and I recommend it to everybody (especially still using windows 10), but paper wallet is good enough for start.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:50:10
There is nothing to justify.
When you buy you have to have strategy.
If it is long game you shouldn't care about dip as what is important is price at the end. For example in 5 years or whatever you chooses at the beginning.

@_date: 2017-10-06 17:37:02
Openbazaar is great. I love it and recent addition (tor) made it even better.
Only thing that holds openbazaar down now is ironically bitcoin itself or, to be more specific, bitcoin fees.
Segwit + 2mb block was an agreement born in compromise to deal with fees problem. It is not a fud.
Some people are just stupid enough these days to honor agreements.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:33:55
OK mate. Let's call it a day. You don't see a difference, OK. Walk away as I do same now. Bye and no hard feelings.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:40:40
I know exactly how they are calculated, do you?
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:16:06


It failed here exactly as it was supposed to be no or very low fee to use bitcoin.
I couldn't use bitcoin to sell items anymore. I had to drop bitcoin and try to find different solution.
It doesn't mean bitcoin is finished or dead, but definitely needs improvements which I wait for. 
Everything else I agree with you.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:09:58
Where is this $40 mate? Its not much, isnt it?
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:18:03
Is that enough to be shill?
Madness or stupidity?
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:17:11
Nice. I am very happy to see this as it gives me new hope for btc future. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:42:33
I doubt anything like you said will happen unless fee problem will be sorted for good. With bitcoin value $50000 average fee would be what? $50? No chance for bitcoin to have any use then, not to mention climbing.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:10:54
Even with consensus is dangerous.
What if most will agree to roll back my latest transaction in which I was moving my life savings? 
Fork should be a split, like happen lately in bitcoin when bitcoin cash went one way and bitcoin the other with different set of rules and user can follow one of choice.
A power to have a rollback is frightening even with consensus.   
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:01:56
Omg really? So basically x2 is bad because bitcoin with it would be used more and people would not "hodl" so much anymore!?!
Who wrote that? If that is the position of bitcoin "user" then I have nothing to add.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:06:44
I admit I didn't check the website yet but idea is quite good.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:24:37
Well, I look at Jeff's metronome as an attempt to smooth bitcoins fork and price vulnerability. Is it necessary? I don't know, but looking at the shitshow with big blocks and nya segwit2x agreement his approach is interesting.
Don't get me wrong, I try to be unbiased but clearly hijacking bitcoin by one company is not healthy.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:56:45
Probably, maybe.
I hope I will leave long enough to see did more layers work or was it bad idea.
Meanwhile it is wrong to assume all is fine and all is working as intended. It is not.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:23:59
There you go. 
I have already leaked to much information on this account and soon I will abandon it.
However, I have been selling btc in London, Gdansk and Warsaw and once in Magdeburg even before I had any mobile wallet. I have never been a victim of anybody but I have had few close calls. Especially in fucking London where people are just scums.
I will never ever send you bitcoin without cash first. It can be half but that's about as far as I can budge. I can wait for confirmation if you want but rarely anybody ask for that. In transaction details it is clear was fee sufficient or not.
People are strange and rude but quite quickly you can see who you dealing with. 
I will repeat myself but here we go. Send me bitcoins first and I will walk away and there is nothing you can do about it.
Edit: your personal experience is important as I could clearly see you don't know what you talk about.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:44:21
Nah, just wait or it to drop more.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:31:57
Popcorn ready.
Edit: do come to btc sub for some answers, you won't get them here. While there try to avoid anti core posts as some there are rather visious, but more info there. I would be very surprised to get unbiased answer on bitcoin sub about what you ask.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:29:49
Whose we? Core? Blockstream? People? What are you on about?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:08
Of course it will. Eventually.
Correct question is when.
It might be weeks, months or years but it will get there.
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:45:44
You don't have to download whole block chain to find out what you have there on your wallet.
I'm sorry I can't help you at the moment.
Check dumpwallet and dumprivkey commands you can use in bitcoin core wallet. Read about it and take your time. There is no rush really.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:49:08
Still can be reversed via your bank just by claiming your credit card has been stolen or fraud. Keep clear from PayPal as it doesn't go well with btc.
Op is probably a scammer or really new.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:12:29
And what keeps me away from ETH.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:18:27
That would be ideal, but in practice unachievable. There will be always the odd one. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:04:12
Yes, true. But sending salary to an employees could be really costly. Unless they earn 100k.
Jokes aside, fees are needed, but current fees will prevent bitcoin ever getting to 100k.  Currently at least.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:32:51
It is not. Don't worry. It is not the first time for bitcoin and not the last. 
Concentrate on adoption of bitcoin, use it and you will see it recover sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:06:02
How to destroy something you can't stop?
Cripple it.
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:39:22
Lol. Don't send btc first. Cash first.
How many transactions you have done and where you find those fools?
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:00:06
First send me $50 for transaction fee, as you know, it ain't much for you...
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:49:26
No need for that. I'll check it myself as soon as I get home. I have nothing against being corrected.
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:31:33
Is it even possible?
I can't check it now but minimum is 0.00001000.

Or use dumpwallet.
Same outcome little bit faster.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:52:50
I use electrum, but bitcoin.com works well too.
I'm shocked of comments in this thread. Absolutely shambles.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:23:05
Yes. I stated it very clearly on number of occasions and on few subs (!!!). How about that?
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:52:52
I'm sorry I don't understand. 
I doubt 2x can be simply ignored. Even if you will be using own node and connect only to core nodes eventually you will run into obstacles.
Miners are very important. Relaying nodes are doing just that - relay.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:05:56
To be honest I am a little out of the loop currently, but if what was written there is true, I wouldn't touch bitcoin gold with a bargepole.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:18:03
I'm not saying they are better or not.
I'm talking about bitcoin and crypto in general. You need to understand this is very dangerous and volatile area especially for non skilled people. Possibility of losing serious money is great but greed you could pump would be to great hence ban.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:02:13
Actually you will be able to see everything in bitcoin core, but if wallet.DAT is encrypted you will not be able to decrypt it without passphrase therefore no way to make any transaction or extract private keys. Still, check it as many rogue botnets had no encryption for their wallets.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:23:11
As far I understand alts don't share same blocks at any point that's why they are not forks really. Bitcoin cash is a perfect example of forking from bitcoin. Coins pre fork time exist on both chains only go with different ledger from fork point time.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:32:45
I think that too.
Just every time I mentioned that everybody yell "fud fud".
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:53:47
I should explained it, but I don't have to especially when I see I'm surrounded by very biased people unwilling to pick up conversation.
It is OK to say that you don't agree with somebody or something, but it doesn't mean you have to jump straight away to explanation what and why.
Heavy and quick down votes tolled me to better not explain further my initial statement.
Edit: quick explanation:
In my opinion samourai dev is wrong as I see bch fork totally different and struggle about name I also see totally different. A lot can be written about that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:54:07
I don't really know what you want to say.
User that started thread you linked to is troll that constantly shit on bitcoin cash there and is not helping anybody in any community.
Just read few of his posts and you will get the gist.
Edit: besides, what does you link have to do with btc?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:28:46
This is money. Be serious.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:19:57
OK, I understand that and agree.
How does it make bitcoin.com scammy site?
I'm using bitcoin.com wallet too so am I being scammed somehow?
Word of warning is different than calling it scam.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:07:05
Mining power was always in flux. Bch appearance was a major distortion, but it slowly losing its significance. Relax. 
I dare to say on this sub that bitcoin cash fork was beneficial in general for bitcoin and by far less dangerous then upcoming 2x drama. Even if fork bring bad publicity and confuses new users.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:10:09
Eh, you are right. I just checked newest submissions on btc and they are about bitcoin cash  or Luke and his view of bitcoin painted in negative way.
That's not very good and there is no filter I know about. 
Saying that, IMHO, when I have doubts or questions I would like to talk about, btc is more likely to give me proper discussion, while bitcoin sub is filled with dumb hodlers who don't know anything other than current price.
People on bitcoin sub who know a lot about bitcoin are not prone to have discussion probably because they are tired of constant fud.
Besides, I usually don't ask here as I don't want to get ban.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:46:00
I must be mad than as all I can see are meaningless topics and useless posts. In top we have some price thread and all I can say is hodl hodl hodl. Oh. Its yours.
To avoid further unnecessary discussion I'll keep it short.
Quality of this sub is lower than btc one because of overly strict moderation on bitcoin sub. IMHO. 
And I am definitely bitcoin supporter.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:42:39
Sweeping is making transaction. Two paper wallets equals two transactions.
Don't worry about fees  too much. Just use paper wallet once. Don't collect multiple inputs in one paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:08:32
Those paragraphs were boring and so bland.
Your first two words were enough to lose interest anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:28:18
I don't understand why you asking me this. How does it help?
Although fees are not directly connected to amount btc transferred, but to block space taken, with current fees mechanism 100000 will not be achieved ever.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:21:17
China banned ICO yesterday and that cause massive money withdrawal. Many inexperienced investors not understanding what is happening is also trying to get away to cash or at least away from speculative alts.
Try to research more about tether and ICO and you will get basic idea what is going on. 
Edit and post scriptum: although bitcoin is being drag down I reckon it will be OK in few months if not sooner.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:57:42
I'm OK with fees, as long as they are low. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:55:08
I support many coins, honestly, but I don't come here to talk about it as this is not the forum about it. Calling me shill because I visit (!) different subs is insane.
I don't support bcash as there is no such coin. Sorry mate.
You are cancer to bitcoin community that kills discussion and hinder bitcoin growth. Only numbers of idiots like you are growing and that is cancer.

I swear to god, I have no need to convince, convert or intimidate you to any coin. Do what you want.
I will not claim superiority of any coin over any coin.
It is just in here it is very easy to be labeled shill as soon as you don't fit the mold.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:23:10
I often say that bitcoin is not finished product. Some aspects needs improving and luckily that is happening in form of projects you mentioned and more.
Going back to nodes I need to highlight that relay nodes are not full nodes. Full nodes have also mining part while relay node don't.
I hope we agree on that.
Thank you for your texts though. There was a lot of interesting things to read and I appreciate your effort.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:39:12
Hi. 
I don't know did you notice but bitcoin has failed its stress test already when fees were reaching 1000sat/byte and more. 
Until lightning network turns to be effective and working, there is no reason to implement bitcoin in business at least in bigger scale.
Current low level fees and speed is nothing as is not addressing fundamental problems. LN is, but this is not deployed yet.
P.s. trading btc for other coins will not make bitcoin great.
 
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:21:45
Rather simplistic approach.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:48:39

You can't say the same about me. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:07:57
I am planning to do the opposite today. Thanks for the links.

Like I said before, your level is beneath me and I will not have a chat with you anymore. You are not anonymous in here, I know who you are. 
Let's stop here before things get ugly.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:39:25
It should be dropped long before that however even with that low fee it shouldn't be that long.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:42:49
I am not to sure now but I remember that minimum fee limit was set to 0.00001000btc per kilobyte so 1sat per byte. I'm also not sure is it possible to pay less fee and yet pay some fee.
This fact of fees limits, not my hesitation, could probably elevate fees with high bitcoin value in dollars. 
It is unwanted subject here, people rather discard me than correct me. I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong.
So, IMO $100000 unachievable at the moment. We will see how segwit and lightning network help, then maybe, but I don't want to talk about those.
Kim pirate bay dot com is s hype man, and IMHO disgusting man.

Bitcoin is doing great and is not dying. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:05:44
So far yes, still your op is right. You are pumping highly volatile instrument near ath. What do you expect?
Most people lack technical knowledge to have proper discussion even on bitcoin subs not to mention personal finance one.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:31:14
Not really. I am very peaceful person.
User I was responding to crossed the line in the past hence my behaviour.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:37:53

Are you serious? I am not sure are you trolling or are you believe in what you say.
I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just asking for clarification.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:21:19
And nobody is asking you to.
Do what you want, that is fine. I wish you well.
I think I can have different opinion than samourai dev though, or not?
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:09:56
Yep. But there would probably be a retaliation in form of petition to call bitcoin simply bcore. Plenty would sign that.
Both petitions I would think of as stupid and petty. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:03:46
Physical violence.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:25:29
Minimum fee is 1sat/byte. Lower than that is no fee.
But lowest fee is 1sat/byte not 57sat/kilobyte like the person I responded to suggested.
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:13:24
Well written and I agree with you completely. It is refreshing to read. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:31:04
Like I said minimum fee is currently 1sat/byte and that doesn't even guarantee you that tx will be confirmed ever. Yet somehow people dream about $100000 per btc. Not possible.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:10:18


Is that even possible?
Edit: I'm not trying to argue with op. There was bloke here few days ago showing transfer with 1sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:24:51
I don't know the site but if you had to pay something I'm afraid you have been robbed.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:48:16
Jesus, I am nearly crying here. What a loads of bollocks.
You know what? I don't even care anymore about ANY fork, but level of your "insight" is shocking.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:46:18
I'm still talking about you. 
You lied about bitcoin.com in different post. You defamed website. That's a fact.
You can of course not like that website, but you shouldn't lie.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:34:34
Probably. My point is that both petitions would attract shits from both sides.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:11:50
You wrapped it up pretty good.
Don't get me wrong, eth is fascinating, but technically very risky and they didn't handle DAO problem very well.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:06:32
You can't send bitcoins you don't have confirmed yet and that happened in your case.
Look on your low fee transaction. You are trying to spend from unconfirmed input.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:11:25
No, not worth it. It is better to actually buy bitcoin of this worth.
Saying that, if you really want to mine try different coins. I subscribe moneromining sub, but there is plenty other more profitable coins (monero is the one I value though).
Just read before jumping in and have fun.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:11:42
OK. You see, now you are talking sense. It is about bitcoin name.
I'm using bitcoin.com mobile wallet and I love it. I haven't been scammed of anything at least yet, so I assume software is spotless. 
Bcash doesn't exist. If you mean bitcoin cash, by calling it bcash you are lying to people.
So you are just as scammer as guys from bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:12:17
And if you will be able to send 6k for.60 cents when bitcoin price will be $100000 I will have absolutely nothing against that. My worries are that with such a bitcoin value your fee would have to be in region of $60 and that is no good. I understand fees are not directly connected to amount you send but they do seems to no connected to bitcoin fiats value.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:36:46
No, you didn't have them in your wallet.
Check this one from 2017-09-28 07:48:08 
edit: quick look in the past shows you are repeatedly using bitcoin you don't have due to unconfirmed transactions.
My advice wouldn't be taken well in this sub so I am going to stop now. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:52:06
No, I'm not saying that. I was just surprise of people's lack of ability to make simple decisions.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:25:36
UK is actually a problem part as Brit banks will close your account before you spell bitcoin correctly. I would recommend localbitcoins or bittylicious but don't mention bitcoin anywhere in bank transfer description. Plus, prepare to pay premium for being British.
I am actually in Poland now (till tomorrow) and it is cheaper and easier here to sell/buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:10:02
Way better, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:15:55
Good post with good points.
I do see btc flaws. 
I'll be  here, I'll be there. See you around.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:02:53
Try to send such a transactions on daily basis and quickly you'll get my point. Add replace by fee and double spend ready. Hopefully in the future things get better.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:42:24
Sorry mate, it is you that seems to not get it. Bitcoin is new, revoultionary and visionary. It can create new order. Think about it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:16:39
Minimum fee is 1000satoshi per kilobyte mate. Go and check it. Yes, you can send tx with no fee but minimum fee is 0.00001000 per kilobyte. 
My point is, I repeat it again, I'm not sure transaction can be sent with lower than 1sat/byte and yet paying some fee.
Both no fee and minimum fee is unworkable at the moment and with price raise and bitcoin popularity it will become bigger and bigger problem unless addressed.
Edit: you can't have 1kb transaction with total 1 satoshi fee. Don't need to argue, just proof me wrong and I will gladly say you are right.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:05:09


I doubt that but this is irrelevant.


You accused me of being shill for visiting different subs. Now you are contradicting yourself.
Bitcoin.com is not a scam site and you have no grounds to say it is.


I little poor sentence that is hard to answer as I don't know what you are trying to say. Should I try to mimic real coin and then say it is legit? What is real coin?
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:46:07
Well yeah, but it greatly improve the way criminals operate.


Bitcoin helps drug dealers to sell drugs easier over internet. Face it - that is true.

@_date: 2017-10-27 19:19:39
Of course, actually leave it for banks as only they will have seriously  big transactions worthy block space. We normal people should stay with fiat.
Edit: I'm adding this edit as I just realized on this sub many might actually think I'm serious. I was taking a piss.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:31:16
Well, that is the level of discussion I was expecting from you.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:36:31
That is only a problem in highly regulated environment. Inside Islamic state or similar, it would be no problem at all as there is no big brother (at least not yet). 
edit: thank you for links. I am looking at the problem from slightly different angle.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:06:03
Just explain to me one thing please.
If segwit2x was an agreement that as a compromise was supposed to deliver to the bitcoin block chain much hated by some segregated witness feature and also strongly opposed block increase, then why after one side got what they wanted (segwit) suddenly block increase is not needed anymore?
Somehow it doesn't fit into my agreement definition and suggestions on this sub to implement replay protection, points that there is lack of basic understanding in here of what is actually going on.
In summary, my question is who is malicious actor here?
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:13:04
What is this all about?
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:34:18
You seems to be an idiot dude.
Is there anywhere I was or am promoting anything here?
Simple question.
You are useless cancer that kills any discussion with your accusations and you are one of the reasons of bitcoin troubles.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:02:12
So you understand segwit and "other improvemnts and upgrades" and yet you don't see scalability issues?
I don't have my own theory about segwit, but I am avoiding this subject as I think is only fair to direct you elsewhere for unbiased opinion. My biased opinion wouldn't start robust discussion here so I'll skip it.
Ha ha :/
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:40:32
51% attack is the last thing bitcoin community should worry about. Explaining you my point about segwit on this sub is probably not the brightest idea. However, just google "segwit explained" and you will have access to number of articles with unbiased (most of the time) explanation and also you will find more about scalability issues you don't even notice.
Please read books too. I can't recommend enough Andreas Antonopoulos. Very good and I think he supports segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:52:26
Not EDA but replay protection was crucial.
2x has no replay protection and it might actually succeed putting core in trouble especially if they try to fork themselves from 2x. 
Fascinating and entertaining.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:35:31
Sell. Cut your loses. You will never get your money back.
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:51:33
Bollocks, I think it is the other way around. Bitcoin is being used less and less and that is driving price down. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:40:08
OK, you need it, so buy it. Price may drop of course, but so are you, who knows....
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:27:27
Actually not and that is my point. Minimum fee is 1000 satoshi per 1kb.
I wouldn't mind have fees like you mentioned.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:58:45
Agree with that. Still, prepare for actions to regulate both bitcoin and internet. 
edit: Sorry, I agree that it would to bad to the world but things mentioned above are grounds to take actions against it (bitcoin and internet).
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:56:23
I reckon it will be worth nothing by then. Way better cryptos are on the horizon.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:01:55
Fair point. 
There are some though who think differently and are opposing cores dirty tactics. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:40:13
It isn't at all. 2x was supposed to be brought to btc as planned and agreed. 
Somebody just got segwit and try to get out from other part of the bargain.
It is not ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:14:14
How about some other much better crypto?
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:40:26
Not very good, upset I think.
Bitcoin even worse as it might go in value (many hopes so) a lot. Imagine that you are building wealth of terrorist. Would you be happy?
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:34:48
In that case I strongly suggest to use in the future hardware wallets like ledger nano or trezor with any light wallet that support it. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:29:10
You can buy second life currency using paypal and than exchange it to bitcoin.
Check VIRWOX
I tried that once long time ago just to check it but it was expensive way of buying bitcoins.

Brain wallets taught me that I don't own bitcoins when don't have private key.
I was using brainwallet that was being shut some time ago and although I still have Passphrase I can't get my coins back. All other brainwallet sites give different outputs for that passphrase.
So, no priv key = no bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:36:00
Buy trezor or ledger nano.
@_date: 2016-05-01 20:20:41

I try to use those the most.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:25:19
Dumpprivkey is a command you can use in bitcoin core wallet. It will write all addresses from wallet.DAT and write them in text file along with corresponding secret keys.
It is highly recommended not to do that in normal circumstances as of course, all your secret keys will be revealed in simple text file.
Edit: bitcoin is a fascinating technology. Buy some book on amazon about it and all addresses will be clear for you. It is wort it. Your bitcoins can wait few more weeks. They are perfectly safe.
@_date: 2016-05-26 05:46:31

Well, I for one will give bcc a chance and hope for its price drop to buy more. In long run it might be easier for me to use bcc than btc as the latter is real pain in the back for too long now.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:45:04
No mass exodus but few people has switched. I don't want name alts but two of my vendors went for privacy coin and few are very happy with one similar to btc. Definitely high fees had longer lasting negative effect on btc.
@_date: 2016-05-14 12:26:27
Thank you very much. Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:01:38
That protects bcc but not btc. Think of bcc like btc without witnessed data. I'm still learning about bcc and I am not sure but you were on good lead.
@_date: 2016-05-26 05:57:07
Thank god. I am actually unhappy that bitcoin has been introduced to public so early. 
To much hype and big flow of unneeded moaners that do not contribute but just make trouble could have been avoided. Bragging about DNM didn't help too.

Segwit2x is much worse than segwit via uasf. Regardless of what I think about them, created uncertainty has reflection in price drop. No surprise here as people are rather informed I would say  more than you it seems. I wouldn't frankly recommend anybody using btc in near future and many people thinks same so they leave. It is not fud I'm afraid.
Btc will bounce back, I'm sure of it, just don't know which one.
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:28:22
Or follow every chain. No value added and yet more to spend. If there will be split, price will tank.
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:56:54
I said it before. I wouldn't be surprise if 1000 be tested by the end of the week.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:31:53
Of course. If everything goes smoothly, btc price will skyrocket. If something goes wrong many might lose btc. Normal user should not take risks in my opinion and sell btc for cash and come back after everything Clears.
@_date: 2017-07-08 21:00:13
True, but those were nothing to btc.
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:46:17
What? Again?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:55:26
Hmm, I don't know really is that true. I have btc running in background along with few other crypto and no problems on normal computer. I didn't check for a while but about 120Gb is nothing these days.

ehh, seen similar pic like 5 years ago, but I don't think it is accurate for btc which is still evolving and unsure of any future.
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:29:41
No. Segwit is irreversible.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:35:36
That is the best way they can do it. Let's be serious and honest. Although there is only small chance of people losing money due to uasf, segwit2x or whatnot, there is a chance for it nevertheless. 
It is only wise to suspend use of btc in that time.
Holders will hold.
Hodlers are to dumb to understand what is going on and only god knows what they will do.
Traders will trade.
Users will switch to more convenient Cryptos as a temporary solution.
Price will fall of course, but that is not coinbase fault.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:52:21
I don't know much about freewallet but it is possible it doesn't really hold btc in addresses you used to receive. Just Like exchanges do.
Plus, your withdrawal has been confirmed.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:23:06
Let's say it here for you. Uasf is barbaric approach to evolution of btc only slightly less than segwit2x.
I hope you will fork yourself out and I hope segwit2x is as big as shit as possible and it will block itself.
What a proper shitshow has been created. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:24:24
So I have 5 btc worth about 250 ltc.
Suddenly I might have 5btc on 1 fork, 5 btc on 2 fork and 5 btc on 3rd fork. 
Quickly I sell all of them in different places to ltc and I now have 750 ltc. 
Something got yo give of course so in order for above not happen btc price at least on 1 fork needs to tank. A lot.
So, what is going to happened to your btc that will stay on weakest chain? 
My advise is - sell you btc NOW and come back when all clears. And sell it to cash. Not Crypto.
Down votes, I am ready :)
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:06:32
It is not 20% discount. You are troll that keeps shouting nonsense.
People are in danger of loosing money near August and that might damage btc  tremendously. There is reason people are selling now and quite serious one.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:26:50
Just download bitcoin core wallet and COPY your wallet.dat to bitcoin wallet directory. When asked should you replace existing one (as there will be new wallet.dat already), confirm.
Now start bitcoin core and you can wait for wallet to synchronize to spend btc, or you can go to console and use dumpprivkey command to write all addresses and corresponding secret keys to a text file. If unsure, check some wiki for how to use Console.
You do have to have passphrase to your wallet if it requires one.
When you dump keys, you can check manually on any chain explorer did those addresses you have secret keys to, have received any btc in the past. Once found such a address you can use pretty much any light wallet or mobile wallet to import address with secret key. Just remember to send everything from imported address to some new address that belongs to you as you might lose change if you chose to spend partially. Having said that, some wallets might mitigate that but I wouldn't risk it.
Tldr: just stay with bitcoin core and you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:03:13
OK, I am sure now you are a troll.

Call it as you wish and do what you want. It is very likely you might profit from that but please don't lie to people.
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:09:13
I use that one, but I reckon it is more expensive solution than localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:33:57
Wow, that is huge for me. 
Edit: removed the question as it is not yet implemented.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:59:39
Every single Crypto will drop with btc. Some will fall more, some less, but I will be very surprise if any Crypto gain some.
@_date: 2016-05-15 23:30:57
No need to take any action. I don't know what fork and what rules you are refering to, but overall ledger wallet (and more important bitcoins in it) will be just fine. If you have features like new addresses for lightning network in mind than yes, probably some update will be needed however I'm not sure is it only going to be related to firmware as I don't know what are ledgers limitation. Anyway, no fork should require any action from end user.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:35:59
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:13:21
Read my posts from beginning. There is no point to repeat myself.
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:11:42
Yep, like this is what I am talking about. :€
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:03:23
Hansa has multi sig escrow for long time but people don't care about their money much so were using alpha. Well, that will pour sense in some.
Edit: sorry, I drifted. 
Ab possible exit has nothing to do with btc price drop. Silk road was foundation of btc for a moment, ab is nothing now to btc.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:48:55
Bitcoin cash might be more of bitcoin than segwit bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:33:43
I'm good, don't worry.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:42:30
Yep. But only if you sum your btc from all forks together :). I am so excited.
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:56:25
Buy because you want to unload at decent price? Cryptos going down till August. To much risks currently to stay at the market.
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:54:45
Who cares about panic sells? There were plenty and always btc came back stronger. 
I worry about possible breaking btc and it becoming useless. Price can drop to near zero and then you will see panic.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:59:45
Again, I don't know anything about freewalet, but such actions are normal even for well established and trusted exchanges. 
Mycelium is different. It actually shows you unspent outputs of your addresses and mycelium (as a company) hasn't got direct access to it.
Point somebody made about importance of possessing private keys is true but not always possible.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:29:26
Yep, and that is worrying, but that is my recommendation for near uasf date.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:15:31
Sorry. I'll stick to buying your books.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:05:45
This, enough said.

It looks like Polish word. Try say it as shtorts, this is closest I can get and to word means something sharp pointed up.

From dnm to genius. Fuck me, what shit you have to sell to judge these days to explain wealth is astonishing. But it works. Crazy.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:37:00
If uasf succeed I am off away from btc for good.

@_date: 2017-07-15 08:24:11
Come on mate. It is not all fud. 
Btc had long power struggle that was more annoying than important, but status quo came to an end. That will be reflected in price of btc and all Cryptos paired with it.
Yes, I do believe price will go up after dust settles but there is a risk of losing money if and when the worst happen. So, it is frankly wise thing to do to temporarily switch to different Crypto or withdraw to cash. Temporary. 
There is no fud. Some people just don't realise the danger and some, on other hand, don't know how to protect themselves so they leave. Wise.
If you keep holding, good on you mate, probably wise thing to do too.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:16:02

@_date: 2017-07-16 18:08:22
Fuck off. I'm the one with crystal ball here :)
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:09:56
Probably it will, but don't you think you should warn about the danger? And I am not talking about price fluctuations. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:28:24
Well. It is actually closer to what I want than btc in my opinion. It is not reckless, I'm surprised with this statement.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:25:36
Perhaps, but because you guarantee it I am sure you know nothing.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:28:28
Why not under 1000 in a week? Can happen.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:48:57
No. Sell now.

@_date: 2016-07-14 18:29:05
I Use it all the time as it is so convenient. Thanks to bitcoins my children steam library has grown big and my csgo collection is getting intresting. 
Lovely to see btc being taken seriously.
Ahh, forgot to mention that whole process is very quick. Instant dare to say.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:57:58
So... how to prepare for what's coming?
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:51:18
Yes, you can replace wallet.dat later, just make sure that when doing that, bitcoin wallet is NOT running.
@_date: 2016-05-16 00:20:41
To move all funds use "!". For your main problem I have no answer just popcorn.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:29:25
You don't have to download whole chain.
Just start bitcoin-qt with your old wallet.dat in place (always make backup) and in console run dumpwallet command.
    dumpwallet wallet.txt
This will dump all your priv keys (!) and corresponding addresses to file wallet.txt. All you have to do is locate this file and view it. As there will be many (edit) addresses listed, you can skip reserved and change and try to pinpoint addresses actually containing btc. Usually those labeled are first suspects. You can use any block chain explorer and take a peek. Once located just import your addresses to any wallet you are using by importing privet key and its desired address.
You might have to decrypt wallet before dumping it to txt file by using
    walletpassphrase
Important!. Be very careful as dumping wallet reveals everything in simple text file.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:36:09
Biggest drop will be before shitshow. Not after. Unless it will be spectacular shitshow (I doubt that) then it will drop some more after too.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:37:13
We have only 1MB blocks in the blockchain right now that can cover about 2000 transactions each. New block is being mined roughly about every 10 minutes (correct me please if I am wrong).
If you want to be in the block as soon possible you should pay higher fee than the most.
So summary
Every 10 minutes there is one block of 1MB that contains about 2000 transactions. If you want to be in it pay high fee. If you are comfortable to wait for the next one, pay a little less. Just don't leave it to luck as way to low fee might not get you to any and you will wait forever. 
Look at 
edit: yes, fees will be lower if/when we will get segwit or block size increase. Or both. Till then fees are rather destined to raise.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:07:48
Just check. There is warning. In red. Nice and visible. Leave mycelium alone, it is decent wallet and don't blame it for users mistakes.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:08:15
Less surprise now. Thanks. 
Plot thickens and I wonder where is it going to take us?
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:18:34
Anyway, that shit like that tells me that bitcoin is a fail.
How normal user can not lose his coins to hackers when even big players can be broken?
Ow yes, you can hide your bitcoins and never use it but that is not its purpose. 
I LOVE the idea of freedom Bitcoin brought, but things a far from good at the moment for average joe.
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:59:52
So what is the point of having them?
Anyway, don't advise people what to do with their money unless you have something to back your view.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:48:02
Again? Jesus, soon somebody will have to explain me explanations.
Btc is broken. Sell it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:01:19
Then do it. If it will not work as you want, you have plenty of time to do something different. Lots of fun though. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:06:30
I agree that if it will sort itself out then price will go up as it will show that btc is strong. However, there is potential for negative outcome regardless of FUDS level. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:19:49
But is it a bad thing? Only final goal matters.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:56:03
I agree with you however I need to add, that in my opinion with technology so new, advance and delicate it is good to go really really slow. Even if that means sacrificing in price, growth and popularity area. That is why I still support core.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:03:48
Again so close to truth and yet far away from reality. There are already rulers in bitcoin and they stop its  evolution. I love the bloke BTW.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:59:57
If you don't have to move btc in near future, cold storage is the answer for you, else I would recommend running your own btc core wallet.
I know ELectrum is a safe place however in light of possible fracas in near future (1st August) I would ask question on which fork Electrum will stay?
edit: Ledger nano is very cheap and quite good.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:01:33
Yes. Sell sell before it collapse. Definitely before 1st of August. Sell sell sell.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:06:06
Rather "no usage" ��
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:23:13
I did few time send whole wallet.DAT encrypted with gpg --symmetric over normal email. Why not? Saying that I would never leave funds for too long on wallet that is "somewhere" ready to be abuse. Even encrypted.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:11:18
You will probably not get it and this is senders fault. 
Ask him to resend it with proper fee.
Use mycelium at android phones.
Edit: to clarify - you did not really receive any btc as transaction is unconfirmed. You need minimum 1 confirmation to be able to spend btc. Fees are to low in this case to get first crucial confirmation. 
Welcome to bitcoin fees problem.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:37:15
Less than that. Sudden increase was from below 1200. I am not saying it will deep again, but this is the direction for the moment.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:10:15
Bittylicious is ok but expensive imo. Saying that, it looks like in uk btc is expensive in general.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:46:36
What do you want to argue with? Man, fees are to high! Do you want to downplay it? Should btc users feel like they are part of elite because they are able  to pay high fees so swallow it and be happy?
Get a grip. Btc has a problem and don't deny it. High fees and bad structure of it is a problem. Don't be deluded.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:36:22
I start to think that this uasf does not really matter as bigger problem has not been sorted years ago. I am talking about mining centralization thanks to ASIC. I am more and more thinking of leaving just symbolic 1 btc on paper wallet and switching to different coin. :(
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:47:10
To own them?
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:13:20
Less people buying btc due to bitmain and hardfork problem at 1st August. Btc has problems. You can wait it out or sell. Many do sell.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:08:32
What is the point submitting video in language most don't understand? On top of that this stinks like invitation to ponzi. Just go buy futurocoin or some similar scam coin.

Google steganography. You welcome.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:00:48
I have paper wallets. I have ledger nano. I also have bitcoin core running on my PC. The last is by far the best option to use btc in volume I do.
There is many options but I was rather surprise by question I replied to.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:26:51
There will be no bitcoin in 2020 if things get even more broken soon.
Sell, sell, sell.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:30:37
I have poster on the wall with address in qr form containing 1btc. Qr code is small part of picture but helps me check quickly amount. That's my little private cocaine. It will be there no matter what price btc will reach. Up or down, because it has symbolic value.
Private key is stored savely elsewhere of course.
I was thinking about steganography, but never had time really and I am content already.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:04:45
I was trolling op. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:41:32
Read it and buy second edition. Books like that are worth paying for. In the end of the day btc is very serious business so don't be a cheapskate and make sure author gets his reward in money.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:26:16
And on which chain that will be?
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:46:22
I did. Most of it. I love bitcoins but there are better altcoins.
I have few btc as they have sentimental value for me.
Otherwise bye, at least till after block split on 1st of August.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:14:09
I have about 3900 GBP in various Cryptos but that changes daily as I use them all the time. I am not a trader or investor and answer two your second question is zero (0). I am sick of all those holders. Cryptos are money, use them or they will never succeed. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:11:54
I am surprised. I have just sent transaction with 197 sat/B and in was included in next block and all under a minute! Even more, I checked transactions in the block and it looks like many of them pay over 700 sat/B!!!!
Somebody is really being ripped off.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:54:08
All the trouble we have now is because there are different concepts how to sort block bottleneck problem. No agreement to solutions gives as huge fees. Welcome to bitcoin. It is not all good.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:37:46
Try running your own node. Make copy of your wallet and use both forks if it will happen. Who knows, maybe even double spend on one of them. Or both. It is going to be exciting I hope.
Use opportunity and abuse network. If it is worthy, it will survive.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:57:42
I checked after your post and it looks you might be right. Current mycelium fees are higher overall than necessary especially the lowest is still very high. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:14:32
Because those were unspend outputs that sender had. Nothing you should worry about however sender should adjust fee to match transaction weight.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:43:46
Yep, I am evil. Your all btc are doomed and your money with it.  Buuuuut, you can sell btc to me. My offer is 500gbp per btc. Deal?  /s
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:12:15
Nah, mycelium is still the best. Just use it with ledger or trezor. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:10:29
You will get it Sunday morning. Don't worry.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:08:42
That hit me too and convinced me that current status benefits him.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:34:00
This. I am, or should I say I was planning to buy some btc closer to that day. Still waiting.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:19:22
It might drop significantly after too. Depends is anybody going to have btc lost in a fork or not.
Massive potential for shitshow. Same time it might be smooth. Not sure.
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:45:29
That is true, however, what if one will keep btc on wallet supporting defeated chain? 
I moved all my bitcoins to core wallet and they going to wait there for the outcome of the 1st of August fracas. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:58:30
This. For a week before and week after 1st of August I will pretend btc doesn’t exist as I want to skip all the drama and potentially massive price fluctuation. I am not a trader so I'll pass and wait for dust to settle.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:49:31
Mycelium is actually pretty good with setting fees. You have option to set priority level and fees will vary but overall high fees are not mycelium fault. 
Bitcoin urgently needs help.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:57:31
It works fine on my ubuntu 14. No problems.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:56:29
Same here. 
Good to know about bug. I'll stay with 14 for a while.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:16:44
Running away from bitcoin as things are getting to serious?
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:40:03
Your wallet shows the money but as unconfirmed or pending. That means you don't have them and can't send them further. Yes, you can be scammed easily at this point as sender can resend the btc with higher fee to somebody else and that will be confirmed before your transaction. That is double spend scam. If you trust the bloke, ask him to resend btc to YOU with higher fee or just wait. Maybe you will get lucky and eventually btc will reach you or transaction will be dropped and btc goes back to the SENDER. Either way this is sender's fuck up.
Edit: your situation is a perfect example why people are running away to alts. Hopefully segwit or block size increase will sort it out.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:23:06
Yep, in ten years ��
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:40:37
We don't know and don't trust any.
I used three exchanges so far.

OK. I should maybe say the best from those I know. I'll check copay. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:56:49
I think thah usually over the weekends there is less transactions and lower fees.

@_date: 2017-06-26 19:43:09
Yep. Don't mention it at all. God forbid in payment reference. Any "coin" and it is trouble. Had this discussion in my ex bank soon after intersango closure.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:17:02
Uasf will fail most likely. Just question how much.
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:58:35
I personally hope uasf will not be successful although I do support segwit. Anyway, you are absolutely right. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:14:33
Not at all. Wishful thinking at best. Quite laughable though.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:12:18
Make sure wallet is fully synced with network. If unsure check you addresses on external source like any block explorer. It might be necessary to rescan/reindex your wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:17:40
I use ledger nano with mycelium. It was cost of about 20gbp. Honestly, not a money compare to value it gives.
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:41:53
So, is it bitsquare or bisq? Is it just a change of name or evolution or rivalry?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:47:20
Seriously, there is very good book "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos where everything is explained perfectly. There will be new version at the end of the month, buy it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:15:53
Bitcoin will always be in our heart but the most important is idea itself. So what there is better coin emerging? That is good thing. Don't panic.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:37:00
That is also true.
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:44:59
Lack of understanding...perhaps. Just not spreading fear.
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:24:11
There is quite few honestly impressive Cryptos out there now. And almost each supporters reckon their is THE one. 
Edit: I liked dancing part.

Well, it is doing something. It was asked, it delivered.
