I’m hoping for a dip to $10K then I’ll buy more.
It’s holiday season, price always goes down holiday season.
Thanks to the panic sellers for opening the opportunity. Hodl till the new year when price flys back to the moon.

It's business as usual here in the UK at the moment. The sky had not fallen in, the country is still moving and things are as normal.
We might be a bunch of unpredictable fools at the moment to the rest of the world but we will come out on top.
Might take 2 years but we will be laughing in the end......
Oh and BTC has nowhere near enough punter awareness here just yet, I'll keep spreading the word along with my fellow BTC enthusiasts but I'm pretty sure the whole of the U.K. has not moved sterling to BTC just yet.

I've been mining for a while now but want to give some network support.
My business moved premises 8 weeks ago so our GEA connection is going in on Monday. Having to drop back to Adsl for a while has been a nightmare.
As soon as I've migrated all our vm's back on site from a friends place over the pond in Dallas and got us working again I'll add an extra node at work. That can have a static IP, unlimited bandwidth and run as a VM on my super fast Supermicro!

Firmware update went through just fine.
I do like the Trezor, a well designed and thought up device.
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:35:22
I'm not complaining .......
Just waiting for five more S7's, going to hash the shit out while I can make good btc.
Hope the price spirals way way up there!
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:05:48
Even though your comment was pretty shitty on my last post before I found this, I'm afraid I have to agree 100% with what you said above.
Especially that the decision is already made and the whole thing is a joke, corruption at its deepest.
Certainly true about btc and buying. I'm stashing purchased, earned and mined big time, no thought about price but when I'm dead and the kids take the wallets, I'm pretty sure it will help them in years to come.
It will work, but it's suppressed because it can't be easily corrupted, by the people that corrupt everything else. We will get there. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:53:37
So forget the vote, will it bear on price? Will it affect the market?

The title made me laugh, dotcom.
Wouldn't it be ironic if Kimdotcom was really satoshi?
Suppose this belongs in showercoins or showerthoughts really.
Makes you think though yeah?

Might not be what you are looking for but our shop accepts Bitcoin, we are a commercial heating store but have a cool range of wifi thermostats for domestic household boilers.
We could arrange international shipping as we ship worldwide.
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:53:27
This will work but wait a while before moving the altcoin back to BTC. If shapeshift liquidity is low, you could get your original bitcoins back.

Even though I see the coaster dude almost daily either up or down it still makes me chuckle ........

We used Woocommerce Bitpay
@_date: 2016-05-20 21:58:38
We use Wordpress and Woocommerce for our store.
The Bitpay payment gateway was a free download.
Works really easily and well.
Take a look if you like.

Fingers crossed things go as expected and the ex rate rises. Also hope a good amount of old mining kit has the plug pulled!
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:46:09
Price is on the rise again, was hoping for a low cost buy today. You could be right!
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:38:56
Ok so liquidity is probably the wrong term to use. More users on the platform is what is needed. Love the Mad Max reference!
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:37:42
I found a list of local currencies and selected GBP.
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:41:23
In the UK here Bank Transfer seems the most common.
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:47:59
Sure they will get there, very early days. I like the decentralised concept.
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:40:19
You pay directly to sellers chose bank account. Coins are locked into the system and released by vendor. Similar to LBC.
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:08:32
I can see your point, im not a day trader. I mine and need to sell small amounts to cover electricity. For me its great. First transaction completed, bills are paid.
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:16:32
For small quantity transactions, its more anonymous than say localbitcoins. As the moderator has to depost btc of value greater than the transaction, its still fairly safe. For true no frills attached transactions a meet up would probably be the no track record approach.
Dont get me wrong, I still have concerns mainly with the fact the platform is new and running in Beta. I only need to discharge small quantities of btc to cover mining electricity so for me this works well.
With the halving only hours away, the amount I have to sell is probably going to hit 1 btc per month so for me this is still ideal.
All I can do I guess is plod on and see how things go.

Im not associated to Bitsquare just a new user. I think this would be a good idea. I would also like to have some kind of "away", "back in 5", "offline" etc. Tonight I did my first sale. I kept watching the app then had a visitor. When I got back to the app I had a sale. Bet the buyer got uneasy as he paid me by Bank Transfer well before I noticed and released the coins.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:43:31
$1000 would be great, especially if it crashes to like $150 first. I've got money waiting and all the exchanges open on my laptop today waiting to bulk buy if this happens.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:26:16
New version downloaded tonight for windows.
Connected first time.
Occasionally have to close app and re-open again.
Ill load some funds in later see how it goes.
Great idea, really like the concept.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:24:51
Try another PC with the chrome bridge, and possibly a cable. Mine did this a while back.
Or just use the recovery seed to pull into a wallet, restore the trezor then stick the funds back in.
You did keep the recovery seed?????
I got the crypto steel and buried it some place safe when I got mine. Love trezor, amazing device!
Any case my friend, hope you get it sorted out good luck.
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:13:03
I dont work for Bitsquare im just a user.
If you were a buyer say and completed a purchase and sent the vendor money to his bank, he went to bed would you want to wait 8 hours for the coins? Guess the point is so you are always there to complete the trade. Thats my view on it.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:27:55
But with transaction fees most blocks will end up 13 point something, unlucky number this folks. Could this be an unlucky 4 next years I ask .......
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:29:06
I'm trying to get Bitsquare to work but the TOR won't connect at all in Windows.
I'll try on a Linux box interested but need help.
@_date: 2016-07-05 19:23:46
Ok, I'll take a look later.
The whole concept is very interesting so would love to get it working. As a small scale miner, the limit is no issue to me I want to sell small volumes to cover the electricity bill. See you on the forum in a while.
Again, thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:43:53
So I sold 0.5 BTC.
Only info I get is senders name, sort code and a/c number in the contract details.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:57:01
Ebang mainly sell high end fibre switch gear.
The E9's have a good reputation so far, there is an in depth thread here
I was looking at the E9, but with the possible release of a 9 th model, I'll wait a while.
So far the few people who have them say they are plug and play and forget. No issues like the S9's.
They are not quite as efficient, but I'm sick of sending hash cards off to be repaired. These just slightly peck Avalon for efficiency so should be considered a viable alternative.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:37:47
Same happened to me 2 weeks ago.
Submitted the proof and heard nothing.
Got an email a few days back all is well and my account is working again.
It's done manually and takes time.
Had no trouble for 12 months then I got the debit card.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:25:45
Nice read Sir, well put.
I'm still hodling my $2 coins back from the day, I mine 24/7 and very occasionally take the wife and kids for a week away when the bubbles hit. In a few years time, IF the price is right I'm out of here and going to enjoy a long easy retirement drinking Sangria on the Costa Blanca, remembering the fun times of mining, the woes of breaking Antminer hash cards and plain shitting it EVERY time I upgraded my hardware the price tanked the day after, over loading circuits, heat, noise, firmware updates you know the score!
