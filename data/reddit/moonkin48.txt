Freakin' Brian, strong arming the markets for pure sport!

Sounds like this is a topic you're not interested in participating in; that's perfectly fine. It's true this will organically sort itself out.
But also realize that public adoption of Bitcoin is affected by this. And before companies like Coinbase decide to make this change, it has to have some degree of community support, which comes from discussions like this one.

Roque– Luke is a Bitcoin Core contributor. This isn't an employee/customer relationship; you and he are peers. The only difference is he donates some of his time to contribute to the open source code that powers Bitcoin. So your reply is empty.
Luke– Of the characteristics that set apart Litecoin from Bitcoin (e.g. Scrypt instead of SHA-256, one-forth the block time), what objectively qualifies it as a scam compared to Bitcoin?

Didn't realize McD handed out free cheeseburgers. 
Back to the real world, and my point -- ideas matter. Example: Bitcoin matters. Who Satoshi is does not matter.
So, I am happy to hear your ideas to keep the Bitcoin community from splitting into two. If you don't care about a split, or welcome a split, I'll gladly hear your thoughts on that too.

You're probably right.

Ideas have value.

*Segwit* is a bundle of fixes and upgrades to the Bitcoin network. In effect, it allows 2x+ transactions per hour, fixes a security vulnerability, and paves the way to cheap, fast micro-transactions.
A *BIP* is a proposed change to Bitcoin. Over the last few years, numerous conservative BIPs have been put forward advocating for release of Segwit. However, all failed to take effect due largely to ideological / political disagreement between 'factions' of the Bitcoin community.
*BIP 148* (aka UASF) is a relatively new proposal that, put simply, makes it against the network rules to not support Segwit. Some will refuse to accept BIP148. If enough refuse, one or more chain splits may occur as a result.
*Segwit2x* (aka Barrycoin, New York Agreement, BTC1) is an agreement or 'treaty' signed by numerous Bitcoin companies (e.g. Coinbase) and miners (~80% hashing power). It calls for the implementation of Segwit and raising block size by 2x. If this pans out fast enough, there will be no risk of BIP 148 leading to a chain split. If it fails, BIP 148 will happen in full force. We'll know in the coming weeks if this effort will succeed or fail.
*UAHF* (aka MAHF, Bitmaincoin) is the publicly announced contingency plan created by mining company Bitmain should Segwit2x fail. It is a counter-measure to BIP 148. This response to BIP 148 is what will cause an actual permanent chain split, via a hard fork. Unlike BIP 148, this action is not 'set in stone' and could be cancelled or changed by Bitmain at any time.
How to prepare: Be sure you have your private keys (for some this means your 12+ word recovery phrase). This means get your coins off Coinbase, exchanges, etc. Ideal options: Hardware Wallet (e.g. Ledger Nano S, Trezor, Keepkey), Paper Wallet.
If a split happens, you will have your coins on both chains as long as you have your private keys (see above paragraph). Unless you know what you're doing, do not transfer or spend your coins after July 29 (for good measure, across all time zones). Wait until you're confident it is safe before transferring or spending from that date onward.
Should you sell, buy, or hold bitcoin? First, never 'invest' more than you can afford to lose. Second, 2017 will be a turbulent time for Bitcoin. No one knows what will happen. I am personally holding with confidence because I believe of all the cryptos Bitcoin has the best prospects of long term value. Make your own assessment and decide accordingly. It never hurts to watch and wait for more stability.

Slow down and actually look at the screenshot. See the other tweets? See the ifttt URLs? These are bots that tweet based on new posts on reddit. I even explained that in my reply tweet.
I'll spell it out for you: I wrote a tweet. I tweeted it. I posted my tweet to Reddit hoping for retweets so they gain traction and have an impact. Those things fired when I created the Reddit post. You can experiment yourself to prove this. Just post on with some title I used. 
Jeff assumed conspiracy too. I don't blame you or him. Human nature. But we gotta strive to dig a bit deeper as we explore.
Edit: Corrected typo.

You cited the origins of litecoin (it copied bitcoin) and its current market dynamics (pump and dump). Respectfully, I don't think that is an objective way to evaluate its merits or viability.
An objective way to evaluate is how its objective characteristics differ from bitcoin. PoW algo, block time, segwit. You are more qualified than most, including myself, to speak to these technical characteristics. But you have to be objective to do so.
Matters such as developer community and current real-world usage are subject to change over time based on objective characteristics.
I'm not arguing litecoin is superior. I'm certainly not arguing it is "worthy" (objectively irrelevant) of ever being functionality superior based on the merit of innovation (or lack thereof). But let's be objective.

People have always thought it was "too late" to buy bitcoin. When it went $0.30 to $3, people felt they missed the boat. When it went from $3 to $30, people thought "if only I had bought some back at $3". Then when it went from $30 to $300, "now it's too expensive".
It's not too late to buy bitcoin. 
But never take out a loan to invest or buy bitcoin. Instead, kick bad habits, save money each week, buy a little bitcoin each week (google "dollar cost averaging"), and save and hold.

Isn't it more accurate to say consensus rules are *defined* by node software developers e.g. Bitcoin Core &amp; *implemented* by economic service providers e.g. Coinbase (rather than everyday Bitcoin users who largely rely on these two parties via SVP wallets)? (I may be wrong; please correct me if so.)
If so though, in theory, a powerful mining cartel could also invest in (1) producing their own node software and (2) lobbying economic service providers, right?

If Vertcoin were to become truly popular, wouldn't ASICs be developed for it?

So let the markets decide. Maybe not the worst worst case scenario. Both could even have their niche. Still hope we can work this out. I expect a lot of chaos and confusion ahead if we split.
