Tether isn't created when someone sells BTC on any USDT exchange, it is created when people buy it from bitfinex for USD.

One channel, unlimited tx.

Leverage, he borrowed other peoples USD to buy bitcoin.

That's incorrect, channels are constructed such that nodes in the network that are acting as hops on your payment route do not have access to the coin. They can only get it by proving they have already sent it.

That's not the point - the point is to never enter your private key into a PC that could have keylogger/trojan. Also Ledger confirms address on the screen so you can see if it has been changed.

Why tax free in the UK?

That's a really unhelpful description, which makes it sound like LN nodes have access to funds. They don't! It is truly a peer-to-peer scheme in that anyone can be a node.

I took it to mean "The remaining amount might grow to be huge again if bitcoin increases in value"

They don't know the destination of money you send - current LN implementations I've looked at use onion routing such as TOR uses.

SegWit was carefully designed to not need a hard fork. In some ways it's analogous to 'backwards compatibility'

I just realised you can send payments in a loop to yourself to rebalance your channels and improve your anonymity - in fact the software could take care of this for you!

What's the problem with routing outgoings back through the channel? If you really didn't want to then it's just one blockchain transaction a month to send your salary to a different channel.

Always use custom fees after checking

I agree you wouldn't want it as your sole channel. I'd keep it, but a every other month take a random amount and put it on another channel. If you're really concerned you could take it all out of it once a month at the cost of one blockchain transaction. 
Just occurred to me that you could send it to yourself via a loop to empty it into a channel with some other party, then no-one would know it went to you!

Do you have a suggestion for how you would secure an distributed consensus system without energy usage?
@_date: 2012-01-09 15:37:24
How do you cope with the need for verification of the validity of the BTC transaction by the network? Or do you just take that risk on?

Can't predict which miner will find the next block, so it's essentially random. (Although weighed by their hashrate)

There will only ever be 21 Mbits.....

How would you check that I sent back the desired calculated results and not just garbage that I created without computing?
