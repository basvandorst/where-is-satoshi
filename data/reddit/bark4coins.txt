changelly is part of one of the biggest scam networks in the cryptoverse. we've been warning about them for years: 
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:35:39
nope, they've changed to using xmr only a while ago.(

never go full ikarus, dude.
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:11:11
 "slightly" :D
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:31:55
not yet, but if only a fraction of the users would participate bisq would be the golden boy :)

bitrefill should be by far the market leader. they also have a partnership with bitwala. dtmf.io is a bit different but a nice and really useful service nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:57:47
not really, services like that for bitcoin have been around for a couple of years now. check out  or

botnets are a possible solution ;-) NK related subjects are already mining monero via botnets for a while now (

 if you start paying little ddos skids, what are you going to do if the three-letter guys are coming, huh?
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:40:05
agreed, also Aaron van Wirdum could be a good addition. don't really know his reddit handle atm.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:18:55
I thought he's Backdoor Judas now.

not surprising, cointelegraph has always been part of a bigger scam network (bytecoin, minergate, coinmarketcap, dash, the list goes on...).
@_date: 2017-04-04 06:37:55
not really true, we fought the whole void at maximum power three times and got almost wiped out twice.

let's hope Exante is one of the maltese governments adivsors on cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:47:44
hm, makes sense :D thx!
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:31:45
I'm happy to see the bus driving away from shapeshift. But why move directly on to the next scam? holy fuck people, don't be surprised if changelly leaves with your money... 
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:01:52
you guys don't have just issues, you are part of one of the biggest scam network in the cryptoverse.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:46:34
moving business away from the vorhees honeypot is smart, but please don't move to changelly. they are shady as fuck too: 
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:12:27
that is not a good/correct tl;dr. I hope people are actually reading the link( in the tweet. 
From IRC:
    fluffypony I spoke to gmaxwell and asked for his advice on how to do the disclosure
    so a lot of it is based on his advice
The bug itself was identified by a member of the MRL a few month ago.
edit: after reading the latest comments it appears that gmax did find this bug too, maybe earlier than the MRL member.

thank you for the clarification! :)
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:13:09
don't forget that charlie was also super stoked to do a buy a waste company ICO on eth together with granger danger...

time to eat some cat food and sniff some glue.

wiwo had the first german article on bitcoin in 2011 which got me into it. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:27:57
maybe it's the chinese way of agreeing to uasf without losing face.
