How so?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:39:47
Fair, positive analysis. Real news.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:03:21
John Podesta is a serial child murderer. Anyone that hears someone say this, fails to do due diligence in the subsequent research, and STILL is an anti-Trumpet is not only supremely ignorant, but pure evil.
I’ll say it again. John Podesta murders children for fun. Crooked Hillary was going to make him Secretary of State. You probably voted to put that man in the WH, and you will definitely be judged for it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:47:33
They are under a spell. Time to WAKE UP! Being anti-Trump is about as uncool and cringe as it possibly gets.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:09:35
You realize anyone who knowingly mocks the worldwide citizen investigation into Pedogate will be automatically flagged as a member of a pedophile organization and eventually arrested as an accomplice to mass murder of children. Department of Homeland Security is actively monitoring your situation now. I would advise you do some basic research, read Wikileaks, and publicly admit you don’t know what you’re taking about and you are sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:06:16
They’re such haters. Jealous of Trump. Can’t admit they were not on the winning team. They’re just bad people honestly,
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:32:11
John Podesta murders children. Anyone anti-Trump supports this and should be ashamed of themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:35:45
She’s not that smart. She’s more “let them eat cake”

Do you realize EVERY. SINGLE. MEMBER. of President Trump's cabinet, as well as ALL his most recognizable supporters are EARLY Bitcoiners ? Welcome to your new reality, where Trump and his people run the world. And this is good thing, so be grateful. Crooked Hillary would have made Bitcoin felony possession, this is what the election and subsequent year was entirely about, the complete destruction and replacement of the previous corrupt power structure.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:11:27
Sandy Hook was literally fake. How are you going to look yourself in the mirror when this is common knowledge? You’ll face an existential crisis because you’ll be forced to admit you are simply not as bright as you think you are, a crushing blow to your personal self-esteem.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:38:16
If you decide not to do any research and blindly deny the fact that John Podesta is a serial murderer of children, which he in fact is, your conscience will have to live with the guilt as what I’m telling you continues to be proven.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:15:51
Don't let these poor idiots influence you. They're triggered trolls who are going to fuck up their BTC investments because they are stupid. 
Any fucking loser that hates Trump should sell their Bitcoin, because Donald Trump is the Bitcoin President.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:12:38
You guys are so ungrateful! Donald Trump is the Bitcoin President. If Crooked Hillary was elected, she would have immediately made it felony possession! Deal with it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:39:53
90% of Bitcoiners are Pro-Trump and get it. Anyone who thinks otherwise is in a delusional bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:20:53
Maybe that’s because you’re simply not cool enough to understand. Btw, you will never get the girl.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:28:01
Then sue me. Maybe John Podesta should sue me, but he can’t. You know why? Because he’s a fucking child molester and serial murderer of children. And he can not litigate in court. You voted for this sick fuck to run this country. Again. Shame on you. Fucking judgement!

Enron was trading "the weather." Bitcoin is backed by time itself. No comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:36:13
It will always be the oldest. That will also never change.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:41:29
Yes it is.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:37:21
Oh yeah totally.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:29:10
Exactly like Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:30:42
Alright so there’s 42M between both. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:41
Counterfeit Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:51:35
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:05:22
I agree. This is a coup. Get with it Bitcoin people. Play some hardball. Bitcoin Cash aims to form a counterfeit enterprise.

Ok so high profile US politicians go down for elite sex crimes. US govt says dark web is banned, bitcoin usage is banned so this can never happen again. Enact laws. Enforce laws. 
What happens to Bitcoin if that happens?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:57:51
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:39:02
I agree, but let's say some high profile elites are involved, and the dark web and by extension bitcoin face major public backlash and outrage. If the media directs the public outrage towards cryptocurrency, "secret money", it could create a stigma, and what if the USA were to ban its use as a result?

Ray Dalio is James Comeys mentor. Both psychopaths. His hedge fund is secret psychopath school.

Billionaire mindset. You're gonna make a billion dollars too.

What happens if you have coins being HODL in Coinbase, do nothing at all, and there is no split? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:00:08
What makes you think that? I see no evidence of lunacy. I see a competent, sane critical thinker who happened to read the contents of leaked emails published by Wikileaks.

Been following David Seaman for awhile, I can see why people are skeptical of him but he's the real deal.
