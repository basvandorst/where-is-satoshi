You known you sound like a conspiracy theorist?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:10:01
If you say so 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:12:24
I'm not sure what you mean.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:36:00
I'm looking for a dialogue not an 'answer'. Bitcoin is nothing like Amazon or Apple, both of those actauklyndevelop and sell products. Nothing has happened to justify bitcoins value, it's pure madness.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:46:16
Exceot in most cases, both parties get something out of the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:10:14
No doubt there's a bubble there too, this isn't an us vs them thing though.  I amnt on the fiat tean or whatver.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:50:30
I ain't worrying! And why do people keep mentioning Amazon?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:44:39
"Ok cool", "cya", "bud" hmmmm
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:25:07
It's so simple and obvious. People buy in, the price increases as more and more people join. This in turn gets more people interested. Then as people start joining in at a faster rate, the price jumps more quickly. Before you know it the market is crazy which only exacerbates exposure. It's a massive massive bubble, and at some point people are going to realise everyone else is doing exactly the same as themselves -hoping to make free money off the backs of everyone else who's bought into this get rich quick scheme. The smart people cashed out as it was approaching 20k. It won't get back to that level for probably a few years now. Lots of people are going to get burnt when it next dives and stays low. Lots will probably stay as they are too invested to escape with a loss, however, after a year or so I see others getting fed up of waiting. The market will slowly decrease as more and more people look at the slow downward trend. Then, in years ahead, it will pick up again and we'll go through the same cycle again.

Of course there are others. I would strongly disagree with the idea that there's a substantial enough turnover rate of people like yourself to have a meaningful impact. At the end of the day, people care more about the money they have tomorow than an idea that may never come to.fruition.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:15:58
I probably will if you can tell me a way to short bitcoin. And don't say with another crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:16:21
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:13:33
Thanks I'll have a look into some of those. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:51:05
Why are you so personally insulted by this that you find the need to mock me? Seriously, all I want is to discuss it but most replies so far have been insults with little substance

Real world investment: positive sum game
Bitcoin: Zero sum game 
I can't put it any simpler to you 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:36:16
I'm not worried because I have zero investment in bitcoin or any other crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:44
Yes stable. You've described devaluation, not instability. Investors much prefer stability and slow devaluation to massive devaluation over night and constant uncertainty. Until crypto solves that problem, both individuals and institutions will stick to banks.
It's absolute fantasy to think that bitcoin is anywhere near securing sustained serious allocation of money from the institutions that matter.
Keep telling yourself that I'm just uneducated and haven't opened my mind, but bitcoin will never be the default.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:34:56
This comment really highlights the immaturity of this sub. A single reddit post isn't going to crash the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:11:25
don't be mad cause bitcoin is in decline
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:48:40
No worries. I can see how what I've wrote might seem obvious (which is actually why I wrote it) however the quality of comment I have received in return has been quite poor in some cases. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:07:57
Because that's the important part of my comment.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:03:54
not much of an argument lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:55:07
Google trends has shown a dip in exposure after a massive peak. Yes there are millions whondont know about bitcoin but those people are probably too distanced from the technology world to ever contemplate investing -never mind researching bitcoin or crypto
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:00:32


it is if it wants to grow
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:41:35
Honestly i think It will happen again, it'll.justnbe smaller. Another sucker is born every day.

Only a shit post cause you joined In (only kidding)
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:11:51
Thank you! I felt like I was going crazy watching this place. It really is quite fascinating but also worrying how cultish this place feels most of the time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:03:35
They are more trustworthy in that the value of the currency is much more stable and is insured. Youndont have to worry about someone hacking your account with a bank. Youre covered. You do with crypto. That Is what I meant by that comment. 
As for your point on opposition to bitcoin. I think you massively underestimate the power that governments have. If they want to, they will destroy It. If all they do Is mention regulations, you're going to see a market collapse. I really am struggling to see how bitcoin or crypto becomes a stable currency that people can rely on. The hurdles are massive and vast in number. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:32:20
Don't you think that the opposition to this is too massive to overcome. Banks are in bed with governments, that's just a fact. People's lives are too intertwined with banks to switch to crypto and crypto deosnt have anywhere near the trustworthiness that banks do. Crypto is historically unstable and you wont find people trusting that. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:08:36


you have a victim complex.


because it is.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:49:31
I'd prefer to have a discussion where you critique my post
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:12:53
I wouldn't even know how 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:43:21
If the guy genuinely doesn't care for my post then why even make a comment lol? Be honest, it's clear the idea that I'm right is something that op felt the need to reject in their own mind. Otherwise what's the point of making the comment? And you're mistaken about me, I am Interested in following the story, I just have no intention of investing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:38:20
I haven't out a pennyninto bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:06:43
feel free to disagree, but you look foolish suggesting I haven't provided reasoning when I demonstratably have and you yourself haven't. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:08:58
The severe lack.of criticism inspired me to wrote that. It's quite suspect
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:16:48
Claim: yes   
Evidence/ reasoning: no
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:02:38
I've explained what I think has given it's supoosed value and you haven't said anything to dispute my reasoning, nor have you given an explanation as to the 'real' reason for it's value 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:15:09
Fascinating 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:14:37
And my point it isn't an investment if all that ends up happening is money is redistributed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:08:22
makes sense i guess
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:48:20
You haven't explained how people are going to be able to withdraw that money whilst not being at the expense of some other people losing money 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:23:47
Don't think.of.it as an investment. It's a gamble, pure and simple. There's nothing to say bitcoin isn't just going.to.fall for the next few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:44:22
There's a crash coming, it might go over 20k in the very short term, but there is definitely a major crash coming which will take a long time to recover from

Why are you so offended by my post, like Seriously!? I just hope the reason isn't that you're so invested it would devastate you if I were to be right.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:15:38
Thanks for restoring my sanity 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:16:55
My reason is that I think we've hit peak exposure 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:14:38
I hadn't thought too much though that. Even the slightestbhint of regulations would crash the market.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:38:47
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:08:29
Well I haven't seen even the slightest discussion on here about the notion that that bitcoin is mostly just other people hoping to make money off other People. Sorry for trying to have a real discussion where none existed before. I wonder if you're so critical towards those spamming HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:28:18
I think most people are looking at it as an investment. I find it hard to believe that that massive spike in new users was anything but hoards of people who aren't really interested in the technology, only the chance of making some easy money for little effort. Those people will want to withdraw at some point, who wouldn't? Comparing bitcoin to a fiat currency isn't logical. Fiat has a substantially higher percentage of currency in circulation for the buying and selling of goods and services. Bitcoin does this too but the majority of it is just sitting in people's wallets with no intention other than to trade it. People can expect the value of Apple stock to increase based on real value of a companies assets. There's no massive increase in sales using bitcoin. The growth is purely derived from new users.

How does your algorithm recognise what is essentially human hivemind thinking? Numbers can be put into a formula but how can a formula make navigate and recognise human thought process? Genuinely interested if you have been able to address this obvious challenge ?
