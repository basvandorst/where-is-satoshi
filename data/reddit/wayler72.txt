Hell yeah - i don't want to spew too much advice because i'm barely much more than a noob but i can say with 99.9% certainty that trying to micromanage different aspects of timing the market doesn't work for your average dude, at least long term. You can get lucky once in a while but more times than not you'll lose. The unfortunate thing is I still have to relearn that more often than I'd like, including today.
My uneducated thought is right now we are not hitting a serious 20k BTC type bull run, so I've been expecting some gains but then expecting to see things fall back a little. I got it in my dumb-ass head that if I saw things falling off X percent that I could pull about half my holdings and put them into a USD coin until things bottomed back out a little and then buy back in at lower prices. I saw a point where that seemed to be happening, so I did as I described above but about 20 minutes later prices started going back up higher than what I was expecting so I panicked and bought (almost) everything back. In that 20 minutes I lost about $300.
I KNOW what is right for me is to just keep consistently buying when I have the money to do so and then wait a few years until the big, well founded gains come, but sometimes I'm stupid and have to relearn again. Good luck!

I agree, and of course want to get it as cheap as possible but when it hits 20k again it won't matter much if you got it at $4300 or $4900. Just keep buying little bits along the way when you can, trying to time the market just doesn't work long term unless you're a bot.
