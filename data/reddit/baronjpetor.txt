Don't know much about bitcoin but I know enough to consider that hodling a *small* part of my capital in bitcoin is a strategy with a good upside (moon) and a negligible downside (losing this small part of my capital). 
Good enough for me.

This is the sad truth in life: give someone a good financial tip and the person will completely "forget" about thanking you. 
On the opposite, if your recommendation happens not to be that good then you'll hear the other guy rant about your crappy tip forever. You may even lose a friend.
That's why I never give financial advice to anyone. Not worth it.

This times 1000. The whole government of Venezuela should be given the Nuremberg treatment, plain and simple. 
The humanitarian crisis there is absolutely out of control. I spend a good amount of my time in Colombia and the Venezuelan refugees are arriving here by the 100000. 
Venezuela used to be the richest country of Latin America by far and now it's a complete shit hole. It infuriates me that there are still a lot of armchair leftists in Europe who never went to Latin America and still support the butchers of this government.
Make no mistake: the cryptocurrency community can't afford to support Venezuelan government's murdercoin. That would not only be ethically wrong: it would also be totally counterproductive and would give arguments to people who are against cryptocurrencies in general.

Another French here. I really love bitcoin and all it represents, but please, PLEASE, if something has to push bitcoin price to new highs, let it NOT be Le Pen's election or Frexit. This would be a nightmare for the country.
Macron won anyway :)

Ok so in practical terms for the average BTC user who doesn't understand a thing about what's happening, does it mean we have to include a higher fee if we want the transaction to be processed fast?
