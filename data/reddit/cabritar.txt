Trying to figure out what happening here.
This guys lost his bit coins? Some one stole it or was it misplaced. 
Also did btcrobinhood give OP 35 of his own bit coins, or did he return the ones that were lost/stolen?

Why are you so confident that the dollar is doomed?
And why haven't the majority of investors made the move to bitcoin?

Bitcoin can be the best thing ever but if I can't use it at my local Walmart or to buy stuff on Amazon, it won't be much.
I'm excited about bitcoin but it isn't "happening" unless your average person can use it to buy stuff.
I think cryptocurrency is going to be a big issue with in the next 10 or so years. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens.

Elaborate.

Basically you run a piece of software on your computer that makes your graphics card break math problems.
If your graphics card solves a math problem then you have "mined" a bitcoin.
Just remember that every one else who is mining is trying to break the same math problem you are, so the more graphics cards you have working on these math problems the more likely you will be the one who mines it.

I sometimes mention to process to those who ask about it and I use passwords for simplicity sake but I would like to be a better ambassador.
So how does one ELI5 with out using complicated language or too many terms?
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:49:06


Exactly. I didn't realize it until I got responses to my comment. When things are trying to get off the ground the PR is important and telling people who don't know what BC mining is that it cracks passwords could lead to problems.
Thanks for the feed back. Math problems it is.

Exactly. This is what excites me about bitcoin. I can't wait to wake up one day and have Walmart now accepts bitcon at the top my front page.
Until then however, I don't think bitcoiners(?) should be saying that "it's happening". It might, it could, but until then it's super useful for non-developed countries and those who really don't want a paper trail.

ELI5 is the direction I was going for.
Who needs to know that level of detail? If it sounds interesting, look up more info on it and eventually you'll fall down the rabbit whole like everyone else and learn all the minute details.
With out using the world hash or password what is the next best ELI5 alternative?
EDIT: Maybe math problem instead of password?
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:58:13
It does. Look at anything complicated on ELI5.
If it's under 100 words it usually is. Then of course someone posts the much more complicated version that is either very difficult to follow and short, easy to follow by 10x longer, or both more complicated and very long.

I can't say that's all true. I doubt many are using bitcoin or energy to hedge the dollar, although precious metals are used to hedge. Even then, if you look at the price of gold, it's been dropping since late 2008. Investors aren't reading that the dollar is doomed, if the dollar were "doomed" then they would have moved on, no?


Well that's true of bitcoin as well. Eventually things will stop. Regimes fall, empires fall, heat death of the universe etc. But does that mean we should abandon the dollar because eventually it will fail? When listening to Andreas and Stefan they have a sense of urgency the drop the dollar asap when that isn't a good strategy because the dollar still has utility. That's my problem with *some bitcoin evangelists*. Even in the long term they are right, doesn't mean some people should switch. Imagine guys like Andreas and Stefan were in power and the official currency became bitcoin; do you think it would benefit everyone? Imagine the elderly people in your life trying manage their bitcoin wallet. The dollar is not perfect, neither is bitcoin, bitcoin is working on becoming better but the dollar is status quo. For developing countries I'm sure crypocurrency is a god send but for people in developed nations it's not worth making that move yet. Maybe in 20 or more years away from necessary adoption if ever.


Ok well here's my issue, in 1769 the car was invented. It was unreliable, volatile, super expensive and didn't have many uses. In 1908 Ford's model T arrived and was one of the most relyable cars, cheap, and easily maintained cars. That's a difference of nearly 140 years from creation to ready for mainstream use.
Bitcoin came out in 2008, and you, Andreas, and Stefan thinks it's ready for the prime time in 2014? Right now, in the US, the dollar (horse) is still the better choice than the unpolished bitcoin (car). Things will change, but it will be later than sooner and I think giving financial advice to join bitcoin for all is a bad idea.
Another question about BC...
Does it become exponentially more difficult to mine each coin?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:15:53
Hard fork?
Is this a community issue being resolved or is it occurring because of the protocol?
