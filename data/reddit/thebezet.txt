@_date: 2018-01-10 18:41:52
But credit cards are used to spend money you don't have, while with Bitcoin you can never spend money you don't have. My point is, you can't really compare a credit card to a Bitcoin Wallet. A debit card is more like it.

lol. Did any of the books you read explained to you that 95% of money, according to the Bank of England, is created by issuing private loans? Did you read anything by any of the economists who predicted the 2008 crash? Steve Keen, Richard Murphy, Raghuram Rajan, the aforementioned Ann Pettifor, Wynne Godley? And that according to these economists the crash happened because of the deregulated banking market that saw loans being created for high risk investments, unpayable subprime mortgages given for quick gains? The next crash is inevitable, because the people in power didn't learn anything - and you're an example, mumbling about the government creating money out of thin air. Well, like I've mentioned earlier, it's not the government and central banks that practically control the creation of money, it's the private banks, and we have stats to prove it. The government has little influence nowadays because of deregulation. It's the post-Keynesian and Minsky models that predicted the crash, and it's from those school of thoughts we need to learn to avoid yet another one. And guess what, Bitcoin can't solve any problems to prevent another financial crisis, it has a contractionary nature and, while many bitcoin fans pretend it's not a problem, it can easily lead to a deflationary spiral.
We need to break the power of bankers. But Bitcoin is not the way to do it. It's a rather naive solution that thinks we need even more deregulation and a solution that would be eerily similar to the gold standard and take us back to the 18th century. What we need is more democratic control over bankers. Financial deregulation has facilitated the creation of almost limitless credit. With this credit boom have come irresponsible and often fraudulent patterns of lending, and creating inflated bubbles in assets such as real estate property. This is because there isn't enough government control, not too much of it.
Read more about it. Look at the people who correctly and accurately predicted the crash, and are predicting another one.

Palestinians are not Israelis you ignorant clown. If they were, they would have Israeli citizenship. You're thinking of Palestinians living in Israel.
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:30:21
Crypto doesn't solve much. I know that Bitcoin fans like to think so, but it really doesn't. There are of course regions in Africa where people trade mobile minutes. There are examples of people using bitcoin (btw this headline is very exaggerated, there are *some* Palestinians who use bitcoin.
In these countries, cash is still the best medium. Most people don't have enough savings to need to store them somewhere, this is only a problem of the richer minority. And you can come and shout "Venezuela", but the truth is, if Venezuelans bought bitcoin at the beginning of the year, they would have lost more money. Bitcoin does not solve any problems for them.

Well yes, precisely, I am not sure why you brought up Wells Fargo then if they have been fraudulently creating accounts for their customers and issuing charges. Bitcoin does not address that. Sure, you can't take "someone else's BTC without \[their\] permission", but entities can still issue charged that you would be contractually obliged to pay. I am not sure if you own a credit card, but you are required to pay it off, usually on a monthly basis. You can do this manually, or setup a direct debit. Regardless, bitcoin won't save you from fraudulent deals. Sure, you can refuse to pay, but you can already do that. And that doesn't save you from financial responsibility.  
"You either own it or you do not. there are no in-between."  
This is the main problem with bitcoin fans. They don't understand that the invention of credit has moved us from medieval times to a modern economy. The ability to increase the amount of broad money in an economy is beneficial, if, of course, done reasonably. No longer we have to ask rich lords who hoard money and make thousands through usury, a central bank can allow entities to issue money and create credit that can be used to create more value. Bitcoin does not address that at all. Literally every modern economy relies on a healthy credit system. If you want to get rid of the so-called credit system, and only allow borrowing from people who own money, you will be moving back to the dark ages and ending up with hyperdeflation. I recommend you read about how money is created, like 'The Production of Money', by Ann Pettifor which gives a decent explanation (nota bene she predicted the financial crash in 2007/08).
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:21:55
Sorry to burst your bubble, but using bitcoin does not protect you from liability. Even if you suffer from a ridiculous lawsuit, which I assume happens very often in USA, you still are required to pay. You can of course go rogue, live in the woods and pay for your supplies with bitcoin, but that doesn't seem like a reasonable solution. You can also theoretically declare bankruptcy while owning bitcoin, but not only that has long-lasting ramifications, you are still limited in terms of what you can pay for with bitcoin – I don't mean that not many people accept bitcoin, but that any larger purchase can be tracked back to you, unless you lie about your billing address and your postal address.
Crippling medical bills is a quite unique American experience, and I'm sorry you and your fellow citizens need to deal with this, but once again, if you are unable to pay the creditor you still have to declare bankruptcy and suffer the consequences of that situation.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:33:00
Haha, how ironic.
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:57:31
I guess what I'm trying to say is that people tend to treat Bitcoin as some miracle cure, something that will save every economy in every country. Which is far from the truth. Likewise with Turkey, well, maybe some people will "win" by investing in bitcoin, maybe other people will "win" by investing in something completely different. But the potential of bitcoin to have a groundbreaking impact on economies has always been exaggerated. It doesn't address any of the problems that countries are facing, it does not address any of the problems that caused the recent 2007-2008 crash.
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:35:27
From the article:
* According to CoinDesk, there is a **handful** of Palestinians utilizing Bitcoin to transact outside of the country's borders amid conflict
* Ahmed Ismail, a financial analyst in Gaza, estimated **20** unofficial Bitcoin **dealers**, including himself, who help clients purchase Bitcoin to send money abroad, purchase investments abroad, or shop abroad
* One of the Bitcoin dealers has helped up to **50** different **families** over the last four years to purchase an average of $500 worth of Bitcoin each month so they can transact freely
This really is a headline about nothing. There's a handful dealers who sell to perhaps a few hundred people who use bitcoin. The only advantage of bitcoin for Palestinians is that they can do international transfers that could potentially be otherwise blocked by the Israeli government.

Right, tell me then smarty pants, since you brought up Wells Fargo, how can Bitcoin prevent fraud in terms of creating credit lines, saving accounts, mortgages and similar financial products? Don't try to avoid answering.

Listen mate, I owned bitcoin for around 7-8 years now, and I had enough time to learn and discuss it's pros and cons. You haven't addressed any of my concerns, you just gave me a very weak sales pitch. Let me try again:
If we end up with a bitcoin standard akin to the gold standard, how can we avoid a deflationary spiral? How do we avoid capitalism on steroids where only money owned can be lent, encouraging usury with extreme interest fees creating unpayable loans for the less wealthy? How do we address the fact that since power relations in this situation favour entities with more capital, and thus gives even more power to private bankers? How will we avoid the creation of even more extreme wealth inequality? And, considering all this, how does bitcoin address any major economical issues we are facing today, other than being able to buy weed on darkweb and sending relatively cheap international transfers?
You avoiding answers to these questions suggests to me that you've never considered any of the above.
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:47:49
Can you please point out to me where you are trying to convince me otherwise? All you've been saying is "BTC is great", "you don't understand BTC". You haven't addressed a single issue I've raised. That seems like a bad use of my time.

Seriously, how many times in recent years did an investor lose their assets because they were seized by the government? If that guy had a $10bn portfolio, I'm sure he is smart enough to be aware that things are a lot more complicated than "hurr durr guberment cant touch my coins". But of course this story never happened anyway.

@_date: 2018-09-05 10:01:30
This video is, alas, pretty inaccurate, at least the first half. I recommend you read Ann Pettifor's *"The Production of Money"* to learn more about how money is "made". The government does not really "control the money supply", this power is more in the hands of commercial banks that issue credit, which expands the total supply of broad money, and who, due to deregulation, have an incredibly large influence over world economies. The video also completely ignores, or at least oversimplifies, why fiat money was introduced, why variations in the supply of money can be beneficial, makes an incorrect logical leap from rulers/lords accumulating gold and people holding "paper money" to the modern form of "money", doesn't explain why modern economies have departed from tying wealth/money entirely to the amount of gold owned, doesn't explain inflation and deflation etc. etc.  
It's nicely produced though, I like the video clips and the soundtrack.
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:46:40
This is completely irrelevant to the topic. These aren't assets that a big investor has invested in, plus bitcoin does not protect you from lawsuits and foreclosures. If you have a mortgage, you have to make monthly payments. If you are fined for whatever reason, you pay the fine. How is this relevant?
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:29:08
Also, the widely accepted Keynesian theory regarding the cause of the Great Depression suggests that the government should have \_spent more\_. Even the less widely accepted monetarist theory does not point at debt accrual as the cause of the depression. Federal spending was quite low when the depression started.
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:16:17
One cannot simplify the causes of the mortgage crisis to just one factor like this. There were many factors, including bad government regulation (that allowed predatory lending and encouraged risk taking), overbuilding of private companies during the boom period, high corporate debt levels, increase of property prices while salaries have been stagnating since the 70s etc..
Still, this had nothing to do with *unconstrained government spending*.

@_date: 2018-08-08 10:23:39
Bitcoin will not solve anything. Just like said, we "can't stop anyone from (...) doing whatever the fuck they want to do with bitcoin". Obviously a lot of libertarians, the bulk of Bitcoin supporters, don't see that the problem is systematic - it's capitalism, and it's not just "banks owning your money". Bitcoin has already been manipulated multiple times by pump and dump techniques, because it is unregulated. In fact, bitcoin has a lot more potential to be exploited by big financial institutions that have more capital, than regular currencies.
Bitcoin is not a silver bullet. It's not even a bullet. Corrupt and greedy people from financial institutions will and already have adapted, and will continue fucking with the economy.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:54:19

But right now bitcoin is pretty useless, it is expensive and slow to use, definitely completely unusable right now for micropayments; it is hardly used anymore by retailers, the number of the top 500 internet retailers accepting Bitcoin had fallen to just three.
That's why a lot of bitcoin apologists have started describing the currency as a "store of value" rather than a form of payment, because frankly, there is absolutely no reason to pay with bitcoin unless you're buying something illegal like weed on darkweb. Its only hope is in the lightning network that will make it somewhat usable, but that comes with slight centralisation, something that breaks the original "Bitcoin promise", and until bitcoin becomes widely used, which right now looks unlikely, it will not be preferred by retailers since they will always have to convert it back to "real currency". 
An average person is more concerned with credit card fraud than with their transactions being "censored", and bitcoin offers no protection in that regard because of the irreversible nature of transactions. So bitcoin, in my humble opinion, is not both, it's hardly one, and until the transactions fees are reduced, the speed increased, and some form of consumer protection is guaranteed, there is absolutely no reason for "regular people" to start using it on a larger scale.
Remember, this is just my opinion though.

First of all, Smoot-Hawley couldn't have triggered the Great Depression since it was introduced in 1930, while the Depression started a year earlier. It merely made it worse. Moreover it is only mentioned in passing in main-stream explanations of the Depression.
I gave you the example of the Great Depression as an economic crisis that wasn't caused by government overspending. Likewise the 2008 crisis had nothing to do with overspending.

@_date: 2014-07-04 16:48:25
20GB is not a lot. Storage is cheap, and is getting cheaper, overall bandwidth is improving. If we want increased bitcoin adoption, we can't rely on the idea that everyone needs to download the whole blockchain in order to use bitcoin. If you want to contribute to the network, downloading 20GB+ shouldn't be a problem, and will be even less of a problem in the future – the speed at which technology will improve and become accessible will definitely surpass the speed at which the blockchain is increasing in size.
TL;DR - we don't need pruning.

It's funny. I've randomly checked the price of Bitcoin today, and was pleasantly surprised, as it's higher than when I bought ~1.5 years ago. But now I'm reading there's a crash happening?

If you're comparing a wallet app to a central bank, you don't seem to know much about how the banking system, or money for that matter, works.
@_date: 2018-10-10 09:36:42
Trust whom?
Creditors? Private banks? People managing the central bank? The government's fiscal policy? The government's monetary policy? Lobbyist influencing these policies?  
Bitcoin miners? People managing mining groups and mining pools? Private companies managing wallets? Private companies issuing credit in bitcoin? Developers maintaining your wallet apps, trading, mining software? Internet providers?

It's literally impossible to "do everything yourself", in order to survive you need at least minimal cooperation and in consequence, trust.

But one can pay, withdraw money and transfer funds to other accounts at most banks 24/7. International transfers would be an exception here, but that's a specific case.

Old meme that still makes little sense.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:50:17
I don't think there are many parallels between the two.
Adoption rose drastically for the Internet, from 11% in 1995 to 54% in 2005 (for developed countries). Bitcoin hasn't even got a fraction of that, and I don't expect it to be used as a main currency anywhere, because no sane country would like to go back to the gold standard. Moreover bitcoin only provides a solution to some people's needs, not all of them. I don't really understand why you're saying that people thought the "internet was evil" in the past. I can't think of any major examples of this. Blockchain technology has a very limited scope when compared with the internet. It solves some problems, it's useful for some use-cases, but that's about it.
People like to compare Bitcoin to the Internet, but given what's happening we don't see a massive jump in adoption despite living in a hyper-accelerated society. In fact a lot of people say that "the fad is over", and they might be right, looking at the trading volumes.

I guess everything is relative - we had an 8% drop in September that occurred over the course of a couple days. Compared to major fiat currencies, even the ones that aren't doing that well (e.g. GBP) that's massive. Maybe compared to other cryptocurrencies that's okay.
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:07:21
Rant? I was just asking for you to clarify, as implying "I don't trust the banking system" is quite a strange thing to do, it's a multilayered system that has both fiscal and monetary elements to it, and bitcoin only addresses a tiny part of it. It's like saying "I wonder who will have a better reputation, the food industry or a strict vegetarian diet".
EDIT: Also, saying that the central bank can ruin your money is the bit that implies you knowledge is quite minimal, as a central bank has little power over "your money", you should be more concerned with private bankers.

"But securing your life savings for $5 is a steal."
Only if you make one transaction ever. So your life savings are secure because you're not allowed to used them at all if you don't want to pay $10+ every time you want to use your funds.
High fees are a massive, massive problem and we shouldn't downplay it with such vapid statements.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:50:11
I just wanted to spend my bitcoin, but I've realised I would have to pay **£10** in fees (!!!) if I wanted to get the transaction confirmed within an hour or so.
So, if I wanted to transfer money to someone in Turkey, I would have to first pay ten quid, then that person would have to pay equally high transaction fees in order to use that money.
How is Bitcoin a winner if I have absolutely no reason to use it anymore - slow payments, very high fees?

"Without the help of banks"
You seem super confused. The Reichsbank existed when Hitler was in power. It printed more money when needed, especially when Mefo bills were presented for payment. The enormous military buildup that Germany was creating was financed to a large extent through deficit spending. DEFICIT SPENDING.
You seem to have read one article on some blog and now you think you know everything.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:42:30
lol, I oppose private banks and how they are run nowadays, how they are unregulated and I fully blame them for the 2008 crash. You just seem to be so narrow-minded and ignorant on the subject, you don't understand what people are telling you, - and you only see two boxes: pro-bitcoin and pro-bank. Honestly, read up on the subject as this is embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:49:28
This only applies to a fraction of people. "Regular" people rarely need to make transfers this large.
@_date: 2018-11-06 11:32:25
But what has this got to do with anything? What's the pathetic situation you are talking about?
@_date: 2018-11-06 12:26:34
I'm sorry but... how old are you? You don't seem to understand... much.
The Reichsmark was introduced because of the 20s hyperinflation caused by the 1st World War. Thanks to MEFO, Germans pretended the Hitlerian economics were a success, but in reality MEFO was secretly printing money.
Do you understand what public dept is, and how it is created? You understand that it is not similar to private debts? Problems only arise when there are signs a government may fail to pay back its debt at all, that can cause a sovereign debt crisis.
Bitcoin... doesn't address this at all.
How about you lay off YouTube videos and read an actual book?
EDIT: Also, the quote you mentioned is actually... anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:54:39
Previously, all the power was in the hands of rich lords who hoarded money and increased their wealth exponentially through usury. If you ever needed money, you would have to go through such lord who would dictate his rules, giving loans with excruciatingly high interest rates. After we developed our modern monetary system, credit became a lot more accessible, giving regular people the ability to start new initiatives and stimulate economic growth.
No serious economist supports the return of the gold standard. It's preposterous. However a lot of people support monetary reforms that take the power from private banks who are trashing the economy through high-risk lending. They caused the 2008 crisis, which was predicted by economists such as Ann Pettifor. Bitcoin is not the answer here, but rather improved and sensible regulation that puts a leash on private banks.
@_date: 2018-11-06 11:31:02
lol... Market share of what? The main source of income of private banks is from loans.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:32:46
I don't support the current "system" where highly unregulated private banks do high-risk lending you donut. You just seem utterly confused as to how things work, since you're supporting both bitcoin, and economies based on heavy deficit spending.

This is wildly incorrect. Most people rely on the creation of credit in one way or the other. According to the Bank of England, 90% of money in circulation has been initially created as credit.

Control. Yes, exactly. And in a completely unregulated free market, who has most control? [The big players with the most capital.]( Financial institutions have the power and resources to influence cryptocurrencies, it's naive to think otherwise.

When we all moved from the gold standard to our modern monetary system, that was progress. We ditched medieval hierarchies and power structures related to ownership of money. You make it sound like going back to a glorified gold standard is somewhat progress.

Of course. That's the only reason most people use bitcoin. To an average person bitcoin doesn't provide any advantages over regular currency. So bitcoin is mostly used for things that are illegal in certain places, like weed.
