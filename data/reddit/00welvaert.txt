I've started using crypto twitter a lot more than crypto reddit for this reason. give it a try.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:57:22
whatsup with lightening network? how does it work? is it like a hard fork? who is implementing it? and does that make it centralized? if anyone could point me in the right direction that would be appreciated, thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:24:13
gotcha. fuck me im 17 nearly 18. i guess ill just trade for a guardian with my card...
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:58:37
hey rosie thanks for responding. I made the second account because I've been waiting around 10 days for support to email me. It has the identity of a legal guardian, signed consent, my identity, and my payment method. I am 17. could you please tell me why my account was restricted prior to the creation of the other one? Does coinbase not allow minors to trade? I only made my other account because I was worried that I wouldn't receive support for my first account
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:31:48
yeah theyre customer support is ass. do you have another service that youd reccomed?
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:02:31

@_date: 2017-08-03 17:29:19

@_date: 2017-08-31 14:35:54
im 17. good on you for joining the fun man.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:30:08
not your keys, not your coins. if coinbase goes down, you cant do anything with "your" coins. Yes, they you purchased them and they belong to you, but while theyre on the exchange theyre in your superficial control. 
i recommend a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger nano s, but electrum is a good alternative software wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:25:57
redditor for two days. fuck out of here with your anti-bitcoin bullshit. we're thriving, if you think any of this hardfork FUD can stop us youre wrong. BTC is going up from here and nothing can stop it. this attack will prove the strength of our real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:31:49
fixed it thanks
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:23:14
i cant imagine how many bitcoin noobs have gone there just to get completely fucked over
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:37:27
I dont give a shit
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:46:29
i have been!!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:46:33
same! i wish i went all in when i first started studying/observing (700/BTC). But who knew that the price would go up 7,000USD this year? nobody.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:58:30
I didnt do it I just posted a picture /s
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:52:06
Who gives a fuck what he thinks? He clearly doesn't know anything about cryptocurrencies. He's just a hedge fund old school man.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:02:31

oh shit they have seeds??? THATS LIVE
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:51:42
i always thought that satoshi was a time traveling alien who gifted humanity with blockchain technology in 08'
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:45:25
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:19:05
no man keep it. It's funny.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:21:12
It gives us ample time to develop an understand of the technology and allows us to appreciate its growth through the years.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:45:49
He's talking about a failure of fiat. Its not necessarily credibility but Im not going to correct him. his reason to appreciate BTC is good for me.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:41:20
boy what? did you say sell? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:53:46
i like this. it has a cocky vibe. This could be us if we adopted in 2010. oh well.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:32:43

@_date: 2017-10-24 12:32:05
what a stupid cunt
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:45:06
CNBC? honestly the viewers of this pathetic american news outlet and far too unintelligent to make an educated fucking vote on this topic. "ooooh jamie said it be like it do so i agree" 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:46:17
I've already explained mining to him
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:57:29
yea of course. but you kinda wasted your 30's with that whole birdwatching phase.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:18:14
and its always worked out in the end

@_date: 2017-05-27 16:13:51

@_date: 2017-05-22 13:50:13

@_date: 2017-05-22 13:12:10
fuck yeah
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:09:51
i am considering the same on this day. risky play for big rewards.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:55:14
honestly im investing right now because im faithful in the deployment of segwit
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:28:12
2 days later: 2500!
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:26:26
why not use a wallet such as electrum? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:33:18
i would definitely include some cryptographic primitives like the commitment scheme. good to understand the foundations of SHA-256 so that one can identify the changes that have/will occur in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:38:48
Seriously not a hot idea to think about trading cryptocurrencies while drunk. drunk/illogical confidence is not good for investments. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:12:15
thats the plan
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:23:56

@_date: 2017-07-25 17:26:39
thank you
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:52:01
The worst thing that can happen is you sell. The best scenario is to always HODL

its marketing. yea its fucked, but look at the publicity that they're receiving. they're happy to see you sharing their news.
