It's still my first year with crypto. Just wondering whether the veterans of you can tell what made Bitcoin recover yesterday.
Apparently, it initially fell due to FUD because of those regulation announcements. So my expectation was that we need something concrete to happen to make it rise again (some announcement or event).
All charts show that those drops apparently happen every January. Therefore, my question is: What made Bitcoin recover in the recent years? Was there a concrete trigger or did it just kind of happen?
Would be really helpful to get a feeling for "is the worst over?" or "what needs to happen to end it?".
Thanks!

It seems quite stable for the moment. rather testing resistance at ~8600 $ than the bottom support. Let's see what the east coast does...

No drop from Sunday to Monday. I am starting to believe it's really getting bullish again.

I don't get the Hodlers' thought process either. I have sometimes sold with a (small) loss to buy back in even deeper. The only way you lose with that strat is if:
a) The price doesn't fall further after your sell (or you miss out on buying back in in time)
b) The price never goes back up again
But if b) is the case all hodling doesn't help either ;-).

Hopefully, that will bring us past the 8600 $ resistance.

Typical weekly pattern. Peak on Friday/early Saturday. Dip starts somewhere between late Saturday to Monday.
Market still easy to scare after the recent bearish weeks. Might be the case here again. I sold yesterday. Expecting drop tomorrow but not as low as this week.

Higher low than yesterday. Still kind of stable. But I feel that if we dont break out to the top soon it's quite likely that the downtrend will continue.

Lucky us to be in a bear market then ;-). But I agree that timing is a bitch and that you have to ask yourself how much stress you are willing to accept/invest...

Seems very similar to what we saw last weekend so far. One day of hope followed by a day where hope slowly declines. 
I'd say it at least needs to break the high of February 5th (~ 8300 $) to somewhat call it a trend reversal. Currently, we are right in the zone where the shorting people dump their stuff. At least that's what I did. Expecting it to go down further but wouldn't be unhappy if it doesn't. Then I'll hop on again at 8350 $.

Why is that?

Pure chaos during the week. Nothing works like clock work - else we'd all be rich.
The fact that we don't bounce up significantly from 8 k but can barely hold it, means no good in my experience.
But as I said. It's chaotic and I was proven wrong a lot in the past too.

Anyone else experiencing issues with the bitstamp trade view? The UI is extremely sluggish for the last couple of days, sometimes even crashing my browser. Occured on 2 devices...
