If everybody used Adblock, there would not be any free content on the Internet. Its important to find ways to get rid of annoying ads, but the right way it not by stealing from content creators.

They give you content if you watch their ads, so they get paid. You read the content, you don't watch the ads, they dont get paid.. Call it what you want. I call it stealing...

Exactly. Thats why i think this idea is cool, because you get rid of the ads, but still support the content creators with small amounts.
