If you're tired of bitcoin politics, there's always litecoin, which is unaffected.

They should be able to refund fiat, I do agree with that part. Otherwise, you're overreacting. Open a chat and tell them you want the cards shipped to your brothers address and to use your store credit. When this happened to me, I received a gift card within minutes of contacting support. No company is perfect and mistakes happen. 
(and I'm being generous by not checking their address policy, which was probably only cancelled as a form of protection anyway.)
Next time check with the companies purchase and return policies before you use them. I have known for a long time that Newegg isn't going to refund you actual coin.
They should be able to refund fiat though, that part is frustrating and not good for business.

1. a state of competition, conflict, or hostility between different people or groups.
"she was at war with her parents"
2. a sustained effort to deal with or end a particular unpleasant or undesirable situation or condition.
Saying "literally" is perfectly correct.

I vote delete. Not positive for bitcoin.

 &gt; I hate Win8 with a passion - the sluggishness of it. 
But yet you continue to use it. I think I figured out the real problem.

Good point. Guess I didn't think about it enough. I was assuming they would refund to a credit/debit card or something, but then that probably opens potential for abuse.

Remind me how many places took bitcoin for payment in 2011. Also, you can simply use xmr.to to anonymously pay anywhere bitcoin is accepted using Monero so that doesn't even matter.

1. Essentially throwing away $120 to what I consider a company that lacks professionalism. 
2. If you don't know how to compile software yourself, you risk an attack executed between manufacturing and the product arriving at your doorstep.
