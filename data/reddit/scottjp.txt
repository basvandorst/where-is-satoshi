A higher price will increase the interest in these coins, or that has been my experience in the past. 
Interestingly, there will be a point where a high BTC price will actually make for a lower Casascius coin price.
If BTC = $1,000,000 for example, I wouldn't expect a coin to fetch more than 1.xx BTC

You will find them in the Goods forum on Bitcointalk fairly regularly. 
There's a nice graded silver 1 BTC for sale at the moment, IIRC.

I think you can by sending the same transaction with a higher fee. However this is beyond my wallet capabilities. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:32:30
Today I accidentally sent a transaction with a slightly smaller than recommended fee. It's now over 6 hours later and it still isn't confirmed.
It was my mistake, but this is not acceptable if we want this to go mainstream.

Ah, of course, RBF.
Though how about GFY?
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:42:10
Yep, they got for quite a lot. Worth waiting till the BTC price picks up a bit before selling; that's my plan anyway.

I've done this with my Facebook friends, I gave out 0.15 BTC to the first three that responded.
Definitely helps to get people educated/involved.
Although, I ended up buying the BTC back from one of them 6 months later :D

Good luck, Charlie and thanks for the lovely Casascius coin =D
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:44:42
It's great that you are willing to do this. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:43:52
Oh God, I remember that. At least there are authorities involved now to shepherd it along.

Please can we all just move to BitMEX for futures?
I'll go first..

There is also a good documentary based on the book.

Is there anything here that will make it more viable for a UK exchange to operate?
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:36:50
As simple as that! 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:31:06
In retrospect, this was the only way this whole charade was going to end.

This could be great news in that if exchanges can prove to banks that they are conforming with the government AML regulations, it will be harder for banks to deny service.

I am a long time Bitcoiner and I support SegWit2x

I seem to be in a minority, but I would be happier just keeping it as it is and moving the decimal whenever there was consensus.
@_date: 2013-01-14 20:13:05
The quickest way for me is to find a trusted seller on bitcointalk.org and transfer £ into their account. Sometimes it only takes minutes to receive BTC.
@_date: 2013-01-29 19:51:48
Where have you found them for sale?
I saw one on Bitmit, but there's none there atm. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 17:03:14
Can anyone post the bet(s) that caused this?
@_date: 2013-01-29 13:19:32
I have seen them go for 2 BTC, but I expect the price to keep increasing. 
I've got a few, but want more!
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:32:22
I reported this yesterday but was served the same advert again today. I've now reported again via a different channel.
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:05:40
Surely orders should be dealt with in the order they are placed, hosted or otherwise. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:06:35
Thank you! Done.

So frustrating how they don't mention which encryption type. 
@_date: 2013-02-09 20:11:31
Ouch! 
With my change I just play the 12% and below options - I expect to lose, then it's awesome when a shiny bitcoin lands in my wallet. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:29:47
I am praying this happens in the next few weeks ;-)
@_date: 2013-01-30 19:52:12
Here is your answer.

These appear to have contributed: 
It seems it was the whale known as Nakowa/charlotte.
