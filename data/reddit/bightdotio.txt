We have been informed at Bight that we need the Bitlicense. We intend not to obtain it and continue our activities in protest. We will be fighting the Bitlicense on legal grounds.

Who cares what this individual thinks of Bitcoin? Whether he likes it or not Bitcoin is here to stay for a long long long time after any skeptic's corpse is dust.

There are uninformed people who claim Bitcoin mining consumes a lot of energy hence it contributes to global warming. The problem is those uninformed people forget that banks contribute more to global warming.

When you decide to send money to someone, you have a choice between a bank account or bitcoin. Let's say you care about the environment so your decision will be based on the carbon footprint of both financial systems. If you choose a bank, you just used a system that contributed 1.6 trillion to fossil fuel. Bitcoin has a lower carbon footprint than any bank.
