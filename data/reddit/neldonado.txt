Why? 
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:54:37
gotcha! Thank you
@_date: 2015-06-10 01:56:26
Do you have your bank account tied to both?
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:16:07
How exactly does it work using this machine? What kind of fees are there?
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:41:54
Why is circle better for "shady transactions"? What makes them different from Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-09-05 21:44:14
I don't. I was just looking for a professional approach to this. I'd like it to be as clean as possible. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:39:31
I was tipped Bitcoin on reddit. I had been lurking for a few months but having someone actually sending me Bitcoin really go me going. Can't wait to start using it! 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:29:44
You want a snorlax instead? @_date: 2014-07-28 14:54:30
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:29:33
@_date: 2014-08-19 20:29:23
Is it safer than just printing your keys and locking them in a safe? What happened if you don't have the website to crack the code? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:32:31
This is cool man, great way to teach people about Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:01:32
Okay thanks! 
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:25:51
Thanks! Have a snorlax! @_date: 2014-07-28 20:27:20
Never installed the first one!
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:51:34
So basically all a wallet does is store the keys for you, and retrieve the amount on any given key? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:48:05
So USD for example? Is that why it says buying Bitcoin from coinbase can take up to a week? And then afterwards I can trade Bitcoin through different exchanges to profit from different rates? Thanks for answering my stupid questions btw 
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:35:08
So different wallets do it differently? And I assume that's why it's a good idea to keep large amounts of money offline? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:59:17
This guy!!! Give him a snorlax!!! @_date: 2014-07-29 19:54:38
Thanks for the info. I do all of that right now, was aware of the password, thanks. I only have a phone wallet to keep 10-15$ on for small Bitcoin purchases. The rest are kept somewhere safe. :-)
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:20:34
Thanks man, this was the most helpful! Have a 24oz ribeye on me. @_date: 2014-07-29 19:22:43
What do you mean root password? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:07:21
It's changetip, you nubskies! But you can send any amount of Bitcoin Anywhere anytime. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:50:29
I DID IT!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:52:31
Have a 24oz ribeye on me! @_date: 2014-07-24 07:16:20
I've read in the EU they are technically supposed to log your data, where in the US it isn't required(yet) of them.
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:24:47
When I go to collect the tip it's saying it's waiting for someone else to collect the tip
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:41:13
So should I write both keys down in case say... My app is deleted? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:19:53
Why does Bitcoin cost differently between things like coinbase/ bitstamp ect? 
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:55:23
I'm not sure if the app has changed in the last week, but I just sent somebody some money and it did show two transactions. One being sent to the receiver and the other was the change being sent back to my bit wallet address. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:24:28
Could you explain what is unsafe about it? I'd like to know incase anyone asks me about the issue. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:58:37
It was a valid question. Better I ask then get scammed! 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:45:23
Okay that kinda makes sense! What is fiat? 
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:31:01
So basically all I need to really care about and protect is the "private key" associated with what ever public address I use? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:10:52
Right on 
@_date: 2014-07-24 04:53:36
What is a seedbox? Sorry I'm a total noob :/
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:49:15
Here's an icp tattoo for you! @_date: 2014-09-03 22:29:40
Convenience really. I was just curious what the risk was.  I have been using the website, but noticed they had an app, which is much more convenient to use on the go.   
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:02:09
Is this secure? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:52:12
Look up the company if you don't believe it!
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:17:22
So would you use it? 
@_date: 2014-08-19 20:22:48
Do you have a good source? I often find things confusing or misleading on the topic of Bitcoin..
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:33:14
I don't use coinbase to store coins, I use it to purchase coins, I store my coins safely, that's why I asked about this app. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:43:14
Well thanks for telling me what it is!
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:59:19
When I buy a "large" sum of Bitcoin ($100 worth) is it safe to keep it on my coinbase account? When do you suggest printing a paper wallet? And how exactly does that work? Thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:01:59
This isn't considered a cash advance by your credit card? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:44:07
Thanks man. Yeah I'm gonna mess around sending it to coin base to get a feel for things before adding more :) 
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:34:12
Ah that makes sense. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:16:35
What does 2FA mean? Thanks!!!
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:51:28
Thanks. I've read up on it and decided to do many smaller sized wallets, so that when ever decided to import I can import the whole wallet. Is that a bad idea? 
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:41:33
Okay, I printed several wallets and am playing around with small amounts. Is it typical for there to be charges to send Bitcoin to another Bitcoin address? I'm using iOS app bit wallet, and it has a 6¢ fee added to every transaction... What's the fee for?!
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:35:24
How do you place a password on a paper wallet? 
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:21:33
Why is running it on an offline system so important? What if I just turn off my wifi while I do all of it? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 22:03:03
Thank you!!
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:15:28
Thank you very much! All is good.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:43:10
I just started using bitwallet for the iPhone, totally recommend to any iPhone users! 
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:09:16
You explained some of what I was asking, but I feel like it has a lot to do with Bitcoin, and this could have been a nice thread for people like me who haven't been following the drama that close the last few days. Maybe you should ease up on the ban/delete hammer? Just an idea. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:21:21
Also, enable 2fa for every purchase or transfer, not just above $500, it may have helped in this situation. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:16:51
Sounds like the perfect storm. :/
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:31:43
I made a change tip account using my Reddit account, but it is asking me to use Facebook or Twitter to sign in. Any ideas? Do I really have to create a new account?
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:22:41
I didn't know that before downloading it, my laptop only has a 64gb SSD so that's not viable. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:53:55
Unfortunately that's what my laptop came with...
