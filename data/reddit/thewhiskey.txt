@_date: 2017-12-21 16:32:29
You were sending from coinbase?!?  Those are coinbase fees!!  And the vendor is using bitpay?? That’s more fees.  This is against bitcoin purpose. If you had done person to person... it would be a different story!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:16:57
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:00
Exactly!! He’s using coinbase.  And vendor is using bitpay.  This is not bitcoin.  If he did it from his own wallet to the vendors wallet.  It would be a different story!

@_date: 2015-12-18 02:47:21
Banks already have a secure system for sharing money.. SWIFT!  Banks already trust each other.  The Blockchain is great for 2 parties that don't trust each other.

Thank!  So the halving is set in stone?
@_date: 2015-12-18 00:11:25
i see.
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:22:58
We are not talking about credit card theft here.  We are talking about bank to bank transfers.  I hope it's clear now.
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:02:51
When the price went over $1000 and people started talking about bitcoin going up to 50,000 or 100,000.. lots of people jumped in at $1000.   If the price goes to $1,000 again, I think it will plummet as many people that held on will try to get out.  I think we will shuttle between $500 and $1,000 a few times before it breaks out to 2,000 or greater.

Thanks.. What if the Trezor breaks or gets lost or malfunctions?  Is there any way to get your coins?
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:49:25
I'll look up their volume.  But I only buy around $200 a week, every week.  For me the transactions are immediate.  I press "buy" and boom there are the coins.  I transfer out immediately, because who know what will happen to Gemini.
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:06:07
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:36:40
I've stopped using Coinbase.  yes, it was my fault that I got booted, but its probably for the better.  Then I wanted to use it to accept bitcoin on my website, but they won't even welcome me back for that.  whatever... there's other ways to sell, buy, and accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:43:23
What data do you write down?  
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:09:57
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:38:16
Unlike Coinbase, it seems you have to actually deposit cash first before buying coin.  On Coinbase, it would withdraw cash from your bank account whenever you bought coin. 
Security seems same with them texting your phone with a code.
@_date: 2015-12-19 04:06:51
What event determines the halving to happen?
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:40:12

@_date: 2015-12-29 22:46:57
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:54:13
Thanks.  I didn't think they could figure out where I was sending.  
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:14:28
Yes.  I'm very sad about it because I love Coinbase.  
Source:  happened to me.   
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:46:44
Why does everyone say Trezor?  Isn't paper wallet the most secure and more long term? 
@_date: 2015-12-18 02:59:53
Nice reply.  So full of facts.  And yes.. banks don't need another system to transfer money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:44
Me too
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:17:12
Is that one of the winklevii?

That looks more Japanese 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:41:15
A few days ago i downloaded my full trading and money transfer history on Gemini.  My buying average is $2k.  I also checked deposits and withdrawals of usd.  I took out more than i put in.  So it’s all good. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:47:37
@_date: 2015-12-17 04:15:37
Yeah this was my question.  When people say the blockchain can be used for other things like this or tracking real estate or titles or wills, etc., do they use the same blockchain that keeps track of bitcoin or is a totally separate blockchain meant for just that other purpose as example given above?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:51:43
It went up 14 times this year.   If it goes up on 8 times in 2018 and then only need it to go up by 2 or 3 in 2019 and 2020.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:28:06
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:32:44
So Gemini is running "illegally"?  Or is that a different license than the ETF?
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:33:59
So far so good. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:38:21
I keep checking with coinbase.  Am paying exactly what I was paying on coinbase before they booted me!
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:25:53
You can bet for or against in a futures market.  Why does everybody on this sub Reddit think that it’s only for betting against.
@_date: 2015-12-02 13:07:53
I buy $100 worth automatically weekly on Coinbase - at whatever the price is.  Its called dollar cost averaging or something like that.
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:58:45
Oh they want to list the ETF on the change.
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:09:38

@_date: 2014-02-26 14:20:30
Mtgox has proven it can make money.   It just has to be run properly. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:57:03
That is always the case in life and that is my saying always.  Never compare.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:15:42
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:46:49
So its not a good idea to quote prices before seeing type and quality and sizes.  Also you're still wrong on tire prices. I understaffed why you don't work there anymore 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:35:16
It kind of makes sense.  If the BTC at mtgox were stolen, it happened over the past few months and the thieves have been slowly selling and that is why the price has been tanking.  Now the "news" is out AFTER all the damage is done, so its all incorporated into the price already. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:29:45
Yes, but these BTC exchanges are not loaning any money so yes they should only operate on their own profits.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:58:47
They have not stated anything is lost.  Keep a cool head until you have facts.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:06:33
Exactly what I said. l
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:17:17
Unless it's online.
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:24:09
Seriously.. no other uses?
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:08:34
I don't know why u r getting down voted.   Not being able to spend it anywhere is the biggest problem.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:06:00
well.. i checked with them and they can direct each 1 Th/s to different worker/mining pool.  So there is no question of splitting the payouts, you would get yours automatically.
Which place offers the best cloud hashing prices?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:01:05
Yes again you're addressing the next step - protection.  I'm talking of just theft.
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:11:20
Well it IS used for illicit dealings
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:36:37
I'm not talking about just buying.  I'm talking about "use".
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:04:39
I don't know how you can say that with complete certainty.   I don't know if it ever will, but it might.  Who would've thought it would come this far?
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:32:21
I guess the Sacremento Kings are money launderers. And overstock.com and others too.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:10:03
Every other post is from people saying "why can't I buy from MtGox and sell at Coinbase".  I wish people would just take a little time and read like 4 or 5 prior posts, and you will see the same question over and over.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:06:25
I don't think Gox will go from "we are working with blockchain.info to fix our problems" to "we are shutting down" in 4 days time.
Just hang in there.. your investment was never meant to be short term.  Did you get in at 1200?
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:44:20
Uh no.   You see that mentality in stocks also.  For example if a huge tech company announces below expectation numbers,  it drags the whole tech industry stocks down.   Sheep mentality.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:19:39
Sorry and Thank you.

@_date: 2014-03-21 22:48:19
People who are downvoting this, can you explain why you don't agree rather than just pressing that down arrow? (I really want to hear both sides)
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:40:25
I can sell u mine
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:17:02
But if price keeps going down then investing in better hardware would make the returns more difficult.  I upvoted you anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:38:32

@_date: 2014-03-22 02:42:06
Adoption, well lack of, is my biggest fear.  
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:07:58
Thanks.  But my question is more about are they using bitcoin block chain directly for other uses or are they replicating the technology for other uses?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:44:19
Meltdown? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:39:45
If you do indeed switch, make sure you use the apps Smoothsync from Google play store.   It will allow you to keep using i Cloud.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:41:59
So what are the 400 ?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:55:23
Regardless of the protection, theft in either case is possible.  You're talking talking about step 2.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:01:14
Let's not jump to the extremes.  No one is saying ignore the problems, but at the same time, with so many exchanges and more and more people getting on the bitcoin bandwagon, its getting hard for ONE party to destroy it.  Also, you mention "inherent" flaws, yet give no examples.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:45:37
I'm sorry to hear that.   Are you stuck in gox? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:08:19
Agreed.  I thought it was stupid after I posted.  I can remove it if it'll make you happier.  :)
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:22:30
ok whomever.. but i think that's where the push needs to be.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:52:20
dumb fuck? classy! So what are you doing on r/bitcoin?  Get the hell out of here, before its too late.. runnnnn.. runnn farrrr awwwaaayyyy
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:38:07
+20 reddcoins
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:22:09
agreed.  but with all this talk of ATMs, etc. coming out that should fuel interest in BTC in the common not techie people.
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:19:56
Sure.  Ok.  Have a good day. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:48:27
I posted this last week and even went to an event.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:52:01
I never said it was a lot or little.  It is what it is.
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:28:48
proof? of anything?  And if there is indeed proof, why don't McConnel and Boehner who hate obama so much take this to some kind of legal action or to the FEC?
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:57:40
Good advice.  i should just put away in paper wallet and leave them in my safe deposit box at the bank.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:40:18
People who believe it's a scam or a Ponza scheme or want to see it fail because it's something new and they can't get their head around it.

@_date: 2014-02-15 13:48:38
Yah maybe.. but who knows. Maybe that 0.003 will really actually help him out.  And 0.003 is just 2 dollars.   Hell we all go out drinking and eating and don't care what the bill is at the end.    So once in a while you don't judge people as to why they are asking  and just give. He might have made a fool of me or he might have really needed it. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:05:58
Mtgox IS bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:11:33
Yeah I mean besides of course some crazy event.

Yes, i guess the amount of interest is not in question, but the concept.  So, how can one get interest on their bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:35:44


@_date: 2014-02-13 00:00:57
Thanks.  But again you are forgetting about the tires. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:04:30
And you even admitted earlier that the wheel size and type of black wheels I have are more expensive than regulars.  You really don't know what u r talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:13:26
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:34:36
I guess some new coin for tipping.  Someone gave it to me so I passed some on.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:09:35
I sold some at 680 a few days ago and now I am buying more at 625.  So its all good.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:40:56
Fear. "Get out now" mentality.

@_date: 2014-02-13 05:02:04
$150 per tire??? Hahahahah u can't even get a 18" tire for my regular AMG wheels for under 400 per tire.  Also you cant get my asanti wheels for 1000 each. What r u smoking?  I'm wasting my time.  You have really shown you incompetance. No wonder you are not in this business anymore.  Oh my god.. so funny. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:01:32
It's still in its infancy.  I think it may go to $10 again before making a roaring comeback into wide acceptance.   But it will happen.   The worst thing I think can happen is the federal reserve adopting this and making the US$ into a digital currency. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:37:12
It means I'm somewhat educated.

When I got the mercedes NEW in 2011, the wheels were already on it.  Why? the wheels were ordered for an athlete but he never picked up the car.  So, I don't know if they were custom.   I took the car from Mercedes of South Orlando.  Still have the receipt, but thanks for the hustling accusation.  
Yes, the wheels were only $ 8k, but don't forget the tires - those things are pricey.  I'm just saying that to make sure you don't hustle people since you know asanti wheels, so well.  
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:22:02
I was hoping for a better discussion instead username and personal insults.  But whatever floats your boat.
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:46:29
He mean, even though the fiat is not appreciating, he is getting interest on it when he banks it.  But on bitcoin, you are not getting interest, but appreciation of its value. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:55:46
Each tire alone is over a thousand.   But I'm sure you know that already.   So tires alone are $4000.  So you're telling me the 4 wheels are only 2k?  U don't know what you are talking about.

That's your input on this thread?  
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:53:10
What is this? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:56:53
Ok thank you.  Not much going on today for you huh?  You can keep writing in this thread, I don't mind.  Everyone is welcome.  
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:39:39
that's not what he said at all.  Accounts related to bitcoins is not the ONLY factor.
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:42:41
Thanks.  But its nothing the user sees? They are just tools for merchants and stuff?
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:04:38
Comments like this always remind me of quotes like "no one wants a computer in their home" or "the telephone is just a toy"

If we had $500 homes then then the pay would be less.  Look back 100 years ago.  I guess you didn't get his point.

Thanks.. will check it out.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:55:31
So was the internet.  you had to put all those modem commands for parity and shit.  It will get better.  "People don't need a computer in their home.".  "Hardware is where the money is.  No one cares about software."
famous last words.
But I do get what you are saying.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:18:57
And your argument is?
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:54:57
no problem.  pay it forward somehow.. even though its little.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:48:15

Yeah that's a different and a possible real scenario.  Gov intervention could destroy it.

Look up Bitcoin Center NYC
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:28:39
I disagree.  Maybe you didn't deal in high end stuff is what it sounds like.  And you used to deal in them, not anymore.  Maybe you weren't good enough.  Tell me, what are the sizes of the rear wheels and the front wheels for 22" inch, since you are such an expert.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:38:12
Well.. maybe in the future teddy bear is slang for some future meth type drug
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:02:48
I personally think that the biggest problem is that you really can't do anything with bitcoin.  Hell even in Manhattan (where I live), I couldn't buy a beer to show my friend how bitcoin works.  Yes there are two bars, but they open after 4pm and they are more like clubs.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:02:27

@_date: 2014-03-10 00:14:49
I think 1,000 will be a limit for some time, because we are humans and a lot of people will sell at 1,000 as a mental limit.  I think the price will hover between 700 and 1000 for some 6 months or so before we see it break out to max of 1,500 at the end of the year.
Unless of course someone like Amazon, Ebay, Walmart or Apple or Google adopt it as a payment.. then TO THE MOO.. well you know where.

@_date: 2014-02-12 23:44:36
do we have one for buying/selling with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:20:00
I don't know what you're trying to prove. Mine are not straight chrome.  Read again. Even by your breakdown, you don't get your $6500 for 4 wheels of my size and my tires as you stated earlier. You may know tires but you don't know math or business.  I'm the one actually owning them and the $105k car remember?  Along with my California and Flying Spur.   Good luck in life.  You won't last long with those math skills.  Take care.  I'm done here.

I don't know why you got downvoted.  This is the exact meaning.

"self-aware"?  Please explain.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:35:59
Right I was thinking the same.  What if you build an exchange, take in all these BTCs, then show one of your friends how to hack it and share the loot later.
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:38:42

What is this?
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:18:09
So when I am sending money to someone, the sending depends on new blocks being found?

What if the seller never confirms to you that they received the funds and the buyer has emailed you the deposit receipt?
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:49:20
but when you read r/bitcoinmining everyone talks about difficulty going through the roof due to all those TH/s of miners coming on line in next 3-4 months.

Amazing that all these people typing out "search" or "read FAQ" instead of just explaining and being a nice community.   Sorry.   Thanks to the people who did a answer though.  The reason to stay in mining is transaction fees is what I understand.

Ok so you're upto 8500 now.  From 6000 to 8500.  And you're way off on the tires btw.   You'll soon realize that too like you did on the wheels.  No wonder you didn't last in that business.  I'm sorry.

Fiat to BTC is a rate.  So, if fiat crashes, then comparatively the BTC would go up.

That's true too.. people panic.

Yeah that's why I don't wanna ask
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:31:12
.002 on how much deposit?
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:16:30
That wasn't the issue in this discussion.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:55:43
yeah I tried that.. only found 2.  One opens at 5pm and other is WAYyyyyy downtown.  I wanted to show my friend from FL who is visiting on Thursday at lunch how btw can be used in the real world.  
So, I see from this experience, we need to start getting businesses to use BTC more.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:22:47
1. The Government can't print more bitcoins and devalue them.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:31:04
thanks, but giving a definition does not answer the original question. My sister is like you, she will say something that is related to the topic, but not exactly relevant to the discussion.  But anyway, fiat can be deposited into a bank for interest.  So, what is a SAFE place to deposit bitcoins for interest? 
Going back to the original question that was posted, doesn't the interest earned in a bank on fiat offset the appreciation of bitcoin?  I don't agree to it, but I was just clarifying his question.
@_date: 2017-02-02 13:32:34

@_date: 2017-01-02 13:19:20
Too much too fast compared to what?  You can't think like it's a stock where the price is overvalued compared to PE, earnings, etc.   Bitcoin cannot be valued like that.  It's a fixed and finite commodity with acceptance growing daily.  There's only going to be 21 million Bitcoins ever.  It's great for foreign exchange and for storing value.  
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:46:12
This comparison doesn't make any sense.  Need to look at total market value.  Gold is in the trillions.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:16:47

@_date: 2017-01-07 13:20:24
Right but you'd be Averaging on a monthly basis then instead of on a daily basis. Either way you're averaging over some set time on some interval.  My question is whether the intervals matter as long as they are on a consistent basis.

Localbitcoins.com is what they mean. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:36:20
Yes it is the issue.. but its different and different valuations.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:59:06
The question doesn't make sense to me.   Nakamoto could have easily had the whole different than it is now by one decimal.  So instead of 21 million Bitcoins, we would have 210 million Bitcoins with it divisible to 1/10million instead of the current 1/100million.
If this was the case then the price of one Bitcoin had already passed 1 BTC per dollar compared to 1 ounce of gold per dollar.
I think the real question is will all of Bitcoin ever be worth all of the gold there is. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:28:54
Yes for now. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:19:24

Oh.  You said you ARE buying.  If it goes to 700 I'll pick up more.  Then again at 650 then at 600 down to 200 :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:00:39
Thanks.  Any idea on how Gemini stores?
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:08:18
I don't worry about price.. I just buy $100 everyday at 7am.
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:37:45
Yesterday there were lots of posts about it
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:46:09
Plunge ��
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:58:12
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:43:37
That's hardly a slide
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:53:58
Good question.  I look forward to the replies.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:18:28
Sell?  Shit I'm buying more today!  I'll reach that goal of 21 coins faster than I thought!
@_date: 2016-12-25 13:23:59
But the each Satoshi would be worth a significant amount thus making one BTC worth a lot.
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:53:55
Not spamming.  Just letting people know this is out there.
@_date: 2017-01-07 22:10:09
Dance dance!
(Sorry had to do it)
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:41:46
I understand but I figured they would even out to the same on both exchanges.
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:12:06
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:41:17
Thanks for the useless comment.  I know there is no money in mining.  I was talking about transaction fees.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:15:01
Thanks 
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:21:37
Buy $100 at regular intervals.  I'm doing $100 per day for 20 days.  It's hard not to get stressed when prices go down and it's hard not to sell when prices go up.   But that's where the discipline comes in.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:29:44
Because enough people aren't buying.. quite simple.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:40:11
Thank you very much for answering this question.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:13:15
Thanks will check it out 
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:52:05
Now that's a slide!
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:19:35
Comparing price per unit is irrelevant because the units are arbitrary.   Gold has a total value today of over $6 trillion.
Each bitcoin (assuming all 21 million), would have to be worth $285,714 to match gold.
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:30:32
Thanks so much for clearing that up.  Also thanks for your patience and taking the time to type all that.  Do nodes get paid anything?  Like transaction fees?  
Are "confirmations" just verifications from each node?  So if one node verifies, it's one confirmation? Does that verification get broadcast to all other nodes?
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:05:23
Its not a scam. You have no right to say that.  Yes I use the same number because that's how to reach me - duh!  
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:14:22
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:29:08
I'm using it and it's fine.  Just make sure you turn off the "withdrawals" when creating a new API.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:45:36
On bittrex it's BCC
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:14:13
Ok.  Will stop using electrum. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:01:09
I actually would restart it just to be a "part" of it.  :)
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:23:38
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:38:56
ok.  Sorry you don't understand.  Others have answered already.  If you want to have the last word, go ahead, I won't reply after that.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:37:07
That was just people panicking before the fork
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:17:03
Where do you see 700?  I'm not seeing that on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:17:50
That's what I use.  I love Gemini!
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:46:17
My goal is to have 21 by end of year.  At current price levels it should take me 6 months with daily  buying. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:24:02
Just buy a bit on regular intervals.   Daily or weekly or monthly, etc
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:50:13
got it. Thank for the explanations.  If bitcoin transactions do increase and fees are needed to push the transaction through, maybe there is a future there.  :)
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:21:36
Buy $100 at regular intervals.  I'm doing $100 per day for 20 days.  It's hard not to get stressed when prices go down and it's hard not to sell when prices go up.   But that's where the discipline comes in.
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:07:12
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:58:56
What if I told you "$3400 is cheap". What if when it was $2k I told you it was cheap or at $1k?
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:52:15
How does a Node verify a transaction?  Then how does it let other nodes and miners know it verified it?
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:44:25
How do I know if it's compatible?
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:35:13

Agreed. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:34:36
It's helping me be cool headed with dollar cost averaging.   I'm not impulsively buying or selling because of drastic price changes. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:45:17
When a new bitcoin is "generated" from the 21 million bitcoins, I thought that is the reward to finding the hash.  But what about transaction fees that are added?
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:34:00
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:57:35
What's low?
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:53:56
I see two addresses:  1Ly2kYtUfqC2qA35ZveeZrwqt45iitB2pn and 1FeidfxNeF18GtRpjDcjaRxNDtnDqPF8sn.  So I am not sure what you are talking about.  Pay one of these and see if we are scam or not. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:48:41
Dude.. its not a scam.  That's why we put our phone number on it.  Thanks for the heads up for the SSL.  So the address didn't change when you tried multiple order?
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:13:44
That's not the question.  Let's say you lose your computer or phone or have to format it or whatever.  So can you install ANY Wallet and just put in the key?
Edit:  other comments have answered this.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:28:46
My question was simple. "Can you use seed from one wallet on another wallet?" 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:39:29
Thanks.. but I'm talking about the app that's for iOS, not Bittrex itself.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:34:13
You are awesome!  Thanks so much.  So this verification is done BEFORE the transaction is packaged up in a block which is attached to the Blockchain?  And the attachment happens by miners looking for a nonce that will give them a hash with the predetermined format. Right?
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:30:29
To the people saying the price is high or has risen too fast, why wasn't it high when it went from 700 to 800?  Answer is, this is no answer.  There is no earnings or PE etc like for a stock that you can use for Bitcoin.  It's worth what's it worth. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:32:29
I started buying at $700s, then 800s and even bought some at $910. So I feel you, but now, I'm doing dollar cost averaging of $100 per day on Gemini.  I buy $100 every morning at 7:30am.   You can't time the market.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:04:46
Because a red porcupine doesn't play chess
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:43:12
Then my comment is not for you.  :). It was for people who want it to be over $1000.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:58:11
I apologize, I thought I was answering someone else.  I've deleted my comments.  
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:31:05
Except Monero.
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:30:06
I'm worried they will do something shady and the price will come crashing down. 
@_date: 2019-08-17 08:39:55
Create a new account and try again.  I was verified in a few hours.
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:42:34
Thanks for the reply.   I know the block reward is very difficult now, so I was asking about transaction fees.  When people send bitcoin and they choose to add a transaction fee, where does that transaction fee go?  To the pool?
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:31:04
I started buying at $700s, then 800s and even bought some at $910.  Now, I'm doing dollar cost averaging of $100 per day on Gemini.  I buy $100 every morning at 7:30am.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:01:56
Thanks for the replies.
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:52:42
how do you calculate that?
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:38:00
People said the same thing about $1 or $100 when it was just a fraction of a penny.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:30:36
Coinbase or Gemini

I️ don’t know much except I️ think the price is going up because everyone (including me) is stocking up on btc for the fork - aka free 2Xcoin. 
I’m worried about the crash right after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:45:34
Tulips die.  They can’t be sent across the globe for payment or currency exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:29:21
People have been thinking that since $200.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:06:33
Are they going straight between btc and bch or going to USDT first?

@_date: 2017-11-21 14:25:46
how do you do that?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:47:45
Well I went to blockchain.info and on one of my empty wallets I clicked on sign message and hot a string or has or something.  Would I send that to someone to prove that its my wallet?  If so, what do they do with that string?

@_date: 2017-11-02 05:00:09
That’s what I’m thinking... but when to sell? Will we know exactly the minute the fork happens??
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:14:32
It’s because of that phrase... i see.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:47:46
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:54:35
But how do you do all that? :). sorry if I'm being stupid.  Where do you go to do this?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:57:38

But on every dip.  Then double down. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:39:27
What’s low?  No one knows.  So you keep buying on way down.  :)

Buy $500 everyday or $250 everyday.  Be disciplined on this. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:03:38
It's just a tool!! To get around usd funds.  Just a made up coin.. to handle conversions between coins.  There's no due diligence required.
For example, I cannot move tether from bittrex to my bank account right?  I have to convert to btc then transfer to gemini or coinbase then sell and then get my usd.
Tether is just a trading and exchange tool.

$7k by dec 31st
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:18:34

@_date: 2017-10-31 15:12:58
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:43:05
Just buy a little everyday.  If you have $10,000 to invest, buy like $500 everyday.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:33:04
I buy $100 a day.  If the price drops by $100 in 24 hours I double my buy and I keep doubling as long as I can take it as it drops.  If it stays in the $100 range I stay at the new buying quantity.  If it stays same for 3 days I reset at $100 a day. 
If the price goes up by $100 I reduce by $50.  if it goes up or stays the same for 3 days straight I reset at $100 a day.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:31:24
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:31:56
But btc is not just sold to your friend.  It’s traded on many exchanges for USD and you can readily and actively buy/sell at the current price. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:43:31
Same here!!
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:26:44
Imagine a “thing” which gets it value from it not being able to be duplicated and has limited quantity.  (Like gold).  First thing is to understand this concept. 
Once you wrap your head around that.. next question is how is that achieved?
Good question!!! It’s achieved through a distributed “general ledger” which resides on millions of computers which verify each transactions and keeps tracks of everyone’s “balance”.  These entries are accessed through public keys and private keys.  This general ledger is called a blockchain.   A bunch of transactions are packaged into a block and attached to the previous block to form this “blockchain”. 
What do you guys think?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:24:03

Privacy can’t be bolted on. Monero is indeed a serious coin with serious PhD’s working in the Monero Research Lab which is funded by the community. It won’t beat bitcoin... but it’s worth having.    It’s at $72 right now.   (Typing that in to refer to it later. )
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:10:36
Ok thanks.. just to be safe I’m moving everything to my own wallet.  
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:03:10
Don't worry about dip.  Just buy weekly or monthly or whatever frequency suits you.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:48:17
Agreed.  All these stupid alt coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:18:30
I knew an indian doctor in Pittsburgh that sold everything when the Microsoft IPO came out.  He’s worth like $500 million now. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:01:14
Yep.  That’s me.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:53:35
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:59:46
No. I told my relatives a few weeks ago to buy at $3500.  They didn’t because it was “too high”
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:56:28
My comments around 2 months ago.
@_date: 2016-10-24 10:59:25
About 40 BTC 
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:06:30
So people listing on Localbitcoins might be a sting operation?
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:34:18
Why does that matter?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:39:45
Their fees are ridiculous. Gemini is so cheap.
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:06:23
I don’t think that was gemini 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:55:05
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:27:30
Thanks. How will this affect ETH?
@_date: 2015-11-29 17:23:05
I never got my stuff and coinbase banned my account. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:59:38
The article proposes that if an altcoin has a useful new feature, then someone would build that for Bitcoin.   So how about for example Ethererium? Can Bitcoin do Smart Contracts?
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:44:20
Thanks for replying.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:38:36
Ok for example.. on coinbase if you buy one BTC, you pay $49 for fees. On Gemini you pay like $6.90.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:07:47
I see.  How does a hard fork protect the founders?  So are they in ETC or ETC classic?
Edit: downvoted for asking a question?
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:42:20
And the price of each btc is always higher on coinbase.  They fuck you.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:51:50
I live in manhattan.. so I guess I could!
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:23:18
He is not Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:23:13
I am banned from Coinbase and I got it!
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:27:20
Yeah but historically there weren't all these legit and licensed exchanges that we have now. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:02:27
@_date: 2016-10-24 12:55:00
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:39:41
So holding them in Electrum is better than leaving them on Gemini?
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:43:28
Ok how about outside of Localbitcoins?  Is one allowed to buy/sell bitcoins in Nyc?
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:29:35
But hardforks means 2 separate coins?
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:14:32
If there is a fork, do we take the road less travelled?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:38:49
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:23:20
No.  That's not it.  People here want cryptography proof. Who cares if he is Dali lama or Donald trump like.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:11:12
Did the fork happen?
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:39:07
Thank you
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:44:01
Wouldn't the hard fork delegitimize Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:22:23
I don't think that.. I was referring to the article.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:40:25
Thanks.  Where do we get a BCC wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:48:43
So you guys are leaving your BTC on this exchange?  
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:16:43
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:47:46
I don't think you'll be able to access BCC through BTC wallet.  
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:05:36
Why would he lie about that?  I bought 3 BTC under 2100 today.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:43:10
Let's see.  I buy everyday.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:03:19
Thanks.  
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:40:26
"Yours" ?
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:49:18
Thanks.. but where do you get a BCC wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:41:19
I am also still confused about whether a BCC wallet will take the seed from Electrum.  Any idea?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:11:20
But it says no split chain detected.  I'm not really sure how to read that.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:27:26
Yep!  Buy everyday
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:20:53
Do some research.  Monero has the brightest PhDs working on it.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:34:05
how about blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:52:51
I see.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:56:19
It literally is the top post:
August 1, 2017: What happens to our bitcoins during a hard fork? [Explained]
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:46:53
He's a genius
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:13:33
For sure?
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:17:16
I think that's terrible 
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:41:19
Why would one choose non HD when creating a new wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:06:28
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:15:56
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:54:13
Why would it fork?
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:39:59
No monero?
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:21:04
When will they learn.
