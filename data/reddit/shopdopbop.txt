I've been hodl-ing since 2013 (got in for small potatoes but it's done well, obviously). The only other bet I've made was ETH at sub 10 dollars... so that's done well too. Otherwise I've ignored alts.
This BCH and BTG airdrop of my old coins though, did something interesting for me. I'm a believer in market share, and I think BTC is going to be the wise choice for years to come just by nature of how much momentum it has. That being said, rather than just convert my magic new found BCH and BTG back to BTC and move on, I've decided to grab some alt's for the first time ever. I've distributed my BCH and BTG across 10 or so alts, with like, 2/3rds of it going to IOTA.
I'm worried that I'm gonna get addicted to watching and playing with alt coins, and moving funds back and forth amongst them. I've been a hodl'r for 4 years, this is the first time I've ever actively done market things and it's exciting... But it's nice to know that because of BCH and BTG Airdrop, I can play with other markets, without either putting in more fiat, or ever going under in the amount of BTC I've been hodl-ing.

I traded in all my BCH and BTG, because I don't really see either being different enough to overcome the momentum of BTC.
SO, let's say you have all your btc in address 1.
1) Make a new address of your preferred type. Let's call that address 2.
2) Transfer all your btc from address 1 to address 2.
3) Download a wallet that supports BCH and BTG. I used coinomi.
4) Sweep your OLD address (address 1) for BCH and BTG. This is safe because, now that your BTC is in address 2, worse case scenario, you lose your bch and btg.
5) Now address 1 that was swept has bch, and btg. Transfer to an exchange that takes them.
6) Exchange for BTC, or whatever you want. Withdrawl, daytrade, draw smily faces on your laptop screen... at this point you can do whatever.
