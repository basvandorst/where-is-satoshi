What kind of miner setup do you have?
Any idea what the initial investment ballpark is for someone with none of the hardware?

We're in that confused stage of development where people don't know what to make of it but they know it's the next "thing" so they want in.
It was the same when the internet first came about. Confusion for a long while, then massive media attention as it's usefulness became apparent. But even then the internet still looked like what we consider old 90's style.
We're currently in those days of crypto. Media attention an everyone getting in on it, but nothing really "just works" yet. The googles and facebooks of bitcoin/crypto haven't been created yet.

Awesome, thanks for the info!
Do you think it's worth getting just one ASIC miner? I'm looking at nicehash and the projected payouts for the l3+ aren't bad.

The business he'd lose from not using coinbase is way more than he'll lose in fees.

Kinda neutral. Obviously they had to stay generic. Basically saying it's a gamble right now and to be responsible and vigilant so you don't get stuck in scams like bitconnect.

He surprisingly knows a lot, actually. I was kinda shocked at first too when I realized he was a major investor in a lot of successful technology startups. He does a lot of talks at technology events.
