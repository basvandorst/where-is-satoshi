This is one of cavirtex's monstrosities. Most of these machines are broken 90% of the time and when they are working, charge a 10% fee. 
To add insult to injury, if the cavirtex price is lower than other exchanges, they will use the price of other exchanges that are higher and add on their 10% fee.

This has been known for a while. There are many quality mixing sites out there that I would recommend.

Save yourself the trouble and avoid this horrible company. After you deposit they'll freeze your funds for 2 weeks. 
There are multiple better options in Canada

Rumors on reddit that the US government will be targeting organizations that issue tokens, currency or other forms of securities without being properly registered with FINCEN and other related government agencies.
At this point there has been no credible evidence to back up these claims.

There are a few ways
Exchanges: Put your coins in BTCE and then withdraw. 
Mixers: Crypt0mixer.com and BitcoinFog
The downside of both of these options is that your coins may come out dirtier than they went in ;p

Most of this talk has over to the Bitcoin Markets sub, where the speculators hang out. 
I find it entertaining when people say that the current price is due to manipulation. Sure you can manipulate the price slightly, by dumping a bunch of coins, but it is nearly impossible to move the market and hold it down for a lengthy period of time. Manipulation is when you see a 10% swing on one exchange but not the others... not when you see steady declines for months on end.
