It's called an ATM... You can literally find a BTC ATM anywhere, it's not just in Saudi Arabia. There are literally 5 ATM's within 10 KM's of me that sell BTC @ 9.5%.

Go to bitaddress.org and create one, I watched a few YouTube videos a day or two ago on how to do it, very easy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:45:58
Next time try 0.0003, takes about a day to go through but very low and works on viaBTC.

Age doesn’t make a difference, you can be 15 years old or 50 years old, as long as you know the risk and do lots of research and only invest money you’re okay with loosing it’s fine, it’s actually better to invest when your young and learn so that when you’re older it’s easier, also because when your young you can take more risks, you don’t need to worry about paying rent or bills.
The vision behind bitcoin is that it becomes a currency all can use, not something limited to investors.

Steam stopped supporting BTC through their payment platform to purchase games but third party bots are still up and active. Different things.

Hey bud, 15 year old here. Thought I’d reply since your getting very toxic replies, here’s what I do. You loose a little on fees but it’s worth it.
Purchase CS:GO keys from OPSkins via PayPal, if you don’t have a credit/debit card buy a prepaid one with cash from a store and add it to your PayPal as a gift card. Once the keys are in your steam account sell it to someone else or a key bot. 
If your not familiar with steam or how to use OPSkins feel free to message me, you can buy keys for $1.77 / Per at the current rate and bots buy at 1.69. You loose 8 cents per key and 0.0003BTC for transaction fees but there really is no other way unless you give your parents cash and use their bank/card.

I’m not saying go out and bet all your money on random crypto’s and stocks or go sky diving, I’m saying it’s okay to invest a few dollars here and there so he can learn more about it. I’m currently in High School and they’re some kids that are investing in stocks and some that just blow all their money on weed.

Agreed, if the dude has a tier 4 corporate account and investing 200k I’m sure he has plenty of money left over to sustain himself. Also OP in regards to your question make sure you document everything. All support tickets all responses so in the case they don’t give you your money you can take them to court. Try DM’ing some of their staff on twitter and keep on making support tickets.

If you have free electricity, it’s basically just printing money, no reason not to!

@_date: 2017-10-18 14:37:40
Depends, personally if I were you, I'd sell half to treat yourself to a nice vacation and keep the other half as an investment.
