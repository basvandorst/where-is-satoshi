Misleading title.  They are just making trading users identifiable.  They are trying to crack down on tax fraud and money laundering with anonymous accounts on exchanges.  Exchange users will no longer be anonymous.
But anyways who cares.  Those trying to use crypto for illegal means will still be able to do so through foreign exchanges and private coins, especially as crypto becomes more widely adopted.

This really is true.  Money flows into bitcoin first and then trickles into alts.  I also find the PoS thing flawed.  Every PoS coin is actually backed by PoW (BTC).  You can't make something out of nothing, or add value to something out of nothing. 
The flow of crypto interest is BTC &gt; Alt Coins &gt; BTC.

You can't claim bitcoin transactions require 800,000 times more electricity because that's not true.  The entire chain could be secured by 10 computers.  Electricity scaling reflects profitability from mining.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:03:59
I somewhat disagree.  Hardware and electricity secure the network.  While they do not directly influence the price, they allow the coin to hold value because without a secure network, the coin is worthless.  The price can't exist without the security miners provide.
Having said that, I'd say there is more of a correlation in electricity usage based on price rather than the other way around.  As prices go up, more miners will enter.

Well here the thing, at that point it wouldn't need to be converted.  But one thing we all know is the value of right now is the dollar.  So obviously the value of bitcoin will be compared to it.
Bitcoin isn't necessary in America except for individuals that like to make overseas payments.  Where it really has potential to shine is countries like Venezuela where hyperinflation is taking place.  Poor countries with shitty governments and shitty currencies are better putting their money in cryptos.  Even if bitcoin tanked 90% over the next year, a citizen in Venezuela would have retained more value by buying bitcoin.

I don't see how it's silly to spend bitcoin.  It's like spending any other currency.  And we have to start somewhere.  Also did you see there is a bill in the works in the US that will prevent the requirement of paying capital gain taxes on crypto purchases under $600?
It is here to stay, and it is here to grow.  Countries with crap currencies are going to further flock to bitcoin as accessibility increases.  Just because the early days are rough, and make no mistake these are the early days, doesn't mean it won't smooth out over time.  Also you will always need FIAT to buy crypto in the foreseeable future.  Crypto isn't anti-fiat, it works with it and surpasses borders and the fees associated with them.

You're approaching it from a point of view that bitcoin's ideal end-state is to replace traditional currencies.  I don't believe that is a realistic expectation either.  No government will readily give up their own control over their primary currency.
Bitcoin does have it's uses.  It's a great way to store value in failing governments and failing economies.  Additionally it's the most efficient way to transfer money overseas almost instantly for minimal fees.  It also takes money out of the hands of banks.  In America, that's not really a big deal as we like the security our banks provide.  But in other countries where access to banks is limited or not worthwhile, storing money in bitcoin is a good way to go.
Really I think it has tremendous potential to be used along side fiat currencies, and it will become more stable as it grows.  Some regulation is definitely required, but it can't defeat the purpose of bitcoin being a government-less currency.
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:42:59
Yeah because Monero can easily be associated with criminals.  It's perceived as sketchy whether or not it is.  That would be some bad press for Amazon.  I bet they have the greatest chance of using bitcoin, followed by ETH or LTC.

I would agree.  But I still don't see how PoS is economically sound at all.  The entire concept of it hurts liquidity, encourages excessive holding, and is inflationary in nature.  Many people accuse Bitcoin of being a pyramid scheme, however it is backed by very expensive capital and electric use (work). PoS coins are the true pyramids when they aren't backed by anything other than themselves.  It's like owning a stock that just goes up for the sake of going up.

There is a lot of potential for Amazon to begin taking crypto.  On average credit card companies charge vendors around 1.5% per transaction.  So when you spend $100, VISA gets $1.50.  With crypto these savings will go to Amazon.  Even if Amazon is charged "taker" fees from exchanges to immediately convert to USD, it would still be more beneficial to their bottom line because .1% &lt; 1.5%.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:50:21
It won't.  Even if you take America and China out of the equation and it was somehow completely banned, this won't happen.  Keep in mind that failing currencies and governments are encouraging the growth of bitcoin.  When you experience massive amounts of inflation such as Venezuela (1500% predicted just in 2017), bitcoin could drop from 4500 to $450 and it would still be a better place to store your money.
America and Europe are not who bitcoin is strong for.  As access to cryptocurrencies expands in these poorer countries, it will only continue to grow.

Through coinbase support, I personally requested IMMEDIATE access to both chains after the fork and informed them I considered it fraudulent not to give me access to the original bitcoin I paid for in the event of a split.  Additionally I told them I would not be purchasing any more bitcoin until they can guarantee these things.
