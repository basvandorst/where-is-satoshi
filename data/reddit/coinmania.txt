What you're describing sounds like OpenBazaar, which I think is a very interesting project.  I do see some advantages though in a centralized auction service in terms of customer support and user management (e.g. banning scammers quickly).  I think OpenBazaar will probably cater more towards users looking for an SR alternative, so perhaps there's also room for a more a traditional BTC auction site as well.

You can use my site from anywhere in the world.  You don't have to be a US citizen to use coinbase.  Just create a coinbase account and transfer BTC into it and then use that coinbase account on my site.
I can't do escrow due to government regulation. That could be why BitMit is shutting down - not sure.

Hi brickfrog,  I think that link is broken.  Will Testnet work with a coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:56:24
My auction site uses coinbase as a payment gateway and I have to say, it's amazing.  It's really seamless and super easy to use.  It works just like paypal does with ebay.  You can see it in action at halfpricedigital.com

The good news is that he doesn't need to use Coinbase as an exchange.  He just creates a Coinbase account, sells some of his stuff for BTC that gets sent to his Coinbase account by the buyer and then he can move the coins anywhere he likes or he can leave the coins in his Coinbase wallet if he's comfortable with their security.

Can't do it friend!  My company is based in the UK and you have to get a bunch of licenses to do escrow in the UK (or pretty much anywhere) so that the government knows you aren't scamming.

Also, the site is open to buyers and sellers worldwide.  The items I listed only ship to the USA b/c it would be too expensive for me to ship them internationally for free.

Coinbase also has a great API!  We use it as our Bitcoin payment gateway on halfpricedigital.com - a Bitcoin auction site.

Got it!  Thanks again deinos!

I started a bitcoin auction site HalfPriceDigital.com  You can buy/sell for BTC via coinbase account or you can pay with fiat using PayPal or Skrill.  Let me know what you think!

Hi Polymera, it's b/c the business model is based on a ruling in the EU (UsedSoft v Oracle).  I wanted to make sure that the domain couldn't be confiscated by a country that doesn't recognize that ruling.

halfpricedigital.com is a BTC auction site I recently launched.  You can buy/sell using your coinbase account.  You can also use PayPal or Skrill.

lol stopped watching at "paypal's demise"... Pretty sure paypal basically prints money so I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-09-09 03:09:17
I'll message all of you when the site goes live.  Might be as early as tomorrow!
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:18:43
I started a BTC auction site called halfpricedigital.com  Give it a shot!  You can sell for BTC via coinbase account or use PayPal/Skrill!
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:21:34
I run a bitcoin auction site that uses Coinbase in the same way ebay uses Paypal.  It's incredibly simple for users to pay using their Coinbase account.  Check it out at halfpricedigital.com
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:36:26
Ah, I just got the email a moment ago and didn't see it on the front page of r/bitcoin so I thought I was breaking the story.  Drats.  Oh, well!  Who use the search feature on reddit anyways?  Guess I will be from now on.
@_date: 2013-09-09 02:36:45
Thanks alanX.  I'm hesitant to use test coins as I don't have a lot of BTC experience and want to limit the number of variables I'm dealing with.  My address is XXXXX Will it be easy for me to send the BTC back to you when I finish testing?  Sorry, I'm new to BTC :)
Edit: Deleted address as BTC was donated!  Thanks guys!

I'd rather not say the exact amount that the owner of bitmit was willing to sell for, as that figure may have changed.  If you're interested in buying bitmit, I'd encourage you to contact the owner - he will most likely respond to your inquiry.
Someone posted an email from the owner of BitMit here regarding stats for the site 
@_date: 2013-09-09 03:28:17
Awesome!  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:56:48
I run a bitmit alternative called halfpricedigital.com  My site has a coinbase API that allows you to buy/sell with BTC.  It's really simple to use.  Or you can use a 3rd party escrow service of your choosing.
I contacted BitMit about buying their site, but I thought their price was too expensive - in the six figures.
@_date: 2013-10-01 20:34:08
If you're looking for an alternative to Bitmit try halfpricedigital.com  You can sell your used games &amp; software for BTC or fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-09-09 03:01:09
You rock deinos!  Thanks, this is a big help!
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:52:00
If you want an easy way to get bitcoins fast, sell some of your used stuff for btc on my auction site halfpricedigital.com  You just need a free Coinbase.com account
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:40:34
I've put one together.  Give halfpricedigital.com a try.  You can buy/sell for BTC via your coinbase account.  It's as easy as using PayPal on ebay.  If you want to use escrow, you can via a trusted 3rd party escrow service of your choosing.
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:06:10
I've just added the ability to buy &amp; sell items on my auction site for BTC via Coinbase.  You can also buy &amp; sell for fiat currency using PayPal or Skrill.  My site is focused on used software &amp; games.  EU citizens can even resell software that has a TOS/EULA forbidding resale thanks to the UsedSoft v. Oracle ruling.  Your feedback is welcome!
