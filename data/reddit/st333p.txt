That's the way we do in Europe. Dot to highlight thausands and comma for decimals. It's not more wrong than using ounces instead of kilograms...

I actually agree on the 'voting' part. In case of a fork of the chain you should decide which branch to follow thus voting for one of the options.

They're stable compared to something else, not in a general sense

I'd say the first four points are there for lightning, for the 5 there is a long way to go. (you can discuss about decentralisation but really we don't know until it reaches mass adoption) 
The major challenge I see is usability. Lightning concepts are far from what we are used to in financial applications. Whoever can hide all this from the end user will probably make lightning successful. 
And here we're lagging badly (my personal opinion), we are still at the stage in which the differences among the major LN nodes (clightning, lnd, eclair) are relevant and its difficult to build upon them. 
I'm currently contributing to a LN node wrapper that allows to build node-agnostic application, hopefully enhancing fair competition among them and thus general quality. It currently supports the three mentioned nodes and we're adding support for the (not yet released, but already in github) LN node integrated in electrum. This in my opinion a step forward in lightning development.

Why on earth not mBTC? Currently it's the closest measure unit to our common thinking in euros/dollars. When the relative price will change so will the most comfortable measure unit.
@_date: 2019-10-14 20:03:26
Does anybody know if it's based on an existing node (eclair, c-lightning, lnd) or if they implemented the LN node themselves? I found discordant information about this online.
In case they have a custom node, can anybody show the github page?
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:40:16
I don't agree. Bitcoin would be a small part of his business I assume, and a risk he might want to take on the long run if he expects the price to grow.
Bitcoin will always be volatile if most transactions are for trading and not current use

This is not an answer. We don't even know if in the future the amount of energy required for mining will stabilize or bump up to infinity. The bitcoin community has to think about this. We cannot end up consuming a significant percentage of the global electricity in this phase of energy crisis. There are alternatives to the proof of work, there might be ways to influence or limit its maximum consumptions and there are a lot of ideas yet to be thought about.
Sitting and staring at satoshi's marvel without doing nothing to improve it will not help anybody but probably miners and speculators.

A raspberry pi + a 1tb hdd might cost 100 euros. I don't think storage is the issue. But indeed lack of education  is
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:37:29
You don't need a full node, electrum (light wallet) just integrated LN.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:52:24
We shouldn't forget greta. The bitcoin community should pose itself questions about the energetic and environmental sustainability. And should try to give answers, too.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:06:54
I don't agree. As more transactions need to be published fees go up and so the incentive for miners and the  hash rate and the difficulty and the electric consumption. And from here to when bitcoin will be the most common transaction method the request for new transactions will increase. 
I didn't say that. I just said that we should keep trying to make it better wile remembering energetic sustainability. Not because it's the best known solution it's the best possible.

I know a few shop holders that offer discounts up to 20% to whom pays in bitcoin. That's because they believe in a long term price increase (which looks very logical).
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:57:45
This is bullshit. Power plants can be arranged and new ones built depending on energy needs.
Your reasoning just deresponsabilizes every use of electricity for what pollution is concerned. If nobody would use electricity none would be produced
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:41:32
Every retailer I know that accepts bitcoin (and I know quite a few) solves these issues in the following way:
- accepting zero-confirmation txs. This is not an issue unless you buy a car, and in this case I might as well offer you a cup of tea until a few blocks are mined
- applying a discount on btc payments (usually 10%, but I've also seen 20%) which will in most cases eat the fee cost by far. The seller will make up for this by having more customers and by 'knowing' that the value of bitcoin will increase in the long term
A final and technical solution to these issues is being developed in lightning network, that allows virtually instant and free payments, but still lacks improvements both on the user experience and in reliability. Let LN devs another couple of years and you'll see the revolution.

This is not true until proven.
Go and ask all the mining farms that appeared in Bulgaria (by chance the European country with lowest electricity cost)
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:06:05
And how much did you pay for the computer itself?
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:53:12
Not talking about that, just curious about how much the cpu of a laptop would last.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:44:05
 I contributed to it and I personally know the project owner so feel free to ask any questions, also via pm
I plan to post something about it on r/LightningNetwork as long as I have a bit of spare time.
@_date: 2019-12-10 20:54:09
The mining incentive will be actually taken over by transaction fees, the process already stared and will be gradual.
Not saying the incentive model is perfect, but for now it's working and its technically not difficult to change if necessary
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:46:53
Cool, but it only supports one of the 3 main lightning implementation (lnd) and the other two (at least c-lightning) have their advantages.
If you want to install an implementation independent lightning node (that  also has wip support for electrum LN and will be ready when they release) you can look into [lighter]( a simple lightning node wrapper.  
It communicates internally with the node of your choice and exposes on the outside secure gRPC APIs using TLSv1.2 and macaroon based authentication (roughly the security guarantees of LND).
They also plan to release official support for [raspiblitz]( a similar home node project.

Precisely when they become smaller than 1 sat by halving
@_date: 2019-12-10 20:57:45
Btc is NOT endlessly divisible, the smallest unit (for onchain transactions) is 1sat=10e-8 btc. A hard fork would be required to change this as well as to change mining reward. Although lightning protocol already supports millisatoshis (msat), even if not all implementations do
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:03:25
It's nearly worth r/dataisugly
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:46:05
Exactly, but I don't see the point in continuing to talk about them. It's like inventing the plane and arguing all the time how air balloons are bad, without talking about its own downsides, improvements, strengths.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:42:57
I don't think the main topic around bitcoin is how shitty other currencies are.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:05:14
Nope, I don't agree. You can point out the faults of alternative currencies, but repeating it every day as only and main topic is pointless. Bitcoin has different orders of issues than fiat, and it's better in other ways; let's talk about them!
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:51:55
This sentence is worthless.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:02:49
Exactly. And if I believe in it I'm discussing about how to solve his issues and spread its design ideas, not repeatedly publish fed bank night loan news
