these hearings don't mean shit and never meant shit, price will not be affected
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:17:14
you're stupid as hell
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:36:36
I don't think this is a bull trap though.. maybe we can see 5k\~7k once we reach a new ATH and crash
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:25:54
doubt we will see 5k ever again mate
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:46:37
Hmm maybe, I'm not too sure anymore haha...
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:39:52
Wasn't there a summit supposed to happen today or was it a few days ago?
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:20:14
It did break earlier, just don't panic guys have faith :)
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:29:23
Report his account, I just did.
If enough people report his account he will get auto ban.
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:14:33
I like to draw triangles too.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:51:54
Dropping pretty hard now.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:09:04
WTF happened to that sell wall at 11k? It crumbled!!
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:10:39
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:08:06
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:29:26
So was this a "bear" trap?
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:20:17
Oh shut up mate.
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:59:43
Gone up to 8.1k, could be short lived tho!
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:12:06
It's below 7.6k now :(
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:04:01
Oh wow look at that back at 7850.. you guys need to stop looking at the prices every minute and look at it monthly or even yearly seriously!
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:28:29
Here we come 10.5k!!
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:43:12
+1 to this, usually the alt coins rise heaps more with bit coin, this bounce they haven't gone up by much?!
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:59:13
Not complaining, stating a fact mate. It was neither going up or down. It was pretty cool how it was just stuck on there for awhile.
I guess you are so use to everyone moaning their butts off huh?
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:09:08
Hopefully this just bounces back up...
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:18:54
Are we going back down to 6k?!? Maybe even lower? I hope not!
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:15:12
I'm listening to the sound track of that movie now!!
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:16:13
It's a honey trap, the bears don't know it yet, which is why bitcoin bear market is about to turn bullish.
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:32:18
Seems to be stuck on 8300.00 any barely moving!
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:13:35
How come? He's been screaming SHORT for days now lol
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:46:13
All these green dildos are making me excited...
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:33:12
I totally agree with both your points! Hopefully its the first one! 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:16:32
Not really, more like whale manipulation, look at all the buy orders under 7500, they somehow just increased dramatically for no reason eh..
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:07:57
I saw that too and couldn't believe my eyes, wtf? Surely whale manipulation... 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:16:29
I doubt it!! Steady climb most likely, or decline ha-ha.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:54:55
I haven't seen this guy post in the daily bitcoin thread since it has been going back up, he lurks around the buttcoin thread now with his butt buddies spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:03:12
So how low are we going to go then, back to 7000 before a big spike?
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:18:52
anddd we're back down to 8.5k!
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:06:57
I'm sure by then we'll be able to store bitcoin on a card and we'll be able to tap and tip.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:54:13
And then a red dildo pushing it back down to 8.3k
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:55:34
I'm actually pretty happy with the price fluctuating around 8k to 9k. This shows more sustainability and hopefully growth potential. We haven't had it dip below 7.8k in some time so the longer we hold out the better. My wishful thinking anyway, its better than skyrocketing or dipping way below again right?
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:19:17
Shout out to:
He's been VERY quiet during the rise of BTC again, check out his older comments he kept preaching a crash to 2k-3k and spreading loads of FUD saying 'I told you so'.
"5k here we come. After that 2k."
He now resides in Buttcoin sub reddit, until next time BTC does a price correction I'm sure we'll see him again.
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:51:05
jump up to 9.5k, then crash down 7k, back up to 7.8k, crash down to 6.5k
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:35:41
it hit 11800 over a month ago and then plunged all the way back down to 6800...
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:48:17
ohhh shit here we come 8600
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:22:21
Holy crap!! Down $350 in minutes! That was interesting to watch on GDAX.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:40:26
Good man.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:54:49
Oh yeah wtf? Thats a huge price difference!
