Your comment doesn't make sense... you're arguing against marketing (or at the least advocating) which is one of the hallmarks of any competitive market, and a great technology, business, etc. - should have advocates spreading what's great, honestly there's been a lot less of this on bitcoin than virtually every other coin/altcoin/ICO so not sure what the problem is from your perspective. From mine - a lack of this consistently (and a lack of a process around this - similar to what Dash does) has been one of the trickiest elements to bitcoin that still is the safest, most open crypto currency out there and too much noise and bullshit from people pumping get rich quick schemes. See Verge, see Bitconnect, see literally dozens if not hundreds of others. Sure, they could work, and some I've invested in and wish the best, but many are vaporware with nothing actually in place TODAY, which is very far off from where Bitcoin is.

True true, when you say it cost more - do you mean because you had to pay for the transaction cost for converting btc to fiat? My argument is if Expedia offered a discount (a sweet spot) where they STILL received the cost savings as a merchant - and it helped offset your fees as someone who needed to convert usd to btc - then it would be perfect for all parties.

Actually, I think this is way worse. Since bitcoin is supposed to be digital cash (at least as we're all talking about it),  it's akin to going to an ATM and getting asked the same questions to withdraw one's cash.

Thanks everyone for the interest. And NO I don't spam links :) I try to get out ahead of relevant searches for things with SEO and paid advertising, very simple and very effective. Was working on a recent project for a competitor to coinbase. 
The following I was able to cull after a couple of weeks of testing: 
Around 25% of visitors to the website signup for a wallet (based on a combination of my own numbers for searches/clicks and the reporting coinbase extends). Kudos to coinbase, this is excellent. I might run some extended tests based on the reception here for some additional markets I was able to identify. 
6% purchase a significant amount of bitcoin
I say "significant" because their referral program (at this point) works by recording only $100+ purchases of btc. It's changed a lot over time. This number in particular is a bit lower than I would have expected (and turned me off of the program) - although coinbase really has a number of audiences, so perhaps it's not too low - IE they cater to people looking to purchase btc, they cater to merchants and to people looking for a somewhat secure (and easy) place to store btc.
Based on the numbers they've reported as wallet signups I think it's safe to assume that roughly 90,000 people have purchased a "significant" number of btc from coinbase 1.5 mil * .06 (I'm guessing based on friends and family's use of the service that this is heavily weighted, with a ton of people buying significant btc at the top - and either keeping on CB or transferring off).
My sample size was pretty large for all of this. 
If you have any more questions let me know.

I'm an Internet marketer by trade and ran some tests with their affiliate links - getting people to signup and getting my affiliate code in front of a lot of large searches. I can say with confidence from my sample tests - they convert extremely well - both from searches to accounts/wallets - and then from wallets to purchases. If anyone's interested I can compile my notes and post?

I agree with AnonymousRev's idea of starting a club. For on the ground awareness spreading I think this would be great. Further more your future group could target other groups (I would start in the tech fields and expand outward) helping to educate other students. You could also work on something relating to bitcoin for any class projects as well. 
Personally I am a large btc supporter and stumbled upon a university official at a networking event. From there we convinced my alma matter (I'm all graduated) to receive btc (the first public university in the US) to accept btc via a donation and the university foundation. 
The trick here is that they are typically willing to accept ANYTHING of value - car, jewelry, etc. - and it's a great entry point into the bigger picture of any university. It all depends on how much time and btc you're willing to donate to get things started. Our own plan took about 3 months to execute, which included probably around 10 hours total showing a number of officials (Director of Major Gifts, The University President, Director of the Foundation and Director of Accounting) what Bitcoin is and how to use it. 
Best of luck!

I've thought long and hard about this - have had hundreds of conversations with people. I think it boils down to ignorance. Most people have NO idea how money works, what money is - outside of "customers pay us" and then we "pay vendors" or "I receive a paycheck for work" and "I then use that to buy stuff."
Investing makes sense, but money is something they've never thought about. 
And unlike say religion or politics - at the very least we're (pretty) comfortable being open to hearing about other points of view - or they're simply inescapable. 
When you start to talk to them about Bitcoin - you're asking them to begin to ask large questions - about what money is, how it works in the first place. Then you're asking them to trust that stuff, those dollars or pesos, that are the security, safety for them, their family (IE literally what they survive on) to something new - no matter how much more sound. 
TLDR; people don't know what money is...

Cool to see this naturally come up on the second page of r/bitcoin (yes it's 1:45 and I'm browsing). It was amazing to be a part of this - the first Public University to accept BTC and hope for big things for BTC and we're doing our best to be a part of that.

@_date: 2014-06-11 17:54:56
Awesome news!
Let's do some sample math: 
With $4bil in transactions last year, and the stated 2.95% transactions fees that equates to $120MIL in % fees (not including the per process fees). But, let's assume they get a smaller rate - 1.25%. 
If we estimate the average flight/purchase on the site is $500 (complete guess) - that's 8,000,000 transactions/year. At a cost of $0.10/transactions (much lower than an average merchant of $0.20 - $0.30) that's: 
$800,000 in transactions
Coinbase is free (if they don't cash out) and 1% if they do (max $40mil)... 
This is a tremendous savings for them if more of their transactions switch to bitcoin. 
I wonder if they'll offer some discounts for bitcoin payments as an incentive for people to do so. From a consumer perspective - if merchants/consumers work together to simplify that process I have a feeling things will grow exponentially: 
IE -- if i can buy a plane ticket (as a consumer) for 2% off of a ticket and that's less than coinbases 1% fee to get into bitcoin - and as a merchant I prefer that kind of transaction - why not do so? The only caveat I see here is that it's currently rather slow/complicated to get money INTO bitcoin.

It's not allowed, Google AdWords professional here for 10 years... they shouldn't have gotten through Google's filters (I thought they were automatic at this point). 
Rule is - display URL = landing page URL (actual page they land on) domain - if they don't match it should be shut down immediately (as in the ad won't even allow you to run this so in a way this is already implemented per others' comments. 
Although they could be doing a redirect on site for the original URL/ad and then forcing people to the above redirected URL - but that too is against terms and is flagged immediately. I've seen this with some clients that changed domains or sites, and have never had it be up for more than 24 hours - very strange this hasn't been caught.

I disagree, if I have some disposable income - or simply prefer to pay that way because of security, why shouldn't I ask for them to accept btc. As someone that works with a lot of companies and non-profits I know it would help convince more of the benefits you mention above if more people were asking said organizations to pay (or donate) in btc. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:30:52
Maybe I'm completely wrong, but there seems to be those that are comfortable with tech and not - that both love and hate bitcoin - and those that aren't comfortable with tech, that hate bitcoin and can't be bothered - or are somewhat excited/interested. 
To me the common thread seems to be - the tech stuff is just noise, but the anger (even from those that ARE tech savvy - albeit haven't dug into how bitcoin works) that are vehemently opposed to it. And although on occasion it seems some of them think that messing with the current banking/finance infrastructure is futile, or - on the whole - they think money = magic, or dollars = value because it just does, because that's the way it is, and "what makes bitcoin worth anything". 
Most people are REALLY uncomfortable learning about this stuff. They've worked there lives for paper or units in an account which they have NO idea how it works, but they know it works (or kind of works). 
Lots of people have this giant firewall up when it comes to money. I think they want to hold on to whatever it is they believe (or ignore or remain ignorant of how it works). 
No one has ever asked how a conventional ATM works, or how their bank works, but they're quick to attack what they see as problems in bitcoin no matter how far down the tech you go. I didn't understand this until I started looking at things differently. 
As for your points - 
Bitcoin == complex... Bitcoin isn't complex, certainly not when compared to current banking infrastructure and transfers. I've read books and books on the history of money, on dollars, the federal reserve, fractional reserve (the papers put out by the fed)... learning about bitcoin was far easier - with the exception of the actual programming. 
No recourse for mistakes in some ways is the point, and is at the core of the problem BTC solves - with products and services emerging to address this for the average consumer this is a non-issue. It's like Bitcoin is extracting out and getting right (for the technology age) all of the conventional banking services.  
On consumer protections I see where you're coming from, but as I grow older I see this as a double edged sword, and at the same time feel the above (recourse/services) will solve many of these problems. There's already insurance in place on many services, and this will only continue to get better.

@_date: 2014-09-06 04:02:41
Agreed. What I find interesting though is "what's different?" And it seems that the tech became much more personal, much more immediate. From letters (where you had to go to a mailbox or purchase stamps) to email, to billing, to the phone booth example - everything's on one's person and immediate. Not to join the circlejerk, but bitcoin makes sense here. Bringing a bank to my phone. 
What else though? 
Products in general, right now i have to go out and buy stuff. Soon I can download and print them via a 3d printer?
Jobs? 
Everyone's a hotel via Airbnb, everyone's a merchant via OpenBazaar, everyone can work remotely...

Honestly, of all of the banks I've used or had over the years I LOVE Suncoast, but their website JUST went down. Their ENTIRE system that monitors transactions, allows people to open accounts, transfer money, etc. went down last week as well for about an hour. (They're going through a rebranding).

What is the point of this post? 
I've been around longer, and not sure I agree with the overall sentiment and your analysis of it. 
I think as this thing continues to grow a very detailed, nuanced approach to changes/enhancements to bitcoin is important - we have a lot at stake now. Have you read Vinny Lingham's blog posts in their entirety? From a hodler's perspective, I thought the ETF would be great (although I knew that big institutional money probably wouldn't be a good thing) after reading his work I was thoroughly convinced that the ETF was indeed bad for BTC and genuinely happy it didn't go through - even though that meant a (very temporary) dip in BTC price. 
On the volatility - it has come way down. I'm confused by this point in your OP. 
Finally, I have to agree with Vinny's breakdown of the way in which Bitcoin will grow and become (finally) adopted as a currency. What you have to understand is that the world is now looking at BTC as a disconnected store of value (think Gold/Silve - but BTC currently less manipulated) and that there are virtually no assets/currencies not pegged to U.S. interest rates. There's not just more at stake from a value position for all involved (HODLERs, miners, companies, etc.) but there are much larger market mechanics (and mischief) than your average r/bitcoiner is probably thinking of. I for one think a very slow and steady approach is the way to go. And if I can hold much of my financial networth (in theory) on a complete secure and protected device that bank runs can not touch - it's worth a higher transaction fee (for now - and this will be worked out). 
Without knowing much of the economics of mining (now) I have to think that we could all DO NOTHING, and see bitcoin triple/quadruple in a year because of larger macro economic trends across all countries (stemming in large part from changes to U.S. interest rates) - and I'd have to imagine the miners will be profiting from the increase in pricing/coin as well as the higher transaction fees. I think it's dangerous to jump to any conclusions, and it's just a feeling, but the BU stuff sounds manufactured and for short term gain.

Yes, there have been videos exposing how they go about creating their own under cover videos - paying people to say/do things they otherwise wouldn't do or mis-characterizing the scenario they intentionally put people in to fit the narrative they're creating/pushing.

Appreciate you elevating the discourse. Any suggestions for the future. Agree with you on the freedom side. As you reach the highest peaks you can see, it allows you to see even higher peaks that one thinks is impeding their ability to be free. The more you know the more you realize you don't know. 
On the profit side I think it's a matter of morals and use. As a business owner we had many years of success and profits. All saved at the company. In the last recession and during hard times this allowed us to weather the storm and keep people employed, smoothing an otherwise jagged a d dangerous business cycle. But then again it's a tiny tiny business.

Don't do a lot of trading on there, but I love it. Stopped using coinbase and switched to them some time ago. Love the interface (it's more of a trading site than a broker/wallet like coinbase) but you can still buy. Plus, the buys are instant (they just put a hold on the coins you purchase with the ACH debit you do or wire transfer you initialize). 
If you're not an active trader, I find the auction to be the best place to pick up coins at a good price quickly (closes every day at 4pm).

Exactly... if they want them, they need to get in the real (public) market.

No where in the main comment I'm referencing do you reference 68 years nor your country. Perhaps it's in a conversation you're having with someone else that this is referenced. Calling me a moron, particularly after my last reply, only serves to lower you - you do realize this right? Not sure why you're so upset with/at me.

I think it comes down to other skills - speaking, people, ability to relay an idea, etc. Not as much to do with any kind of schooling/education. I went to school for art, but am a pretty good orator and translator, that's turned into sales and other ventures. Legal education and the act of being a lawyer is also much different. Most lawyers are personally responsible (at least in part) for attracting and retaining (marketing &amp; sales) their clients - so same thing applies. Agree though in the dichotomy - seems people respect lawyers/accountants more than devs for some ridiculous reason.

Actually the CIA, it was recently disclosed, has its own internal NSA. Huge cyber "security" force. They were hacked along with their tools. 
The powers that be are going to attack btc unless they own enough. False flags could easily paint btc in a poor light, and provide grounds to shut it down. The more decentralized we can make btc the better imo. And the CIA seems to have a consistent track record of fucking with shit as opposed to the NSA.

Thanks for the great questions. 
1. We intend (for now) to keep all proceeds from clients, vendors, etc. that pay in BTC - in BTC. 
2. Employees will continue to be paid in USD. We did show everyone at the company how to use BTC and provided a small funding sum for everyone's wallets.
3. Taxes - we'll have to talk with our accountant on this. For the original BTC we hold - I expect long-term capital gains will apply as we don't plan on selling. For any taxable events - we'll be paying taxes (payment received or payments made in BTC). 
4. No converting. The real value we see is that it's an educational experience for our partners and those connected with the firm and will (most likely) save us some modest processing fees. Right now a number of transactions are paid via credit cards - to the tune of thousands/year - we hope this saves us that $ - and through education - we can hopefully save our clients/vendors/partners thousands per year as well. 
EDITED - Employees will continue to be paid in USD.... originally wrote BTC... whoops :)... perhaps one day.
