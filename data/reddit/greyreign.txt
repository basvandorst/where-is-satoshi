Coinbase will probably implement their Wrongthink Detection Layer and stop transactions on the spot if they find out you don't care if the Secretary of State didn't eat a vegan lunch now.

The guy calls you out for being a media parrot, and you refute what he says by being a media parrot. Mueller is being allowed to stay and conclude his investigation, because they know nothing will come of the hoax. He could have been fired a long time ago, but on top of the media being caught lying by Veritas on video admitting it's "bullshit" and "a nothingburger" they're letting it conclude so you McCarthyists can finally have some peace of mind that Vladimir Putin isn't hiding in your closet at night. If there were anything on him, they would have had something by now. You're going to be very disappointed.

It's like a fucking talking points memo from the hags on The View that are regurgitated over and over despite how false it all is, then parroted. We're reaching Orwellian levels.

Exactly right. Big dips have happened 3 times since August and it's always recovered well. I love these dips, I fully expect the corrections, and buying and hodling more at half price, has been great lately. I wish people had the patience to wait this stuff out. They really need to wait and see how well LN will smooth out everything too. The tech that's emerging is great. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:47:01
Haven't you people heard "THE BUBBLE HAS BURST! WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET IRRADIATED! THE CRASH IS FINALLY HAPPENING" -cnbc, Bloomberg, Roger Ver, Forbes. probably. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:55:15
Nice writeup. Amidst all the memes and price talk, it's great to see something on the emerging technology. I'd love to see it go anonymous and finally implement the LN.

He bombed the shit out of them. They've vacated Syria and Iraq.

When I read the news in the morning it's always "x person says Bitcoin will hit 25,000 this year!" if it's stabilizing or going up slightly. But they're salivating at the chance to drown people in FUD when they can. It usually **IS** Bloomberg, and sometimes CNBC. I'm sure there's a mountain of anecdotal evidence beyond that.

The economy looks to be real fuckin good right now after Obama put us $9 trillion deeper in debt over 8 years. Remember quantitive easing? And its sequel? The Fed loved the past 8 years. Trump isn't a fan. That's good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:57:37
It seems bullshit makes the world go around because of this. Journalistic integrity? Fact checking? Why bother? Just let the cattle keep clicking and we'll keep them "informed" as they're too busy to do anything with crucial information other than process hot takes. The media is adjusting their price model to our shortened attention spans.

And here's a nytimes report explaining why you're a fucking brainless sack of shit, your graph is nothing, and run on whiney-bitch libtard tantrums than logic:

They wrote that article when BTC was at $3,366. It feels like ancient history, but that was only 9 days ago, which adds more amusement to the whole situation.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:34:54
The fed and $20 trillion in debt sound familiar? He pulled out of TPP, record setting stocks (damn, that sounds like bitcoin), and has reduced the trade and financial deficit that's accumulated over the past 25 years. You're welcome to more bailouts and quantitative easing, but just realize you're an idiot if you actually support all that.

I honestly don't know how this video is allowed anywhere. That is the sickest shit I've ever watched, and I've seen a few times. I don't even know how I sat through it. I hope you went to the hospital asap and didn't get an infection. I need to go puke now. Wow. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:47:05
I also reported it all. Make sure to use the words "felon" and "scam artist" when describing Roger Ver, because they're absolutely true.

Didn't want any shitcoins. Only wanted to hold btc. Took me awhile to get motivated to sell off the BCH, but now it's done. The sky isn't falling, we'll...  maybe for them soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:32:26
It already is! I sold Ver's BCH shitcoin that I had laying around for BTC today during this insignificant dip. When BTC hits $8,000 soon, the moron will have made me $22,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:39:14
Best of luck

Considering it's a show that appeals to people that think "EVIL CAPITALISM WILL RUIN US ALL!", who don't view the fed or central banks quite as harshly as the rest of us, it'll probably shit all over bitcoin. The show made by shills as it is.
That said, I miss the earlier seasons. They used to be hilarious.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:38:05
Exactly. When things like this happen, I'm actually happy about it. I'm not happy others are getting duped by assholes, but, I love every dip that occurs because I know it will level out eventually. I buy every one knowing the technology and the wider adaptation of it will continue to make it unstoppable. What doesn't kill BTC makes it, and people's knowledge of it, stronger.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:34:32
This is fantastic. Can't wait to use it. Thanks Peter and everyone else. It's nice to have people who know what the hell they're doing. I'm looking forward to all the improvements you guys roll out.

Insignificant because everyone and their uncle knows idiots with weak hands are panicking, while the rest of us just buy low and hodl, and it proves to be the right course of action, over and over again.

A domestic terrorist group that's been rooted in anti-capitalism and suppresses other people's free speech with violence, needs bitcoin donations now. lmao.

Agreed. Still though, these weak-handed panic sellers shouldn't even bother anymore. It's like every tiny piece of news or bs from some asshole ceo is treated like gospel. They say 90% of people fail at this. I really wonder if that number is higher. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:41:36
Why do you not care about panic sellers? Is it because you want volatility high?

I didn't avoid anything. It's complete bullshit that's been debunked by Assange himself. They're not in bed with anyone.  Other than the fabricated outrage cited, we've been waiting for evidence over a year now on anything else. 


It doesn't matter one way or another when he decided. It doesn't matter what your feelings are on the subject either. Wikileaks has evidence of the contrary. They have it corroborated. Those are facts. Stop appealing to emotion and hearsay. The clown show is getting old.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:02:14
So you're saying all the emails they exposed from Podesta, HRC, Huma, etc... that date back as far as 2015, before Trump announced his run, and that have been shown to corroborate what's on Weiner's laptop, on the IG's multiple reports, and the House Intel Committee's investigations, are false?  Nice mental gymnastics.
Is this because your feelings are hurt that your hoax isn't going the way you want it to, or do you have evidence of Wikileaks ever being incorrect? Because there are many websites that look into them, and they can't find fault. They've been legit. They're right about Coinbase as well.
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:39:01
For some reason I had a mental picture of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's "Negan" from The Walking Dead when I read that.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:59:07
Yeah, patronize someone over the internet who's got a damn good portfolio, whom you know nothing about, because of some juvenile political hysteria you and other halfwits buy into. I'm almost willing to bet, seeing your lack of intelligence or insight, that I'm probably older "son". We call this lunacy "projection" in your case.
EVERYTHING I mentioned has to do with what Trump is doing atm. Jobs, record economical gains, exponential job growth never seen in 28+ years, lowering unemployment rates, etc... are exactly the result of his policies. 
The fun part: I don't care what some random peon on reddit proclaims. You are miserable, uninformed, little shits that have him living in your heads rent-free, and it's beyond hilarious. Your line of thinking is going extinct, and nothing you do can stop him, or the people that don't have their heads up their asses, by watching MSNBC all day. Ciao.

Yeah he's so irrational unemployment is at a 16 year low, jobs are skyrocketing, he's anti-esablishment/outsider and always has been, "big government" (GOP and Dems) hate HIM. Trade deficits are being erased and reversed. Countries respect his business acumen unlike the former guy. Deals are fair now. Prices of goods are coming down. Stock market breaks records weekly. He's exactly what bitcoin needs.

Pay attention to what's going on and not the constantly debunked bullshit you watch on the evening news or read on reddit. I'm not going to hold your hand over the simplest thing if you're this oblivious. Even though the media hates the guy, at least some of these basic details are being shown to the lemmings that tune in.
