Well the money goes to someone, it's not like it just disappears off the face of the earth.
Also if he's betting this amount I'm sure he has more money.. You don't bet this amount if it's all you have to your name

The story is they grabbed him while he was logged in to everything, so his computer had everything open.
But I really doubt he would just have everything sitting there on one wallet, that used a password that was saved in plaintext somewhere on his computer.

I am assuming you never looked at the bitcoin price before?
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:47:41
Easiest way?
Give the other person your bitcoin address and they send you bitcoins.
If they plan on using coinbase to get the coins, and you also use coinbase, just send a $500 payment request to their email on coinbase.

Don't think anyone really says to use them as  a wallet. Same as coinbase. You use them to buy your coins then you move out to your own secured wallets.
