You're missing the point here: Bitcoin isn't at fault anymore, hasn't been for a long time. Half of this thread is people with cursory information blaming Bitcoin for something it really didn't do, pretty much par for the course I guess. Every thread has some people complaining about how Bitcoin hasn't died yet because it would make GPUs so much cheaper.
Not that Crypto will ever die, at most it will be replaced with something even better, but man those salty princesses sure like to complain about shit they don't even remotely understand.

You're the dude who claims there are "many financial systems [...] faster, cheaper, more secure" when you clearly didn't think it over in the context of his hypothetical. What's it going to be now?
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:08:43


Judging from last year, you meant to say "shoots up".
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:31:58


Oh, ok, because it sure doesn't seem that way.

That's like going to and tagging every story with that subreddit link. Technically not wrong, but who the hell is so oblivious to even point it out?

Well, you are pretty apologetic about the shortcomings of what I assume is your favorite project in the space, but convincing people really doesn't work without showing them how it's done. Just tell them what they should do so the fees won't surpass 2 bucks and clear in ten minutes or so.

Are you saying bitcoin is the pinnacle of decentralization? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:53:14
Right, but assuming that there is a definite possibility of bitcoin having had its peak is not him being mistaken. That's healthy scepticism at the very least. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:58:22
Check who he died to.

That describes about any crypto trading sub here, tools and shills as far as the eye can see.

"You don't know something. Hence it would be better for you not to meddle with it."
What kinda logic is that? Do you think people magically get a trojan by accessing deep web pages? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:13:07
Right, people shouldn't download anything or access any pages at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:38:58
Would have almost worked, [except yuan is pronounced \[ɥæn\]]( and not like Juan or anything remotely sounding like that.


Is pretty good though, gotta say.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:53:44
There are clear performance metrics you could look for though. Future prospect? That's ambiguous, always. De facto performance however, that's something we can (and do) measure.

Oh man, I can't wait for Terry to read blogs about the "CIA niggers" and their modern world sacrileges. This guy is always surprisingly entertaining.

How about ETH? Could you debunk its viability in comparison to BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:56:39
How do we even know what constitutes "organic" for a technology we've never even seen?
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:02:33
You sold the one crypto worth holding right now.
Seriously though, check out the sub and you will find that ETH is so much more than just some "alt"coin.

Link? 
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:09:10
No, it's not. Neither voice synth nor video, not if you want viewers not to see extremely obvious seams. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:07:08
We're talking about footage that requires days to clean up perfectly. This is still more than unlikely and anyone who has industry experience will tell you the same. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:03:08
Artifacts, like a whole shitton of them. It's great for cleaning up stuff, but it doesn't solve this problem. At all. 
Check out wavenet and similar "timbre transfer" solutions, that's the tech that will make this possible in the very near future. Doesn't change the fact that synthesizing speech takes a ridiculous amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:04:45
People keep ignoring that Assange was talking what, like 60 minutes? Nobody can do even half a minute flawlessly and for now there will be very obvious artifacts. Not to mention that real-time speech synthesis is even more problematic than the video, so... 
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:22:48
What are you even talking about? What non-intrusive ad can you think of the top of your head that would "steal your money"? What do you think intrusive means?
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:20:56


yes actually, yes it is. it's own by Roger, the guy pushing bcash. You must be new. ;)


It's not
What's it going to be now? Make up your mind if you're running around accusing people of "being bias".

Googling websites is extra redundancy, if you're not sure, googling should allow you to figure out which is legit and which isn't.
Yeah, using a bookmark might be the safest option, but what if it was changed, was wrong to begin with or some other shenanigans? Googling a site will autocorrect misspelled words and - unless you don't have an adblocker or Metamask installed - never send you down an uncertain, malicious road. If you really don't: "What the hell are you doing and why aren't you reading your basic information brochures? This shit's important." is the mantra to go by here.
Googling is good. People make mistakes, even with things they've done countless times. Be it drugs or just sleepiness, we're bad at this. Googling mitigates common errors, so I'll take that in a world where no adblockers exist.

The wear is negligible compared to normal gamer usage. Exclusively using it for mining will see users undervolting their cards anyways and reduce the overall thermal stress, seeing as you have constant performance and aren't "revving" the card.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:12:57


If by Bitcoin you mean just cryptos in general and by "all in" you mean "making a small bet", then yes, I assume you'd be almost correct with your subtle headline.
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:52:21
Which, arguably, would make a man in his position "dumb", wouldn't it? It's not exactly a precise term, but this amount of ignorance has to be expressed somehow.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:00:50
Who told you that? This is completely unreasonable due to the sheer numbers alone and not in the least true. You can be compelled to delete inappropriate comments, doesn't mean every section is going to be closed due to fear of hate speech or something.
They just wrote a shitty article and people complained about it, so they decided to just shut it down. Happens all the time, everywhere.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:56:57
Actually, people are mostly calling tagesschau out for having written an unbearably badly researched article.
