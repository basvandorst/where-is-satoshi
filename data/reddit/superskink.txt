This is an article by a very libertarian minded man with little to no education in real economics. He attack Krugman's valid economic question, valid but maybe not good, by using political ideas. He never answers Krugman's question, merely attacks the man and shifts the argument. There is no reason in economics to divorce money from the government. "Keynesian" economics, or the vast majority of economics to anyone in the field, is not a negative thing but simply the most common system. It has incorporated most positive points of other economic philosophies. This is not a good article, simply just another rabid anti-gov blogger trying to put his political thoughts against economic analysis. For bitcoin to ever be taken as real currency the tough economic questions need to be answered.
Edit: Horrible spelling errors I didn't catch earlier.

Bonds are sold to more than just banks. Banks hold a significant amount of bonds in their assets, they don't just liquidate them all. Income tax is used to pay for a ton of shit other than the debts on interest. Banks don't lend out all their money and this has caused a ton of additional problems. Anything else? Plus the person that made it has absolutely no credentials.

The misinformation in that video is worse than many Fox News segments, I hope you actually listen to someone that knows what they are talking about.

Wait, you think that they control the inflation rate? You think they have that much control over the monetary system? I think they would love to hear that because that means they have a lot more tools then they believe now. They have a target, that they think is preferred but they have little control over the true amount in circulation vs stored in reserves or under mattresses. I am sorry that you are sad that you can't have $1000 in a mattress and have it be worth the exact same in 100 years but there are many investments that can do pretty much the same thing for you. I suggest you read more or take classes about how the fed really works atm or the tools it currently has.

Well if the end of 2013 is any judge then I think itll be okay.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:07:26
Really? Have you ever talked to anyone that is from the Fed? Have you ever taken classes on how it works? Or are you simply listening to crazy hacks that think the government is trying to hurt them? I implore you to actually get educated on the matter and actually talk to the people you are claiming are doing these things.

Um I'm sorry. I didn't know this was r/conservative. The larger point of my comment is that he never answers the question at all.

Well the treasury prints money, so that clears that up. Second the Fed controls only 1 real tool currently and they have a target inflation rate and they have been under that for the last few years. Modern economics supports the free market. I am confused on where you were educated on economics, because they did a poor job. The great depression was created by many things but not tariffs. On the other hand, Austrianism has never been tested because the costs are too high. I don't understand your confusion, misinformation or paranoia about the Fed and economics.

I don't think sympathize is the right word, understand or comprehend is better. I don't think the author really understands the Fed or what it actually does. I was lucky enough to talk to the president of the San Fran Fed and he is an incredibly down to earth guy that talked about economics and the Fed in simple terms. They are normal people with families like everyone else. They are simply economists doing their best to maintain a stable economy. Besides they aren't part of the USFG, why would they get kickbacks and such?

This article is a great example of people with absolutely no understanding of how the Fed works and the extremely limited tools they have. This is another chance to dodge the question that Economists have about bitcoin by screaming about the "establishment" or "the man". The Fed  can't and won't "inflate the USD". They aren't in a conspiracy to rob people of their money or anything else. I wish this hog wash would disappear because every article like this in more discrediting to Bitcoin and the people that support it by the minute.

A gold and silver historian... okay. Where is his PhD from? What did he do his research on? Why in the world should I listen to this garbage?
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:02:26
So what else do we do? If they didn't do these things what would have happened to the international economy? Yeah they had to do shitty things to stop the downturn. But honestly I choose a fragile recovery over a huge depression.
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:08:17
Exactly! I am really intrigued by when they are actually going to start answering these questions. Every time they do this dance it decreases Bitcoin's credibility with economists. I think that they should focus more on answering the questions and less on attacking the man that asks them, a Nobel prize winning economist in this case.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:22:04
I would like one too. Mostly it just is one of the conditions economic models function under.

I disagree with your worries about inflation. Inflation is something that happens with monetary systems like the dollar and something the Fed works hard to control. We have had under 2% inflation for a considerable amount of time and honestly inflation hasn't caused any recent problems. This might be just a terminal disagreement but I think that if you read the article knowing the assumptions he comes in with, including about inflation, then you are better served. And again not everyone interested in bitcoin is libertarian.

I would not disagree with you about the problems of big banks. I would say that those problems are separate from the Fed or the Central Banking system. Plus in the end the system as you or I both know is not that complex or convoluted. Definitely not as complex as some of the computer knowledge that is needed for total understanding of Bitcoin.

Why is being skeptical bad? I am an economics student that is interested in learning about bitcoin because it is new and fun to learn about but it isn't what most economists are used to talking about. It is relatively new and untested and I think what you are seeing is that people are skeptical about it because it has some worrisome behaviors. I looked at many of the responses to comments and it seems just as, if not more, hostile to anyone in the camp than anyone is to the Bitcoin people. It might be a great train we miss because we didn't just hop on, but hey that happens when you are risk adverse. Give it 10-20 years, get real robust data sets and stabilization and people will be talking big time about it. Also, before you all start yelling about inflation fetishes and start demonizing traditional economics, realize it is the exact same as what you are disliking in the current world.
