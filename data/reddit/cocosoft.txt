Your coins will show up when bitcoin core is done synchronizing (this will take a while).
In the meantime, you could try looking up your address in a blockchainviewer such as [Blockr]( or [Blockchain.info](

This.  
Because bumping it to stay at 20MB is just pushing the problem into the future.
We need to have some kind of gradual movement, because otherwise we'll NEVER be able to change from 20MB to X.

a) We develop working quantum computers  
b)SHA256 is cracked
Which is why we should make it a habit to be able to do hard forks on the network (somehow...), because then we could possibly move to quantum safe algorithms if SHA256 ever became obsolete.

The chain is compatible with the other "client" up to a certain point (block), where they fork off in two different chains. I wouldn't call one of them an alt coin, a chain fork is a better way to describe the situation.
And to clarify, I would call both chains Bitcoin.

I agree what you're saying, my only objection would be that people who have ADSL broadband will be limited to the physical and technological limits there are, and won't see any increase in speed (no higher than 24Mb edit: and around 3Mb upstream).

@_date: 2015-06-20 20:32:21
Yes, that's kind of what I'm implying. Some places just don't have cable or fiber broadband, including where I live. A change there will take a time...
The other "option" is 4G but that won't work anyways because of the broadband data limit most contracts have.
I just want to point out that I'm still all for a block size increase (I actually want no block size limit at all, just as before the quick fix was added in the first place). I don't believe this is a big issue.

If miners are stupid and short mined, they would want 1KB blocks.  
But almost everyone (including miners) want bitcoin to succeed in the long run (as a system that "everyone" can be a part of).
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:56:28
It can be considered a hard fork because old clients (back then) that would hypothetically mine a &gt;1MB block would be forked away.

LN/StrawPay are good technologies, but there's nothing that "forces" them to become widely adopted - I bet they will, but there's no "push".
When the 0.8 hardfork happened, it was a completely game breaking bug. Which is why reddit/facebook/twitter and every other social network got spammed of the current happening.  
It will proabably be the same with the upcoming 20MB fork (if it happens), but not so much about LN.

But if you and countless others would have come down and agreed on a solution YEARS ago, the Bitcoin XT idea wouldn't even had materialized, but for years the issue had been ignored and now we're dangerously near the block size limit. Don't sound like you didn't knew that this situation would occur.


I think he fully understands Lightning Network, it's just that you're so narrow-minded about the situation that you can't see that even though LN the proper solution, it's unreasonable to suggest that the whole infrastructure will move to lightning immediately, it will take time, probably years. Using the bitcoin blockchain is the way we're doing transactions with bitcoin today and it is the social contract we "signed on" - if the block size limit isn't raised before we hit the current 1MB limit, we *will* see chaos, and the first and best alt-coin that understands this will gain traction, for good or bad.

Just because it doesn't scale to 7 billion people today, doesn't mean it won't do it tomorrow - You're greatly underrating Moore's Law.
The very same scaling discussion was made in Satoshi's first post in the metzdowd.com's public mailing list, this was back in 2008. You may will be able to run a fullnode on your laptop *but that's okay*, people need to accept this trade-off.
Satoshi's intent of Bitcoin was *not* to limit it to 1MB blocks.

Yes, but OpenBazaar supports escrows and other things that isn't really needed of a decentralized torrent application. It is tailor-made for goods trading.

Well actually yes, otherwise we lose one of the core features of bitcoin. Even Coinbase acknowledged this and made 2sig vault.
In the long run there will be big companies that run on bitcoin, but right now changetip is not a *really* good way to promote bitcoin, it's a good way to promote applications that run on bitcoin.

Let me put it in this way, the thing that will make people start using bitcoin is to buy things, both online and in store.
But if people like you insist of purchasing anything with your bitcoins despite that you can easily buyback, stores and companies will look at bitcoin and see that market adoption isn't high enough and just discard bitcoin, how will anyone then want to get into bitcoin if there's no store that accept it? Therefore the demand of bitcoin will be less than the supply and the price will go down.
It is **we**, the early adopters that need to support any company or store  that accepts bitcoin in any way. Because otherwise bitcoin will just fail and not grow anymore. 
But I think you look at bitcoin as just an investment, its actually more than that, right now it's an investment but it's also a viable currency because the speed and trustless nature of the platform to name a few.

When the user sends the funds from the wallet, the transaction directly gets relayed through the network. This happens fast, and Bitpays sniffs up the transaction just in a matter of seconds. Bitpay then register it as brought.
After ~10 minutes, the transaction gets added on top the public ledger (blockchain) by one miner, and the transaction is officially confirmed for the first time. One purpose of the blockchain is to make sure there's no double spending happening.
How Bitpay works is that it acts as a spectator node of the network, and look for double spending attempts itself. This is why we don't need to work 10 minutes for it to be confirmed. You could say that it acts a centralized actor that we need to trust (in contrast to the blockchain).
After the transaction has been confirmed into the blockchain, bitpay doesn't need to look for double spending any more. But for the first 10-60 minutes, it needs to.

Because there is a **huge conflict of interest**.  
2/5 of the core developers are working on a for profit company. This could greatly stifle bitcoin development (as already seen when the 2 developers working for Blockstream vote Nay to increase the OP_RETURN size).
A following problem (maybe unlikely but possible) is that a sidechain becomes bigger than the mainchain itself. Maybe that chain is made by a for profit company, which could exclusively steer the developments.

You really don't need to state obvious things like 1 btc is an arbitrary amount. Having 1 btc was a milestone for me, and is for many other people.

There's nothing saying that 20%+ of the other 80% wont upgrade. Especially if the message says "URGENT, UPDATE NEEDED. WILL BREAK CLIENT OTHERWISE".
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:25:49


Of course, I know that. I'm not sure how it looks anywhere else but it isn't visible anywhere for us swedes. There's no log of "credit cards transaction costs".


I've tried the Wikileaks bitcoin vs Paypal argument, and it is of no interest, but then again, why would it be? The average person doesn't run his own Wikileaks, and as much as I care that it is important to have the Government separated from money, the average person probably doesn't.
And for person to person transactions, in Sweden we actually have a service called Swish that lets you send money (SEK) though your smartphone to another persons bank account. It's instant (in between swedish banks) and actually completely free at the moment and will start to cost around 1 SEK (0.14$) next year, that's even competitive to bitcoin(!).
It seems really hard to convince people over here because we already have it pretty fair. We really seem to love our currency and we voted down to Euro.  
I cannot think of a killer argument really and it's pretty frustrating.
I feel like the adoption of Bitcoin in US, UK and Germany will be important for the adoption in Sweden.

It won't help. You won't be able to spend pennies (without paying a transaction fee) on the blockchain, because the miners need a reward.
You can't just pretend that sidechains will solve all problems.
This is just how it is and I'm having no problem with that. Bitcoin and blockchain solved the double spending problem by proof of work. This is not going to magically disappear.

Time will tell, at worst waiting for 1 confirmation should be enough (~10 min). But as I wrote, BitPay already protects against doublespending so there's nothing really to worry about.
But manually checking each bitcoin transaction that SHIPITO seems to do is just pure madness, some kind of automatic process should be done, if they're that paranoid.

I understand now that it's more bound to the Internet than I originally thought...
Yes it's pretty bound to the internet. Worth noting is that it's bound to the internet because it's the most feasible network. One could broadcast transactions via satellite for example.
For a integallactic bitcoin system we would probably need some other kind of network.


I would say probably tens of thousands miners.  
Miners are joining different "mining pools" such as BTC guild and P2Pool where they collaboratively mine together and share the bitcoin reward. The reason for joining pools is that it's easier to solve the computational problem (mentioned in the other post) together than solve it alone.
Miners probably exchange most of their bitcoins for USD/EUR, but I don't know, perhaps someone else with knowledge could fill in?

If you think volatility is a problem, maybe you should look into services such as [Coinapult]( and [BitReserve]( which provides safety by letting you store fiat/dollar and exchange the corresponding value when you need it.
It also depends on why you think volatility is a problem, in the long term we all believe that the price will settle, I don't think anyone would have faith in bitcoin otherwise. Bitcoin volatility is a problem *now* and not in the future.  
With that being said, my strategy is buying some bitcoin every month. I also try to spend it whenever I can, but I'm **not** spending the amount I'm hodling, instead I'm buying the right amount of bitcoin I need to buy the product I want.
For that reason I'm not afraid of volatility because I know that in the long term that my bitcoins will need to be worth more as the block reward decreases and wide adoption continues. In the other case bitcoin might fail, in that case I'm not that concerned, because *I haven't invested more than I can afford to*.
If you're in for bitcoin in the short term, maybe you shouldn't be in at all.

Bitcoin is made up of a network, every wallet and also miners are essentially a part of the network.
Miners are rewarded bitcoin for securing the network. They are securing the network by checking transactions for fraud and double spending.
There are no "mines", rather the miners get rewarded in newly created bitcoins by the network for their work of securing the network. They get rewarded in newly generated bitcoins. It works because every wallet (and other miners really) are agreeing on this. It relies on the common consensus of the network.
One miner is rewarded once in about every ten minutes. Only one miner is rewarded, that is because all miners are in a race of solving a computational problem that should on average take 10 minutes. The first miner solving the problem is the one who get the bitcoin reward.


The protocol says there should only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation. When we hit that limit every part of the network (every wallet and miner) would need to agree to add new bitcoins to the network. I believe this would not be possible because bitcoin owners would not agree on creating new bitcoins because inflation basically lower the value of bitcoins.
We can check how many bitcoins there are in circulation because bitcoin have an open ledger (the blockchain) that keeps all the transactions and also all newly created coins, we can check all the newly created coins rewarded to the miners, it adds up to about 13 million bitcoins as of today.
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:45:29
Probably because orphans happening could invalidate the newly mined bitcoins.
Satoshi probably calculated that after *at least* 120 blocks, hypothetical orphans would be solved to one main chain, and losing bitcoins because of losing oprhan chain would be impossible.

Offline transactions aka "Share internet connection of the receiver/PoS system". I know that the Android Bitcoin app has implemented "offline transactions" by letting the receiver share a bluetooth internet connection to the sender.
It works by applying  &amp;bt=&lt;Mac of the bluetooth device&gt; to the QR code generated (or providing the same query string on a NFC connection).
Is this using any BIP standard at all? Is it defined somewhere how this all should work? I guess it would be easier for PoS system prodivers to implement such solutions if a common standard for this was developed.

If we want a decentralized network, then we need those numbers, but we can abstract this away (with QR codes, email and NFC as examples).

I think the group that created IPv4 for some reason didn't have scalability in mind as much as we would hope for, Bitcoin did, though.
There are 4 294 967 296 (2^32 ) IPv4-addresses.
To put that in perspective, there are 2^160 bitcoin addresses, and I don't even want to write out that ridiculously big number. I recommend you to search on google and find some stack overflow threads about this topic, if you feel uncomfortable that there aren't enough addresses.

I think we're looking at it in the wrong way.  
Will the government have the ability to pressure a bitcoin 'paypal', in the essence of blocking donations to Wikileaks? 
 
The answer will be yes for every company trying to sell bitcoin payment processing systems, because it will be acting as an central authority. We need an open source initiative that lets the user host it's own payment processor kind of like how Joomla and wordpress works for sites/blogs.
^(yes of course they Wikileaks could just list a single simple bitcoin address on their page...)

Yes, this is probably true. My comment was mostly towards the Straight open source project and not necessarily StraightAsia, which the thread is really about.


What I'm saying is that in the *long term*, we shouldn't need to convert BTC -&gt; HKD, which is why open source payment procesors are so important. We shouldn't *necessarily* need BitPay in the long run, and BitPay themselves are well aware of this.
But yes StraightAsia is probably only for generating money, but I'm actually fine with that.

The problem is if a side chain becomes more popular then the main chain. Then blockstream only need to satisfy their interest.

Why? Just for helping the network! A peer to peer network is no good with only a few nodes.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:45:11
No, the transaction is broadcasted instantly throughout the network, but it gets confirmed by the miners in about 10 minutes (basically that means that a double-spending cannot happen after that).  
Normally you don't really need to wait for the confirmation, mainly because payment processors like BitPay already checks for double-spending, and also takes the risk. 
But if you send like $1 000,000,00, then maybe you would want to wait until 6 confirmations (~1h).
@_date: 2014-06-16 05:54:42

It's stands for progressive scan (not pixels that one might think.
Progressive scan is a way to display a picture, all lines in a frame are captured and displayed at once. The other way to do it is called interlaced scan. That's why you have 1080p and 1080i.
All new displays and systems should and do use progressive scan.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:37:54
You verify a transaction together with the private and public key.
When you randomly create a public key, you will also generate a private key associated to it.  
If you just know a public key, it is today next to impossible to figure out the matching private key.
Private keys are not encrypted by default, but you can secure the private key in a software wallet to make it safe from hackers.  
Private keys just have a relation to public keys.

I think this is a false statement. Bitcoin the protocol itself is extensive and programmable as we've seen with new features such as P2SH/Multisig and upcoming things like CHECKLOCKTIMEVERY. The scripting language can be extended.
In that context, saying that bitcoin is programmable is only partly true, because you need miner consensus to implement new stuff.
With that being said, tools and applications can be built on top of the blockchain, and the reason is because Bitcoin is frictionless money, a public ledger and it's possible innovate on it compared to todays payment systems.

Yes, there are no problems spending a transaction with 0 confirms (unless it's newly mined bitcoins, which would need around 140(?) confirmations, otherwise wallet clients and miners would invalidate the transaction).  
*But* if someone was doing a  double-spending on you, it's possible that your transaction will become invalid.

By providing independent open source alternatives.
While I love them, Bitpay and Coinbase are no different than Visa/MasterCard and PayPal, if pressure comes to block organization or company X (like in the case of WikiLeaks), BitPay and co. will obey.
Sure, you can go ahead and say, why don't they just provide a simple text link and a QR code of an address? It's about having a convenient method of doing this, thus an open source bitcoin payment processor server is needed.

Yes using USD cash maybe is smoother but that's maybe not the reason OP wants to use bitcoins. (this is me speaking for OP) OP might see all the possibilities and opportunities a cryptocurrency can give and thus wants to promote it.
Maybe you should read up on bitcoin and not taking so ignorant stances.

The thing is that whenever I try to convince my colleagues that bitcoin is going to succeed, I end up losing the debate because things like transaction fees for debit card purchases doesn't visibly exist for consumers in Sweden, and they already feel happy with current payment methods. That's why I always end up with anti-fed arguments that just doesn't convince them.
I'm all confident in bitcoin but I don't really know how I am convince people. Oh I might as well tell you that my colleagues and I work as programmers, still showing zero interest from a technical standpoint (!?).

Yes, blockchain is a protocol that is considered secure, but bitcoin wallets can, will and has been malicious.
However, use wallets that lots of other uses, then the likability of being hacked is not big.
The wallet you should trust the most is Bitcoin-qt as it's the original reference wallet.

With "We" I mean those who believe in decentralized bitcoin world, which you obviously don't seem to do.
And also did you even read what I wrote? With NFC and other enhancements no bitcoin addresses are needed to be written.  
It's also possible that the Payment protocol will be extended with more BIPs, so that the transaction log could list the purchases made instead of showing the addresses.
I fully believe wallets on the phone can still act as a client without having a web wallet underneath. For savings and other things, I think a service like Coinbase/Circle will be used because it provides safety (2fa) and insurance.
Also with bitcoin comes a mind change. We no longer give all our responsibility to the banks, but instead need to act more carefully. This is the design of the bitcoin protocol.


Already addressed this above, but I want to point out that people seem to have no problems inputting bank codes when doing a bank transfer/paying a bill.

"Pay with phone in a store? Does ApplePay with NFC ring a bell?"  
"Pay online? Does PayPal ring a bell?"  
"Remittance? Does Western Uni....hmmf not sure about this one anymore"  
People are having a hard time understanding the benefits of Bitcoin (as seen in the examples above) just as they did with the Internet. But the case with bitcoin, we don't have a killer app (like email) yet, and we might never have *the* killer app (despite all the hype about the blockchain). However, I think this only means that the disruption will be delayed, Bitcoin will eventually succeed, because businesses will start to see the benefits with using Bitcoin, whether it be multi-sig, lower fees or flexible money transfer.

I think this would be the best.
We need variation, I don't believe it will happen, but BitPay/Coinbase almost have a oligopoly like Visa/Mastercard right now. (I believe in the long run, they wont be needed because companies wont need to convert their bitcoins to fiat, so a simply open source plugin would work).
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:13:16
But wouldn't it be the other way around? As more people buy bitcoins, the less bitcoins the exchanges have available. Supply and demand.
Also if lots of people are likely to buy bitcoins at price x, wouldn't the exchanges try to increment the price to x+1 instead of lower it? They still know people will buy at price x.

Suppose you've set up a seed for a HD wallet. If I understand correctly I'll then have a address based on the seed, and all new addresses will be derived from this.
What I'm missing is how/if a online wallet save this. Do they save each address derived from the seed or is this information available elsewhere?
Suppose I would load up this seed in another wallet, would I still be able to see all my addresses?

See quote from a BitPay employee.
And really, what's the difference? I can pay with SEK on a American website, they'll convert SEK -&gt; USD at the end. When companies see that the rate of bitcoin purchases increase, they'll get more confident in storing the bitcoins on their own and not converting it. After that has happened, B2B will take of, and we're on the way to the moon.

We really need a BIP standard for this though, as far as I know there doesn't exist one.

[Check my other post]( I think your offline phone needs to share a internet connection, because as well all know Bitcoin is a push system. The transaction needs to be related by your phone, not anyone else's.
It's possible to try out with Schildbach's Android wallet, the receiver shares internet connection by bluetooth and it works flawlessly. I did try it with both scanning a QR code and by NFC.
In the wallet, the receiver needs to check the "Accept payment via Bluetooth for more reliable processing" option.

Right now NFC with bitcoin only shares the address to the payer, but I suppose it should be possible create a transaction on your phone and then relay it to the PoS(or receiver device/phone), which will then broadcast the transaction to the network.

One thing that I feel people are misunderstanding is that 20MB blocks *won't make all blocks 20MB*.

Very good read, except for the highway part, I don't belive the transaction clutter will increase if we increase the block size limit.
This is exactly what I've had in mind for the last couple of months. An increase to 20MB will only delay the problem further, and as it is already hard as F to reach a consensus, it will be **completely impossible** with when we reach the 20MB limit (considering adoption is relative to the blocksize).
My proposal is just to remove the limit altogether, as the original code worked.

Are you crazy? No!  
They'll just settle down a system which makes the user *think* they got the money, but the actual money transferring process will happen in (normal) day batches.  
We have a system called Swish in Sweden that does this. It's a settlement between the major banks.

This is a huge problem.  
The solution I think is that we need to force or encourage miners to include more transactions in their blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-21 12:27:09
One thing people seem to miss is that, if 21 were to succeed, it will of course have competitors. I don't expect 21 to be dominant in the mining sector, although it is a scary thought.

I think it all depends on when governments start to intervene.
Let's take Internet as an example. If governments started to intervene early in its development, we may wouldn't have the free and open internet that we have today, I think the same applies to bitcoin.
\- With that said, I think you need to understand that there isn't just *one* government, but hundreds. And again, depending on time and development, it might just wouldn't be economically possible for a government to disrupt bitcoin.

My only problem with the whole debacle is that once we reach the 20MB block limit, it would be even harder to gain concesus, *if not impossible*.
That's why I'm with you on just geting rid of the limit (albeit that could lead to DoS attacks on the network) or yearly percentage increase.

Exactly, the thing is that Coinbase, Circle and other hosted wallets probably are what will make bitcoin mainstream, *not* a SPV wallet.
Hopefully it will be better in the future. I'm seeing it all play out as web browsers back in the 90s and early 2000s, where Internet was dominating the market and slowing down the development by not following W3C standards. But now we a have a much more healthy browser market.
With that being said, I don't believe hosted wallets will slow down BIP adoption, but there's a risk that hosted wallet companies will go their own path, look for example at Coinbase and their "subscription" feature.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:02:21
No... but give it another year.

It is impossible to know the number of addresses that are used (and have a balance of 0), because all addresses are actually already created, the thing is that when we're getting a new address we're just retrieving an address from the big list of possible addresses. It is practically impossible to get an used address because the number of possible address is too many to ever reach an already used address (2^160 possible addresses).
How many addresses that have a balance of &gt; 0 is also somewhat difficult to count, because we often use a new address for every received bitcoin

No it doesn't transfer the funds to the new address created.
HD works by using root a key that every address is created from. When a backup is created, that same root key is backed up.
When a backup is restored, the wallet client tries to generate your addresses by the root key. It generates the addresses and looks for funds in the addresses. In 5 sequents with no funds in the address, it stops searching. That's how the wallet knows when to stop.

Well I it might drop further.
The thing is that everyone seems to be waiting in the calm before the storm.
I expect the price to rise when the traders see and *realize* that there's a huge buy pressure. The pressure comes from adoption, but what I think is that the price will continue to stale or drop, even though adoption continues, until we hit a day where it will just dramatically increase.

Still there, one confirmation might be enough, because even if the blockchain orphans, the risk for a normal day to day transaction to be dropped to an doublespend attempt is close to 0, as all the miners should already have the transaction in the mempool when the miner recognized the orphan in the network.
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:34:26
I agree on everything except the price. I think 2015 will be an exciting year with all developments going on, but I still expect the price to not increase dramatically. More major companies will start accept bitcoin but the price and adoption will be unaffected. The companies pretty much prepared until prime time.
I think 2015 will be another "calm before the storm"-year.

This is just pure bad business practice, I'm glad we're getting rid of this. (I think Coinbase supports this though, but they aren't a pure bitcoin wallet)
But like said, a push-based subscription method would be pretty cool. With confirmation messages before sending the bitcoins. I've actually been thinking about this a lot. We will never get a pull-based on though, and I think that's more really good.

Just some information om how good our venture capital funded companies are handling this **very important** protocol:
Circle: No support  
Blockchain.info: No support  
Coinbase: No support  
Xapo: No support  
Yet our open source projects have supported it for a very long time:
Schildbachs Bitcoin Wallet: Support  
Mycelium: Support  
CoPay: Support (although problems with payment requests from Coinbase, WIP)  
I mean, Satoshi dice/bones could possibly work with hosted wallets (coinbase/circle) if they just supported payment protocol!
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:40:41
1. Could be API driven I guess, then I've no problems with it. If not, then yes, it's probably off-chain, this can be seen when trying to purchase gold here on reddit (uses Coinbase too),   
In the picture you can see that it defaults to "Use coinbase wallet", I'm 100% positive that this will be an off-chain transaction.    
  Side note, if you're not logged in to Coinbase while trying to purchase, the default screen will be one with a QR code, for normal on-chain transaction (notice the tab active "Use bitcoin address"),  This is good.
 However, this doesn't justify why they force you to register and login to their service when using the "Request bitcoins by email-address" (Circle does this shit too), they could simply just have a standard QR code in the email instead.
2. Off-chain transactions can be considered not bad itself, I'm just afraid of the possible centralization. Because, let's face it, skipping the transaction fee and doing instant off-chain transacion is pretty neat, but then again, why don't you just use a fiat money with a debit card?  
I don't want everyone to use Coinbase, I want variation, and frankly, anyone who believes in bitcoin should want that.
  I would rather see Coinbase working on payment channel solutions (if possible) to settle the payments, instead of doing it off-chain. they could possible batch in multiple merchants and payers in one transaction.  
In other words I want a **real** transaction to be made.

@_date: 2015-01-21 07:52:42
This is bad for bitcoin. We don't want one player to be too big and do these off-chain transactions for merchants.
Coinbase has a really good position for being a payment processor and at the same time have a wallet that can do off-chain transactions. It's really hostile for bitcoin, because they're not really promoting Bitcoin, they're promoting their own system that has hijacked bitcoin.
We don't want a "Facebook" of bitcoin.

Best way today is to hook them up with [BitPay]( they have good merchant apps for iPhone and Android. So you could basically install the PoS-system on a normal tablet and use it. They can also instantly convert 100% or a part of the received bitcoins directly back to a fiat currency (USD etc).
Android tablet that has NFC can also make use of NFC payments with Android phones (BitPays merchant app supports this).
Don't forget "Bitcoin accepted here"-stickers and add to [coinmap.org]( otherwise no one would have no idea that they do accept bitcoin.
Side note, blockchain.info also have [merchant application]( I don't know about converting to fiat though.

I think a lot of people are feeling uncomfortable with a currency that's not backed up by a government. They have all the security and they're good with the government printing money and making inflation, because that's just how the world has worked for a long time.
Now there are a truly disruptive new technology and currency that just work waaay different than any fiat currency out there. The uncomfortableness turn into rage and they spurt out emotional arguments against bitcoin, just because they don't understand how it works.

Women and men are free to join whenever they like, if they diss bitcoin for reason X, they can keep using their fiat money for all I care.
What's up with the "women love shoes and discounts" nonsense? I actually think your reasoning is pretty sexist. You're free to use your way to converting people, but don't make general assumptions and tell us that women can't understand Bitcoin and only like shoes...
And regarding discounts, I'm pretty sure humans overall love saving money, and I'm sure that merchants will start doing this when the time comes.

Many people just have dollar signs in the eyes, but there's nothing really wrong with that. It's rational, the bitcoin price needs to dramatically increase if it's going to succeed.
The thing is, so what if a lot of people will dump at $5000? Additional at $10,000 and $100,000,000, there will always be a buyer for each seller, it just helps distribution for those that can't hold it together.

Miners can chose for themselves on which threshold they will stop accepting transactions (e.g &lt; 0.00005 BTC in transaction fee). Transaction fee is a compromise between the wallets and the miners
*- until we reach the block limit*. Then fees will have to increase because of the demand to be in the next discovered block
Larger blocks will allow a fair play because miners can then choose to include more transactions (= more in fees) to the block, while still holding on to a fee threshold.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:45:52
Actually if they use BitPay, they can choose to wait for 6 confirmations.

In the beginning my girlfriend was surprised how fast and easy you can create new receiving addresses in Bitcoin Core, which is also pretty interesting.

@_date: 2015-01-28 11:39:57
The thing is that a node will drop any incoming double spent attempts (if the first transaction is already received), and for security BitPay/merchant needs to look out for double spend attempts within the network, when accepting 0-conf payments.
It might be partly more secure by using payment protocol where the payer directly sends the merchant the correct transaction, but it's still possible that a miner sets the double-spend transaction as the "correct" one and puts it in a block.

I disagree.
Normal miners (not governments) likely dump bigger parts of their income too.  
If price tanks it simply means that there aren't enough demand. Miners at this stage are *supposed* to give bitcoins to the people.
With that being said, I still think the most dangerous attack vector is targeting Bitcoin exchanges itself. While person trading is really good, I think we need easy to use exchanges for adoption to increase.

Schildbachs Bitcoin wallet supports "offline" sending via QR code or NFC, it does so by sharing an internet connection via Blueetooth to the payer.

@_date: 2014-12-12 17:11:54
They simply don't know what they're talking about.
Bitcoin is a public ledger, miners maintain the ledger. To get that running, miners need a reward (transaction fee, and currently also block reward). Because of that we need bitcoin - the currency, to make it work (to pay the miners to keep up the network).
One can like the blockchain and diss bitcoin (currency), but blockchain and bitcoin needs each other. If they really want blockchain to suceed, they absolutely *need* to embrace bitcoin.

If it were to come that governments would recognize every bitcoin address and every transaction, the Bitcoin experiment would be a failure.
Of course we won't reach such an extreme end game. New technologies will be developed handling the privacy issue, and we even see it today.


If bitcoin were to succeed as it works right now - as an pseudonymous system, they would not have more control. In fact they would have no control at all. Bitcoin and the blockchain is a censorship-safe system.

@_date: 2014-10-06 11:28:47


Eh... it takes several days in the traditional banking/debit card system.
One hour is just for the transaction to be "set in stone"... For small transactions, the way it's set up right now is that the transaction is confirmed directly by the payment processor, but they have watcher nodes that watch for double spending. So, usually for small things waiting for 1h wouldn't be necessary, so don't you worry when you go buy coffee.

Yes if the script used is considered bad/malformed (never the case for normal users).
Also when attempting to make a transaction where one input's bitcoins haven't been confirmed yet (someone might could fill on this one).
Also counterparty transactions are banned in one mining pool (don't remember which).
But to fully answer your question, yes miners can reject to add a transaction to a block (It could still be added by another miner though).

Yes, but they're not validating the signature part ("witness"), which means that they cannot really verify if a transaction is real.
@_date: 2017-01-21 21:00:27


What are you talking about? Alice cannot validate if the transaction is real, that is the whole issue.


True, she won't. I never said that she would consider it invalid, in fact she would always consider it a valid transaction (if she were to validate the transaction, albeit it's nonstandard), that is what the problem is.
But yes, 0conf is bad, but it becomes completely useless with a non-upgraded node, which should definitely to wait 4-6 confirmations.


Well... that all depends on the wallet software.  
A wallet software should inform the user of a payment to them, even though it is considered non-standard. But yes, confirmations are needed. 


No, it does not mean that 95% of miners have validated the witness portion, that is simply false. A rogue miner could trick the user for 10-20 minutes, before a longer chain is made.  
EDIT: It also kind of means that you're trusting miners to validate transactions, which breaks the purpose of Bitcoin in the first place. Fullnodes/yourself need to validate the transaction, miners need to do it to not fork of the chain.
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:46:26


Please quote yourself where you've said that. You have _not_.
But let me explain to you why Alice cannot really can't validate the SegWit  transaction;  
Because new strict rules has been applied and a new part of a transaction has been implemented (witness), Alice cannot guarantee that the transaction sent to her is really real/valid. The signature has been put in witness instead of scriptsig, and to make SegWit a softfork, the scriptsig of a transaction needs to be empty and the scriptPubKey needs to contain an OP_1 (IIRC) as the first OP code, to make it always validate to TRUE for old nodes (new rules apply to SegWit nodes). This is the essence of what is meant with "Anyone can pay"-transactions. For old nodes, it will look like it could be spendable by anyone (First OP-code is OP_1 in scriptPubKey to make make it always validate to TRUE). New nodes would be able to understand the whole consensus and understand that it is an P2PKH transaction, because what follows after the OP_1 is the "witness program", which will encodee the P2PKH script.
This is why non-upgraded nodes need to take caution and wait for a number of confirmations before knowing that is a legitimate. They need to trust that the miners aren't fooling them.
See BIP141, "Witness Program": 
EDIT: Also this from BIP141: 
So when I'm saying that Alice cannot verify that a transaction is real, what I mean is that Alice cannot verify the signature because scriptSig will be empty and placed in the witness. Alice can also not read the whole script of the transaction ("witness program").




Uh... yeah? I've no objection. 


That is why I think a soft-hardfork is the best solution.


Get off your high horse.


Where did I say that...?




No objection again... Do we even talk to each other anymore? Perhaps I was unclear what I meant to say.

You don't know if there would be a split.
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:31:44
Yes, that's why I found it weird that you wrote "insanely short signatures", if I understand it correctly, there would simply be no signatures for non-upgraded nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:46:39
Yes, whoever put up that medium blog, good job!
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:29:21


Old nodes would only see the output data of a transaction, it won't count the signature part (which has been moved to the "witness" part). This means a larger number of transactions per block than before, as the signature isn't counted towards anymore. This is why old nodes cannot fully understand segwit transactions, they cannot see the witness part, and the old place where signatures where places (scriptSig), is empty, that is essentially why it is an blocksize increase.
So yes, the limit for number of transactions is set to the same limit as we have today with the current consensus rules, _but_, if you would attempt to make such transactions, you would have your money stolen, as the conditions of the transaction script won't require you to put a signature inside scriptSig.


Well yes and no.
IIRC The signature and output data is about the same size, but the rules has changed to incentivize less UTXOs. The theoretchical limit AFAIK is 4MB, but we won't practically reach that before witness part needs to be filled, which means that 
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:12:53
What happens when an old node upgrades after SegWit has been deployed, will it request witnesses for transactions in old blocks or would it only validate witnesses in transactions going forward?
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:36:51
Which is not implemented.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:49:51


You really haven't. You've just said "No" in all too many words. Provide some real quotes from the whitepaper or Satoshi instead.
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:02:53


Probably not, perhaps guessing on infrastructure adoption is the  better alternative.  
If SegWit were to activate in the coming months, I don't think we would see anything near 2MB blocks, as not many wallets have pushed out their SegWit update yet (I'm aware that many projects/companies have their code ready).


Definitely, could there be a way to combat spam better?
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:04:18
I obviously meant what part of your reply...
But then we do not agree. I don't think the current fee market makes a lot of sense or that it shows that Satoshi's idea is working, fees make up a minority part of miners revenue and developing a fee market now at this stage, with a cap of 1MB makes 0 sense to me.  
I get the importance of fee markets though.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:50:58










But you won't elaborate on this! I've already stated very clearly why they cannot verify SegWit transactions. Would you perhaps reply to that instead of just saying "No"...?
Let me ask you a question, do you know what a softfork is? Because your ignorance clearly implies that you do not.


Where have I done that? _Elaborate_.  You can't just link the same BIP141 link to me again, lol.




If you want to refute something, you need to explain what you're refuting, and give an appropriate answer. That you won't implies that you've nothing to say. If you cannot handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.  
I've already explained in detail why old nodes cannot verify segwit transactions, and also the semantics behind "verify" in this context. Respond to that or we'll come nowhere. You claiming that I don't know what I'm talking about, while you provide zero technical information or evidence just makes you look stupid.




Again, _elaborate_. I have already explained why this is the case.


There's no misinformation, just you claiming it, which actually is misinformation now when I think about it.




Again... where am I wrong and unclear?
EDIT: Right, for the scriptPubKey, I stand corrected, the first OP-code indicates the Witness Program version, the encoded witness program that comes afterwards is what will always validate to TRUE in the stack for old nodes. This though, changes nothing about my message, just a slight inaccuracy on the softfork execution of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:52:45
How could it be committed to the main block? Changing the blockheader/blockstructure would result in a hardfork.
Is some magic going on, on network transport layer? Because I suppose you could add additional data to Extension block-aware nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:48:22
A hardfork would leave old nodes forked off the "mainchain"/longest chain. With a softfork, they will follow the longest chain. Even though they won't understand the segwit transactions completely, they will still consider them valid.
With softforking away the ability to make non-segwit P2PKH, you still force all old wallets/nodes to upgrade though, just in another more secure way.
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:58:06
So correct me if I'm wrong here but this will still be limited by "1MB" as UTXOs/output data will need to seen by old nodes.  
Essentially it would work the same as SegWit introducing the witness field for new nodes. 
How otherwise would old nodes be able to handle all UTXOs?  Or would some transactions outputs become hidden for old nodes?
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:21:00


scriptSig would be empty, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:34:59
If Alice they cannot validate the signature/witness part of a transaction,  Bob could just pretend to be Carol when sending to Alice.
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:23:59
For the thousandth time, SegWit isn't a prepackaging or recycling of a block. It is an effective blocksize increase for upgraded nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:38:35
Yes it might be an unnecessary restriction to implement. But then the sighash quadratic scaling problems are still a threat. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:53:05


This is all about semantics. OPs image is also somewhat inaccurate as well.


Who do you think you are to claim that?
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:52:17


SegWit makes the Bitcoin blockchain more valuable by fixing transaction malleability. That should be incentive enough, but there's a lot more.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:03:32
The most common argument I've heard is that miners can potentially game the system by spamming transactions to increase the blocksize "artificially", they could have incentive to do this to keep minor miners out of the system as you need more/better disk space/memory/CPU as the blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:16:55


This is simply not true, I don't understand how you can possibly claim this.
Segregated Witness gives additional block capacity if miners chose to mine SegWit transactions, as the witness would have a  discount when counting bytes.
Also, it is not only multisig transactions that benefit from SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:38:13
Ah, right! Thanks for the explanations.
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:40:23
Gotcha. 


Perhaps you could make a more correct humor based image to educate about SegWit. As evidenced by the twitter poll today, there's a lot of confusion going on, and I hear pretty often that people refer SegWit as some kind of repacking scheme, to make blocks more compact, which _kind of_ true, but nonetheless confusing.  
The best way to explain Segregated Witness according to me would be to refer to it as an accounting trick, that would hide the signature part of a transaction for old clients, effectively enabling larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:01:12
Well not really, transaction volume (or I guess transaction fees) needs to be waaay higher than it is today. Transaction fees stand for a tiny bit of miners income.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:34:16


Sigh... Where did I say that?
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:44:23


No, not really. The original purpose of Segregated Witness was to prevent unintentional transaction malleability. Do you understand what witness segregation means in the context? 


Of course. But Segwit doesn't really help here. Only indirectly with Lighting Network.
But yes, Segwit is good pruned nodes because the witnesses can be pruned, and also better for SPV-wallets because the witness data don't need to be sent to it.

It was a reply to this: 


@_date: 2017-01-22 21:37:00


I'm not sure if you can really claim that.  
Perhaps far far in the future, governments and states would have a strong incentive to prevent attacks (double spending, malicious soft forks etc) on the bitcoin blockchain, so they invest lots of millions (or even billions) of dollars on mining.  
I'm not really sure if you can claim that PoW cannot work with an empty mempool.
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:13:20
Not for old nodes.  
I think it's a big disingenuous to say that it is a blocksize increase, well yes it _is_ a blocksize increase, for upgraded nodes, but it's not a normal traditional one, which would require a hardfork.


Yes, but this is a bit of an unclear message. output data is responsible for the main limit, to fit into the normal 1MB blocks, that is why we'll never see 4MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-22 16:15:44


Well, miners could have a soft cap like we had before (750KB), but sure, then we rely on miners doing that, but in this case we rely on that the infrastructure won't upgrade fast enough.


Is there any proof that spamming is a problem? I guess the spamming attacks shows that, but miners found them to have sufficient fees.
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:32:45


Well yes a hardfork basically means they wouldn't accept either the block (i.e being too large, wrong merkle tree etc), or at least one transaction in it, which results in a hardfork as not all nodes and miners would be in consensus with each other.
But it doesn't strictly mean that they can't validate, they mark a transaction or block as invalid.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:36:05
Because we need to be sure it can't be gamed.
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:20:04


Do you think the number of SegWit nodes on the network today is enough, or do we need a much higher number before activation?
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:46:48


Well, it you could softfork to make it illegal to make new non-segwit P2PKHs.
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:32:51
Definitely. A transaction malleability fix is much needed.
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:50:18
Yes Adam, as I wrote, for upgraded nodes it is indeed a blocksize increase.  
Not so much for old nodes, which is why I think we need to differentiate between them two.
People already have a hard understanding how SegWit works, it makes it even more unclear to market it as a "blocksize" increase, because traditionally, that has implied a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:03:52

My apologies! I just realized that your image makes sense. I misinterpreted it.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:30:39
Fair point!


A softfork allows them to follow the longest valid chain, as softfork makes the rules more strict, while a hardfork expands the rules.
SegWit is a little bit special because it also adds a new part of a transaction on network transport layer to allow more new rules/stricter rules to apply.

The thing is,  we only got one shot in making this right. Once this settles down, and we have a winner BIP that is being used, there will never be another debate/change about block size again. The reason for that is that in the future, if we see that BIP100 is basically ruining bitcoin, we'll have too many players/miners/infrastructure that it will be impossible for a change to happen. Kind of IPv4 vs IPv6.  
My biggest fear is just as you said in your post, mid to short term miners do have incentive to keep higher blocks because they want adoption. The end game scenario will probably look much more different though. When the usage and adoption saturates, miners would have incentive to keep block size low to have higher miner fees.

Because then you would have to *trust* other counterparts about being honest about their pieces/blocks;  
Then you might say "Well duh, can't they not just send the cryptographic proof?" Well yes, then you end up with a full-node aka full blockchain.
* as other have pointed out, you could run a pruned node, removing old unnecessary blocks - but you still need to download everything and validate once!

It uses the existing BIP9 SegWit fork (so that existing segwit nodes will work), but it forces miners to signal for SegWit in Aug, otherwise their blocks will be rejected.  
This means that if exchanges and other bitcoin services run the UASF Segwit client, they will not accept the chain created by miners _without_ segwit signaling (should they not signal for it), which means that they won't get paid.

Yes it's true that you can send a bitcoins directly to a public key (instead of a PKH), but it is actually less secure, because (as far as I understand) it would be an easier task for a quantum computer to crack.

And looking at bitcoin at the *protocol level* makes it pretty straight and clear that a token of value absolutely needs to be used to reward miners.
With that said, other bitcoin forks could implement some kind of gimmicky smart contracts reward system, but in all honestly... what is the chance that it would succeed?

Information security is nothing exclusive to bitcoin, security breaches happens alll the time for all industries. If anything, bitcoin could probably help *improve* security management across all industries - with that I mean that with bitcoin, we will need to develop new security enhancements, and that could be implemented in other areas.

I guess you could run [BitPay Insight]( instead which supports a web interface.
@_date: 2015-03-05 11:51:57
The problem lies deeper than that.
It's faily easy to set up a "WNS", heck even using pure email addresses as recipients (as shown by a proposal by the Electrum team). The problem is where the system should point to. To what address? We all know that you shouldn't reuse addresses for security and privacy reasons.  
We could use xpubkey as the end-point, but I'm not sure if that's a good solution either, it's still a privacy issue.  
A centralized solution is easy, but we're supposed to have a decentralized system.

I am well aware of Schilbach's Bluetooth features.
It's not sending a signed transaction to the recepient, I wish it did though. the recipient is simply sharing internet connection via Bluetooth so the payee can broadcast the transaction from its device.

80 bytes OP_RETURN got enough ACKs, is it planned for 0 11?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:24:21
To further clarify, UTXO (unspent transaction output) is the database that all miners and nodes need to have to track all outputs (addresses) that can send bitcoins, meaning the end edge(s) of a transaction tree.
Now, to store data and information in the blockchain you should construct a transaction with OP_RETURN in the script. The reason why you should use OP_RETURN is because it makes the bitcoins unspendable, this means that miners and nodes can drop the address from the UTXO, which is **really** important for scalability.
@_date: 2015-02-18 10:39:26
Circle is really bad.  
Just until recently, they started "accepting" P2SH addresses, before the recent update one got an error message saying "Invalid Bitcoin address".

I was under the impression that a soft fork means that a new "rule" (whether that be a new OP_CODE or a change in the protocol) has been introduced, that will *still* be accepted by old nodes, but made effective by updated ones. Old nodes won't reject it (thus will not reject the block and therefore not causing a hard fork).
But you say here that majority of miners needs to be updated. How so? Do you mean for it to effective, the majority needs to be updated?

Do people here seriously want this?

Well yes people thought $300 would be the bottom, and so do people now.  
No one really knows, but there have been big buying pressures when the big sells down to sub $300 and sub $200 happened.

How do you know that? There are many more people now in the cryptospace. If the hashrate were to decrease dramatically, I would start mining and I'm sure that a lot of people would eventually do the same (thus bringing the competition up again).

Well, it was posted on Satoshi's account on p2pfoundation.
\- But Satoshi Nakamoto's GMX email account has been compromised so we don't really know if it was really Satoshi who posted.  
The only way is if Satoshi posted a message saying "I'm not Dorian" signed with his PGP key.

Did you read the article? It requires a soft fork (new op code) if we want a higher security model and make it more native.

I think this post is pretty silly. Comparing Pythagorean theorems with SHA-256 or any other hashing function that bitcoin uses makes no sense.


There's absolutely a *possibility* of a backdoor or a weaknesses in the hashing algorithm.
Possible? Yes.  
Is it realistic? Not really.  
Should we be worried? Not at all.

Signing multiple times *could* expose the public key *maaaybe* with quantum computers.  
It has nothing to do with exposing the private key.  It is not based on simple equations, there's a reason why bitcoin is using a elliptic curve for creating the public key from the private key.

Colored Coins protocols use OP_RETURN. I believe all major protocols use it (open assets, mastercoin, counterparty). I don't know exactly how the different colored coins protocols work but I believe they use OP_RETURN in a number of ways:
1. They use it to create a "genesis" transaction for the colored coin (unit issuance, name, etc).  
2. They use it for tagging a transaction as a colored coin transaction, also referencing to the genesis transaction.
As far as I know OP_RETURN data is *not* spendable, it just stores arbitrary data in the blockchain, nothing more. OP_RETURN has a lot of use cases besides colored coins.
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:24:30
Bitcoin applications use the operating system's cryptographically secure random number generator.  
I think you should be confident trusting it.
But I do agree that entering your own private key/seed should be an option (Bitcoin Core can do it I believe).

From Peter Todd, 


@_date: 2015-02-12 17:29:17
I would be more worried of miners stopping accepting OP_RETURN transactions all together.  
Once an OP_RETURN transaction has been added the blockchain, I believe you can't censor or prune it, because the Merkel Root will show that the transaction was there.
It *can* be pruned from the UTXO (database of outgoing tranaactions) though, but that's good and actually the reason to use OP_RETURN instead of other techniques, because it won't bloat the UTXO set.
OP_RETURN is provably unspendable and is only used to embed arbitrary data.

I disagree. I think giving too much power to miners is dangerous.
If they were to decide the blocksize, we would be stuck on 1MB limit forever.
