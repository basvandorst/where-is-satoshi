Don't be surprised if those days are back again.  Price went from $1100 to $200 last time, and history has a way of repeating itself.

Yet another reason why it won't get approved.

Yep in the altcoin space.

Not if he doesn't use his bank account for the trades.

That's like saying States can't control marijuana or heroin.  Sure to some extent, but that is small consolation to the tens of thousands of people rotting in prisons because they used these substances.  It could be the same for Bitcoin.

What's wrong with prostitutes, you puritan nutcase.

Where have you been.  They never said that they owed customers any money or that the BFX token was any kind of debt that they had to pay.

They are actually extremely successful entrepreneurs...got to think they are self-made millionaires from Paxful.

This really is incredible and just a reminder that a very significant percentage of the population are total pieces of shit thieves and scammers.
And also another reason to be your own bank, of course.

nope. All phone wallets aren't equal when it comes to security.  You don't have to pay the price of poor Circle mobile app security to have BTC in your pocket.
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:40:32
Yes 4 digit PIN is a total joke.  F*ck Coinbase and Circle too.

Of course bank execs never want an even playing field. They always want an advantage and they pay off many politicians to achieve that.

Don't introduce facts into the conversation.  The retard moonkids don't like facts.

They have goofy politicians in charge sometimes.  Awhile back, I think feminazis ran the gov't and made porn illegal and if you paid a prostitute, you would get thrown in jail for a long time and the prostitute would get no punishment.  It sounds like different people in power now though.

Interesting and of course properly secured BTC worth the same amount would not be detectable on a flash drive or laptop, etc.  Or in the person's head of course if they remembered private key or seed phrase.
