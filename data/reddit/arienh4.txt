Considering the canonical MitM is named Mallory, I'd reckon either, yeah.

It's an impressive combination of paranoia and naivete. How you can simultaneously be paranoid enough to consider that the US is MitMing all of Snowden's communications, many of which probably don't reach US(-allied) soil, but also somehow stupid enough to think Snowden would trust traditional PKI CAs is beyond me.
@_date: 2016-08-10 06:14:06
For one, you'd have to be in the middle to be able to do an MitM.

One thing I'd like to add. AD might be Belgian-owned, but it is definitely considered an influential Dutch national newspaper. De Persgroep does not publish the AD brand in any other country, after all.

You can call it corruption, but that doesn't make it so. Not legally, anyway.

Supply and demand are manipulated by government in fiat currencies. The "market value" itself isn't.

The term doesn't imply any sort of index. In fact, a lot of databases are concatenated transactions, with a form of external index alongside that.
These days, databases range from just transactions, to key-value stores, to the traditional form with schemas and indexes and all that magic.
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:07:24
How is it not? It's an organised collection of data.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:07:15
I know.
External implies 'not part of'. The point I was making is that an index has nothing to do with whether something is a database or not.
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:11:38
You don't actually know what you're talking about. And that's okay! But don't pull statistics out of your ass if you have no idea how to back them up.

Let's not try to make the understaffed IT dept's. life even harder. It's going to be very difficult to get everything you need without spending loads of bandwidth and not inconsequential time.
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:04:08
No you shouldn't. If you invite people to your house you have to tolerate absolutely nothing. It is entirely within your rights to tell someone who does something you don't like to fuck off.
@_date: 2017-01-31 06:45:58
Eh, I don't think it's hypocritical. Then again, the entire idea of 'Bitcoin will unite us' makes me cringe so perhaps I'm biased.
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:59:01
This is on private property. It's not censorship if someone asks you to stop doing something if you're in their house.

Yes, I am. However, that says more about how difficult it is to secure satellites in space than it does about our terran power systems. Protecting satellites is _incredibly_ difficult, and a direct hit with a solar flare is basically game over no matter what you do. That's why we have quite a lot of overlapping ones for most purposes.


Well, no. That's generally because of line of sight and speed of light issues. Most places we've sent probes to are not particularly more hostile than the vacuum of space itself is. Most electromagnetic hostility comes from stars, and that's not worse near any body of mass, especially not one we've landed on so far.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:52:38
Well, no. It would be a lot easier to build an EMP resistant power grid than to replicate the effects of the ozone layer and the rest of the atmosphere for a tiny artificial moon. Besides which, I'm not entirely sure how you intend to "switch off and switch on" a satellite. Once it's switched off, you can't exactly go and push a button to make it go again.
It's comparatively a lot simpler to just turn off the power grid for a while if you've got that much notice.
Honestly though, this is just a company trying to be flashy by renting some time on a couple of communication satellites and broadcasting data from them. It's not much different from satellite radio, which we've had for decades already.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:47:56


That's rather an incredibly massive assumption. If we're hit by a solar flare massive enough that it would knock out all the power grids in the world (which seems a tiny bit impossible to me, but never mind) it is absolutely impossible that a communications satellite is going to survive that. It doesn't have the atmosphere to protect it, after all.

As far as I can tell, they're using your browser's settings, not your IP address. Seems silly to use GeoIP when the browser already tells you what languages a user speaks.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:12:51
Because they'd like to keep their 501c3 status.
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:10:39
If you hate translations, set your browser's languages to only include English. Nobody's using your IP address to determine your language.

I'm not a rocket scientist, no, but I'm well-versed in physics enough to contemplate the concept of radiation shielding. You can go ask a rocket scientist though, if you'd like.


That is some really weird logic. You might as well say "if people are capable of building a power grid, they're capable of putting in contingency plans in case of solar flares."
Why are rocket scientists suddenly so much more capable than macro-scale electrical engineers? Electrical engineering at that scale isn't significantly easier than rocket science.

I think it's the trading it for fiat currency that upsets some people. Almost makes sense if you think you can force a revolution within a few years.
@_date: 2016-09-02 20:25:33
I get loads of the value I 'lose' back. I'm quite certain there's not many places you can favourably compare our public services too that levy less tax. Advantage of living in a country with a working democratic system is also that there's quite some control over how it is used.
None of the above would seem to apply to your otherwise incredibly tempting offer.

I'd be very impressed if merchants started to keep bitcoins themselves. It'd make administration an absolute hell.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:58:38
Nope. In quite a few countries, notably the UK, bupropion (Wellbutrin/Zyban) is only licensed for smoking cessation, and treating depression is considered an off-label use.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:59:56
It's not in the same family as fluoxetine (Prozac). Fluoxetine is an SSRI, whereas bupropion is an NDRI. They both have anti-depressant properties but they're drastically different.

Many. They get downvoted into oblivion, though, so you're not very likely to see them.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:12:56


So you're saying you are 100% sure that people will forever and ever stay interested in Bitcoin and keep buying it? Not cryptocurrency as a concept, Bitcoin as a concept, the current coin.
It's the exact same risk as investing in traditional effects like stocks and bonds. Yes, the chance of them becoming completely worthless is really low. But very existent.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:17:54
So how would you propose fixing the rather big issue of money laundering, then?
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:49:33




Do you really not see how contradictory that is?

That line of reasoning really does sound eerily familiar.

It is an EU rule. Specifically, [this one]( It's based on guidelines created by the FATF and ratified in all EU member states in laws governing financial transactions. As for the exact implementation in your state you should consult local lawyers.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:29:36
Yes and no. If someone reports it, that's additional information that feeds into the system so they can decide whether it needs to be followed up on or not. If it's not reported, it's a red flag and is immediately investigated.
There's not enough manpower in the world to process every suspicious transaction by hand, some shortcuts have to be taken.

That's like saying gold has intrinsic value because of the effort of pulling it out of the ground. The value of gold is not even slightly correlated to the cost of mining it.

Not going to try responding in German, but banks do have a duty to report high-risk transactions. It'd be rather hard to enforce a law that requires you explain high transactions if you can just make one without anyone finding out. The current anti-laundering directive in the EU is [here](
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:49:54
Well, the whole thing's based on the concept that it's a lot harder to get away with a lie than tell the truth. It's a whole lot of risk management, game theory and big data analysis.

Well, I do, because I don't believe you can say you want to do good if you're annoyed at not getting recognition. I think then you just want that recognition, and 'doing good' is the means to get it.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:26:48
It is a black-and-white thing, unless you want to argue that you should thank people sometimes and not other times for some reason.
I just don't believe that external validation should be a factor in altruism. It's perfectly fine to want it, natural in fact, but I don't think that your main motivator is 'doing good' in that case.
I'd find it really weird to be rewarded for not doing something that would be wrong, like stealing.
Anyway, I'm not going to convince you, and while I don't care about the karma, I don't think it's useful to continue a discussion where all my replies are hidden by downvotes anyway.
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:27:15
If you do good just because you want a reward, the incentive is the reward, not the doing good. It's basically a transaction at that point.
Telling someone who's struggling they will get something in return for just doing good is the wrong way to go about it. If you expect a reward and don't get it, the odds of you doing good again are lessened. If you don't expect a reward and get nothing, there's no change.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:49:26
It entirely depends on what you mean by 'exchange'. On a 'proper' exchange like NYSE you can't, but many brokers offer internal exchanges where they might have 10 people each owning 10% of a stock, and the broker simply holds the full stock and distributes dividend accordingly.

This is a great example of why Bitcoin will only ever be able to replace cash, not money in general.
