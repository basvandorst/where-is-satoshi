Nope the background is textured and oxidized
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:06:12
I used a solution called “black max” that speeds up oxidation. Then i repolish the raised spots to leave the background dark. There are a bunch of different ways tho

I was thinking that! Im engraving everything by hand so getting it accurate enough would be a challenge. Might be worth a shot tho!
