Look I'm happy that you've made money. That's awesome. If you realize it's never going to replace USD and doesn't belong in retirees pension funds then you do you. I'd rather YOLO on some options personally, but if crypto floats your boat that's awesome.

If Bakkt and Fidelity are going to unleash the flood of institutional money, wouldn't it be crazy NOT to buy at today's prices? Why aren't we seeing a spike in price after the announcements, or at least a generous uptick in volume?
I'm not convinced it's priced in, either, but the overall lack of activity and reaction to positive or negative news makes me think this market is really just controlled by a few large players who mostly react to their own insider info, or who arbitrarily buy/sell based on their own situations. You've got to admit it's a little weird.

The point is, the "value" of USDT flowing back into BTC will not be $1 for every USDT. Right now it's hovering around $0.90, and if shit really hits the fan, it could plummet until it's basically worthless. So even if all the remaining USDT on exchanges converted into BTC, that might be a very small amount when measured in USD.
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:43:58
Are you guys concerned that most of the companies playing to the bitcoin/blockchain hype have been circling the drain for years? We have Kodak, IBM, and now HTC?

Prices on USDT exchanges (like Bitfinex and Binance) are pumping, but prices on USD exchanges (like Coinbase and Kraken) are lagging behind. People are selling USDT for BTC because USDT is tanking right now. The spread between USD and USDT exchanges is currently about $750. This is not good.
Edit: Also, the prices you're seeing on Bitfinex and Binance are in USDT which is currently worth about $0.89 on the dollar. That's down from about $0.97 earlier today.
@_date: 2018-10-27 20:17:42
Except it kinda shows that bitcoin prices have no fundamentals aside from whatever manipulation is currently happening

@_date: 2018-10-15 06:48:11
Tether is crashing... currently worth $0.90 on Kraken. People are dumping UDST for BTC which drives the price up on USDT exchanges.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:39:07
You've missed your window of opportunity, I think... Last year when everyone was going nuts over bitcoin, it needed to show people how it solved a problem they had, was easier to use than a credit/debit card, or showed some other advantage that made people stick around and actually use it. 
Instead, we had a huge burst of activity fueled by speculation, and then [everyone disappeared after the bubble burst]( 
I know a do a bunch of trolling here, but if I can be serious for a minute, this place really does remind me of after the joke died. Mainstream people aren't coming back anytime soon. Eventually opportunists like IBM will move onto the "next big thing" and media attention is going to die out, too. Markets can be irrational for a very long time, especially opaque markets like crypto, but eventually as more and more people start to realize that the light is fading, they're going to be less and less active in this space... leaving only the die-hard hodlers who think that the next December 2017 is just around the corner, if only a few more sandwich shops in Prague started accepting bitcoin.
I guess what I'm really trying to say is, buy bitcoin so that you're not left holding the parasitic wealth of nations. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:08:07
Apple Pay doesn't require a bank account, you can send money to people through a text message, and you can actually spend it in stores and buy things with it. 
Unless these kids have hodlegang parents or want to buy some drugs, I don't see why a significant number would use bitcoin instead of any number of apps that are 100x easier and 100x more useful than dealing with bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:01:58
Another tiny little pump that gradually tapers down on almost no volume. Seriously, if Tether goes bust and Bitfinex and Co. aren't able to sustain the market, the order book is so thin we could be looking at a quick drop to $100 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:33:32
I realize there are several different camps with different visions for bitcoin. There is certainly the camp I am poking fun of, though... separation of money and state, world peace if governments can't afford to wage war, etc. etc. etc.

It's more like if a bunch of skydivers got together and decided they wanted to replace all other forms of travel with skydiving, and, whenever someone pointed out how that might not work they started yelling FUD.
I think bitcoin is a neat concept and it has its niche. What we have here is this unholy mix delusional moonboys and anarcho-capitalists who want to replace the world's economic systems with bitcoin. I would be more concerned if I thought this really had a chance of taking off, so I'm more here for the lulz and to hopefully provide some skepticism for anyone who's browsing through and hasn't totally drunk the koolaid yet.

If your card info is compromised and you pickup a few fraudulent charges, call your bank and they're going to reverse that for you right away. You're not liable.
Now, Newegg is a reputable place, but paying with a credit card gives you much much more protection against shady retailers on the internet. If your order wasn't as described, never arrived, etc. etc. etc. you have recourse with the trusted third party (your bank) who is your advocate. Seriously. If you have a legitimate problem with an order, 99.9% of the time they will side with their card member.
Let's say you paid with BTC, your order arrives, and oops, it's just a bag of rocks. Shucks. Nothing you can do except leave a bad review hoping that others will see it and avoid your mistake.
The worst part of having your CC information compromised is making a phone call to customer service and waiting for your bank to overnight you a new card. The added protection and reversibility far far outweighs whatever advantages a "push only" system has with consumers.
Edit: Also, should your bitcoin wallet be stored on a computer with access to the internet? Using a credit card doesn't carry any risk of someone emptying your savings account.

That's the argument, right? Kids are using bitcoin because it's so much easier and they don't have to have a bank account, then when they turn 18 and someone tells them they need to create a bank account they're like, "why? I have bitcoin, pops!"

@_date: 2018-10-08 22:24:36
I guess I'm not sure how arbitrage works in practice... do you have to withdraw from Bitfinex? If so, their USD withdrawals have been in limbo for about a week because of their banking problems. I haven't heard about BTC transactions, so you might still be able to buy on Bitfinex and sell on Coinbase. Either way, something's up because that's a large enough spread you should be able to make some money doing arbitrage.
Edit: Oh, this is related to Binance. Not sure how their withdrawals are doing.

What do you mean by free? Having no debt? In this scenario the only debt you have after, say, 25-26 is your house payment. You have to live somewhere though, and I'd rather pay a mortgage payment that's significantly less than rent *and* builds equity that you can use later.

From a usability standpoint in real world situations, it is a dinosaur. I can pay my friend for lunch in 5 seconds using Apple Pay or Venmo. He's now fully paid in the currency that he just spent.
If I'm using bitcoin I would need:
\- A balance that's not locked in an exchange or in cold storage
\- A friend who is willing to accept bitcoin (to replace USD that he just spent) and doesn't need this money in at least 2 weeks (assuming he will need to transfer to an exchange, sell it, and wait for the exchange to transfer USD to his bank)
In a world where everyone is using bitcoin for everything all the time, maybe it's easier, but in the world we're living in it just adds unnecessary steps for really no advantages.

If Tether implodes a large portion of bitcoin's market cap will also vanish into thin air. I think you're right that people will buy BTC to dump their USDT, though. We'll probably see some crazy prices on USDT exchanges when people do this. Who knows what USD exchanges will do, though.

I've never claimed you can't make money buying bitcoin. I'm highly skeptical that you can buy at today's prices and make a profit (let alone a 2x or even 5x return) but, who knows, stranger things have happened.

@_date: 2018-10-22 06:16:01
So guys, if the Tether situation plays out and BTC corrects to reasonable levels (let's say $20 a coin)... what's the big deal? BTC is arguably more useful since things don't have to be priced in weird 0.00001btc increments. As a currency it makes sense. It works even better as a quasi-anonymous transport layer for money. If it stays at around $20 longterm, even better.
@_date: 2018-10-10 05:40:47
This is what I'm talking about, guys...
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:13:15

@_date: 2018-10-08 04:35:12
Eh, if Tether collapses all bets are off. No more liquidity injections, no more propping the markets up at opportune times. All it takes is one or two exchange runs and your liquidity dries up and there is no market.

And if they were lining up, why didn't they use coinbase's offering? Instead they shut it down due to lack of interest.
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:58:17
So basically before Bitcoin split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, all of the bcash supporters hung out in They stayed there after the split and it became the unofficial/official Bitcoin Cash subreddit. It's confusing, but it made more sense at the time since it started before bcash was a thing.

I know this is a really unpopular opinion here, but the advantage of centralization is that the government can tug on the strings to hopefully steer the economy in the right direction. The fed's mission is maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This way, banks can lend money with 30 year repayment plans knowing, more or less, what they need to charge in interest to profit. Obviously it's not always perfect.
But like you said, if deflation was low and easily predictable that would be enough to prevent a situation where you borrowed $50k bitcoin and have to repay it with $3,000,000 bitcoin. You'd just need to actually find someone who's willing to lend you bitcoin...
One argument I've heard is that people would be less frivolous with money and buy only what they need to survive. They'd save and pay for everything up front (cars, houses, college).
Personally this isn't a world I'd want to live in. Only the wealthy could afford to send their kids to college, which means they're probably landing all the skilled jobs, which means the poor stay poor and the wealthy stay wealthy. I'd also rather not save for 30 years to buy my house. :P

So the difference here is that the government has to have probable cause and ask your bank to share this information with them. Meanwhile, bitcoin just broadcasts this to anyone who's curious (including the government) and they can go to town seeing which shady transactions you  may have made.

The beauty is you can opt-out of this system if you want.
1. Drive older cars that are paid in full
2. Use debit or pay off your CC statement in full every month
3. Student debt is a tricky one, but if you majored in something useful it's not going to wreck your life. Buckle down for a few years after graduation and pay it off ASAP. 
4. Housing is another tricky one, but there ways around it. Put 20% down on a reasonably sized, older house that needs renovation. Live in the house while you renovate. By the time you're done, you'll have plenty of equity.

I’m telling her “Well honey this is real” “No no no no no no, that’s a scam!” And I say “But wait I’m gonna go to the banks, I’m gonna get my bitcoins, I’m gonna actually put it into dollars, here they are right on the table!” “Aww, that’s money that you took from one of the accounts!” I say: “What am I gonna do?” Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I started to put ten thousand dollars a day on her, right on her, y’know on her table” Then she’s gonna say: “WOOOOW.” HA-HA-HA-HA-h. “YEAYEYEYEYEYE OK, THAT’S REAL” HAHAHAHAH

Oh okay, thought it was well known. Sorry.
There's a spread between USD and USDT exchanges probably because of the risk of holding Tether right now. USDT is also worth a little bit less than USD, which means that Bitcoin is a little more expensive on Tether exchanges.

It's not a conspiracy... last night Tether was down to $0.85. BTC on Finex reached $7,800 momentarily while Coinbase was at $6,800. It could be a whale intentionally manipulating things, but the effect on USDT exchanges when Tether devalued is pretty obvious.

So I'm ready to buy a house... I take out a loan for 20 BTC. 10 years pass and BTC value has increased 10x. I'm now having to repay my original loan in money that is significantly more valuable.
Are my wages going to increase 10x, too?
Edit: Similarly: I go to school, I take out a 500 BTC loan in 2012. I graduate and now I now have to pay back $3,000,000 worth of BTC at today's valuations. 
This is why small, predictable inflation is desirable.

I understand your premise, but regular consumers by and large absolutely do want the protection and convenience of using a credit/debit/charge card. Obviously VISA has to make money, too, but that's just part of being a business. They are providing a service that people want, and they get to charge a fair price for it. Luckily there's enough competition in the market that their pricing has to be competitive, and newcomers like Square are forcing them to adapt. 
So in your scenario, I order a GPU using Bitcoin from a shady vendor on the internet and receive a bag of rocks. I should now call the police and have them deal with it? I'm sure they will be able to compel the seller in who-knows-where to refund me my $300 worth of BTC.
I'll give you another scenario... a few months ago I booked a hotel using Expedia. For some reason they decided to charge me twice. I had to call their customer service number 5 times trying to get it reversed because they kept putting me on hold to "research" the issue and then disconnecting me. At this point I was frustrated enough that I called my bank, explained the situation, and asked for them to reverse the second charge. Easy peasy. 
If I'd paid in BTC, I'm entirely at the mercy of Expedia to refund me. I have no recourse aside from leaving a bad review and talking about it on the internet like I'm doing here, lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 05:44:55
Well this isn't good
@_date: 2018-10-10 05:36:26
Well, pay your card off in full every month and you don't pay any interest. 
As for credit card fees... as a consumer, use a card without an annual fee and one that gives you cash back. If you're talking about merchant fees, yeah, you'll have to pay those. It's still significantly cheaper than accepting Bitcoin though.

I agree there's certainly firms out there looking for high risk investments. The argument I've seen flying around is that bitcoin belongs in your 401k and backing pension funds, though, which are both usually very conservative investments. 
To me, it seems like the "institutional" money is more likely to fund exchanges and other startups rather than just buying BTC at market value. Better to sell shovels than dig gold, ya know?
In my opinion, all of this institutional money seems more like the last layer of bagholders so that the big guys can cash out without crashing the market. Bitmain is doing the IPO route, others are looking for their ways, too.

The fact that they're not buying as much USDT as they can at $0.85 - $0.95 on the dollar is concerning. Let's imagine for a moment that all of the Tether is actually backed. If they buy back a Tether at $0.90, that's a free 10% gain immediately. They no longer have to keep that $0.10 in reserve.

The NYT thing? Well this was like 2008 and with the financial crisis, online publishing coming into its own, and print media declining, it was just an interesting thought that their share price was less than a cost of their paper. Doesn't mean anything, but ya know, it's interesting in that "huh" kinda way.

I'm not trolling. All my friends are institutional investors and they are constantly asking me how to buy bitcoin. Can you help them out?
@_date: 2018-11-08 05:22:38
Um... except for just using a credit card.

Bakkt was being developed in the mania stage of 2017... I'm sure they did research, but the situation has definitely changed since then.

Do you own a coffee shop?
Because when I buy a coffee, my bank gives me 4% cash back.
Edit: Dude, your card has a $4.99 monthly maintenance fee AND it doesn't give you cash back? And banks are the ripoff?

Mate, try finding a house you want to live in for less than 200k. Then tell me I'm supposed to buy that in cash. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 00:41:34
That's why I tell people that I'm not buying bitcoin... I'm *selling* dollars.

$50 transactions back in December sure were efficient.

Your interest rates are going to be sky high since bitcoin is supposed to appreciate in value every year. You're also borrowing bitcoin with very high interest rates, and also have to pay it back in bitcoin that becomes more and more valuable in the future.
Right now a mortgage works somewhat in the buyers favor because they are are repaying over 30 years using a currency that becomes gradually less valuable over time.
Imagine buying a house on your credit card with 20% APR and also every year your balance owed increases 10%.

or maybe they do understand it but came to a different conclusion
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:02:51
Then why are you paying to use a credit card? 
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:27:35
I heard from a reliable source this is the case. It's practically guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:55:06
I get the argument, but realistically this is never going to happen.
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:14:57


@_date: 2018-11-08 07:00:52


My point is, banks don't charge customers credit card fees. They actually give you cash back in most cases. :)
Now if we're talking about cards that can never be frozen, this is just false... your card there is using EML as the processor, which could decide to cut your coffee purchasing power at any time. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:26:01
Finally! Thanks for the heads up, this is fun.
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:59:53
I'm what you call a nocoiner. I really didn't have any strong opinions about bitcoin either way, but around December I was curious and started reading and that turned me from "eh, it's cool I guess" to "yeah this isn't the future".
@_date: 2018-11-09 02:54:54
This is some prime whataboutism...
Anyway, I think most people's issue is that bitcoin mining is using a ton of energy and doesn't really provide any benefit aside from a few people striking it rich. I know you're going to disagree with me, but outside of diehard bitcoin circles, this is the general view.
Other industries do use as much, even more power, but they also provide value to society (like banking, payment transactions, jobs, skilled labor, etc.)
@_date: 2018-11-08 07:12:50


Don't make a late payment, or use a debit card. It avoids that $4.99 monthly maintenance fee that card is charging you. :)
Look it's cool that you're able to buy things with bitcoin... just admit that it's not easier or cheaper than just using existing methods.
