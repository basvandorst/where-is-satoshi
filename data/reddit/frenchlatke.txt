Just what I needed, thank you!

Greetings from the jury assembly room! I just got into bitcoin and don't have changetip yet, so I'm not exactly sure how that works, but happy Tuesday!

So I'm looking at that right now because I'm using Circle. Can you recommend the Blockchain.info [chrome extension]( cold-storage addresses? I'm not even sure what to do with them, it's an unspecified file type that opens in web browsers and displays the paper wallet information. Should I put this on a flash drive? How can I trust that the generated address hasn't been compromised?
Any help appreciated, thanks!

[Done!]( (No one wants to be here...) And thank you very much! Now I have no excuse not to set up an account. I wanted to check out the Facebook integration anyway.

I've wondered about this - doesn't that technically spoil the security of your cold storage?

Good luck stealing from my brain wallet.

He seems like a solid gold bear, so I think it's flattering either way.
I hope he thought really hard about this sentence:


And further:


All time highs? Sounds like a great buying opportunity. /s

Good on'ya NYT.

This person deserves an upvote for the username at least.
Also I'm drunk.

Same here,  FWIW

Just purchased a 10$ Google Play Gift Card, and I'm definitely satisfied. Took exactly one hour to receive the redemption code.
No credit card info for you, Google.

Good timing. This was front page news this week:

$500? I'm still limited to $100 a week - am I the only one?

Raise the roof.

Saw this on Ars recently and thought the same thing. People are simple, or to be fair, we all have limited time to dedicate to various endeavors.
Still cringey though...

It's more like playing dice in front of the ATM.

I was wondering this too, but it seems plausibly deniable. I don't see how they could prove that you didn't send those coins to some ruffian gambler. 
I'm not responsible for what someone does with cash after I hand it to them, right?

I'm curious where contraceptives land in those stats.

Will I face any consequences as a bitcoin user planning to visit or move to Ecuador? How will they attempt to ban it?
Also, since Ecuador uses USD, how might this affect the value of the dollar? They mentioned backing every digital dollar with a physical one, but this certainly could expedite money creation.

It's also manipulated by whales. Obviously these people with lots of dollars want everyone to use them; clearly a ponzi scheme.

This isn't even his final form.

All part of the plan. I'm not saying limited hangout, but I won't rule it out.
