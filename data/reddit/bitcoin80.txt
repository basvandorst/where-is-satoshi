So, to check that I'm understanding you correctly...
By using Electrum, a new wallet will be created with a public and private key and a 12 word phrase. 
Once I close Electrum, this 12 word phrase and private key will disappear and I will only ever be able to retain it by using the 12 word phrase in the future.
I can then transfer bitcoins to and from this new wallet using the public key whenever I want.

So all I will need to record is that 12 word list?
Also, will running Electrum create a new wallet that I can transfer bitcoins to from my Blockchain account?
Sorry if these are really stupid questions but I'm a tad confused by all this...

Blimey. I might be misunderstanding some of these posts but it looks to me like the answer is that there is no real secure way of using bitcoin just differing shades of grey...

I don't understand why you have to keep the public address private (so to speak)?
I thought that your public key could be out in the open without it being a security issue. After all, that's how you use it in transactions, right?

Ah, I know you're right. I guess it's a good a time as any to take the leap.

Awesome. I feel a bit clearer about things now. 
Thanks for your help, Cowboy_Coder!

Thanks for the advice. I got a 12 word phrase when I created a Blockchain wallet so what is it that makes Electrum safer than Blockchain?

I feel that this is one major issue with Bitcoin at the moment. I'm concerned that there will be some major security events as it gains more traction that will scare the mainstream away.
