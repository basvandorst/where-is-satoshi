John Oliver's stuff is always blocked for about two weeks. 
He's one of our greatest exports, and you yanks get to have first dibs on him.

Thanks OP. Very curious as to how you're doing this.

Terrifying? Eh. It's basically a hobby now, but people still love the amiga, it still inspires :)
Blender has been ported. OpenOffice is in progress. Firefox was ported, but is now an old version, sadly.
Take a look:

I was wondering the same. Bitcoin doesn't enable this behaviour at all.

AmigaOS ftw. 4.1FE came out recently btw.

His inverter isn't grid tied, so that's not applicable in his case. Electricity only goes from the solar system to the bitcoin miner, it cannot go to the mains line with his current setup.

You know what he meant by "Bit-Coins" . You knew *exactly* what he meant. And you are being deliberately awkward to win some silly little game of one-upmanship that only you are playing. It must be nice to never make a typo or small mistake on an online forum.
Your point was valid, but the first few words really distracts from it, and frankly makes you look petty.
Elitist attitudes like yours will only serve one purpose; to push people (especially newbies like myself) away from bitcoin. Unless of course, that's your intention.

So... We're going to run out then?

Skhreli has made it very clear he isn't going to answer any questions at these hearings. 
They tried their luck the first time, realised it wasn't bluffing, and I assume they made the common sense decision to not waste everyone's time.

I thought it was more funny that he mocked for your use of caps, and then proceeded to use them himself.

If it was never banned in the first place, yes.

As long as it's made by Acme!

Are you trying to tell me is overreacting to some hearsay and wild speculation because it might actually mean bitcoin is somehow becoming marginally more relevant?
Wow. That's never happened before.
