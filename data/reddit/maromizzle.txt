If I believed Bitcoin were like the Jaguars, I would start buying the cryptos like the Patriots, Steelers, and Packers.

I completely agree.  Bitcoin doesn't neet NY.  I just see NY as a place that could serious help lift off in the short term.

This is amazing I would love to do that.

How about when it hits $1000.

Buying a bitcoin miner is HIGH risk, the only way they ROI is when BTC heads to the moon.  These companies love to over-promise and under-deliver.  Just buy BTC people.

KnC started mostly legit by getting out their Saturns and Jupiters relatively on time.  This equipment was beta but after enough firmware changes by KnC  to figure out I had a bad board was my Saturn running 100% three weeks after I received the miner.    I am one of the few ASIC miners who actually ROI'd like a motherfucker from KnC.  I recieved a ~285GH/s in late October 2013.  Their was no guarantee my shit would work properly or come on time, so I really lucked out. This equipment shipped in Oct/Nov 2013 greatly increased their credibility, but clearly they did not anticipate the difficulty would increase this fast or that they would not deliver on time with their next gen miners. My sympathy goes out to the folks who made the poor investment choice of buying an ASIC from KnC after the first wave. 
I do hope KnC gets what's coming to them.  The ASIC mining industry is a bunch of giant douches vs turd sandwiches.

True, I got my cities mixed up.

Very smart place to keep 40+ gallons of water!  That is for sure.

Bitcoin isn't Portland.  Sorry, I am not a fan.  This makes more sense if you're a shibe, and to me bitcoin isn't really comical.
2 cents distributed.

NYC is the largest city in the US we need bitcoin to thrive there.

The first thing you should tell about anyone investing their hard earned $$$ on bitcoin:
ONLY SPEND WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

This is awesome....let the corporations fight the future legal/government battle for bitcoin. :-)

I am sorry for your inconvenience, but you should take this opportunity to learn how to balance a checkbook.

I would recommend switching banks if you have the option.  I totally agree that banks suck. :-)

Don't most exchanges have daily buy/sell limits of ~50BTC?  How could the small amount of "big holders" do enough damage cashing out 50BTC at a time?

Just another ignorant article trying to fabricate ways to discredit (what will hopefully be) the end of modern banking.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:29:07
Just one small step... :-)
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:13:28
Yeah, it REALLY looks to be failing.  Continue looking for articles that don't stimulate your intellect and spark your confirmation bias.  Do you realize how much money you pay in sales tax or how much money business pay in credit card fees?  10 cents is jack shit.

"There aren't stupid questions, just stupid people".
But seriously in order for Bitcoin to succeed we must inform the ignorant in a helpful way.
Since Bitcoin is decentralized, those who believe in it must take ownership and pride in helping others.
