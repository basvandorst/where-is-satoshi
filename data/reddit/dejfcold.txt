We could also abandon blockchain altogether and use only LN built on it. That would mean no committing, no mining, no new Bitcoin and I don't have any idea, how would you create new wallet and open the channel... I'm not very familiar with that, but isn't it what IOTA does?

The ultimate target of bitcoin isn't deflation aka rise of value, the ultimate target is nearly constant value affected only by world population growth and to be usable anywhere and by anyone. The first is probably highly unlikely due to other cryptos (but that would be like USD and EUR etc. except everyone could accept what they want and wouldn't be forced to use the national currency) and the second and third - we are far from that and the technology isn't ready for it yet. But that's what we'd ultimately want.

Is that a thing yet?
I was planning to make it, but I haven't figured out how to make the terminal trustless without the need for you to confirm the transaction on your phone (if using just a smart card or any other passive device).
I haven't researched the terminals yet, but I guess if we were to trust the terminals, it would require just a modification of the current software. If we were not, we'd have to make a custom one.
I remember seeing that in parallel polis you can pay with NFC implants, but their solution combines both problems - it requires trust while also being custom built.

I did meant cards, because most people like them and not very banks support mobile payments yet. (Apple pay is getting attention this year, Samsung pay is nowhere near and Google pay is available here for a year or so. I had to get a revolut card, because my bank used custom solution which was as slow as finding the card in the wallet)
NFC payments with phones are easy thanks to BIPs 70, 71, 72 and 73(?) so you just sent an URL with request from the terminal and accept it in the phone which afaik is super easy as you can assign different URL protocols to open different apps automatically (unless multiple apps are assigned to one protocol)
But it kinda doesn't matter to me. I was just thinking about increasing adoption with inferior tech.

Can't give any recommendations though.
@_date: 2019-03-06 21:58:24
How would you pronounce them in slang?
* 25 hundred-thousands of Bitcoin
* quarter of miliBitcoin (since it's not quarter of bitcoin, you can just say "a quarter")
* 250 Bits
* 25 kilo Sats/ 25 K Sats
I think it's important to think about slang too. Now you have a quarter for $0.25. I've heard people say 25 \[pee\] for pennies. These are logical shortcuts though.
In my country, hundreds are referred to as kilo and thousands are referred to as liters somehow. So when you say "You owe me 2 kilo" you actually say "you owe me 200 CZK" and similarly when you say "you owe me 2 liters" you really say "you owe me 2000 CZK". But when you say K instead of Kilo, it means thousands again - "you owe me 2K" = "you owe me 2000 CZK". Fiver actually means 10 CZK instead of 5, but tenner is still 10 CZK. So slang is important and confusing, but it will probably emerge on it's own.  
Does actually any slang exist for Bitcoins already?

So if I ran my own node, what would happen if I had some problem (with electricity or internet connection)? I would not be connected to the network, but the LN network wouldn't know it until it would need something from the node. (eg. ping, transaction, etc). The node would not broadcast "hey, I'm shutting down". Would the incoming transaction just take another route or it would wait until the node is connected again? And what if it failed during processing the transaction?

I wanted to get the price in beers, but after the calculation I realized 1 BEER ~= 1 EUR. At least here in CZE. But it's too volatile. It floats between 1USD and 1EUR - depending on exchange. The worse the exchange looks, the better rate though.

I don't think they would care about age. It can't be against TOS, because bitcoin doesn't have any TOS. Sure, the exchanges have, but you wouldn't be dealing with any exchange in this case - they could still teach how to use one though.  
Just like you can exchange GBP and EUR with any other person, you can exchange GBP and BTC. Unless, of course, you have to have r/loicense for that too. That doesn't mean the folk wouldn't just ignore that law.
Good people disobey bad laws.

The best and easiest way would be to visit some local crypto community personally. They'll gladly help you out and explain whatever you need to know while also answer you questions right away. They could even introduce you into [contracts]( \- which would be ideal for you as it minimizes the need for trust.

I wouldn't use ATM to send someone bitcoin. I'd setup a new wallet and send the bitcoin from the ATM there (even though I believe the ATM generates a new paper wallet for you - but you might not be the only one having the keys to that wallet). That way, I'd still have control over the BTC. Then I'd probably look into escrow services for bitcoin (I haven't used one yet, so I can't make a recommendation) and use that.  
ATMs are great if you don't want to give away your ID or if you're a minor. I used one recently to withdraw fiat because I've lost access to an exchange and didn't want to go through the process of IDing myself again.

Well, nothing is ever hacker proof. In the best case scenario, nobody yet found a breach so we are convinced that it is, the worst case is, we are ignorant and haven't even heard about any breach while it's well known among others and they happily exploit it.

Seems like we don't understand each other. I just claim nothing can ever be hacker proof. Not even the simplest hello world program. There's only good enough security for the application at stake. Which may very well be your definition of hacker proof.

but isn't core "overhyped 'anonymous' developer"? I mean, you may know what people are in core, but can you trust them? How do you know, they don't take bribes? Community will check, right? Wrong! Community may not notice. Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless and decentralized and yet you talk about trust to devs and there is centralized development. (Just food for thought)

"It's open source" is not an argument. If you're ordinary user with no tech background, you need to trust others - that's where trustless goes away (but I can't really think of better solution).
It's on github only (AFAIK), I'd bet most of those who compile from source, download the source from github and github only. That's the place where it's centralised.
I kinda realized I shifted a bit from one point of view to another. On the other hand I'm not arguing against Bitcoin, just trying to point out, where might be the weakest point. As of now, GitHub seems like the weakest point.

- HODLers don't own 100% of bitcoin (it was already mentioned)
- If there is 20999999.9769 BTC in the end or just 1 BTC of live BTC while the rest is in dead wallets, it doesn't matter. The market will correct the price itself. All we/devs have to do when it happens is to allow more decimal places. This means **FOR EXAMPLE** when 1 satoshi will have a value of current 1BTC, being able to pay in mili-,micro- or even nano-satoshi. I don't think community would allow increasing number of max amount of BTC, but I don't think they would be against increasing the decimal places. Both of these changes would need similar modification of the protocol. That is using something bigger than 64bit integers. Eg. using 128bit integers instead. And shifting bits to the left. This was my thought process. See this for another opinion on how to do that  *(includes links to another threads)*
