I agree with you up to a point, but I do believe there is room for a trusted economy. What is amazing about bitcoin is that for the first time the decision to participate in the trusted economy is truly a free choice. The trustless economy built on bitcoin allows us the freedom to either hold our private keys or to trust another with those keys in exchange for interest payments. Before bitcoin, one was forced to trust centralized institutions lest their value be siphoned off by inflation, but now one is free to do whatever they will with their money--including trusting a 3rd party with it. (Though I tend to agree that it oftentimes remains a bad idea, à la Cyprus for example.)

Good news. Isn't this only the sixth BitLicense that's been issued?

I'm not saying I'm a bitcoin maximalist...I'm saying the bitcoin is the only blockchain mature enough to bank on at this point.

This is in fact gold. Thanks for posting!

I think there are certain industries that are desperate for blockchain technologies and others that have nothing to gain by their use\-\-we all know that the universe of asset ownership and control needs it. 
I work for an IoT company called Mesh Systems and we have a lot of experience with the intersection of IoT and blockchain. We have a lot potential customers who have heard all the buzz words and they'll come to us looking for "an IoT solution that leverages blockchain and AI." Most of the time a permissioned database will do the trick more quickly and cost\-effectively. IoT \+ blockchain makes the most sense when there is a consortium of partners collaborating an a very horizontal problem, like supply chain. It will also be necessary for the advent of smart cities and projects of that scale with potentially hundreds of thousands of disparate end users.

Kudos for operating a full node!

I wonder if they are testing software for when the block reward does in fact drop to 6.25 BTC during the next halving.

Welcome to the fold! I've been buying bitcoin for just over a year now, but I remember well how I felt when I bought my first $10 worth. Cheers!

I really hope that the viewpoint espoused in the quote is a small and powerless minority. If you were to substitute the words 'men' and 'feminism' in that quotation with the terms 'Jews' and 'Nazism,' you'll see how precisely terrifying such a sentiment is. Supporting equal rights, equal opportunity, and living with decency and respect towards all people is the way forward.

For sure, this is just like a futures contract. Someone could buy a certain amount of block space at a set fee and depending upon what happens with transaction volume could sell the contract off or let it expire. Really cool idea!

I'm not sure what kind of impact having such a public facing ticker price for bitcoin would mean for it's price, but I think it would be a strong indication that bitcoin is here to stay. Every day, we would be reminded that the asset exists and it would slowly bleed more and more into the mainstream.

They're way better than harmless. Targeted advertising is great for the whole market. I only see stuff that interests me and I'm more likely to buy something I am interested in and so that means the money spent to put the ad on the website was more likely ROI positive. Admittedly, the amount of data required on a user to generate effective targeted advertisement is a bit frightening, but I wish we would solve the hard problem of how to sell a  customer's interests without compromising their privacy. That challenge would produce a whole host of innovative ad technologies. Way better than throwing in the towel.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:03:51
I think so too. The sooner the better.

The Leftist narrative of group identity needs to be put by the wayside. Bitcoin means many things to many people. To me, Bitcoin is about making the world a better and safer place. To me, Bitcoin is about giving freedom to the individual and taking away the ultimate power of monetary policy away from central banks. Bitcoin quite literally has the power to dethrone dictators.

Mentioned in the context of the history and development of money, but still exciting nonetheless. I am off the opinion that even the smallest proliferation of bitcoin in the public consciousness (especially when such proliferation doesn't involve price) is important for the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Great work! I'll be doing something similar in just a few days. I've been looking online for small, refurbished PCs to run the node.

Thanks for sharing the link. This article was really good and your point about different goals is true. That being said there is definitely some bad blood between the various schools. We need to learn how to accept our differences, go separate ways, collaborate when necessary etc.

Can someone send this to CNBC?
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:12:55
This is a fascinating idea. There's probably a whole slew of financial products and asset classes that have yet to be discovered or thought of based on similar lines of thinking. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:41:31
I certainly hope not, but the free market will have its way.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:25:41
This is fantastic. I used to live in Paris and travel back often. I can't wait to stop here for a delicious *sandwich jambon* and support the adoption of BTC next time I'm back.

I agree that multiple schools of thought are necessary to approach the complexity of the reality. 
The main issue I had with the article was the thought that smart contracts are completely useless because they obliterate decentralization or that they are confined to the digital world. There was an article posted to the subreddit this morning that argued that Proof-of-work Per Bitcoin (PPB) was a way of tying the blockchain to the physical world (i.e. energy consumption) and I think this opens up a plethora of other ways that decentralized 'oracles' could be used in smart contracts.

Great quote, thanks for sharing.

I don't think this is categorically true. There are many anarcho-capitalists in the crypto bunch, but there are also those who simply desire government to be smaller and more limited. One of the things that I find interesting to think about is the role of an individual country's or bloc's monetary policy in a bitcoin-dominant future. I think there will absolutely be states the buy and hoard bitcoin when the economy is booming and then release it when the economy slows. Part of the reason for this is that the trusted economy isn't going to disappear just because bitcoin is ubiquitous. Some will hold their private keys; others will trust others with them.

Literally laughed in the middle of my quiet work office when I read this.

Decentralization is important and the example you cite is exactly the reason why. Centralization in the payment processing world has led to real problems. Retail is already a low margin, high volume hustle and the proliferation of credit card payments takes another 2-3&amp; of the top to the credit card company and the payment gateway gets approximately 2.5 cents per transaction as well. This puts real pain on retailers. Worse, it created a secondary market where people's transaction history is for sale as a credit score. There are 3 companies in the United States that hold all of that data. One was hacked last summer and 1/3 of all Americans had their information stolen.

I love it. Ignore the haters. Any one with any taste or knowledge of the history of money know exactly what your conveying with this piece. Cheers!

It's ironic and somewhat fitting that bitcoin users and advocates, for now, find themselves without a legitimate political home in the United States. You'd think that freedom would always be in vogue.

I'm not sure your conclusion follows from your premise, but only by manner of degree. I think supporting, using, trading bitcoin makes one a small-L (or classical) liberal. In so far as ancaps are a subset of classical liberals, you have a point, but there are also a huge number of classical liberals that are not anarcho-capitalists. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:39:13
No doubt.
