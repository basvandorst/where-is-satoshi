I fully believe that Bitcoin in on the path to becoming a long-term store of value, competing more with gold.  But I'm skeptical about price upside from the upcoming Halvening.
Bitcoin trading volumes are already much larger than the volume of new Bitcoin from mining, so my understanding is that most trades aren't generated from sales of recently-mined Bitcoin.  The "supply" of Bitcoin is really a much larger pool of already-mined Bitcoin at play (around 15M Bitcoin accounting for Bitcoin that have probably been lost forever), not just the small influx from mining.
If this is the case, why does it really matter to the Bitcoin supply/demand dynamic that the volume of new Bitcoin from mining will go down by half soon?

You're right, wasn't intended as a US centric thing.  Probably many similar challenges worldwide, and maybe this could be a broader catalyst.

Aha, that makes sense, thanks!

How does the "pump" part of "pump and dump" for Bitcoin actually work?  Can someone with substantial Bitcoin and/or fiat holdings really manipulate the price of Bitcoin up in a consistent way to sell higher than they bought?
I see how this kind of market manipulation can work in the Bluestar Airlines sense (see the 1987 movie Wallstreet) by creating artificial hype for a previously unhyped asset, but the buzz around Bitcoin is already substantial and volatile, so pumping Bitcoin by hyping the asset seems unlikely/unreliable at this point.
