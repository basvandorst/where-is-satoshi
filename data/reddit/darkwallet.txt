Libbitcoin, available here: 
Additionally you can use the SX command line tools on top of it.
There are many services and tools using it already :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:48:03
This is more about financial privacy than it is about money laundering 
Libbitcoin supports whatever you want it to do.

Thanks for your good wishes. We don't expect anyone to end up in prison due to this, but with these governments you never know... time will tell.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:40:14
It is possible. We will make a tutorial on how to set it up in any virtual machine.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:44:08
It is a easy to use bitcoin wallet with additional features focused in security and privacy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:32:19
By the way, in case you are interested, libbitcoin, our bitcoin C++ core implementation, is slowly making it to the debian repo. Electrum should be there soon as well.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:08:47
Zerocoin is cool, but it doesn't exist for now. Dark Wallet is designed to use the normal Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:06:14
We know that any full node will become a pain to run. Initially they will have to be run on donations, just like Electrum servers do now. But we are aware of the problem (see [this answer](

Check the video. We got an amazing venue hosting us:

No. Zerocoin is enough.

Hi! We love Debian and we would love to have it in the repo in the future. For now we are quite busy developing the wallet, maybe in the future when we have time we'll try to have it out there.
Addresses beginning with 3 are multisig addresses and part of the bitcoin standard. We didn't make anything up. Multisig addresses is one of many new features that will be available for the masses for the first time in a bitcoin client when we release this!
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:24:20
Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:49:05
Sooner or later there will be a Dark Wallet in Android, either from us or from someone else. We are definitely capable of doing it, as long as we still have funding left! But for now we are only capable of focusing on the desktop version and can't promise anything on the mobile front.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:36:25
We are giving away the tools so the people can run their own servers very easily. It's important to have a good starting point. In the future we'll investigate SPV or mixing the history from multiple servers.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:22:56


Yay! Glad to see people doing cool stuff!
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:11:06
Contributing to the decentralization of the network!

Libbitcoin, SX and Obelisk are the core for this and are already out there. We are not going to release a wallet that hasn't been strictly tested before everyone and their mother downloads it. Also this is not just another bitcoin wallet, we are introducing many features never seen before in a wallet. Trustless mixing, Multisignature transactions, multiple identities... you will be able to add contacts with their master public key and automatically generate an address every time you send BTC to them... and lots more to come...
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:09:13
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:27:34
Trustless mixing. You can read this: 
Also a redditor did a [cool explanation](
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:53:42
Not technically possible. If someone gets your keys there is no way you can enforce that delay.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:29:20
The funds from Indiegogo haven't been released yet, so no idea. Shouldn't take long. We are in charge of software development and have someone else handling all the perks for the backers. We also hope to have our shirts soon!
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:18:07
Hi. We use a completely different model than the one found in the Satoshi client. Similar to what Electrum does now, but with a different Blockchain server infrastructure capable of handling several thousands of clients per each full node, load balancing between servers, etc. The code and the documentation is available on 
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:06:02
we are here to discuss the dark wallet, not what it *could be* in someone's mind. not wasting more time in this debate, our software speaks for us.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:25:51
There will be "Dark Wallet Certified" bitcoin clients. Hive will probably be the first one. Anyway the dark wallet is an actual client sitting in your computer, you just use the browser to talk to it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:11:40
No. It is quite new and we already have our own well-tested c++ implementation. Read more at 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:55:32
Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:54:11
You don't have to agree with any particular ideology in order to use our software. It will be free to use for everyone and the souce code will be available so people can determine wether they take it seriously or not. We take it very seriously, and that is also part of our ideology.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:33:47
this guy knows the deal.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:59:02
Yes. Trustless mixing will use multisig and you will be able to construct multisig transactions from a user-friendly GUI!
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:42:15
Yes. There will be no noticeable sync time at all. Dark Wallet uses the Obelisk Blockchain server, that can be run by anyone and is built for massive concurrency and scalability. Not a single line of code by Satoshi or Gavin Andresen, this is next-gen software ready for the "next billion" of bitcoin users. We are getting a yummy server with an SSD to store the blockchain with the crowfunding money, and it will be ready to handle requests from every Dark Wallet out there since day one. We expect other people to run their own Obelisk Servers as well, and we strongly recommend storing the blockchain on an SSD to anyone intending to do so. No seek time = wallets syncing instantly.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:26:17
we'll respect the network consensus.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:51:08
Yes! There are 10 left! Just pick the Dark Wallet Pack II option.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:29:45
For those of you demanding a more thoughtful answer:
About the critical consensus part of the code, that's not a big problem for us, since we're using c++ and the code can be factored into a smaller library. We had a talk with Peter Todd about this in the meeting. This might be trickier for other implementations, and would mean a bigger compromise since they may be running as pure interpreted code.
About nobody mining with it, it's just reaching production and eligius pool is already working on adding support for mining on it. Once the tools are ready we think more miners will be interested. This crowdfunding also helps in making that go faster, but our main goal is a light wallet here.
Also the discussion assumes less implementations is better, while it might not be so as in the case mentions, or relating certain kinds of co-option or attacks. The case is probably different implementations are going to succeed in getting a sizable share, and the best interest for all is to make various great implementations plus standardizing the protocol.
If I were the US Government and had co-opted the core team, I would be happy in them being the only implementation since then I could just change it at any appropriate time. But I would also rather co-opt the miners since they hold the real power.
In the end, the arguments for centralization like those in this critique, only hold for some, so expect alternative implementations thriving, specially in the face of a seriously underfunded bitcoin development space. The main implementation is lagging and a lot of other devs are also working on their own resources, like, say, colored coin development.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:02:48
Like, which kind of harm?
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:45:30
We are releasing the code for everyone. Feel free to fork it for your favorite altcoin or whatever.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:46:57
Not at the moment. We have ideas floating around, things that can be done. We'll look into it after finishing the wallet.
About the second question, that is beyond our scope for now. We wish we could do something about it, but...
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:21:37
It should run in Tails, but we don't know if it will make it to the distro. Our wallet is 100% electrum compatible, so yes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:25:50
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:12:20
Thanks for the support!!
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:06:16
Same system as Electrum, same advantages and disadvantages. Good ol' seed on a piece of paper.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:18:26


We are presenting this strictly as a software project. People is funding this software project and nothing else with their money. We will not use this budget to promote any agenda.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:46:56


wat? are they suggesting this is just a part of a plan from the US gov? lol
miners aren't stupid, they will reject anything threatening bitcoin as we know it. We aren't trying to get miners to do anything. Our code is intended for anyone using bitcoin. The miners can do whatever they want. Only thing that worries me is that lots of miners now are part of mining corporations and don't control their mining software/hardware. I guess people like asicminer shareholders can have input on that, but I actually have no idea.
btw, in case anyone is interested, we recommend Luke-Jr's Eligius mining pool.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:30:02
it will definitely have more "never seen before" stuff apart from multisig.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:53:50
Hi, this is open source software and we are not a company. It will be independently audited by every member of the community willing to do so, so you can be safe. The code will be having many eyes on it!!
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:01:39
You can read [Vitalik's answer]( above.
TL;DR: More implementations is better for the network. Dark wallet is not miner software. We are not forking the protocol/blockchain here in any way.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:01:45
Apple has a large stake in the payments game, and they fear bitcoin. If you want to be certain of your ability to use bitcoin in your mobile device, just don't use iOS.
