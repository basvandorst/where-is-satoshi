GM is in no way a scam. They arent paying me "what you could already own" I gave them a set price in Bitcoin for them to run antminers for me and I get all the profit from it minus fees to keep it running. If I tried to run antminers myself it would be impossible because where I live electricty is much higher and I dont have the room to run and keep cool all those antminers. 
GM wont cancel my contract for no reason. The contract states it will continue to run as long as it is profitable. They have a set daily fee they charge me and as long as it brings in more than it cost it stays running.
I have done massive amounts of research and GM is 100% legit and I know for a fact they wont just "run away" with my money one day.

There are 0% promotion cards. The 0% usually last for a year to 18 months then any balance not paid off converts to whatever the cards normal % is.

if its not dying and just "normalizing" at some point it would most likely hit 20k again, The DOW hit 20, which people thought wouldnt happen. If it truly is "going mainstream" it will hit 20k again, but at a normal pace not a super mania pace.

Ok, clearly you did not watch the video I posted. I will easily, EASILY own 1 Bitcoin from this contract in one year. The contract has been running for less than two weeks and I already have .1 Bitcoin mined. Also .28 per TH is actually not a bad fee at all, the electricty fee from running my ethereum rig at home comes to 39% which is higher. Bitcoin contracts with GM are extremely profitable right now, if you dont believe me watch the video series, youll see how wrong you are.

If America goes down, so does everyone else. We've had a global economy for sometime now. It should be everyones hope it doesnt go down.

Just looked at that site, looks incredibly scammy. Genesis Mining is the only cloud mining service I trust. All the people running the company are publicly known, they dont hide identities. They take video and picture inside their actual mining facilities and they have had prominate Youtubers go and film inside the facilities.
The case study is to see if I can earn the 1.69 Bitcoin from mining.

The rates on Bitcoin mining are much better at Genesis Mining. Their the only cloud mining company I trust. If wait for their Bitcoin contracts to come back then go with them. If you check my history you can find a link to a GM Bitcoin case study I'm doing.

You just ned to learn impulse control. Ive had 3 0% APR cards back to back and have used them as interest free loans to buy Bitcoin. Paying off the last one in November before interest starts kicking in in January.

interesting, never heard of Revolut, thanks!

Cant tell if you're being sarcastic or not, but if not, thank you!

Ive posted here before about it and people seem to like the ongoing case study, sorry youre not a fan.

How is ether a scam?
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:49:08
Thanks. I know I could have bought 1.69 Bitcoin at the time and I was just planning on HODLing it. So as long as I am able to mine 1.69 Bitcoin from this lifetime contract than it would be a better investment, at least thats what Im thinking.

Of 2050?
