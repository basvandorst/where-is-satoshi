One question I'd like him to answer is did he honestly expect classical communist propoganda tactics to work on creating ChinaShitCoin with the help of a logically inept Roger?

Same as the one over in Tukwila.  Rate is anywhere from 10% over spot on a good day to 15% on average.  Using any other method is practically better than using this kiosk

What kind of half assed logic is that?

Looks like dip sh*t miners and r/BTC people are getting pretty aggressive with their agenda

I wish there was a way to differentiate miners who have chosen to change which chain to mine on to be locked out of getting any form of block reward/transaction fees for a significant number of blocks (like say 300 it 600).  While leaving new nodes/miners to join and remain unaffected.  Though this probably will never happen or be difficult to definitively proof the miners history without a unique identifier.

Putting my tin foil hat on.  I seriously forking and forcing newer alt coins is the direction those attempting to hijack BTC will take as it creates money out of literally nothing.
It clearly is affecting transactions now.  Whether it continues to do so (I don't think it will) remains to be seen.  But I do think that if miners go to a different chain they should be very well prepared to forgo profits from switching on this chain if they engage in this type of behavior.  With the next fork and instability that will ensue I'm going to make the assumption that large mining pools behavior/disruption to this chain will largely not change.
The alt chain can set up whatever it wants but if they abandon this chain, be prepared to put your money where your mouth is.  A 1 or 1/2 day lockout period isn't serious enough

You are correct that there will always be problems in the protocol and as such be exploited.  Every software program has these issues.  But you know what happens when software companies find these types of bugs that pose security issues or significant stability issues?
They fix them.  Trying to make the argument that it will recentralize in some other form is likely correct, that will happen if there is economic incentive to do so by a person's/state with large resources that wants to exploit.  The downside to that is that they must invest.
The only way to fix this WHEN this becomes a problem is to either introduce a "patch"/code alteration, new program or alter existing processing methods.  This ultimately results in punitive damages to any party that engages in this behavior.  Is it warranted?  If it's becoming a major stability or security issue, absolutely.  No programmer in their right mind would allow for such a gross problem to exist if they can fix it unless there was an ulterior motive involved.
Favoritism does exist and will continue to but so long as they play by the general rules , there isn't an issue.  In this case there is.  Arguing there isn't and it will resolve itself is by definition moot.  People will not change their behavior if there is no incentive not too, in this case harmful exploitation

Again I have to reiterate my point if some sort of software update isn't enabled to fix this (whether it's segwit or some other change within Bitcoin). Then there really isn't any choice to change the pow unless continued use of this exploit is "ok".
Really anyone that argues that this isn't an issue must acknowledge that changing the pow isn't the only option but if there's exceedingly heavy resistance towards the other option then (especially when it's a general net win for most non asic boost users resulting in more fees/money for the miners with respect to the current protocol) is incredibly troubling.
Thus if the miners won't agree on something then I totally think the developers should.  Yes it would be somewhat detrimental to miners that use asics but for the long term growth of Bitcoin if at least one of these two options is not chosen then we're left with the stifling antics of what's going on now, which is not acceptable on any logical level if the best interest in Bitcoin is making it such that no group of miners has a grossly unfair advantage.
Learning from this, anytime a particular mining group acts odd, as with antpool and it's subsidies on mining empty blocks or some other strange behavior out of the norm, special scrutiny should be applied to their equipment or soft patches to existing bugs should be fixed.  If there's heavy resistance again, then guess what, you found another cheat

Except for when it makes publications against himself, much like the "fake news" media.
I swear Trump literally is the most corrupt candidate for president we've had in recent history.
