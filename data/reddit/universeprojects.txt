Well they will be surprised then. &gt;:)
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:03:31
We're using Moolah for payment processing.
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:12:26
We are going to be using Moolah as our payment processor and will therefore be accepting all currencies that they support. At the time of writing, that would mean:
* Bitcoin
* Dogecoin
* Litecoin
* Vertcoin
* Quarkcoin
* Auroracoin
* Darkcoin
* Maxcoin
* Mintcoin
The game itself already allows players to create their own currencies through the invention system, but they will be run-of-the-mill in-game virtual currencies (like gold in diablo/WoW).

This is a newsletter update, but if you're just interested in the answer to the question in the title, here is a direct link to the blog entry: 
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:58:14
We'll be implementing 2 factor signins similar to how Diablo 3 worked when you had real-money transactions involved.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:53:00
There will be player-made currencies in-game. They will be created through the invention system just like any other item in the game. The disadvantage of this is the confusion and need for exchange. However, this is the nature of a Universe Project, the whole project must be as organic as possible or it can't be called a Universe Project. 
I wont need to balance the game economy, the players will. If a new invention is created that changes the balance of power, then it will be sought after until someone makes something better. Who balances the economy in the real world?
Purple. :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:30:04
Yep, really.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:45:09
That doesn't appear to be the case in my experience, but I'm no trader.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:58:18
We will be accepting BC, yes!
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:04:22
It's not cancelled, it has just launched.
You'll find the reference to the other coins we will support in the much more extensive description on the Kickstarter.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:59:28
Give me a PM! There is lots to do!
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:55:28
I'm in Canada, the laws here are a bit different, but I'll still have to jump through hoops, yes. I'm hoping to team up with an exchange to make this transition easier once things start picking up.
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:21:16
Check out the "Our Philosophy" section of the Kickstarter. It might help explain what we're trying to do with a bit more clarity.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:45:44
No it's still valid. They helped to lessen the blow. If there were no alts, the only choice would be for people to dump BTC/USD. Because they did have a choice, BTC/USD didn't take as hard of a hit, and BTC/USD is the industry standard for value, it is what everyone looks at.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:57:50
The list of supported coins are based on Moolah the payment processor.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:52:47
You caught that did you ;)
We will, after the Kickstarter.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:41:57
The issues in recent memory:
 - The MT.Gox craziness
 - China banning crypto currencies
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:52:20
YES. The prototype should work on it now as the best browser for the game is currently Chrome.
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:38:53
First and _only_ project. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:30:39
We will be accepting all of our supported cryptocurrencies after the Kickstarter. THe reason for this is that Kickstarter gives us (and crypto currency in general) some big exposure if it succeeds and it is important to funnel as much traffic to it as possible.
Same can be said for Steam Greenlight. I'm hoping we can hit the top spot on the next batch of greenlights!
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:45:34
In a roundabout way, yes. Dogecoin primarily - exchange to BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:04:23
Yes but I'm more concerned about the legal ramifications of claiming that I am supporting the processing and holding of a currency rather than a "virtual made-up money". It is within the realm of possibilities we may have to rename it to keep users from needing to enter a long signup process if they wish to use it.
Its just conjecture at this point.
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:01:08
I imagine the same thing, except I see villages in remote parts of Africa getting their free tablet shipment (I'm referring to an experiment that happened recently) and being able to make real money by playing VoidSpace after they've learned to read and write. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:49:57
We will accept all coins Moolah accepts.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:04:55
It is quite a bit more complicated than that. The problem is synchronization.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:11:15
Peter Molyneux has a monolply on science based dragons these days. I'm afraid we couldn't afford it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:26:18
Check out the graph on this image, it shows how quickly we're gaining momentum out of all the other applications thanks to your support!
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:56:23
Or Bitcoin. :) We will accept Bitcoin as well as a slew of other altcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:57:16
We will likely have some form of public API yes. We already have this for certain things internally, it would just be about giving public access.
Any chance we can get a mention on some of your bigger sites? :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:55:56
It could happen in one locality. The game world will be vast and there is no way one group could control it all. You might get a Star Wars situation where one group, or group of groups controls the biggest and most civilized section while the rest live on the outskirts.
Rebels vs Empire?
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:50:49
It's not something to get angry about, it's a vital component of the system. When Bitcoin crashes, where do the funds go? To USD? I sure hope not. I'd rather they stay in some crypto currency somewhere. It's still easier to transfer between cryptos than it is to transfer to FIAT, so with that in mind, it is a benefit to have multiple cryptos.
I'll put it more plainly. When something happens (like MT.Gox), what do people do? They want to dump (even if they have nothing to do with MT.Gox because the price of BTC/USD is dropping. However, if they dump to another crypto, the BTC/USD price doesn't take as much of a hit (fewer people selling), and BTC remains to appear more valuable. 
Edit: The real-money currency will be Dogecoin yes, but we're accepting multiple currencies for automatic exchange - including Bitcoin and many others.

Now, to answer your question. We failed to reach critical mass with media exposure mostly because I'm a terrible publicist. However this doesn't mean that I can't learn how to do it properly and I've learned a lot since the kickstarter. If you look at the project alone without looking at its media success, it's clear that it could very easily be a winner. The concept is incredibly tantalizing and sparks a lot of interest with people. And this isn't just a subjective opinion, it can easily be proven with an audit of the statistics we've have and the comments we've gotten. I have some plans for how I'm going to change the way the project is presented going forward. If you're interested in how I plan on doing it, do a Google search on the Golden Circle with how why and what. Our 'why' is particularly compelling but I have avoided using it can come off as too 'pie in the sky' if it is not presented right.
For the second part of your question, yes it will be difficult until we get funding, but the prototype is now strong enough it should not be a problem. At this point it's only about getting the exposure we need and getting it in front of the people that matter.
Now for the comment that I missed about a month ago, we do need programmers and we have something called the open development program that allows developers to contribute to the project in an open source environment. If you're interested in taking part in that I'll be happy to get you set up! The work is mostly Java related, but it would be using Java in ways that you probably never seen before.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:46:09
Except you can kill the manipulators :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:57:10
I may actually have to not use the Dogecoin name for legal reasons, but I'm hoping that is not the case.
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:34:24
We will also be accepting Bitcoin (among other smaller currencies) as well!
**I'll answer any questions that you might have, so lets make this an AMA.**
Edit: [Kickstarter is live now if you're interested in early access](
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:29:38
Lets hear it!
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:48:49
P2W is for games where power can be bought from the game company. VoidSpace is strictly about buying from other players (like every other MMO in existence, even the ones that don't specifically support RMT). Allowing RMT will make it safer for players.
VoidSpace in particular is different because there is no global auction house. Even if you wanted to dump tonnes of money into the game, you still have to find players to buy from and the goods need to exist in the first place.
Some are concerned about "creating an imbalance in the world". But imbalances will literally be everywhere in a truly organic game like this. 
* Someone might have an online following (imagine if Notch decided to play and start a group). 
* Someone might have been playing for a lot longer than you.
* And yes, Player B might have bought all the goods from Player A and and thus the power shifts from Player A to Player B in the world. But it doesn't matter that much for you. 
Keep in mind that you can always distance yourself in the world. Find a remote part of the game world that is untouched to start your group. It might take an entire day before you reach the next settlement. If you don't want to be part of the crazy, that's always an option.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:58:38
It's not the same as eve at all.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:45:21
I will!
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:59:28
The economy has never been our defining asset, imo.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:50:25
Check out TideSDK. We haven't had the chance to verify that it is the solution we need, but it is a candidate.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:51:05
Yep, fire away narmstrong at universeprojects dot com
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:15:10
I wasn't talking about technical issues.
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:51:26
We will accept the following crypto currencies (so far):
* Bitcoin  &lt;--
* Dogecoin
* Litecoin
* Vertcoin
* Quarkcoin
* Auroracoin
* Darkcoin
* Maxcoin
* Mintcoin
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:01:59

Not all of those things are hard, and the ones that are...
If its not hard, its not worth doing.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:00:28
I don't have time to go into detail, there is a lot to cover. But I do talk about a lot of this stuff here and there on our various platforms and social sites and articles.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:01:08
I will say that if you think it's impossible, it's probably because you don't quite know what we're trying to do.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:53:34
Your character has to be the wallet, and you can play the same character on any device at any time. Client side wallets wouldn't work.
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:53:08
Ah sorry for missing your comment! Ill have to get back to you as I'm just heading out right now!
