Well, for one thing, it allows governments to more effectively tax wealth as opposed to income.  That may not be popular on here, but it's politically popular.  Fiat also allows for more effective management of the domestic economy, and isolation from supranational impacts.

Bitcoin was designed as a currency that uses a distributed consensus network (it's not really trustless, you still have to trust that the majority of the network is not malevolent in a concerted way), not the other way around.  This is quite apparent from Satoshi's conversations on the cryptography listserv.

The collapse of Mt. Gox is significant in the Bitcoin community, and a considerable outlier, in the way Madoff was significant in the investment world.  Madoff got considerably more airtime than Mt. Gox, but if your standard is going to be 'Madoff sized scam" then, by logical extension, you think Bitcoin simply doesn't belong in the news at all, since the entire collapse would be, at most, $9 Billion.

Not really, if you're using Tor, that will be encrypted between you and the exit node, but the whole point of bitcoin is that it's a peer-2-peer network, and encryption beyond the exit node would cause a lot of problems with that.  I wouldn't really worry about it too much if you're using Tor, I like to remind people that Tor isn't perfect because people should always be careful, but it's actually pretty effective.  The US Government just happens to be ridiculously good at breaking these types of things (specifically the NSA), but it takes a lot of work, so as long as you aren't doing anything crazy, they're not going to use it to try to find you.  I don't know how familiar you are with Tor, but if you want to help make the government's job a little harder and you're not already, consider operating a [relay](
Edit: Now that I think about it, there used to be node on the bitcoin network that was accessible exclusively over Tor, so that would probably be the closest, but I don't remember any of the details of it.

You're not paying attention and your talking past my point.  If you include the recommended tx fee of .0001, it will cost you 1/10 of your millibit to transact.  That's objectively true.

Some of the legal protections do, the preventative ones do not.  Take Havelock investments, they operate what clearly falls under the definition of an exchange under Panamanian law, and yet they are not registered as one.  The protections that would normally accrue under that structure aren't there, because they are subverting it.

That's a unique view, you feel the fed has been too tight on money?  
I'm not sure how the Fed "Put[s] the whole society into debt," is it because they control interest rates?  Congress was perfectly capable of doing that long before the fed existed, by either printing more money to buy back debt itself, or printing more debt to get back money.  The Fed didn't bring that power into existence, it's always existed.

I would imagine their margins are slightly higher for bitcoin than for, say, their normal credit card purchases.  Credit cards charge between 1-2% on transactions, and they also have to eat chargebacks.

Inherently is now "wishywashy"?  I'm pretty sure inherently is a pretty clear term.  You use the term deflationary incorrectly, and I'm pointing it out, "inflationary" and "deflationary" describe a characteristic between two discrete points in time, not an immutable characteristic.  Saying bitcoin is deflationary, with nothing more, is inaccurate.  If adoption and velocity were held constant, and permanent loss eliminated, bitcoin would inflate in value, not deflate.  


Actually, essentially all stores of value are non-inherently deflationary.  


No, to call it that is inaccurate, which is my point.  Describing bitcoin as a "deflationary asset" is misleading at best.  
It is not tautological, because not all things that are declared legal tender become fiat money as a result.  


No, they're not the same, I'm glad you realize that, so why did you claim it was tautological?


That's correct, good thing I didn't claim declaring gold legal tender would make it fiat.  


That's patently false, if the US Government printed $10mm in fiat currency, and then declared from that point on it would print no more, that currency would still be fiat.  


No it isn't.  Bitcoin has no material use outside of it's use as a medium of exchange and a store of value.

You own the security, "street name" is so the issuer knows how to route communications, and knows what party it's dealing with directly, this is in some ways similar to how exchanges used pooled accounts.  You have to consent to allowing the brokerage to borrow your security for short-sale transactions, and that consent comes at a price.  Firms that require your consent as a term of doing business are generally cheaper than the ones that don't, and firms that make it optional provide an incentive.  This is no different from what Bitfinex does when you allow them to loan out your BTC in exchange for interest.

Gross global wealth is the increase in productive value of the world over the course of a year.  Gross global wealth is around $200 trillion according to [the Atlantic]( but even that's a bad measure, because there isn't 1 unit of currency for every equivalent amount of value.  There is no maximum value, if bitcoins replaced all the worlds currency, their value would still depend on the demand for an exchange intermediary and the velocity of money, in addition to several other factors.

Bitcoin solves the issue of trust about as much as physical dollars do, all it allows is greater trust in a more mobile transfer medium.  Which is great, and something we certainly need, but it's not a cure-all and you shouldn't pretend it is, you'll hurt what it already is.

Bitcoin is not inherently deflationary.  It is deflationary to the extent that adoption increase, velocity increase, and permanent loss rate outpace supply generation, but nothing inherently requires that the balance weigh on the side of the former.  
And ultimately that's irrelevant to whether something is or isn't fiat.  A government absolutely could declare bitcoin as legal tender, giving it fiat status.  Nothing about bitcoin makes this impossible, or even more difficult than with your "Mastercoin."  Pick up a dictionary before you use a word.

They have absolutely no licenses in Panama, I've inquired with the financial regulators.  Quoting their own page is retarded.  The Panama Fund, S.A. is registered, but registration means only that they've notified one regulator that they exist and intend to act as a Private Investment Fund, something that fund did in 2008, and other than this "acquisition," they've had no other activity since registration.  They do not have a license to operate an exchange in Panama, despite operating one.

This article is also fairly inaccurate.  


It's absolutely under government control.  Not only is it subject to whatever regulations are duly enacted by the legislative and executive, its Board of Governors is composed entirely of political appointees of the executive and confirmed by the upper house of the legislature.  
More importantly, this article seems to suggest JPM would like bitcoin.  The Federal Reserve system, as the article states, was created as a buffer to the easy-money tendencies of the legislature.  The whole point of bitcoin is that it has a hard limit on easy-money.

This is purely against your claim about waiting for a confirmation.  A tx fee does not protect you against a double spend attack.  If I have a better connection map to the majority of nodes than you do, and I have another connection to you or a node right near you, I can effectively execute a double-spend attack against you, and I'll win most of the time.  Nobody's going to do this over a 20mBTC transaction, but they may well do it for 2BTC one.
