It's OFF

Again with this "intrinsic" value nonsense. There is no such thing. Value is depends on whether there's a demand for that thing. You can mention gold, oil, shares, FIAT etc. If no other person is interested in it tomorrow. Then it becomes useless. The only question is how confident are you that whatever asset you hold will be in demand for longer than you want to hold it. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:58:24
That is the issue here!
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:58:53
I think the term "experts" should not be used for such people. Speculators, Paid opinions, Market manipulators etc would do it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:17:54
Funny enough. He just described bitcoin when saying "represent human trust and cooperation". Unlike with FIAT, no law forces anyone to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:09:25
This sound more like it. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:00:51
It depends  on how many follow after you.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:00:32
I feel you.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:09:01
I'm glad I'm not the only one.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:27:49
Financially it's not different. But systemically it means bitcoin is pushing through. Next time he has an opportunity to do this with any other person, he knows where to click.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:31
No, just venting my frustration. I don't go anywhere close to them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:25
Was feeling guilty to have bought at USD17000. You post makes me feel better. So two weeks it is.
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:18:24
I saw this. My fingers were too slow in grabbing a screenshot.
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:06:04
That's not disagreement. It's false representation. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:54:09
Your money just moves back and forth. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:57:25
Same here. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:59:58
What a useless altcoin. Maybe it'll get a hardfork one day.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:29:05
hahaaha, Kim is kind cool now.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:02:28
The good news is that the hash rate has gone up to 68% for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:25:08
Even if your assumed prediction turns out true, how do we know you are not working on some insider information and shielding yourself with "technical analysis"?
I have a better challenge. Let me send you a graph of any  random stock or crypto from history. Then using your technical analysis tell us what happened. After that I will post the rest of the graph and which one it is for everyone to verify. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:44:05
Just a multiplier to have a round figure like $1000,000 for reference. Hence he/she multiplied both $ and BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:26:14
Many Countries use the USD as a store of value. Does that make it a stock?
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:47:48
My thoughts exactly. After this they'll pretend they have some magic knowledge if bitcoin's future so they can get money out of gullible investors. We are watching them.
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:41:05
Sounds like e blockchain prophecy 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:49:42
This seems to happen way to often.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:05:10
Funny enough that's how I pronounced his name until I heard the proper pronunciation.
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:08:13
Great job alerting some of us who had no idea this was going on. Whether miners are right, wrong or making a logical decision is a secondary matter. It's good to have people who share such news to some of us. great job.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:11:02
Kudoz! I wonder when I'll get to post this.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:12:11
The easiest job ever.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:35:54
I like how they both understand.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:49:42
This seems to happen way to often.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:01:30
You literally read my mind. With only difference being coinbase. In addition I go on twitter, search  and scheme through as many tweets as I can.
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:00:20
I agree. These answers were wonderful and made simple enough for ordinary individuals. Who's this guy?
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:15:30
Oh! The timing. Just perfect. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:33:31
Can Someone who understands explain. This is an interesting question.
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:32:39
Right or Not, I have been noticing the trend in this "blockchain not Bitcoin" nonsense. It's about time someone questioned what they are really saying.
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:12:18
I put 50% of my income in BTC. It's better than leaving it in a bank account. I'll take that risk. Too bad I may not get to a full bitcoin anytime soon. My logic is, I would rather lose money to a mathematically proven system than to the recklessness of some no names I can never confront.
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:41:54
True. But every criminal has their target range and the twins have serious security. So protect yourself from criminals targeting your level of wealth.

It seems I was born a day late then.

Centralised decentralisation.

It works here in South Africa too.
