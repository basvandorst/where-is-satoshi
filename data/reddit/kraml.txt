Read here how soft forks are a funny way of tricking old nodes in thinking they are validating blocks correctly while in fact they are not:
Old nodes can arrive at wrong conclusions at be none the wiser. With hard forks, at least they know they need to upgrade.

At least it gives everyone a chance to enter the mining business and mix things up without permission. Also, it will be hard for miners to censor a transaction (it would be mined by a different miner at some point) or double spend if people wait for an appropriate amount of confirmations. The sidechain functionaries could do any of that easily.

They should only steer technical decisions. The blocksize stalling is most definitively not a technical decision, but an economic/political one. Upgrading to 2mb or 5mb is certainly possible, technically speaking.
After that, the market can decide what soft limits to put in place, like before, when we had a ~700kb which was lifted by most miners when it was not sufficient anymore.

Even disregarding anything you say, the original point still stands: if some people want to accept zero conf transcations and it gives them a net gain, why make that impossible for them? Many businesses have gained a big user base solely on relying on zero conf (SatoshiDice would have never made it big without them).


Who said anything about zero fees? The issue is about zero conf and the risks associated with it, which is orthogonal to the issue of the size of the fees.


Payment what? I am a dev, and building a service that handles zero conf bitcoin transactions is trivial to me. Implementing payment channels and whatnot would take me way more research and implementation time. Any friction is bad for businesses starting up.
User friction is even worse: can I use my MyCelium and Electrum wallets to place a bet at a gambling site that runs on payment channels? I don't think I ever paid anything over any payment channel yet.


Let's talk about this once they are here and established. Until then, we still need to use what we have.
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:08:49
I like what he writes, but this always struck me as wrong:


the default **in case of controversy is no change.**
Seeing that if Satoshi had put, say, 2mb back then instead of 1mb, we would not have a huge debate on whether to lower the limit to 1mb. There is always controversy, but doing nothing has an unfair bias, and in this case, doing nothing is not sticking to status quo, but changing status quo.

You're right, bitcoin could fail altogether. Barring that, improvement is pretty much guaranteed. Would you say security hasn't improved in the last two years?

I agree the test did not show anything new. However, if Bitcoin usage explodes and blocks are filled up permanently, resulting in an ever increasing backlog, we can still except a crash landing, as described by Mike Hearn. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:48:59
Interpreting that differently is the whole point of the post. By not changing the limit, you induce an ECE, which is also changing the status quo, and changing it more radically than increasing the limit. I suggest you read the post in full.

Not changing the protocol is the default, while it should be equally treated when it comes to decision making. So the consensus model is not working as intended. People do not agree on keeping the current limit, yet it is not being changed.

There are more miners in the world, some of which can feasibly mine larger blocks. No reason to artificially restrict them. Every miner should be able to decide for themselves what their orphan risk is and put their limit accordingly.

This is not a relevant question.

It is two edged. If you have billions of assets sitting in colored coins, the Bitcoin market cap is a multiple of the sum of the value of the underlying Bitcoins.
Worse still is the fact that miners would not be paid proportionately, as they do not get colored coins in turn for securing the colored coins.

For example, the query for the UTXO set completely relies on trust. If you want to verify that a node did not cheat you with the response, validating the set is as difficult as indexing it yourself in the first place (in which case you don't need to query anymore).
It would be nice to keep the core protocol trustless. Stuff like querying the UTXO set can just as well live on a separate layer. One could for example use Electrum servers to query this stuff.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:53:38


That is just wrong. The &gt;50% of mining power are not the only ones involved in the vote. The rest of the miners, and the nodes (and to a lesser extent SPV users) are too.

The proposal amounts to what is effectively a blocksize increase, but deployable via a softfork.
Your comments here always sounded like it wasn't a matter of softfork vs hardfork, but on the disadvantages regarding decentralization. Did this change?
The last slide mentions plans for a hardfork anyway. 
With all the benefits, this proposal is awesome and should be deployed, but this could also be done later. I have to wonder why a hardfork couldn't be done now? With one hardfork only, future blocksize limit changes can also be softforked.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:05:44
This is unrelated to the reason they removed it. You could argue that "bank"-wallets should be removed from the site, or moved into its separate section. 
They should also get rid of circle, xapo etc. by your logic.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:39:35
True. Still, the devs are not the ones that should steer this ship.
They have no definite answer as to which is more beneficial to future decentralization and adoption, as they can't know. No one knows for sure.   
Devs should be there to enable the use of the technology, not make economic decisions. That's what the market players are there for.
If bitcoin fails due to centralisation because of too large blocks, the market will fix it or retry with a better coin.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:31:49
AFAIK they moved to offchain because they used 0 conf transactions before and were cheated. 1 conf is a long wait time, which means less bets per user, which means less profit.

Miners can impose fees and soft block limits. If another miner can offer cheaper fees and users are willing to pay less to wait to get into a block, though luck, that is competition.

Mike is pushing for Bitcoin-XT, which has more patches than just the block limit increase. He (and Gavin) should be releasing a fork with only the blocksize change and nothing else.

It's all the same, assuming the consensus switch happens when a reasonable majority has upgraded and hence voted for that. What a reasonable threshold is is up for debate, but it isn't even debated, the whole thing is treated like pure evil instead.
I also don't appreciate how the core devs think softforks are acceptable and hardfork aren't. Softforks are just a creative way of tricking old nodes into believing they are verifying the blocks correctly, when in fact they are not. Imho all change should be hardforks, and if you activate then after a almost all miners and nodes have upgraded, there is practically no risk.
What the reference client is will hopefully become meaningless in time, when more implementations become available.
Last but not least, I see a lot of reasoning and willingness to compromise on the big blocks camp, but zero willingness to compromise from the core devs. There is a serious disconnect between what many from the industry and mining want, and what core devs do. It's not their place to make economic decisions.
Why not leave it to the market? It will have it's way anyway sooner or later. All this stalling can't last forever.

On the other hand, the opponents have not addressed the serious financial risks users face when the system crashes once it reaches its limit.

Very nice write-up.

For example, Freud is creator of psychoanalysis, but he sure was not right about a lot of things in this field. Today we know better. In the future, we will know better.
Naturally I have high respect for Satoshi, but it would be ridiculous to take his word as truth in all matters. It is a fallacy to argue that if Satoshi said it, it is the best course. Disclaimer: I am for removing the limit, I am just pointing that fallacy.

You ignored all my points about friction and the future tech not being available *now*. I can't wait for bitcoin wallets to mature for ten years before I can build a business that I could build right now based on 0-conf.


Of course not, but they also don't need to actively make it harder than it needs to be. Bitcoin became successful because it was easy enough to get coding. With your attitude, Bitcoin would not have been released so early, and it would have been released in a way more complex form, because fuck it, no need to coddle the devs out there. If you don't make it easy for them, they won't build the ecosystem you also need. It has nothing to do with coddling.

Rusty's argument is that the orphan rate will increase. Miners can estimate their orphan rate risk and put their own limit accordingly. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:46:54
I think you are misinformed. You can turn softfork in a decrease of block size limits after an initial increase via hardfork. Once a lower limit has been soft-forked in, it is the new rule and the miners have to follow it.

To be fair, that's only correlation, not causation. Also, after the halving, the price didn't do anything for a couple of months. Why would it? People have seen it coming and priced it in.

You have to trust a node to give you the correct utxo set. Verifying it is the same work as constructing it yourself in the first place. So it is quite pointless putting this into the protocol. You can have traditional servers do the same with the same level of trust.

Only because the limit is raised it doesn't mean every miner has to fill them up. If they want to lower their orphan risk, they can set a lower soft limit.

At least one of those patches is controversial (query utxo). If Mike is going to release a fork with the 20mb limit, he should release a version with only that change, leaving out the other changes. 
It feels a bit like a sneaky way of spreading the other patches by riding on the popularity of the higher limit. 
what's your opinion? 
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:28:23
Hypothetically, if most miners were to go on strike right after a difficulty adjustment, the time between blocks would increase dramatically, because the hash rate would drop, whereas the difficulty would not be adjusted for another 2016 blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:47:35
I think this is different in that you should usually not accept zero conf transactions that depend on other unconfirmed transactions. Even today, you could invalidate the followup transaction by exploiting the malleability issue (unless that issue has since been solved, I haven't kept up to date).

You cannot even compare it to email, as the 30 days is the time the message is being kept in the network. This is better than email, because if you send an email and the mail server is down, it will never arrive.

You have to decide if you want to be an early adopter, suffering the inconveniences that are yet to be eliminated, or wait until the mainstream has adopted it and you can use it just as easily (or more easily) than fiat.

I expect the government will try to get involved (they already are, bitlicense), but they can't prevent me from being my own bank, and that's what matters to me.
Why does the government have to be the entity in control? The free market will create bank like institutions for bitcoin (we are already seeing the beginning of it), and competition will make sure that the insecure ones will be weeded out. 
We are already converging on very secure wallets where the company providing the service has no control over the keys. Example: multisig with greenaddress. 
See the progress made in security in the last year alone, extrapolate that, and you'll see a system with unprecedented security, while still being resistant to the whims of banks and governments. Conventional banks had a lot more time to harden their security, and bitcoin is catching up fast.

Miners also collect all the transaction fees (usually about ~0.0001 BTC per transaction at the moment). The less new Bitcoins are created (and eventually none), the more the miners will receive in transaction fees, due to increased adoption, or possibly (though unlikely IMO) due to higher transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:45:36
Because the other do not depend on economic/scientific growth. Mining is self-calibrating, the absolute value of the hash rate is irrelevant. It is only relevant how the hash rate is distributed and whether some entity can have more than 50%.

Edit: I have read almost everything written on the topic from both sides, and don't get me wrong, I have immense respect for the core devs, as well as for Gavin. I do not think the core devs do not want Bitcoin to scale.
Not a troll, I swear :)
For the longest time, the core dev's issue with increasing was first and foremost centralization issues, not hardfork problems. If centralization was not an issue, I am pretty sure the community could pull of a hardfork without too much trouble.
So a compromise could have been raising the limit to any number above 1mb, like 2mb, 8mb, the 2-4-8 bip, or whatever. But they did not bulge.
Why not? I have no idea, but if I woud wager a guess, it is not much more than a power game and they don't want non-core devs winning an argument or influencing the direction in this way. Big characters would admit that they either have been wrong or compromise would be beneficial for the community to remain united.

First of all, I was not the one to bring up two independent internet networks, so I did not want to get hung up on it. Second of all:


Is obviously unrealistic, as links between the two networks would be built in tandem of the two networks being developed, so the networks would be able to share information. 


The topic is multiple blockchains. I don't particularly care for the internet analogy, as it is not a perfect analogy.




If it is reliable, then having one is preferable. Bitcoin is still too young to know whether it will continue to be reliable in the future. Since achieving a secure blockchain is hard, and we already got the second one, and you never know if it might turn out to be useful, I don't see the need to hate on it.

@_date: 2015-01-27 18:28:56
You are incorrect. There is no microtime or any other time saved in a transaction. It also does not matter which one was created first. The only thing that matters is that one block cannot contain both transactions. Miners will most likely take the first they see and reject the second, but that is not a rule. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 08:03:13
It would still have been a hard fork...
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:46:26
If you increase the limit to 1.5mb or 2mb, there will be a hard fork. When a block larger than 1mb is broadcast, some nodes will accept and relay it (the ones that chose to upgrade / adopt the change), and others will reject it. 
If you know what a hard fork means, you know it is serious. Almost every node needs to upgrade, otherwise, there will be two bitcoin blockchains.

Yes, but this is ignoring again that it is perfectly possible to roll out a safe hard fork with thresholds and grace periods. Or do you really believe it is impossible for everyone to either upgrade in time after activation, or otherwise get a warning that they are not safe running and old version?
Edit: besides, miners are the least likely to lose any money, as they are closely tracking all developments and will choose to mine what they believe will be followed by the economy. If 75% or 95% or whatever of miners switch and activate the fork, they must be convinced that they won't be abandoned by the economy.

There is no harm in having a second secure blockchain, even with almost identical features.

Cold storage means it is not connected to the internet.

If all nodes ran in blocks only mode, transactions would not be relayed anymore. You can send a transaction, but it would never reach anyone.

That is a unsubstantiated blanket statement. Other very informed people think otherwise.

But enforcing a 1mb limit is okay? Arbitrary point of view.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:16:44
Good point, though it is unlikely that you could pull this off, as the nodes only relay the first transaction they see, and it spreads fast. (edit: attackers could actually relay directly to miners, so my point is partly invalid).
Even then, the fee is arbitrary, as bitstamp could always outbid the hacker with the tx fee.

Too cumbersome still. Circle is probably the fastest way for people who have a credit card.

If the core devs would swallow their egos for a bit and give in to the compromise of a 2mb hard fork, we could continue without a community split. In a way, the core devs were asking for it by not bulging a single bit, even when faced with the majority of the community having a different opinion.

Again, votes that can be gamed only influence whether it is implemented in the specific project, like Classic.

You assume that the 10mb would be constantly full today. They are not. You would be running your node normally because as of today, blocks are not even at 1mb on average.
Also, you could run a node if you invested more, which you would do if you relied on having a node. If you don't rely on it, you don't need to run one.

In fact, I have coded blockchain parsers and indexers in various languages. That `time` you see there is recorded by the the node when the tx was first added to the wallet. In any case, it has nothing to do with tx prioritization.

You missed the fact that this step will not happen when the blocks fill up for good due to natural demand. It goes without saying that a one-day fee event does not nearly do as much harm as a permanently growing backlog of transaction and rapidly rising fees as a result.
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:16:56
That is no evidence. The only valid evidence would be showing their cold storage with a signature. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:35:13

@_date: 2015-05-05 17:34:11
That is right, you have to trust human psychology a fair bit. This is inherent to the problem, though. Economics and game theory is all about the people and psychology.  Unless someone can demonstrate that a secure decentralized system exists that doesn't rely on incentives, this is the best we got. It sure is better than traditional banking by leaps and bounds.


People who turned off their gear did so because they were not profitable anymore. If they could do a 51% attack, their machines would be *very* profitable. It is not explained away by optimism. You can pretty much rely on people making a profit where they can, even if you are a pessimist ;)

I think we would not be having a debate to shrink the blocksize now, and would continue to happily grow our economy without any problems until we neared 10mb, and then the same debate would have started. Proposals would have been made to scale to 20, 50, 100mb, and the "small block" camp would have stuck to 10mb, or proposed segwit to get 17mb.

Yes, miners, VC-backed companies and reddit all give a good indication of the overall sentiment, as they represent many parts of the bitcoin community.


You are mixing two separate things. I don't have to like their personal questions but still appreciate that they are currently a big part of Bitcoin and Bitcoin adoption. In any case, no matter how you turn it, there was a large number of people from all tranches of the bitcoin community with opposing views. 


See Gavin and Mike's reasoning as to why they did not appear. Others appeared and made alternative proposals, like Peter R. It is hard justifying going to a conference when you know that whatever is proposed, the stuff proposed by core devs will be the one the core devs will advocate for and ignore everything else.
I am aware of the fact that stopping ideas is impossible, which is why we have and forum.bitcoin.com etc. Still, the censorship most definitely had a big influence in bias against alternative proposals.
Discussing possible future directions of Bitcoin, especially when they are very relevant to the short term development, is not simply off topic. Deleting that (and having thousands of people being pissed and complaining loudly) is very obviously censorship and not normal moderation of off topic material.
Same goes for changing the default thread sorting mode, which only ever happens if it helps Theymos' cause, never the other way.
Seeing people like you being okay with that kind of moderation is very frustrating. 
No matter what the details are, my original point still stands: the core devs are facing a community split because they did not compromise even a bit, which they easily could do.

Miners turning off their rigs does not automatically give other miners the power to perform 51%. Suppose they could do a 51% though. You would have to define what attack they would do specifically with that hashrate, and whether that would be more profitable than just mining (and selling) the bitcoins.
It must be a double spend of epic proportions, where the attacker receives some good or a currency other than bitcoin, to trump simply mining all day every day.
So which specific attack do you have in mind that a miner having 51% can pull off?

This is unrelated. Segwit adoption can be slow because there is no need to use it immediately.


There is on such thing. You do the fork only after you have the hashing powr backing it and given everyone time to upgrade.


You ignore that everyone would have upgraded before the fork happens. 
Without realizing it? Let's be realistic: given a grace period of one or two months, and an alert message broadcast, not a single full node that manages real money will fail to upgrade.

BS. With enough lead time, everyone will have upgraded for a simple reason: no one likes losing money.
If there is indeed a residual chaos, it will be resolved very quickly, for the same reason.

And SPV clients even more. This is not the point, you want bandwidth reduction while running a full node that contributes fully to the network
@_date: 2016-03-14 22:03:29
It is a fully verifying node, but it does not relay transactions, which can be important to you, and certainly is important for the network. If everyone ran blocksonly, Bitcon would not function.

Bitcoin is what is run by the bitcoin community. If the whole community gets together to increase the blocksize limit or the coin supply, it is still bitcoin, just as Bitcoin with p2sh scripts is also still Bitcoin.
Whether it makes a project like Classic look foolish or not is an entirely different topic than whether it is a good idea that people can vote on certain changes.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:25:47
My point stands: they went the sigwit route with no compromise, and are facing the backlash.
I think no one is saying segwit should not be done. It is awesome! Just not primarily for a short term scaling fix.


If they wanted, they could implement segwit easily alongside a 2mb hardfork, and still keep the maximum at 2mb, i.e. with a rule like this:  `segregated witness data + block data &lt;= 2mb AND block data &lt;= 2mb`. Priority could be given to segwit transactions, but it would work regardless.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:41:47
I agree that nodes should get compensation for their work, but this has nothing to do with the blocksonly vs. full node question. If everyone ran blocksonly mode, bitcoin wouldn't work anymore. Also, blocksonly mode clients rely on the "charity" of others to download the blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-30 00:16:31
You might overestimate the number of non-agile businesses relying on Bitcoin. I think it is safe to say that any company running Bitcoin nodes and relying on those nodes as part of their business can feasible manage to upgrade within, say, 3 months.
Besides, this is an apples to oranges comparison. Everyone who did not patch the heartbleed bug obviously was not at a high risk of losing money.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:41:47


My assumption, from the beginning, was that the number of transactions would increase, not the fee per transaction. If there are many transactions, the fee per transaction can still stay relatively low.

@_date: 2016-01-18 16:51:14


I refuse to believe that a well planned hard fork presents any real danger. The fork can be scheduled far ahead, have a 95% miner majority, can only kick in once bitnodes reports most of the nodes also upgraded (optional), and a long grace period for all other nodes to upgrade once they know it is happening. The last remaining nodes that failed to upgrade (if there will be any, doubtful) have no one but themselves to blame.

Sorry if I sound naive, I have not looked at all into how the current moderation system works, but I will throw out an idea anyway.
What about letting both the vendor and the buyer choose a list of mods for the purchase, and in case of dispute, either a random one is picked, or a random sample that can vote on the matter is picked?
Having the vendor choose one mod or a list of mods and the user agreeing is a subset of that.

I am fully aware of that and this is what I mean. Miners can reject low fee transactions, resp. create a soft block size limit (like it was the case at 700kb before the stress tests started).
The soft block size limit is the natural limit for the miners above which they cannot work profitably anymore due to orphan rates etc.

You can redefine any censorship as moderation if it becomes part of the "rules". Especially if the rules can be interpreted one way or the other in each case.

No, because this is something no one else would agree with. In the blocksize thing, many more people from other parts of the community agree that an increase is desirable.
I agree that Mike is not the right person to lead this. What about Gavin, though? I have immense trust in him, he has proven himself, and I don't think he takes centralization lightly.
Edit: I do not disagree at all with Core's scaling plan on a technical level. I am merely pointing out that their absolute lack of willingness to compromise contributes a lot to the community split. It wouldn't kill them to allow a 2mb hardfork.

You stated the risks given the hardfork won't be resolved. Everyone is ignoring the fact that making it so it will be resolved cleanly is relatively easy. 
After all this debate and with virtually everyone agreeing with 2mb, the likelihood of pulling off a hardfork successfully is 100%.
You can introduce the hardfork a while down the line, activate only with 95% of mining power behind it, and a long reasonable grace period for Bitpay, Coinbase and all other merchants to upgrade. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:35:56
Miners can put a soft block size limit or request whatever fees they want to keep them running in absence of block rewards.

I don't see the hardfork on the roadmap. Did I read over it or is it really missing?
Also, even though I was talking about hardforks in general (many people argue against hardforks in general), I personally am quite okay with the 75% activation threshold and 28 days grace period. People overplay the risk too much. Once 75% are on board, the rest will follow (or else they lose money), and 28 days is enough to upgrade the important nodes (all that are securing real money), and the rest can still get a warning when they run an old node.

Same here. What kind of company running a Bitcoin full node and relying on it in a way that a hardfork would lose them money, and they would be incapable of upgrading within 3 months are you picturing? I am serious, I can't think of any such scenario.


See my previous comment where I laid out the reasons. You can bet that heartbleed was patched very quickly by all companies that had money/reputation to lose from it, like Facebook, Google, etc.
Especially the argument that companies will accelerate all upgrading if not doing so will lose them money.

- The historical Bitcoin accidental hard fork
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:36:26


What do you mean? The operators of the mining infrastructure can produce bitcoins.




Correct. Every participant in the community chooses which of the two they want to use. Seeing that no one would deploy an incompatible upgrade if they lost money, and having a significant split would cause a loss of money, there is nothing to worry about.


And again: you can create incompatible clients all day long, they do nothing unless a majority of the economy participants deploy/use it. If everyone uses it, it is a valid and chosen successor.


Could say the same thing. I am puzzled how anyone would think that an upgrade to bitcoin that everyone deploys would be altcoin.

Well, at least it removes one barrier to increased onchain scaling: that less and less people can run regular full nodes due to bandwidth consumption. We need to work on all fronts to remove all the barriers to onchain scaling. Not merging useful work that reduces bandwidth up to 50% just because it does not immediately allow for massive onchain scaling is not right.

It is a bit ironic. If Core did not stall on the issue for years, and especially 2015, we would have had plenty of time for a well planned hardfork. Segwit's accelerated deployment only came about due to the ongoing pressure to find a short term scaling solution.
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:18:21


Not if the fork is well planned and everyone upgrades before the actual fork. I am baffled that everyone keeps forgetting that a hardfork would be planned and not forced against everyone's will.


This is one of the two core points in the debate. Introducing a fee market is something we have never had before, and as such is very risky without proper testing and analysis, which was not done. Many also think that a fee market will make bitcoin too expensive for many, hindering adoption, which is another high risk for bitcoin's long term success.

Sure, but on the other hand, this is a feature that is easily solved outside the core protocol, and already is. Everything you add in the core increases the amount of thinking, testing, and discussion on every future change or addition, a lot more than in non-distributed protocols/projects.

Anyone can stand up and do something about the coin supply. There, however it is clear, that close to 100% are opposed.
Blocksize limit: close to 100% are in favor.
Who is to say that the default mode is to not do anything? Not doing anything should have equal weight to doing something in the decision.
Discussing this issue has a bias towards not doing anything, which is not justified. It becomes especially ridiculous if you consider that 1mb was put in place fairly arbitrarily back in the day. The limit could have been 2mb, or 5mb, etc., which would be the default now.

Unfortunately, Core doesn't come with the option to index all utxos. You can manually add watch only addresses, but it needs to scan the whole chain first, which is slow.

It only looks controversial because of a very vocal small minority. A minority with no special expertise in economics at that.

I am not opposing just for the sake of it, but that BIP you posted, I am unsure what it has to do with the discussion. It was an accidental hardfork based on a bug in the db and I see no connection to the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:27:26
It is not always clear like that. Increasing use cases in one area might decrease use cases in others.
I.e. we could increase use cases of very fast transactions like credit cards currently have, but doing it in a naive way would mean becoming more like credit cards, which cripples all sorts of interesting use cases.

We are not talking about Core or XT, which are just implementations, but the protocol. It should not be included in the protocol. It is equally suited for Core and XT, as they have the same role: being clients. 


Maybe yes, but there is something to be said for having a reference implementation for all parts that make up the ecosystem. Besides, they don't hurt the protocol, they are like separate projects, just living in the same repo. I.e. bitcoind, bitcoin-qt, etc.

To be fair, 3 days of backlog is a lot better than 30 days. Also, this goes to show lifting the limit altogether could remove the backlog entirely, resp. that the miners are at liberty decide their own soft limit.

The anti flood measure was the dust threshold, not the blocksize limit. You linked to the conversation about that, and it does not talk about the blocksize.

The first point already is a big one, but I'll give you that.
The third one is hard to believe. Already today, there is a shitload of competition (dashpay, gmaxwell's sidechain private payments thingy, joinmarket, etc.).
Besides: if any coin is getting close to bitcoin because of some distinct feature it has over bitcoin, bitcoin will very quickly either integrate it, or have a layer sitting on top of it providing the same.

Technically, it is a bit unfair, since the hashing power comes from the pool members, and they would have got a chunk of the fee. It is not like the F2Pool runners would have paid themselves the fee and so it does not matter.

Or even better: instead of using sha256(passphrase) for the wallet, use scrypt(passphrase, &lt;very hard params&gt;), so that generating even one entry in the lookup table takes you 10 seconds.

On the contrary. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 12:40:10
I think you underestimate the number of passphrases you would want to scan. It is probably on the order of billions if not more.
You would precalculate it and store it in some efficient hash table. Probably on disk as it will be more than the usual amount of ram a home computer has.

On the other hand, querying for utxos in the protocol is weird, as you need to trust the node you're connected to. All other data you can verify. Verifying the utxo set takes as long as coming up with it yourself, then querying wouldn't be needed.

@_date: 2015-07-29 20:17:29
As much as I'd like a blocksize increase and no artificially imposed fee market, Mike's way of making his point by saying that Satoshi said something is weak. It is a fallacy to think that Satoshi is a prophet who get everything right. Questioning Satoshi's descisions and what he said should not be taboo. 
Again, I agree with Mike, just saying that he should concentrate on making points that are grounded in facts and reasoning, not by appealing to Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:07:32
To be fair, the blocksize change should be the only change in this fork. While I'm grateful to Mike, he is pretty much abusing the current problem to get his other controversial patches accepted.
The fact that there is such a version does not practically help. You have to find it, compile it, etc, so only the most well informed will go through the trouble.   
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:28:39
While the miners can produce small blocks and demand fees, everyone would still have to rest and process large blocks. 
What happens when someone builds mega blocks that kills the miners with too little resources to handle the load? I guess this is where the fear of centralization lies.
We should still increase the blocksize now to a reasonable limit to ensure the growth over the coming years. Just saying that no limit is too risky right now.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:06:00
If you use your credit card or ebay, you have no choice but use their protection services. An escrow market means results in cheaper arbitration.

All of what you said is as intended. Inflation is covering the miners to bridge the time until there is mass adoption. Imposing an artificial fee market can only slow down adoption as more and more people find it cheaper to transact in traditional systems, or worse, are cut out altogether.
Regular users running SPV clients is natural regardless of blocksize. Mass adoption can't happen with a shitty user experience where you have to wait for 30mins+ before you can do your first transaction, just to sync with the network.


And I argue that this is unjustified. The bias towards doing nothing when there is a debate is unfair.

I have provided a real argument: doing nothing as the default action is unjustified, as it is just a historical accident. If Satoshi had put in 5mb as the limit, we would not have this debate for another few years, if ever. There would not be a huge debate about lowering the limit. Anyone suggesting it would probably be brushed off, just as if someone suggested to lower the current limit today. 
It was obviously not too large of a limit, or have you seen Bitcoin collapse under centralization, or collapse because nodes couldn't keep up with the blocks?
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:26:02

Imagine Bitcoin having gained mass adoption already. Volatility would be much lower. It would literally be the only efficient way to evade capital controls. You can't carry gold across borders, etc.

It is not adversarial if it gets activated, which it only will if most of the hashing power is behind it, which it only will be if the hashing power owners believe that a sufficient majority of the wider Bitcoin community is behind it.

Good points. 
The 75% in the Classic release could not have come as a surprise to anyone. The threshold has been known for so long now, even before XT integrated bip101, and that it will be in Classic was also known a good while before the first official Classic release. All the parties had plenty of time to voice their objections. But I guess if it is so short as to pose a *real* problem, those affected should communicate this a bit clearer, and Classic could be changed to make that period longer. I.e. Antpool saying "a little bit short" does not convey that they would have a real problem upgrading in time.

@_date: 2016-02-06 08:59:04
You realize that the 28 days is the grace period **after** 75% of the hashing power has upgraded? Once the 75% is crossed, the fork is scheduled to happen, no matter if the grace period is 28 days or 50 days, so it has nothing to do with beating SegWit to the punch.
In fact, the opposite is the case: Gavin gave a limit of 2018 for the 75% of the miners to get behind it. Pretty slow!
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:07:05
What's your evidence?
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:36:21
This might be a bit blunt, but people who can't take care of their node despite the fact that they are relying on it for money (do you think those really exist?) should not be the ones stopping everyone from moving on.
Keep in mind that the nodes get an alert, and the news of a fork would be flooded through every channel: forums, blogs, protocol alerts, and probably even the big news organizations like bloomberg, new york times, etc.
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:52:54
All clients like Electrum, MyCelium, Trezor etc. are completely unaffected, so the vast majority of normal Bitcoin users do not have to do anything at all to stay safe.
This only affects people running their own full node and rely on that for their payments. Those are either:
* Professional businesses (Coinbase, BitPay, Pool Operators)
* Private individuals running Bitcoin Core (or btcd).
The former will upgrade without a fail after the grace period starts, if not before, lest their operation suffers. 
Private individuals get a warning when they start the client that they are incompatible and need to upgrade.
The risk of anyone losing money over this is pretty much 0%.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:08:08
With fraud proofs, it is.
@_date: 2016-02-06 20:54:06
I trust Gavin on the technical side. After all, stuff was moving along fine when he was lead.
Also, at this point (after a lot of push back), even Core devs concede that 2mb is not an issue, and are just in favor of a different scaling plan. There can be more than one valid approach to scaling, not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2016-02-10 22:58:31


Because we know the growth rate of Bitcoin, and that blocks are damn near full, and will certainly be sometime this year.


The blocksize subsidy is also not gonna be zero anytime soon.
Miner revenue = number of transactions * average transaction fee * bitcoin value
We can easily tune the first factor, and the third factor will also grow significantly unless we kneecap bitcoin adoption by limiting the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:01:18
In case anyone missed it in this sub: they started giving their miners the option to vote for a certain implementation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:38:38
You are also trusting others to feed you the right chain. As a full node, you only verify the correct thing if at least one of the nods tells you the truth. The same goes for fraud proofs: if you have only one verifier tell you the truth, you are good.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:10:57
100% only sounds big, but 200% of something very small is still very small. Also, cost is not doubled until the the 2mb blocks fill up, which is not immediate, and by the time they fill up, your bandwidth and hardware got that much cheaper *again*, like in every one of the last 5 years where people saved money that way.

If core switches the hash function, you lose one of the main things making the coin valuable: security through hashing power.

I just commented the feasibility to upgrade in 28 days, nothing else.
Plenty of people want an update for idealogical reasons, plenty of people want the opposite for idealogical reasons. No matter what happens, both will pretty surely converge on one one of the chains because no one likes their coins to be worth a lot less than before.

I am not ignoring anything, just pointing out that increasing the fees is not the only way to fund miners. People often seem to forget that.
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:19:08
Yes, I get that. I was just writing down that formula because the main post of this thread is talking about how Core devs also want increased fee pressure soon, and that decentralization is far from their only goal with keeping the blocks small.

Honestly curious.
@_date: 2016-02-07 16:45:20
I do see your point, but I also do not believe that in this instance, it would lead to real problems. I stand by what I wrote above: if you are in Bitcoin in a way that you rely on your node for profits, you are very likely up to date with the relevant news anyway (is there really anyone out there who relies on their node heavily but has not heard anything about a possible hardfork?), and if not, you have the grace period in which you will most definitely get the news.
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:46:56
That you are way more likely to forget the phrase than lose a hard copy backed up in multiple secure locations.
If he meant the memorizing it part. I think it does not hurt if you have the other redundancy.
@_date: 2016-02-06 09:08:17
Most of today's spv users like MyCelium, Trezor, etc. do not actually talk to random nodes, but to nodes ran by some companies, which have a good handle on it, and will upgrade in time if needed.
SPV users connecting to random nodes to get their data will have to upgrade. I am not sure, but I would hope that this kind of SPV client supports bitcoin protocol alerts and warnings about being incompatible. If not, it is a good time to up the quality of SPV clients.
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:52:34
As long as Trezor cannot be powered by your own node, it is not as good, privacy-wise.

The stress tests did not prove anything, because the backlog was not growing indefinitely, but only for a short while. Mike's post goes into what happens when the backlog grows forever (sustained rate of transactions that is higher than the network can handle). 
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:23:18
Luckily, neither CPU nor hard disks are a problem for Bitcoin now or in the foreseeable future. CPU is keeping up well with one block every ten minutes, and hard disks are still dirt cheap.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:10:01
To be fair, one scenario is that the node operator is just not able to maintain it for that period of time, because of traveling, hospitalization, etc. 
Can you explain why you chose a relatively short grace period instead of a longer one (to avoid the controversy)? Once the grace period starts, the fork is happening regardless, so does it matter if it is one or three months?
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:59:26
Miner revenue = number of transactions * average fee per transaction
You can increase either one of the two factors. I prefer the first.
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:52:53
The reason why the last 25% take longer to sync than the first 75% is because in the beginning, the blocks are pretty much empty, and begin to get larger over time.
I assume the percentage in the progress tracks the block numbers, and not the total size in megabytes, transactions, or similar.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:50:13
Paycoin was also discussed here. What is your point?
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:19:07
Miner revenue = amount of transactions * average fee per transaction in bitcoin * value of one bitcoin in &lt;local miner currency&gt;
Increasing any of those factors would solve the long term security. I prefer factor to increase  and  and not  (at least not significantly).
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:13:02
Hang in there, we'll get there. Oh and by the way, the forks and how they are handled is exactly as intended and nothing to worry. The majority is hashing on the right chain and therefore it wins.
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:27:16
You did not say that though, you said that for larger amounts, he should be using Coinkite for multisig. OP is using MyCelium, and nothing indicates he is having a large amount on there.
On top of that, the alternative you make advertisements for is not even a mobile wallet, so it is no replacement for MyCelium.
Plugging in Coinkite in unrelated topics comes across as spammy,  just saying. Coinkite is awesome, you don't have to make a bad impression like that.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:56:40
We could have all forked responsibly if Core had been on board and helped planned and coordinate the fork. I don't believe for a second that a well planned hard fork would pose any danger.
@_date: 2016-02-04 07:54:41
I tend to agree, but sometimes, it is relevant to the discussion, like now, where it is about the split between the subs and the perceived bias in each of them.
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:15:19


Even if they want to, the complexity is still shifted to them. 


You misunderstood which part of the timeline is unpredictable. It is the period *after* the fork has been deployed. In segwit, it could be a week or a two years until we the capacity increases. With the hardfork, it is immediate.


Fees will be insufficient for mining if you shut out the majority of users and hinder adoption.
Plan for success. Artificial quotas are bad: 
@_date: 2016-02-06 09:21:02
This is where the magic of economic incentives kicks in. 
1. Miners will not upgrade if they think that the wider community would not support it, or else they lose a lot of money.
You are afraid that miners do not understand things and would do things blindly, but there are only a handful of big pools, and I am convinced they do their own due diligence and try not to destroy their operation, so they will gauge if the wider community would be on board. Since BitPay, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Shapeshift, and many others that factually constitute a very big portion of the real economy already voiced support for blocksize increases, I don't expect big problems.
1. When the grace period starts and the fork is scheduled to happen, due to point 1., most likely a good majority (most likely 75% or more) will have no fundamental issues with the change and will upgrade their nodes. The rest will upgrade even despite not liking it, because else, they will be stuck on the losing chain which becomes worthless very quickly.
I agree that 4 weeks is a bit short, but on the other hand, doable. I assume nodes powering big operations are the hardest/slowest to upgrade, but since they managed to upgrade Core major versions quickly as well, they sure can do this upgrade as well.
About the community split: if the 2mb fork really happens and the grace period starts, Core would also have to apply the 2mb patch, or become useless. Since they are so very stubborn, Core might just rather die before doing that, but I do hope they are reasonable enough not to give up in light of a pretty minor change like a small blocksize limit bump.

You can send transactions without running a full node. Whether you run a node or not has zero bearing on whether you are censored. It is about the miners and whether they will mine your transaction.

That is a fallacy. I present you the miner income in a formula:
    income = (number of transactions in the block) * (average fee per transaction) * (value of one bitcoin in the miner's local currency)
You propose to increase the second factor to ensure security. I would much rather see factor number one and three increase instead, which would serve the same purpose.

I know very well what segwit does, thank you. 
People can very easily identify that if the growth in transaction rate continues like in the past for a short while longer, we will get to a stage of ever growing backlog this year. Whether that is a problem is anyone's guess, but just saying that it is not is equally invalid as claiming it is.
Peter R. has some good blog posts about how sticking to small blocks is in fact inducing a big, untested change in the ecosystem, while growing the blocksize is actually sticking to status quo, even though it sounds counter intuitive.

Would you want the fees to increase even if increasing the other two would solves the sustainability of miners? If so, why?
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:32:23
Then it would be different, but I deem this unlikely because if 25% of the hardfork opponents are holding 99%, miners would not support the fork, because they would lose a big chunk of money.
See what I wrote here about economic incentives:

Competition fosters innovation. Bitcoin is not exempt from that. 


Raising the limit is deemed a good idea by *a lot* of relevant Bitcoin participants.

The grace period **comes after** the majority of hashing power is behind it. You bet that people can quickly upgrade their nodes if they know that in 28 days, their node will be worthless.
Also, why is everyone so scared about 28 days? This is plenty of time to do a node upgrade, which comes *after* 75% of the hashing power is behind it, which also takes a while.

You could also just as easily blame Core for stalling on the issue for a year and letting this community split get this far. They could have easily supported and scheduled for an increase, even if just as a compromise for the community's sake.
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:43:44
Yeah, being capable pick the  chain that will give you more profits is perfectly doable without having perfect knowledge.
Anyway, while it would be possible for a majority of hashing power to choose wrongly and revert, I deem this highly unlikely in this instance. After all, it is *only* a limit increase of 1mb. Let's be real, this is not going to fuck anything up.

It is not quite the same. If you have cash, it can be physically taken from you, with violence, independently of you and your will.
If you have Bitcoin in a brainwallet, you have some control over it, namely: 
1. denying you have any (plausible deniability), and they can't prove otherwise
2. If they know you have them, they still cannot take them. It is up to you much much violence/torture you are willing to take until you give up the keys, but in the end, you have the ultimate control.

Difficulty does not change if the small miners never find a block, and it barely moves if they only few per year.
We don't have a mining monopoly, so every major pool/farm can go down. If we had a monopoly, we would be in trouble. 
If you rely on small time miners that barely find any blocks at current diff levels, your system is not secure, because any well funded mining farm can attack the network in that case.
@_date: 2015-04-29 06:48:40
Not really, unless the collective mining power of the individual miners approach/surpass the mining power of big farms/pools. This, you denied, however. If you have a billion persons running low-end miners at home that never generate any blocks, they are contributing literally nothing to the security or decentralization.
You should back up your claims with some reasoning. In all your responses, you have just made blanket statements. I get the impression that you don't understand mining.

Not sure. Maybe you'd need to verify each transaction and that the merkle tree root of the transactions is in the header. Otherwise, someone could mine a block with invalid transactions, and you would accept it if you only looked at the header.
Also, you would need to know the full transactions to know which outputs you can prune.

Around 44:00: Michael Perklin also has this flawed idea that the fee *per transaction* needs to rise to sustain the miners as the block subsidy drops.

First of all, not few, but many foresaw the Gox disaster. This very subreddit had warning posts for months before it went down. Once fiat withdrawals came to a halt, those posts increased a lot. Even more once Bitcoin withdrawals stopped.

Let the people decide if they need it. As of now, zero conf transactions are being used successfully by many businesses with no  significant problems. If/When they are hit with losses due to double spends, they can think about waiting for one confirmation.

Still a good point, as this can also be verified server-side. If I build a site, all user input is validated, and a numeric 2fa input field would have been validated to have that format.

I am in the no RBF camp (I'd like FSSRBF though), but to be fair, your argument is not valid.

True, but also cheaper. They wouldn't want to pay a fee for each transaction they are doing and bundling up (fee is linear to the transaction size).
And while metadata has to be on their system, it could still be a much cheaper and more efficient way to settle than what they had before. Which is what their experiments are about.

Let's just say that I could easily take an open source wallet and modify it to do double spends based on RBF now, whereas before, it would've taken me weeks to build something similar, and I probably would not have succeeded in making it work reliably.
I'm happy though that the thing is opt in, so the receiver can act differently depending on whether RBF is enabled.

Still it is hard to argue against the fact that hardware wallets offer more security. I could not care less about sidechannel attacks, as someone first has to get their hands on my device, and if that happened, I still would have enough time to send my transfer my coins, whereas my computer is online all the time.

Not at all. In short, this is not a valid analogy. In a study, there should be a statistical analysis depending on the sample size that tells you the likelihood of error, etc. If a sample size 100 is large enough to back up the point in the study, you can reproduce it.
Point in case: Bitcoin's price was almost $300 in July, and is $250 now. This timeframe of 3 months (which is also a nice regular number that would fit in to the series produced by OP) would show a big price decline.

You can have peer to peer money with central trusted systems as well, you don't need Bitcoin for that (like Napster was for file sharing). Censorship resistance in transferring digital tokens is the only new thing that Bitcoin brought into the world. All the other nice new things follow from that.
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:04:20
Yes, a judge in this case can easily reach the correct decision, even without smart contracts. 
A smart contract does not help you in resolving bets, unless there are clear instructions on how to check the bet's outcome. If that involves an external source, like a betting site, it is not reliable, since the betting site could deliver false info during the execution of the smart contract rules. A good smart contract system can internally verify everything.
You could aid the betting side with smart contracts though, when it comes to performing the payout etc., which could also involve escrow.
@_date: 2015-03-23 10:03:03
The problem is, that protocol is not specified, and worse, unspecifiable. The reference implementation is the de facto specification. 
So you'd have to reimplement it bug for bug. (which is pretty much impossible), otherwise hard forks are a significant risk.
That is why the cure devs have started pushing for the most sensitive protocol code to be moved to a reusable library.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:33:10
Yeah, but if you are happen to have a case which can be resolved by proving that a document existed at a certain point in time, you can provide the document and have the computer prove that you are telling the truth. 
That could be part of a smart contract which takes the doc as an input.

Number of users and mining power are only loosely coupled. You don't need more hash rate to sustain more users. You only need as much hashpower to make it too expensive to attack.
The hash rate goes up because some miners can get an edge this way, and the others need to catch up.
Finally: the current financial system uses **way** more power to sustain itself on all levels. More than Bitcoin would if it processed the same number of transactions.


The difference being only the latter is known to lead to a secure, censorship resistant ledger with incentives properly aligned, while the former is not. Proof of work is the only method known so far that has no such flaws, and might in fact be the only method that qualifies.

What I meant is that if they accidentally implement different consensus rules, it can be dealt with (fixed). Having multiple implementations is still preferable, even with a higher risk of accidental forks.
@_date: 2015-09-01 01:12:11
What other ways? I have only ever seen this way.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:47:54
electrum: encryption between your client and the electrum server.
Tor: encryption between you and the Tor exit node.
If you use electrum over Tor, you will have double encryption until the exit node and single encryption from the exit node to the electrum server.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:16:19
Yeah that does not contribute anything to the discussion.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:00:24
Obviously I can't rule out that we've reached the end of the road. When people say we're still in the early stages, it is assuming that bItcoin will reach mainstream. You could have made a similar bingo sheet in the early years of the internet and used that too for years. Until you couldn't.
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:20:17
The most important piece is missing: economic incentives, greed, etc.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:58:25
Why would the higher fee be relevant? So far it's only been about the first seen tx. 
Did you actually pull this off successfully? I highly doubt it.
With a bit of luck sounds not good. The miner who is gonna mine it needs to see the other tx first, so you really need to target the miner nodes and time it really well. In short, it's not easy.  
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:23:59
Refund it where? Sending blindly to the sender address is dangerous.
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:58:56
You don't even need sidechains. Colored coins suffice.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:00:25
Not just evidence, unambiguous evidence of who is right, computed by the rules of the smart contracts. That is the crucial difference. Traditionally, disputes have been settled by humans listening to other humans argue about who is right. 
A system which can determine what do when there is a dispute would not be a smart contract system, but simply a system that works as intended. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:42:42
That argument would work if the digital token wasn't an essential part to make it all work. It is an essential part, though. Blockchains without the digital token lose their one innovative property: censorship resistance/trustlessness.
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:50:45
So all those nodes going down could have stored the mempool on disk and not go down. This has nothing to do with larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:48:12
Reddit is open source, could just as well use that...
@_date: 2015-03-07 11:21:36
Yes it will, just as Bitcoin is still Bitcoin after multisig was added, or the other countless protocol upgrades.
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:14:45
I don't agree that this is the reason. Those people you talk about that get Bitcoin's brilliance quickly would also be quick to realize that they would also be early adopters at this point. They are just too afraid of taking the risk.
About Satoshi's stash: he can only dump his coins once.
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:57:29
Both Electrum and Mycelium suck for privacy (connects to servers).
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:35:47
Describing what a smart contract is according to your opinion would contribute a whole lot more than this.
@_date: 2015-03-12 14:15:42
Or... he could just announce it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:57:29
That's how I also understood it.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:24:07
There is an upvote arrow. `This` is the most useless comment on Reddit.
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:39:07
Does not invalidate the argument at all, though. Especially with $1000 per coin you would not forget you had some.
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:54:35
It is fair to assume OP meant the general population in developed countries.
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:49:14
Where is the contradiction? If some miners drop out it doesn't mean new miners can't join or other existing miners can't ramp up.
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:26:59
It be weird to blast all of reddit because of this subs moderation. It almost sounded like he didn't know the difference between reddit and subreddits, but that is also unlikely. Weird in any case.
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:35:02
That is with RBF. Before, it wasn't as easy.
@_date: 2015-11-10 07:51:16
I'm relieved if he meant pools and not individuals owning big ass farms. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:25:20
Just because you came up with a joke doesn't mean it isn't true.
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:00:03
Source or it never happened.
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:41:57
It can't easily be exploited, though. In fact, if you are talking about Bitcoin, it cannot be exploited at all. Only various Bitcoin services that are stupid enough to rely on the txid can be.
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:05:56
Just wait for the innovation to happen. True anonymity is very possible with cryptocurrencies. See for example the work Darkcoin is doing.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:12:28
Why exactly would you feel more secure? Afaik the private keys never leave your trezor, no matter which interface you use.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:50:54
I repeat: those are independent projects, with independent devs. Electrum's devs have no control over Electrum-doge's project or how badly they handle it.
Also, it's not even critical that Electrum survives. You'll be able to restore your funds anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:12:47
Electrum servers know your address and with that also who you transact with.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:18:44
Why are you so bad? Chill! 
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:05:09
People probably care because it comes across like the traditional system we don't like: the elite gathers to network and decide on things without the public knowing what was discussed. It's not transparent.
Obviously you can't prevent that from happening, the elite will always do that, with or without gatherings like these. Doesn't mean we should like it.
@_date: 2015-10-17 23:30:48
It's still an embarrassing oversight of the Electrum devs. It's not hard to create a lock to prevent multiple instances messing with the same file.
@_date: 2015-10-07 06:01:37
Not a good reason to downvote. Per rediquette, you should only downvote if it doesn't contribute anything, not simply because you disagree.
@_date: 2015-11-13 09:16:32
Summary for the ones that can't watch it? 
@_date: 2015-11-10 07:52:39
There's litecoin. We are not completely out of options.

It's just that crimes with no victims should not really be crimes.

Wasn't it you who reported that Circle wasn't interested it being listed? How large is Circle that they couldn't forward your request to the right person?
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:55:59
I just watched the video, thanks for that!
May I suggest a couple of improvements?
1. Remove the charts and all the clutter from the screen. It is overwhelming and disorienting, and everything but the exchange rate is not truly relevant for the customer.
2. You have a list of denominations and how many bills were entered of that denomination. In the video, it shows you have entered one chf20 bill, zero chf10 bills, 0 chf50 bills, etc. This is also clutter and useless information. The total amount inserted is the only thing relevant for the user.
To make it user friendly for everyone, I strongly suggest simplifying the UI, starting with the two points above.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:28:23
The recent blockchain.info bug comes to mind where some guy could grab a couple of hundred of bitcoin because of a bug in their RNG and sent them back to blockchian.info.
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:56:00
You are getting downvotes for implying that the Electrum devs cannot be trusted because of the state of Electrum-doge.
You are also giving misguided warnings, since Electrum has been around and popular for a long time now.
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:51:03
If you bothered to take a quick glance at electrum.org, you could have spared us those questions.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:16:36
Simple example: the dark market could be the dominant use case, and it would clearly be more than $0.01 in that case, but less than moon.
Or: a catastrophic blockchain reorg happens in 2020 when it already is mainstream, making people lose enormous sums, and knocking the price back from $10000 to $500. 
Or a thousand other scenarios which might not be very likely, but definitely possible.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:34:52
This is an independent project.
@_date: 2015-02-03 08:22:09
It is an open question whether sidechains work at all. Also, merged mining has its own set of problems.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:26:36
Who said that the private keys and the signatures are generated by the same software? Can be two entirely different things.

Ok, I have no idea how to parse this.

Stopped reading there. There are a million possible and reasonable outcomes in which it is something in-between.

Looking at the blockchain, it is not trivial to figure out which addresses belong to the same wallet. If you run an Electrum server, the clients basically tell you this info explicitly.
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:08:48
Did he say that in the interview? As far as I know, he always said that Asics were unavoidable. I wonder why he didn't turn up the scrypt parameters though, if that was the goal. The current parameters are pretty tame, not exploiting the memory hardness very much.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:11:05
No php is the only right way.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:14:33
Sure looks like a wallet for spending though. Totally reasonable for noobs to use it like this.
