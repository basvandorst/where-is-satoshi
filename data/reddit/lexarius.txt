The standardish way to do it is to give your estate lawyer part of your key(s). The other part, you either give directly to the intended party, or put it in a safe that they will have access to after your death.
The more entertaining way is to be a fabulously rich eccentric, spread parts of the keys and hints about them around the world, and then have your estate lawyer announce the first hints at the reading of your will, with whoever can get the keys first legally inheriting the contents.

From Mycellium's home page in the "payment scheme" section:
In a prepaid transaction mode, the Mycelium card is loaded from fiat currency (government-issued money) such as USD, EUR or others, converted into IoUs units.
“IoUs” are seen as a payment promise, which is technically embodied thanks to the blockchain metadata protocols, such as "colored coins".
The Colored Coins is a concept that allows attaching metadata to blockchain transactions and leveraging the distributed ledger infrastructure for issuing and trading immutable digital assets that can represent real world value.
Mycelium uses Colu.co’s Colored Coin Platform that is built upon the Colored Coin platform. Colored coins are digital IOUs, their value is the one promised by the issuer.
In a debit card or credit card mode, the issuer will make its affair of debt, or potential debt, incurred by the cardholder, and load “IoUs” in the Card.

Presumably this would work in exactly the same way as any other big loan. You would sign a piece of paper, receive the indicated amount, make payments on a fixed schedule and incur interest at a certain rate, and failure to make your payments would have whatever consequence your lender put on the paper you signed, or whatever your local laws say about defaulting on debts.
The lender would decide whether the amount of your debt is in BTC, USD, or something else. Realistically, banks would want to peg the loan amount in local currency (or a more stable foreign currency) for the foreseeable future even if they accepted bitcoin as payment, much like many existing merchant payment systems. Even if the loan amount was in BTC, the mechanics of the loan wouldn't change, just the means of payment.

The size of bits seems a bit off to me, like someone estimated that their eventual value would be 1000x of today. mBTC seems more practical for daily use at current exchange rates, at least where I live.
But agreed on the general impracticality of using whole BTC. The name "bits" is definitely snazzy and memorable, too, so it's got that going for it. And even if bits turn out to be too small, "kilobits" would probably work well and still be memorable - I think most people have a good feel what kilo means, even in the US.

No, he has to have some bitcoins first. A small amount, maybe a couple of dollars, depending on how big the microtransactions are.
Their exchange doesn't hold or process your fiat and they don't hold a bitcoin reserve, so they probably can't just sell you a few dollars worth of coin. I could imagine them adding some kind of bootstrap transaction in which a willing trader lets the exchange operators hold a few dollars worth of their bitcoin that a new trader could easily buy, but otherwise they have to visit a "normal" exchange, a local trader, or a BTM first.

The point is to be able to perform transactions with the wallet without exposing the private key to whatever device it's connected to. With a normal software wallet, the PC or phone has to have the private key decrypted in memory to perform the transaction (and likely stored encrypted on disk). If the system is compromised, the attacker could get your keys, likely in an unencrypted state. They get your keys, they get your coins.
The point of the Trezor is that the key isn't on the device performing the transaction. Software on that device asks the Trezor (or other hardware wallet, like the Ledger) to do the necessary crypto magic and give it back the result. The Trezor provides a screen so that you can verify the request is as expected before sending the result back. The Ledger has no screen, but has a slightly different method instead.
You can hide the seed code in a fireproof safe, bank deposit box, or your preferred means of sequestering physical objects to reduce the likelihood of people accessing it without your knowledge. Hiding it in Dropbox just gives Dropbox, anyone compromising Dropbox, or anyone compromising any computer on which you use Dropbox access to your keys again.

Even if someone figures out how to teach the average joe about cold storage and multisig and air gaps and whatnot, there's going to be people who don't want to do it themselves. When you don't want to do something yourself, you get someone else to do it. If a bank started offering to store your bitcoin balance *with the same insurance as other accounts*, people would use that service. Not everyone, to be sure, and maybe society would eventually grow out of it, but people are hard to change. I know people who still put checks in envelopes for all of their bill payments because they think they are somehow more secure than the ACH system.

It's set up so that the size of the microtransactions are smaller than the size of the deposit. So if you try to cheat by receiving your end of a transaction and then not sending your part, you lose your deposit, so you don't profit.

As has been discussed elsewhen, ~~lots of countries~~ at least three countries use $ for their currency, even when that currency isn't called "dollar". Overloading the symbol isn't problematic.
The arguments against appear to be either that bitcoin deserves something new and special because it is a new and special snowflake, or that bhat users want exclusive use over their chosen letter-with-line-through. I don't see either of those arguments as compelling.

That's definitely a valid concern, and I agree that unnecessarily adding confusion isn't great. Getting our own unique unicode symbol would be best. But if that doesn't pan out, I'm not entirely sure that ฿ wouldn't be better than the other options. Ƀ isn't terrible looking, but it's not really recognizable as a currency symbol, because it isn't one.

Think about it this way: The Mycelium guys are great and I love their wallet, but how much money do you trust them to hold for you?
Or for a less jaded option, how far do you trust your phone's security model? Are you really sure you know how hard it would be for a questionable app to grab your keys, or for a mugger's technically inclined brother to get at them?
In general, I don't think you should use your phone wallet to hold much more than you'd stuff into a leather wallet. Keep the bulk of it in cold storage. Paper wallets are (if generated securely) good, and Mycelium makes a product for this (Entropy). But they're still a bit inconvenient, and it can be tricky to use them securely. A device like the Trezor or the (more economical) Ledger makes it more convenient, and you can even spend from it safely on an insecure, compromised machine. The setup process involves writing down your seed somewhere, so you've still got a paper backup (securely in your fire safe, I'd hope).

Potentially. I imagine that you could use the same proof-of-work algorithm that Bitcoin uses for mining, except you'd get booster packs instead of coins in the coinbase transaction. The properties of the cards would be semi-randomly generated using the proof-of-work value as the input, with more difficult work having a better chance of producing "rare" cards. The result would ultimately be deterministic given your proof of work, since other clients would need to be able to independently validate which cards you actually got in the same way that the Bitcoin network validates that you mined the correct number of coins.
The wallet app for this could also be the game engine - tap your phones together to initiate battle or trade. You can prove to the other player's phone that you have the cards you say you have by providing their public keys and signing challenge requests with the private keys.
Of course, once you have all of this set up, you'll probably want some sort of places on the internet where you can buy, sell, or trade cards. A "Magic the Gathering Online Exchange", if you will.

They probably use temporary keys now so that they don't have to keep track of a bajillion keys forever. Keys are small, but they take up space and and, in sufficient quantity, could choke up a database table. 
If they make permanent addresses, you'll probably get one (or a few) at a time per account, and probably have the option to delete them (and the associated keys). This would provide an effective limit on the number that need to be tracked.

You send the coins to an address MtGox provides. They are credited to your exchange account. When a sale occurs, MtGox moves some numbers around and shaves off a percentage. Then you can ask them to send btc/usd to an appropriate address/bank account. 
So yes, while your coins are on the exchange (whether or not you're buying or selling), they aren't in your wallet.

A bitcoin wallet is a set of keypairs (as in public key cryptography). 
The public keys are essentially the "receiving addresses" that people send money to, while the private keys are used when sending money to prove that you are indeed the owner of the public key to which money was previously sent.

Like any other card issuer, they're required to notify you in advance of such fees so that you can cancel the card if you don't like the changes. So unless you think they're going to bait-and-switch you immediately for that juicy $10 issuance fee, I wouldn't worry about it.
@_date: 2011-06-11 21:31:38
When you're in a mining pool, you give the pool an address and it periodically sends your earnings to it. So about once a day, the wallet on my desktop gets a deposit. If I want to then sell those coins, I have to send them to MtGox. But if all I ever do with those deposits is send them to MtGox, it would be nice if the pool could deposit it directly. Since the deposit addresses on the exchange are single-use only, they're not really suitable for this. But if MtGox provided permanent addresses (like the receiving addresses provided in your personal wallet's address book), this would work.

When a user wants to add btc, a link in their interface generates a single-use address that expects to receive a specific amount of bitcoins. This address is associated with the user's account temporarily. Presumably, a background process periodically asks their `bitcoind` for information on recent transactions. When a deposit to the specified address occurs and has enough confirmations, the associated account's balance is increased. 
The site claims that the single-use address expires after 24h. Exactly what this means (and why you have to specify the deposit amount in advance) is not clear, since a bitcoin address can't expire and can receive any quantity of deposits over any period of time. Perhaps they're attempting to reduce possible "paper trails" by discarding the address keys (and the account associations) after they've been used?
Apparently they're working on enabling the use of permanent addresses so that (for example) mining pool bounties can be automatically dumped into an exchange account without having to go through your personal wallet.

I believe that's what I said. OP's solution of bundling a private key with the broadcast doesn't require relaying the transaction. Making it an output does.
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:33:47
No need to keep it safe somewhere, you can recover the coins without the device (keep your keys safe). If you're worried about getting mugged and having some unusually savvy mugger demand your PIN code and passphrase, you can use multiple passphrases - just tell the mugger a phrase that just has a few bucks in it.
Granted, the Trezor isn't exactly cheap, so try to keep it at least as safe as you would a "normal" wallet.

An xpriv key gives you everything you need to derive an entire HD account's private keys (assuming you have the top-most xpriv key). An xpub key gives you everything you need to derive an entire HD account's public keys (assuming you have the top-most xpub key).
So if you were to import the xpub key of your Trezor into Mycelium as a watch-only wallet, you would be able to see all past and future transactions made with the Trezor and generate new receiving addresses for it.

In this scenario the relay person is incentivized to *listen* for broadcasts but still has no incentive to relay them. If there's no blockchain-level enforcement for receiving the reward in exchange for completing the relay it's no good.
How about: active relays in your area broadcast their relay price and public address, either over the airwaves or via an internet service. You construct your transaction in such a way that it has multiple outputs and pays out the required amount to the listed address, and broadcast it. All relays in the area receive it, but only the one with that particular address has any incentive to actually submit it.

Suppose that Mycelium (or someone in the supply chain, or the NSA) wanted to hatch an evil plot in which the specific Entropy unit delivered to you is modified somehow to produce a specific sequence of non-random "random" numbers, with the goal of pre-determining what your private keys will be so that they can drain your paper wallets.
But if you provide your own salt value, this is combined with the generated randomness to form the private key in such a way that the hypothetical attacker would need to brute force the salt to get the key.
To get around this, the bad device could simply pretend to use the salt and give you the key it wants instead. To prove that it didn't, the printout contains the random number so that a mathematically inclined user could run the key calculation manually to prove that their salt was used properly. The device doesn't have enough power to brute force a "random" number to combine with your salt that produces the pre-determined private key.

Ah, there's a bit of confusion here.
Your own personal wallet is only on your own machine. At no time do you transfer private keys to or from the exchange. The exchange has its own wallet, and it never reveals its private keys to anyone. They don't have a separate wallet for each user, just a number that identifies how much of their wallet's balance belongs to each user. Like a bank vault and associated accounts.
At least, I would assume they do not maintain a separate wallet file for each user. I suppose they could, but there's no reason to do so, and no evidence of it. There's no "download wallet" link, nor should there be.

The differences are likely some combination of:
1. Bitcoin is intended to be money and used like money, even if it's not recognized as "legal tender".
2. Bitcoin can also, much like a prepaid debit card, be used to convert money into stored value, transmit it electronically to another location, and then used there to reconstitute the value.
If you were to hypothetically start laundering any significant amount of money by buying cell phones from a vending machine and then selling those cell phones back to another vending machine in a different state or country, the government would probably ding you for money laundering and make vending machine operators keep better track of the serial numbers of items sold/purchased.

[CryoBit]( makes fireproof, floodproof cards and coins. You give them the (encrypted!) private key and they etch it into the material. (They offer to generate the key for you client-side, but... yeah no). I haven't seen their products in person yet.
[RavenBit]( makes some coins. I bought a few to give out as gifts. Unlike CryoBit, they don't put the keys on for you. Instead, there's an indentation in the back of the coin. They provide an html/js bundle that can be used offline in conjunction with your favorite key generator - make some keys (encrypted or not) and put them into the form, and it will generate tiny QR codes small enough to fit into the indentation on the coin. You're supposed to put the private key in facing down and the public key facing up, and then seal them in with an included hologram sticker. The recipient can then claim the contents by peeling the hologram off. They're attractive and have a nice feel to them, but they're not made to be disaster-proof like the CryoBit products. They would probably survive a flood (especially if kept in the air-tight and very difficult to open plastic cases they come in), but they wouldn't survive a fire. So good for a conversation piece or "gift card", but no better for cold storage than a free paper wallet.
