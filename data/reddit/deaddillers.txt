(Assuming GDAX) There’s just overall a low volume of trading. Biggest wall is ~200 coins at 14,200. Any real focused buying action at all will get past it in no time. Have patience for 2018 to actually start its first business day
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:48:53
How so? If one pair of trades carried a $100 gain, then another pair of trades carried a $80 loss, what do you suppose is the sum upon which you’d be taxed? Are you saying the $80 loss doesn’t mean I’m only taxed on a net $20 gain? How else would this be calculated?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:21:13
I had difficulty at first too. This helped a lot
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:53:47
�� I have most definitely not had that problem. Mine is still directly tied and the Coinbase fiat comes from them. That sucks dude!
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:55:56
That’s a relatively new product for them. Their bread and butter is insurance, and it was handy to have bank accounts to draw from so they do that well too
@_date: 2018-05-03 12:11:07
That would be my trading data, so prob not smart to put that out there. Just something I noticed when I fiddled with the ratios for a day or two. I wondered if it might also have to do with the market entry point, and if that's the case then the ratio would be different for everyone.
Edit: Also, I'd need more than one account to have an N more than 1. Which why I was asking if anyone else noticed that their ratio affected the price momentum.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:23:42
And you're no doubt correct. I would add, however, that their agents/advisors don't work on commission. So once I talked to an agent on the phone for like 90 minutes about what kind of investments I needed to set up, completely free of charge and he was happy to do it since I'm a USAA customer. Just not an investment product customer. He knew it and still didn't care
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:08:30
It definitely works. Hope y'all got some good gains out of it!
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:35:37
Some might consider it a more stable asset than their country's currency. In that scenario, they're just trying not to get poorer. Does your fiat suffer regular inflation? Just one rare example I'm sure.
 I don't think you're wrong to say those who are investing in cryptocurrency would prefer their asset to gain value than to lose it. It does matter, however, whether or when they sell it for fiat. If they never sell, how are you valuing their assets? In fiat, or in BTC?
The people who believe that the answer to this question will change from fiat to BTC over time are those who bought and held.
@_date: 2018-06-06 02:09:14
I posted this because these folks all seem to have a genuine interest in the subject, half aren't sold on it, and those that are pro BTC give legitimate rationale for their belief that BTC has yet to reach its potential. A good explanation for anyone who has entered the crypto space within the last year.

Upvoted for "adoption" thank you 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:32:24
How’s that? I’m curious to know.   
Edit (before you answer that question): In your eyes, does this alter the validity of the points that are made?
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:37:20
As someone who's had their credit card frozen in a foreign country, I agree.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:04:40
Me too, and the reason it sketches me out is because more than half of the bot operators seem have stopped trading after 11k. The remaining ones are tiptoeing through a minefield of stop orders between 11.5 and 12k. With this low volume, it takes less sell orders to cause a big dip. So these frequent hits, small dips and recoveries... well, I won’t feel like it’s back to normal until it pushes past 12.75k or so, or the volume picks back up to somewhat normal range. Otherwise, *it’s too quiet*
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:45:18
Looks like it to me right now on GDAX, all the bots have backed off the buy orders and have throttled up all the selling positions
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:17:19
Is there a disbursement schedule that’s publicly available from the settlement? I’d like it for... research
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:39:19
Once the parameters are changed on the bots, they start acting differently. Ultimately there is a person behind them setting those parameters
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:12:27
A reliable exchange that isn’t scammy *::cough::base* and is easy enough for my drunk uncle to use? So much in store! I like that point, hopefully the oversight you mentioned is enough of a compromise
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:45:04
Don’t throw it away, today’s prices are fantastic in the long run. May be a good idea to have a few lower buy orders in place or to keep some cash in the exchange so, in the event you’re wrong in the short term, you can have a cost-averaged entry point into the market.
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:41:10
What are people doing with this? Is this a secret spy transaction pin?
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:31:42
Which time interval chart are you referring to with the EMA lines? 1h? 6h?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:35:29
What's your price offering? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:19:22
It truly is a pain in the ass. After it was done I haven’t thought about it since though. Seems like what you’d need to open a bank account, so not really surprising that banks would want this from crypto to support its use. What’s positive is that they even conceded its legitimacy. Hopefully this is the news that has spurred increased volume and price increase today and not just another pump.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:57:58
Thank you. To me his comments basically masked his suggestion that it's a potential threat. (i.e. see purposes 1-3 on the list)
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:44:03
You really don't think it's possible for a group with enough money to create price manipulation? Do you happen to trade with an API?
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:36:03
I’ve been considering this point for a while. I wonder if it might be wash trade canceling. But I suppose it could just be stop orders kicking in from big volume buyers
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:39:53
There's definitely some reason. Hope that helps you as much as it does me
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:11:32
Yeah, seems a reasonable thing for a financial round table discussion leader to say ‘we’d like it to minimize facilitation of criminal activity’ or ‘we’d like it to conform to our current banking standards.’  Perhaps it implies centralized control, maybe that was the fuck off trigger
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:38:09
Bitfinex = no go for individual Americans    
Binance you can do. Coinbase you can do. Both have useable iOS apps. PLEASE read up on the current issues going on with both exchanges. Lots of people concerned about manipulation/ scamming/ outright theft. FUD? Hard to know for sure. Personally I think there's truth to the concerns.
There are other exchanges, but I don't know of others with useable iOS apps. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:50:28
Nothing? It’s gone up like $700 in a 24hrs. That’s just getting closer to normal instead of wasting in the doldrums
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:20:14
How you feelin?... lucky?
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:40:07
SMASHED it in an instant, almost like the sell orders were pulled. Man I really hope this isn't a pump and it's due to the South Koreans just getting back in
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:30:07
I did that last time, bought in the dip this time. Feelsbadstill
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:47:59
Does this mean something other than what it says? Genuine question
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:25:17
Try sending a ticket to support, probably an easy fix at this point since the money's already there.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:36:38
No, they won’t allow it. They won’t have the power to stop it, that’s the underlying truth 
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:37:40
Yes. Then go back up. And again... you get the picture
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:12:09
Fuck I am so stupid. I suppose there's no way to reverse this
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:06:59
The limbo game... how low will it go?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:22:23
Yes, money laundering existed before crypto, that’s true. Standards are there to make it more difficult. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:24:45
I thought my browser had just cached an older price, but since the BTC price flashed the same number for me on my comp and my phone at two different times, combined with your comment mentioning the same price, says to me I'm not crazy and something ain't right
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:57:14
I agree with the last statement completely. The buy walls are vulnerable to FUD and it could go further down. To u/Smith056 I'd say it's also not a bad idea, in that scenario, to recoup your original investment plus 20% and then buy back in with the remaining 80% of your turnover profit. $8150 isn't too different from $7k as a re-entry point. Obviously you can replace the % above with whatever works for your finances, but I've used this strategy in several other financial endeavors and it's served to placate the FOMO as well as any attention you paid to the FUD. But the FOMO is real and healthy. I used it early in apple pre-7Xsplit pre-$100 and after the first double the rest has been on the house my friend. *Not to mention several other failures*
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:14:26
Yeah that’s a support ticket item, probably the only way to get it fixed
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:22:03
Then massive in-exchange drop, followed by a rush in, several pumps, some profits, news, panic sells, exchange shutdowns, reddit asking what happens next, jerks answering rhetorically
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:08:07
The guy said so himself when he sold all the coins, those dates correspond with large market dips. He’s been forced to sell them due to the hack, to compensate those who lost their money. Theft matters to people, affects people directly, and has long term consequences in any market space. I’m thinking you might be the one interested in creating bullshit drama
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:54:25
Is he though? Seems to me he's saying it's potentially a systemic threat. He suggested it should be directed to the [FSOC](  &gt;The Council is charged with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States; promoting market discipline; and responding to emerging risks to the stability of the United States' financial system.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:38:36
Well, I understand your point, in that they can try to stop you from using it. But simply stopping a nation (even a large one) from using it doesn’t stop bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:02:44
Binance exchange has a useable iOS app. May want to hold off a day or two before you sign up though.     
Some exchanges will let you create an account, some won't, all of which depend on your respective locations. Bitfinex, for example, is no longer taking individual american account sign-ups and forced the individual americans out of the exchange.    
Are you trying to be able to deposit and trade fiat for crypto or just crypto trades?
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:30:43
Additionally, Coinbase adds about $50 to the current market price on GDAX for your purchase, then adds their transaction fees. In GDAX, you can buy at the current market price and determine for yourself whether or not you're willing to pay a "taker" fee
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:30:27
GDAX has been constant 50k BTC Volume. Coinmarketcap covers all the exchanges' total volume.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:00:29
“Strong support wall”   lolololooooolllll
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:46:00
'Merican here. If you notice on Coinbase there's a buy button at the bottom. If you want to test it, you may want to remove your credit card to be sure it works. Buy a tiny bit and see if it goes through, without trying to deposit the fiat first. Coinbase generates a withdrawal straight from your bank, which is your purchase plus their fee, and your BTC is there in your wallet at the current market price. Depositing the fiat to GDAX first can be free, but takes time and the market moves in the meantime. So Coinbase charges the premium to allow you to capture the price in time. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:23:43
The comments that others have pointed out lead me to believe that the ECB's statements weren't supportive of banks purchasing crypto. I could read the article... but ummm... no 
EDIT: ok, ok I read it. The guy said they didn't see a trend in their banks purchasing crypto, and they'd need a supervisory committee to ensure that any banks who did would proactively consider risks. That's not a glowing endorsement 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:34:30
That was tongue-in-cheek about the arrogance, but this is a discussion forum. One man's (or woman's) opinion is just that. There are plenty enough to go around that's for sure, and all of us have to form our own and keep movin forward. I'll tell you what I think: it'll go up, down, all around, and some people are going to make boat loads of money. Others are going to lose it all. And it's gonna be one hell of a ride
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:58:21
So I've been watching closely. And I agree it's very fishy. [IMO] There's obvious bot activity, but that's been the case ever since I started watching the GDAX. However, it seems like an entity or group of entities with the power to do so don't want the let the value fall naturally; like there's a big save at every notch that wasn't always happening before. And the volume being constant just points to a constant mathematical formula in place. All just my personal observations in the recent movement and orders
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:54:13
I agree that he projected a big future in crypto, I just wonder what the FSOC is going to say about it once it’s in front of them and they can’t avoid addressing how helpless they are to regulate it all in order protect American fiat interests. It seems to me that they may see it as a big threat. To the moon I say
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:19:09
On a constant algorithm with a clear target price in mind (which is evidently higher), the 24hr volume would stay constant. The moment one coin is bought, it takes the place of the coin that was bought 24hrs+the moment ago
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:54:35
They're slacking in some of the blank plots there, pick it up groundmen! Bitcoin groundsmen would provide a more thoroughly verified code
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:01:25
See I don't think this is true with the API activity going on. It's auto-selling and buying with an upward direction, IMO. 50k volume on the nose for how long now? I think we found the bot's lower sell limit around $7k and it's just moving it up from there
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:40:15
I love these strong support wall comments is all. Expectation, global regulations, bad news can all affect the buy orders that are currently in place. Those buy walls are one click away from disappearing. I really hope this doesn’t happen, but today is the first day since $6k-ish that the depth chart has had a semblance of balance. I’m not uncertain about the long term, but I wouldn’t suggest that anyone relies on buy walls to prop the market price up in a reliable manner.    
The looool was a little meta, just a dumb joke.    
    
EDIT: How could I forget about the bots and market manipulation!? I suppose that’s the equivalent of divine intervention in the context. Unnatural market movements. Can I predict them? No. Do I think they exist? Yes, yes I do.
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:59:44
It’s a little tough cause there are really good exchanges that don’t have an iOS app, and the ones that do... well... seem to be kinda fishy sometimes.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:03:37
I’ll shout you out if you’re right. If you’re wrong, well, everyone should be happy

Thought we could all benefit from the Litany Against Fear:    
I must not fear.    
Fear is the mind-killer.    
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.    
I will face my fear.   
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.    
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.    
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only BTC will remain.    
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:05:56
It has SO many uses. Actually a really powerful mantra

I'll bite. What's your prediction
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:15:38
Not all banks will verify coinbase. They have less control over a wire, which you must have done to get it done in 2 days, but a feeless withdrawal from a verified bank account takes about 10 days in my experience. Specifying which bank may help unravel your mystery
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:23:43
Actually thinking that you're responsible for other people's decisions is probably more arrogant than just stating an opinion and letting it stand for what it is
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:41:15
