It's a fair enough exchange, but as I know better option is circle. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:41:07
It gets closer and closer, around 5k blocks left only. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:33:24
If I had so much money, I would do the same,  but unluckily I stack at 4.6 BTC. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:56:58
Buy for sure, it's a great choice, with mining you can try you luck, but it's not promising a lot. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:10:08
Wait a little more, support is coming. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:32:04
Feel happy for you, my father not even like to listen about it every time I mention sth about it, but I never give up. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:11:03
It was temporary, don't panic. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:52:32
It seems so good now. Probably it was temporary problem, nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:04:58
I never heard about for where I can gain a gambling licence, so I think it's legal.
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:17:05
I don't get it, why player  is not a winner as well?
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:37:58
Are you sure about it, if it's only 1% then buy bitcoins no matter what. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:13:01
I'm asking myself the same think, still can not figure out. Any help?
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:55:35
Keeping them in exchange it's the worst option, better like some said sold one half for now, keep the rest and wait for better days, or not sell at all, for sure bitcoin will be more valuable with time. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:50:53
It will be more and more by halving. I'm curios, how much will be the peak the day before it will happen?
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:08:48
Breadwallet is you best roption. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:03:45
So you don't know which wallet you used back then? 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:39:37
You can try with coinify.com. It's nice and easy. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:28:20
Wow, that's hilarious. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:59:47
Check out this 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:11:54
 take a look on this. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:46:04


That's what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:23:13
Lol, it's so funny, at least it try. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:26:01
Great video, HODL!!! Btw I love this show. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:45:32
It's so close, I can't wait to see what will happen afterwards. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:01:03
I assume that this place is your best informer. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:02:55
Interesting article, I like your idea with all this gaming method. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:44:49
Did you try with MultiBit HD ? 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:01:42
Some people are not informed well so it leading to this. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:13:48
What is GBTC? Thanks for help. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:00:20
I hope so, but I'm not sure how much is "ENOUGH".
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:55:45
He nails it, love this guy. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:44:02
How do you achieve that ?
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:18:51
It could be the same with the fiat money, I'm glad you like bitcoin and I hope with time you'll use it for everything and make a profit from that. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:09:34
It's great to have one Satoshi or another. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:23:15
I like your question, I'm curios about the same thing as well?
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:26:06
I never met service like that, but you will use an extra money or you'll get a less bitcoins cos probably that service will take some of it, so why just use bitcoin for direct payment?
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:06:25
Use hard wallet, not some online exchange. It's good to start with Electrum, or MulitBit HD wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-17 19:25:38
There's not a better place than this, always providing the newest info about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-17 18:11:44
Well it was 20% as i know, what happened I have no clue. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:13:06
How do you get all this information and presented them in live mode ?
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:55:23
Can't wait for season 2 to start !
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:23:57
So far it's all good, probably it's only you. Why you got such suspicious? 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:11:09
Interesting idea, but i think it can't be done. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:43:04
So much interesting video, he explains everything so slightly, I really enjoyed.
