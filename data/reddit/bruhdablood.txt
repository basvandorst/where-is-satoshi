Yeah I did hear the comments based on quality of the currency's design and rollout. I also did hear that regarding the advice to investing. I mean for me I just need to find a way in. I have seen other kinds but im inclined to make an entry using the most trusted, and of people I have heard from BTC really looks like it is the way to go.
Honestly I think the disruption is a confidence play to get hooks into the market on the part of established finance. BTC (Crypto in the broad view) is a long term Buffet buy and hold play. So ill give it a buy at my weak level.

I never though this could be a crypto concern. But I was really looking at it from the regular old card vs retailers angle. I wanted to see if the retailers would eventually make visa blink. or bend/

I guess I might start getting into the BTC. I kept hearing fo ran extended period of tiem that BTC is the best crypto because it was a pure crypto. Others were flawed in their design and implementation because founders began to try to enjoy extreme benefits rather than just focusing on making a medium of exchange.   It was sort of a moral ethic argument made by a tech enthusiast. But it stuck in my mind. If there is a positive outlook on this I am going to guess I could stand to put a few dollars up on the chances.
Binar seems to be indicating the obvious, that the overall market is still strong on crypto as an inevitability of the futre. So isn't BTC a top 10 in anybody's Crypto analysis
