Exactly, I get that for recurring payment Lightning is brilliant. Its the "but that one transaction will have some hefty fees" that needs to be sorted. Once layer 2 is stable and functional, we still need to make vanilla block chain payments cheap

have you used it? is it fully trustless?
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:28:05
Yes but aren't there fees for each jump the transaction needs to make?

I'm totally in favour of layer 2 solutions but we still need a solution to keep standard, single blockchain payments cheap enough to use as cash. Surely layer 2 will balance it out by taking a load off the blockchain, but I'm looking past the limitations of something like Lightning.

so is Segit2x just a giant charade to let miners save face by letting them think theyve got the power, or are their hard fork plans 100% legit
