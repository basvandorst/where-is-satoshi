I don't get it. Why leave coinbase? They supported other alt-coins in the past and will support more alt-coins in the future. I see nothing wrong with this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:45
Coinbase declared they are going to be supporting bitcoin cash for a while. I think on January 1st. Yeah, it's slightly early, I guess but no real reason for concern.
Besides, bitcoin is basically unusable at this point. Fees range anywhere from $15-$100, I've had uncofirmed transactions on the mempool for over 2 days (at "regular" fee settings), and there are more than 240,000 unconfirmed transactions on the mempool as of this writing.
I'm basically starting to use bitcoin cash for my dealings now, and recommending it to my friends over bitcoin.

Yeah, this is the idea stage. The whole purpose is to try a bunch of ideas and see which ones sticks. Most ideas look bad at the onset, but "make sense" looking backwards. This is true of almost any good idea.

This is very, very good advice. Thank you. 
The place is not bleeding money (yet). It's basically breakeven, but if sales continue to plummet it will soon. 
At the same time, this is very good advice and something I acknowledge. I've been an entrepeneur in some way shape or form for 14 years now (and I've failed almost all the time). But some of the takeaways I got from my experiences are:
1) Everything takes longer/costs more money than you think
2) Be wary of a business partner with bad credit. If he's bad with his personal money, he'll be bad with your business money
3) Stay away from competitive industries (restaurants, coffee places, copy joints, etc). You'll be working like a dog for almost no profits. It's better to be an employee if you insist on working in these industries. 
4) Business plans suck. Yeah, use them to a degree but your plan should be more back-of-the-envelope calculations than anything else. If you put a lot of money on a business plan up-front, you'll notice that the real world will not conform to the business plan. I speak from both experience and from friends. It's better to be flexible to a changing situation than to be predictive. 
That's off the top of my head. Maybe I'll write a blog post and put it on reddit one day. But yeah, Knowing how to avoid common points of failure is far, far easier than attaing success. I learned this the hard way. 
I still DO think that bitcoin is a good potential entrepeneurship opportunity though, which is why I'm trying to drum up some ideas with reddit.

I took over my dad's failing printing company in 2006. I never intended to have rentable workstations, it ended up that way. People just had to print so I just let them use my laptop, but that got annoying real quick so I got a station. Then it became 2, then it became 4, then 8. I soon discovered that an internet cafe pays very little for a lot of work because customers have a million annoying questions. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:20:27
No, my skills are actually very marketable (I do software development). No embarassment either. 
The issue is that while I think the business is not worthwhile to save in and of itself, I reason it's easy to PIVOT and turn it into something else. There's already foot-traffic here and the place is well known (if you are an actor in LA, you probably know of it). I discovered that running an itnernet cafe is a pain-in-the-ass and not worth running from an entrtepeneurship point of view, but I don't want to see it go because of all the red tape it takes to set up a business. There is a slight attachment to the area since I get a series of regulars around here. I just thought I would post up on reddit to get a different perspective.

Confirmation bias.

Copy store/internet cafe owner here. fyi, most modern copiers/printers (read: anything manufactured after 2001) store every single copy and print ever made on a local hard drive. This information is not encrypted either. There is nothing stopping kinko's or me from opening up the machine, taking out the hard drive and inspecting it's contents. Not that I do this (I don't), but I want you guys to be aware of this fact. There is an add-on to have the copier automatically encrypt, but it's expensive and most copy store owners don't get it. One can also have a service technician wipe the hard drive periodically but again it's an extra charge, takes a long time, and it wipes the settings of the machine along with the data, so you have to re-program everything. At least with the machines we use (Canon). 
Kinko's, at least the one near where I live, uses high end laser printers, not copiers to print. I am not sure if they have hard drives in them the way most full-blown copiers do.

Bitcoin-otc : 
It's an IRC channel where you hook up with other bitcoin dealers. You verify yourself using gpg keys. 
However, most people are reluctant to accept paypal because of the chargeback problem. If you don't have a gpg key or a reptuation on the board, they probably won't do it for you. However, that is the closest you are going to get to buying bitcoins online without using localbitcoins.

I concur. there is a client friend that put money into this site, she sent them money (like $1100) and was supposed to have money wired into her account. They didn't. We wrote back several times, most of the times they did not answer back. They also don't answer their phone calls on the number listed on the site. 
When I did manage to contact a representative, they said the minimum order for a bank transfer was $2500 and that I should send more btc. We  balked. We wrote back the next day and again no answers.

Coincloudatm owns and operates the machine, I merely house the unit at my store. They take care of all the legal stuff. In fact, one of the co-founders is a lawyer.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:36:52
None. 
The machine was bought and paid for by coincloudatm.com . They put the machine in your store and take care of all the legalities for you, but they keep all the proceeds of the machine. I don't have enough money to buy a bitcoin ATM, but i also wanted to help the bitcoin ecosystem. I figure I can get some side business consulting or programming for bitcoin though. 
I almost bought a coinkite machine though, and this is what they had to say:








@_date: 2015-08-10 16:38:46
It's basically like an alternative to circle or coinbase to get bitcoins. Basically, you transfer BTC to/from the machine using an app on your cell phone. The advantage of a bitcoin ATM is immediacy. You can buy sell up to $3000 immediately without delays. Circle and coinbase often puts holds on your account for days (or even a week) when you buy and sell because of fraud concerns.
Basically, circle/coinbase is cheaper, but slower. bitcoin ATMs are more expensive but faster. So it's a different alternative. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:00:06
So far two, but that was on friday and I didn't even advertise the damn thing yet. The interesting thing was was the second guy that used it was some homeless dude:  . He makes his money doing bitcoin deals and mining and stuff (cloud mining), then cashes out when he needs the money. had a long conversation with the guy, he was really interesting and told me a whole lot about cloud mining (apparently, this is profitable)
We are getting calls and messages about this already so i expect a lot more.
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:18:31
I do not own the BTM. It was given to me by coincloud:   . I don't get any money when people use this atm, unfortunately. I am basically broke so I can't afford the $20k to buy the machine and fill it with bitcoins. Coincloud handles all the legalities basically. I am doing this partially to help out the bitcoin ecosystem and partially because I can probably get side work programming smart contracts or whatever. It's an experiment basically.
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:46:34
Thank you! I just added my store to the database. It takes a day or two to be added though, I think they do it manually. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:12:28
localbitcoins works, but with a bitcoin atm you don't have to coordinate schedules. Just use  to find the one near you. A good rate is 5% to sell bitcoins 8% to buy bitcoins. It's more expensive than coinbase, but you can get it right then and there. The first time, though, they make you use ID (so they can identify you), and that process adds about 5 minutes. But after that, it's as quick as using a regular ATM. If you don't have a wallet on your phone, download either BreadWallet or mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:02:18
I think in the US, a winCEN form has to be signed (or something like that). CoinCloud, the company I got the ATM from, handles all the legalities for me. This bitcoin ATM is not mine, it's coincloud's (specifically, it is a BitAccess machine) . They store the machine at my place, basically, but they keep the profits. I make no money from it.  I am partially doing this to help the bitcoin ecosystem, partially doing it to see if there is related side work in programming smart contracts or whatever.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:47:36

No, my mistake, you are listed in coin atm radar. sorry. :( 
Those fees are very low. btw, I have a BitAccess machine myself in North Hollywood. Over here I have 8% buy, 5% sell and that's considered cheap here. Most of my competitors charge 15%!
How many transactions a day do you guys get over there, curious? I just got mine a couple of week ago and I get three a day more or less. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:27:47
Circle and Coinbase are cheaper, but the problem is often it's not immediate. Buying/selling larger amounts of BTC is difficult because these services often place holds on to the account because of fraud concerns. So it can take days or even a week or get your money. Some people value immediacy so they choose the bitcoin ATM option. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:42:08
The bitcoin ATM asks for your cell phone number for verification. Any amount over $300 (I think), the machine asks for ID that it scanned from the BTM. It compares the picture on the ID with the picture the BTM takes of you when you make the purchase. So it's AML compliant. The machine is from BitAccess ( which is one of the better machines out there. It's not like I built it or anything.

I heard about squarespace, and even recommended it to people, but I wanted to keep the site simple for now because things are going to change rapidly and I don't want to invest a lot of time into a website only to have it change in a month or two anyway.

You can get one for free from coincloud:   . It's a BitAccess one, so it's one of the better ones. They keep all the profits though. 
Still, you will be helping the bitcoin community and it's a good "tryout" to see if there's demand. You can make some side money by providing consulting services or classes teaching people how to use bitcoin.

No, we wouldn't charge for a meetup or anything like that. I just like doing stuff to help out the bitcoin community. If there's enough interest, though, I might open up the space to host other non-bitcoin meetups for a fee, although I am not certain of that.

@_date: 2015-07-14 06:30:35
I can confirm this. I own an internet cafe that accepts bitcoin and I've gotten a couple of people from backpage asking about it.

I'm a guy that works in a store with a BTM. The advantages of BTMS are: 1) immediacy and 2) safety. Although Coinbase/gemini are the cheaper ways to buy, they have low limits and take up to a week to get bitcoins. 
Bitcoin ATM's have expensive fees (about 10%), but people are willing to pay for them, especially for lower amounts like $100. It's also safer than dealing with a street dealer, since there are tons of scammers out there. Especially to people who are new to bitcoin.

No, I have no problems with those (or prediction markets, for that matter), but there's a whole class of COMPLEX derivatives that no sane person can understand, much less be able to know what they are reporting for on their accounting books. They're selling hot air basically. 
The problem with CDS is that they magnify the effects of a down market immensely so big disasters will turn catastrophic. Thanks to complex derivatives we are going to have a huge crash in the markets, much greater than what history has ever seen. 
Futures and forwards contracts are relatively tame and yes, there are crashes with those too, but not like what you'll get with CDS's. And yes, the amount leverage in these instruments is a problem too. way, way over-leveraged.

No, I meant the reporting of complex derivatives, in general, on accounting books, not CDS's. There is no reasonable way to value these things on the books.

upvote this if you think bitcoin is "late adoption" phase.

I have no problem with "bets" in and of itself. I do have a problem with the hidden "black swan" type risks that credit default swaps introduce into the market. What happens in a down market when the insuring company has to pay the claim on everybody's bets? It makes big disasters bigger, even catastrophic. Credit default swap is, essentially, insurance except there is not enough in the pot to cover everyone's losses under certain types of market conditions. And anything that CAN happen eventually WILL happen.

Yup, worked for me too. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:50:49
Exactly! Unethical as hell. 
Basically, her products provide insurance-like features to investments under normal market conditions, but blow up BIG under bad market conditions. Then EVERYBODY'S investment turns sour at the same time, which basically what happened in 2008. Do we really want this person to be a representative of blockchain-based technology?

let's have an up and down vote across reddit (use the wisdom of crowds to figure out the probability).
@_date: 2011-06-08 17:44:23
Thanks guys, I understand. Maybe you can put something on the website to explain what's happening? I wouldn't have known this becuase I haven't gotten an email back from you guys. I just happened to find this on reddit. Put a notice on your site please. 
Also, thanks for your service, it's really great!

Maybe I'm dim, but has anyone in the US successfully paid using the btc.com accelerator? It makes me download this weird app in chinese with errors in chinese and it's not accepting any of my US cards.

Don't break the pasword in half and give it to friends. Use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme instead: 
Basically, it splits the key 3 ways. you need two of the three keys to re-assemble it. So if one friend flakes or he loses it or whatever, not everything is lost. Put the keys in 3 different legal jurisdictions. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:54:49
I might consider that! I was trying to set up a physical exchange, but recent anti-money laundering laws prevent me from doing this. Does an escrow service break any laws for a small business? 
Maybe I can set up transactions for localbitcoins.com here.

It should be right side up now.

I am the owner of Model Printing. Who is this? Curious. We have not had ONE person pay in bitcoin, I have to start advertising our services more.

I own an internet cafe (  ) . I am eager to buy one of these but the company doesn't seem to respond to any of my emails. Does anyone know when these things will be available to buy? Also, what percentage do owners get for each transaction? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:10:45
 is what you are looking for.

Please do! I own a bitcoin friendly business (an internet cafe) and I have not had ONE person pay in bitcoin.

Who sent this and what is his gpg key?
@_date: 2013-09-14 13:50:51
Create a secret identity using gpg and attach the gpg key to a new mail account. Then go on to the bitcoin irc ( on freenode) and create an order through the gribble bot. Then either meet with the person in person or send cash via certified mail or expressmail. Break it up into a bunch of transactions and make it known with the person you are dealing with that you are doing so. 
The thing is is that you have to watch out for scammers, they are rampant on bitcoin-otc. So you have to learn all the lingo and commands of the gribble server. Instructions are here:    . My suggestion is to only deal with people who have long histories and many transaction (6 months or more at least). The trust database is here: 
I can recommend a few trustworthy people that I have done business with if you like (and can be verified through the trust database). PM me if you have questions. Finally, be careful of people with similar names of reputable people. Sometimes people take on an identity that is confusingly similar to someone else.

No, Model Printing.

Anyone know the things to look for hardware-wise for bitcoin nodes? Are bitcoin nodes cpu-intensive? 
I know hosting providers are notorious for oversubscribing servers. I don't want to give the network "bad specs" and end up worsening the network. 
Also, are there any recommended providers? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:08:16
No, Model Printing internet cafe. We are a internet cafe in Los Angeles that is bitcoin friendly. We accept payment in bitcoin. People from localbitcoins.com and bitcoin-otc.com also use my space for safe trading. I also help spread the good word about bitcoin and even give customers small amounts of free bitcoin on occasion to help promote. The sad thing is though is that I have not had ONE person pay me in bitcoin yet. Not one. 
We have to stop obsessing over the price of bitcoin and worry more about getting it adopted in the real world!

Interesting, I am the said owner of the internet cafe/print shop that accepts bitcoin, and it's true. I have not had a SINGLE person offering to pay in bitcoin despite being on all the bitcoin map sites, having a highly upvoted reddit announcement, and having an indexed web page. 
The bitcoin community as a whole should concentrate on user adoption, not currency valuations.

We used to be a copy place, but I converted it into an internet place. Eventually, if I can get enough space, I will transform it further into a co-working space. But I have to save up the money first. We, unfortunately, do not serve food or beverages.

Isn't that a good thing? If BTC were $20 tomorrow, I'd load up!

Thanks. Will do. I am looking for places to tell people we accept bitcoin. Want to get the bitcoin brick-and-mortar economy going
@_date: 2013-09-03 16:06:02
I usally get squeamish when I see posts like this. The concern with the bitcoin community shouldn't be "how much are my bitcoins worth?", it should be "how widely adopted is this currency?" If the currency is more widely adopted, the valuations will go up naturally.
