Told you
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:58:22
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:08:51
I just tell them that I bought some Bitcoin, eth, etc.
Then you have their attention.
Or tell your friends to download the brave browser and get bat.
There are many ways to bring people to crypto

Bitcoin Price prediction for 2020: $14,000

Craig said Bitcoin will die in december
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:46:01
Lol, not yet
@_date: 2019-11-12 23:49:32
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:39:51
Of course it depends on many factors.
Like the way you put it on, or the condition the condom was, etc.
@_date: 2019-11-16 11:38:30
Great conference
@_date: 2019-11-27 05:39:25
It depends on demand
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:44:30
@_date: 2019-11-14 21:53:31
I haven't had any problems using condoms for &gt;10 years.
@_date: 2019-11-16 22:07:49
So, what's the purpose of Bitcoin?
I thought it was created to be used like money, but I just see people speculating and saying that crap of "just hodl"
RIP Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:40:00
I will buy at 4k
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:57:12
You can go and buy something.
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:16:25
I do
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:23:35
I just bought a little
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:33:19
Second half of the year, it may go a little high or low but that will be the avg price for the last months.
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:12:51
But you can create and use the internet for to many things.
What can you do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:23:49
Rich people will go to gold, normal people won't have money to invest, just to survive.
So stop thinking that a recession means that Bitcoin goes to the moon and that shit
@_date: 2019-11-14 20:13:46
I wouldn't care, it's people's choice.
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:06:51
About 40%
@_date: 2019-10-03 10:08:09
Maybe... In 10 years
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:35:43
I think they are of those groups that sell you a course and promise you wealth.
Like a pyramid scheme, where you have to invite 5 friends to buy their course and you'll get a % of the sell.
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:41:19
Yeah, sure it's a scam
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:28:37
 if for example I bought 1 btc at 7k then when it was 6.5k I exchanged for eth. Do I report the .5 as a capital loss?
And what about the eth
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:13:48
People say, Bitcoin is not intended to be cash, but a store or value.
So the gov is right, it's being considered an asset, so you pay taxes on gains.
Adoption will come with stablecoins, not from Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:05:55
@_date: 2019-12-08 05:44:48
I think we'll get to the point where you'll be able to spend crypto anywhere (probably stablecoins rather than Bitcoin).
But I guess that will only be the case if your income is in crypto currency. Because if that's not the case we go back to the first point of spending fiat first.
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:07:33
And Bitcoin went from 20k to 3k
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:36:42
Well I don't know if as a capital gain/loss because I didn't hold it for more than a year.
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:07:12
@_date: 2019-12-23 10:33:52
He said something about eating his own penis if Bitcoin doesn't reach 1m by end of 2020
@_date: 2019-12-18 05:34:55
What country
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:54:58
You misspelled best president ever
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:01:05
When they print money, there's more money on circulation, people buying more stuff.
Money lose value, so companies usually increase prices on relation with the % of inflation.
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:20:37
Sorry, it was for the other guy.
You're doing great, finding a solution.
@_date: 2019-12-08 04:09:56
Why would I spend my bitcoin, when I have fiat which decreases in value
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:11:25
If you don't want to pay taxes get out of here and go to a 3rd world country.
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:28:19
RIP Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:48:57
What problems it solves?
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:06:27
Use coinbase, and don't listen to all of this toxic people.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:16:54
Before to get rich. After a lot of research still here to get rich
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:48:28
Sure, 1% of the global transactions with that power of 7 tps
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:32:31
I traded the btc for other coin that I'm still holding.
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:14:01
Ask a cp, it's like trading stocks
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:57:07
The reality is that people doesn't care about storing value.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:45:42
I'm not so bullish on Bitcoin, I hodl it just to diversify my investments.
Btc represents like a 30% of my crypto portfolio.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:30:04
And shady
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:19:15
We already know who is Satoshi, his name is Craig Wright. Jk
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:50:07
The world is talking about volatility, speculation, slow, high fees, lambo.
@_date: 2019-12-27 13:41:59

"Don't invest what you can't lose"
too late my bro
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:20:11
Good job.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:21:53
Stablecoins would make adoption faster.
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:11:42
Bitcoin is not that great.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:28:47
Hodl and wait to be rich and buy a lambo
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:23:12

I'll put the adress on the plate of my 2001 civic

That guy reminds me to Russell from sillicon valley tv show
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:24:26
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:17:33
Bet he's right
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:54:15
Who are you?
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:10:34
What about a btc atm?
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:29:31
It has to do with all that is happening today after the Trump's speech.
The stock market is also down
@_date: 2019-09-15 09:56:46
You're such a rebel
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:26:41
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:37:55
I don't know, maybe the government's will buy almost all the crypto and store it like gold. And we will be back to fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:20:46
I think it'll go to 9k in the next hours
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:59:21
I have like 25k limit. Not that I have that amount of money :'v
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:13:36
If you wanna lose money
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:58:55
Sure it won't happen if people just hodl waiting to be rich.
In order to get more acceptance, it has to be used in real world transactions (not trading)
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:19:46
Remember that you will have paid another 100k just in interest. So save that money
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:16:14
I would probably pay off the mortgage.
Then I would invest monthly around a 20% of my salary.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:55:50
In what way?
@_date: 2019-09-15 00:51:46
I spent 10k btc for 2 pizzas and I don't regret it
@_date: 2019-09-13 11:03:46
Do your research and decide if Bitcoin has a future.
How much do you think the technology of Bitcoin can be worth.
Then calculate what price can reach in base of that value.
@_date: 2019-09-08 04:07:04
Why would you pay taxes without any profit?
You only have to pay on the gains
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:11:06
Of course. Data is the most value asset in the world.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:17:47
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:52:29
It is good for trading not for owning
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:57:50
12% here
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:42:23
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:08:45
Just verify your identity
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:01:46
Yes, and I don't think it'll go more than 1 trillion.
At least not in the next 20 years.
@_date: 2019-09-15 09:59:09
It depends on what I want to do with it
@_date: 2019-09-15 09:54:09
It takes a second to cancel the plan
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:50:44
What are the benefits of buying at an atm rather than coinbase or other exchanges
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:15:10
 30% (last week)
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:42:49
I don't think it will go more than 50k
