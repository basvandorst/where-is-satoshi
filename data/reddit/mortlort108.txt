What do people thinks gonna happen when bitcoin futures releases??? What should we all do?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:59
Of course you can wtf. Thats why people are worried and talking about an upcoming correction. When it goes on the CBE and CBO i bet there is going to be major shorting

Hey guys. Ive been watching bitcoin since it dipped to the 9 thousands yesterday and finally got 1000 dollars to use towards bitcoin. Any advice on whether i should buy in right now at 11.2k or should I wait for a dip to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:03:23
The second dip or another moon?? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:26:37
use  GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:28:36
Small investments arnt a problem. My dad has loaned me 1k and I've set aside 60 percent of that for bitcoin and bought in at 9.8 and now I've made a decent profit while using the other 40% on alt crypt. Minors learning with small amounts of money isn't a negative thing.

Does everyone who owns bitcoin before the fork on thursday technically get free money?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:04:56
lol hodl practice
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:26:57
just bought in at 1170 for 600 bucks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:31
Can someone explain how this affects us the regular people who invest in BTC? Will this cause the price of BTC to go down if all these big dogs short BTC? When it goes on the CME is everyone going to HODL or sell(new to the market and not sure what to do)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:31
you prick
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:50:54
Set an account up on coinbase. Its the most user-friendly for buying btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:39
at 16.1
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:25
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:56
But what if the price goes down because the fucking firms short it?? Shouldn't we sell and then buy back at the dip??
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:36:43
so its bassically free money??? Who gets the fork? Is it everyone who has BTC before the fork releases?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:03
HODL PEOPLE
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:22:12
When should i buy more??? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:39
Hodl what you got and buy in low ya filthy animals!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:27

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:43
Nobody knows. People have been asking that question since bitcoin was 500$
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:53
Can someone explain how we get free bitcoin forks?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:26:22
Hold on for dear life is HODL
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:55:23

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:13

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:15
Hope you’re right
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:17
sold at 17 and bought back in at 15.6. &gt;:)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:39
you right
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:43
But they guys on wall street can short the stock betting that the price will drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:35
Should we sell on the 9th and then buy back in low? Or should we continue to hodl
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:12:08
could you explain what all this means? i get what the futures  are but what will a contract for 18.5k mean?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:30:32
don't do it. I believe its gonna go down. Sell sell sell and rebuy back in
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:19
he gave it to me to invest and its all going towards investing. I have 300 left that is in bittrex but haven't started to invest in any alt yet except for stellar lumen. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:29:48
well you can but you're taking a risk. Sunday gives wall street the ability to short the stock causing a big tank is price like we saw yesterday when it went up to 19k for a minute before it tanked to 15k
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:34
How are you prepared for the crash? Are you gonna sell or hodl?? I'm looking for guidance on what i should do before the futures go live
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:33:12
it hasn't dipped....It went up to 17k for less than 12 hours. Its still up a shit ton. Dont forget that it was 14k two days ago
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:40
Stop trying to be that guy who gets the feds into everything. This is meant to be against the system. Quit getting your panties in a wade
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:15
I personally am going to watch the day of the futures to see if they short it and the price dips so i can buy back in. Thats what im betting on but nobody knows 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:00:36
Can someone please explain what we should all do when BTC goes on the CME? Will this result in the big dogs being able to short the stock bringing the price down or what? Im new to the market and not sure whether the right thing to do is hodl or sell before it goes on the market.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:26:03
Im so glad we're having slower but healthier growth this time around
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:46:33
stfu normie
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:42:24
i definitely agree. Im buying into this market again anytime soon. Just gonna hold what i have and hope for the best.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:29:37
Why are people fucking panicking? Upward growth with no correction is incredibly unhealthy. Just chill out and do something else and don't watch the price.
