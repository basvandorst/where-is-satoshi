Hypothetical question.  Let's say a critical security bug is found in LND/Eclair/C. Lighting code.  What's the technical description of the process to gracefully close all open channels?  If the node on the other end of the channel is offline can this be done before the HTLC expires?

It's proof that Coinbase is causing congestion on the Bitcoin network.  They could at the very minimum be sending out withdrawals in batches to reduce congestion, instead of the single transactions they are doing now.  Sort of like congestion on the highway, if 50 people drive their own car, it takes up a lot of space on the road.  Whereas packing 50 people on a bus would take up significantly less space on the road.

As someone who works in IT and understands the importance of backups, I don't quite understand what would happen if a critical hardware (storage) failure were to occur on a node with many channels open.  Is there a way to replay transactions to know balances correctly if there is a gap missing in the backups, or will backups need to be real-time?

Thanks for the info, I'm curious to do more research on the merge mining part!  
I'm not so sure that the dApp devs of today along with their investments will matter much in the future though.  I still haven't seen any dApps that have a sound long term profitable model (besides possibly EtherDelta).  These devs are either going to be so rich, they'll retire from the programming marketplace, or they'll be highly desired for their solidity experience, but they'll be mandated to program on the blockchain with the most trust/brand recognition.  I don't think that will stop Ethereum, but more likely create an environment where it's like Linux, Bitcoin is like Windows, and apps will be coded in a cross compatible solidity akin to developing in Java.

The most apparent new addition to lnd v0.7-beta is support for “watchtowers.” Watchtowers are an important security upgrade for the Lightning Network because they provide a means to prevent theft of funds from nodes that have gone offline for extended periods of time. A watchtower service observes the blockchain in order to ensure that any node that attempts to dishonestly take money from a channel counterparty using a type of invalid transaction (known as a “breach”) is blocked from doing so. The watchtower protocol is designed with privacy in mind so that information about channels and transactions are only decrypted in the (generally rare) case of a breach attempt. 
lnd v0.7-beta provides for running lnd in “altruist” watchtower mode, in which an operator can provide watchtower services without requiring payment. Additional development is ongoing for “reward” watchtowers, which are paid for their services. For those who would like to operate their own watchtower, see the release notes for instructions. If you’d like to learn more, you can listen to Stephan Livera Podcast episode  with Conner Fromknecht, our Head of Cryptographic Engineering, for helpful background on watchtowers. 
**Payment Management and Tracking**
Another major area of improvement in lnd v0.7-beta is in the area of payment management and tracking. In order to make the lifecycle of Lightning Payments more explicit to developers, we’ve added a new set of RPCs to be used for sending and tracking payments in the network. These two new RPCs are part of the “router sub-server,” with the main benefit being the ability to track the current status of a given payment directly. There are many reasons why a Lightning node (particularly a mobile node) might shut down in the midst of processing a payment, and a number of additions to lnd were made to reflect the accurate state of payments upon node restart. The TrackPayment RPC call can be used to check if a payment was initiated before the last restart, or to show details about the ultimate success or failure of past payments. This information is particularly useful for services that use lnd’s “hodl invoice” functionality, including Lightning Loop In. With these services, payments can stay in intermediate states for longer periods of time, so proper tracking of payment states in case of shutdown is even more important. 
As always, we’re continuing to make payment routing faster and more reliable. “Mission Control” is the lnd subsystem responsible for pathfinding, and in lnd v0.7-beta, Mission Control has been updated to use a probability-based system that allows an lnd node to learn and improve pathfinding performance over time. This system also provides important groundwork for future routing improvements. 
Some additional routing-related changes in lnd v0.7-beta improve error messaging, increase control, and provide more detailed information about payments in progress. Finally, some changes to invoice settling were made in preparation for atomic multi-path payments. 
**Chain fee management**
Reducing costs for Lightning users is always important, and in lnd v0.7-beta a number of changes were made to minimize on-chain transaction costs. Most obviously, there are many use cases in which fees for Lightning-related operations can be significantly lowered for users or services that are able to wait longer for transaction confirmation. In part to support these cases, lnd v0.7-beta includes support for Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) transactions. This support allows transactions such as channel openings or closings to be initially broadcast with low fees that can be set to escalate over time according to the requirements of the particular use case. The external interface will evolve over time, but for now a basic bumpfee CLI command can be used to manually increase the fee for a transaction. 
In addition to RBF and CPFP support, lnd v0.7-beta also provides support for batching transactions together, which can significantly lower fees, especially for those users or services that perform large amounts of on-chain transaction activity. 
Finally, lnd will now wait longer for channels to open in case the channel initiator would prefer to wait longer and pay lower fees. 
We’re continuing to optimize the speed of the initial blockchain synchronization for lnd full nodes and light clients, and for lnd v0.7-beta, two changes were made to support this. As a result, the time to bring up a new full node-backed lnd node has been reduced from over half an hour to minutes or seconds depending on your full node version. In addition to blockchain synchronization, Lightning nodes also synchronize the network channel graph, and two additional changes were made to improve performance there as well. 
With the release of the mainnet Android and iOS Lightning App, support for light clients has become increasingly important, so lnd v0.7-beta also includes additional testing with Neutrino clients as well as improved reliability with Neutrino. 
**Developer improvements**
Some lnd v0.7-beta improvements that are particularly relevant to developers include some RPC calls that now provide more complete information about transactions, invoices, nodes, and channels. For convenience, two changes for managing RPC certificates were added. Improved infrastructure for node monitoring was added, and Litecoin testing support was improved as well. 
**Bug fixes**
Numerous smaller fixes were implemented in lnd v0.7-beta including an update for changes made in bitcoind 0.18. One protocol-level bug fix was made for a corner case involving “overlapping” HTLCs, and there were also bug fixes involving fee computation, the command-line interface, and channel backups on Windows.

I proposed with a $60 ruby heart ring off Amazon.  I wanted her to be able to help design her engagement/wedding band, so I told her I got the ring from a gumball machine!  Funny thing is, she gets many compliments on it, and still wears it on the opposite hand to this day.  We spent less than $5k custom designing both of her wedding set, and my band which turned out just awesome!  Not only do we have that great bonding experience working out exactly what we both like, there was also that important last chance to split and run if it turned out she was going to insist on some ridiculously extravagant impractical rock to flaunt around.

A few of the highlights (more detail can be found in the release notes:
Bitcoin Core support - previous versions of lnd required the use of btcd. Now, users who prefer to run lnd with bitcoind can do so using the instructions here.
New seed format, deterministic keys - a new and improved key creation and recovery system makes it much easier to backup lnd nodes and also makes recovery from data loss or corruption much simpler and more reliable. These improvements are also necessary for remote backup services, which will provide additional safety for Lightning users.
Vastly improved fault-tolerance - safety and security of user funds is of the utmost importance, and a great deal of effort has gone into making lnd secure and stable in the event of power failures, network failures, hardware failures, or other unexpected or adversarial conditions. Ensuring that necessary recovery information is stored at all times and can be correctly reloaded upon restart and reconnection to the Lightning Network has been a major undertaking for 0.4-beta.
Smarter Path-Finding - introduces an improved management for constructing payment routes. The system, dubbed Mission Control, incorporates feedback from previous payment attempts, to update the view of the network in response to temporary bottlenecks or failures.
Automated Contract Resolution - sweeping funds back into a user’s wallet is now handled by a concert of subsystems, that together decide how and when to spend all output types generated by an operating channel. Making this process automated, fault-tolerant, and intelligent has demanded an immense amount of effort, but critical to the safety of funds managed by lnd. As an aside, you’ll be happy to know that lnd batches transactions wherever possible ;)
Segwit Only - lnd has removed support for now-obsolete P2PKH addresses, favoring both native Segwit and P2SH. As a result, all transactions, even regular on chain transactions, will benefit from lower fees and be healthier for the network.
Routing node metrics - lnd now provides tools to track fees and payments at high-volume, which is of particular interest to those operating transaction routing nodes. Tools such as these can be used to optimize revenue, throughput and reliability. Let the gamification begin!

What's everyone's opinion on hardware wallets nowadays?  I own both, and each are excellent in their own way. 
 From what I can tell, both Ledger Nano S and the Trezor wallet were about even, given that the differences between the two were; 
* Nano S used security hardened chips
* Trezor is open source  
Ledger seemed to be the king given the lower price, however now you can pickup a Trezor for cheaper.  Personally I prefer the Open Source nature of the Trezor, given that both support passphrase encrypted seeds, it doesn't matter that someone could theoretically retrieve the seed from the device.  On the Trezor I can verify this is true through reviewing the code, however I can't verify that the Ledger isn't storing the passphrase to an encrypted seed.

@_date: 2018-04-03 15:24:10
**Notable Changes**
**DNS Bootstrapping**
Reported issues concerning the initial automatic peer bootrapping via DNS have been resolved. In the case that lnd had to fallback to direct TCP resolution, a bug prevented the DNS name from being fully qualified. This new release ensures we craft a valid DNS query.
**Channel Funding**
The min channel size that we'll create outbound has been raised to 20k satoshis.
When using the current version of autopilot users can now set the min and max channel sizes. Before this change, as this mode was primarily used on testnet, the default pilot would at times create a single channel using all available funds, which in many cases is undesirable.
Users are now able to set a custom value for the CSV parameter imposed on the remote node using the new --remote_csv_delay argument of the openchannel command. This is useful as peers that have existing business relationships may wish to relax the time-based security parameter in order to allow swift channel force closures.
A rounding error ( has been fixed. This would at times be an issue when converting from BTC to satoshis as returned by the various RPC interfaces. With this fix we ensure that we can no longer at times leaks a few satoshis when creating channels. On-chain sends were unaffected.
The ListChannels command now has the ability to filter out active, public, private, and inactive channels ( The lncli listchannels command has also gained the ability to filter out these channels with the following new arguments:
A new macaroon type has been added! In this release, lnd will now generate an invoice.macaroon invoice. The capabilities that this macaroon can unlock are restricted only to: listing invoices, generating invoices, subscribing for invoice notifications, and also generating new addresses (
One thing to note is that we'll only generate the invoice macaroon if none of the macaroons are found. This mirrors the existing behavior to allow an instance to be spun up, only having a particular macaroon in its data directory. In order for this new macaroon to be generated, users need to delete their old set of macaroons on disk.
**Payment routing**
Several cross-implementation payment routing issues have been resolved. Users should find they have an easier time routing directly to another implementation, or taking a route that traverses other implementations. Additionally, we'll now more aggressively route around any faulty channels.nodes based on prior routing failures encountered.
A new --tlsdomain config line option has been added ( This allows users to generate RPC certs that themselves bind to a particular domain. With this command, users are now able to expose an lnd RPC service that's accessed directly via a domain over TLS.
A new --minchansize config option has been added. This option allows users to configure the smallest channel size they'll accept as an incoming payment. Using this command, users can start to filter out the set of incoming channel requests in order to ensure their node has a healthy set of usable channels. The default value for this is 20k satoshis.
**Channel State Machine**
A bug that would at times cause channel desynchronization when channels peers use asymmetric dust values has been resolved (
We'll now ensure that we'll only accept sane commitments. This entails performing a series of quick checks for standardness and context-free consensus rules when we create or accept new commitments. Uncompliant commitments will be rejected.
We'll now accept incoming payments that pay more than the amount stated on the invoice.
Attempted cooperative channel closures while a commitment still has lingering HTLCs are now disallowed.
Several minor bugs have been fixed within lnd's Litecoin mode. The most notable fix is properly using a sane dust value to ensure we only produce easily mineable commitments.
**bitcoind Chain Backend**
The bitcoind chain backend will now properly reconnect to bitcoind's interface for zmq in the case of a connection drop, or restart by bitcoind (c653b62).
**Peer to Peer Networking**
We'll no longer disconnect peers that send address types within NodeAnnouncement messages that we don't know of. This caused unnecessary connection flapping in the prior release as there are several nodes on mainnet which forward such messages (which is spec compliant).
A series of bugs have been fixed concerning automatic peer reconnection ( exponential backoff when retrying connections to peers. Additionally, we'll now properly perform the brontide handshake asynchronously ( As a result of these fixes, users should see overall lower memory usage and less pending connection manager requests. Subsequent releases will start to introduce dynamic ban/DoS protection to further harden lnds P2P interface.
**Build System**
This new release of lnd packages an easier to use build system for those that are unfamiliar with go. lnd now has a primary Makefile. A new set of documentation has been added to detail the various commands and arguments of each make directive:
When using the make build command, lnd will compile in the commit hash that it was built against. This is helpful when debugging as it makes it easier to bisect git commits. Additionally, users will be able to easy discern which commit (in addition to latest released version) that they're running:
