I always use VPN.
If my gift cards has any problem, Amazon already closed my account. However, my Amazon account still alive. This proves everything :-)

Any LEGALLY supported ToS in the world can take user's fund into own pocket. We can take your fund because you are suspicious, and this is backed by ToS. So funny!

The middle:   The GC used for Purse orders already exceed 1 month. Enough time for Aamzon to check?

Paypal just holds your money for 180 days and they don't take the money into its own pocket
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:59:36
The only one response from Purse:




And then no more response for 10 days. I am not rush to transfer out BTC proves I am so confident with my gift cards :-)

I just know Purse robbed my asset :-)

One Amazon account can have different leading 3 digit for order # in some case. However, having the same leading 3 digits is the enough proof that these orders could be believed are in same account

I just want to put them into jail. I think Purse has already robbed many people by disabling their accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:02:40
No response from Purse since 5 May, already 10 days.....

I used the gift cards from Paxful and Localbitcoins. However, those gift cards have CASH receipts and traded legally. I usually buy items for myself using these cards. Those 3 Purse orders is to cash out my BTC as I don't any items to buy for myself at that time.
Moreover, the Amazon account I used to complete Purse orders are still function normally.
Here is the proof: 
I just made an order on May 13
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:11:53
I made mistake for replying the discount for the cards I get in Localbitcoins/Paxful. I said 75%. It means I pay 75% of card value to gift card owner, not 75% off. This mistake make so many people think my cards are full of fraud....
You may don't know how difficult for some people to get Bitcoin in Bitcoin in real world. People can get bitcoin instantly for their Amazon gift card using our service. So 25% off for them is pretty good deal for small amount trade.

This question should be answered by Purse. And they also need to answer the legal justification for them to take earner's BTC into its own pocket by disabling victims' accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:28:30
I can tell you that the cards are all legit. There is a very big market demand for BTC among ladies(backpage.com effect). As an experienced trader on Localbitcoins/Paxful, I know most of the bitcoin buyers for Amazon cards are ladies. 
Moreover, the size of each card is not large, range from $10-$60. Therefore, 25% fee is very reasonable :-)
Finally, if you think 75% are fraud, then most of trades in Purse.IO are fraud because the discount is deep 
edit1: I provide INSTANT bitcoin buying service for Amazon gift card. It means I should have more profit than Purse because people get bitcoin instantly using their gift cards. This is added value and legit reason for 75% 
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:35:08
around 75%
edit1: I said 75%. It means I pay 75% of card value to gift card owner, not 75% off.
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:12:52
Those orders' # all start with 114(as prefix). This is the proof. Orders in same Amazon account all have the same prefix(the leading 3 digits).
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:10:50
The card I got from Localbitcoins/Paxful are not shady. I paid 75% of card value to card owner. You may don't know how difficult for some people to get Bitcoin in real world. People can get bitcoin instantly for their Amazon gift card using our service. So 25% off for them is pretty good deal for small amount trade.

I want to let public know how evil Purse is :-)
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:57:07
The truth is I am still happy shopping with my Amazon account :-)
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:19:48
Those gift cards I took from paxful / lbc are not shady. They all have cash receipts. 
The most important thing is my Amazon account is functioning normally. This proves I am white :-)

There is no gift card revoke in my gift card activities list. If I am black, my Amazon account has been already closed by Amazon. Even I am black, what is the legal justification that Purse take my BTC into its own pocket?
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:28:42
Purse.io survived by robbing fund from earners. Even the earners are black, what is the legit reason that Purse can take their fund into its own pocket?
