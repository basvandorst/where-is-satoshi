What sustainanility options could be implemented so that blockchain transaction fees and time don't skyrocket again if it goes to 20k+ again?

That's exactly the point the USD is stable because of its widespread adoption and regulation. The last total USD in circulation is 4 trillion in 2008 (probably much more today), meanwhile BTC has a market cap of 65 billion. Adoption and stability or growth go hand in hand and lately BTC hasn't been stable

I don't comment on this or any other bitcoin thread but I'll offer my perspective here. I was aware of bitcoin before most 10 years ago or so when it was a nascent project adopted by a small fringe of geeks. Back then I made the mistake of not recognizing that bitcoin had value and utility, instead I wrote it off as a tulip market that would eventually crash. When bitcoin exploded last year I thought at every step of the way that people would reach the conclusion that the bubble had to burst, and up until 20k more and more people thought otherwise and invested. I don't hate bitcoin, I hate the culture of greed and speculative investment it created. I don't hate hodlers, in fact I sympathize with those who lost savings that they perhaps didn't have to lose. I hate that like the housing bubble the people left holding the bill were mostly common people doing small trades.

Being the first is only valuable when the market is ignorant to alternatives. I would argue that the loss of % total crypto market cap that bitcoin has seen in the last month is evidence of that.

What is circumstances would lead to widespread BTC adoption?
