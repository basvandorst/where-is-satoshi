This was the first double-spend transaction (mined in block 1414411):
Our patched nodes ignored this invalid chain, but when the invalid chain got too long our pre 0.16.0 nodes went into Safe Mode. I had to restart them with -disablesafemode

The SEGWIT contract is a prediction future on whether or not BIP141 (more info), also known as Segregated Witness, will be activated on the longest Bitcoin chain by the expiry date (Dec 31, 2017, 12:00 UTC).
SEGWIT will settle at 100:
If BIP141 is activated during an “activation period” by the expiry date, and
The Bitcoin chain that activated SegWit must remain the Bitcoin chain with the largest hash power for 1,512 out of the following 2,016 blocks (75%). These 1,512 blocks must have passed by the expiry date.
SEGWIT will settle at 0 if the above conditions are not met.
The above conditions may be amended with notice at any time.

BitMEX was approached by him and after some due diligence we said we were unavailable. He still listed us as speakers because he's a scammer.
Here is a video of Andrew Williams promoting a get-rich-quick scam (bitcoins-millionaire.com):
