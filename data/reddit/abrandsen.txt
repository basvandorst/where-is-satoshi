Scambusters deserve to be rewarded for their effort.. Maybe you could incentivise scambusting somehow...

I agree with what you are saying! I also believe that it would self correct... 
It’s just that I hear this argument all the time...That the “minority” (by hash-power)
chain would die if (let’s just say a 75% majority) of miners where to go for a BU-hard-fork. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:11:10
No, that is not what I'm saying! The whole point of my post is to explain that miners have limited power..

I totally agree with your post! Blockstream deserve much more credit for the work they are doing!
I personally believe it’s fair to assume that developers who are employed by Blockstream are likely to own large private bitcoin fortunes, just due to the fact that they where very early into bitcoin.
This is pure speculation but each of them might own thousands or maybe tens of thousands of bitcoin. 
Do people really believe that these developers are willing to sacrifice the value of their own private fortunes out of pure loyalty to their employer? 
Do people really believe that they are deliberately crippling bitcoin to benefit their employer?
Or is it more likely that they are actually doing what they think is best for bitcoin?

Same question on Bitcointalk gave me the following answer from achow101:
No. In the case of a hard fork, there will be one block that causes the fork. This block is one that is invalid on the original chain but valid on the new chain, and is the first new block of the new chain. Because each block is related to the block before it, and that is related to the block before it, and so on and so forth, a block in the new chain that would otherwise be valid on the original chain will still be invalid on the original chain due to it having an invalid ancestor.

I expect bitcoin to give us more green energy by making wind turbines more cost effective. 
They can mine at night when there is lower marked demand for the product they produce; electricity, but their source of energy; wind is still available.
More cost effective wind turbines competes better with other sources of energy.
= More wind turbines 
= More green energy for all of us.

Have you ever heard about the relationship between supply and demand?
Lets be clear:
Miners are selling blockspace
Users are buying blockspace
So let us talk a little bit about housing instead..
What do you think would happen if the government gave everybody a house for free every 10th year?
What do you think would happen to the prices of real estate?
Do you think it will be easy to sell your house during the 9 years in between? 
Do you think people will be willing to pay good money for your house?

Miners have no control of Tx-fee price. The price is set by the market and is a result of supply and demand for blockspace.

As a non computer savvy person, my own experience is that the opening up of port 8333 was the hardest thing to figure out when installing my node. I got it open eventually, but it was not trivial. This might explain the high ratio between "non listening" v/s "listening" nodes
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:03:07
This can be under "Advanced settings" 
Anyway this is all wallet related functionality, so I guess anything is possible.. I'm just wondering why we don't have this already.. Is there any drawbacks that I didn't think of...?
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:43:11
This is off topic (and possibly a stupid question) but please help me understand: 
Why is it called: 
"non listening nodes" 
and not 
"listening only nodes" ? 
My understanding is that these are the nodes who are not forwarding transactions (?)
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:17:40
I believe those are 8 outgoing connections and zero incoming connections, correct? 
So the term "listening" applies to *connections* and not to blocks/transactions, correct?

You make many good points here, and I agree with all of them. But what I posted is actually worth reading. It's not written by CSW but by someone who is debunking him. He gives a very informative point-by-point description of the properties of Fully Validating Nodes. In my view that is valuable information that I havent seen elsewhere in a point-by-point format
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:57:18
Thank you! 
If I don't open port 8333, does this turn my node into a "non listening node" ? 
The term is confusing because the node obviously has to "listen" for new blocks...

Ok, so in that case... Is it important to maintain the "extrinsic value" of the blockspace?
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:57:52


“Value is also not price. Air has tremendous value (because breathe), price is zero”
Thank you for proving my point! That is exactly what I mean! 
If there is too much of something then the price becomes zero!
8 years from now the block reward will have dropped to only 3.125 btc/block.
If the price of blockspace is to low, the network will have a big problem at this point! 
@_date: 2016-10-17 18:36:12
It’s not only farming, for instance the media is also heavily subsidized in Norway…
10 years from now, it’s is not unthinkable that some governments will have a very positive attitude towards bitcoin.
We must remember that all governments consists of people, and some of those people will personally own bitcoin.. Suddenly they might want to support the local mining farm.. 
10 years from now the mining reward will have dropped to only 3.125 bitcoin per block. At that time, I will not be surprised if some well meaning government wants to subsidize its local mining industry.
I believe this will lead to negative consequences for the network. 
Those consequences will be even worse if blocks are not full.  
If the blocks are full:
Miners will simply fill up blocks with the transactions that pays the most in fees.
Users are competing for blockspace, and the price is determined by how much the users are willing to pay. 
This does not change if a government suddenly starts to subsidize its local mining farms
If blocks are not full:
Miners are competing to offer the lowest price for blockspace. They try to include as many transactions as possible while at the same time excluding those who pays too little.
The price is determined by how little the miners are willing to demand in fees.
If some of the miners suddenly gets a government subsidy, they can afford to offer a lower price for blockspace. Then there is no longer any reason for users to include a high fee, because a low fee will be accepted anyway. This will in turn effect everyone who is a miner, because the price of blockspace is reduced globally.

@_date: 2016-05-07 23:52:20
Thank you for the feedback!
How about using the median fee paid in the block.. If the the block is full and the median fee is above a certain threshold then the miner is allowed to extend the block size.
Using the median instead of the average or the total would make it harder for the miner to "cheat" by sending high fee transactions, wouldn't it?
