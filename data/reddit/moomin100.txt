‘Bits’ is more logical but it is already a word that means something else.

*Really* take your time. Disconnect this computer from the internet.
Winning the lottery bankrupts a lot of people. $0.5m is *a lot* and you could not be too paranoid about getting this wrong, but it’s also definitely not ‘infinite money’. Take serious care. Your neighbour may sue you and even win.
Think of learning about bitcoin as your job. Spend 300 hours learning before you touch that old laptop. *You cannot be too paranoid.*
Start by setting up a coinbase account and buy say 0.003 bitcoin and learn how to send it to a bitaddress.org paper wallet. Get your hands really dirty.
Once you can *confidently* program your own elliptic curves, and SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash functions and use them to mine, store and transact bitcoin, move on.
Next, go over to r/personalfinance r/investing and even r/wallstreetbets to get various different perspectives on investing. You should be comfortable making a DCF stock valuation. Learn how you to put $200 into a mutual fund or index tracker ETF.
Fully understand your tax obligations and speak to a financial advisor.

Does the lightning network add any/ take away any anonymity in transactions?

The number of people who *actually have* bitcoin (i.e. know their private keys) is very low. But I don't think that says much about *mass adoption*. Like it or not, there are evidently a lot of people 'holding' bitcoin on exchanges.

Is electricity, oil or gas typically cheaper for heating?

1 dollar cent ~= 1 bit.
I vote we pronounce μBTC ‘microbits’

Any love for kmBTC?

Call me old-fashioned, but isn’t this a comic strip not a meme?

Why, what do you do?

I think you may have slightly missed the question. Obviously there are large fees combining coins into an address. The question is whether, *once I have done that*, I incur more fees in my *next* transaction simply from having a bitcoin at an address that was acquired *from* lots of small transactions.

Unless you hand-write your private keys on pieces of paper and sign transactions on a computer without radioantennae.

Are you willing to sell?

Where do Electrum and Bitcoin Core publish transaction tokens?
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:34:10
Or just look at the ledger...

I guess that just shifts the question. Have they disclosed their intentions?
I know this isn't what you want to hear but I really do have good personal reasons and I am sticking with XBT Provider for this account.

Generally you're right. They are anonymous if you really really know what you're doing
