This is a shitpost

No problem!

I'd say ByBit,  Bitfinex, and Binance are all good for margin trading.

I'm not saying it's Bitmex's fault for people using leverage, but they definitely are manipulating to get liquidation fees. As far as I know, there are a few other options like ByBit, Bitfinex (though it doesn't give as high of a leverage), Binance (which has margin trading now), BitSeven, and Kraken.

At this point, I'm pretty sure Bitmex is a scam. They might seem legitimate due to the fact that they are a very popular exchange, but they are not as good as they seem. Bitmex is known for (though there isn't 100% solid evidence of this) manipulating the price of Bitcoin so they can collect liquidation fees, and make the most amount of money possible. Also Bitmex has many times had their servers "crash" at just the right time when their customers would actually profit on a position. Servers being down is not that uncommon of a problem, but this, combined with the fact that Bitmex has a lot of money that they can spend on better servers (but are supposedly not choosing to do so) seems very suspicious to me. I'm probably going to get downvoted into oblivion for this, but these are just my thoughts.

For anyone wondering, the coloured areas are the start/end of every reward halving

It contains all points, but I'm trying to find information from the start of Bitcoin as well

I'll try re-doing it with stock-to-flow!
