If it happens continually and is clearly the merchants fault for negligence or failure to communicate with the customer or false advertisement, the company will go under very quick and have a shit reputation. 
Personally, I think, there should be laws that regulate products or services and identify if they are doing what they say they will and providing what they say they will. However, if the consumer is negligent and doesnt read the disclaimers about a product or service, it is their own fault.
ProTip: You dont need to read the entire Terms of Use, just the billing section and the disclaimer.

Accidents happen all the time. I completely understand that something like that is devastating and I wish things like that could be completely avoided. Unfortunately that is just not realistic.
Banks can only get so much of someones money back, and because people know all they have to do is say the words 'fraud,' 'BBB,' 'Attorney General,' they abuse the system and it cost more money than it should and only makes banks profit.
Its hard to find a system that works for everyone.

Yes, there is always the possibility of fraud and fraud is usually pretty easy to detect. When somebody signs up for something and doesnt read what they are purchasing or just out right forgets about it and wants their money back from 6 months ago, is the consumers fault and the merchant can not be blamed. Although if the consumer complains enough, they'll get their $50 dollars back and the merchant is left paying fees.

Im surprised with the downvotes, considering the OP using the Shiba Inu jargon in the first paragraph.
