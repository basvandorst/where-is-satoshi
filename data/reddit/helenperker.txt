That is so predictable. They need to have the best programmers in order to avoid such attacks

That's hilarious, who they want to persuade that Bitcoin will be dead soon? 
I am sure their politics are buying now Bitcoins secretly

I have transferred a few times, very convenient, but it is possible maximum 500 euro

sounds like unreal, imho

Spam site? Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:59:24
So many scams right now.. what to do not to be deceived?

Let's see what the future brings for them)))

Soon Bitcoin will reach 20k usd and then even Russia will start supporting it. This is like the future looks like.

Your are absolutely true. Time will show us.

How long do they plan to create these Bitcoin clones? 
I don't actually consider them to get as much success as Bitcoin has. I'd better put all my money in Bitcoin either in these fragile coins

This site is the one with the fresh news about Bitcoin. No spam FYI. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:54:06
what's exactly? :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:45
The thing is it is impossible to predict it ...
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:27:50
Who knows? except Coinbase :) 
Let's see what this will bring :) and for how long
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:49:27
I think nobody understands Bitcoin, just pretends as if knows it but truly - not :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:12:09
So do you plan to get it while it drops, what if it goes under 11k then? So huge leaps
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:31
Do you plan to sell it then? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:59
What will you use? :)
