I am betting that the hodlers will make even more money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:32:20
I thought block chain is already completely secure against creating fake transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:49:51
Well it went down.  You dont have to worry no mo. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:09:36
That bitch!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:34:57
It was named as such. Coin.  Satoshi should have named it bittech. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:01
I moved about $1k and it cost $20
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:20:02
Money comes in -&gt; Price goes up. 
The market cap is about to triple. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:10:06
The entire cryptocurrency market is a bubble and a hoax. Don't ever buy in. Leave it to dreamers like me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:10
People all over the world are rushing to buy Bitcoin. Lololol.  To  Andromeda!!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:37:29
Some European family sold their house and cars and put the money in cryptocurrency in expectation of 400% gain by 2020.  In my opinion, they will get more than 400% in 2 years.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:48:03
No.  That's not how i would do it.   
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:36:07
If you spent 500 you would have 20 btc... at 25 each.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:46:44
I agree.  24/7 Is the keyword. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:23:01
Its just dumb because i have to buy btc or eth first to buy any other coins.  So if i dont want to pay tax i can own only btc or eth  from 2018 on.  Just stupid law.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:27:25
Hodl until $1,000,000
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:02:24
 Bitcoin will be the gold standard of all measures of value in the future. Petrol dollar will be in the past. 
Bitcoin is going to go up to 1 million dollars each.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:07:05
I bet all my cryptocurrency that there are exponentially more people kicking themselves for getting rid of their $.10 bitcoins than who became millionaires by hodling their $.10 bitcoins.   
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:40:15
Not gonna tell you how i would do it.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:19:08
Trolling. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:25:55
 congrats! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:28:34
If you are the seller and buyer you can manipulate the market with a lot of coins/shares.  Google it.  It is easy to do.  Easy to understand.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:32
Buy at the bottom.  And enjoy the ride up!
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:44
Heck. If i owned 200 bitcoins, i would be a millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:57:30
And yet some idiots try to use valuation on these coins. How do you put a price on a crypto currency other than the trading market value? You don't. IOTA to the Moon!!! BTC to $1,000,000!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:07
I would be surprised if it went up to 30K by midnight. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:02:10
A+ for effort.  lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:02:36
they are the early adoptees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:32
I would laugh so hard.. but would not be surprised. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:32:06
 can i use the same story to evade taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:59
Lol.  Is that Roger Ver?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:54:13
Bitcoin is going down now...13200
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:07:03
It makes sense.  So I would have to make a move right away after buying BTC or at least be conscientious about the price in and price out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:51:52
They have been saying that for 2 years.
Its like people said world is ending in y2k.
And they said again  world would end in dec of 2012. 
All BS
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:02:41
I dont have to go down to tent level living if i sold my house.  I could rent an apartment because i have a job with steady income.  But my wife would kill me before i see a penny of my $10M and Ferrari.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:16
You IDIOT!!!  I was only enlightened during thanksgiving this year.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:16:53
 tell them about the litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:23:15
Corrupt officials embezzled those bitcoins probably.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:00:27
Bitcoin transaction fee is ridiculously high. Buy litecoin instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:44
Shorting bitcoin is dangerous.  Even more so than daytrading it. 
I would never short bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:10:15
it is his public announcement how small his balls are.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:02:11
You could even lie that you added more coins when it dropped to 200!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:29:34
We don't count for 30% . We are less than 5%.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:23:54
I was thinking last night also.  $100 in btc in 2010 would be $10M today.  Fuuuuuuuudge!!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:41:44
Someone should have told me to sell the house and put the money in bitcoin and hold in 2010.  I would be retired already.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:15:53
 We just dodged one on 9/23/17.  I want not even aware. 
The next one is in 2020.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:04:02
Let's go to 20k
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:54:08
We will be using cryptocurrency by then. You won't need to sell to be rich.  You will be spending it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:04:45
No worries. Federal reserve will print more money. 
1 million dollars in 5 years will worth a lot less than 1 million now. Hence hodl bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:57:43
 binance shows 13050.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:30:30
Increase the number of numbers to guess?
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:12
My AMEX is being registered.
When I make a $200 transaction, it will show up as a purchase on my AMEX account, correct?
