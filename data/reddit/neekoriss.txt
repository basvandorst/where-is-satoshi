libertarians aren't anti government. the just believe the government should have a very limited scope. protection of private property, legitimate military defense (not empire building), criminal and civil courts, etc. are all valid functions of government

BCH is shooting up because just yesterday Bitmain posted the new batch of Antminers for sale and they only accept BCH as payment. Everyone wanting to buy miners is now suddenly rushing to sell bitcoin for BCH

I've ordered from bitcoin 4 times now and am pretty familiar with the process. I don't think OP is necessarily lying, but here's what probably really happened:
OP orders miners, pays the total amount up front in either crypto or bank transfer (back when they used to accept bank wires). OP can easily check order status by logging into his account on Bitmain's website. Two months later the miners ship. Once they reach the states UPS, fedex, or whichever company is shipping would call OP because he has to pay duties when importing products worth over $1500. They ask what the value of the miners are. OP says he doesn't have "invoices". However if he really needed an invoice he could easily view and print his order by logging into his bitmain account. On my small order they called, i told them what i bought it for, paid the duties, and no invoices had to be shown. perhaps US customs needs more proof on bigger order. For whatever reason, maybe a language barrier, maybe ignorance, OP can't provide invoices, doesn't pay duties (200 miners at about $50 a piece = $10,000 out of pocket) and the shipment is sent back to bitmain. once they arrive they are sold quickly to someone else. (they frequently sell out quickly and buyers usually have to order two months ahead of delivery).
when OP contacts bitmain he's super pissed, probably a bit rude. Bitmain at this point can either A. go out of pocket to ship him miners a they don't have in stock a second time or B. Say they delivered, delivery was refused, and there are no refunds. They're both to blame
