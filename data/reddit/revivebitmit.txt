I'll surely do! ;)

I have heard about the same things. Probably they are all true. They literally grew too fast and started monetizing very late. They wouldn't have expected it to be this good.

I just bought a gift card, and it worked pretty quick. Delivered in just 2 hours! :D
Looking forward to buy more soon!
Good luck!

Somebody please help!

I totally doubt that. Based on the account history, seems like it's just a user who snatched that name to promote his own items. Not taking the risk. Thanks for the heads up anyways!
EDIT: He was able to confirm his identity somehow. But, he seems to be inactive now.

Yes, today is 15th June. :P
Edit: In my timezone at least.

$0.50 Worth it.

He was last active April 18, 2014, any other way to contact him/her?

Sorry, I forgot to mention, I have contributed to OpenBazaar in the past. :)
Bitmit v2.0 used part of that tech.

Hey! I'll try support2013 I suspected it was offline because of multiple reasons, one being that it's there from a LONG time. People usually tend to stop checking at emails after such a long time.
Also, I am kind of preventing to send email to random addresses like the 2 gmail addresses you wrote. That's because I want to keep my conversations as closed as possible. :)
This is surely the most informative response, thanks!

The wrong with Thai Bhat is that, it's Thai Bhat.

Gyft has no eBay optio..
@_date: 2014-06-15 11:40:19
Yeah. I LOVED IT! :D

Don't worry, I am surely planning more decentralization into the system. ;)
I want to revive Bitmit, in form of Bitmit v2.0. It surely has to be Bitcoin worthy. ;)

I made new code by myself, it's functional and perfect. I am looking for Bitmit owners so that I can do this with them. Bitmit had trust, which I don't wanna break. 
Although, I am open for offers, anybody interested to build such a thing with me, I am here, shoot me a PM, we can talk further. :)

Bitmit was the best community for Bitcoin buy sell. People still remember it. And if the creators are there with the new thing, they'll have trust too.
I loved Bitmit, I have sold quite a few things there. I loved it. There's no reason why someone would not want it to be back. I am already building v2.0 from quite some time and as I get to the creators of Bitmit, I'll get a few more devs (and probably investors) and make it live, with the original creators most probably.
