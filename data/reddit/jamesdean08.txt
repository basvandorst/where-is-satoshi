it's called dielectric fluid; basicly conducts heat but not electricity (to a certain point)

you can boil it at 34c, doesn't mean you'll cook your chicken with it.

no, if you're at the point of changing the state of the liquid; it's doing fucking great

it's exponential, it's the literal "you tell 2 friends, and they tell 2 friends" total crypto marketcap only accounts to 1/3 of 1% of the world economy; this growth is just the beginning

I don't pretend to be an expert, but i do believe we'll see a ton more market cap, definite growth;  the word bitcoin is now something that most people have heard of, and more millionaire stories are coming out on the regular regarding crypto; aside from that we now have more and more business oriented growth (such as the square cash beta) It just feels to me the way the stock market felt when it started, crazy growth, tons of FUD and then exponential growth
