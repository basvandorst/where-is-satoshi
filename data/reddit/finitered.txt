I woukd think that BTC price would struggle to reach $10,000 let alone $100,000 at any point before the block reward phase of mining concludes. BTC is capable of spiking to thousands but long term sustainability at these prices is just not going to happen whilst miners are dumping thousands of new coins into the economy every day. Once this behaviour ebbates I think we will see phenomenal price in reases - assuming BTC is still around and the miners fees / worth are substantial enough to justify continued hashing on the bitcoin network.

'Tim Berners-Lee' is 'the man' who is most commonly associated with creating the modern internet (he actually created the first implementation of the HTTP protocol on which the internet as we know it is now based) however the Internet's origins date further back to CERN networking large numbers of computers to share data and research materials. Let's just hope that in 40 years time people remember Satoshi nakamoto's name ;)

Far better for a benign entity to discover and report an issue than a malicious one who then uses it to exploit the network.

One of the reasons England is so pro Bitcoin - we can all see there is a massive problem (+ banks seem to get fined daily for various infractions/scams/losses etc..) - but glad I live in such a Bitcoin friendly climate :)

When not involved it's hard not to have a sneaky peak (Bitcoin's version of rubbernecking)
