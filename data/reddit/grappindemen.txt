I didn't invest in bitcoins. I'm stating a fact, though. *You* argue, essentially, that since bitcoins are nothing but sequences of bits, they can melt away like ice. *I'm* arguing that bitcoins are mathematical constructs, of which the supply can be mathematically proven to follow a certain curve.
I suggest you study what bitcoins are, before you give an opinion about it.

No, the advice is perfectly valid as it was.
If you habitually take risks with an destructive outcome (a loss you're not willing to take), then the destructive outcome will eventually (in the mathematical sense, i.e., in the limit) happen. The destructive outcome is worse than just the loss of the money, but includes loss of future value. Although the expected value may have been positive, the opportunity cost draws the otherwise positive risk into the negative. *That's* what the advice is actually saying. And it's equally valid for gambling (typically expected negative gain) as for investments/speculation (typically expected positive gain).

Nor does a piece of paper, a piece of metal, or a small letter in the mailbox containing some additions and subtractions. The fact that you can acquire goods and services makes a currency, and you can get goods and services with it. The fact that it's a mathematical construct only serves to guarantee that nobody can tamper with them (or at least that it's extremely hard to do so).

You *can* make more, that's what bitcoin mining is. But clearly the increase of demand (due to extra attention) will be much larger then the increase of supply (due to extra mining).

Although cryptographically, the number of bitcoins can't exceed 21m, that doesn't mean that 21m is therefore the absolute max. If all bitcoins are mined, the fixed supply will harm the bitcoin economy (ask any country in the late 19th century and early 20th century how nice their deflation caused by a stagnant gold supply was). Therefore, someone will create a bitcoin++ with a larger (potential) supply, causing the normal bitcoin to slowly devaluate. It's simple economics. Although that doesn't imply that bitcoins can't be a solid investment now.

I know I'm stretching the definition, but mathematical law. The size of the supply is regulated by maths, not people. Which means that you don't need to *trust* the issuer (as the issuer does not control the supply).

You couldn't be more wrong. The US currency has no real backing, most is electronic, in the bad sense. A bank could just add a zero here and there, and as long as they don't get caught, they'll get away with this (but they will get caught, of course). Electronical counterfeiting is trivial. Bitcoins are based on cryptography. You cannot counterfeit a bitcoin, as it's mathematically impossible. Similarly, the growth of the supply of bitcoins is fixed. Again by mathematics. To create a bitcoin, you need to solve a (mathematically) hard problem. If you know the computational power invested in bitcoins, you know the speed of the increase of the supply.

People will want to buy bitcoins, to buy products with (especially since you can freeze assets, and unlock them, they're ideal for internet trades). So some institutes will start selling bitcoins. They, in turn need to acquire bitcoins. Such an institute is effectively a currency exchanger.

It's the all important rule of risk taking. Be it gambling, investing, or any other risk. Don't put something on the line, that you can't afford to lose.
Since common sense seems to be lacking with you, let's use actual mathematics to show the validity of this statement.
If you know what an 'opportunity cost' is, then the math is straightforward: the opportunity cost of a destroyed bankroll is huge.
In case you don't know what opportunity cost is: You expect to have a (almost risk free) gains on your capital. If you take a big risk with your capital, you not only risk to lose the capital, but also the future capital gains.

A lot of this. The Fed did not crank on the money press, they merely issued some cheap short term loans to increase overall liquidity (which is what the banks were afraid to do).

And at the same time completely destroy liquidity, making investments grind to a halt, and therefore the economy grind to a halt.
