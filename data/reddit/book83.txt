Coinbase has two apps for your phone.  One is more about buying/selling,

You can have both apps running in about 2 minutes.

Coinbase has two apps.  One is to access the their buy/sell marketplace (the standard app).
The "merchant" app creates QR codes like you said.
Problem will be converting to fiat.
At the end of the day, you can go into the standard app and sell your bitcoins.  This will lock in your prices at the end of each day, not exposing you to very much volatility -but- I think it will take at least 3 business days for the fiat to be in your bank account.  You are not subject to price movements those 3 days (your sell price was locked in) but yow still have to wait.
If you need a better solution you will probably have to incur some setup costs and use a service like BitPay

It seems like every new coin or even the non-altcoins still have some grand mining scheme.
But wouldn't we be better served to back new coins with bitcoin and skip mining altogether? ...because its starting to not make sense.
I think this idea will basically happen overnight.  Coinbase could issue me a coin that a starbucks could trust in 1 milisecond, and Coinbasese internal accounting would be backing that transaction with real bitcoin.
Now you can use bitcoin in retail, Starbucks doesn't have to trust me, it just has to trust my bank.

Stores do not take their cash to the bank every time they sell a donut, they go to the bank once a day.  You don't need to check the bitcoin network on every transaction, you just have to do all the accounting at once.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:36:28

yeah the price tanks in that scenario, but bitcoin would live through that easy, and it would be on much firmer footing.
There would be less questions about the regulation of bitcoin, because once it was made illegal than that would settle that.

I can solve it in a few words.  Faster coins with no mining, 1-1 BTC conversion.   You accept a few of these coins like you would accept Visa or Mastercard.  Then at the end of the day all these alts are converted to BTC.  This is like depositing at the bank once a day, not every time someone buys Skittles.

@_date: 2014-02-20 18:44:30
So you skipped over "sound money" as a quality that makes bitcoin useful.  You also have to realize that the Bitcoin network is peer to peer and there will be more apps than just currency.  I find a decentralized network that connects me directly to someone else with no 3rd party to be incredibly useful and I am willing to support it by buying BTC.
Am I speculating?  Not realy, I plan to spend and invest my bitcoins in the bitcoin economy, my gainsor losses in USD is starting to feel irrelevant and I expect that sentiment to spread.  USD is prentend money after all, and government uses it as a tool to leech off of society.

Everytime we look at their balance sheet they have liabilities (lost bitcoin) but they also have a lot cash.

It feels like we are eating shit right now.  But this what life is like for regular people too.
Instead of worrying about exchanges, a neighbor of yours is worrying just as much about something that could be a made-up fantasy, or it could be real life shit that is 2x more serious than anything we are talking about.

Like many, I used bitcoin before I thought of it as in investment.
Even as long as 1 year ago I remember knowing that Mt. Gox should be avoided.
I do have sympathy for those that lost money.   Maybe they knew they should withdraw, but they got used to their software, people don't want to change.  I understand that and it could happen to any of us.

That is true but our whole society is made of criminals, and the ones with institutionalized power are the worst ones.
History will look back at these growing pains as speed bumps, but they seem like large events right now because we are living through them.
The free market will regulate criminal behavior, and over time fraud and theft will be less and less common.  Until then, the behavior we seen in the bitcoin community as a whole, even accounting for all the thefts and accusations, is less criminal overall then dealing with regulated legacy institutions in our everyday lives.

See I was a skeptic too until people kept complaining about bitcoin wealth inequality.  Capitalists create value and society pays them for it, there is nothing wrong with that.
When you see a 20 year-old become a bitcoin millionaire, its easy to point to it and say it's odd or it's unfair.  But bitcoin didn't create the economy it is disrupting.
See the real wealth inequality is in the traditional economy, bitcoin millionaires are just a side effect of THAT screwed up economic system.
It's something easy to see and point too, but what we can't see is how similar inequalities are fostered by the system everyday from the top down.
Bitcoin is a tiny peek into that world
tl:dr. There is nothing unsettling about people making money off of bitcoin

I used Bitcoin QT this week.  There is a dropdown menu to encrypt the wallet, this is where you create your private key.  That's it.  It also lets you backup the wallet in one-click.

Send me her picture, I will think about her a little bit for you.

I would bring them unloaded.  In the unlikely event someone finds them and asks questions, they will literally be just metal tokens with no digital value.  
Then before the conference load them with the hologram stickers.

I was wondering what happens if you lose your phone?  I have recently 2 fa 'd everything, but I still don't know what would happen if I lose my phone or it stops working?

There are more attractive customers and workers at Target.

Because Zlatan won't be there, so its not worth watching.  :P

Sounds legit

Would you rather have a statist lawyer and an experienced government propagandist?   
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:21:46
There is a long tradition of local currencies being legal.  And California has precedent on this as well.

 You guys rock.  Lets repeat that they have a working iOS app too.
I still see threads asking for iPhone solutions.

Bitcoin needs a business association, like a BBB, and to get a good rating the businesses would have to meet high accounting standards and transparency.   You guys could be in a position to that, and you could probably make a lot of money 
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:45:07
It will kill the price but people will want it more (after the market clears).  The next bull run will have 1 huge advantage - Nobody will be wondering if the government will ban bitcoin...  (it already has).
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:07:11
Ahh no but I think the price goes down and we have to start buying in cash.  I look forward to it personally.  If the.government bans bitcoin I think we will get these big 10,000 or 100,000 per bitcoin predictions come true, but it would probably go to 50 first.  
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:09:01
Yep, it is.  Learn 2 virtuous cycle of economic growth.   It starts with savings.

So bitcoin is not a company?

Don't listen to him.  Bitcoin is the currency of the world today, currency of the moon tomorrow.

Need to educate people how bad the virtual currency USD is, without being too harsh or libertarian sounding 
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:11:05
So you are talking about sex workers that can't get access to merchant cc processing.  Yea, I imagine that could be difficult.

Options are just a legalized betting book, nothing innovative or important about it
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:25:34
Yeah I would think you could write off an almost unlimited amount of bills.  You aren't required to be profitable. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:36:53
This is actually a good ruse.

maybe this is  Karpeles and he is only .02 from being solvent.

Is this a joke?

They also recommend just using it for everyday spending money, not a storage wallet.

Exactly, why would an exchange need a money transmitters license?
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:34:30
Yeah because people write articles about him and stuff.  Unlike OP.
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:19:36
Wait he did inherit or start with $100,000 (inflation adjusted).  
He also lived through a great economic boom and the financialization of the stock market. 
He has a fantastic career, but he is still a product of his circumstances.

I would like to see proof as well.  In fact if Joe Rogan gets paid by any guests I would like to know. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:58:13
You're going to need to change some over to fiat to pay your bills.  I would rather hire Bitpay than create any headache for myself.  
If you are looking to hold some coins, I would assume they could arrange that.
Jeez I should be on salary for this post.

It's obviously a natural fit.  
No one wants to send their credit card info to scammy porn sites or live cams.

I always wondered why they didnt source rips from the community, possibly pay for high view rips.   Expand library instantly.
