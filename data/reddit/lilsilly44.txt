It's a popular venue. But I will assure you that our jerky is the best

Our primary priority is to make our name known. We enjoy making delicious beef jerky and want to share the love with the public. For a limited time we want to offer samples for people to try. Asking solely for a  fair donation to help with the costs of production and shipping.

The difference between our jerky and the mass produced Sasquatch jerky is the quality and effort taken. Sure the store bought stuff is relatively inexpensive, however, what you're getting is far from amazing. You won't find the McDonald's value menu on homemade quality beef products here. Ultimately you get what you pay for. Now since we are in the production stages and we are confident that we will beat out the competition, we are offering our beef jerky at reasonable rates for the Bitcoin family. What do you consider to be a fair asking price?

Shipping to anywhere within the continental U.S. is $5. That's the flat rate shipping cost via the postal service. Our website is still under construction but the site url is:  Once the website is completed there will be an online shipping tool. In the meantime you can pm me your info. If you are interested I can send you our Bitcoin address for payment.
