The current network hash rate is equivalent to at least 14 billion PC/GPUs.    This is simply calculated by using 0.1 gigahash as the average hash rate for a PC/GPU and taking the current network hash rate as 1,400,000,000 gigahash.
With say 2 billion PCs in the world the Bitcoin network is far better at mining Bitcoin than all the worlds PCs.
And so it should be.  Hashing is all a Bitcoin miner can do.  A single modern Bitmain S9 miner is equal to at least 100,000 normal PCs at mining Bitcoins.

If people really thought Bitcoin would go to $1,000 they would be buying bitcoin with every dollar they could borrow.  At the moment people seem to expect it to stay in the $550 to $600 range.

This transaction is 225 bytes with a 226 satoshi fee.  It is as close to being treated as a zero fee transaction as you can get.  
It is within one satoshi of being below the minimum relay fee. (minrelaytxfee 0.00001/kB).
It confirmed OK after 12 hours.

All good. It has two confirmations.  There was a 55 minute delay after you created your transaction before the next block was found.

Extremely unlikely.  A few things stop it being a disaster.
1) China is also a big creator of Bitcoin transactions.  You would have to assume China also stops Bitcoin transaction creation meaning less Bitcoin transactions.  See for example.
2)  Fees would rise so presumably this would also result in transaction volumes dropping.
In summary transactions would still go through even if there were bottlenecks.  Then after say 4 weeks everything would return to normal.

Transactions take a variable time.  It depends on the fee you pay, the byte size of your transaction and how fast blocks are being found. 
1) Blocks are found each 10 minutes on average with a Poisson distribution.  This means 10% of the time you have to wait at least 20 minutes, and a couple of times a week the wait is over an hour.  In the last 1.5 hours only 3 blocks were found.
2) How quickly your transaction gets in a block depends on the fee and the size of your transaction.  It is based on a cost per byte for your transaction. See  for typical fees.
If you want us to look at why there is a delay, enter the Transaction ID and we can see what is happening.

Antminer S3 is only OK for a hobbyist who just doing it for fun and does not aim to cover their costs.  The S3 is totally obsolete.  Its advantage is that it is quieter and draws less power than the very noisy S5 and S7.
The S3 draws about 340 Watts.  You can expect to spend between 25 and 50 dollars a month on electricity per miner depending on your electricity cost.  Your electricity cost will be several times higher than what you earn in bitcoins so only run one S3 even if you buy two.  See

This transaction seems to be 10 months old.  The question really should be, why is this transaction still around,  and not long ago deleted from mempools.  
It consists of ninety five 0.0001BTC inputs and five 0.0001 BTC inputs with a fee of 1 satoshi/byte.  Fee is 15000 satoshi, a tenth of what blockchain.info expects.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:44:48
The dollar value of the transaction is irrelevant.
"Maximum small inputs" is possibly because you had a large number of small inputs.  Presumably your transaction is a physically large transaction with dozens of very small inputs.  The fee is based on the transaction size, not its value.
If you give the transaction Id we can give more information.
Also the node timeout for transactions is generally 72 hours, not 24 hours.

One way of looking at mining is that a miner is a device for turning electricity into Bitcoin.  
You basically get a small amount of Bitcoin for performing trillions of calculations.  This requires electricity.

The current price stability can be taken as a reflection of current opinion.  Bitcoin has traded in the same band for the past 3 months and is still below the levels of late December.  So there does not seem to be much speculation on a rapid price change.

It should confirm within the next 24 hours.   
The system will try for up to 72 hours.  After that nodes will start dropping the transaction.
Your Bitcoin will not be lost.  In the worst case you will be able to resend with a higher fee. 
You have paid a fee of 2 Satoshi/Byte which is quite low.  See  for expected delivery times.
I will leave it to someone more experienced with cell phone wallets to comment on wallets.

Just a minor comment on "When halving happens if the demand remains constant and the supply is halved?".
The supply is not halved.  It is the rate of increase in supply that is halved.   
Currently the rate of increase in the number of Bitcoins is around 8% per year. The rate of increase will decline to about 4% per year.  The supply will be 15,750,000 bitcoins at the halving and grow by about 4% in the next year.

It is quite normal.
Blocks are found every 10 minutes on average with a poisson distribution.
There is a 38% chance that no block will be found in any 10 minute interval and a 0.3% chance that no block will be found in one hour.  So expect an interval of an hour or longer each couple of days on average.

The S7 and S9 are noisy and heat producing.  The S7 and S9 both use 1400-1500 Watts so generate a stack of heat. Both are noisy - think vacuum cleaner running.  The PSU also really requires a 220V power supply.
The Antminer R4 is the quieter version of the S9, uses slightly less power, and is the only one you would consider running in a bedroom.   The R4 is about to go on sale, cost about $1,000 plus $300 for 120V/220V PSU  (plus shipping, customs etc).

My guesses
1) The halving should rationally not affect the Bitcoin price.  The number of Bitcoins mined each month is small in terms of the total bitcoins in circulation.   Bitcoins mined each month equal only 0.3% of Bitcoins already in circulation. 
75% of all Bitcoins that will ever be created will already be in circulation.
But that does not mean the price will not rise.  If people expect it to rise it will.
2) The difficulty will fall slightly.  28nm miners (S7,A6) will become uneconomic.  This will give a drop of say 10-20% in mining difficulty/network hash rate.
3) Large scale miners running 14/16 nm miners will still be profitable although their profit margin will fall.  They will continue to slowly add miners.
4) Sales of 14/16nm miners to the general public will start as manufactures will no longer be dumping them all into their own mining farms.

Saying "Fastest possible fee is $0.04" is slightly wrong.
The priority depends on the transaction size as well as the fee.  Priority is calculated by dividing the physical transaction size by the fee.
A fee of $0.04 would be OK for a single input and output.  But would not work well on a physically large transaction with many inputs and outputs.

Your initial transaction had a fee of only 225 Satoshi. You must at least pay the minimum relay amount to guarantee that nodes relay your transaction.
This is currently 0.00001 BTC or 1,000 Satochi for a &lt;1K transaction (minrelaytxfee).
It is possible your transaction is not being relayed by all nodes and may be ignored by miners. 
Your wallet should have automatically inserted at least the relay fee.
If you want fast throughput I suggest you include a fee of at least 20 Satoshi per byte if you want faster transactions. Your wallet should automatically provide a reasonable fee.
I hope you included at least the relay fee when you resent the transaction.

You need to give references to the source of your information and definitions of what 'illegal' means. Does 'illegal' mean banned?
You have a large number of countries where Bitcoins are 'illegal'.  Yet all these countries are listed under localbitcoins.  
Lots of countries have restrictions on money laundering or on the use of money.  But that is not the same as making Bitcoin 'illegal'. 
For example Ecuador is commonly quoted as banning Bitcoin but in fact "the law makes no direct reference to Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency and includes provisions allowing for the use of multiple modes of payment." 
As far as I know there is no country where having or using Bitcoins is banned. You just have to work within the normal financial laws of the country.  The only possible exception is North Korea.

A comment on why daily difficulty adjustments would not work well.
With a Block each 10 minutes on average there are 144 blocks in a day and 2016 in a fortnight.
The blocks are found randomly with a poisson distribution. This means in an period there may be more or less blocks found than expected. The standard deviation varies as the square root of the number of blocks.
Over a day the deviation would be around sqrt(144) or 12 blocks. This is about 8% so if a new difference was found each day the difference would be more than 8% in error 30% of the time. It would really fluctuate.  This is why daily adjustments would be a problem.
With 14 days the deviation is around the sqrt(2016) blocks or 44 blocks or 2%. So the fortnightly deviation is only in error by about 2%.
Even if the actually network hashing rate never changed we would frequently see difficulty changes as wide as 2% each fortnight and larger swings every now and again.  Difficulty changes are only accurate to about 2%.

Hard to say.  It depends on the transaction.
You could say that you get a 75% saving on the signature and the signature represents about 40% of the transaction.  So say a 0.4 * 0.75 = 30% saving in fees.
But a Segwit transaction is about 10% larger than a legacy transaction.  So say very roughly a 20% to 30% saving in fees after taking the increase in transaction size into account.
Just rough figures.  Interested to see if any simulations have been run.

Low fee transactions are being dropped from their mempool.
It looks as if the site is running with around the default 300 MB mempool.  Once the mempool has reached its size limit (-maxmempool option), and a new higher-fee transaction is accepted, the lowest fee transactions are dropped to clear space.
Because of fragmentation this happens when the pool has about 150 MB of data with the default 300 MB pool.

The graph you gave is with a small mempool size, using default values.  This size mempool drops low fee transactions at about 140 MBs due to memory fragmentation.  If you look you will see it has almost no transactions under 100 sat/byte.

There are two areas where Dogecoin and Bitcoin differ.
1) Bitcoin, even if unloaded, is not instantaneous. It has a block solve rate averaging 10 minutes, compared to Dogecoin's 1 minute.
Statistically blocks are solved randomly (with Poisson distribution).  10% of the time it will take 20 plus minutes even if there is no-one using the network.  A delay of an hour between blocks is likely every few days.
So Bitcoin was never intended to be instantaneous.  You can argue about 1 minute vs 10 minute for block solve time, but 10 minutes is what Bitcoin has.
2) Bitcoin carries 10 to 20 times more transactions than Dogecoin.  Bitcoin, like Dogecoin,  prioritizes transactions based on the fee and transaction size.  If heavily loaded you need to set the appropriate fee.  
See for example  for typical delays compared to fees.  Use the appropriate fee and your transaction will be in the next block.

What miners do makes no difference.  
Basically a block is found/formed every 10 minutes on average and can hold about 2,000 to 3,000 transactions.
This means bitcoin is limited to about 5 to 7 transactions a second irrespective of miners.   This is what keeps fees high.

Schnorr signatures will reduce the size of the blockchain database but may have minimal other effects. 
Schnorr does not greatly change what can be fitted into the 1MB Segwit base block, which remains the limiting factor for throughput.  
The fee reduction may also not be as large as expected as the signature transaction fee is already discounted with Segwit by 75%. 
Segwit seems to have removed part of the case for Schnorr signatures.

The difference is important to anyone who has sent a transaction with under 100 sat/byte who expects it to eventually confirm.  They can but hope miners user mempools larger than the default.

In the Bitcoin world perhaps his parent/guardian should have set up the account and then given him access to the account.  Ultimately the account needs to be in the name of someone 18 or over.

Segwit slightly improves throughput and fees but is not a magic bullet.  
It gives effectively larger blocks, say 1.8 MB but at the cost of about a 10% increase in transaction size.  Segwit adds overhead.
It lowers fees for Segwit users because it gives a fee discount on the signature part of the transactions, say a 30% fee savings.  This is to encourage people to move to Segwit but ceases to be useful once everyone is on Segwit.
The combination of the above changes are useful but even if everyone used Segwit now we would still have high fees.
Segwit was largely created for other reasons, in particular malleability fixes.

You must have really cheap electricity (5 cents or lower per kWh) to make it worth while to be powering up the S2s.
An Antminer S2 runs at 1 Terrahash.  This would earn you about .003 BTC per day per S2 or a maximum total of 0.009 BTC per day for all three.  Take a little off for fees and perhaps a lower hash rate. (

You may also be overestimating the value of the Bitcoins generated by miners, especially after the halving. By then 75% of all Bitcoins will have been generated.
Even if every miner agreed to hold every mined bitcoin for a month, say 54,000 Bitcoins, it will still represents less than the amount of Bitcoin moved in a day.  One months mining will equal about 0.3% of all Bitcoins in circulation.  Miners secretly holding every Bitcoin for a month may not even be noticed.

It is hard coded into the bitcoin protocol.  If blocks are found faster then every 10 minutes the mining 'difficulty' is automatically raised slowing mining.  Similarly if over 10 minutes the mining difficulty is automatically lowered.
The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.   This is about every 14 days.  
To change the way this adjustment works would require the majority of all miners (nodes?) to agree on the change.  This is almost impossible.

At a transaction fee off about one cent per confirmed transaction.
Anything greater that about 2 sat/byte goes straight through.

Time frame depends on what fee you paid and the size of your transaction.  
A 4 cents fee (0.0001BTC) transaction should go through within a couple of blocks for the average transaction (&lt;1K bytes).

Bitcoin mining is done on specialised hardware using dedicated ASIC chips.  General purpose CPUs are far too slow. You will earn almost nothing.   One S9 Antminer (13 TH/s) is equal to tens of thousands of general purpose servers.  The older Power 7 does say 7 Mh/s. An Antminer S9 miner does about 13,000,000 Mh/s,  
It is possible to mine for some coins using graphic cards. Your best bet may be to research what you can mine on the graphics cards.

Agreed.  One aspect is that there are currently about 65 million unspent bitcoin amounts (UTXO set).  
If you wanted to move all the unspent amounts to SegWit transactions at once it would be  take the entire bitcoin network 2 to 3 weeks.   
Obviously the process will be spread out and happen gradually as transactions occur.  Some unspent amounts will never be moved.

As you probably realise the fee at 64 sat/byte was far too low.  A more suitable fee for fast processing would have been around 300 to 500 sat/byte, say 5 to 8 times higher.
This is a very large transaction (13,957 bytes).

Nothing unusually about the block.  
Blocks with just the block reward transaction occur when on one block is found soon after another.  When a block is found it takes miners a couple of seconds to adjust their mempool and build a new block.  During this time the miners look for an empty block.
Also block times are only approximate as CPU times are often out by a few seconds.  It is not unusual for later blocks to have earlier times than previous blocks.  The protocol just requires the times to be within 2 hours.

@_date: 2018-01-12 01:48:29
Not correct. You are looking at transactions which are waiting for processing, not those processed.
If you divided transaction fees for blocks, by the block size you get about 300-400 sat/byte for average processed transactions.

It is unlikely there will be a major drop in fees anytime soon.  Segwit helps slightly as it increases block size to say 1.8 MB.  But this will not give a major drop in fees.  Bitcoin Core 0.16 will assist with Segwit use and should be out in the next few months.
Lightning is still some time away.  Software always take longer to develop and test than expected and no-one is going to put a $250 billion dollar industry at risk due to coding errors (remember the DAO).  I would say 2019 for Lightning.

Depends on the physical size of the transaction (number of inputs and outputs).  Priority is in satoshi/byte.

1) As well as the blockchain the miners keep a separate database of unspent transactions called the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO).  So miners just check their UTXO to find unspend transactions.
2) Yes.  Only valid transactions can be included in a block.  Otherwise the block will be rejected by nodes.
3) The merkel tree does not require an even number of transactions.  The last transaction is hashed with itself.
4) Miners can run their own code.  You could code your own.  The only requirement is that whatever the miner generates must be acceptable to nodes and other miners, otherwise the block will not propagate.

“No matter what the price of Bitcoin, you cannot lose money by mining Bitcoin. Let’s say the price drops to $2000, everybody gets out and the difficulty rate drops to zero and you’re cranking out millions of coins per day.”
"You cannot lose money by mining Bitcoin" - want to bet

"difficulty rate drops to zero" - not going to happen
"cranking out millions of coins per day" - how, there are only 1,800 new coins mined per day, and even less if the difficulty is dropping.

Suspect traders keep large amounts on an exchange.  So a trader's transactions will only exist as internal transactions within an exchange.
The blockchain will not show these trades.  It will only show when a trader/whale initially loaded their account and when they finally withdraw from the exchange.
To some extent the exchanges, and Bitpay and Coinbase, already operate as a second layer on the bitcoin network, providing internal low fee instantaneous off network transactions.

The given figures seem correct.  Lightning networks are limited by how often people need to move bitcoin to the main chain.  The number of main bitcoin chain transactions remains at about 15 million per month.
The assumption is that lightning channels will stay open for long periods and channels will be interconnected.  So people may only rarely move bitcoin to the main chain, or open or close channels. Whether this is the case will only be known once lightning is in common use.

That number means little.  It is the speed transactions are being generated.  This can be any number and changes minute by minute over the day.
The rate they are added to the block chain is around 4-5 per second (2400 per block).  If transactions are being generated faster than about 4 to 5 per second the number of transactions waiting to confirm grows (mempool).

Basically the fee is to buy physical space on the blockchain.  The miners have 1MB of space available per block and you are buying space in that block.  
The physical size of your transaction is what determines the transaction cost.  The value of the transaction is not relevant. 
Note - SEGwit is an increase in block size to eventually an average of 1.7 MB per block.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:35:06

The Segwit fee should be around 30% lower depending on signatures.   The discount only applies to the signature. 
So a $10 fee should fall to around $7.   It is not a large saving.
The main advantage of SEGwit is it allows blocks to hold about 70% more transactions.

$7 fee is about 55000 satoshi so a 544 sat/byte implies your transaction was about 100 bytes in size.
This is too small for a normal transaction with at least one input and output.

Segwit increases throughput by about 70% without changing the basic way bitcoin works.
Lightning is some time away (2019?),  and is a much more complex change.   In theory it allows very high volumes of transactions.   It is still a little unclear how it will work in practise.  
For example with lightning channels the receiver of the bitcoin needs to be online at the time of the transfer.  This is different to bitcoin where you can transfer even if the receiving address wallet is offline.  It is also unclear if lightning will lead to more or less centralisation.  One possibility is the network ends up as a small number of large nodes linked by channels.  It will be very interesting to see what appears.

Same as now.  The borrower pays back more bitcoin than they initially borrowed.  That way the lender has an incentive to loan their bitcoin to the person rather than HODL their bitcoin.
Borrowing for anything is likely to be quite expensive as the borrower has to repay the loan with bitcoins that are worth more (deflation) plus the interest.

Also the article appears confused on battery storage.  A battery capable of providing 122 Megawatts for say 15 hours does not exist.  It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.   
Possibly the author is confusing energy storage (MWh) with how fast you can get energy in and out of the battery (MW).

It happens a couple of times a week when one block is found within a couple of seconds of another.  After a block is found it takes a short time for miners to readjust mempool and build a new block.  During this time they mine looking for a block with just the single miners fee transaction.

So you cannot transfer funds unless the receivers lightning wallet is also online at the same time.

By default when a mempool gets full low fee transactions are dropped.  The default jochen mempool is full.
Jochen also provides a display derived from a larger mempool.  Just click on the "Large Mempool" tab at the top of the screen and you will see all transactions.
Note - there is is no central bitcoin mempool.  Every mempool is different depending on pool parameters and when pool was last restarted.  The default mempool is 300 MB (maxmempool) but this cannot hold 300 MB of transactions due to fragmentation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:02:55
Difficult to know.
Mempool default size is 300 megabytes.  Once space runs tight low fee transactions are automatically dropped.  This is possibly happening now as mempool gets fragmented.  To get over 300,000 transactions you would need a big mempool.
@_date: 2018-09-13 19:47:18
You need to say what your aim is.  
For example if you have customers wanting to pay in bitcoin you could simply use Coinbase Commerce or a similar service and they will handle the conversion to fiat.  Your customers will see a bitcoin transaction but your iinternal systems will see a fiat transaction making integration to your existing system easy.  This is the way most businesses handle bitcoin.
If you want to actually receive bitcoin it gets more complex as you will need to treat the bitcoin transaction as a foreign currency in your accounting systems, so you can handle bitcoin value changes and keep the tax people happy.

One big issue with country-wide Bitcoin adoption by merchants is that bitcoin is far more volatile than most local currencies.  This is why most businesses that accept bitcoin still price their products in local currency and immediately convert received bitcoins to local currency. Long term import/export contracts would be almost impossible if locked in bitcoin in one country but not in another.
You would also need to make bitcoin/lightning wallets as easy to use as a tap-and-go credit card.
Throughput may also be an issue, depending on how everything is structured.  Bitcoin is limited to say 15 million transactions per month so say 15 million people worldwide could update or load their lightning balances each month.

It used to be good but parts of the difficulty page stopped working correctly when BTC-e died.  For example the bitcoin value has stayed unchanged at $2,546.
It is easy to manually work out the currently expected next difficulty change.  Just take the average block solve time since the last difficulty change and compare to 10 minutes.  Average block solve time is currently 8.82 minutes meaning the next difficulty increase will be around 13% increase (10/8.82).

The fee is paid when the transaction is mined.  Up to that point the transaction may be dropped and returned to your wallet. By default the return of unconfirmed transactions happens after 2 weeks.
As there is no way to cancel a transaction the spammer ultimately can be forced to pay the fee.  All you would need to do is to rebroadcast the transaction after 2 weeks if not already confirmed. It could be an extremely expensive operation for the spammer.

Bitcoin can only do about 350,000 transactions per day.  The miners select transactions based on fee.  So supply/demand keeps fees high.  
Even worse if you miscalculate the fee your transaction may be delayed, or never occur, so there is an extra cost in underestimating fees.
So expect the transaction fees to remain high while bitcoin remains hot.  The best hope is a reduction over the holiday period.

Sounds reasonable.  The Bitcoin system is built to handle 2,100 million million satoshi (21 million bitcoins).  We call 100 million satoshis one Bitcoin but this is just a convenience. 
The total number of satoshi is all that the Bitcoin network cares about when handling values.  2,100 million million is 2.1E15 or just under 2 to the power of 51.  In hex it is ‭775F05A074000‬.  
As already mentioned double precision numbers store with an accuracy of 2 to the power of 52.  So the largest Bitcoin value in satoshi fits with a 2x safety margin.
As mentioned elsewhere in this thread in theory there will be exactly 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshi mined with the last one created around 2140 when block rewards fall to 1 satoshi per block..
A separate question is why did the human nickname "Bitcoin" get applied to 100 million satoshi.  Most currencies only have 2 decimal places to the right of the main unit. Bitcoin is unusually in that a bitcoin has 8 fractional decimal places.
It does not seem to be a technical issue.  We could just as easily be saying there are a million satoshi to a Bitcoin with all current bitcoin values being 100 times larger. Perhaps 21 million bitcoins just seemed to give a good human unit.

There was no opposition at all. In fact there was enormous pressure from people such as Al Gore to speed up the Internet rollout.  For example in the early 1990s there was the National Information Infrastructure to try and get the Internet into every library and school.
In 1993 the Internet already reached 125 countries and had 1.7 million computers. Internet usage was growing at 20% per month. eMail was the killer application with bulletin boards appearing everywhere. 
Then once the WWW and Windows 1995 came out everyone, and I mean everyone, had to have the Internet. 
There was discussion on what should be censured, as there is now.  But no-one opposed the Internet and the WWW itself.  In fact there was enormous pressure to make the Internet available everywhere. In the 8 years between 1992 and 2000 it covered the industrial world.

The fee has been gradually growing since bitcoin was created. It has become worse with the sudden increase in bitcoin value.
There appears to be extreme reluctance to change bitcoin with hard forks to increase throughput so the only solution is to implement layers on top of bitcoin, for example the proposed Lightning channels.  These are planned for some time in the future with no date set for implementation.
At the moment bitcoin is not useful for small value transactions.

There is no fixed cost to mine a bitcoin.  It depends on your electrical cost.

It would be a very major change.  All code would need to be inspected and changed where necessary.  
There is likely to be unexpected effects.  For example a bitcoin value will currently fit in a double floating point number without rounding.  This would no longer be possible.
It is much more likely, and much easier to implement, if ultimately the change would be introduced into second level layers.  For example a lightning type implementation could handle larger divisibility.  Then the value would be rounded down when moved back onto the main chain.

The last block with a block reward (not bitcoin) will be mined around 2140. This is block 6,929,999.  
The last bitcoin occurs earlier.  By slightly after 2100 all except the very last bitcoin will be in existence.  The last 40 years are spent mining smaller and smaller parts of the last bitcoin which is never completely mined.
So you could say that all bitcoins except the last bitcoin are mined by about 2100.  Miners are dependent on the transaction fee.

Your description is correct. It can take a while longer for difficulty to adjust downwards.
This was much debated last year with BCH.  A significant number of miners were switching between BCH and BTC depending on profitability.  This was affecting both coins.  This was largely fixed by BCH adding a fast downward adjustment to the BCH difficulty adjustment.  
Normally there should not be a problem as changes in mining rates over 2 weeks are not that large.  Even a 20% reduction would not be disastrous.

There is no halving of transaction fee each year.  
A transaction fee is nominated by each person creating a transaction.  You set what fee you are prepared to pay and the miners select the most profitable transactions.  In busy times blocks fill up so you have to nominate a decent fee if you want fast throughput.
Perhaps you are confusing with the halving of the bitcoins mined per block.  This occurs every 4 years,

No because modern miners have roughly the same efficiently (0.1 J/Gigahash) at generating bitcoin.  With Bitcoin at say $7,000 you will earn about 12 cents per kWh of electrical energy.  By the time you cover capital and running costs you need power below 6 cents per kWh.
Another way of looking at it is a bitcoin miner is a device for turning electricity into bitcoin.  Each kWh of electricity currently gives about 12 cents worth of bitcoin, out of which you have to cover all your costs.

The task the miners do is simply try to guess a number that when hashed in a certain way (SHA-256) gives a result that falls in a certain range.   On average someone makes a successful guess each 10 minutes.  
A typical miner does many thousands of billions of guesses a second. 
The difficulty increases simply reduce the range for successful guesses, making it even harder.  Currently the odds on a single guess being correct is about 1 in 30,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  (1 in 3*(10 power of 22)).

The extranonce field has always existed and been used.  Even in the early days of PC mining the 32 bit nonce would overflow after about a minute.  Then a field in the header called the extranonce is incremented and the next 4 billion possibilities are checked.   On modern miners the extranonce field is updated thousands of times a second.

Much better to buy a Powerball ticket each month and win really big if you win, than to solo mine on the I7.
Network hashrate is around 43,669,949,157 GH/s.
Let us say I7 can do 43 Megahash/second, or 0.043 GH/s.
Thus network total hashrate is around 1,000,000,000,000 times higher than the I7 hashrate.  So the I7 has 1 chance in around 1,000,000,000,000 of finding the next block.  
Or if you mine 24/7 for a month (4,000 blocks) you have very roughly the same chance of finding one block as you have of buying one ticket and winning Mega Millions or Powerball.

10,000,000 impossible without the entire world collapsing. 
10,000,000 would mean each block mined would be worth $62,500,000 (6.25*10,000,000) and 9 billion dollars worth of bitcoin would be mined each day.   All the world would be covered by miners and miner manufacturers would rule the world.  Electricity would be rationed.
People seem to forget that the amount of electricity used in bitcoin mining will tend to rise in direct proportion to the bitcoin price.  It is currently say 0.3% of world electricity consumption.  A rise to say $20,000 would triple mining revenue and bring electricity usage to about 1%.

The daily estimated hash rate has considerable error.  It is only an estimation based on the random block solve rate.  The estimated daily hash rate has an average daily fluctuation of about 10%.  Estimation hash rate changes of 20% and more are not uncommon.  For example in the two days between 16 and 18 July the hash rate estimate went up by 40%.  In reality the hash rate probably did not change.
Don't read too much into changes over one or two days.

In 20 years (5 halvings, era 8)  this will be down to 0.1% annual increase (inflation) each year which is close to zero.  So yes, bitcoin is currently inflationary but this is only a short term effect.  In the long run bitcoin is deflationary due to what is basically a static supply.

Great analysis but I am puzzled why you say large miners could start turning off miners if bitcoin falls to $6800-7000.  Presumably these large miners are paying under 5 cents per kWh.
At current difficulty, and say large miner price for electricity of 5 cents per kWh, I get a power breakeven point of about $2,000 per bitcoin.  This is the point where it is not even worth powering up the miner.
This is at current difficulty.  Miners paying above say 5 cents per kWh would have stopped mining by then so difficulty would be lower.  Turn off point at 5 cents per kWh ccould, by then, be well below $2,000.

All that matters is the fee and physical transaction size on the blockchain giving fee per byte (satoshi/byte).
The actual amount of bitcoin being transferred makes no difference.

The block UTC timestamps do not matter much and have no effect on when the difficulty adjustment occurs.  As long as the block timestamps are within 2 hours of previous block times the block is accepted.  There are slight differences between miner computer times which means you can sometimes see the time of later blocks as being earlier than previous blocks.
In summary the difficulty is adjusted after exactly 2016 blocks.  The time taken to solve the 2016 blocks does not matter.

The priority of a transaction depends on both your transaction physical size on the blockchain, and the fee.  You are basically bidding to buy space on the blockchain,

Why do you think miners deliberately mine empty blocks?  The only site I still see with smaller blocks is the occasional "unknown" site generating 749k blocks, presumably because they are still running with the old mining parameters.
Empty blocks usually only occur in the first few seconds after the previous block is found.   Miners are still sorting out a new full block and just mine a small block while preparing data.
Partly empty blocks, other than the 749k blocks, can also occur intermittently but I see no sign of deliberate actions to not fill blocks.  Why would miners not want to collect as much fee revenue as possible?
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:38:17
You could have a hard fork that restarts creating bitcoins each time a block is mined.
The 21 million bitcoin limit is just a convention based on current bitcoins per block.  
There is nothing to stop a future hardfork generating say 4 bitcoins per block forever.

The cap is because the bitcoin ledger grows at a limit of 1 megabyte per 10 minutes.   The size of this cap is controlled by the miners.
Growing the transaction rate depends on either the miners agreeing to bigger blocks, or for ways to be developed to move some transactions off the main blockchain, for example lightning.
To the miners the current situation is not necessarily a problem. They could lift the cap in 2 weeks if they wished.
They see the bitcoin transaction fee as providing an efficient automatic economic adjustment between supply and demand.  As the fee rises the supply/demand curve shifts so demand matches supply.
They also see the current situation as maximizing their profit and like all of us they are in bitcoin to make money.
Incidentally the 7 transactions per second cap is wrong.  It assumes everyone does simple one input, 2 output transactions about 240 bytes in size giving 7 transaction per second.  In fact the average transaction is about 500 bytes meaning that in reality the transaction cap is about 3.5 transactions per second.

Gap was 95 minutes between blocks 453,670 and 453,671.
This is rare, a gap like this will only occur ever 3 months or so on average.  Probability of it occurring in an average day (144 blocks) is 1.08%.
Mathematically the probability of a gap exceeding x minutes is exp(-minutes/10) as blocks are solved with a poisson distribution averaging 10 minutes.  An hour delay occurs 2 or 3 times a week.

It may do as you say but no-one is going to make major changes to a multi billion dollar system without very good reason.  
And any change has to approved by the miners who are rightly very reluctant to do anything to change the existing system.  Even a simple increase in the block size is a major issue.  
Ultimately the scalability solution is likely to be newer technologies running above the blockchain, for example lightning.

Also interesting discussion at following site, especially on needing to fit satoshi in a 64 bit double floating point number.
Languages such as Perl and Javascript stored all internal numbers as 64 bit floating point numbers (doubles), so possibly this set a reasonable limit on the number of satoshi.  Doubles are also frequently used in coding and in APIs, despite not being ideal for currencies. Limit on floating point is 9E15, maximum satoshi is 2.1E15.

With a reasonable fee a transaction usually takes under 20 minutes but can take up to a couple of hours as block creation time is random.  With minimal fee a transaction can take days or even revert back after 3 days (72 hours).  See 
A dust transaction is taken as 546 satoshi or about 0.5 cents. So take the minimum transaction value as 0.5 cents.  
Note - This is based on the minimum fee for transaction relay by nodes of 0.00001/kByte.

True in an ideal world but floating point is sometimes used, especially in APIs.  For example Bitcoin's JSON-RPC interface.  There were also some early bitcoin calls with floats.  
Floats can precisely represent a bitcoin amount.  The problem occurs, as you say, if you try to do arithmetic using values that cannot be precisely represented, for example 0.1.  The same problem occurs if you store the bitcoin value in an 64 bit integer. 
Decimal types move the errors to a more human factor of decimal rather than binary, but it is still normally just not possible to store numbers like 1/3 with precision.  For example value/3 will give rounding errors.  The only solution normally is to carry lots of digits of precision (&gt;64 bits) and then round back to say 2 fractional digits at the end.

Waiting 2016 blocks is around the level required to calculate the true network hash rate to within a couple of percent.
The blocks are found with a poisson distribution averaging 10 minutes.   The actual gap between the blocks can range from seconds to an hour or so.  So just by looking at block solve times you never really know the true exact network hash rate.
The error in calculating the true network hash rate varies as the square root of the number of blocks solved.  So after 2016 blocks the error is about sqrt(2016)/100 or 2%.  If you changed the difficulty every day the difficulty error would be around sqrt(144)/100 or 8%.
@_date: 2016-03-30 02:26:14
This is a good example of the dangers of extrapolating into the future.
The author assumed there will be a continuous 12% growth rate in network hashing each month.  In other words the network hash rate will double roughly each 6 months.  
In reality there is no 'automatic' network hashrate increase every month.  
Any network hash rate changes are based on improvements in mining hardware efficiency and on the price of bitcoin.  In other words miners will only mine if it is profitable.  
If you are silly enough to assume an automatic hash rate increase of 12% each month you will naturally get a very large figure for electrical consumption in a few years.  And a good clickbait headline.

There is no good average amount of unconfirmed transactions.  Unconfirmed transactions tend to be higher during the day in the US and fall overnight.  
You can think of this way, currently each day 300,000 transactions can be processed.  These will be the transactions with the appropriate fee in satoshi/byte.  Ultimately the fee will stabilize around a point where only that number of transactions are generated.  Supply will equal demand.  
On your second question - you are bidding for physical space on the blockchain.  It is a pure market.  The higher fee in satochi/byte wins.

It is going on all around the world and is hard to stop.  
In the past collecting the ransom was the most difficult part of a ransom attempt.  With Bitcoin collecting the ransom is now trivial. It just takes one person to open an infected email attachment.  
The solution may include things like user education, restricting the file shares that users have write access to, and IT to ensure eMail systems automatically isolating any eMail with Javascript (.js files) or incoming Office document containing a macro.  People may also need to stop depending solely on online storage or cloud storage, for example onedrive, for backup. Offline storage is safer.

"Bitcoin Core 0.12 will have a strict maximum size on the mempool. The default value is 300 MB and can be configured with the -maxmempool parameter. Whenever a transaction would cause the mempool to exceed its maximum size, the transaction that (along with in-mempool descendants) has the lowest total feerate (as a package) will be evicted and the node’s effective minimum relay feerate will be increased to match this feerate plus the initial minimum relay feerate. The initial minimum relay feerate is set to 1000 satoshis per kB."

Your transaction is confirmed in block 451,305.  
There was a gap if 1 hour 9 minutes between it and the previous block.  You just had to wait.  Your high fee meant you went in the first available block.

Technically it would require a hard fork which means for more than 50% of miners to agree. It would require little coding change.  One simple way would be to change the block reward so it was x bitcoins per block forever.

The problem is unlikely to be open network ports. It is an eMail and user education issue. The ransomware (Locky) comes in as macros in Office documents.  
When the macro runs selected users files (doc,docx,odt, dat and so on) are encrypted, including any accessible files on network shares or in the cloud.  
Possibly, any external eMail which contains files with macros, needs to be isolated by the eMail system.

Current network hash rate is about 930,000 Terrahash or 930,000,000 gigahash.  You have 20 gigahash.  Each day about 3600 (25*144) Bitcoins are mined.  
So you would earn 3600 * 20 / 930,000,000 or 0.000 077 Bitcoins.  Total value under 3 cents a day.

There is always inconsistent block spacing.  That is the way bitcoin works - blocks occur with a poisson distribution averaging 10 minutes.  An hour gap between blocks occurs multiple times a week.
200 sat/byte will go through very quickly 0-5 blocks at  for 181-200 satoshi/byte.

Why do you think there are lots of pending transactions?
Every mempool can see it differently depending on how it handles transactions.  For example the following shows that after recent blocks there is nothing left to mine.
It also depends if the mempool drops transactions after 72 hours.  It is possible  still shows 17,000 unconfirmed 1-20 satoshi/byte transactions because they are not being deleted after 72 hours.

The problem with mining is that it is energy intensive.  Basically you get about 10 Gigahash/s per Watt.  Finding a block currently requires about 55,000 kWh of electrical energy.
The result is mining will always move to the areas with cheap electricity.
Solving impasses depends on compromise.   At the moment compromise seems to be lacking.  The sides should at least agree that a hard fork to increase block size will be needed and that a layer 2 solution like Lightning is needed.
Ultimately there will be a solution.  Also don't forget what happened to many first/early movers who once dominated.  They were replaced by a better solution (MySpace, Alta Vista, Yahoo, Lotus, Wordperfect, Lycos .... )

From that you need to pay for the initial unit and electricity.

The 21 computer was basically a demonstration unit.  Some would say it was a toy for programmers built around a 25$ Rasberry Pi.  It was never intended for serious mining.  You will be struggling to even fit the current blockchain on the 128 GB SD card.

Minor point.  Segwit does not increase the blocksize.  It just moves some items out of the block allowing more transactions per block.
The block size stays 1 MB which is why it is not a major change and can be done as a softfork.  Both old and new software treats the block as a valid 1 MB block.
Ultimately the block size needs to be increased even if Lightning is implemented.  This will require a hardfork.

Most/many S9s will never find a block. That is why people mine thru pools.
The chance of an S9 finding a block in the next 6 months with current difficulty is under 10%.  An S9 represents about 1 in 250,000 of the current hash rate.  Over the next 6 months about 25,000 blocks will be found thus about 10% chance.   But the difficulty will keep rising so the chance is going down.
Another way of looking at it is, you would need multiple S9s to be able to use that 50,000 kWh and find your block.

There is also a need to make certain the various LN implementations are compatible.  Otherwise LN may turn into a nightmare of different implementations.  See 
Setwit was to fix the transaction malleability issue as well as some other issues but now seems unlikely to reach the required 95% of blocks activation level.

The problem this time is that there is no consensus on which of two directions Bitcoin should move.  Hard forks are only safe if you have consensus across most of the miners.

Ok, you come up with an algorithm which runs on a CPU and cannot be speeded up by hardware assistance.
The result is central mining farms with millions of CPUs.  
Mining will always be done in large scale.  It is just cheaper for big operators to build hardware in bulk and run in the cheapest location.  
Satoshi always expected there would be 'big server farms' rather than lots of small miners.
From Satoshi - July 29 2010. "The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."
Remember Bitcoin was designed as a way of doing financial transactions without needing trusted third parties. That is what was meant by decentralization. Bitcoin is not about decentralized mining (or nodes). It is about the ability to do financial transactions without a mutually trusted party.

You are confusing energy (joules) with power (watts).
The 720,485,000,000 is joules, not watts.  This is total energy, not power.  Joules are like the total energy stored in a fuel tank.  Watts are how much energy is consumed per second.
You need to divide the total joules used in 4 hours by 4*3600 or 14,400 to convert to watts.  This gives 720,485,280,000/14,400 or 50 megawatts.

It you have about $1K of free power you need to work out how much power you have available in Watts.

It would be a mammoth change with considerable risk of software issues. 
Just one example - the largest possible bitcoin value at present is 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshi which just fits in a double floating point number without rounding (52 bits).   Introducing larger values could make current software with floating point calculations prone to rounding errors.

The current bitcoin network hash rate is estimated from the current difficulty and the length of time between solving blocks.  This gives the  formula
Hash Rate = Difficulty * 2**32 / SecondsBetweenBlocks
At any time we can estimate the hash rate by looking at the time between blocks.  Note that this time is in error by the square root of the number of blocks counted as blocks are found with a poisson distribution.  Over 1 day the estimate can be out by 8%, over 2016 blocks by about 2%:
For example at the end of the last difficulty adjustment we get the approximate hash rate in gigahash from the difficulty as follows.
3,298,315,540 = 460,769,358,091 * 2**32 / 600

Compared to a month ago the BTC/USD value has fallen about 20% and mining difficulty has increased by about 10%.  So mining income has fallen by about 25-30%.  
How this affects a miners profitability depends on the miners cost, particularly initial capital cost and electricity cost.

Agreed.  Transaction size limit used to be 100,000 bytes but with the recent move from 'bytes' to 'weight' it is hard to tell exactly what the limit is for transactions.  The old value was MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIZE = 100,000.
Now it is MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT = 400000;
Possibly it now still works out as 100,000 bytes for current transactions and a 400,000 weight for future Segwit transactions.
Either way I would be wary of creating transaction over 100,000 bytes.

It is up to the miners.  The miners are the only ones who decide what goes on the blockchain. 
Some nodes can go off in a huff and not relay some blocks but that is all they can do.  Blocks will keep coming from the miners every 10 minutes.  The longest chain, with the majority of hashing, wins.

Another error in the article is that it says the halving from 50 to 25 coins occurred in 2011. It occurred in November 2012.
Also money supply normally means the sum of currency in circulation.  Saying "There will be more demand with half the supply. " is perhaps not correct when talking about financial assets.  It is the rate of increase in the number of Bitcoins that halves, not the money supply.  The rate of increase will fall from 12.5% to 6% per year.
Finally the article says "Currently there are about 3650 bitcoin produced every day. That will be reduced to 1825 literally overnight. Considering there are about 250,000 transacted each day and about 5MM to 15MM USD worth traded. That leaves little room for sluggish production." This implies that Bitcoins are somehow being consumed and we have to mine new Bitcoins to continue with Bitcoin.

Segwit probably will not make a huge difference initially as Segwit increases real world block size to say 1.6 to 2 MB.  The exact improvement depends of the pattern of single vs multisignature transactions.
Note - The theoretical block maximum of 4MB is for a single transaction consisting of nothing but segwit data.  This would not occur in the real world.
The big improvement will come once Lightning systems are available and channels are all interconnected.

The unusual transaction(s) seem to have been ignored by the miners.  There have been lots of half filled blocks since the mempool value, and fee value jumped.  
It is most likely there is a chain of unconfirmed transactions.  The 'change' output from one transaction becomes the input to the next.  It looks like a lot of Btc has moved but in reality only a small amount has been spent.

Bitcoin is currently approaching capacity problems.
There are two ways to increase capacity.
1) Increase the block size.  This involves a hard fork which requires at least 50%, and preferable 80%, of miners to agree.
2) Alternatively some current Bitcoin problems can be fixed with a simple update giving a roughly double of capacity (Segwit) and then a new system be built on top of Bitcoin (Lightning).  Lightning runs largely independent of the current miners.  Segwit as currently coded requires at least 95% of miners to agree.  Ultimately a block size increase (hard fork) may still be required if Bitcoin becomes wildly popular.
There are arguments for both approaches which is why not everyone agrees.  There are also some mid way approaches so it is not necessarily either one approach or the other.

The BU hard form becomes possibe when BU has over 50% of the hash power, but not really likely until they have 75%.  Thus a BU hard fork is currently unlikely.
Segwit is a soft fork and as currently configured requires 95% of hashing power (technically 95% of blocks over a 2016 block period).  It is thus also very unlikely.
The most likely outcome at present is that nothing happens.

Unlikely to be profitable.  Even running miners 24/7 it is difficult to get a return. 
PowerWall II is about 13.5 kWh.  This would only run an Antminer 9 for about 9 hours.   So you would need to get a smaller less efficient miner.   Bitcoin miners need a stack of power.  A single Antminer S9 uses as much power as 1.5 houses.

A technical reason for 2016 blocks is that the actual network hash rate can only be estimated by taking the average time between blocks.
The error in calculating the total network hash rate varies as the square root of the number of blocks taken as the sample.  So taking it over 2016 blocks gives about a 2% error in estimating the network hash rate.  Doing it over a day (144 blocks) gives about an 8% error.
There other possibilities, for example a sliding adjustment, but 2016 blocks is simple and reasonably accurate.

$800 worth of electricity per coin is rubbish unless you are paying at least 20 cents per kWh for electricity.  What was the source of the $800?
Assuming a S9 type miner (0.1 Joule/Gigahash) /Each block takes about 55,000 kWh of electricity.  Each coin about 55,000/12.5 or say 4,400 kWh.
So at 10 cents per kWh each coin costs about $440 for electricity.
At 5 cents per kWh $220 for electricity per coin.
The cheapest miners are probably at about 2 cents per kWh so the cost would be as little as $88 per bitcoin for electricity.
Of course there are additional cost, for example the miner cost.  Also the cost rises as the difficulty rises. But for those with really cheap electricity mining is currently very profitable.

You need electricity under about 6 cents a kWh to break even.
21.co only released a toy for programmers and nothing since.
Basically mining is about turning electricity into Bitcoins.  In summary, using the efficiency of an Antminer S9, it takes about 50,000 kWh of electrical energy to mine one block of 12.5 bitcoins.

A graphics card consists of say a thousand very simple but fast processors.  This makes them very suitable for doing simple tasks that can be split between multiple processors, for example graphics and bitcoin mining.
A CPU has a handful of much more powerful processors which include additional functions like floating point numbers and virtual memory.  As well the CPU processors work on tasks that normally are not done in parallel.

Mining is like a lottery, or the traditional US numbers game or racket.
Every 10 minutes (on average) a prize is given (currently 25 Bitcoins).  It goes to the first person to get a number in the lucky number range.  Bitcoin mining is the process of calculating new numbers until someone hits the lucky number.  
It requires a small amount of electricity to get a random number to compare with the lucky number.  Special machines called ASIC miners have been developed to calculate and try billions of numbers a second.  At present 1,563,871,317,000,000,000 numbers are compared across the Bitcoin network to the lucky number range each second.  So quite a lot of electricity is being used.
A fall in the value of Bitcoin reduces the value of the prize.  Some people may no longer bother playing but most people will continue to 'try' for the lucky number as long as their electricity price is below the potential returns.
If it is taking longer than average to find the lucky number, taken over 2016 prizes, it is made slightly easier to find a lucky number by making the lucky number range wider.  This is called a difficulty adjustment.  If the lucky number is coming up too often the lucky range is reduced.  The difficulty is increased. So over a period the interval between prizes stays at 10 minutes.
Some groups of people have set up large installations with thousands of machines capable of trying enormous amounts of numbers.  These are normally located in areas with cheap electricity, generally near hydro plants with surplus electricity.  These are called mining farms.
Pools are a way were many people can share in trying numbers and in the resulting prizes.   There are only about 144 prizes a day so the chance of one individual getting the prize is low.
The prize falls from 25 to 12.5 Bitcoins in 2 weeks. This is the halving. People are worried about the impact of the halving of the prize.  Some people will stop trying to guess the number (mining).  Possibly 20-30% of mining may eventually stop.  There may be a small increase in the average time between prizes to about 12-15 minutes for about 11 days until the interval readjusts.   
As one megabyte of Bitcoin transactions are processed in conjunction with the prize this means there may be a small extra delay in transactions being processed for a few days.  This will mean a slight reducing in total throughput for these 10 or so days.  The halving occurs a third of the way between difficulty adjustments.  
For many miners a bigger problem than the halving, is likely to be the speed with which they can move to the new generation of 16/14 nm miners.  The new generation of miners are at least twice as energy efficient when compared to the older 28 nm miners.

Q1.  Most big miners do not try to be anonymous.  They need to raise funds.  For known large farms see 
Q2. Two reasons mining is not profitable for most people, electricity cost and the only miners available are either obsolete or very high cost.
The average person does not have cheap electricity. Large farms are normally located near hydroelectricity dams with surplus electricity.
Also the latest mining equipment is not available to the general public.  Manufactures such as KNC and Bitfury stopped selling to the public.  The manufactures use the miners themselves and if they eventually sell to the public it is at a high cost making any return difficult.  For example it is believed 16/14nm miners have been used by large miners for over 6 months.  Yet the first 16/14nm miner (Antminer S9) has only just gone on sale to the public at a cost of $2100. 
In fact BitmainTech/Antminer is now the only manufacturer that bothers selling modern miners (S7,S9) to the general public.
Q3.  With Bitcoin worth $600 and 0.10 KWh electricity you would need to have an efficiency better than 0.645 Joule/Gigahash. So the Antminer S5 and the KNC Neptune are now worth turning back on. If Bitcoin goes to $700 the Antminer s4 and the SP20 will also be worth turning back on. 
At least for the next 4 weeks.

Fee was possibly under 0.00001 BTC (mintxfee).  Anything under that is regarded as spam and is not relayed by all nodes.

Some comments.
Before you do anything make certain you understand how the blockchain works internally.   For example understand in detail how you could determine the btc balance of an address.
The Blockchain is the only central source of information.  It is the core resource. It can be hard to analysis because of its size and dependency on linked transactions. You will need to build summary tables.
Unconfirmed transactions are not centrally stored.   It is up to each node to determine what will be relayed and thus treated as an unconfirmed transaction.  Currently most nodes will not relay transactions with a fee under 0.00001 BTC as it is regarded as spam. If a transaction is over 72 hours it is also likely to be dropped.  
In other words there is no central list of unconfirmed transaction.  
You are correct in saying, that to get current unconfirmed transactions you will need to run your own node and look at what is in your mempool.  
There are already a number of tools doing such things as calculating probability of transactions being confirmed.  For example  uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the fee required to be 90% certain of a transaction being confirmed within x blocks.

There is no "specific price limit for lot of miners to remain profitable".  
As it becomes less profitable miners drop out and difficulty falls. So remaining miners are profitable.
Bitcoin had miners when Bitcoin was $1. Altcoins have miners  even though they are not worth much.
There is no specific price point for miners.  Those who can make a profit remain, those who cannot drop out.
Either way a block gets found every 10 minutes on average.

As a general comment mempool charts on the internet give totally different values for the unconfirmed transactions in mempool.
For example  shows about 22,000 unconfirmed transaction while Bitcoinqueue.com shows about 40,000 and  about 50,000.
Different transaction timeouts are presumably part of the reason.
But the tradeblock.com figure seems particularly strange as it gives an average transaction size of over 1,000 bytes based on number of transaction and mempool size they display.  Currently they display 22,000 transaction and 27 Mbytes in mempool.

If 50% of all worldwide miners were instantly removed the block interval would rise to 20 minutes.  After a period where Bitcoin was slow, say 2-3 weeks difficulty would reset.  The difficulty resets every 2016 blocks.  Everything is then back where it was.

In a heat engine the theoretical maximum efficiency of a thermal engine is temperature difference / hot temperature in Kelvin. 
So with 100C heat sink hot temperature and say 25C constant cold temperature the theoretical maximum efficiency is 75/(100+273) = 20%.
You are not likely to save much on electricity.  Maybe a few percent if lucky in exchange for considerable complexity.
Look up Carnot efficiency if you want more information.

Assuming 135 Megabytes per day on blockchain and 100 Bitcoins per day in fees the average fee works out as about 74 satoshi/byte.
Taking 226 bytes as the median byte size and making the major assumption the median transaction pays that fee, you get 226*74 or 16700  satoshi. This is about 15 cents at 1 btc = $890.
So median fee is somewhere around 15 cents.
Average fee is 100 Bitcoins in fees / 260,000 transaction per day or about  38,000 satoshi.
So average fee is around 33 cents.
The median value of about 15 cents per transaction is the important value.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:43:08
It depends on your transactions physical size.   The fee is so much per byte of transaction size.  If you give the transaction Id or the transaction physical size we can give a better estimate.  See

Difficulty will always stabilize around the point where mining is no longer profitable for those at the marginal electrical price.  The following gives an example showing that difficulty could rise to 3 times the current value.  Feel free to play with the assumptions.
Mining revenue is currently 6 * 12.5 * 900 or 67,500 dollars per hour
Assuming half of this goes to electricity we get 33,750 dollars per hour for electricity. 
Assuming a marginal electricity cost of 0.03 kWh this is enough for 1,100,000 kWh.
At current S9 efficiency of 0.1 J/gigahash or 10 Terrahash per kW this gives 11,000,000 Terrahash or about three times the current network hashrate.
Difficulty is then hashrate / 7158388.055 or about 1,500,000,000,000.
In equation form 
expectedHashRate = miners_revenue_per_hour * fraction_used_for_electricity * hashrate_per_kW / marginal_cost_kWh
Difficulty = hashrate / 7158388.055

Network hash rate is about 1,512,291,611,000 MHash/s (bitcoinwisdom.com)

Not as bitcoin is currently structured. It currently does not have the throughput.
Bitcoin is currently limited to say 300 million transactions a year.  If people did just 2 load/unloads each year because they used sidechains/lightning it would still support less than say 150 million people.  If people did one Bitcoin transaction/transfer a month it would support say 30 million people max.
It would need a 100 fold improvement in throughput, even with lightning, to start handling the world.

I assume you mean 0.05 dollars (5 cents).  This is say 22 satoshi/byte.  This is a low fee.
This is going to take a long while to confirm.  It it takes over 72 hours the transaction will be dropped.  I personally expect it will be confirmed over the weekend.
So the move from 30 minutes to 86 hours is just indicating the length of time it really will possibly take. 30 minutes is just the average time for 3 confirmations if you pay a high enough fee to go into the next block.

People doing large numbers of Bitcoin transactions group them together to lower fees.  So a transaction may have a hundred or so inputs or outputs and be 50-100,000 bytes in size.  Transactions larger than 100 kilobytes are non-standard.

Bitcoin mining draws say 600 megawatts of power, mainly in areas with surplus hydro power.  This is insignificant in the worlds total electricity generation.  It is about 5 TWh per year in total world production of about 23,000 TWh. 
Total electricity value is under about 260 million dollars per year.
The calculations.  Total network is about 3,115,359,144 GH/s.  At average efficient of say 0.2 J/Gigahash this is about 3,115,359,144/5 or 600 megawatts.
At 5 cents per kWh this is about 600,000 * 24 * 365 * 0.05 or around 260 million dollars a year.
Or looking at it another way, assuming half of all mining costs are electricity we again get a similar figure from say $400 per bitcoin or 144 * 365 * 12.4 * 400 giving around 260 million dollars a year.
These are worse case figures. The average cost of electricity to miners is probably under 5 cents per kWh making the electricity cost lower and if everyone used Antminer S9s electricity use and cost would halve again.

The comment "honest nodes will always control the majority of the computing power" should be "honest miners/pools will always control the majority of the computing power".  It is the miners/pools who control the system.
The most likely approach to controlling the network would be if pools with over 51% of the hashing network colluded.  Currently this would be the 4 largest pools.  Unlikely but possible.  
Maybe the Chinese government could take over the Chinese pools and have more that 51% of the hashing power.  Also unlikely but possible.
Another possibility is that over 51% of the network possibly runs on miners from one manufacturer - BitmanTech/Antminers.  I have no doubt they are honest, but there may be a way a miner manufacturer with the majority of the network could influence mining.
In summary 51% attacks are possible but unlikely because there is little benefit to the attacker.

There is no single electrical price per country.  
Mining is in places with really cheap electricity, which basically means next to new large hydro systems with surplus power. Hydro dams are usually built to full capacity even if the demand is not there yet.  China has lots of cheap hydro in the western areas.  Hydro generates about 20% of China's power. 
The price just depends where you are in the country and what you can negotiate.  Bitcoin farms use many megawatts.

Count your power circuit breakers to give current max S9s.

Empty blocks are generated as a normal part of mining.
After a block is found by the network it takes a few seconds for miners to abandon mining, process mempool and build a new block. During this time miners try to find a block with no transactions. Most empty blocks occur within a few seconds of the previous block.
Assuming it takes about 5 to 10 seconds to prepare for the next block you should see 1 to 2% empty blocks.

A few days ago someone put through a btc transaction with a 50 btc fee.  That is about a $45,000 fee.    
Transactions like that will have a big effect on the average but almost no effect on the median.  Even on normal days there are fees of $10 or more as people put through transactions with hundred of inputs or outputs.
The median is the value that must be used when there are a small number of large outlying values.
The median is the better indicator of common values when you have skewed values.  That is why statistics talk about the median house price, not the average house price.

Your transaction is said to be confirmed when it is stored in the blockchain.  This is the bitcoin 'ledger'.
Every 10 minutes on average a new 1 megabyte 'block' is added to the blockchain.  But this time is random and there can be variations of up to an hour or so between blocks.  This is the first source of variation.
Because blockchain space is valuable you bid for space.  This is the transaction fee.  If you don't have a high enough fee you will not get your transaction in the next block.  In fact at busy times you may have to wait hours or days until the network load drops.  This is the second source of variation.
You are buying space in the blockchain.  To work out your priority divide your fee by the physical transaction length. Unfortunately the blockchain explorers generally do not display this value.  Then use sites such as the following to get expected transaction speed based on your transaction fee / physical size.

It is up to the miner to work out what goes in each block.  Rationally they will select the most profitable transactions but there is nothing to stop them selecting whichever transaction they wish in whatever order, or even no transactions at all.  So only the miner knows why they selected the transactions in their blocks.
For example ViaBTC can include some low fee transactions in each block (ViaBTC Accelerator).
All the miner needs to do is ensure the block generated is accepted by other nodes and miners as technically valid.

I feel bitcoin is currently operating as a store of value (like gold), not as an active currency.  Low transaction rates on a Saturday night may not matter because that is not where bitcoin has value.
Does bitcoin offer an advantage for the average person for simple retail transaction?  Is it easier or faster to use than competing payment methods?  No it is not.
Retail payments are all about ease of use.  Even on the Internet it is generally easier, and safer, to use Paypal.

As others will say bitcoin mining is basically about turning electricity into bitcoin.

Mining is normally done in western China using hydro power.
When a new dam and hydro plant is built all the generation plant is installed at the time of dam construction as it is difficult/impossible to do it later.

Of course some fonts may have jumped the gun and have the symbol already because the proposed value has been known for a while.  Except to see it first in open source Unix based systems.  Apple and Microsoft will be later as their product cycle is slower.

Miners can do whatever they like.  But deliberately mining an empty block is unlikely.  There is a financial cost as an empty block lacks the transaction fees. This can represent thousands of dollars.  
You are most likely to find an empty block mined within a few seconds of the previous block. After a block is found, it takes a few seconds for miners to readjust their mempool.  During this time miners try mining an empty block.

Gold is likely to remain less volatile than bitcoin.  Gold has some use outside being a store of wealth.  This keeps a floor under the price of gold as the industrial use of gold rises if the price falls.
Electronics uses quite a bit of gold, especially to make connectors that don't tarnish.  Every smartphone has at least 50 cents worth of gold.  Laptop have several dollars worth of gold.  Gold is also used in other areas, for example dentistry.  As gold gets cheaper these areas use more gold providing an automatic floor on the gold price.  
As well gold production (mining) adjusts as the price changes.  If the price rises there is an increase in production, if the gold price falls the production falls.  There is a lead time on this but over several years production does tend to follow price providing stability in price.

Then restart mining again. The resulting difficulty drop could by 6 lots of 20%.  Then expect a return to blocks every few minutes on the BCH chain and a slower BTC chain.

You are talking a lot of money.
Bitcoin Cash currently has a difficulty about a quarter of the BTC chain and is finding blocks about a fifth as fast as the main chain.  So it currently has a twentieth the hash rate of the BTC network, or 5%.
The current BTC hash rate is about 6,224,502 TH/s so you need 5% of this..  So you would need 311,000 TH/s or about 26,000 S9s.  You are still only likely to find one Bitcoin Cash block per hour.   
Renting at least 26,000 S9s for a few days or months may also be a little expensive and difficult.  And this assumes the Bitcoin Cash people don't respond.

When a block is mined the miner receives a reward via a transaction that has no parent.   These newly generated coins could in theory be spent immediately.
Generated coins however cease to exist when the block is orphaned. If the network allowed miners to spend them immediately it would be the recipient of the coins not the miner who would suffer a loss from the miner's block being orphaned.
So to avoid that undesirable situation the network requires rewards to miners to "mature" or wait 100 confirmations.  If a block is orphaned before it gets 100 blocks deep into the chain, then only the miner is affected.

General accepted as between about $1,000 and $3,000 for large scale farms in cheap locations (under 3 cents per kWh).  Up to $3-4,000 in areas with more expensive electricity.
Obviously this point rises and falls as network difficulty changes.  If miners drop out the cost to mine a bitcoin falls.
"Marginal cost" of mining is just the point where mining a bitcoin is uneconomical.  "Marginal Cost" of mining will always tend to equal the value of a bitcoin by definition..

Tradition has it that one reason was the need to keep the number of satoshi within the limits of 64 bit double floating numbers with a small margin for multiplication/division rounding. 
64 bit floating gives 52 bits of explicit storage.  Interestingly 2 to the power of 51 is 2,251,799,813,685,248 units.  This is just enough to store 21 million coins times 10^8 divisions.
Some languages, for example javascript, do all arithmetic as double floating point numbers, as satoshi would have known.

It would probably go through over the weekend.  The network has a lower load over the weekend.   If the transaction was 250 bytes long the fee, as seen by the miners, would be 4 satoshi/byte. 
Note that the fee depends on the transaction size.   It is best expressed as satoshi/byte.  
 0.00001 BTC per kilobyte is the  minimum relay fee.

You cannot divide a bitcoin further than a satoshi as internally the bitcoin protocol operates in discrete units of a 100 millionth of a Bitcoin.  A satoshi is just the common name for this smallest unit.
Common Bitcoin units are:
mBTC - a milli-Bitcoin, or a thousandth of a Bitcoin, or 0.001 BTC.
uBTC - a micro-Bitcoin, or a millionth of a Bitcoin, or 100 satoshi.  Also sometimes called a 'bit'.  With uBTC, or bits, there are then 2 decimal places making it similar to most decimal currencies. 
5.2 BTC would be 5,200 mBTC or 5,200,000 uBTC.
There is no common name for multiples of a satoshi.  For example a million satoshi is not called a mega-satoshi.

Only with a major change to the protocol.  It would also involve extensive software testing.
The current limit of satoshi fits into an IEEE 64 bit floating point number without rounding problems.  Any increase is going to mean any software using floating point numbers, either directly or indirectly, to store satoshi would need to be recoded.  
The current 2.1E15 number of satoshi requires 51 bits.
Presumably the simplest increase would be to 63 bits as most code already store satoshi as 64 bit integers.

In detail the standard error of a poisson distribution is 1 / square root of number of counts.
So 1 / square root (2016) or .02 or 2%.
If we took blocks over 1 day we get 1/sqrt(144) = .08 or 8% error.
Over 4 blocks it is 1/sqrt(4) = 0.5 or 50% error.
One result is that even if the hash rate was totally stable there will be a small random adjustment each 2016 blocks due to the random distribution of blocks.

It was always expected mining was likely to end up being done by a few large players. Bitcoin was created as a way of transferring value without needing to go via a centralized organization.  Bitcoin mining is just part of the infrastructure for this to occur.  The mining process itself does not need to be heavily decentralized.

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

BCH blocks will remain very rare. 
While there will soon be slow adjustments of the BCH difficulty these adjustments will stop once blocks come much faster than every hour.  
In summary once the difference in MTP between 6 blocks becomes less than 12 hours the faster difficulty adjustment will stop.
BCH will then just have normal difficulty changes after 2016 blocks.  This means BCH blocks will remain very infrequent for a very long time.

A typical modern Bitcoin miner draws about 1,000 Watts.  Say 1,500 watts for an S9, 900 watts for an R4. 
Miners like to S9 generate as much heat as a large space heater and are as noisy as a hair dryer on full power or vacuum cleaner. 
An ATM may draw 10 watts while idle.   Say 1% of a typical miner.

There is no magically $6,000 cost to mine a bitcoin.  
It will always cost the the least profitable roughly the value of one bitcoin to mine one bitcoin.  Miners who cannot mine at a profit drop out.  Those who make a profit add more miners so difficulty rises. 
If bitcoin fell to $1,000 all miners who could not make a profit at $1,000 would stop mining, thus increasing the profit of remaining miners.  The cost of mining one bitcoin for the least efficient would then stabilize at $1,000.
The cost to mine a bitcoin follows the value of bitcoin, not the other way around.

The number of transactions Bitcoin can handle per second depends on the average transaction size.  
The average transaction size is currently about 500 bytes, the median size is about 226 bytes.  Some transactions have hundreds of inputs or outputs.  It is more efficient (and cheaper) to group many small transactions into one transaction rather than send many small transactions.   Transaction sizes above 10,000 bytes are not unusual.
So the average block has about 1,000,000/500 or 2,000 transactions.
This means a current maximum of about 2,000/600 or 3.3 transactions per second.

Interesting article but has some flaws.  For example it says "On an annualised basis this consumption corresponds to approximately 35 TWh, less than the annual energy consumption of Luxembourg."
I can find no where on the web saying that Luxembourg has an annual electricity consumption above 35 TWh.  The quoted Luxembourg electricity figures are under 10 TWhs.  The usage reference in the article gives 8.2 TWh.  So it would take half a dozen Luxembourg to equal bitcoin. 
Also the article compares bitcoin electrical use to total generating "installed capacity" of the world to get the 0.14%.  It should be compared to the actual energy production giving 0.18% based on their figures.

Block time will increase from the current 8.9 minutes to 10 minutes on average.
Point at which it is not worth powering up a modern miner falls from about 17 to about 15 cents per kWh. Some miners will be sold and moved to areas with cheaper electricity.
That's about all the change you will see.  Still it shows an impressive increase in the hash rate.
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:18:08
Fees are based on the number of bytes used in the blockchain because this is the limiting resource with Bitcoin.  It takes the same Bitcoin resources to send a .001 BTC transaction as a 100 BTC transaction if the transaction physical size is the same.  This may change in the future with Lightning but for the moment transaction physical size is a critical factor.
Transactions with very low fees will generally go through overnight (US time) as the load on the network tends to fall overnight.  There is a 72 hour (3 day) dropout time for transactions from the mempool but as far as I know there has never been a time when valid transactions have been delayed that long. 
Also transaction with a fee less than 0.00001 BTC/kiloByte (1,000 Satoshi/kB) are likely to be treated as zero fee transactions and not relayed by nodes.  So they may never confirm.
-mintxfee=&lt;amt&gt;	Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for transaction creation (default: 0.00001)

Only those paying more than about 14 cents per kWh for electricity will turn off their miners.  That is the current electricity cutoff point to cover the cost of powering on a S9 type miner (0.1J/TerraHash).
Don't expect a drop in the hash rate.  Any miners really turned off permanently are just likely to be sold and end up somewhere with cheaper electricity.
What will slow is the growth in difficulty as few new miners will be purchased.

There is nothing stopping a miner ignoring segwit transactions and just building a block with non-segwit transactions. For them nothing has changed.  So anything possible before is still possible.
It is also still unclear if Bitmain are using AsicBoost in a big way.  AsicBoost is a well known way to theoretically slightly speed up mining by using better mathematical algorithms but does have some tradeoffs. 
It requires a special chip design and would impose restrictions on how the chip could be used, for example ASICboost would probably not work with a public pool as the pool allocates the work.

Miners will indeed earn a smaller and smaller Block reward after each halving. By about 2032 99% of all Bitcoins will have been mined and by about 2100 mining will be working on the last Bitcoin.
But miners also receive the transaction fees when a block is mined.  This is currently about 5% of mining revenue and growing.  So it will always be profitable to mine as long as Bitcoin continues to be used. Miner revenue will just move from the block reward to transaction fees.

Nodes don't do anything but validate and relay transactions.  Controlling the majority of the nodes makes little difference.  Only the miners select what goes onto the blockchain. You would need to control the majority of the mining power.

The miners would love to fill them.  It just takes time to reset after a block is found.  The number of zero blocks has fallen over the past year as mining software has got better and relay networks improved.
You could argue that miners should sit idle until ready to start mining a fuller block.  But this may be an advantage to the miner who found the previous block as they could prebuild the next block and start mining immediately. 
Also zero blocks do provide some security function as they lengthen the current valid chain thus providing an addition confirmation to earlier transactions.

Technically in 12 hours you have 72 blocks on average.  The error in the hashrate ( 1 SD) falls with the squareroot of the number of samples. It is about the 1/squareroot(72) or about 11%.

Segwit increases the bitcoin network capacity from about 4 transactions per second to about 7 transactions per second.
Bitcoin transaction rate is limited to one megabyte of transactions per 10 minutes on average.  Segwit increases the capability by moving part of each transaction, called signatures, out of the one megabyte area.  This allows more transactions to be placed in the one megabyte block, thus increasing throughput by about 70%
You don't need to do anything yourself to use Segwit.   You just need to use a Segwit enabled wallet.

The rate is hard coded deep into the way bitcoin works.  In fact you could say that bitcoin mining is structured the way it is to enforce this 10 minute average interval.

Segwit in the real world gives an increase in block size to around 1.8MB, not 4MB.  
Transactions in a block are still limited.  As I understand it the limits are
1) Total transactions in a block ignoring the scriptSig part of  transactions is still limited to 1 MB.  The block is still compatible with older blocks which is why Segwit is a soft fork.
2) The size of the non scriptSig part * 4 plus the scriptSig part * 1  must be less than 4MB.
The only way to get a 4MB block is if the transaction consists of nothing but signatures.

Difficulty changes occur every 2016 blocks.  The next bitcoin change occurs in about 640 blocks, say 4.5 days.

Bitcoin cash have improved/fixed their bitcoin difficulty algorithm.   It was called an 'attack' by some but it was just miners acting rationally to maximise their profit.

A currency needs to be stable and maintain stable relationships with other currencies. 
Bitcoin volatility would make running a business in that country impossible. Bitcoin regularly swings 5% in a day.  The local bitcoin price of anything imported or exported would have to be adjusted every few hours.  Bitcoin wages would need to be adjusted daily.  Loans and investment would be impossible to manage.
Bitcoin is also deflationary which means there is no incentive to spend.  A currency should be slightly inflationary to encourage people to spend rather than hoard money.  With bitcoin people would just save in the expectation of rising value, relative to other countries.

The number of satoshi (21,000,000 * 100,000,000) just fits in a standard IEEE floating point number so satoshi can be added and subtracted by floating point with no loss of precision. It requires 51 bits of the 53 available bits.
In the early days of bitcoin some code used floating point, possibly including some of the original Satoshi code.  As well many languages use floats for library calls and a number of languages, including JavaScript, internal store all numbers as floating point.

You can never know the instantaneous hash rate.  Just a rough estimate based on the last x blocks.
To estimate the hash rate you need to know the average block solve time.
The block solve times follow a Poisson distribution.  You get an estimate on the average block solve time, and thus hash rate, based on the last x blocks.  
For bitcoin, with an average bitcoin block solve time of 10 minutes,  the standard deviation % error in solve time is 100 / sqrt(number blocks).  This gives a standard deviation error of 8.3% for 144 blocks (1 day), 4.5% for 504 blocks, and 2.2% for 2016 blocks (difficulty change).  The variation will be within 2 Standard Deviations of the true value 95% of the time.  
So even with x equal to 2016 blocks (normal fortnight hash adjustment time) the hash rate is only known within about 2% of the true value.

The relevant part is in Satoshi's words "My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess.  It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it's locked in and we're stuck with it.  I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that's very hard.  I ended up picking something in the middle.  If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be worth less per unit than existing currencies.  If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.  Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000.  There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small.  For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1."
Note that a bitcoin being worth 100,000,000 satoshi is just a human convention on where the decimal point lies.  Internally bitcoin works with satoshi, not bitcoins.

Variance can explain that assuming you were comparing the 24 hour hash rate to the new period.  At the time there were say 200 blocks solved in the new period.  The approximate error on hash rate calculations is 1/sqrt(n) where n is number of samples.  So error in value was around 7%.  So differences of 10% between values are quite possible.
You need a thousand or so blocks to get a reasonably accurate indication. That is why difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks.  Even then the error in the hash rate adjustment is around 2%. 
Of cause a lot may yet happen before all the activation period blocks are totalled.

Satoshi always expected there would be 'big server farms' rather than lots of small miners.   
From Satoshi - July 29 2010.
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."
Remember Bitcoin was designed as a way of doing financial transactions without needing trusted third parties.  That is what was meant by decentralization. Bitcoin is not about decentralized mining.  It is about the ability to do financial transactions without a mutually trusted party.
The big issue with Bitcoin is whether it should also support large numbers of small value transactions, or whether that is the role of Visa and similar centralized systems.

I'm sorry but I don't believe "first confirmation is always within 10 minutes." That is not how Bitcoin works. The block solve rate is an average of 10 minutes with a Poisson distribution.
This means there is a 37% chance (1/e) that a block will not be found in any 10 minutes period.  
So even if you were the only Bitcoin user, on more that a third of days you would have to wait more than 10 minutes for a confirmation.

So, unless I am missing something, the BW-LK1401 does not have the lowest power consumption in the industry.
Incidentally 16nm and 14nm chips are very similar, it is mainly a matter of nomenclature.  TSMC call their chips 16nm, Intel and Samsung 14nm.

Hardcoding a time delay would be easy to bypass.  There are lots of ways.
There would be nothing to stop someone changing their copy of the code to have a shorter delay, say 5 seconds.
They could also change the code to generate blocks with the incorrect time in the block header and again find repeated blocks.  
Finally people can change the time on their miner.  If they set their miner to have a time 10 minutes in the future they would continually find blocks even without tampering with the code.  As Einstein would say, time is relative.  
Forcing a delay, by requiring a certain amount of 'work' between blocks, keeps everyone honest. A known delay is created without depending on some form of timer.

It was never intended that everyone would or could mine coins. 
As Satoshi said mining would end up centralised - 
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."
Bitcoin is not about mining.  It is about electronic transactions providing "a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. "

Not feasible with current mining.  Each GPU would run at say 1 gigahash/s.  You would need close to 4,000,000,000 GPUs to approach the current network hashrate.
Each GPU would currently earn about 2 cents per month with free electricity. 
5 GPUs would earn about 10 cents per month.  You would have difficulty even being able to withdrawing your earnings from a pool.
An ASIC miner like an S9 is equivalent to at least 10,000 GPU cards.

It appears you are on an ADSL line rather than a broadband line.  This is not ideal for a full node.  Your upload speed of 0.45 Mbps will limit how many connections you can support.  0.45 Mbps is only 50 kilobytes per second. 
You also need to check your monthly upload limits.  A full node can upload hundreds of gigabytes per month.
There are a number of options, the simplest is to leave your router unchanged with port 8333 closed and just be limited to 8 in and out links.  But keep an eye on the amount of data being uploaded.

Mining is still very profitable for the dozen or so large mining setups around the world. 
Basically you need lots of electricity (megawatts) at under about 8 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). Under 5 cents per kWh is better. This is normally only available near large hydro plants with surplus power.
You also need to be able to get cost effective bitcoin miner hardware. The most efficient bitcoin mining hardware (SP50s and 14 nm miners) are not available to the general public.  It is more profitable for the manufactures to mine themselves than to sell them.
Of course there is nothing stopping someone mining as a hobby.  It has just not been profitable for most people for a couple of years.
Not everyone involved in Bitcoin acts for financial reasons.  In particular the entire node infrastructure of Bitcoin is provided by 'volunteers' who make their computers and network access available for no direct financial reward.

If you want to go way back there have been debates since 2010 on the sensibility of requiring a hard fork to change blocksize after satoshi lowered block size to 1 megabyte. 
This is from 2013 when it was expected that bitcoin would soon have much higher transaction volumes than 3 to 4 transactions per second
In late 2013/early 2014 transaction fees were as high as now 
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:23:21
Send on the weekend when fees are low, frequently well under 10% of weekday fees.  On some weekends all transactions are processed, even those at 1 satoshi/byte, the minimum fee.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:29:01
Transaction fees alone are currently about $250,000 per day, say 80 million dollars per year.  That by itself would keep miners going.   The block mining fees are an extra 700 million dollars per year to miners.
I suspect that even if bitcoin crashed to 10$ there would still be miners.  Less profitable miners drop out, the mining difficulty adjusts, and mining goes on.
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:15:02
The fee of 90 satoshi/byte is about half of what you needed.   viaBTC likes a minimum fee of 100 satoshi/byte. The backlog is falling so you may be in luck.
If your transaction is not confirmed after 72 hours the bitcoins will be returned to you.
See 
@_date: 2017-04-05 05:19:03
I would suggest you consolidate, or send, your very small transactions on the weekend.   You can probably use 20-30 satoshi/byte for the fee, saving yourself a couple of hundred dollars.
There is normally minimal, or no,  backlog on the weekend.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:58:11
No part of the transaction fee is kept by Coinbase.  It is the miners fee.  
The fee also depends on the time of day and the physical size of your transaction (number of inputs).  If you have lots of small amounts as inputs into a transaction the fee can be large.
See 
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:26:32
Some people would say they are already doing that with their current reluctance to increase block size thus requiring higher fees.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:25:24
It should be possible to check the block and see if transactions are in rough order of priority based on satoshi/byte.  The asicboost optimization is likely to have rearranged them into a more random order.  As I understand it the optimization is based on rearranging the transactions.

Unlikely.  There is no sign of a killer use or need.  Most people have quite simple financial needs. 
Bitcoins are far harder to use than Visa/Mastercard.  The world is moving from cash to credit cards, with 'pay and swipe' for low value transactions. Bitcoin does not offer any advantage for the masses.
As well Bitcoin has major volume limits because it is decentralized. Bitcoin can only scale if we go back to using trusted 3rd party providers to provide off chain transactions.
But that does not mean it cannot be successful.  Lots of things are successful without being used by the masses.

Segwit will approximately double the transaction throughput to say 7 to 8 transactions per second or about 200 million transactions per year.
As I understand it lightning type technologies will further increase capacity but to what extend will depend on how frequently lightning users need to access the blockchain.  
It the average lightning user does 6 blockchain transactions per year lightning type technologies will support about 30 million users.  If they do 3 blockchain transactions per year 60 million people could be supported.  This will depend on how much bitcoin users are prepared to lock up in channels.
Further user increases will depend on hard forks to increase the blockchain block size, thus allowing more transactions with the blockchain.
It is also possible that large exchanges, for example coinbase and others, will start to co-operate and act like banks with most transactions being internal within their own channels.
Visa type throughput, with close to a billion users and tens of thousands of transactions a second, is quite a long way away for bitcoin.

The concern is that it is possible to speed up almost any algorithm if you toss money and hardware at the problem.
For example the 'script' algorithm was used by Litecoin and others rather than using SHA-256 so that mining could be done on PCs.  But then KNC brought out the Titan ASIC script miner.
Someone else has mentioned a memory latency sensitive POW algorithm.  But I suspect that if there were hundreds of millions of dollars to be made by mining someone would again bring out specialized hardware, possibly using SRAMs or eDRAMs.  You would end up with big miners having cheap electricity again dominating.

Customers could indeed do transactions off the Bitcoin block chain but that is little different to dealing with a normal 3rd party provider.  
The customer would first need an account containing Bitcoins (or USD) with the off chain provider.  
Then Bitcoins could be automatically deducted from the user's account depending on what was viewed.  
The user would presumably enter a username/password/code for their account, rather than Bitcoins, to pay for views. The provider would need to meet KYC requirements.
In summary the provider manages the transactions, and the user's account/wallet, using a private database rather than the Bitcoin blockchain.

2) Once the Nonce field overflows you can either increment the extraNonce field and adjust the Merkel tree,  or adjust the time field.  The ExtraNonce field is described in the wiki page you referenced.
3) The time value does not need to be very accurate.  A block time can be out by about 70 minutes and still be accepted by nodes.  Clock inaccuracies are why later blocks sometimes appear to be created before earlier blocks.

Ho Ho Ho.  Christmas lights may use millions of kWhs per year but mining uses billions of kWh of electricity per year.  
Modern LED Christmas lights are quite energy efficient, and are only on for say 200 hours over Christmas.  Lets say there are 1000 million sets of Christmas lights, each using 0.5 kWh over Christmas.  This gives 500 million kWh for Christmas lighting.  Mining on the other hand uses say 50,000 million kWh over the year.  Even if you assume some old incandescent Christmas lighting, energy use still does not approach mining.

Miners generally mine via mining pools.  So all the miners in that pool share the return when a block is found.
Mining is only likely to be profitable if you pay less than about 5 cents per kWh for electricity.
There is nothing wrong with running a miner as a hobby.  You would contribute to the mining pool and receive any shared reward.   But this is likely to be less than your electricity cost.
    Q. How many different people are mining?
    A. No-one really knows.  We can only see the blocks found by mining pools.  
        Mining pool owners would know how many people contribute to each pool.
    Q. How close are we to 51% being in one person's hands?
    A.  Reasonably close. A pool controls all the blocks found by miners in that pool.  
         But don't panic. No-one is likely to reach 51% and even if they did are unlikely to damage themselves.
    Q. Can you make money off transaction fees if you never win the block reward?'
    A. No. The transaction fee is part of the total block reward.
    Q. I'd like to support the network somehow but don't want to burn lots of electricity.
    A. Just run a full node.  You don't have to be a miner to support the network.
    Q. A 21 machine doesn't mine right? Would one antminer get a block ever?
    A. You chance of winning a block by yourself is tiny. Most miners belong to pools.

Actually there are 100 million satoshi to a bitcoin.  So there are 2,100 trillion satoshi (2.1E15).  Say 7 billion people in the world gives 300,000 satoshi each.
Also there is a belief that the total number of satoshi  (2.1E15) was set by the need to allow the number to fit in a 64 bit floating point number with a little spare for arithmetic.
The 21 million bitcoin limit, and number of satoshi in a bitcoin, is just a human convention.  Satoshi could have said a bitcoin has a million satoshi with a 2,100 million bitcoin limit and nothing would have changed.  The real limit in the bitcoin protocol is the number of satoshi.
Finally Lightning works with a millisatoshi, which is a thousandth of a satoshi.  It rounds down to the nearest satoshi when moving the value to the blockchain.

Coal/gas/nuclear electrical generators reduce their electrical generation when demand falls.  Wind/solar networks are usually in addition to coal/gas plants so the related coal/gas plants just reduce production.  Few networks have times when they have electricity that they cannot sell to someone.
No-one is going to build a mining operation that can only run a few hours a week.  They need 24*7 surplus power.

Re 4)  every node (miner) trying to find the proof-of-work hash bit pattern starts with a unique starting point.  The miners IP address is part of the starting point so they don't all start from the same value.   The first miner to find the proof-of-work hash bit pattern may not be the fastest. 
Your points 1) to 6) are long out of date. Satoshi originally expected the proof-of-work would be done on PCs. In fact specialist hardware was developed for the proof-of-work calculations, called ASIC miners.  This resulted in steps 2) 3) 4) and 6) being only done on specialist nodes with ASIC hardware assistance (miners).  What people now normally call nodes only do steps 1) and 5).
So most nodes no longer try to build blocks and solve the proof-of-work.  Only nodes with the ASIC mining hardware now do this.  Pools are just a way many people with ASIC miners can share one node and thus the block rewards.

There is about 1 chance in 40,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 that a particular hash is valid.
2) The overflow field (extranonce) is currently 32 bits (nExtraNonce) but could be made any length.  It really is just a simple way of generating a new merkle root.

A blockchain is simply a way to store data.  It does not need a crypto currency.
If the users of the blockchain find sufficient value in accessing the data to make it worthwhile to support a distributed blockchain it can run without a crypto currency.  A blockchain is simply a distributed chain of blocks with each block containing a hash of the previous block as a guarantee the previous block was not altered.   As long as the blockchain is within a limited set of users, say a set of banks,  it could definitely work without a cryptocurrency.

The time that blocks are created is always an approximation as the generating computer time usually has a small time error.  We don't know if the time difference is really 17 seconds.  For example in about 2% of blocks the time stamp is earlier than the previous block, so in about 2% of cases it looks as if the blocks were mined out of order.
Bitcoin just requires the time on a new block to be roughly within 2 hours of the previous block.
Also the timestamp is part of the block header, meaning that it's part of what gets hashed in the PoW process.  So how frequently it is updated may depend on the method used to calculate hashes.  It could easily be out of date by the time the block is submitted.  The timestamp can also be used as an additional nonce.

There is no average electricity price per country. Electricity prices vary widely across regions.  Industrial users can receive very substantial discounts.
The cost of mining bitcoin will fall by about 15% in 3 days when the difficulty next adjusts.

The old KNC Neptune.  They are from 2014.  They were wonderful machines when they first appeared but expensive at about $5-6,000.  Miners were expensive.
They are no longer cost competitive unless you have free electricity.  
Also some had hardware issues with the PCI-E connectors.  KNC ran the connectors at the very limit of what was possible.  It draw 300W per cube through 1xPCI-e connector and needed solid wiring to the power supply.  The full Neptune with 5 cubes drew close to 2,000 Watts.

There is no intrinisic value based on the electrical cost to mine.
Very simply people will mine if it is profitable.  Those whose electricity price is too high will drop out.  The amount of mining follows the bitcoin price, not the other way around.

The article does not say there is a fixed $610 breakeven price for mining to be profitable.
The article says that assuming a purchase price of $500 per Terrahash (0.5M per Petahash) and $50 per month/kWh for hosting you need a $610 price to be profitable.
Assume other purchase and electrical/hosting costs and the breakeven changes.    For example the S9 is well under $500 per Terrahash.  The major miners keep their real costs well hidden.

It is likely to make little direct difference.  Based on previous experience it will lead to a lot of speculation that the price will shoot up but afterwards will prove to be a non event.
It is still a way in the future - mid 2020.  It is known and predictable.  Miners earings will fall from say 13.5 BTC per block (with fee) to say 7.5 BTC.  The impact is likely to depend on fee levels at the time.

Would depend on local laws but should be OK as long as it was clear that the alternative form of payment is agreed before the sale.  Basically fiat must be accepted as payment unless something else is agreed before the sale.
The sale would still need to meet local tax and record keeping requirements so would still need to be recorded in local currency.
There may also be tax implications when the received bitcoins are sold due to capital gains or losses,so you would need some sort of accounting system to track the bitcoin values.  Alternatively you could use Coinbase or Bitpay retail systems and immediately have them convert the BTC to local currency.

Variance.  
Statistically the standard deviation varies at the square root of the number of samples.  So if there are 144 blocks in an average day the standard deviation over a day is around 12 blocks or 8%.  So the hash rate will regularly vary within about plus and minus 10 to 20% of the true value.
Even over 2016 blocks the hash error is about 2%.  So the regular difficulty adjustments are only accurate to about 2%.
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:29:51
Fees are already at about 10-20% of miners earnings.  Even if fees never increase this is more than adequate by itself to keep miners running.  
Blocks will always come about every 10 minutes.  The mining difficulty changes every couple of weeks to keep mining at this rate.

There is no agreed mempool.  All miners have their own mempool and they can make it any size they wish by controlling which transactions they accept and how long they hold unconfirmed transactions.
So all you would do is entice miners to keep their own mempool small to maximise profit under your new profit algorithm.
Fundamentally miners can mine whatever they like as long as the created blocks are accepted as valid by nodes.

The calculator is mainly targeted at the smaller miner.  For them the bandwidth, real estate and administrator cost are zero as existing facilities and space are used.
The cost of electricity is the main cost in bitcoin mining.   Most large scale mining occurs near hydro plants with surplus electricity.

You can work it out for yourself.
Go to  and download bitcoin price and difficulty csv files.
Then make an assumption on hardware efficiency at a time, for example currently 0.1 J/Gigahash for the S9.  This gives you the energy used.  You then have the information you need to work out return on mining at any time, ignoring the initial hardware cost.
Alternatively simply graph difficulty divided by bitcoin price, against time.  You will see the difficulty is the highest it has ever been against price.

With lightning your coins are still on the blockchain.  They are held in a multi-signature address as long as your channel stays open.
The transactions inside a channel are bitcoin transactions, but they are not broadcasted to the bitcoin network as long as the channel stays open.  The channel keeps track of transactions. 
Conceptually you can think of a channel as a totally safe exchange that you can move money into that internally does the bookkeeping between members of the channel.  There is also likely to be links between channels.
When the channel is closed the final state of the channel is added to the blockchain.
There is no mining in a Lightning channel and it cannot operate on its own.  It is completely dependent on the underlying bitcoin network for security. A channel needs to continually monitor the blockchain.

No one really knows.  All you can do is try and guess in which country a block first appears.  But this just gives the pool location.
The larger pools presumably track the location of people who mine on their pools but I doubt they make this information public.
For what it is worth three of the largest mining pools are Chinese – Antpool, F2Pool and BTCC Pool.  Bitfury is located in Georgia and other central Europe countries.  There is also mining in Canada and Washington State.  All these areas have cheap hydro power.  There is also some mining in Iceland using geothermal power.

Bitcoin mining is fundamentally a game of luck where you can turn electricity into bitcoins.  You get some bitcoins if you guess the number that meets certain requirements.  This is done using hardware called miners.  The miner has dedicated hardware that tries enormous numbers of guesses each second.   On average a block of 12.5 bitcoins is found somewhere in the world every 10 minutes.  It is only worth it if your electricity is under about 6 cents per kWh.

Depends on local electricity prices, which usually vary across a country and by customer.  Very roughly the point where mining becomes unprofitable with current difficulty is cents per kWh times 485.
For example at current mining difficulty:
1 cent per kWh breakeven price is $485
3 cent per kWh breakeven price is $1,455
5 cent per kWh breakeven price is $2,425
7 cent per kWh breakeven price is $3,395
Of course this breakeven price changes every 2 weeks as the mining difficulty changes. Most large scale miners would pay under 5 cents per kWh.

The 10 minute interval meant that even a user on a slow internet link in 2009 could mine.  In 2009 most people had download internet speeds below 4 megabit/second and upload speeds below 1 megabit/second. Sending a 1 megabyte block could typically take at least 20 seconds on a good day and even a download took a few seconds.  10 minutes gave a good margin of safety on the slow 2009 Internet.
Litecoin is basically bitcoin with 2.5 minute interval, 2016 block difficulty adjustment and halving after each 840,000 blocks.

Until the miners are shipping we will not know the miner performance.  Lots of big companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, make announcements about new products that do not pan out as expected. 
Also the B3 planned electrical efficiency (33 Terrahash at 3417 Watts) seems to be similar to the two year old 16nm S9.   This is a little surprising considering the move to 7nm.  The main advantage seems to be physical space saving compared to an S9.
We will see how the B3 goes after November.  It should be an interesting end of year as by then we may have the Antminer S11 and Canaan 7nm miners.

Agreed.  A blockchain database is of no use just within an organisation.
De Beers are aiming to have a blockchain database where various producers anywhere in the world can add details of valuable diamonds to a blockchain database and then customers in retail outlets anywhere in the world can check where a diamond was mined based on the diamond details.   See 
One interesting characteristic of blockchain databases is that records can only be added, unlike a normal database where records can be added, deleted, or changed.
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:45:07
Cost of mining an additional bitcoin on S9 type miners (0.1J/Gigahash) depends solely on your local electricity cost and the current mining difficulty.  
For example at current mining difficulty the incremental cost of mining a bitcoin and breakeven bitcoin value is:
1 cent per kWh breakeven bitcoin price is currently about $500
3 cent per kWh breakeven price is about $1,500
5 cent per kWh breakeven price is about $2,500
7 cent per kWh breakeven price is about $3,500
This breakeven price changes every 2 weeks as the mining difficulty changes. Most large scale miners would pay under 5 cents per kWh.
If bitcoin price falls miners turn off miners, thus difficulty falls and remaining miners become more profitable.  There is no fixed 'cost to mine a bitcoin'.
Another way of looking at it is the network hash rate is currently about 42,000,000 Terrahash/sec.  Typical miner efficiency is 100 J/Terrahash giving network power use of around 4,200 Megawatts.  In an hour 75 bitcoins are mined.  This gives 56,000 kWh per bitcoin (4,200,000/75).  
So with current difficulty the incremental cost to mine one bitcoin is the cost of 56,000 kWh of electricity.  This changes every two weeks in proportion to the difficulty change.

There is a lag because it takes time for miners to be manufactured and installed.  Many miners were ordered six months ago and have only recently been shipped.  A couple of months ago there was the equivalence of 100,000 S9 miners being installed each week.
The hash rate has now caught up to the bitcoin price.  If you pay more than about 12 cents per kWh it is not worth even powering up the miner.  Don't expect any further increase in hash rate unless the bitcoin price rises.  
There is now a surplus of unused miners.  
@_date: 2019-09-07 12:27:35
Correct.  The transaction fee was $700 not $10.  The $700 fee brought the 13,611 bytes on the blockchain needed to store the transaction.

Much the same as now if bitcoin just remains a store of value.  Bitcoin has risen 10 fold in the last year with little impact.  The total value of gold would still be much higher the bitcoin even if a bitcoin was worth $100,000.

The gap between blocks is over an hour a couple of times a week.
The average time between blocks is 10 minutes but the interval between blocks has a poisson distribution.  The chance of the block interval exceeding x minutes is e to the power (-x/10). so for 60 minutes it is e to the power (-60/10) or 0.0025.  This means that there is about 1 in 400 chance the interval between any two blocks will be over an hour.

Probably the Antminer S9 brought direct from Bitmain. Say $120 per Th/second.  The Canaan Avalon 7 would be second at around $140-150 Th/s.  
Second hand miners may be even cheaper on a TH/s basis but that is because no-one wants them.  A second hand S7 is an economic alternative and may give the best TH/s but requires twice the electricity of the newer models.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:44:39
The interval between blocks has a poisson distribution.  
If the average time between blocks is y the chance of the block interval exceeding x minutes is e to the power (-x/y).  
If say somewhere between 25% and 50% of BTC hash power has currently moved to Bitcoin Cash the interval between blocks on the BTC chain is currently say 15 minutes giving a probability of e to (-94/15) or 0.002 of interval exceeding 94 minutes between any two blocks.  So unlikely but not impossible.  
If half the hash power has moved the average interval is 20 minutes, giving e to (-94/20) or 0.01 so 1% of BTC blocks would have a gap exceeding 94 minutes..

Almost impossible to say if dip for a few hours is  due to floods destroying miners.  The normal variation in hash rate over 24 hours is about 8% and for shorter periods it is even higher.  (Technically variation is (1/sqrt(N)) where N is the number of blocks mined as blocks are poisson distributed.)
As well there is the equivalent of close to 3 million S9 miners in the world, so a noticable drop in hash rate would mean many hundreds of thousands of miners out of action, not tens of thousands.

There are a number of ways it could work.  We will look at the worse case, where the vendor does not purchase using BTC.
In summary the vendor pays the 'bank node' to initial set up the channel.  Then each night the channel BTC balance is reset back to the 'bank' end and the 'bank pays the vendor the fiat (or in BTC) for the vendors total day's sales as a transaction separate to the channel.
In detail 
1) the initial setup would be that the vendor deals with a node we will call the central 'bank node'.  The vendor buys X BTC from the 'bank' and this is then used to open the channel with all the BTC at the bank end.  In this example the vendor would have to commit a value equal to at least a peak days sales to set up the channel.
2) During the day BTC is moved from the 'bank' to the vendors balance in the channel as transactions occur via the well connected 'bank' node.
3) At the end of the day the vendor settles up the channel by returning the BTC to the 'banks' channel balance and receives fiat (or even BTC) in exchange from the 'bank' as a normal transaction separate to the channel.  Everything is ready for the next day.

Miners are flooding out of the manufacturers.   In the current 2 week period the global mining hash rate is expected to grow by about 10%.
It is just that the miner manufactures find it very expensive to sell small orders to the general public.  Costs are high, especially support costs,  and the public will turn on you for even minor defects in hardware, shipping or support.  It is more economic to mine yourself, or only sell into partners who buy million dollar orders and who can support themselves.
At the moment only Bitmain sell to the general public.  I suggest you keep an eye out for the next Bitmain Antminer S9 or R4 batch.  Second hand S7s are available but expensive, especially if you have to pay shipping costs.  Possibly the Avalon A7 will eventually be released to the general public.

Miners do take the highest fee per byte transactions.  
There were few blocks solved (generated) over the past 12 hours so the system was running behind for low fee transactions.  Your fee was comparatively low so miners did not select it until now.

The main historical reason is that a mass market retailer would not accept 0 confirmation transactions from a walk-in walk-out customer, and no-one wants to wait around while a Bitcoin transaction confirms.  Even on a totally unloaded Bitcoin network you need to wait.  There is regularly a 30 minute delay between blocks being found. 
Other reasons include that everyone already has a credit/debit card, there are few people who would prefer to pay with Bitcoin, and the retailers don't see the cost of training their staff and installing appropriate systems as worth the effort. 
The companies that currently accept Bitcoin normally use an external provider who converts the Bitcoin to local currency.  The company never actual touches a Bitcoin.  For example Dell pays Coinbase to collect Bitcoin payments and convert the Bitcoin payment to USD which is what Dell actually receives.

Fee is 15 cents (0.0001BTC) per transaction so could get expensive for someone if the transactions are confirmed.
The transaction may not affect fee calculation as the transactions are at 25 satoshi/byte, well below current active transaction levels.  
There does not seem to be a large jump in mempools.  Possibly all 174K transactions are from a long time period.  There were about 500 transactions in the latest batch and then a previous batch about 4 hours ago.

Not certain allowing unlimited block sizes would work.

Bad article 
Fees are there because you are buying space on a limited resource, the blockchain.  The more inputs the more space you need.  Blockchain space is the scarce resource.
The author seems to incorrectly think that fees are higher for transactions with many inputs because they "need more computing power to process, thus, require a larger transaction fee.".  This is wrong.
Space on the blockchain is what you are buying. If you use the space inefficiently you pay more.

The blockchain with Segwit can support about 200 million transactions a year assuming 4,000 transactions per block.  Without Segwit it is half this.

The method I have used is to make a pass over the blockchain, extracting the data needed into a file and then sort the file into the order you need the data. Then you can make a pass over the sorted data processing as required.
For example create a file with 1 record for each transaction input and 1 for each transaction output. The inputs would start with the to-be-used transaction hash/ID then "A" then data. The output records would have the output transaction ID from script, then "B" then data. After sorting the file the linking data is grouped together.
You can then make a pass over the sorted data as the linked records are now together.  You could then sort the output to group by addresses.
To keep the sort manageable you may want to do it day by day or month by month removing completed transactions and accumulate results.

That can happen when a block is found soon after another block.  
Once a miner is aware a new block has been found it takes a few seconds to remove transactions that were in the previous block from their mempool, and build a new block.  During this time they search using an empty block.  The only transaction in the block is their reward transaction. 
Such blocks can occur several times a day.  See the block 9 blocks earlier, block 435,027.

Not denying there is congestion but the size of mempool, and number of unconfirmed transactions, depends on the version of software being used and the parameters.

With no blocksize limit it would be up to the miner to decide on the block size.  Smaller blocks give less chance their block will be orphaned (even with the relay network).  Larger blocks would give more fees.  
Ultimately the miners would decide the block size based on the fees earned.   Fees may still be an issue as it will be up to each miner to decide what goes in their block. 
Delays would still remain as there can be long gaps between blocks.  After a long delay between blocks, say 60 minutes, the next block may be very large indeed. You could in theory have blocks of hundreds of megabytes.

How will it get pushed out?  
As I understand it, which could be wrong, the mempool will only start pushing out transactions when maxmempool is reached, say 300 MB.  By then you could have several hundred thousand transactions in the mempool.

Normally an empty block is mined within a few seconds of the previous block. Miners try mining a dummy block for the short time after a new block is reported, while they abort current mining, clean out mempool and prepare the next full block.  
Normally any empty blocks occur within about 10 seconds of the previous block.

A minor point.  The halving does not occur at the same time as a difficulty change.  It will occur one third of the way through a difficulty change as 420000/2016 = 208.333.
So after the halving there are 1344 blocks, or about 10 days to the next difficulty change, not 2016 blocks.
Agree with the other comments that halving will not result to a major turn off of machines. 
65% of the hashing network is under 6 months old. The hashing network has tripled in size in the last 6 months.  Most of these will be 16/14nm miners. Those machines will still be profitable after the halving.  
The only 28nm miner with any chance of being profitable after the halving is the S7, and then only in really low electricity cost areas.

It is a guess based on a fall of about 25% in difficulty at the halving.
Try the Bitcoinwisdom calculator based on S7 figures and current eBay S7 prices.  You need to do it in 2 steps, 25 bitcoins/block till halving then 12.5 bitcoins per block.  You can adjust the S7 hashrate to compensate for the hashrate decline after the halving.  It does not look good for the S7s.

At $1 million dollars the total Bitcoin value would be towards $20,000 billion dollars.  This is far larger than the total US money supply.  So it is not going to happen in the near future.

Say the phone's miner runs continuously at 6 gigahash for 1 Watt, you would currently earn about 10 cents a week in Bitcoin.  Just one downside, you would need to charge the batteries every few hours.

It is very unclear where the data in this article is taken from.  For example where does "The current average fee is almost 15 cents per average bitcoin transaction size of approximately 500 bytes." come from.
There needs to be a link to the claimed data source of "a new bitcoin fee estimator from Bitmain".
Maybe I am missing something but the figures given in this article don't seem to match data such as    This shows an average of 30-40 Satoshi/Byte. For 500 bytes this gives 15000-20000 satoshi or about 7-10 cents.
Blockchain.info shows over 200,000 transactions per day for a total fee of $20,000.  Again this comes to an average fee of under 10 cents for all transactions.  
I am also unclear on what the Bitcoin Halving mentioned in the headline has to do with transaction fees.  Finally I am not certain BigchainDB is an unbiased source of information.

Using standard computer hardware will not work.  Currently the electricity cost will always be 1,000 or more times higher than the value of the Bitcoin mined.
Assume you use really efficient hardware, say a good graphics board, you will get 2 Megahash/Joule. (
This is equivalent to 2 Gigahash per Kilowatt.  So over an hour you would earn about .01 cents for a cost of 10 cents worth of electricity.
(0.01 cents is 2*$0.00004876 from  earnings of Gigahash/Hour)

There is no such thing as a fixed cost to mine a Bitcoin.  Everyone has a different cost of mining.

The ones still making money will continue.  As some miners drop out the others will find blocks faster.

If it goes over 1 Bitcoin it becomes unprofitable for some people, who then reduce their mining.

To answer your direct question. A Bitmain S7 runs at an efficiency of 0.25 Joule/Gigahash.
So 1 GH/s would take about a quarter of a Watt using a modern ASIC miner.  So running the network hashrate, as it was in mid 2010, would take less electricity than a mobile phone charger.  
Of course a modern ASIC miner is thousands of times more energy efficient than a 2010 PC miner and a bitcoin is worth 10,000 times more than in mid 2010.
In summary the network hashrate depends only on the value of the mined Bitcoins and the energy efficiency of the mining hardware.   If the value of Bitcoins changes so ultimately will the electricity consumption and network hashrate.

Basically if Bitcoin mining was profitable everyone would do it.  It is now only profitable with really cheap electricity, which generally means locations in isolated parts of the world next to hydro dams with surplus electricity. Think industrial sized Bitcoin mining farms in western China, or Washington State.  
If you pay over about 6 cents per kWh for electricity forget making money from Bitcoin mining.

Point 2) There are 1344 blocks from the halving to the next difficulty change, not 2,000.  The halving occurs a third of the way between difficulty changes (420000/2016 = 208.3333).
Point 5) Even if 20% of the hash rate immediately stopped it would only take the time between blocks to about 12 minutes. And it is unlikely 20% of the hash rate would immediately stop.  
Point 4) As some miners drop off the other miners find blocks faster than they did before.  So miners who are still profitable will not have a 50% drop in earnings, 20-30% drop is more likely.   
As well a large proportion of the very large increase in the hashing network over the last 6 months hash is presumably new high efficient 14/16nm miners. Most of the hashing network is under 6 months old and is still growing despite the imminent halving.  Someone is betting a lot of money that they will still be profitable mining.

It is likely the transaction will time out after 72 hours as the fee is only 107 satoshi/bytes.  At over 58,000 bytes the transaction is very large.
I would suggest waiting till a weekend when the transaction load is lower and then consolidating your inputs with a lower fee.  This weekend may not be good as the price rise has driven a lot of bitcoin activity.  
As you know you have about 323 inputs into this transaction with most inputs worth 9 cents or less.

It is interesting that the fee on the original unconfirmed transactions is the same as the transaction size.

Most merchants do not accept 0 confirmation.  The average confirmation time for a bitcoin transaction to confirm is currently about 4 hours with the medium time well under that.  
Some sites are even claiming that the medium confirmation time is still around 20 minutes.

As well the merchants often do not deal directly in bitcoin themselves.  Instead Coinbase or similar actually process the bitcoin and do the conversion to local currency for the merchant.  The merchants may never see a bitcoin and Coinbase does the hedging.

SegWit works by moving some signature information out of the traditional block and carrying it in a separate area.  SegWit blocks consist of the traditional 1MB block plus the signature data giving a 'SegWit' block.
In theory SegWit blocks can look like blocks anywhere between 1 MB and 3.7 MB in size depending on the multi-signature transactions mix.  
Experiments on testnet show 1.7 MB is likely to be a reasonable block size average based on current multi-signature transaction mixes. This means it is likely SegWit will ultimately give about a 75% increase in throughput. 
Raising the traditional block size to 2 MB plus Segwit would raise the average SegWit block size to about 3.4 MB giving about a 340% improvement (SegWit2MB).

Empty block is to be expected when one block is found immediately after another.  Here the time difference from the previous block (474,848) is 0 seconds.
This is because it takes miners a few seconds to adjust mempool and build a new block for mining after a block is found.  During this short period their hardware works on mining an empty block. Blocks found within a few seconds of the previous block are normally empty.

Al Gore (Vice President) was pushing the internet.
There were 1.7 million computers connected and traffic was growing at 20% per month, doubling every 4 months.
The big battle was how to get more bandwidth into homes and businesses. Dial Up, ISDN, ADSL,  Cable and fiber were options.  There was a sudden deregulation of Telcos and ISPs sprung up everywhere. Access was frequently via dialup. It has been estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States in 1994
eMail was everywhere. Bulletin boards were common (ftp, Archie, Jughead, Veronica).  Video was coming. Mention of WAIS for database searches. 
But interesting no mention of criminal activity or the World Wide Web (WWW).  The WWW did not really take off till 1995.
The one area I do remember from 1994 was software piracy. Bulletin boards usually had quite a stack of games.  I am not certain it was viewed as criminal activity.  It has been estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States in 1994.

Disagree with the claim that the largest miners make less money than a year ago.
It is likely most miners being installed now are 14/16nm with efficiency of around 0.1 J/Gigahash.  This is better than twice the efficiency of the Antminer S7 and several times better than older miners
KNC taped out their 16nm miner early last year and have had silicon since last July (Solar chip).  Bitfury has announced and demonstated similar chips.  So the only 2 non Chinese large scale miners have moved to 14/18 miners. We would have to assume Bitmain and the other Chinese manufactures also have 14/16 nm chips.
Massive numbers of these much more efficient 14/16 miners seem to have been rolled out over the last few months as the large scale miners replace their 28 nm miners.  In the last 2 weeks the hashing network grew by 8%.
So with the combination of very much more efficient miners and higher bitcoin costs I would suspect the largest miners are more profitable now than a year ago.  They just have to cover the development costs of the move to 14/16 nm chips and make certain they are still profitable after the halving.
The sad thing is that the small hobby miner has been ignored.  Possibly after the halving one of the manufactures will find it is profitable to sell, and support, a consumer orientated 14/16nm miner.

Segwit is a little more complex than just saying it is 2 MB.  My understanding, which could be totally wrong,  is that the 1 MB block size remains but the signature in the new SegWit output types is now stored in a separate structure outside the 1 MB.  The part of the transaction in the 1MB block continues to be included in the transaction hash and thus in the 1 MB block hash. 
This has the potential to eventually allow possibly twice as many transactions in the core 1MB block.  Old nodes see and accept the 1MB block part while Segwit nodes see a traditional 1 MB block plus a witness area that can be up to 3MB in size.
This is all done by having new output types, in particular Pay-to-Witness-Pubkey-Hash and Pay-To-Witness-Script-Hash.  Increased block capacity after SegWit is introduced depends on nodes using the new SegWit transaction types.  It will be interesting to see if it does double current capacity.

Bitcoin mining is now done by large organizations running mining farms in areas with low cost electricity, generally surplus hydroelectricity.
It is no longer possible for a small player to even buy modern Bitcoin mining hardware (14/16nm).  And even if you could buy the hardware you would need extremely cheap electricity.
This is not just a Bitcoin problem. The Alt coins have the same issue.  If a coin is profitable you only have a short window to mine before the difficulty rises so high you need cheap electricity and access to cheap hardware to make money.  If it is profitable people will flood into it.  Ultimately it is dominated by those with cheap electricity and cheap access to the hardware.
@_date: 2016-07-13 08:21:25
Correct.  The amount of electricity currently used depends on the value of Bitcoins and to a very small extent on fees.  It does not depend on the number of transactions.
Miners earn 1,800 Bitcoins per day.  With Bitcoin just over $650, miners make about $1.2 million per day.  Say half of that goes on electricity, miners will use about $600,000 of electricity per day.  As the value of a Bitcoin rises and falls the miners electricity consumption will also change as they adjust their mining to the changing Bitcoin value.
In summary it is currently the price of Bitcoin, not the number of transactions, that determines the amount of electricity used. 
Ultimately the amount of electricity to run all the world's Bitcoin transactions will depend on the total Bitcoin fees.  Miners would then effectively be fighting to see who could get these fees.  Each block would represent 1/144 of all the fees for that day.  Segwit and future 'sidechains' may totally change this by allowing transactions without Bitcoin fees.

Since 0.12 priority mining based on age of coins has been disabled by default.  There have also been changes in the way mempool works for 'free' transactions.

Miners are continually performing hashes on 256 bit long values in the hope that the resulting hash value falls below a certain target,  If it does the miner has mined a block.
It is like the world's largest guessing game.
Each 2016 blocks the value of the target range is adjusted to keep the number of winning blocks to roughly one each 10 minutes.
The target value is the reciprocal of the difficulty value.  When the difficulty rises the target range gets smaller making mining harder. When difficulty falls the target range gets larger making blocks easier to find.

There is never a precise historical Bitcoin/USD value.

The big delay in Australia is Postal Voting.  The 1918 Electoral Act allows 13 days for Postal Votes to arrive so counting of all seats and the Senate cannot be finalized till 13 days after the voting date.  This is because, back in 1918, it could take a long time for mail from remote areas.
Agree electronic voting (blockchain?) would help but a week could be removed immediately if the postal voting times were changed. About 10% of Australians postal vote.
The other possibility is to start forcing people to move from postal votes to pre-polling day Web voting as in the NSW state election.
There is already a level of automation. For example the paper Senate voting sheets are electronically scanned and counted.  See

Cost depends mainly on electricity cost but the most expensive miners will always be mining at around the current value of bitcoin.  Once the mining cost exceed the value of the bitcoin, miners stop mining, so the breakeven cost to mine one bitcoin is always the current value of a bitcoin.   If the cost is higher it becomes cheaper to buy bitcoin rather than mine.
Bitcoin was presumably at around $6,000 when the claim was made that the breakeven point was $6,000.
Current breakeven cost is presumably heading towards around $3,500.   Mining difficulty is currently falling at about 15% each 2 weeks.

May not be that easy.  They would have to outbid everyone else for fees.  
Generating a large number of low fee transactions would not accomplish much.  They would just keep mempools full but would be ignored by miners.  Nodes could greatly increase the minimum relay fee and also have automatic memory limits.
You would need to spend more that the current $50,000 worth of fees per day to do anything.   If you were prepared to spend say $250,000 per day on fees you could probably drive average fees to around 1 to 2 dollars based on 250,000 transactions per day.  
If you were prepared to spend several million dollars per day on fees you could really drive everyone else out.  The miners would love it.

No.   Watts and Watt hours are totally different units.
2.46 terawatt hours over a year is the total energy used.  To convert to Watts you need to divide by 365*24.
2.46 terawatt hours is equivalent to 0.28 gigawatts (2460/(365*24) ) not 2460 gigawatts.

Gold has two factors which tend to stabilize the price of gold.  These factors are lacking in bitcoin.
1) Worldwide gold production varies depending on gold price.  When price rises gold production worldwide tends to rise.  Similarly when gold price falls production falls.  This acts to stabilize the price.  On the other hand with bitcoin production stays at 1 block every 10 minutes irrespective of price.
2) Gold is widely used in industry, particularly electronics.  For example each smartphone has about 50 cents worth of gold.   As gold price rises usage by industry declines, if price falls gold is more widely used. This tends to stabilize gold price.  Bitcoin does not have this use in manufacturing.

There appears to have been a drop of about 4% in the network hash rate over the last week.  This has moved average time between blocks to about 10.5 minutes.
But over a day or so this is swamped by normal variation.  For example just now there was a 67 minute delay between blocks 422,131 and 422,132.  Yet in the next 60 minutes 9 blocks were found.
The mining difficulty should reduce slightly in about 9 days to compensate for any network hash fall.  But just looking at the date from one day can be misleading as daily variation is likely to be greater than the underlying hash rate change. 
Technically the standard deviation of a poisson distribution varies as the square root of number of samples.  Over 24 hours the standard deviation is 100 / sqrt(144)% or about 8%.  So there can be rapid short term swings just due to normal fluctuations.  As theymos mentioned an hour delay is not unusual.

Blockchains are no magic bullet.   While there has been lots of experiments almost no large blockchain based projects have actually gone live.  
A typical problem with blockchains is that there is a delay between transactions entering the network and the transaction being included in a block. Blockchain based systems are not ideal if you need rapid information distribution, for example in a financial system.  Message bus based systems can be better if you cannot use a centralised system.

In 20 years time a block fee will be just under 0.2 bitcoin (5 halvings).  That is 28 BTC per day.
Transaction fees per day are already frequently higher than that.

As well as the standard block mining incentive from creating new bitcoins, the miners also collect transaction fees.
At some time between 2030 and 2040 it is expected the transaction fees will exceed the earnings from creating new coins.
Note - the bitcoin creation part of the miners earnings halves every 4 years.  The transaction fee part will at least stay at the current level and will certainly increase if bitcoin becomes more widely used.  Even at current fee levels fee earnings will be greater than bitcoin creation earnings by 2040.

Empty blocks are generated by all pools.  For example F2Pool generated one today (471045).  They normally occur within a few seconds of the previous block.  It takes a few seconds for the miner/pool to build a new block and restart mining after a block is found.  While this is happening they try to mine an empty block.  
Half filled blocks are a different issue.  They are generally Antpool related.  Seems strange as they are missing out on revenue.

For the private chain to be substantially longer the private chain miners would need to find more blocks than the rest of the network miners combined.  This means the private chain has most of the network hashing power.  There was a concern a few years ago when one pool approached 50% of the network.  People changed pools to distribute the load more evenly.

Draper would need to have a fee around 0.5% if he is to compete with Visa and Mastercard. 1% is too high.
In Australia the fee to the merchants is normally around 0.5%, less for debit cards and higher for credit cards.  Visa and Mastercard fees are generally picked up by the merchant.  The customer never sees the fee. 
In many places almost all purchases are now made using cards, generally using "tap-and-go" if under $100.  Where a fee is added it is usually 0.5%.  No place has a Visa or Mastercard fee of 2%
