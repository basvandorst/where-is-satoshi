This was a pleasant little ray of sunshine in the shitstorm that is today's posts. Thanks :)

I finally got cleared for Gemini during this 8 day pending transaction, I think I'll switch on over :) how are those fees?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:59
But at least it keeps things interesting... amirite?

Same boat my friend, it seems that we are stuck with this whole hodl crowd for at least 4 more days before the price gets back to where it was :p

I got in at the beginning of January. I'm down ~800 USD, and I love it. The blockchain tech is incredible, and once you dip your toe in, the crypto world sucks you in and you are surrounded by all this unfamiliar wonderful stuff to learn. I highly suggest getting involved, because when you invest in crypto, you begin realizing you must also invest in yourself, and your knowledge base, and that is the best thing you can do for you.

True, I just like the idea of banding together and sticking it to the man you know?
Better yet, we could all just buy crypto with money we have.

Genuine answer: that's not your money to spend. It is the bank's money. That is what credit is. They don't stop you transferring money from a checking account because hey, that's your money, do whatever you want with it. But when you use credit, that is the bank giving you their money with the promise that you will pay it back in a timely manner. They have analysts that figure the risk in investments, and the risk in crypto is too high due to the volatility of the market. Put yourself in their shoes:
A friend approaches you and asks you for a thousand dollars. "What for?" You ask. They respond, "I want to buy bitcoin. I promise I'll pay you back, look at how much money I can make if I invest it!" You see that the value of this investment is capable of dropping to half its original value in 3 days. Now where is your friend going to get the money to pay you back?

It's a matter of checking your fomo at the door and waiting to get in after a correction (though no one knows when that would be anyway so what's the point of saying it). I fucked that up and bought at 14k, had a processing time of 9 days and watched it drop to 9k in that time, so I learned my lesson pretty quick

Stop shilling flushable farts, it's a shitcoin and we all know it

Precisely what I was trying to get at with this post. I didn't think it needed the update, but damn people on reddit are savage
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:58:21
If you're not using the cc to spend money you don't have, you should have no problem using your checking account.

Thank you for pointing this out. I am an anthropologist, and not many people know this about the cultures of India. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:35:36
I'm not, I don't like the idea of using credit to buy crypto, it's a stupid idea. But people on this forum are up in arms about it so I'm providing a possible solution.

My god, a Rick and Morty clip with BTC imposed in it. This will be wonderful. 
It was wonderful.

If I'm correct in my assumption, this thread moved to a post-apocalyptic scenario, in which case gold has no value. You could maybe use it to blind your enemies on a sunny day, but at that point you might as well just get a mirror.

Plot twist: this is actually where the term cryptocurrency comes from

This advice reminds me of football coaches that say things like, "well we just gotta get out there and score more points, that's how we'll win this game"

To repeat in different words:
All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain have a miner's fee. This is a nominal fee that goes to the mining community for their efforts of keeping track of the blockchain or ledger of every transaction. These fees add up due to the large number of transactions that take place every day, and so there is enough money in the miner's fee pool to entice miners to continue keeping the blockchain alive.

Based on other market trends, one can make exactly the educated guess that this person made. At some point, the market becomes so unstable from the monumentally fast climb that the statistical probability of a correction means that it pretty much already happened. People learn from the past, others are doomed to repeat it. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:23:58
I would suggest Gemini. They have lower fees and, imo, a more professional, cleaner interface.

Those folks probably have it in place to pass their wallets on to someone else, or transfer funds upon death
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:54:25
How did it work out for you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:40:29
The same people. You've got to recognize the power of television media. They can run a campaign for two or three months that says "the return of bitcoin is here!" and they will all come back into it
