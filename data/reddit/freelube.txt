I once went out with a really slutty girl for a few months who was really into showing off her tits on cams. So I got her setup for bitcoins and directed her online webcam performances; split up earnings 50-50. Made myself a small fortune. This was back when BTC was about a buck and change.

Ayn Rand was a selfish little slut... she's like the mother of all the tea party douche bags.
“Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It’s simple. Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of humor is an unlimited virtue. Don't let anything remain sacred in a man’s soul – and his soul won’t be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you’ve killed the hero in man."

In the meanwhile, make sure you send your godfather (also known as IRS) your yearly extortion payment (also know as tax) for the Bitcoins you mined or exchanged last year... so Obummer can buy more F-35s. Can't we just nuke the Chinese or the Russians instead?

Damn lies and statistics... they will do anything to keep you believing in "the system". It's more profitable for preppy 1% schools like these to provide four scholarships of $5,000 each to affluent students who will be able to pay the balance easily than it is to provide a single $40,000 grant to one low-income student... and they already INFLATE tuition that way, so it doesn't affect their bottomline... And then they brainwash schmucks like you into believing they are doing God's work.

Get ready for a world of some serious butt-hurt when the agents show up at your door and give your some first class corrective center hospitality for exerting your FOIA request right. I hear sometimes you can request lube before they butt fuck you.

From my experience at Foxwoods, they are more than happy to give you a check for your winnings. If the money was from collecting from your business, you are better using an actual service like Brink.

Stop spreading this dollar cost averaging fud...
Lump sum investing can result in better returns. Lump sum investing can often result in better returns because you have your money in the market longer. Dollar cost averaging also means making more transactions, which can result in higher brokerage fees.

So I decided to head to the strip club to blow off some steam from today's precipitous selloff and guess what my luck continues to go from bad to worse... my regular hoe refused to accept bitcoins for the dance, so I fondled her boobs, smacked that ass, quickly paid cash and bolted before the bouncers can butt fuck me.

Keep up the good work guys. Don't let the pussies here distract you. If they want to get butt-fucked by governments, IRS, NSA ... well at least please do ask for lube. For everyone else, lets go dark. Fuck this public blockchain.

Ok guys. Public service announcement for my American friends... also applicable for other countries like China or Russia if they ban BTC and throw you in the gallows for just owning it:
1. Always use Tor
2. Always use non-US based pools for mining BTC, LTC and other altcoins
3. Always access pool websites via TOR
4. Always use an anonymous email accessed via TOR with pools
5. Always access blockchain.info via TOR. Make sure its a new wallet you create from within TOR since they record the SHA256 of your ip address in the wallet. Don't give up any personal info.
6. When you have new coins (either coinbase if you must or elsewhere), send them to Blockchain.info and use CoinJoin sends to a newly created address (maybe 3 times and upto 10 repetitions each). Never merge multiple sources of BTC when sending; else you are just increasing taint.
7. Once its been joined enough, send it to an offline wallet created entirely off the network, again via coinjoin.
8. Did I say use TOR for everything. Create a bootable TOR instance on a USB stick.
9. Always use a new address for everything and use coin control.
10. Switch to another altcoin like DarkCoin or Zerocash when its available for buying/selling your video games, computer parts etc
