It actually looks like blockchain.info wallet allowed them to spend unconfirmed funds. 
 
shows total received: 0.2065 even though 0.0015 of that is unconfirmed. The two unconfirmed tx have zero fee so who knows when they will confirm.

Since this tx will never confirm with your current balance and blockchain.info wallet doesn't remove expired/invalid tx like they should, you will have to import your private key into a different wallet to be able to spend the funds.

You are trying to spend 0.2065 but you only have 0.0205 available to spend.  You are deficient by 0.0015. Im not even sure how you were able to send it.

Yea Im just wondering why blockchain.info wallet changed their policy all of a sudden. If the tx isnt in the mempool then it should be back in my account. At least until someone rebroadcasts it.

The funds will return to your wallet after a period of time determined by the wallet setting of "mempoolexpiry". It used to be 3 days but now its typically 2 weeks or more depending on the wallet. Also once the coin reappears in your wallet I recommend you spend it with a higher fee immediately. Otherwise the original transaction can be rebroadcast, the coin will disappear from you wallet and you will have to wait another 2 weeks or more if it doesn't confirm.
Of course there are ways to unstick the transaction if you dont want to wait. Search for "replace by fee" or "child pay for parent"

It depends on the wallet. I used blockchain.info wallet and its 20 days and the coin is still not back in my account.

I've read the other posts about what to do with a stuck transaction. So I'll try those things before asking for help. I was just curious about why the blockchain.info wallet isn't returning the funds to the address. I remember it used to return them after about 4 days if not confirmed. Currently 14 days after initial transmission, I doubt the tx is still in anybodys mempool.

At this point you would spend more to confirm a transaction quickly than the cost of the food itself. 
But you can try the transaction accelerator.

Sure. Obviously the fee is too low for the size. But I wanted to try anyway.

cool. Hopefully your other two tx will confirm eventually. Otherwise you may have to do the same thing with those keys.
Also blockchain.info can't really help anyone individually but they can rewrite the code in their wallet to not allow you to spend unconfirmed funds. And also they really need to scrub expired/invalid tx which means the funds would reappear in your wallet.

Seems like a pretty big adjustment (2x frequency). But Im not complaining, maybe the mempool will finally empty out and fees will drop.

Well that explains it. I guess the 2 week expiration was recently implemented. Although its day 15 for me so...
