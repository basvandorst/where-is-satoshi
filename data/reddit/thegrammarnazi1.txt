I'm currently running all the crypto I have on the bot. I want to run more, but don't have more. 
I also want to avoid taking out a loan/borrowing from family in USD and putting it into a crypto market that could fall more than 7.5% a month.
How do I not understand math here? I'm currently working on compounding everything I have but want to put more into a working system. I'm willing to take the risk of a loan, but a USD loan seems like an unnecessary risk.
A BTC loan is actually a great idea, something I hadn't thought of.

yeah, that's what I'm focusing on now until I can get some investment

If I had anything resembling starting capital to work with, yeah, that's definitely true. .18 BTC isn't very exciting, even with compound interest.

I think I'm creating enough signals on big enough markets to grow it. So I'm sure there's a ceiling, but I know I could continue to trade with more size than I have access to.

I was hoping for something like this: 
I can see your argument, but don't care as long as I don't have to share how my bot runs. Some of these companies don't need to see how you're trading, you just have to hit certain benchmarks with both profit and risk management over a month or two and you get funded.
I'm looking for the same thing with cryptos.

My signals are all crypto, I'm avoiding any USD base, so I'm hoping to find a firm who's holdings are crypto.

I'm not interested in selling my strategy at all. I'm looking for a company/firm that allows traders to trade their money.
I have a VERY small amount of capital, about .18 BTC. I'm getting a great percentage month over month, but not enough profit to write home about.
I'm not interested in selling my system.
