We are getting with the program. Visa and MasterCard are moving to chip and pin in the us and forcing merchants to upgrade their cc machines for it. I already have several is cards with it.

Negative interest rates? Wouldn't that mean if you took out a loan for something the loaner would pay the person to take the loan?!

Except use a prepaid card enough and it ups your credit score to where you can get a regular card...

I applaud your attempt to win this fight but it's futile on a sub like this.

The secured ones do.

Wow what kind of back assessed logic is that? Corporations are blameless for bribing, it's only the politicians fault. Really? Wow.

How do you do this? And are your loans guaranteed? Meaning if you loan them 1 BTC you'll always get at least one back?

Such a bullshit argument. In B's case they are just as on the hook as the politician. Bribery of political officials for corporate gain is not solely on the politician, and to say so is ridiculous.

You're wrong. They're rolling out chip and pin in the us as we speak. I have us cards with them on it already and the cc processors are forcing merchants to move to the new cc readers.

Really? A heritage article? To debunk the fact that the Nordic countries really do everything better than us?

Because he's one of those useful idiots corporations like to use to further their own entrenched power over a market. Much like most of the people on this sub who would prefer to be ruled over by corporations or the modern robber barons just because they don't have government in their name.
