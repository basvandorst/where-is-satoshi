@_date: 2018-01-01 18:20:09
No just a beer.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:20:48

@_date: 2018-01-02 12:17:55
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:32:48
Just question...why one over another (ledger vs trezor)?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:39:31
Ur. A bitbro. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:50:55
I think the current fees are causing the trades to be higher. To much spam with small transactions..
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:56:42
Calm the fuck down.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:03:44
Another shill.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:47:14
Not if you have the seed.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:18:46
Big thx!!!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:15:04
How dare you! Bcash is the new bitcoin /s. Lol. R/btc will lose it. Heheheh
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:40:42
I would recommend you dump bcash first chance you get and get money while you can. Bcash is scam. However, research and make your own judgement.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:14:13
They can't regulate btc. They can push shitcoins all they want...we the people...know what is the one...the true decentralized crypto coin...
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:39:27
No they used segwit. Quit with the FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:44
Them? Security is a big issue everywhere and to implement good measures takes time and not just few weeks. Please research.(
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:48:41
Hahaha absurd.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:51:02
 "But technical analysts say the losses could touch as low as 46.5%, pushing Bitcoin down to $1,470."
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:37:57

@_date: 2017-12-25 21:07:44
^^^^ that
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:15:25
Only bankrupt people will be those who invested all they had. Smart individual seasoned hodlers know what they are doing...
So you really dont know what you are talking about. Bitcoin might go to 0 or 50k, but that will not bankrupt me...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:28:20
What this person says^^^
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:42
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:45:15
U r confused :).
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:26:54
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:30:39
We do not act childishly we are just raising awareness so ppl are aware who he is and what scam bcash is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:02:04

@_date: 2017-12-27 19:41:12

@_date: 2017-12-26 12:19:11
^^that. They have their bcash subreddit and should post there. This subreddit here is all about bitcoin. Thx.])*
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:22
Bitcoin.org and read...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:23:48
Yeah but looking further into your picture it show that you are promoting a purchase of bcash.
Thats all./[
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:55:17
Why u got to hate, and who is to say that he knows more about btc than me and you combined. Dont judge people like that my dude..()]
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:33:53
You dont have to buy 1 whole bitcoin...you can buy fraction of btc.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:00:29
^ that and infosec imho...
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:12

@_date: 2017-12-26 11:37:47
Bcash is scammy too...just an fyi...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:57:29

@_date: 2017-12-26 13:57:51
U are a troll.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:06:46
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:15:00
Sell it as soon as you can. Bcash = bcrash..-.](
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:03:21
Well said...they are part of the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:44:45
Get electrum and open segwit adress
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:27:50
I think posts like this are needed to help people not fall victim to bcash scam.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:49:34
What he says^^^...and  btc is constantly under attack from different areas...
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:27:11
Oh well i thought electrum uses segwit...
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:16:49
Miljenko ne kakitos...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:15
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:58:50
Dude do you even know how hard it is to develop something secure for the whole world to use and manager their btcs. Lightning network is taking a while because it has to be 100% and not 80%. Thank you and quit with the BS.
Think security first..][/
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:07:44
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:45:59
Lol i knew something was off...thx.l
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:06:47
FUD big time!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:36:25
Buy hodl sell and more Hodl, have patience and ignore the fud...
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:01:13
Segwit not adopted by those who want to hurt btc...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:23
Omg same 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:32:31
 Good info... i think i want to see btrash under 1k.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:13:06
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:41:06
I bought more..)(]
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:23:03
There was someone here about 3 days ago who gave 25$ worth of btc to first 5 people who responded with their segwit to the post...
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:38:44
Lol. Even then i would stay away from btrash.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:17:11
Possible if the people who wrote it are bcash supporters.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:47:59
Some bought at 7k and it dropped to 5k few weeks ago...they hedl and went to ATH...
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:59:31
I am planning within couple weeks to dump my bcash and get more btc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:48
U got it wrong...buy high sell low...
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:32:03
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:17:04
Go post that to r/btc. You are in the wrong place buddy./[
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:07:39
I feel bad for anyone that falls victim to bcash.
