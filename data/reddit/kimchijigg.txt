Alright I'll keep track of all my movements, and try to limit them so as to not complicate the matter. 
Thanks for the helpful response!

Any recommendations on good radio, podcasts, or other media sources to listen to concurrency news? Not wanting to  listen about the philosophy of crypto, but rather current news and events.  Thanks

where can I follow XBT's performance? I can't seem to find it on my usual platform.

Yes I meant the futures trading on the stock market. Sorry, I didn't realize that was the abbreviation for the Currency as a whole. Thank you for the link.

Thanks for the link, I'll read up on this.  Any more resources you think I should read up on to make sure I'm doing this responsibly?

The past couple of times we see the buys getting close, but never manage to break the wall.  Then it stumbles back down to 16,500ish like clockwork.  Is someone manipulating this and profiting by selling at ~17,245 and buying back in at ~16,500 you think?

I see, so its best to send it to my USD bank, since I feel safer it being there, seeing that it doesn't matter either way? 
What if I were to just withdraw my initial investment? since there is no gain, are any taxes involved in this scenario?  
Sorry if these are questions with obvious answers, but I want to invest responsibly and not get fucked by uncle sam.
