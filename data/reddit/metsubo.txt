Ah, gotcha.

they didn't, they tipped them satoshis.  not the same thing.  those 100 satoshis could be worth a hundred bucks in ten years.

oh i see, when you said you couldn't find a number to call you meant you couldn't find a good number to get a hold of someone?  If you're a writer, shouldn't you be more careful with your words since stuff like this could be used against you as slander or something like that if they wanted to be dicks?

Only in the last, like, year or two.  Does anyone know what the fuck is up with that?  When did American's become obsessed with incest?  Used to just be deep south and aristocracy iirc.  Now suddenly every "popular in the US" section is people fucking their family...

uhh the phone number is at the top of the support page

Yeah I think this is a joke.

22lbs is for 1 million.  100 would be a 2,200lbs wouldn't it?

So in a prediction you have to include every possible price that might show up that month?  Corrections don't mean anything?

Today is making me so happy, I was afraid I'd missed my 10k window.

Either you're doing a bad job making the same joke as everyone else or you've got the worst short term memory in history, because every number prior to 87,00 has 3 zeroes after the comma showing the comma isn't a cents delimiter.

It's considered a scam because he, and bch zealots, constantly try to convince people that bcash is "the real bitcoin" when in fact, bitcoin is the real bitcoin, regardless of what the whitepaper says.
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:34:03
Total BS in this regard?  You don't think this is fully intentional? Did you fucking see how they worded the question in the survey?  You're crazy, dude.

Cash?  You mean federal reserve notes?
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:35:22
It's the other way around. Oil is backing USD because international trade of oil is forced to use USD, but don't you worry your pretty little head about that, China and Russia and a few others have been working hard the last decade or so to change that.

The thing you're forgetting is that if/when fraud occurs you have an immutable record of every step in the chain, meaning its SIGNIFICANTLY easier to identify and rectify the sources of fraud and abuse and remove it from the supply chain.

ugh, fucking tether

It can if you count percent of change over time and add it up though right?. Like if you invest 100$ every day, but Bitcoin has a10% reduction per day for a hundred thousand days = a million percent, no?  or am i missing something?
also that being said I'm in Bitcoin for the long haul, I'm definitely not trying to prove that persons point, mostly just curious about the math.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:18:41
Did they really or are you making a joke?  Cause this shit always happens when they do that.

If it's a windows PC and it's not encrypted it won't take but an hour tops to break into it with a password cracker.

The state is made out of us.  Everybody who works in government is a human being just like the rest of us.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:17:17
And it was the right advice then, too.
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:23:44
They are you under different circumstances, and if you think that's not true you're either a fool or someone who's never been in dire straits
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:27:32
Yeah, because the fire department, public schools, highways, trash and recycling, etc etc don't exist?

I mean that's a fair point, but at the same time you'd be dishonest to say that people don't vote against their own interests on a massive scale anyway, like the electorate isn't innocent here.  Real human beings voted for Mitch McConnel and Donald Trump.  They weren't put in place by the government itself, and they'd be out of a job in the government if people stopped voting for them. 
 Gerrymandering only works if people keep voting for those 2 party members.  It's not the government's fault we have a 2 party us vs them system.  It's the society we live in. People want to win by making sure the other party loses, at whatever cost generally.  If you want proof try to tell a democrat or a republican that you're voting independent and see what they have to say.  100$ says on the most part they either say a vote for independent party is a vote for "the enemy" or that you're "throwing away" your vote.  Voting Independent or at the very least 3rd party politicians is the only way to restore representation to the people.  Voting democrat or republican is just voting for more partisan stonewalling.

that's not the government that's the military industrial complex(includes nsa/fbi/ etc 3 letter agencies and police
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:31:23
which is because the people who prioritize war voted them in.  don't act like you exist in a vacuum.  the people who populate this country determine who gets into office, regardless of what is used to convince them to vote for whom.  if you don't like half your money being spent on war, talk to your fellow citizens and convince them it's bad.  don't act like anarchy will make those people suddenly respect your right to exist.  government is the only thing stopping them from killing YOU
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:38:18
Yeah, except that for the last decade or two every other large economy has been working, without the US's involvement, to remove the us dollar as the global currency standard, and the biggest thing really holding it back has been trading in oil, and when oil finally tanks, pun intended, that will change.  Especially since our current sitting president is doing everything he can do wreck our standing as trustworthy ally

How is it anywhere close to ATH?    It's at 98 and the all time high was 164.72 in February of 1985
The debt argument is decent, though.  Hadn't considered that part, honestly.

All of those companies are now working heavily in the cryptocurrencies space, so of course they're not going to support their direct competition, but those institutions only exist at the scale they are because of the secrecy and corruption inherent to their industry.  The more accountability comes into to play the less influence they'll have.    To specifically answer your question though, Ameritrade is a big one, and they have their own platform now as well.  BBVA and USAA are also two big names that have bitcoin in their portfolios.

They don't have nearly enough qubits to crack encryption yet
