Another reason to never use Bitfinex is that they were one of the first to issue Tether...and did so in order to pay off customers for their losses when they got hacked.
Tether is so damn dangerous, since exchanges use it to transfer funds, that if it crumbled under US pressure, then the whole Cryptocurrency market could see a massive drop.

Don’t use an exchange as a main wallet. You should be sending as large amount as possible to minimize the fees to your personal, private wallet. The private wallet has means to set your own fees. Set to 10 Satoshi per byte. You should use Bitcoin as a store of value, not something to buy coffee with simply because of two things:
High Transaction cost and long times.
I don’t see it going away if you can store it with a high value. As for transactions Alt coins will be superior in their specialty, but this is a Bitcoin subreddit so I’m not allowed to talk about it.

Goodbye BTC. Next time use a known wallet like Breadwallet or a Ledger to store bitcoin. A $100 lesson I’m afraid.

Bitcoin ATM and cash. Sorry but in the US all companies are required to report some form of ID.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:31:01
Yes. Your coins are technically on a public ledger, where those wallets only point to an address which tells you how much money you have. You store and hold onto private keys which lets you access your coins. 
I'd choose a hardware wallet. You could lose your hardware wallet and aaa long as you know your 24 word code, you can get your bitcoin back. Your hardware stores your private keys - no other information is stored on it. The Ledger for example, is basically hackproof (not 100%, more like 99.999...999% secure, or in crypto terms, you'll get Pretty Good Privacy) and you can only confirm transactions if you physically press the buttons and connected to USB for power. It's really awesome cold storage for cheap. 
Of course if you don't want exchanges, hot, cold wallets, or paper, stick with cash....

They did get hacked some time back in 2016, like that should put up red flags. I would never go into exchanges where they have had their security compromised. [source](

Depends on the exchange and how much BTC you're trying to get at one time. For  amounts over 150, places like CoinMama or Coinbase (I'm not sure Coinbase's amount) they'll ask for ID.
Obviously the safest solution is to go to a BTC ATM or Local Bitcoins, then transfer the amount straight to bread. But the post asked about Bread and seemed new to the topic, so I'll try answering with exchange-based coin sources.

I wouldn't put too much personal details. Learn from the aftermath of Equifax :p
Get your stuff though an exchange and transfer to Bread. Coinbase works for small amounts. Only thing you'll put on the site would be financial info which can be cancelled or changed. Photo ID might have to be put in too. Ultimately you'll want a Ledger to just dump coins instead, but Bread does just fine for sub 1 BTC amounts
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:44:04
Bitcoin ATMs, I've seen some with $10k-20K limits with no ID. Only thing to worry about are the high fees.

Ledger, because they're close to implementing Monero which IMO is secure in hiding address values and interesting if they can be the first Wallet with Monero support.
Yes it's a Bitcoin wallet too.

How much are you trading and how often? Definitely put less than what you're willing to lose, and I guarantee it, you might lose it all if the exchange gets hacked. A few mBTC isn't much if you're doing large amounts to just transfer to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:59:07
Start small. Look at some ALT coins too, do your research before getting your feet wet. Bitcoin is nice and all but keep in mind that Alts have higher risks, high reward. Dollar cost average and learn about forks, because Bitcoin is having one soon. Get a wallet with private keys. That said, chill out spending $5k right away because in crypto you could lose it all. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:26:32
I’d hodl midterm since I can’t time the market 100% of the time. I personally would just increase the time interval you’re trading from everyday to every month. I tried basically what you’re doing once before but it doesn’t help with sleep at night haha.

Lookup Mt. Gox on google. They were once the largest Bitcoin exchange in 2013 before getting hacked and stolen and everyone with coins in the exchange lost their coins and couldn’t withdraw. 
Wouldn’t take the risk with Coinbase which is starting to be Pre-Mt. Gox with how many people talk about it.

Read up on Proof of Work. Basically the amount of electricity to mine the bitcoin is so high that it literally costs that much to get one from a computer. No, it’s value is for something, unlike banks which can loan people money out of thin air, Bitcoin has a set value hardcoded (21 million, a mathematical formula that shows mining rate (slows down over time), and open source peer review code that makes it open to anyone in the world to see.
The problems Bitcoin has today is as more and more people use it, the more expensive and slower transactions get. This is because the cost to run a transaction is equivalent to the power of running a few average American homes. And it’s being used quite a bit on markets or money transfers. That’s all I can say as a layman.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:45:04

All exchanges are risky. Best keep your bitcoin in a private wallet with a private key. The FBI seized a bunch of Silk Road Bitcoins once, but since they didn’t have the key they couldn’t access it. The tech behind the Security is pretty good. Just never hand out your private key to anyone else. Ever.

Yeah 1sat/byte is basically nothing.  No miner will confirm it. Need to go at least 10 for any input (which takes from 30 minutes to 3 days depending on traffic)

Keep your private key in a Ledger or Trezor. Keep the recovery phrase on paper only and OFFLINE in a safe. Buy the dip. An amount like that I think you’ll need ID and verification by the exchange to purchase that high. You’ll need a few days to verify in the first place. Bittrex and Gdax should provide what you need.

Lol, with 200 you’re only going to make around $30 not including trade fees, and the fact that sometimes it’ll go down when you time it wrong (timing the Mackey for smart amounts like that, you’ll lose money in the long run. Totally not worth for such small gains.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:55:22
Yeah, this is the cool part of bitcoin. Your private key ie mnemonic seed and you can get your coin even if you lose everything physically. 
You should recover your wallet (might take time syncing the blockchain), and move the money off to a different address with a different seed. 
If you want a suggestion, try Bread, which is an iOS wallet where you keep the mnemomic and private keys and I find it pretty secure since the code and development is now open source. Though the best option is obviously a wallet with cold storage.

All the miners are in authoritarian countries where electricity is super cheap compared to the US. Hence why places China and Venezuela do it because it’s wayyy more profitable there. Plus, they would have farms that’d run 10s of thousands of Antminers.
