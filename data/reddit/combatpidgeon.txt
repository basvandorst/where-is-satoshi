"Coinbase Exchange is not yet available in your state."
False advertising.

I'm not sure how it was implied, if Edward Snowden faced trial here it would be a kangaroo court. It's not about fairness it's about agenda.

Not sure why the article is getting so much hate here, imagine being paid a salary in bitcoin and not knowing if you could make your rent payment at the end of the month while you constantly watch bitcoin charts and can't fall asleep at night. If the goal of bitcoin is widespread adoption it won't happen unless volatility goes down. Where I would take issue with the article is whether a chief goal of bitcoin is even to replace fiat in the first place, the other issue is he assumes that bitcoin can be pegged to a big mac (a reference to the big mac index). No reliable solution exists for a CC to be pegged to the dollar or a big mac, it's out of the bitcoin community's control.

Heey something about bitcoin I can comment on and not feel like an idiot. One thing bitcoin is missing is a derivatives market, if something like this existed, it could possibly reduce bitcoin volatility and further bitcoin adoption. If people could do covered calls (ex: buy 1 bitcoin, sell one bitcoin call @ 425 for april) this would attract more investors, also people who want bitcoin but are afraid of downside volatility could hedge by buying puts. This would also bring context to how the market perceives future volatility of bitcoin. Now don't get me wrong, I have no idea how to achieve this beyond btc exchanges stepping in, just some food for thought.
The next pipe dream would be for a way for companies to raise money by selling equity right into a blockchain for bitcoin. Imagine companies IPO to a decentralized blockchain and shares can be purchased for bitcoin. Now obviously this would never fly in the US, but we may be able to exchange shares of companies raising money in free countries.

Oh nice to see someone working on it. I'd be worried about the margin system and risk of defaulting.

Just wait until they have access to all your phones.

Transaction took me 6-7 hours earlier. Low fee was paid. Miner preference was low.

Japan businesses would have to use the business wallet software, and only accept purchases from customer wallets. These wallets may even only allow transactions between verified wallets. The bitcoin might even only be stored on Japan servers. You just get a portal into it. It sounds trivial to regulate to me. japan.mywallet.gov

Hacker: Give me half of the btc in your vault or I reverse all transactions indefinitely.

I'm wondering what happens to the bitcoin in the coinbase wallet of someone who is banned?
EDIT: yes, downvote my totally legitimate question.

If AAPL is compelled to make FBI sanctioned products then by extension the government is selling you your phones, which undermines cryptography and security principles. By the same token, the government writes your operating systems, controls your ecommerce, controls your currency, audits your phone calls, tracks your internet usage, maps where your vehicle goes. I'm convinced there is no line we will draw when it comes to giving up our privacy to the government.

Japan could make you register your wallet address and not accept coin from unregistered addresses, and bham. Regulated.
Further, they could mandate you use their wallet software with requires you sign into their front end, which maps your wallet address to your name, etc.

If a new coin is introduced and obsoletes bitcoin or splits the market share of bitcoin such that the value of bitcoin plummets I believe you'll drive money out of CC and start a slow cryptodeath. The market is educated on bitcoin now, if they learn that new coins will suddenly be introduced and cause waves it will scare all the money back to fiat. We cannot consider only technical factors, even if a new coin is the perfect instant transaction, infinite TPS coin, it does not mean it will succeed. Consider IPv6 vs IPv4, IPv6 solves every problem of IPv4 and still has not had any real success in replacing IPv4, because the protocol only focused on solving technical factors.
