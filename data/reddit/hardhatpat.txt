THIS IS SO STUPID.
RAISE THE GODDAMN BLOCK SIZE.

They make you wait around for the tx to confirm before they dispense cash.

The ability to download torrents over a network that only allows http/https.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:37:36
Not really, heres a scenario that might happen:
Imagine you're at work early on a saturday morning because your boss sucks.  You'd be much happier watching last nights *Real Time* instead of doing his work, but torrents are blocked on this network.  Solution: Coinado!

I'm surprised Syriza didn't do this day one.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:24:00
For life.

Pretty sure forex markets aren't immature and do have a decent amount of liquidity...

I believe this machine operates at 5% on either side of the exchange rate.  Never used it because of the identification requirements.
I've dealt with the owner personally and he will cash to bitcoin or bitcoin to cash in person for 5% over or under market rate.  No questions asked, no ID required.
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:23:36
Classy too... 
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:35:45
The idea is: Send bitcoins, go shopping or wait a while, collect cash.

I'm still trying to figure out who the victim is?
I thought a crime was supposed to have a victim?
@_date: 2015-05-30 05:43:00
This whole situation brings tears to my eyes.
@_date: 2015-05-11 02:29:22
Who delivers for btc?
@_date: 2015-05-11 02:27:48
Well now you know: magic.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:57:01
You should look in to the "murder for hire" charges further...
The prosecution chose not to bring any of that up during trial for a reason.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:34:08
I feel dumber after having seen this.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:52:06
You're forgetting the $500,000,000 GAW used on paycoin...
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:53:23
This is correct.
I guess people like to down vote others when they're shown the right answer.

If there's one thing I've learned in my 28 years of life: shit takes longer than you think.

I'm incredibly stoked about this service.
What funding methods will you offer?
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:34:51
Take 50 Tylenol and tell me: 


@_date: 2015-08-31 15:38:23
Once they hit 88mph...
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:13:52
So how is this better than a TREZOR?
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:04:21
Sell on purpose?
@_date: 2015-07-09 04:37:06
Currently it costs more to use up inputs and clear up the UTXO pool.
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:23:17
Came here to try to figure concepts are shut down...
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:54:46
Why would you keep your money with them instead of a TREZOR?
Still trying to figure this one out...
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:51:50
You can just send it to me...
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:12:29
Didn't even use a throwaway?!?!?!
Hope nobody finds out who this 'evoorhees' guy is for his own safety ... Jackbooted thugs await!
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:12:21
They don't support TREZOR properly, it only uses the first account on the TREZOR.
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:37:02
I guess I know where to eat next time I go to Astoria...

You realize you've just agreed to let uber collect all of your mobile browsing data, right?
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:28:55
^ truth
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:10:40
Of course an institution that creates money out of thin air is willing to accept finite money...
Don't be stupid.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:21:54
Get that edication on!
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:24:35
Why are we posting old news from a shitty source?
@_date: 2015-09-06 11:54:57
Really?  Just use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-11 05:13:46
This is exactly what the Winklevii are banking on...
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:59:31
I was, it probably is.
Were they shipped USPS? 
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:32:33
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:33:56
What method was it shipped?
I moved since the long overdue entropy was supposed to ship.
Wondering if my change of address will help it find its way to my new house...
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:04:35
You can tumble your own bitcoins for very cheap.  If you have bitcoin sitting around you can offer them for tumbling and keep a small fee when they are used.
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:16:38
Because the risk is extremely low so is the reward, often less than 0.1% per transaction.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:16:00
You Rock!
I love free stuff!

As a recent TREZOR purchaser, I'm not sure why *everyone* doesn't have one of these to store their funds.
I keep my cash in a safe at home, why wouldn't I keep my bitcion in one?  
$119 to protect and control my coin seems like a no brainer.
