No need for LN node.
Neutrino is live on mainnet.
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:20:08
I Dunno.
Also, there will be a thing called Channel factories If Im not mistaken, Which will enable opening multiple Channels in one tx.
Which will further help onboarding onto the LN
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:11:07
Not sure if you get how this all works...
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:57:16
You don’t have to trust anyone if you’re running your own node.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:43:06
You order things...
If You need to be anonymous, You use Monero.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:25:46
The ok on the onchain layer is opening the channel, since you have to deposit bitcoin to the channel to use LN.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:58:36
You can’t.
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:58:53
Playing Numbers essentialy means that you’re betting.
You don’t own the underlying asset, just betting on it.

It’s utility is What gives it value.
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:00:18
You can’t withdraw that Crypto, So you’re not really owning it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:31:42
If the work isn’t valuable, then it has no value.
Stop with that commie crap.
In this case, maintaining the ledger is valuable because people find it valuable.
If no one is using it, then the work has no value.

Last time When the network was congested, I waited 5 days for the tx to go through.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:13:31
Payment Channel is Just a fancy name for a multi-sig wallet.
Imagine You going to a bar for some drinks with a friend.
instead of paying for an onchain tx for every drink, You open a tab.
The only thing is that You have to deposit some money in that tab (payment Channel(multisig wallet)).
Whenever You buy a drink, You sign a tx saying I’m giving X amount of bitcoin to the bar.
But those transactions aren’t touching the chain yet.
They Are signed And valid though.
You decide that You want to send some money to your friend That’s drinking with You, But for some reason You dont have a Channel opened with him, but the bar does!
So, You can route the payment to him through an intermediary, the bar.
For a fee of a few satoshis.
That means that you can route payments to anyone that the bar is connected to.
Payments can hop through nodes.
I have no idea what “layer 1 authorization” means, never heard of that term.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:53:32
Fake news.
LN is even more P2P than onchain txs.
Since LN routes the payment through channels.
With onchain transactions, you broadcast them on the network and the rest of the nodes pick them up.
You can have custodial Ln wallet, just as you can have custodial on chain wallet.
Don’t fall for the big blocker narrative.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:29:08
How do you mean manually? 
It is manually, You have to initiate And confirm to send a transaction, Just Like a regular onchain tx.

Bitcoin core is a different altcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:43:48
@_date: 2019-03-03 00:03:16
Well, technically, “coins” don’t exist, they’re just unspent input/output in the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-03-03 00:31:41
Yeah, it’s more approachable to the general public.
@_date: 2019-03-10 13:45:10
I think you’re in this for the wrong reasons...
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:47:19
It’s not even bitcoin, it’s just a bet.
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:32:59
Haven’t Done much research on nano.
Care to give some links on why nano txs aren’t p2p?

At least BTC is Real.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:57:00
You mean, they bribe people who make the laws.
@_date: 2019-08-04 10:33:53
This should be common sense.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:06:46
One of the devs did forked BTC And his S2X fork failed spectacularly.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:58:32
Schnorr incoming
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:54:08
Exactly, but it doesn’t have anything to do with the hashing algorithm.
@_date: 2019-02-17 10:53:38
Correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:38:05
Yes, quite likely, there was a lack of consensus, the Jews didn’t want to upgrade so they stayed on the old chain.
Very much shilling from their side.
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:26:32
I still dont think that that Had anything to do with the mining algorithm.
Bitcoin cash is a fork, they have the same block history.
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:56:04
Because it’s an online wallet? Duhhhhhh
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:24:44
Jaxx is a shit wallet, Had nothing but problems with it.
Reset the Jaxx cache.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:03:44
I don't see how the mining algorithm has to do anything with this situation.  
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:21:42
Miners job is to secure the network by confirming the transactions. They are calculating hashes with sha256 algorithm.
When they calculate the correct hash and stamp the block so to speak, they propagate it to the nodes in the network which they accept and the nodes propagate it further if the block is valid.
There’s a ton of sha256 coins, how would you able to send bitcoin to another sha 256 coin address? The wallet would say that the address is invalid.
Hashing algorithm is not relevant to the address format.
Bitcoin cash  and bitcoin were the same chain not so long ago, they share the same past up to a certain point.
If one messes up like OP, if they hold private keys for the address, then it shouldn’t be hard to recover the coins.
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:43:08
I don’t get how would a electrum - a software wallet on your computer, is more secure than a hardware wallet which doesn’t let the keys out....
@_date: 2019-02-16 23:03:23
You’re making no sense. You don’t need another device, you can use either or both.
Can you please provide the evidence of hw wallets easily getting hacked?
It’s way more easy to get a malware on a computer or usb if one’s stupid and browses what he shouldn’t.
Since whenever you plug in the usb and open the wallet, the keys are right there to take.
With hw wallets, you have to be a lot more sophisticated.
Plus, I don’t know if dude is tech savvy enough to know how to load Tails on a usb drive and boot from it.

Yeah, a friend was also “really careful” When he was writing Down his seed words... Managed to fuck up two of them...
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:54:16
Yes, you can hook it up to an android phone.
But I don’t have an android, so I’ve never tried it.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:15:10
Yes,that does make sense, but I don’t think that is a problem with 1mb blocks, I don’t think that should be a problem even now with segwit, and segwit blocks are ~2mb.
@_date: 2019-02-17 08:42:15
Dude, the point is, hot software wallet will never be safer than a hw wallet. That’s a fact.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:46:29
You then have to be careful When You spend the outputs And be sure to spend them separately so those transactions can’t be linked together and to you.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:41:47
This doesn’t have anything with cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:07:35
Yes, but also more transactions could be confirmed.
If Litecoin And Vertcoin can propagate a block throughout the nodes in 2.5 minutes, I dont see why Bitcoin couldn’t?
Or Ethereum for example, it doesn’t have a block size cap, IIRC, and the block time is ~20 seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:17:18
SegWit adoption! Only a small part of the network uses segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:36:29
I agree, it’s stupid to constantly bump up the block size and reduce the block time, that’s where the second layer solutions come in like lightning network.
And IIRC, Bitcoin Cash solution is just to bump up the block size whenever there’s a problem like this, which is insane.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:11:20
Shhhh, don’t let them hear you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:13:19
So Litecoin and Vertcoin are insecure because of 2.5 minutes blocks?
And Ethereum is really insecure because of the 20 seconds blocks?
@_date: 2019-04-29 00:56:49
Yes, I definitely do, I'm new to this.
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:52:18
Is there a guide on how to do this?
@_date: 2019-04-29 00:46:51


Might be a stupid question, but how do I connect my phone to my node?
@_date: 2019-04-28 23:41:17
@_date: 2019-04-28 23:20:32
Would greatly appreciate it!
