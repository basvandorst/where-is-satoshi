bitcoin cash seems to pump in cycles. maybe the ratio will improve better for you possibly if you want to switch back?

Well I don't know anything about IRC. I admit I read the new posts in dogecoin everyday. I have not witnessed a negative post being deleted but I am not saying that its not happening though. I like to keep an open mind. Anyway I found the subreddit that keeps deleted stuff. I am sure it will be useful to you at somepoint in the future for something. I did not realize it existed until the whole blowup.

do you have evidence of that?

merry Christmas to you!

I think some of you are missing the point. I think that if the cameras did not even capture the doge car at all and there was zero media attention on the car it STILL would have been worth it. If you were watching the online stream with all the shibes they were going crazy rooting for the car! Everytime someone spotted the car even if it was at the back in spot 34 it was very exciting knowing that it was "your" car out there... I think the media exposure will get a couple thousand extra subs and that will be about it... but I think the if you check subreddit out and see how happy everyone is right now I would argue that its bringing the community together and that is worth a lot!

so heres my question... some speculators say then in a few years bitcoin could be worth like 20,000 or 100,000 USD. now I think that is far fetched but lets say that it happens.
if bitcoin can be broken down into 1,000,000th of a coin that means if it was worth 100k you could only break it down to 10 cents. or if it was worth 20K then it could only be broken down to 2 cents.
wont this be an issue eventually?

there is that subreddit that archives all deleted content... I cannot remember the name of it... but how else would you know it was deleted?

just wanted to mention that support cleared this up and confirmed my transaction
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:44:28
well I just tried to buy one yesterday from buytrezor.com... I sent them my bitcoins... then they canceled my order dispite receiving the bitcoins + enough confirmations in a hour... I guess I may be a 1 off? support is not responding to me. and no they did not refund my bitcoins.

depending on how much you have you might want to invest in an offline wallet like trezor or ledger. i think if you have 1 bitcoin or more you should definatley invest in one... if you use your PC everyday i worry you might get malware on it and it might be just as bad as having it on coinbase.

I am no expert but i chose to use Gemini. You cannot sell your LTC on Gemini though, only ETH and BTC.

i wonder is there something in common about the blocks they are including? would be interesting to know if they are purposely excluding transactions of a certain criteria

I actually bought 100$ worth of dogecoin probably at the peak of its hype and forgot about it. I checked how much my dogecoin are worth now... $430. Infact it has the exact same % return as all the bitcoin I bought. So if someone had invested all their money in dogecoin they would have the same amount of money if they had invested all their money in bitcoin which is humorous.
