Perhaps you are right, but I for one do not care what a child at University thinks.
Writing is on the wall, your just too young to see it.  You'll likely have a few more opportunities after you squander this one.
Who know what the future brings.  learn from your mistake and be ready not to make a fool of yourself on the next go round.
I have a BBA - Finance and have a heck of a lot more experience in the markets than you do friend.  
Everything about its economics says it is a buy.
You do realize that Twitter is trading at a market of $33 billion based on its projected 2015 earning yes?
This is a bit of a different animal as it is much like a commodity that will needed in the future.  Supply and demand Kemosabe.  
Yes, it is easy for you.  Part of growing up is to realize, it is not about you.  It is about business and business dictates that Bbitcoin will be implemented.  How did you miss that from my previous post?  It isn't about your fees, it is about the retailers fees to Visa. 
Why go you think Zynga adopted BTC?
They sell items in their games for like $1 or $2 at a time.  But with BTC they can sell them at a smaller increment and more specific want of consumer.  It betters the transactions for both.  Better service equals longer play, which equals more transaction volume ultimately.
Perhaps.  Maybe not.  
It will all play out.  your bet is made, my bet is made.  We will see in the next year or two.
You know kid,  You have to take some risk to make real money.  No one get rich putting money into a mutual fund or Googlge at 300 billion market cap.
You distain for BTC gives the illusion of risk, which is great for those with the balls to take a chance at these levels.  
The futures favor the bold.
I know you don't have any money so you are angry at the nerds getting rich.  I was angry as well, but I will be damned if I let a bunch of nerds get rich while I start bashing so I put a toe in the kool-aid and it was awesome.
Feels good to be validated by the price rise, but it is ultimately inevitable in my opinion.  Don't let your self fulfilling desires blind you to what is happening right in front of you.
Maybe it is your impatience that is blinding you.  
You know, Rome was not built in a day, neither will thebitcoin network be built in a day.  But when it is mature in 5 to 10 years.  Holy yowza.
If you were talking about the pennies I would be on board with you, but you are talking about Bitcoin.  Bitcoin man.  Get yourself together.

Do not listen to these idiots dude.  Get a cryptsy account and put some of that BTC in there.  Then look at teh coins, find ones with decent fundamentals, that is, not going to have billions of coins coming onto teh marketplace over teh next 6 months and buy and wait for them to go up.  take profits, and then invest in another or the same after it pulls back.  
The tenants of investing are simple:
News moves markets, so look for coins that have news coming up.  Most people are stupid and lazy, note the other posters here, so they will only buy when teh news in here, that is when you are selling.  Buy a month or so out and sell on the news.
Again, Fundamentals matter, but momentum is also important.  you have to take some risk to win, but try to invest in the uptrend, not teh downtrend.
Also, sometimes, you can not win, and sometimes you can not lose.  Alts are in full on pull back at the moment.  be careful.  Wait for the bottom.  Historically, alts miners average $16 a day  by mining the high avg coins at coinwars.com with 3300 Mh/s.  They are at $40 a day now, so we could see another 50% drop across the board.  Best to stay in BTC until the trend reverses.
That is about it.  But yes, a portoin of your portfolio should be in Alts, just not right now.  You can flip yoru BTC for more BTC.  the cool thing is that if you buy LTC you are hoping LTC gains against BTC and BTC gains against USD, or you could go down even further, into IFC or something that trades against LTC.  Then IFC can gain against LTC and up teh lines...but I do not recommend anyof that at the levels., look at the past performance, and watch out for news.  it moves markets.  
Last thing, always remember, everyone but you is an idiot.

I think you should realize that the tipping point has likely been reached, from consumers adoption in 2013 to commercial adoption in 2014.  This can of worms is now open and the industry set in motion to implement and capitalize on it.
 
It is not what can you buy with Bitcoin, but what you want to buy on the internet in ~2015 that requires you to use Bitcoin.
 
It changes to some extent the monetization model of the internet.  Think Cable TV that you pay for and also have ads fed to you.  Impossible until this very moment. Paywalls have been tried, but Bitcoin makes it not only more feasible, but a requisite to use certain websites.  It will create a feed back loop as well.  Better content at the big sites that require Bitcoin.  Opportunities at the fringe for ad based only models but why would they pass up the stream of income.  
 
As a content provider which model would you choose?  The browsers will have the wallet built in by 2015, so it is up to the content provider to choose a revenue path. more money or less money?
 
Spoiler alert:  You will not be able to use the internet the way you want without Bitcoin.
 
That is why you buy Bitcoin today.  Because everyone will be buying a little to put in their wallets in two years.
 
Quick math.  US, Japan, and Some of Europe has 594 Million Internet users.  
 
Say that 1/2 of them buy $20 a year in BTC to access high end content.  That is $5,940,000,000 or roughly 1/2 of current BTC valuation.
 
That is not even close to what will be reality.
 
There are 2,840,000,000 internet users in the world. Some obviously richer than others.  
 
But the number that will spend $20 a year is going to be quite large.  Many will spend much more than this annually.
 
Now think about the other services that Bitcoin provides.  More efficient and less expensive money remittance, less expensive payments with no charge backs and a low barrier to entry.  And more!
 
These obvious truths are in front of you.  Hopefully you realize it soon.

Wrong.  Altcoins are healthy as ever  Do not be threatened.  Will they ever be a Bitcoin?  No, but they fill an interesting space in the ecosystem.
Please note how closely the web traffic of Cryptsy follows the BTC chart.  Alts provide a great derivative play on BTC, where-in folks play a game of trading in a much more interesting marketplace to gain Bitcoin.
Just like satoshidice was a fun way that actually gave BTC value early on, the altcoin markets do likewise.  
You would be wise to realize this and stop talking so much ish.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:21:48
The real reason is because news moves markets and execution/profits sustains them.  BTC grew to fast in value as compared to its utility and penetration. 
Same thing happened to share price of 3d printer company  3d systems.  There is huge promise, but the the market is imature.  Things move slowly price gains will come.  The goal is 10 to twenty years out, not 2015, but we should see gains.

I believe you have to go through the MSB licensing on your own dime, have the net worth to become licensed ,which as a startup trying to get into the field, is questionable.  $100,000 net worth in a new business venture is a tall order.  Then they take 30% of fees until the the fee income reaches $20,000 and 50% of fee income forever after then.
In addition you are on the hook for $1000 in maintenance, the rent, Brinks for money to bank service and other costs associated with the normal course of business.  Insurance chief among them, but there are many others.

Most of bitcoins value it to the merchants that accept it.  The only real benefit to consumers it is in efficient on two front, sending and receiving, and in that you can buy goods at a much lower price.

It is clear that Bitcoin will change how content is monetized online.

the 10% or 15% marginal income tax brackets, then your long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%.
the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% marginal income tax brackets, your long-term capital gains tax rate is 15%.
the 39.6% marginal income tax bracket, your long-term capital gains tax rate is 20%.

If you have questions about the balance sheet or credibility of your supplier, then you do not do business with them.

There will always be a pool that has a relative, if not outright majority, because it gives the air of providing more blocks to users.  This is false, as the hash is higher so you on average will receive the same reward over time, but try and tell that to anyone with serious money invested in mining.  
It will have to be coded as the coding is rational, while human being are not.
2nd thought:  
Over the short term, your chances for return are high at ghash and with how quickly the hash rate is growing, that is actual the only place you should be mining.  
Once the exponential growth of mining operations stops, perhaps we will see decentralization in the mining pools.  However, in a world where it pays to collude and monopolize, if is doubtful.
One side of me thinks that time and resources should be used for more important issue with the core, but perhaps a change is needed now to prevent issues later.
In regard to scaling to global transaction account, we better make sure that miners and pools are incented accordingly going forward.

I am not sure I buy it.
The Fed is simply pushing money into the marketplace as a work around to their typical means of doing so.
They would usually let depository banks make the money supply through lending, but with lending being slow due to the banking crisis residue, they have to do it through QE?
I am sure they are pumping additional moneys in to stimulate growth, or were, but that will be coming down as banks gain footing.

A coin like Globalcoin has 40 second blocks, which do not cause that many orphans.  If you look at fastcoin, there are quite a few.  But 40 seconds and above is not bad.  
I think the 10 minute block time is due to HDD capacity.  
You do not need to wait for more confirms with Globalcoin, still just 6 confirms.
Not sure on Fastcoin.

I will throw my hat into the ring here:
1) It is trustless. You no longer have to pay a bank or other company to make sure that the funds you receive are real and legitimate.  The network knows and verifies in seconds and confirms every ten minutes forever.  
That is very cool 
2)  The network is the largest concerted network ever built as far as I know.  Many orders of magnitude above all of the worlds super computers combined and continuing to grow exponentially at about 18% EVERY 10 DAYS.  It is insane.
3)  Bitcoin benefits people, but also benefits the bottom line of Merchants and that is why it will succeed.  no chargebacks you say?  I think I will impliment Bitcoin.  
4)  Super low fees.  I sold a $200 Star Citizen ship to a guy in Austria( I'm in the US), I got the BTC in seconds, he paid 6 cents on transaction.  That would be about $10 from paypal.
5) Super fast.  The longest you have to wait is 6 confirms.  Even if the network was throttled to hell, you are waiting less than an hour and a half, assuming you want all 6 confirms.  That beats the hell out of 3 business days with some banking transactions.
6)  It will change the internet business model.  Paying a few cents to see content online will become the norm.  Such a better model that ad revenue.  Which will also stick around, obviously.  It is basically the cable television model, but pay only for what you use.
7)  It is cool.

Also bitcoin is undervalued as compared to mining machines at the moment.  Many people will ming at large loss with expectation of btc price gains.  I can mine at a 75% loss if I reasonable except a 401% gain in btc price.  That is certainly a motivator.
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:38:09
I was told that opals are just dingleberries that have dried to the anus, and then were covered by volcanic ash and clay and ultimately water filtered through the clay and ash, leaching out minerals that seep into the dingleberry(and perhaps anus) which then opalised.  So when you wear and opal, you are really just wearing a turd and perhaps a tad of anus.

Forgot to mention that BTC will be the ultimate winner of the Crypto Currency wars, but as it continues to rise in value, many of the alts will enjoy the speculative rise along with it.  Just look at Nov. 16th through Dec. 1st on every single alt coin.  1000% gains.  Will that happen again?  Probably.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:56:35
Don't listen to these people.  I have been using Cryptsy since July 2013 and they only had one problem, when they they were growing super fast in early December.  That is when these trolls probably had an issue.  Crystsy is the alt coin standard for volume and number of coins to trade.  Highly recommended.
If you want volume, which you do, use Cryptsy.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:05:39
Re: alt coins
Dont listen to the narrow minded folk.  Look at cryptsy.com on alexa to see the user growth.  Saying it is a fad is simple minded.
I think a 25% potion in alts is reasonable.  I like wdc,dgc,glc,and ltc.  They are positioned to take advantage of crypto gaining footing over the few years.  Disclosure, i hold glc.  I think it is insanely undervalued.  
But yes btc will be the main,  the others will have tranactional value, and that is brand and thus adoption based.  Gains of 1000% can be seen every few weeks on seemingly random alts.  Market manip, maybe. But have a look at what i have alluded to.  There are only ~50,000 folk at most in alts.  If you are that early to market, you have to know what is up.  Gains.  But look around and keep a health portion in btc even after riding a 1000% flyer.  
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:27:20
I agree with everyone else, but if you look at fiatleak.com, you can see that Bitcoin is only big in US and China, so wider adoption and time.
Browser integration will certain be something that will make for a massive spike.  imagine every browser has a built in secure wallet.
Imagine that dell computers come with a hardwear walllet that you send Bitcoin to and then fund your browser wallet from.

If you do not like it, learn how and change it yourself.  
The pursuit of money is the reason for the infrastructure and the reason you will not be investing in making a not-for-profit exchange.  Read as, put up or shutup.
This is perhaps the last time I will say this truth to you monkeys.
Adoption is now a mandate.  Consumer adoption is now at a point that internet content providers will implement this for premium content.  ESPN, WSJ, Games, Etc.
You Bitcoiner's really just cost people more money to use the internet.  You kind of fucked us.
Bunch of jerks is what you are.  Thank god I have been stacking BTC for 8 months, though.  all of that forced adoption will makes me rich.
So on a side.  I think That hardware wallets will be a standard on PCs in 2017 and that is how you will fund your computer, and then you add smaller amounts to your built in browser wallets to do your internet browsing.
In closing, yes, there is no advantage to consumers except for the ability to self bank and not have to wait or experience high fees to send money.
This is a tool that will nearly 100% be co-opted to increase revenue or at least change the way companies bring in revenue.
But we are a consumer society and Bitcoin is a tool to consumer so will naturally be adopted.

Conventional loans are the government to.  Without gov, there is no meaningful housing market.  Only the rich could afford.  Conventional loans are backs by Fannie and Freddie, which are government sponsoered enities.  they package yourloans into a mortgage backed security and sell bond to bond investors like your bond fund in your 401k.  So when you make a mortgage payment, the bank applies you principal to your balance and send the interest down the line.  When you have paid it off in full they get the full balance to the bond hold as well.
So the only money the bank or Credit union makes is on the origination of the mortgage, and the servicing.  That being saidd, a CU may portfolio the loan and keep the interest payments as well, kind of up to them and their strategy.
the reseason they would use Fannie mae and Freddie mac, is they offload all risk.  They really do not care if you default on teh mortgage after 1 year because they are off teh hock.  The bond holders have pricd bonds so that the risk of default with so many borrowers is inherient in teh interest rate, so everyone wins. 
The banks sell the note to FHA or Fannie or Freddie and walk with the orgination charges(most of which are in a yield spread) and the servicing fee monthly.

Silver is a hedge against collapse cryptos are the absolute growth option.  If they hit like dot com, Bitcoin is a 10 x gainer and some of the middling cryptos could be in the 100s x gains.  You would like sell silver at 3 x.

@_date: 2017-07-06 15:13:50
Both segwit and larger blocks are good.  It fosters fee competition from miners and lightning/other side chain techs.  
Bigger blocks are needed to increase clearing capacity and keep value in Bitcoin.  The segwit allows everyone to build on top of Bitcoin with having to hard fork all the time.  
Both important and needed. The problem is everyone wants all the money instead of part of the money.  That is where we are now and until we get to the plateau at the end of year, things might get hairy.  
Then we do it again in a year or so as Bitcoin needs to hard fork to larger blocks periodically and the segwit utilizers always want to take value from Bitcoin for their side chain products and will fight.

Another example, i started tracking the market cap of the 100th most value alt on coinmarketcap in April.  It was $3.5 million.  Now I don't know, $17 million?  Topped at $22 million.

You must not have been paying attention.  Alts was the only market to have been in from late February to early June.  Those gains were outrageous.  To say otherwise is very stupid.
It was the best market and a very meaningful part of BTC gains during the period.  A altcoin bull market is legitimately the most fun you can have.  Basically ever single one rose 10 x in 3 months.  What a blast. 
I have pulled out of alts almost completely.
I swear to God, I was riding a triple gain in one afternoon and poloniex crashed whipping it all.  I was about to triple my BTC position and it whipped.  There is no rush or rage inducer that is even close.

There was never and will never be a true Bitcoin. Bitcoin is whatever you want it to be.  
If you use it great, but as with everything, majority rules.  If most people think that one chain is Bitcoin, it is Bitcoin.  
If everyone decide litecoin was Bitcoin it would be so.  Bit philosophical there...
But point is, it is fairly abstract and that is why hard fork are scary things.

People are all over Buffets jock.  Why, a great investor, sure, but come on.
Lets get back to the millionaire secretaries from Microsoft, or those folk who invested $9000 in HLS when it was at $0.09 right after Enron happened.  
It is like you people do not have a brain and look to Buffet for answers.  Really dumb.  You as an individual have a brain, use it.
What is remarkable about Buffet is that he has done it right for decades and he has done it will Thousands of dollars and with Billions, not an easy thing to pull off.
That being said, get your head out of his ass and think for yourself.  Ideas make people rich all the time.  Bitcoins potential is one of those ideas.
I know that they are near all time high, but think about where it is going.

Ys, teh asshat at the bitcoin Channel is promoting it on his page as he is invested.  I can make 150,000 a day mining with a reasonable rig and there will be 100 Billion minted.  If you want to invest go for it.  I think Cryptsy is just adding coins to cover up its sub par performance as of late.  I love Cryptsy, love it.  But enough of the ignorance Paul.

Join the gold rush.  10% user growth a day means money flowing in.  Get positioned for when the USD market opens and outside investors flood in.  This is not a solicitation to invest.  However, you should stop by to see what the charts look like.  It is a good time.

What?  Obvious, people trust mtgox more than the other exchanges if they are paying a premium to use their service.  How do you children not get that.  Tired of the nonsensical bs you guys talk.
Mtgox, charges the same commission on all transactions.  The market sets the price. Econ 101, supply and demand.

Looking at a business perspective, they are financing operation with pre-orders.  Without pre-order then have no miners to start with.  At that point they have a contractual obligation to deliver product.  
One must assume they are running on the network and earning btc to increase revenue, if they are not, they are stupid.  
So they should be having two forms of income, profit from sale of items, and the farming aspect of business.
Their expense are labour, r&amp;d, product components, and overhead of building and electricity.
So they are making a profit from the sale of the units, which they are plowing into R&amp;D for next gen.  Their mining operation is likely all profit.  Very cool profit. that is the best investment over next 4 years.
So cool.

That is really dumb idea.  Micropayments are a huge deal for bitcoin, but the whole car paying thing is just dumb.  It is pointless.  Either everyone is going fast, or you have people trying to extort, but that wouldn't pay.  it is just a dumb idea.  That guys needs to get a new micropayment example.

Watch me destroy your childish and uninformed thoughts:
1. Yes, until you realize that "virtual" is a fancy detract from the utility of Bitcoin.  Remittance, payments, notary, escrow, monetization of content on the internet, etc.   Then you realize, you have been a dope for falling for the virtual talk.  You do realize that non-virtual instrements are as abstract as Bitcoin.  Fraction reserve currency and signing your name to a mortgage an making payments for 30 years are nice examples.
2. still in beta, the credfit card industry took years to develop.  how fast do you think retailers will come on line when you cut their costs by 1.5%? Wal-mart built an empire on 1.5% reduction in cost to consumer.  You have a brian dretone, use it.  Oh my, dretone, your name is dretone, I now have a clearer imagine of you and thus your confusion on all things finance.  Gold chains are an okay investment, but bitcoin better.
3. Bitpay can be used to mitigate this and obviously there is potential for other players to help in this area.  Maybe you shoudl work on that, make some money.  Your music career is not going to pan so this would be wise.
4. true, lets compare apples and oranges.  Know your market and adjust your strategy accordingly.
5. still in beta and please do not try and compare now to teh future big man, you nor I know it.  If yf the application of bitcoin in integrated into your browser, instead of having to sign up for ESPN Insider for $15 a year or whatever it is, you could pay for teh article you want for a penny or so, that is a huge incentive to get some bitcoin.  It also helps out in monetizing your content online when ad revenue is dropping and advertising is getting more invasive to compensate.  You can figure that out?
6.  Correct, until you think about the utility that bitcoin offers that is not offered by fiat, see point 1
7. All a product of the scale.  Google iPOed at $80?  Doomed to fail since it is at $1000?  Perhaps, but  what is biggest threat to that business.  Bitcoin.  google is ads, bitcoin is pay per view.  Boom.  Your brain is getting bigger.
8. most things are not anonymous, how is that an issue.  The internet is not anonymous, the Feds are all over it.  Does that mean the internet is going away, yes....  I see... Was fun while it was not under the purview of the feds
9. Another business opportunity I would think.  Since you have the answers , g make some money.
10.  I thought this would be regulated by now but, I am starting to think that it would be wise to leave it un regulated.  It drive the cost down as compared to traditional banking and credit.  You have to deal with trusted parties when using Bitcoin and your reward, less expense.  Businesses could encapsulate that risk and take the premium, basically insurance.  Now you are thinking like a man, Dre.
11. *yawn* as adoptions continue to grow
12. ASICs greatly reduce and effieciencies likely to come out to address
13.  Good for you Dre.  You're a man now.
14.  Grow up, Dre. You have no influence on the global market.  This subreddit is tiny and .  What a child.   You've much to learn.
