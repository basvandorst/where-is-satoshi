Not to bite on the conspiracy, but maybe it would make sense when they see a lot of sells to restrict trading to prevent the price from dipping. They might lose revenue in the moment, but in the long run add price stability at a higher price level, so that they are taking fees from a higher price but with lower transaction volume.

Are you generalizing an entire subreddit from one comment that some random dude made?

By "economists want to kill bitcoin" he of course means, "I can think of some examples of economists saying they don't think bitcoin will replace usd, but maybe blockchain tech can contribute something useful."

Okay you're right, there should only ever be one source of information for any topic on the internet.
