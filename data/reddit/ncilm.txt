Are you trolling? .io is used for various things, I don't see any reason to automatically associate that with hacking.
but yeah idk if cex.io is known or legit, but I think I should look for another exchange that doesn't just take a ton of money and then completely ignore me when I ask them where it went.

You should be a lot more clear about that, like you could have sent a while ago a mail to your customers encouraging them not to make any deposits because you're overwhelmed, for example. Or a big warning on your website, or whatever. Currently, there's little to no communication.
The only way I found out about support being overwhelmed was reading over Reddit threads. And even then, it's hard to know who to believe.

This is insane. How can companies like that still exist.
We really need some proper regulations to avoid all those exchanges scamming people (or getting hacked).
I will personally consider that cex.io robbed me and spread the word everywhere I can until resolves my situation. Their reddit account keeps claiming that they've paid every payment since 2013 etc, but I only see threads of people that literally have to turn to courts, and even then they still don't get their money back apparently.
And shit some people might send a good chunk of their life savings there, it's disgusting that there's no way to just get our money back when it's blatantly stolen.

I already sent you a PM with this info yesterday actually

I found your thread by searching on Reddit. u/CEX_IO is also stealing my money apparently, as they ignore me. This is pretty scary.

The thing is that they initially were the ones to contact me asking for info about my payment. Then they started either not replying or sending weird copy pasted stuff that doesn't make sense, so it's getting pretty weird.

What? I’m replying to cex _io
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:28:20
yep. anyone can register anything. That's why I assumed it was a troll cause I don't see how it could mean anything.
It's actually pretty popular in tech startups nowadays, that and TLD hacking with puns.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:00:22
Well, u/CEX_IO seems to say that, but none of the posts I've seen have actually been updated with people actually getting their money, so...

I already know about that, but I wouldn't call it a red flag. Tons of companies use .io domains because it sounds techy, and in the case of cex.io most likely because they wanted a short name TLD but they're impossible to find in .com.
I mean,  I find .io domains a bit cringy, but I wouldn't automatically associate them with bad things.
(Also they're in Poland I believe, at least their bank is)
