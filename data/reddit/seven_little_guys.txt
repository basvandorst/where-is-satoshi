excatly. ALL I hear is 'oh, Core is a bunch of suits behind closed doors... yada yada lizard people...' Lots of FUD and hate from the bcash side of the crowd. 
Core didn't win. 
People who support real bitcoin (BTC) and who don't believe that a currency 'can be flipped' as it would make ALL digital currency's useless if one was 'ripped off' like BCH has been trying to do to real bitcoin (BTC). And it has been users that help fend that crap off.

Hate to say it but 'AltF' is correct; in fact - Bitcoin is one of the most traceable commodities there is, personally I consider that a strength of the currency that's not been realized yet. 
Every transaction from one account to another is tracked for ever on the blockchain. There is no secrecy in bitcoin. It's all there for anyone who wants to go over the history, forever. Every Transaction since the start of it all will always be recorded for everyone to see.
I also take offence at the propaganda of tying Bitcoin, a nice technology I'm interested in with 'bad industries' or 'bad actors'. To me, I don't use it for that, I think the tech is a cool investment. Why are you trying to put dirty propaganda b.s. in my cool technology?
And to 2nd 'AltF's note- if you want to get all high and mighty, go bitch about a coin that does provide anonymity like Monero. 
But really- If you pay taxis and that goes to build weapons and kill people (at least that's what the US does with our money here) but you have a problem with the morality of a digital currency? 
Exactly. Fuck off mate.
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:41:03
lol. dude. what do you think this is star wars? tool of the powerful? if you want power, maker yourself have it. Are you all in on the 'deep state' also? Let me tell ya something- there is no big conspiracy and everyone's out for themselves. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 23:10:26
So, sounds like you have little more than 2/3rd's of a bitcoin.   
Nice suprise on a rainy day!  
 HODL that and check back in 3 years or so, it will be worth 10x what it is now most likely.

meh. what did you expect? happens to anything that gets popular. Your grandma will be calling next asking about it and she'll get scammed. etc. etc.   
Go invest in a obscure but good 'shitcoin' if you want to get back to when its all research and learning.   :)

Not high enough for me to selll em when I know if I wait 2+ years I could sell them for A LOT more. I'm patient.

Do you mean you cashed out and didn't pay taxes on the gains? 
If so, I wouldn't feel guilty;  ....I would feel very very afraid.  \(unless it was under 5k.\)  
It's only a matter of time until the IRS comes looking for ~~your~~ their money.

Speak for yourself. I brought in at $70. and have been HODL ever since. You had best give me a sky high price before I decide to part with my digital children.

That was actually kinda cool.

To be honest- Nott a fan of this design. To complex and the 'S' looks off- not round enough or balanced. Too squiggly.

meh. Miner here and I can hold. Plenty like me are sitting pretty.  
 I have enough to pay electric bills and choose to hodl until the price is good.  
 Not every miner is living day to day, anyone who is good at this has plenty of cash on hand stacked up. Its called managing your money, same thing can be said for those fools who live paycheck to paycheck.   
People who are good at financing are not idiots.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:30:36
You mean only buy when it's high? That's smart. Yes, never invest in an asset that everyone else is panic selling. You'll never win that way! Lol. Always buy when it's popular and sell low!

Thought 21 million club was for those who had 21 Bitcoins or over? no? (I don't have anywhere close to 21 Bitcoin btw, just thought that's what it meant.)
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:55:19
honestly- I'd sell.   
Take the profit.   
Wait for the fall and buy back in at a lower price. This is not going to last imho.

Thats good. That will help reduce confusion. Especially for newcomers.

last night, normal transaction from coinbase took 20 min. standard fees. Not that bad.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:46:42
it is indeed. I own = parts bitcoin and bitcoin cash. 
Bitcoin cash now feels dirty. If it wins I don't even want it anymore. I mean, I will hold the money, but it is indeed what you said - 'anti-bitcoin'. A dirty take over by some chinese company, bitman. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:08:54

I am very upset at the people who are doing this bch fake pump to bitcoin. Its junk. 
As a LONG term bitcoin holder who has both I see BCH as dirty, shifty money. Blerg. If they don't stop they will really hurt the whole brand, both BCH and BTC will loose out. 
....What was that quote -  'United we stand, divided we fall'?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:22:19
Bitcoin is the main, active branch development branch. It has segwit (a way to make transactions cheaper) but not segwit 2x. (As that 2nd part was cancelled and never happend.)
The active Bitcoin branch also has a fix that levels out difficutly better as there was some bug with bitman machines that was giving china a bit of a edge up. (though, China is the major player regardless.)
The forks started happening about 6 months ago when some people figured out they could just 'copy the project' for example, BCH or "bitcoin cash" or "bcash" was the first real popular active fork, and that's when people started mining the dead end version of the software to create an alt coin.and call it "brandname bitcoin" - type of typical commodity. 
This way anyone who really brought in on bitcoin would get one which gives it a artificial leap frog in the marketplace.
The bummer is the real new ideas and technologies like Ethereum sits at around 400 while BCH shot up to crazy levels of over 1k just because everyone owned some so people started to 'pump it up'. But its not like a good alt coin or blockchain technology upgrade. Its a clone.
Even though, BCH has no real use value over BTC compared to other currencies, it is not supported at all by any merchants yet, and you can't really use it for much.
IMHO, it really sucks. A - it diminishes the entire deflationary currency thing. What good is 21 mil cap if anyone is 2x 'ing it? Now we have 21 bitcoin and 21 bcash. Blerg. That really sounds messy, confusing and diminishes overall brand name.
There is lots of debate about which coin should have more sway or which is better technology wise.
Also, some people behind BCH kinda pulled some weird stuff, here is a good rundown for example:
Also- you can see BTC (bitcoin) BCH (bitoin-cash or bcash) BTG (bitcoin-gold) &amp; Ethereum (ETH) can all be found here:
If your going to move to a ledger, might as well split them out. I did with the cash ones but haven't bothered with the gold as it feels like such shady coin. But, money is money, could at least convert it back into real BTC after.
As far as the ledger, use r/ledger or whatever. Its a good device but it is finicky on how things are launched, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:31:36
So your like into this kinda stuff?
that's the kind of person I would expect would be supporting bch.

10 k is easy, but saving a bitcoin isn't.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:45:40
wat? go back to 2013. This crash was way too short, and not nearly as devastating as it needed to be.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:29:22
I agree! this helps avoid confusion, especially with noObs and old people coming into the field. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:28:13
the amount you transfer is not tied to the fee, that's part of the problem people are hitting right now. If you want to move $3 bucks the fees are too much. If you want to move $300 not so much.
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:34:56
JUST WRITE YOUR BLOODY KEYS DOWN. and keep them in a safe place. Then you don't have to rely on software. If the software didn't give you keys -( 12 or 24 words ) then you DONT own it.
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:37:37
Next halving is not until mid-2020. 
Looking at past history, its at least 6 months to 1 year for a bull run after a halving.
I'd call bear market until 2021 and a low price of 1,500.00 so I'd hold off for a bit.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:16:48
You obviously don't know much about tech. 
Software takes a long time to get to the point where its ease of use makes it accessible enough to be adopted by the masses. My example is early internet things like telnet and gopher being about the level of crude tech that btc is currently. I.E. the start of the internet is indeed similar and took a long time just like adoption of blockchain tech will take.
But, you seem pretty clueless so whatever dude. Good luck to ya.  :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:39:21
That is awesome and thank you so much for putting links there.
That last one that's still on Reddit; 
I'm worried that will soon be removed as well. 
Anyone know a good web crawler downloading app that one could download a copy of that bible and all its links before its removed from public servers?
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:19:17
Yea but one has to get in some time. (got in around 2011 and buying ever since.)
Dollar cost averaging is the best way to do it safely. 
Also, anything around or below 8.5k is a great buy also IMHO.
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:47:39
Correct. This is a liquidity problem. 
Kind of like penny stocks. Not enough players yet. 
Back when it was $30 makes today look rock solid and very slow. I remember the fall from $70 and it happened in seconds.  Now the ups and downs are much slower comparatively. 
In time, as it grows it will become more and more stable. 
But for now, yes, it swings too much to be useful as a currency. 
My work around is to buy it right before I spend it. That way its always close to dollar value.
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:30:59
meh, hasn't really damaged the community. Bcash is bla bla bla bla bla. what er dude; enjoy your bcash and be happy.
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:34:50
There is literally no difference between bcash and bitcoin as far as it being a pain in the ass for merchants. Sure, if traffic is really high, the fee might be smaller for bcash, but that's it.
 
This thread is not about how Reddit is using bcash is it? Why not stay on topic.
Oh- and what the heck is 'bitcoin core'? It's called 'bitcoin'.
Only Ver uses that submersive term. 
Are you a Roger Ver fan boy?
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:23:59
yep. it's ALL going to collapse. Any minute now...
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:01:31
agreed. especially when other places have had segwit for ages. I don't understand why it took them so long. I don't like coinbase anymore honestly, seems a bit shady ignoring Seqwit for months now like that. 
Glad they FINALLY have added it but come on.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:05:05
ya know... the internet was at least 20 years old in 1992 if not older than that.
You sound like one of those people in the 90's talking about "that crazy email fad that the kids are using".
If you really want to know about some of the foundation you can listen to the man himself regarding the parallels to the internet and the importance of not having trust/rely in companies or government.
But in short, BTC has not gone anywhere but up since 2009. 
What makes you think its going to all of a sudden change now?
(A.Antonop talking) 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:04:17
You just don't get it. Companies making their own blockchains is indeed stupid. The blockchain is only useful because it is trustless and not owned by any company, kinda like the internet. 
A centralized or controlled blockchain by a company is dumb, you might as well just use a spreadsheet.
 Anyway- Im done wasting my time on you. Sorry your so salty you missed out. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:11:03
'segwit' is just a code adjustment in the way it packs the transfers into the blocks that get processed. It does it in a more efficient manner so you can get more transfers in a 1 mb block. 
Many wallets have had that code change for a while now, like Ledger for example. Its not rocket science in This case.
The code adjustment that implemented seqwit happened last August (and the dead branch that didn't update the code change became the fork known as BCH) 
As some say (though I think this is debated) The segwit adjustment also inadvertently fixed a bug that was being taken advantage of by the Bitmain company.  The bug that was fixed and nixed Bitmains advantage mine at a 20% or so advantage than others with their hardware.
And Batching, as I understand it; is simply the practice of a company bundling up a lot of transactions and doing it as 1 blockchain transaction at 1 time. 
Nicehash does this for example once per day where it transfers all its payments out in 1 blockchain transaction. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:40:41
It hasn't been $50 bucks in ages dude. Only if your an idiot are you paying that kind of fee. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 22:53:16
Yes its good. The reward being cut in half increases 'Scarcity' which tends to make it more valuable.

Use a credit union and screw the big banks. I use a local credit union for all my banking.
 They have no problem with coinbase, treat me much better than any national bank ever has and have better rates. 
Plus I'm supporting the local community. Will never go back to any big bank.

Think you've maybe been hanging in in some bad subreddits too much maybe? It's not really been that dramatic. 
There was one hard fork last Aug. that after it happened; some people turned it into a lot of drama.

Use the 'Feedback' button under the label to the right. Copy paste this or write you're  own:  
" Bitcoin is not 'Cash'. Bitcoin or BTC is a 'Currency'. This should be 'Currency' not 'Cash'. By putting 'Cash' under the word 'Bitcoin' Google is knowingly or unknowingly pushing a questionable currency called 'Bitcoin-cash' or BCH. Many believe this to be a 'scam' cryptocurrency. All cryptos used to hold and transfer value should be noted as a 'Currency'. Including Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc.  "  
Please, take a second and do this. This is google so it DOES matter what it says.

Actually, Tonys original call for the bottom was around 3,400. He kept listening to Tyler and eventually started agreeing with it the lower $1,500. But, in hindsight, his original call was right on target.
