Once you have BTC, you can pay for certain things mostly online but some IRL too (a resturant in Berlin, for example).
You can also sell BTC to people via classifieds. You would then arrange a meetup with someone, they will give you $$$ or whatever you chose and in return you will send him/her so many BTC.
Alternatively, you can use an exchange. It's a bit like classifieds except you don't meet IRL and the exchange takes a cut for escrowing the funds and arranging the transaction. Then you can wire your $$$ in a bank account.
Or you can arrange to buy something off an individual for BTC.
I hope this clarifies

If I go to a specific bank (a couple of branches ONLY in my city), then I have very reduced fees on cash withdrawal because of a partnership between my EU bank and this bank. Visa handles the conversion and their rates are much better than the banks'.
The point is, it still costs something and is utterly inconvenient for that price. I have to travel 25 min on public transit, go to this bank, withdraw my cash, walk a few blocks, go to my own bank and deposit the cash there. Then travel all the way back to where I live. Rinse and repeat every month.
I thought about bitcoins because I am very interested in the system and I was curious to see if it could work for that. But I think it's too experimental for now and I won't use it for any critical business. Getting my monthly income is definitely critical so no BTC (yet).
When the system is more mature, convenient, cheaper and most of all less volatile (rate-wise) I might consider it as an alternative.
But for now I will only use it with a low amount to experience with it rather than trusting it with all of my money.

There is, but it comes with gouging fees and a ridiculous exchange rate.

Gouging fees, ridiculous exchange rates

There are no such things in my country of origin. 
Besides, the govt doesn't own banks, banks own the govt. FIFY

There is the obvious anonymity factor to consider as well.
It seem the greedy majors are attempting another run for it (at least in Canada) to try and racket people who might have downloaded some of their movies on BitTorrent with their IP seeding as the only “hard” evidence.
One way to mitigate this risk is to use a VPN. But what good is a VPN if it is linked to your CC/Paypal account? Then instead of going to your ISP, they will go to your VPN and request your details be disclosed.
Now, if you are paying for your VPN from a specially created address with bitcoins that you acquired with cash either from an exchange or from someone in person, then the VPN provider cannot know who you are and thus has nothing to disclose to the company requesting the records.
Same goes for countries censoring internet content (oh hi China and friends), it is very hard to subscribe to a VPN without arising suspicion using your bank account. With bitcoins, the bank will never know and thus never report that one individual sent money to a VPN service.
That's the use I see in bitcoins that might influence its use in the near future as attacks on internet communications privacy intensify.

Nice to hear! Where do you sell? Do you have your own website? How do you handle the BTC rate fluctuations? I guess you have to cash your BTC to some “accepted” currency to pay your suppliers, right?

You do realise this is the central bank of Canada, right? Individuals can't open accounts in a central bank 
@_date: 2012-12-17 23:58:45
I didn't know they provided such a service, looking into it now
@_date: 2012-12-16 22:46:39
Ha, curious to try this...
@_date: 2012-12-17 17:57:21
Hmm, it seems the risk is not worth it compared to how much money it would save.
While I'd much rather give fees to the bitcoin community than the banks, There is quite a risk in using BTC for now. Maybe it will be viable in the future, but for now I will probably stick to my old ATM routine.
Thanks for your answers, and I'll definitely try bitcoins with a lower amount

Using Paypal as a bank is a huge mistake.
Or rather
Using Paypal is a huge mistake.

Thought about this, but banning *.imgur.com will break a lot of legit pictures reddit-wide

Just let us know when you're buying and when you're selling
@_date: 2013-02-09 17:04:45
I see, thanks!
@_date: 2013-02-10 05:47:05
Thanks for all your answers! I understand it's more advisable to invest 150$ in BTC when the bubble pops in a few weeks.

Thanks, very useful. Can I ask who is your SMS provider/gateway? I shopped around for my Asterisk server and it was all outrageously expensive (0.10+$/SMS). 
What us your backend? Asterisk or something else? I'm curious to know more

While I would love to pay in BTC rather than growing Vias, MasterCrard and Paypal's businesses, I wouldn't want to pay with BTC on eBay.
The quality is so low on there that the buyer needs a sure way of getting his money back if the item never arrives/is defective/not as advertised and the seller never answers.
I don't know your particular store, this is a general comment on buying on eBay.
TL;DR No I wouldn't because of Paypal's and CC's ability to chargeback if anything goes wrong
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:31:35
It has been signed for with proof of delivery and there is a tracking number. How can Paypal reverse the payment?

For some of us they are boring, annoying and cluttering space. To each their own I guess.
By putting memes on a dedicated subreddit, those who want to see them will still see them and those who don't won't. It's a win-win

Not true, they get processed as fast, sometimes faster.
There was a graph I saw supporting that but of course I can't find it anymore.

I asked a similar question not too long ago and the consensus was that buying the ASIC's price worth of BTC is probably a better investment because if you order now the ASICs will ship in a few months and by then the difficulty will probably have gone much higher making you unable to recoup.
