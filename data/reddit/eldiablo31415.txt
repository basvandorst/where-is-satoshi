It's P2P lending can and does connect people that have money with people that need money but it does transfer a substantial amount of risk to the lender. Most people simply do not have enough time nor the financial sophistication to constantly manage who they are lending money to. Moreover relying on a bank instead of P2P lending insures provides liquidity as well as a small return. Bitcoin could take over the world and the demand for banking would not change much.

I don't think its accurate to say that the time and place for banks has passed. Banks fundamentally serve the purpose of connecting people that have money but do not currently need to spend it, with people that do not have money but have a need to make a purchase.  Currently I don't see this need to connect savers and spending going away anytime soon and consequently banks are likely here to stay.

Banks don't create labor but they do create value.

I would love it if you could give me an example of a profitable company that paid zero in taxes that wasn't a result of a carry over from a prior year loss.

How will Bitcoin make an investment bank irrelevant? Are companies going to stop going public? Will companies no longer issue stock? These are all things that will need to continue to happen in the event of full adoption.

Make sure to remember to claim that on your taxes as income. Also make sure to record the tax basis in that bitcoin so that if buy anything with it you can properly report your gain to the IRS :)

I can't speak for the whole buttcoin community, but I am personally there because of the fat checks from the big banks.

I'm confused how could a public ledger help us keep track of banks accountants and lawyers? Banks already have to disclose publicly where their cash comes from and a lot of business transactions are more complicated than simple cash transactions so would it really help us keep track of anything a bank did?

Banks (and every publicly traded company for that matter)  are  required to hire outside accountants look at their records and make sure that they aren't just making stuff up. Are you suggesting that audits by accountants would no longer be necessary and could effectively be crowed sourced if banks adopted bitcoin?

Because it can be used to buy government debt which guarantees a market for the currency.

Banks DO lend out deposits. Think of how banks worked before computers. If 1000 people all deposited $100  in cash into their savings accounts the banks didn't put the money into 1,000 safety deposit boxes.  As far as the bank was concerned they just had one big pile of money. They would lend out $90,000  into the community and keep the other $10,000 in a big "pile" in their vault. Then if any of the original 1,000 depositors wanted to withdraw their money the bank just gets the money from the $10,000 that they have in reserve.

Judging from your response to I think you have a misunderstanding of how reserve requirements work.  As part of US Federal Regulations banks with over 110.2 million in assets must hold 10% of deposits. 
In other words banks can only lend out an amount that is equal to 90% of their deposits. 
 If banks could lend out 900 dollars for every 100 that they held in deposits just by "creating new money" bank runs would never happen because they could just pay the people seeking a withdrawal with  the deposits they "dont lend out."  Bank runs happen percisely because most of the money that people have deposited has been lent out.
