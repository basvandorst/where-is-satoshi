Your payroll tax estimate seems a bit high.  And capital gains tax would only apply if the btc has appreciated.  And you forgot to mention you can deduct expenses to mine the btc.  Also, no one is going to report these taxes anyway, except those guys who bought Lamborghinis.

Partially correct. That limit is the maximum you can deduct over and above any capital gains you're claiming. If he never invests in a capital asset, you'd be right, $3k per year. But if he made another million in gains, he'd be able to use the entire amount of the loss carryover.

Almost sounds like a Verbal Kint/Keyser Söze type story.  I wonder if Kevin Spacey could pull off playing an Asian man for the movie.

To whom are you expecting to owe taxes?  What taxes are you expecting to pay? Capital gains?  If we don't pay taxes on fluctuation in the value of the dollar, why would we pay taxes on changes in the value of BTC?  It's not a dollar denominated financial instrument and it's not regulated in the US.

It works either way. Anytime you're talking about giving fucks, you don't care, whether or not you could or couldn't give said fuck.
Source: I don't give a fuck.

Except he actually sent it to the guy to whom he offered it, Frozensorrow the Deathknight.

Although, the US allows a tax credit for the amount of foreign taxes you have to pay.  So in countries where the tax rate is higher than in the US, no additional taxes would be due.  In lower tax jurisdictions, Americans would have to pay the difference between the lower foreign tax rate and the higher US tax rate.

Which means what exactly?  If they treat it as a currency, it would be a foreign currency and you'd have to pay taxes just the same, that is, unless the value was pegged to the dollar.  If the value of btc changes from the time you acquired it, it's a tax event with foreign currencies.

Because I don't agree with you and your logic is infallible?  Are you saying that there is no way you're wrong?

Except he sent it to himself and it's too much work to social engineer five people by yourself.

No need to resort to personal attacks, we can just agree to disagree.  I simply don't believe everything I read in the internet.

At first, the idea of a saving society may sound great, but what will everyone do for work?  How could massive deflation lead to anything other than massive unemployment? Entire industries would be crippled, leading to layoffs, then with little income, no one would be able to buy anything even if they needed it. It just wouldn't work in practice. I think we consume too much, but the other extreme is worse.

Unfortunately, there isn't any politicians that run on that particular issue. We have a Rent is to damn high party, but no Use whatever software you wish party.  As for this particular issue, I never said it was a bad idea, I'm just being realistic, if you want change, using our wallets as votes works a whole lot faster than the government.

He really didn't have to send anything, he could have let the thread die. Look, when anonymity is a key component of Bitcoin, you have to approach these situations with a fair bit of skepticism. Just because he made an open offer to the first person to post an address, doesn't mean he couldn't have sent it to himself.  
If you had 0.8 BTC to randomly send to someone, would you rather send it to an unknown person or to yourself, especially given the fact they accomplish the same goal and it's completely anonymous?  Because anyone could recreate that same thread in any forum.

The point he was making was people would suffer because they may lose the government services and benefits paid for by taxes or that the tax base would unfairly fall on those only involved in the related market, not because they simply aren't paying taxes. Honestly, the point about taxes is a valid one.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:05:06
How is that relevant now?  It didn't go down that way.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:59:51
Taxes are due in the US.  Not sure anyone's getting audited over bitcoin just yet though.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:16:09
Weren't you talking about federal taxation?  We're in the same area if these IRS rulings apply to you.  
Edit: the sales tax would differ, the rest wouldn't.

It's a capital loss.  If you want to lock in profits, you'd just sell your btc immediately.

Why do I have to explain your motivation? I just simply stated my opinion and that doesn't affect you in any way.  Either you did it or not, you know the truth. Be satisfied with that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:24:25
Against your ordinary income, yes.  Against other capital gains, now or in the future, there is no limit.
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:13:37
Pay your taxes?  The fact that the US government accepts dollars as payment for taxes gives it its value. People need dollars to satisfy their debts with the state.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:32:03
You are confused, stocks, and the other assets he mentioned are not part of the money supply.  The only exception would be if by debt he meant T-bills.

There will always be a bid/ask spread.  There is no unless.  When you sell at the buyer's price, you're hitting their bid. If they take your price, that's your ask price.

The way you wrote that it sounds like you mean that a vendor would collect the capital gains tax in addition to the sales tax, which certainly is not the case. You'll never actually be charged any capital gains tax, those taxes would have to be self reported at the present moment, since the IRS wouldn't have any record of these transactions. Unless, of course, Coinbase starts issuing tax documents with each sale and purchase.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:14:18
You pay taxes on Adjusted Gross Income, not gross income, and adjusted means net of expenses.  You certainly can deduct your expenses to mine bitcoin.

Why have the government create more laws?  You're asking for more regulation?  Vote with your wallet, if you don't like Apple's policies don't buy their products. No laws needed.
