This is turning into the silver market. This is fucking boring. And yeah, I don't see how this doesn't leade to crypto as we know it being gone. Not bitcoin being dead, but it having turned into every other asset class ever.

Sure but it will also substantially hinder growth. Arguably forever. Crypto is turning into the fucking precious metals markets.

Paypals one of the most crooked services on the planet. You have zero control of your money with paypal. Just because people are used to getting fucked in the ass by our financial infrastructure doesn't mean it shouldn't change. Paypal doesnt work fine, at all. They hold your cash whenever they feel like it to earn interest on it.
That said, bitcoin could absolutely fail, but you didn't list a single legitimate reason for that. And you didn't even mention the sole property of crypto that makes it valuable.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:21:39
Yea, they don't need any money from us to buy bitcoin.  They print whatever they want. If they wanted to do what you're describing they would just do it and bitcoin would be 500,000 a coin

The Scientific community has done many studies on mob mentality and the madness of crowds. Assets generally fall 5 times faster than they go up because the emotional impulse that causes people to sell, fear, is estimated to be 5 times stronger than than greed, which makes you buy. I suggest reading Trade for a living, The madness of Crowds, and....cant think of the other one right now.

If you ever thought you weren't gambling then you were mislead or didn't do your research. Yes blackjack is way more fun than crypto. But it doesn't last as long.  Bitcoin could hit an all time high today. Or it could go to 10$ and never recover. But that's been true for almost a decade. It was always the case. There was never any magic. It's all bullsht until people use it. Are you just angry you didn't take profits? Don't let it get you down amigo. Buy real estate instead. It's the only thing they aren't making more of. Crypto is created out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:10:42
Ill send you a pizza if youre right. Unfortunately I feel like this might be where I get off the crypto train. Not because I think its dying, I don't think it will ever die. But if this is how the market responds every month now, forever, Id rather take my profits and buy more land. This shit is boring.

Look at it this way: You now have an emotional stake in Bitcoin, which means you are now on a roller coaster for as long as you want to stay on it. The ride alone is worth the money, and I honestly mean that. You'll probably also make some money.

@_date: 2017-08-09 19:10:20
Yeah so I guess what I'm wondering about right now is what makes you an exchange. If i sell my coins on polo or coinbase, I'm technically reselling them, so why is it any more legal?
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:17:11
I was thinking 40 - 50 but yeah, 50 might be high considering how few people I know have even heard of it, much less researched it. And I didn't realize the Cambridge estimate was so high. I will have to re-read it.

This is my point:
You insenuated he would be taking a real risk in transferring his money trough traditional means rather than bitcoin. Further, you insenuated those risks aren't present in bitcoin transactions. That isn't true at all and it's cultish to imply it. We shouldn't be trying to convince new users that crypto is better and safer than fiat when it isn't yet. We think it will be. I sure hope will be. But it isn't yet. Is that fair?
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:27:45
It's a huge barrier to people caring about bitcoin.  It's a total pain in the ass to use but nobody wants to talk about it.

@_date: 2017-08-11 00:37:04
Sure but that happens in crypto as much if not more. Every hour there's a new post somewhere about people losing shit loads of crypto for dozens of reasons.  Exchanges freezing, nefarious acts, exchanges shutting down completely, transaction taking days and weeks, etc. bitcoin is not more efficient than banks right now, but bitcoin is harder to use. That's a fact and it's a huge problem for crypto nobody seems to be addressing. 
EDIT: for most people (99.9% of the world ) their money is safer in a bank than in crypto. You can't even keep crypto on an exchang because of how clown shoes this fucking space is. Does that not say anything about the state of things here? there isn't a single safe exchange. We have a very very long way to go.

Yeah, the dudes with the capital to effectively short btc are now in the market.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:59:00
Because there was too much money to be made in a short amount of time. Contrary to what redditors talk about and say, the people who control the market want more money. Period. You can't have an asset of any type just keep going up without correcting. 99% of people who own crypto just want more money and could give a rat's ass about "the tech" (which you still cant use to do anything in everyday life). But we'll get there.

Bitcoin is 100% speculative. Speculative doesn't mean it won't prevail. It just means it's value is based on speculation. It's great to believe in the technology, I know I do. But you have to understand this is all still speculation. Bitcoin could be worth 100k in the future. It could also be worth 0 because every superpower on earth made it illegal to buy and sell it. 
EDIT: and what's going on in China isn't good news for crypto as so many people here would try to have you believe. If China successfully illegalizes crypto, it sets a very very bad precedent for all of us.

Traders are largely responsible for price action. Traders help make markets. Bitcoin benefits from traders, and true traders make far more money than holders. 
Bitcoin would have never hit 5 k without traders.
That's the one thing about this sub that has really brought it home for me how inexperienced most of the people here are: they think traders are bad. Traders are a part of any market and they bring liquidity.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:48:14
Your post is bullshit. 
First of all, Charlie Lee doesn't own Bitcoin or Litecoin. Nobody has any equity stake in them. He owns some currency. 
Secondly, telling people something you know about legislation in another country isn't illegal anyway.
Third, he has already told the public he is long Bitcoin and Litecoin. So even if this were a stock (which it isn't) and he were an insider (whish he isnt because Litecoin isn't owned by anyone), he still would have done nothing illegal.
You're just mad you're losing money and you are trying to blame someone for your own stupid decisions.

That doesn't seem possible at the moment because crypto supporters seem to have a problem admitting this is still 100% speculation. I own crypto and believe in it, but I also know these prices are completely imaginary hype driven numbers based on greed and speculation, and nothing else. That's not an opinion either, it's a fact. You can't actually do anything with crypto right now except hope it goes up in value. Once supporters of crypto will acknowledge that publicly I think there will be progress. Right now it's more of a cult than a currency. Nobody would be buying if they couldn't make money doing it. But nobody wants to talk about that. They want to talk about how this will change the world yada yada yada.

In stocks if you do more than 4 round trips on a stock in 1 business week, you're considered a "pattern Day trader" and you must have 25000 in your trading account or you will be shut down as per the sec.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:56:50
No, because you can't buy anything with it.

@_date: 2017-09-14 04:40:43
Nobody knows. That's the long and short of it. Buy if you want, wait if you want. Nobody can call the bottom or the future. I've been right about every prediction I've made in this market. You can check my post history, and my opinion is it will hit around 3200. But it also might not. I'll put it this way, if it went to 2000 in the next hour or went to 6099 by tommorrow, I would not be surprised, even remotely, either way.  
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:39:28
"Guaranteed to increase" lololol yeah man bitcoin is all fundamentals huh? This subreddit is full of shit these days.

@_date: 2017-09-10 17:24:06
A ton of people accurately call the bottom every time this happens. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:42:29
Just my opinion: I would wait awhile if I were you. We're probably going to go lower once China proves to the world that bitcoin can in fact be completely stopped by a government in a matter of days.
Then it will probably resume it's upward trend.
But hey it could also hit 6k tonight.

Based on all the other posts and what I experienced at coinbase a month ago, they aren't able to keep up with new users. Just wait it out they'll get it fixed. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:21:20
Nah it was worthless back then. Coulda woulda shoulda but I didn't. If I recall my friend and I who had farmed the items looked at the address they were held in like 1 time, and then immediately forgot about it. Never saw it again. Nobody knew back then so I don't really look at it as a loss. I remember what we sold though. It was a bunch of duped occulus stone of jordan rings. They guy said he only had bitcoin, we didn't even know what it was but we had many accounts full of these rings we had acquired so we said fuck it. 
The only thing that bothers me about it is my friend fell on extremely hard times and could really REALLY use the money. But hey, that's life. Everyday there's a new opportunity to make money. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:59:05
I think so as well. I went all fiat at 2800. I feel like august 1st might be quite a shake up( even if it's not warranted )

I've tried telling them what you're saying. You're wasting your breath amigo. Most people here don't understand that the powers that be literally have infinite money and there are literally hundreds of institutions and individuals who could destroy bitcoin overnight if they felt like it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:11:40
No don't be worried. Everything is slowed to a snails pace right now because crypto is spittin mad fire
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:08:49
This is why I use coinbase. They don't have to worry about this kind of stuff because they are on the same team as the people serving these warrants.

@_date: 2017-07-30 06:59:00
Not dumb. Just don't care all that much and are lazy. Poor people aren't buying bitcoin. People with money they don't care about are for the most part. 
I will never keep my own wallet because I don't give a shit. I want to hit buttons on my phone. I could care less about keys and as long as keys and nerdy bullshit wallets are required to be truly secure,bitcoin will never be mainstream.
I'm a software developer and even I have no desire to maintain wallets and keep track of that bullshit. I let coinbase do it for me because I have other shit to do.

It is definately mania. But it doesn't seem to matter because it's a self re-Inflating bubble apparently.  I mean you guys have been through three of these pops, including one two weeks ago, and where's the price today? Bitcoin too stronk, it comes back from anything. 
Edit: I say you guys because I'm new here. I think it's been a series of bubbles and will continue to be.

Just my two cents take it for what it's worth: bitcoin is overvalued at the moment and will dip significantly in the next 4 days. I sold at 2800. Will buy back later. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:35:22

Always try to remember reddit is an extremely efficient echo chamber. It's easy for us to get mixed up in sentiment here(not just in crypto, but in anything) that isn't the real-world truth. Echo chambers like reddit are how Trump beat Hillary.

It's been estimated at nearly 30%, but there's no telling. I can tell you I personally have lost access to around 9000 I was given in college in exchange for Diablo 2 items.
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:54:02
I sold at 2800. Bought back in at 2400ish. Sold again at 2800. Not buying again until I see a tank.  I think we'll see 2000 again very soon. Haven't been wrong about anything yet. You can check my post history. But I can promise you this: I'm  gunna be really wrong really soon, statistically speaking.

@_date: 2017-06-29 16:50:12
I had a few thousand back in the very early days someone gave me for items in Diablo 2. A best friend and I owned them together. We don't know where they are and will never recover them so we're both buying them now. It happens. Everything is relative. They weren't worth much back then so it's not like you did something stupid.

@_date: 2017-06-29 07:11:02
Nothing. Buy it. Keep it on coinbase. If you're a regular flawed human like anyone else on the planet you're probably more likely to lose your own bitcoin than coinbase is if we're realistic about it. There's as many stories of people losing / losing access to cold wallets as their are coinbase horror stories.

I'd buy a small amount now. But Technicals are pointing to BTC tanking pretty hard pretty soon. Just my 2 cents. 
What you're seeing now could be what's called a bull trap, which is typical during a mania, shortly after a financial instrument has peaked in near term value. It makes it look like things are ok again, but if you look at this on a monthly chart, it seems to be in an extremely healthy, established trend to a death drop. What comes after this (IF that's what's happening) is a very abrupt drop down 30-50%.
But it could also go to 3000 again in a matter of hours. Just my 2 cents. Do your own thang baby. Dem buttery biscuits is delicious looking at any price. almost too good to be true!
FD: I am long BTC and Ford Motor Co
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:23:53
That's the thing, everyone is kicking themselves you are right. 99% of the original holders of bitcoin sold when it hit an actual dollar amount. very few people held through this gain.

I think you're misunderstanding me, I'm agreeing with you lolol.
The Art of Trading talks about exactly what you just described. Your way of viewing lost money is 100% accurate.
By "That way of thinking" I was refferring to "you don't lose anything until you sell"
EDIT: And seriously, read The Art of Trading. It's a really good read and discusses manias and psychology and emotion. It's a great book for anyone, not just traders.

@_date: 2017-06-22 04:33:44
You can't actually be sure of that. And fwiw billions of new cryptocurrencies are in fact being created every month.
Edit: to elaborate, imagine if ethereum and all the other cryptos didn't exist. What would bitcoins market cap be? As long as anyone anywhere can do an ico, there is an unlimited supply of cryptocurrency and as long as people buy it, it directly takes away from the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:30:23
IMO Coinbase won't go away they will only get stronger. They make tons of money and they make buying and selling crypto really easy for people like me. I'm going to pay taxes on it either way, and I don't care if they have my info. And they are insured AND they reimbursed losses during their ETH flash crash. I love them. I can be in a deer blind half drunk and click my phone twice and instantly convert my crypto into USD.

Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:50:17
Yeah it's an odd beast. One one hand it behaves like any other publicly traded commodity....until it doesn't. Could be worth $10,000 in a week, could be worth $10. I'm just doing it for fun. My real money goes towards real estate. I do think it has a bright future, but I also think it's going much much lower before it explodes again.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:12:19
So this fork happens on August 1st?
As in, that's when you will have two copies of your coins ?
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:43:11
That's not really the only thing bitcoin doesn't have. Bitcoin is too volatile to be adopted for everything. One could argue the volatility stems from the lack of regulation. I love bitcoin, but I'm not accepting rent checks from tenants in bitcoin because I have no clue what that payment will be worth in 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:44:23
Not a noob question at all. My answer is find friends/partners. For example in Houston, you can find empty lots pretty damn close to downtown for 10,000. if youve got 1000$, save 1500 more, get 4 friends and buy it. Land is the only thing they aren't making more of.
In worse neighborhoods you can find lots for 3, 4 k sometimes.

It seems really really sketchy but it's just the way it is. I get what I call a "stripclub vibe" from most of these places. But Coinbase is in the US, and a lot of people use them. And they're VP is not a shady character, he goes on financial segments on various networks and talks about crypto in the news, etc.

True dat, what's odd is they never go down for me. My transaction will sometimes say pending for a bit during big swings, but i can always lock in price.
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:58:24
Yes, if you truly think it's possible, in my opinion, I bet you've already made decisions that will lead you to lose a lot of money very soon. And you probably won't second guess those decisions until it's too late. Just my opinion though :) I've been wrong before!
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:24:48
I'm extremely new, but I had the same problem as you. I finally was able to do it at Coinbase for what it's worth. But I had to try several credit cards before it would work.
It seems a lot of people don't like coinbase, but it's my only option until my Gemini/Kraken accounts finish pending.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:00:57
EDIT: I'm considering just meeting up with some rando and doing it cash, but it just seems weird.

I just realized my comment came off as shittier than I planned. What I meant was:
Banks in places like Walmart are there because people use them. If there were no market/demographic that needed it, it wouldn't exist.

Mostly done through realtors who have access to unlisted stuff/forclosures etc.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:03:22
lol, why exactly? with the exception of a few places, the vast majority of these exchanges seem shady as fuck. I get a strip club vibe from a lot of them.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:53:29
absolutely. I think bitcoin is the best investment there is for longterm. But I also think a lot of people who just bought in are about to lose not only their shirts (they already lost those) but their pants and their hula hoops too.

Man that made me laugh really hard

Oh man. This made me actually lol really good. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:53:18
I agree with you 100% 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:33:16
Because it's a pump and dump that broke securities laws in most of the countries they offered the ICO to.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:27:49
Can anyone tell me what the price will be in August?
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:36:21
So here's where my opinion comes from. And again, just my opinion (obviously).
The main thing that makes me question your perception of value is that you mentioned the ICOs as if they were a good thing. They are mostly garbage. Pyramid schemes. Pump and Dumps. Could a few of  them be a valuable business someday? Absolutely. And I believe a lot of them genuinely want to make something good. But take Ethereum for example. Do you know the history of Ethereum? What can you do with Ethereum besides give your money away to people for yet more coins? Nothing. Ethereum's only use is to give your money away in return for more cryptocurrency that in most cases doesn't even exist yet. Let that sink in for a minute.
I agree with some of your sentiment: I believe cryptocurrency can and will be somewhat disruptive to banks(it already is in my opinion) And I believe Bitcoin is as good a bet as any other commodity on earth. I'm extremely bullish on Bitcoin longterm.
But I also believe this is a gigantic bubble and people have lost touch with reality. Most of the average joe's speculating in crypto, I believe, will lose a lot of money they can't afford to because they have never traded anything ever and they cannot identify when something is overvalued.
Again this is all just my opinion. I could be 100% wrong. 
What I think will happen: Cryptocurrency will mature, and become a part of our daily lives, the masses. Banks and Cryptos and Currencies will all live together and it will be fine. 
I LOVE bitcoin/crypto and see a bright future ahead for it. But banks will always exist. 
I don't bury my silver in my backyard because I'd rather someone else protect it. Cryptocurrency is currency. Why would anyone think that nobody will want an easy way to protect their cryptocurrency? where did you buy your cryptocurrency? Probably from what is essentially a cryptocurrency bank. (if you accept deposits and loan currency, you're a bank) 
Sorry for such a long post!
EDIT: Yes your postal service analogy is right on par with what I'm trying to say. Hope I made sense.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:06:17
Wouldn't take a very large position(for people at that level) at all to destroy the price is what I'm saying. And the fear sells that come from those moves are what keep it down while a big short is covered.
All he(or whoever, hes just an instance I'm using) has to do is trigger it.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:29:06
DONT BE PLEASED BE SCARED OMG SKY IS FALLING SNAPCHAT BUGS BUNNY KAFTA KEBAB. Just kidding. Over time 2185 is probably a damn good price.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:44:15
Silly Boy is in fact my middle name in my crypto circle (which now consists of me, and you if you're in).
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:55:33
Yeah maybe so. I don't even own any yet, but I daytraded for years and I'm really enjoying just watching the cryptos to see how they behave, and looking for an in. Maybe Ill get one, maybe ill get left behind. Who knows...but man...the volatility in cryptos is sexy as fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:27:17
Man you're salty. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:32:28
Gentlemen's bet it goes below 2000.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:17:22
Nah he's broke. So broke he and his wife are in trouble.

Banks will make crypto better. Neil Degrasse Tyson sux. Cats are awful. I hate video games.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:06:17
I'm with you. If you were omnipotent and could find a way to do the real math involved, an individual is probably more likely to lose their bitcoin than coinbase is. Just use them. I love them. And they are insured. I don't want to mess with some stupid ass physical cryptowallet you god damned nerds.
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:58:25
I've opened exchange accounts all over the place. They are all stuck in eternal pending it would seem. Not sure about coinbase, Ive verified everything with them and i place an order and it just says cancelled. These exchanges dont seem like they can handle any of this volume or something.
Kraken, Poloniex, Gemini, etc etc
 It really makes me question what's going to happen when large volume holders all want out at once in the next correction...
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:41:52
The more I read about how some people genuinely think banks and fiat currency are going away because of bitcoin really drive home the bubble mania for me.
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:26:01
I totally believe in buttcoin
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:17:56
I'm in the same boat. It's like dating a crazy girl. Regardless of what happens this is hilariously fun.
In two weeks I've learned this about Bitcoin: it's definitely going to go up or down.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:50:12
I've had nothing but good experiences. Just yesterday they sent me 60k in cash for no reason at all. (lying) They are phenomenal!
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:37:39
A lot of people are about to lose a shit load of money they can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:02:02
Yes Houston has changed quite a bit lately. Getting more expensive by the day.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:38:53
I don't think there's anyway of knowing, but I bought in at 2300 as a hedge. A hedge against being on the sidelines if this keeps defying all pre-concieved notions and probability and continues to go up, hits mainstream adoption, and keeps exploding. That said, I do believe bitcoin will soon correct to 1500 or lower. But it also might not. It doesn't behave exactly like other commodities. In a year it could be $100 a coin, or it could be $10000. Just never spend what you cant lose. If bitcoin goes to zero it will have zero impact on my quality of life and emotional state. If you lose 1000$ and it would "hurt" you, then don't do it. Put it in real estate if it's money you need. Just my .02!.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:57:45
DAAAAYUMM yeah thats a win man. I'm totally new to Bitcoin since it's become a thing. Did everyone with stuff at Mt Gox just lose it for ever?
EDIT: Nvm I've researched this. Forgot I had already read about it.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:06:23
Oddly Coinbase never goes down for me. In TX
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:32:35
Who owns how much of something has nothing to do with decentralization. 
That being said, crypto isnt actually decentralized. There is an extremely small group of people who actually control what happens to it, and there are literally hundreds of companies/individuals who could single handedly set the market to whatever-fucking-price-they-want-including-0 if they felt like it.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:58:15
You're on! If you win I will send you 5$ of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:23:55
kinda shocking how many individuals legitimately think something can just go up forever
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:35:07
Yeah they most likely do. 
I sold at 2800 today. Gunna pick it back up at sub 2400. I don't like the way it's behaving right now at all. But long term I'm bullish as hell.
Edit : I also think in the next few days people will begin to leave crypto completely until after August 1st. So I'm just kinda waitin...hope I get my chance!
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:43:44
For VC/startup/speculation funding I agree completely.
I think we probably agree on 95% of this stuff after rereading the thread.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:51:45
It's gunna get bloody that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:31:05
From the way this chart looks, everyone is going to sell. And the bubble will be complete.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:21:21
Yeah they don't want to hear this. The kool-aid here is so strong.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:33:34
Bitcoiners on reddit are zealots, be prepared for a healthy dose of salty, snarky, pompous smugness.
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:43:00
If you truly believe this, I'm willing to bet you're about to lose a shit load of money in the next few months.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:57:30
People are against it because they are nerds and BTC has become as much as a hobby for them as an investment. They want more hard drives to deal with in their lives.
Don't be a nerd. Leave your buttery biscuits on Coinbase. It makes it even more terrifying. Buttery Buttery Buttery Buttery Biscuits Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:25:15
I think bitcoin will definitely reach a dollar amount at some point in the future.
