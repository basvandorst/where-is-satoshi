Are support is currently $7,200-$7,300 and so far we are holding it very well IMO.
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:33:00
Is it debit

Robinhood doesn't allow withdrawals due to strict regulation. They claim that in the future it should be possible
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:25:59
I had the same problem. I bought 0.1 Bitcoin and was planning to withdraw and I found out I couldn't. I just sold and withdrew the money and went to coin base and sucked up the fees.
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:34:25
I don't know
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:31:04
I miss those prices
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:00:45
Hey we're still holding
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:25:54
People would die for those returns ass hole

If it does. Stop looking at crypto for a month and then see the prices.

No wonder Bitcoin is so slow��

This guy is an idiot
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:37:33
WHAT DA FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:09:13
Because Bitcoin Cash takes approximately five years for one confirmation
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:13:16
Spread the word. I gave crypto to a friend for his birthday. Stuff like that helps.
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:16:53
You make a good point but this is demand and supply (I realize that supply creates its own demand but hear me out.) Fiat Currency will have no demand and therefore decreasing value. And back to the point about stabletokens, IMO stable tokens will be pegged to metals like gold, silver, copper, Platinum etc. Because in a few decades studies and analytics state Bitcoin alone would be 40-50% of the forex market. Not including alt coins. Fiat won't have value and I believe the people will use crypto and central banks will use metal backed stabletokens. These are my two Satoshis.

IBM is in my opinion trying to infect big companies with what I call "Blockchain FOMO" which is they tell companies to not miss blockchain by using IBM. But IBM is a centralized database that runs a closed blockchain that only they and the companies they are serving can view.
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:29:13
I meant if they didn't create any FUD it would be smooth sailing

CNBC can go fuck itself
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:23:01
Buy if BTC drops to 6k then one can safely buy
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:55:39
The value of Bitcoin is it isn't run by a centralized power and this gives us freedom from tyranny of control of the Fed
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:37:12
Don't buy it won't work

Btc 100,000 if it weren't for the ENTIRE COUNTRY OF JAPAN.

Tomorrow: BTC 6K
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:27:54
This prediction is low
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:54:20
JK you here a good argument. I personally believe we can fix all of these problems as a community but I am a little mad at the prices and I get mad when doubt enters the environment at crucial times like these
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:31:53
No NOTHING can stop the Crypto movement the only way to stop it is to shutdown the internet.
The government has acknowledged it's existence the price will go up no matter what. The FUD and the MSM are driving the price down.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:25:29

@_date: 2018-03-18 17:21:10
Keep calm and HODL on! ��
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:36:46
It is a HODL then buy your Lambo scheme

I don't want anyone to miss out on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:07:15
Find a bitcoin ATM that accepts cash nearby and send them to a wallet on your phone. Good Luck

Income tax had to be passed by Congress as an AMENDMENT to the Constitution. Our founding fathers would be pro-crypto HODLers.
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:25:14
HODLing during the lows were so worth it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:35:31
I wondered whether the title could be misinterpreted. Sry
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:22:24

Unless you're going to buy back in

Very smart. Friedrich Hayek has a good economic policy as well.
