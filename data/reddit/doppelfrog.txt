Did you mean to reply to the OP?

Give it time; you'll be paying for a carwash with bitcoins soon enough.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:59:19
He'll have more luck with Paypal than with BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-17 02:55:50
The whole comment was unwarranted.
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:16:29


Compared to what?
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:08:23
Do you have a better one?
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:47:33
Detailed technical analysis from the Institute for Rectal Extraction.
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:08:56
He's certainly not here for English advice.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:23:17
The only bottom is yours, which you've pulled this prediction from.
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:53:23
Yes you do.
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:20:50
Tell me how you do anything useful with Bitcoin without involving a bank.

....and it's down again:  USD 7541 and falling.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:22:00
Or tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:19:41
Have you learned your lesson?  :-(
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:20:42
Why don't you pay them instead of speculating on a wildly volatile 'currency'?
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:23:56
What's your point?
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:07:53
You're only supposed to hodl.

If by "informed" you mean "a random stranger on the Internet", then sure.
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:18:10
Just when I think this sub couldn't get any more retarded.
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:17:35
My nipples explode with delight!
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:18:55
That's no moon...
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:53:41
You forgot the "/s"  tag.
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:56:45
Not any more...
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:21:26
Every time I think that this sub couldn't get any more retarded, I end up unpleasantly surprised.

@_date: 2018-10-24 01:43:14
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:39:30
It's flowing.  Just not to Bitcoin.

How long do you have to wait for your Coke payment to be confirmed?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:17:10
Or down.
Who knows?
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:17:21
Wow, that must be a pretty awful fund.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:41:22
8.5 or 8.5k?
Either seem likely.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:32:54
I thought it was ?
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:40:50
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:17:54

The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent.
@_date: 2018-06-10 11:19:20
That's a much better track record than crypto.  What's your point?
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:09:17
Tell us exactly what you're going to do with your Bitcoin that, despite all the volatility, is still worth one Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:11:57
Very funny You just forgot the /s tag for sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:17:07
You're a Zionist operation.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:04:01
The people who bought at 15K are feeling like the world has ended...
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:08:41
Good judgement comes from experience.
Experience comes from poor judgement.
@_date: 2019-02-23 23:29:27
Leaving cash on the window sill seems like a better idea than 'investing' in crypto.

In today's episode of SFYL...
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:53:05
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:32:35
Make sure you use plenty of lube, they look scratchy.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:34:14
You'll be buying a lot of it then...
BTC has lost 75% of its value in the past 12 months.
@_date: 2018-11-01 07:30:53


There, fixed it for you.
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:57:32
Currency of the future!
Edit:  Very, very distant future that is.
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:34:38
Until it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:13:21
is leaking.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:13:34
Sounds like a good swap.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:28:30
Even Reddit Silver's worth more than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:56:31
As opposed to a Bitcoin dessert.
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:27:16
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:39:53
How long before you stop accepting it?
@_date: 2018-11-01 07:26:59
Nor any regulations.

I wouldn't.
I'm also lost for words.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:57:53
Correct.  *Has*
And then there's the volatility.  Wow.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:09:28
Such as?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:32:53
If by "investment" you mean "wild speculation".
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:40:19
Not to mention how spectacularly leaky the cryptocurrency bucket is.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:39:33
Only if you want to starve.
@_date: 2019-01-20 11:42:14
Currency of the future!
Mass adoption imminent? 
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:08:32
There's a "need" for P2P currency?  
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:10:24
Let me take a guess... No.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:47:44
So his boss pays the same amount of USD each time?
That's ok then (for the boss);  the employee is carrying the risk.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:38:57
Because cryptocurrency.   (More specifically, an 'asset' that's lost ~80% of its 'value' in the past 12 months is hardly a resounding success.)

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:39:29
What fundamentals?
Edit:  Some light reading 
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:58:14
If only there was an easier way to use money when travelling...
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:55:20
| What I do know for a fact is that when it is 2021 bitcoin will be over 6 figures
You're right!
$0.00456  is definitely 6 figures.
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:59:45
That's not really how anti-money laundering laws work...
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:00:00


Unlike you, who clearly didn't read it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:33:09
Why would he agree to this this?
Bitcoin is quite volatile (compared to, say, paying you in other currency).
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:58:48
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:48:22
2022:  It's too late...to sell.
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:26:33


They already think that.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:59:18
...that he didn't use?
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:58:23
Wait until he dies?   
Great idea.  Then he won't have to worry about Bitcoin any more.
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:55:29
And yet it has over 100 upvotes...

It's nothing compared to the sigh of relief when I don't have to pay for primary care.  Yay for socialised medicine.
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:21:10
You forgot to mention:
- No other currency can you give you such a wild volatility ride.   Thrill at the excitement of not knowing what it will be worth tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:54:29
And how much money we can make.
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:07:06
So how can I with Bitcoin:
- pay my rent?
- buy groceries?
- pay my utility (gas/water/electricity) bills?
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:59:46
I rest my case.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:43:05
It's almost as if there's no reliable way to predict the price movements...
@_date: 2018-12-30 07:55:18
Oh, I get it now.
Obvious troll is obvious.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:22:32
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:38:31
I rest my case.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:13:02
At least something is moving up in Bitcoin land.
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:27:35
I can't tell if this is satire or not.
Bravo OP,  well done!
@_date: 2018-12-30 05:53:00
So in other words, it's useless as money?
