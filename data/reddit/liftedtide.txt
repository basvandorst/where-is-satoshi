I had issues withdrawing LTC from Coinbase to Trezor. Had to use the legacy address to get it to let me send it.

$300,000 doesn't come that easy though.

No one can tell you what is going to happen. 
Buy what you can when you can and look long term.

Do they refund all wire transfer fees? I thought they would only refund the fee from the wire transfer you have to do for verification?

I can ACH as well. Mostly likely varies based upon the state you live in and who you bank with.

If you had access to the account through online banking you may still be able to print statements off yourself. If not you’ll need to contact your bank for copies. You may have to pay for them since your account is no longer open, depending on your institution.

Have you logged into coinbase.com, not gdax.com, and checked your BTC wallet there?

Will your children your assets (bitcoin). Be sure to include the recovery phrase, as well as instructions on how to recover your wallet in your will. Needless to say you would want to keep this document in a secure place or with an attorney you trust to adjudicate your will.

Happened to me the other day, I was trying to withdrawal to a private wallet from GDAX and it never shown up. Turns out they got withdrawn to the Coinbase wallet for some reason.

Shame. Thanks for the reply

Much appreciated my friend, you've been a great help.

Thank you. Also, what would be the recommended service i send them too? I don't have a paypal account. Is the Coinapult BTC to email service viable for making BTC purchases anywhere?

I downloaded the wallet just before i seen this. it is currently syncing, but on bitinstant the option to send to a bitcoin address has strangely disappeared and now only Virwox, paypal, vouchx, and bitstamp remain?
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:57:27
same problem here. bitinstant only accepts cash for bitcoins so only options are to sell it to someone for cash (80$-90$?) and buy the bitcoins thru bitinstant at cvs or walmart. (possibly monday if their cash service is back up by then)
