Never ever do anything financial on a friend's computer! Especially one with a security level of"filthy".
Might want to tell him his computer is likely compromised

Can I give you more addresses to test? They don't belong to me, honest.
Don't give a dollars worth to scammers.

Butt holding, an advanced technique of currency speculation.
I tried to help out others with this but ended up in jail.

July 2011.
I thought it would change the world when I read the white paper and bought some as soon as I could. I wish I'd bought more.

Wow. The cash you get from the atm has traces of cocaine on it and they make up that excuse for bitcoin?

Given the benefits of bitcoin to the world, either are justifiable.

Can you explain the giving username and password thing? Generally giving someone my baking username and password sounds about the dumbest thing one could do.

Just number of blocks after and including your transaction. Since they depend on prior blocks to be correct, each block makes the block that contains your transaction more confirmed.

If you want publicity, put $5000 into a bitcoin address. Then arrange people into the private key. First person to identify and use it gets the money.
