You can send the coins through mixers or you can swap between different cryptocurrencies and all that. If you try hard enough, even if they know perhaps the original address you put your coins on (which isn't self-evident), you are practically anonymous.

It still is. The one with the copyright is the one who has the right to copy.

I'm not sure Mark would've known that.

Or just hire people with some sort of competence and let that ego off for a while letting MtGox actually work. Too late now.

Isn't ROT13 encryption? Bad encryption, but still encryption despite not having a key (arguably 13 would be the key but it doesn't make much sense since it is baked into the algorithm).
