It does. Just not with humans.

Couldn't this kind of websites just log every password people check for and add them to those password lists hackers have? Or something?

That's what I thought but my girlfriend didn't believe me. Now I can tell her that a stranger on the internet said I'm right!

Alright. But I guess there could still be malicious versions of this kind of password checking sites, right? Like could someone track your internet history through IP and match the passwords you've checked against on the site to accounts you have or something?
Edit: Seems I'm having problems with reading comprehension.

Ah, right sorry. Seems I didn't take in what I was reading.
What I tried to get at was: I've seen sites you write your password in to check for its strength. Could what I described happen with that kind of site?

I myself am a newbie too so take this with a shitload of salt but...
From what I've read it seems that what's happening now is the price settling after people trying to get free coins out of the fork are getting back to their respective altcoins and the hype cooling down at the same time with an attack from "Big Money Boys" trying to steer attention to Bitcoin Cash. The "BMBs" are exploiting a problem in the Bitcoin block size and artificially driving the price of transactions up. Theoretically this exact problem is not present in Bitcoin Cash (it has other problems though). Bitcoin Core has some solutions for the problem, it's just that it's not ready to launch them yet because they don't want to make mistakes and in normal days the block size isn't yet a problem because there isn't so many people using BTC.
If I'm wrong, I hope someone will come and correct me.
