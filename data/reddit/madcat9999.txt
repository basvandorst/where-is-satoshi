Been a positive experience for about 10 months, been making regular deposits and bitcoin purchases, up until my last SEPA transfer that went out from my bank April 4th and has yet to be credited to my Bitstamp balance as for April 13th (usually takes 2-3 business days). I've contacted their support and sent them a transfer verification document which they acknowledged of receiving on April 11th and are proceeding to locate the money.
I'm fairly confident they'll locate the missing deposit over the next week so wasn't going to start raising hell over it but since this question came up, thought I'd share.
Update: Deposit credited on April 14th.

That's right, if the merchant used Coinbase then Coinbase just moved dollars from OPs account to merchants account (because of 'buy back') and no Bitcoins needed to be involved... There's a lot of talk ([Bitcoin: the Stripe perspective]( of using Bitcoin primarily as a transaction medium but this even bypasses that aspect.

This isn't possible with Bitcoin, but programmable money and smart contracts like this are the core idea of  project.
