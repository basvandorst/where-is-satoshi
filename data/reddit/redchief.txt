I haven't been to a restaurant that had credit card acceptance and then I came back and it didn't. Nah son.
In the United States the machines are at the kiosk/ point of sale machine and they take your card and come back with it.  In the foreign countries I've been the person working comes over to the table with a portable credit card machine. Looks like fruad is a bigger problem out side of the United States. See I always use my bank credit card to pay for everything so if there's is a a fraudulent charge i report it to my bank and it gets fixed :)

It's is not everywhere. Every restaurant I go to in my metro area takes credit card. The only cash only would be a taco truck but even they switched to taking cards.

That's cool those 10 charges will be returned to me. That's the beauty of using the banks money instead of mine. Hell one time I left the money in the ATM . I called the bank, they checked the video and they confirmed that I didn't get the money and they gave me it back.

Wait so I'm a sheep because my bank is good to me?? Haahah because they hold my money and secure it? Because I have never had any bad experiences with the bank? Because they return whatever charges I didn't make? Lolol if that's the case baaaaaaaaaa!! Can't pay my mortgage with Bitcoin... How do you suggest I handle that non sheep?

 This isn't about the color of your skin or your financial situation. This is about an obvious scam that people didn't care about as long as they got theirs. They will get theirs in due time.

We Americans have no problem. It's everyone else who tries to take the US dollar to a other country that has a problem. Y'all act like every other country doesn't want to have cold hard US dollar.

You mean you didn't notice Tether was a scam? This post reeks of shilling tether. I'd rather take a person who went through school for this report than some tether shiller who typed it up in their home office which is really a computer in their bedroom. 
The shit started to smell real bad when they claimed to be ready for an audit but kept pushing it back. Also creating all that tether out of thin air. Those red flags we're waving real early.

Couldn't pull out your phone and use the app or the website? No phone? Time traveler from the 1990's?

What firm? The Firm: Nas, Foxy, AZ Cormega? Or was it my firm, Crypto Firm?

Are you serious? Did you not graduate past the 12th grade? 
How about this. Do you want this "doctor" who googled how to operate and blogged about it at night before going to bed  to operate on your heart or would you want a medical doctor that went to school for 8+ years and practices their craft and can back it up with a degree ?  
This is a bag holder ladies and gentlemen.

Only whales and high BTC holders feel the pain. Oh the folks that can manipulate the market? 
Quit acting like there aren't folks that all they do is figure out ways to scam the system. This is a world wide platform that has all the snakes looking to feed. Just look at many of the 2018 ICO projects.  Yeah I agree that the system that is trying to "protect" us is for their own control but at the same time I don't want these folks taking advantage of the situation. 
If by now people still have a problem with KYC is they hold a lot and want to lay low. If someone needs to move more BTC sign up to KYC and move it. What's the problem with that? Taxes? Pay your share and move on.
