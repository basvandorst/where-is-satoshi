Dude is batshit crazy. Called for more guns in schools after Sandy Hook, voted against an anti-domestic violence bill, claimed that Janet Reno planned the whole Branch Davidian thing.

Yeah, I sent them another message four hours ago, and have heard nothing. Just a bit worried as they claim the transaction didn't go through, but it obviously did. I just don't know how they can take my money immediately, and then sit on it with very little communication.
@_date: 2014-06-02 05:40:35
actually. they had a few good reviews, and several people had mentioned it in passing..
@_date: 2014-06-02 11:08:02
Yes, they refunded me. Still not sure what the issue was, but I did get my money back.

Every ~~dollar~~satoshi you are spending goes right into the regime's pockets.
@_date: 2014-01-19 12:59:14
Still rabidly insane on all other issues.

Yeah, and Japanese culture all came from China.
Half Rife 3 confirmed.

Hell no, not with all his other views.

Do NOT use bit2gift, they are [scammers!](
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:30:39
Just some r/chinacirclejerk action...

Ha, I actually made about 20% because of the price changes. Coinbase has a 1% fee afaik.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:20:53
10k a month? what are you, poor?
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:56:30
also, anyone here in china looking to sell? sorry to threadjack, but i've had no luck with localbitcoins, all the sellers seem to be scammers...
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:28:46
Not sure what Khan Acadamy is. I'm an American, teaching at an international school, in English.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:31:17
Yep, 2FA as well!
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:18:01
Not a bad sentiment in general, but for these type of transfers I'm pretty much buying/selling within a few minutes. Could always be a flash crash, but what can you do.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:05:32
Yes. And in 1979 there was a capitalistic counter-revolution, leading to the China we see today.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:29:43
Fuck paypal. They are scum to begin with, but you can't fund RMB into paypal without a huge hassle. There's also a Chinese government imposed $50k yearly limit as well.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:38:17
localbitcoins has zero [fees.](
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:28:50
Deep web? What a stupid title.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:36:14
I agree. While 1% is okay at ~$1000, at 10k or 100k (TO MARS) it's unreasonable. Like tx fees, a flat fee is better.
@_date: 2013-12-28 10:52:40
Not for most people with a white collar job...
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:01:58
i AM a real teacher, faggot. I don't mean a 50 hour a week training school like you :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:27:40
Yes, which is perfect for me. I'm American, with American debts.

My VPN?
