Using a site like localbitcoins or Torescrow (  ) you can convert your BTC directly to cash without any banks who report that kind of stuff to the IRS.

TorEscrow has a CAD exchange, requires no ID. Right now they have open registration.

It currently supports EUR, USD, GBP, CAD, AUD but really only the USD market appears active. 
You place buy and sell orders like MtGox and are automatically matched with the best market price. If you have a large order, you are matched with several smaller sub-orders. 
Each sub-order is its own escrow transaction. You can review each sub-order and reject or accept each sub-order until your order is complete.
The fee is as low as 1% for trusted users. And 6% for users with no trust. As you complete more orders your trust goes up and your trade fee goes down.

Bitcoiners are not necessarily libertarians FYI. Libertarianism is a stupid short sighted ideology that leads to monopolies and corporate fascism. 
Some of us are capable of believing that the government has some purpose such as allowing people to democratically allocate money for community projects. Instead of selling their power to corporations and banks.
 Especially when corporations have no contract directly with the public to guarantee rights and freedoms.
If you think bitcoin is inherently libertarian you are seriously missing the point.

I thought libertarians had no issue with self censorship.

Seriously fuck Visa and Mastercard. Any solution that still allows them to take ~3% out of every transaction is treading water.

I came here to say that so I will just stick with: That is racist and not very clever or well done.

Already exist. 
Like Localbitcoins but can't be shutdown. TorEscrow ( is like localbitcoins but outside government reach and has a trading engine like mtgox.

The market hasn't picked up for GBP yet but it is worth looking into. TorATM is an anonymous p2p exchange with real-time matching.

I thought it ended when it was proven to be stupid and the guy who invented it renounced it as sociopathic.

Or rarely ever do, meaning its a perfect strategy in a case that never happens in reality. Meaning its a shitty strategy.

Why the inventor disagrees with his idea now saying he was not mentally stable when he came up with it.

No thats a fact proven by ATT and other large corporations over and over. If anything schools promote corporatism.

It is quite misleading to look at it from a log scale, no?
