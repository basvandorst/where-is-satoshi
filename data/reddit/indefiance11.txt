Here is something many people haven't realized:
One day some major power in opposition to the US will realize that if they can't have the world reserve currency, its better to take it away from the US and have no single power in control of the world reserve currency.  Bitcoin is their friend.
Why?  the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Bitcoin is the best thing that ever happened to china and russia in the Currency wars. They still think they can win, so they don't like it because Its a stalemate, so they don't see it as a victory, but eventually they will realize a stalemate is better than defeat.  When that happens, they will do an abrupt 180, and since the rest of the world is already defacto endorsing Crypto and using it as a true reserve currency, nothing: no laws, no lobbyist, no elite bankster will stand in the way.

I laughed out loud when I realized your entire rhetorical point (which you seem to think is a valid argument) amounted to nothing more than adding the word "hardcore" in front of libertarian.  Poison the well much?

I think you have a point.  I think the US Empire will eventually fall, just like the Roman Empire, and for many of the same reasons and it may be sooner than any of us think. Those countries who oppose crypto will be bankrupted in the long run as the rising powers in the 'second-world' ride the wave to prosperity and fortune.  In the end, freedom always produces wealth...
