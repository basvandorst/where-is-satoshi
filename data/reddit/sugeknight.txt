WtF is Krugman talking about "Hundred dollar bills are seeing diminishing acceptance."?  I have never met anyone or any business owner reject a $100 bill.

What makes you think that the money they have is good money compared to the $100 bill I am paying with?  It is more likely for lower denomination bills to be counterfeit as they are not checked as often as bigger bills.

If you want power away from the central banks, then you will have to use bitcoin in an everyday function.  If you are just going to collect it and never spend it, then you are turning it into the Sacagawea dollar coin; which was meant for currency, then eventually removed, because it became a collectors piece only.

You are correct, it must be treated like a full currency (spend and replace) and not be exchanged back to start to take on the central banks.

I can promise you that gold is always an option.  The reality is that no one is enforcing that and when times get tough, gold is one of the first things to sell.  Gold comes in more forms than coin, bullion, certs.

Well, if it s a joke, then why did gold 3x during the recession?  My point was that people were still buying it, regardless of the executive order.

Yeah, bring currency to the western society is just like telling a couple of friends about it.

Not saying that all sustainable power was to go down, but a grid can be brought down by the right people.  Agreed may be going a little apocalyptic in my thought here.

As stated, may have been a little to apocalyptic, but yes, this is kinda where I was going with the question.
