Those banks and PayPal are going collect your CIP, which would be the antithesis of bitcoin.

I would turn this question on its head.  What do you think about using a currency which, if stolen, is gone forever with no way to trace or retrieve?
In my view, this is the reason bitcoin in its current form won’t take over.

Bank notes are merely the physical form - it’s most useful to compare Bitcoin to USD or GBP or Euro or whatever.  Not the physical notes.


If you know what you are doing you can do almost anything.  There are 6+ billion people who don’t know what they’re doing and most never will.


Again, you’re just focused on physical currency.  The real comparison is a traditional mobile wallet, which if my money is stolen I can actually get it back!  I had $1,000 taken out of my debit account once — the bank refunded my money because they knew who I was as a result of their CIP program and could identify through surveillance it wasn’t me who took the money out.  I also can place a freeze on my account where nobody can get the money.
If you want to compare bitcoin to paper notes, go right ahead but I’d suggest thinking more critically before putting a bunch of money into it.  This is coming from a bitcoin investor.
I predict it will never take over, for the very reason so many people love it.  If you lose your keys, or your wallet is hacked, ur fucked.  What % of ppl who’ve owned bitcoin have lost them in hacks or, to avoid that, lost the keys they stored outside their wallet?  It’s pretty fuckin high, and keep in mind the ppl who own bitcoin today are among the smartest and tech savviest, and some of them are losing their bitcoins.  What happens when grandma has to use bitcoin?
