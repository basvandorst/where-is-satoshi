He is reducing the UTXO bloat from 64 to 1. So the question is, what is more important? RAM (UTXO size)? or disk space and bandwidth? and are the current incentives aligned to prefer any of those?
If you don't understand the question, Andreas explained it in detail here:

Shhh... don't [tell]( the big blockers, they think Bitcoin still has 1MB. ;)

BTC devs released Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 which included the code to activate the capacity increase.

Just curious, how/when did you hear about bitcoin and what made you decide to buy?

2 or 4mb might be reasonable but bigger blocks is not a goal in itself or something you should aim for, what you actually want is the most transaction throughput with the smallest possible blocks.

Yes, thanks to engineers who know how to scale things, if we were just using more  110MB disks you wouldn't be able to store 20 years of 2MB blocks.
Storage is not an important bottleneck for Bitcoin, who ever told you that has succesfully manipulated you.

For those who missed the first one: 
Scaling vs increasing the blocksize, a HDD-SSD analogy:

doesn't matter for the analogy, ignore the ssd's in the image and its still the same story

You seem to misunderstand the power of BTC devs, as many do. It's not some company who can just decide things for the network. The BTC devs actually made your number 2 choice available for the users in October 2016 after many months of working on it. It was then up to the users adopt it.

Yes, I could decrease the maxmempool but will that fix the 100% cpu also? I'm not worried about the memory usage.

If this was true then the my cpu load would be 100% all the time because the blocks are always full, but if you check the graph it starts around 0:00. I think its too many transactions like others are saying.
