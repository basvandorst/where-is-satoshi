Would you mind citing some examples of this. I've only been on for a couple of months, but I haven't seen anyone saying that Lightning Network would be live and running in a week.
I'd love to see articles, news stories, or others in the community where you're getting these examples from.

I don't either. But I think in 15-20 years, it's very possible—or even likely—that a cryptocurrency is used for a significant portion of major international commerce. I don't know that Bitcoin itself will be that cryptocurrency (it seems most likely that it would be given the network effects, but it also would've seemed like MySpace was likely to be the dominate social network).
I guess it all just depends on your time scales and use-cases.

Holy shit, do you honestly think that even 1% of jokes that are told are original at all?

I apologize. "Pretended" was a poor word choice for what I was trying to convey. "Interpreted" would have been a better word choice on my part. I didn't mean to convey a deliberate intention to take my meaning differently, but pretended clearly does convey that intentionality. Sorry about that. 


I think I have answered the question, but my answer is not what you expect it to be. I haven't given any reasons why the user _should_ stay in Bitcoin, and that's a deliberate part of my answer.
I'm _choosing_ to only scope my answer to: You shouldn't leave Bitcoin solely to avoid the hassle of the Lightning Network. If the Lightning Network is the reason you're considering leaving Bitcoin, I don't think you should. If there are _other_ reasons you're considering leaving Bitcoin, I'm not arguing against those.
I'm not providing reasons for the person to _remain_ in Bitcoin, because I think they should make that decision for themselves. I haven't argued that Lightning is a panacea for the current issues in Bitcoin, because I don't think it is (though I do think it will significantly help). I haven't argued that the user should remain in Bitcoin, because they should do what's right for them.

I mean, you could ask the same question of the internet.
I imagine the answer is: "Yes, there is a small amount of concern, but most of the problems that are raised are addressable with relatively known solutions so it's a fairly low-risk problem".
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:18:17
No other cryptocurrency will be able to scale to the same volume without an off-channel solution either.
It's just not possible to capture a significant fraction of the world's transactions without having a second layer solution.
I don't think there's any reason you _would_ use lightning (or a second layer solution) today. However, in 5-10 years time, you'll want there to be one.
I might put the question to you a different way: Why should you keep using the world-wide-web without going through this entire TCP/IP hassle?
It's a necessary step, and we're still in the ground-floor stage of making anything that approximates a viable world-wide currency.
Sure, if you have immediate, small-transaction crypto needs I think it would make sense to use some other currency (like Litecoin). If you're thinking on 5-30 year time-scales, though, then Lightning Network, or another second layer solutions are absolutely necessary.

Seems like a bold claim to make to someone who said they used it for that reason.
Like, it might not be faster for you (it certainly wouldn't be faster for me), but you need to recognize that other humans are different from you and have different experiences.
If they said it _was faster_ for them, it seems pretty presumptuous to respond with reasons why you don't think it'd be faster.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:20:21
That timescale works for me.
I actually think it'll be more like 15-20 years, but yea, reasonable minds can disagree.
Although, just like with the internet in the 1990s I wouldn't _give it up_ until it got better. I'd just use it within it's limitations of the time. Sure, I wasn't watching Netflix in 1995, but I still enjoyed the internet at the time.

I think you are having two different interpretations of the statement "The network is currently unusable".
You, seem to mean "the network is not currently usable for _everyone_".
seems to have interpreted your statement as "the network is not currently usable for _anyone_".
From perspective, that statement is clearly false.

Well, the USD is backed by the United States government. When things threaten the interests of the United States government, one of the tools it can use to protect those interests is the United States armed forces.
Backing the dollar is one of the primary interests of the United States government.

We focused on different aspects of the question.
You were focused on the why should I _keep using Bitcoin_, while I was focused on the _without going through this entire lightning payment hassle_.
I think my response does answer the _full_ question, as my answer is: "You will need to go through the lightning payment hassle _somewhere_ on _some currency_". It's just a matter of time.
Further, I even noted that there are other cryptos that you can use in the near-term. In fact, I never suggested there was any reason the user should keep using Bitcoin in my response!
Finally, I never said that you need to wait 5-30 year time-scales for Lightning Network to be effective in bringing down bitcoin's cost. I said something _totally different_ about 5-30 year time-scales, and you just pretended I said something that I didn't say.

You didn't say: "it doesn't exist for the general public".
You said: "The core client doesn't even support it".

I mean, they don't really need to close it. They can leave it open and use that channel to make other payments to other people on the network.
Obviously, there's not very many services that you could pay for now on the mainnet (and you shouldn't, unless you're willing to lose the money), but as it starts to be picked up, I would expect to open one channel to a reasonable well connected node, and use that channel for all of my LN payments.

Let me walk it through for you:
* Gets paid in BTC denominated in a Fiat currency.
* Bitcoin price has declined.
* Gets paid more BTC due to the price decline.
* Posts happy post about it
Look. You could even have read a comment from OP to see that it's a happy post:

Trust isn't a binary thing, it is a spectrum.
I don't think a question of "do you trust these results" makes sense. I think the better question is "how much do you trust these results".
I wouldn't bet my life on them being accurate. If you _forced_ me to put money on whether they were accurate giving me even money on it, I'd take the "accurate" side of the bet.
I haven't considered it too deeply, so I don't think I can give a more precise answer than that.
"More likely than not they are reasonably accurate; It's absolutely not a certainty that they are reasonably accurate"

The goal isn't to prevent a recession. The goal is to prevent the collapse of the financial system entirely.
We didn't see W. Germany style hyperinflation, or 1933 style breadlines, so they didn't _completely_ fail.
2008 absolutely wasn't good for the fed, but you can't argue that they flatly failed, since the financial system recovered.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:56
No worries!
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:27:19
That's...not really something the fed can fix.
That requires congressional and enforcement fixes.

I don't understand. They asked if the audit reports were released for the world to see. They clearly are.
I didn't say you should blindly trust the audit reports.
I just answered the question: Yes, the reports are publicly released.

Well, sure it is. Either way, it's an arbitrary club, based on arbitrary definitions.
You don't get to be the sole gatekeeper about which "clubs" exist. Sorry.

I think it's, basically:
* "I open a funding channel with Starbucks for $40." (on-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (off-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (off-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (off-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (off-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (off-chain)
* "Starbucks and I close the account, and I get $15 and Starbucks gets $25" (on-chain)
As opposed to:
* "I buy a latte for $5" (on-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (on-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (on-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (on-chain)
* "I buy a latte for $5" (on-chain)
Apologies for the USD denominated amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:17
You're right! That would be a huge stretch!
You'll also note that I _never_ made the claim. I claimed that the fed is an entity with a goal of trying to prevent financial collapse. That does not mean that they are the only entity with that goal. It also doesn't mean that it is their only goal.
Logically, the claim I made is absolutely not equivalent to the claim you are pretending I made.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:35:47


No. It's totally possible for BTC to go all the way to 0. Network effects of people agreeing that is has value is what gives it value (similar to fiat, gold, etc). If those go away, it's value can become essentially 0.


There's always another cash cow. They could short Bitcoin, watch it go to 0, and then simply move on to another coin that they could pump and dump. They don't care for the future of Bitcoin or the technology. They care for what brings in dollars today.

The third party is neither secret, nor undisclosed. On page 3 of the PDF I linked above, it clearly shows us that the third party that performed the 2016 audit was KPMG, LLP. Their website is here:

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:45:05
Ah, yea, that makes sense in context. My misunderstanding!
I agree that for them to make money off it in the long run, they need to maintain some value in it. I suspect they won't care to do so. They'd be fine with it going to 0, if they make money on the way. They'll also be fine with it gaining significantly, if they make money on the way.

Then have two BTC accounts, and ping-pong the BTC between them every 10 years.
Edit: Just want to say I'm not advocating for or against that proposal. Just that a long-term hold would still be super viable.

Gold is inflationary. More new gold is mined in a year than is destroyed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:03:49


That's true now, but it wasn't true for the last thousand years of history.

Bitcoin is inflationary for now, but not in the long run.
The timelines I care about for cryotocurrency are such that bitcoin is a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:59:51
That's true, enough. I suppose I should have said something like "relatively deflationary".
Since pretty much every other currency is inflationary in some way, Bitcoin will be relatively deflationary compared to other currencies.
Also, private keys do get lost which causes the loss of some portions of the monetary supply, so it will also be slightly deflationary in an absolute perspective.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:47:13
Yes, but there are more and less trustworthy parties that make guarantees...
For example, many people have an _incredible_ amount of faith in the standard savings and checking accounts thanks to FDIC. A guarantee coming from the federal government is a much stronger guarantee than one coming from ViaBTC.
To say that you cannot have _absolute_ trust (while true), doesn't really help those of us that must make decisions based on relative levels of trust.
