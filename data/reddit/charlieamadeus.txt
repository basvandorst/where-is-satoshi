Bitcoin, BTC or $BCOIN on StockTwits is a decentralized value transfer protocol.
It is an anarcho-capitalist wet dream with Neal Stephenson as narrator.
It is a Ponzi scheme, but so is the USD and financial capitalism.
It is used for illicit dealings, but so is the USD and financial capitalism.
It is highly speculative and risky, but so is the USD and financial capitalism.
It is NOT made out of thin air or backed by the threat of violence.
This isn’t like gold or Yen, but there is a tangible, material and real thing of value created by the Bitcoin network.
Fundamentally, BTC is a public transaction history wrapped in a hard math problem. Hard in the sense that it cannot be solved with reasonable funds in a meaningful amount of time using technology in the public domain without violating fundamental assumptions we make about physics, matter and energy.
This has incredible disruptive potential because it challenges the traditional structure of value transfer and undermines the power of government by building a currency without borders.
Today, international money transfers require extensive paperwork, take days to process and cost substantial, sometimes usurious sums. BTC has none of these inhibitors, though there is an increasing amount of friction being created by government regulatory bodies.
