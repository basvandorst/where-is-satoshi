I bitcoiner saying other cryptos are a scam....really? It's one of the top 5 on coinmarketcap for a long time and it is one of the most innovative blockchain out there. Dude, we are all in the same team fighting to break down government monopoly over money, banking and exchanges. Bitshares solves the exchange problem, everyone who's been goxed should be happy about that.

downvote a hierarchical multisig? No body on bitcoin think it's cool and a technology that would be useful for bitcoins?

Everytime I see price control and run the other way

The rabbit hole is deep but after a bit it makes a whole lot of sense.

I am not an expert but from my research, I chose BitUSD. They found a way to add a yield on that thing.

I would suggest you try the platform, that would do better than me trying to explain it.

I'm in love with shapeshift.io, I always keep my funds in BitUSD(I'm allergic to volatility) but when it is time to spend, I can quickly move it to bitcoin and do my purchase. Easy and elegant. Made my life much easier...thank you!

Stop being childish.

BitUSD/Gold/Silver/CNY etc. 
Also they get a yield on whatever they decide to hold.
Finally bitcoin and bitshares cooperating.

Not cool at all. Good luck

It may solve the United-States resident problem but for the unbanked it is not a solution. 
Think of Argentina for example (I know a guy who is almost done creating a wallet with the functionality mentioned in the video.) it's a huge opportunity for bitcoin and bitshares.
