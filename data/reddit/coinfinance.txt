There're always closed groups on FB, you can always ask with a public post about your buyers reference. At the end its a bit of trust what you need.

I also had troubles with my first purchase at coinbase. They white listed me after a few mails. No troubles after that

The charts are breaking it. We were working on a mobile app for iOS, but later we are gonna be finishing our mobile css

Cash or bank deposit, I wait until the buyer send me a photo of the bank receipt, then I send the BTC
Flawless since my last 5 transactions

I have big stakes on altcoins as well, LTC, Doge, DGC, MEC, CGB. (all mined with GPU)
In fact I created a site to track them all, because updating an excel was not enough back in november 2013 :)
Since that time I only keep downgrading my wealth value.
