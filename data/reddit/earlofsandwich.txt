This is interesting. I have an IT company in Colorado - how can I sign up as a reseller also?

No I agree, it's just that what he said is the opposite of how professional traders are taught to think.

That's how Floyd Mayweather gets paid generally. He likes to post pictures of his checks after fights.

Well, it was the way you said what you said.
When you're learning to trade you are taught to be very emotionless about your trades. If you buy something expecting the price to rise, and it doesn't, you have to learn to get out of your losing positions. It is human nature to want to hold on to positions when they are losers because you want to recoup your losses, but holding on to depreciating positions is not the way to do that.
In this case I suppose it doesn't apply really. I assume you are holding long term because you are a believer in the technology, and not just using it as an asset class to  make a quick buck.
I didn't mean any offense of course, it was just what you said pointed at something that traders are taught to ignore.

Probably a smaller percentage than regular currency?

It refers to a huge shorting of the market that happened early October. I can't remember all the specifics, but basically there were a huge number of bitcoin available which kept the price at 300$ until they had all been sold. They all seemed to come from a single party who became the 'bearwhale'. Its subsequent slaying was the consumption of all the bitcoins that were flooding the market and keeping the price at or below 300$.

Thanks for the reply - that's what I thought and until i actually bought something it was something i hadn't considered. I had always wondered in the back of my mind how you interpret payments incoming. Now it's so obvious.

It was called clipping back in the day I think.

How can I sign up as a reseller? It's not obvious on your site..
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:18:31
OP has 100s of thousands of bitcoins.

This would set alarm bells ringing for any trader.

So does this mean essentially, TARP levels of QE over the next year? I decided to do some research about mean years between recessions since 1900 - we are probably due one imminently and this report only supports that.

I think that model is too old for autopilot.

I think you'll find that life no parole means what it says. No one sentenced to life without parole has ever been released on parole in the USA.

I know, I got mine in September last year and then 2 weeks later they announced the 2.0 hardware.... 
Oh well!

I wasn't talking about OP who has the same car as me. I was talking about whose comment thread I'm replying to.

Thanks mate, I have a model X so I know what the blue wheel is for.
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:44:54
Yeah but if you bought them there and waited then they would have disappeared anyway.

I agree, it's great entertainment.

How was he involved? I thought he was just an insinuated scapegoat but there was no actual evidence?

There isn't enough volume in the bitcoin market surely to be a chartist.

There isn't enough volume in this market to look at charts.
