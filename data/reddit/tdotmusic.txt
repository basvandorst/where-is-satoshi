Buy your bitcoin before wallstreet gets them

This process should not be private. It's an open source project for God's sakes
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:22:33
But you can't even use a small fraction a Bitcoin because of transaction fees
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:39:19
I get that, in fact I'm going to be mining very soon to take advantage of this; however, I think this gives bitcoin a bad name especially for people considerring buying it
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:36:55
They have been answered unfortunately the answers come up short when you're talking about making an actual difference for bitcoin and making it into some blockchain that runs tabs (lightning) give me a break. You don't know even know what's better for you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:46
This  is an attack by blockstream itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:28:51
You first! You're cute when you patronize me ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:10
Fees and slow transaction speeds are not FUD. Word is spreading that bitcoin cash is the original vision of bitcoin. Everyone can thank Roger Ver for his continued efforts in this community : - )
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:36:44
They said they would off Bcash because of the fork in the new year months ago. You can find it on google!
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:40:42
Truth of the matter is I sold all my bcash for bcoin because I listened to the cancerous trolls of r/Bitcoin at lows. I only hodl bitcoin. Your theory is incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:06:05
I completely agree with this statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:05:08
If you were to look at the fork strictly from a coding perspective, the only difference you would see is that bitcoin cash is quicker and cheaper. I honestly wish this "bitcoin" at least was 4 mb per block. Lightning and segwit are fail work arounds. Interesting in concept but satoshi said himself that increasing blocksizes for large scale adoptions was inevitable. The whole spam argument is contradicted with bitcoin being antifragile. Bitcoin needs to be able to breathe.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:37:53
Agreed, you wouldn't have to own alot of btc just some. It's frusterating to see such an obvious way of doing things that would make bitcoin more decentralized because more people would contribute to the system and help it.  Pretty rediculous that I get downvoted for being anti-lightening when much simpler scaling options are available and can help with decentralization which seems to be the only thing people care about here. Anyways I'm wasting my time writing this at this point. Have a nice day

Oh man must be such a rush, the adrenaline is probably surging through your body!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:06:54
bittrex had me at 2 then lowered the limit of withdrawal to .4 out of nowhere. I expect fees on centralized exchanges but if you're going to fuck with your customers AND charge a premium I'm out. The base level of making a profit for scalping is not even there so why bother?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:10:04
We all follow a change? Um no fuck that. We should all CONTRIBUTE to the change. Unfortunately the message that we need to upgrade the blocksize doesn't seem to compute with the few holding the githubs repository hostage mean while nobody is making reasonable arguments and using shit sidechain workarounds that mask the blocksize issue with ductape.

Where did I say ANYWHERE that segwit was a good idea?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:14:46
Not me I actually listenned to everybody on this subreddit and sold at 300$... it's now at 1700 usd FML, Don't sell your bitcoin cash because people say its a shitcoin etc.. it's a top 3 coin and coinbase will soon be supporting it.

I do about 180GB per day just for my node with a data cap of 400GB
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:35:07
anybody can run a node, wtf are you talking about
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:50:11
That I did : /

You'd like that, I can tell you have no life!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:35:55
LOL that very problem is the blocksize. Wtf are you talking about? Theif, sock puppet? You know people who beleive in conspiracy theories are generally losers. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:38:08
That applies to any blockchain and to say that applies to any one specifically is a joke
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:47:19
That one gave me shivers 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:17:20
This right here. I've been trying to suggest that they should do an immediate 4 mb upgrade ASAP to deal with the fees, transaction times. People argue spam and also argue that bitcoin is antifragile (makes no sense) People argue centralization with nodes BUT the upgrade can incentivize nodes with rewards. Simple memory upgrad would make a big difference and it's a SIMPLE solution. This isn't fucking 2009 anymore.
 Honestly these garbage work arounds (Lighning tabs and segshit)  and the news stating our high fees is an EMBARASSMENT to the brand name of bitcoin. I wish more of the market share went back to bitcoin but REAL fixes need to occur ASAP!!!!

Bittrex sucks. Move to binance. They lowered my withdraw limit so I've slowly been taking it out NEVER TO USE THEM AGAIN. Their fees are a complete fucking joke
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:20:20
WHo cares, I miss in game purchases. I don't care if it's using a crypto so long as it's using one with low fees. Like Bcash, Lcoin, it doesn't really matter. This is a cause for celebration. Put your differences aside this is a win for the community. It's christmas time &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:14:56
Logical seems to be quite Illogical with his arguments. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:51:30
If they are putting up the UI for Bitcoin cash it only makes sense they will allow for purchase of it. I would purchase bitcoin cash on coinbase for all my purchasing. It's cheaper to make a transaction with bcash than it is litecoin atm
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:43
You realize that you're the one crazy for being so delusional in your assumption
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:40:40
You clearly didn't read the op, I've seen all of his talks and his arguments don't hold up in terms of increasing the blocksize. A 2mb increase would unclog the mempool and reduce fees with a very small impact on bandwith/storage. Well what about spam? There will ALWAYS be spam, in fact the more spamming the better, bitcoin is antifragile right?

Fuck off, these are legitimate concerns and you trying to silence this issue when it is being said by EVERYBODY. The learning curve with bitcoin should not be constrained to the technically savy person but EVERYBODY you fucking snob . You're a piece of shit for calling somebody out on this rubbish!
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:12:37
This is a good thing though right? Bitcoin couldn't be used because of costs. Does that mean that all cryptospace should be hurt because of that. FUCK NO. I want to buy games again on steam. Everyone should be freaking happy! That just means more market share for our space! It's a Christmas miracle! Thanks Bcash! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:25:53
1.Now that the CBOE is allowing for shorting of bitcoin, will you stand by your claim that Bitcoin is a fraud and short it and expose the information that backs your claim that it is indeed a fraud. 
2. Will you be taking investment advice from your daughter seeing as she has likely made massive gains since her purchase
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:23
Bullheaded as well. One for the books!

Terrific News, hopefully steam will now consider using bitcoin (cash) again! Wahoo!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:11:32

Nice ad hominem. Hint: Work on actual useful conversation if you're going to contribute to the conversation. Falacy galore in the comments! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:56:26
I've looked into lightning and think it's a pretty lame workaround. Increase the blocksize. Incentivize node holders with btc to avoid "much decentralization"
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:49:49
Don't tell people if it's good or bad yo sell.i listenned to people telling my it as a good idea to sell Bitcoin cash at 300 because it was a "shitcoin" I'm fucking pissed I sold my Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:21:10
You may not think they're worthy of a thank you but I do! I think they add alot of social proof and credibility to bitcoin as the pioneers of the social network and now they were pioneers in the money network.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:27:05
I'm warning other people not to listen to all the fudding of bitcoin cash. Because like you said it's up to the owner to decide whether or not to keep it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:15:59
This guy is a lying Lcoin sockpuppet
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:13:22
I actually run a node though and the costs are minimal and wouldn't make an impact on the costs associated with running one. As for the spam argument. There will ALWAYS be spam.

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:34:33
Not true. I'm a hobbiest who runs a full node and I fork over 100$ a month running it. I also don't mind since bitcoin has been good to me. I disagree with spam being an issue, all one has to do is compare "spam" to bitcoin cash with 8 mb block size. Spam has never been an issue with bitcoin cash. The spam argument is a boogyman
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:01:02
Incentivize node owners and you will see your precious decentralization
