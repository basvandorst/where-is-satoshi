I'm getting out now. There is no way this trend can continue I don't care what other people say. I've made a profit already. I'm not going to let greed get in the way of getting a return now. I might leave a little behind just in case it continues to rise.

Fees for checking the transaction logs is my understanding.

So how do you have access to your money if you lose power? How do you have access to your money if governments make it illegal to convert bitcoin into real cash which actually has value and is insured by the government when you put it in the bank? How do you have access to your money if your house burns down?

You have your wallet on a drive in your house that burns down. Tell me how you get your money. When you can't exchange your coins for cash no business will accept them.

Could you take that 500 dollars and set it on fire right now? If the answer is no then you should not invest.

Good luck cashing that out lol

Bitcoin is worthless completely worthless until you exchange it for cash. If you think it has any value besides speculation right now your an idiot. I'm done talking to you enjoy losing your nest egg.

What if a law is passed that makes it illegal to exchange bitcoins into your local currency right now? Wouldn't you need to have your other "drive" in another location? What if you get spyware installed on your machine and they capture your wallet and password? Is your wallet insured by the government?

Nobody knows why it's vauled the way it is. It's gambling plain and simple.

It's always been about making a quick buck and always will be since around 2012. It's the greatest pump and dump ever. It will never replace more traditional currencies. We now have big money playing the market now. Prepare for a giant crash. I plan on cashing out on Sunday fuck all this crap. It's too volatile to be an investment and it's too useless to be used as cash. Bitcoin has turned into a penny stock which costs 1,000s of dollars per share.

You need to pay taxes on bitcoin. The fact that you don't know this is hilarious your grossly misinformation. Trust me if the US decides to prevent bitcoin to USD just about every other country will soon follow.

I'll be back on Monday to laugh.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:55
Bitcoin is going to be worthless tomorrow - naw I'm just kidding. Or am I?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:01
Try a drop to levels we saw earlier this year 1k or lower.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:42:14
I got a feeling this is exactly what will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:14:10
This is exactly what is going to happen. I'm getting out now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:43:02
If you bought in so low why in the world have you not cashed out! You're crazy don't let your greed get the best of you get your money out before it tanks. The writing is on the wall and it's going to tank and tank hard. Might even happen before future market opens.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:26:38
It's going to crash much faster than that. It will be unprecedented, tons of new coverage. All designed to shake peoples trust in crypto. Puts tin foil hat on.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:47:35
It's crashing down to sub 1k levels by summer - mark my words.
