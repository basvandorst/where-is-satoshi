You're contradicting yourself.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:12:11
I never said anything about the prices.

I think that is just some troll who sent .0001 BTC with a message.
I don't see any messages with the 29k BTC move.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:24:19
I was talking about his [website](
All he does is talk about how he feels about the issue. He doesn't talk about what his plan to make those changes are.

Yes, that tells us a lot...
You should list your past jobs and experiences, so people know you're competent enough. Also, maybe put more effort into your views on issues...not just 2-3 sentences.
@_date: 2014-05-15 08:46:24


yeah, that is misleading. The coins aren't worth anything, and yet they are trying to sell them. **Anyone can go to coinprism.com and make up a coin.**
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:10:35


...Yes...this is vital information that we should know, but we shouldn't know about your credentials, experiences, or how competent you are.
This is a joke.

this is old news
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:48:23
it's because someone forgot to lock their door 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:50:28
we can't predict the future

It was all planned! Buy before first hearing. Pump price because of "bitcoin lovefest" (the first hearing). Then dump and shutdown bitcoin with second hearing.

Coins can be untainted.

Didn't know the usd varied in value so much.
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:54:14
if you don't keep your promises, you'll get some shit for it
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:36:44
im in love with satoshi too
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:14:09
What if I told you about bitpay. A company that exchanges btc directly to fiat for merchants.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:41:24
just a case for my phone from bitcoinshop.us
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:03:57
It was a joke relax.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:05:42
Exchanging your bitcoins for usd isn't the only way to use your bitcoins. You can actually buy things with it, unlike stock.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:52:15
finally. some people just believe whatever they are told.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:14:31
I agree with your first two paragraphs. 
But what should we do if the price drops, and they lose money?
Price volatility isn't what we want.
