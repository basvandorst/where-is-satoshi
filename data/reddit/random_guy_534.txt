Worst. advice. ever.
"Exchanges that can't be hacked" are simply "unhackable"... until they get hacked.
Or your account can be frozen.  (Never happened to anyone? /s )

I'm very sorry, if you think that having Bitcoin is similar to stacking USD under a mattress, I would suggest educating yourself about Bitcoin, its characteristics and its features.  You'll find that it is quite revolutionary, indeed, and that one of its greatest features is its decentralized way of functioning.  That is, you no longer need to depend on a centralized third party (e.g. a bank, Coinbase or Gemini), with all the abuse and restrictions that can come with it (e.g. loosing access to your coins because of fraud, theft, ID theft, or having _your_ account hacked or _your_ password stolen (no insurance about that, 'mate!), or having your account frozen for whatever reason).  As some people say: you can be your own bank.
Oh, and if you believe there's no need for that, then wait until your Coinbase account is frozen overnight because of a new directive which blocks funds of account holders "to prevent funding terrorism" - too bad your name happens to be "Ali", it's just too suspicious, you know.
Another interesting feature you might like:  You can make a secure and safe "backup" of your wallet.  If your house burns (with your mattress and your computer), you still have your coins.
Quite different, indeed...  :P

You are right, I do agree with you on the fact that it is - unfortunately - still too hard and complex to keep or store coins for the average (or even "below average") user.  Bitcoin would gain a lot from making that easier.
History (that is, "Bitcoin's short history") has clearly showed us, though, that giving up on having safe practices ourselves and instead relying on a third party to ensure our security is not a good behaviour either.  It's not really a matter of "will an exchange be hacked?", but more of "when will an exchange be hacked?"
In a way, we both agree on the same things, I believe.  Let's find a way to make bitcoin easier and safer to use, for everyone.  :)

Coinbase count as an exchange in that regard, yes.
Basically, never leave coins with a third party in control of the private kets (that is, able to move the coins for you).  These structures cannot be 100% fail-safe, and will eventually get hacked.
However, you might need to buy or trade coins, that's obvious.  It's also part of the "risk" - albeit possibly low with Coinbase.  Moving them to cold storage, in your own wallet, or hardware wallet, is appropriate afterwards.  Do not let them stay uselessly on any other website, company, exchange, etc.
All exchanges are 100% safe - until they get hacked.  ;)

IOTA seems *very* new to be reliable upon.  And it is not mineable - so the distribution is not ideal, in my own opinion.  I personally do not trust this coin.  (But, to be honest, I don't know that much about it, so I could be wring.)
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:54:44
Not quite that.
But Litecoin is of a great use right now, as it is entirely secure, has a great team of active developers (dare I say, more than BCH, I should think!), and the network much more "usable" right now: transactions costs a few cents (about $0.05) and confirm within a few minutes.  Wasn't it what was asked of Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-08-26 22:48:33

No, seriously, this is why we need 2nd layer solutions.  Do you think that the *entire* world needs to know of this $5 transaction, and keep that directly in the blockchain *forever*? (I mean, like, still in 5000 years' time?)
Having a system that require every participant in it to see and conserve all transactions of every other participant is, honestly, one of the most inefficient system ever.  It would be like receiving the entire transactions processed by Visa throughout the month with your monthly statement by mail.  (Imagine the size of that envelope!)  Very inefficient.
What we have now, with Bitcoin, is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, trustless payment system.  A great, stable &amp; secure structure for other things to be built on top of it.  The $5 game or coffee transactions can easily happen off-chain, while buying your house (or a Tesla - it seems popular here) can happen on-chain.
Edit: fixed typo and grammar.

The fees are always the same, a percentage - unless you trade a lot, I would suppose, where you would get a reduction.  I believe it is 0.25%.
And if 0.25% of $1,000 isn't too big for you, then 0.25% of $10,000,000 shouldn't be either.
And I always find it funny to hear people complaining that some exchanges are 0.05% cheaper than others by charging 0.20% instead of 0.25% - while bitcoin's price routinely vary by 5% in a day!  (So wait 5 more minutes, and you'll get 0.1% more on your price!)

Fake.  FUD.  OP is a liar.
Warning signs and proof:
1- OP pretends to be a day trader and to have $120K stuck at Bittrex, and pretends to give "10% back to the community as a gift".
Seriously, someone would really give $12,000 "to the community" just like that.  Yeah, sure.
2- The 2nd screenshot of OP "November 09 Portfolio"  lists plenty of balances with completely exact "round" numbers:  1000.00000000 , 10000.00000000 , 500.00000000 , 40000.00000000 , 2500.00000000 , 2000.00000000 , etc.
Anyone whom has every purchased bitcoin or altcoins in his life knows that you never get perfectly round numbers - with the % of fees, the rounding, etc. - especially not for **all** your balances, that would magically arrive all at 00000000 digits!  Any normal balance would like like:  1002.10231623 , or 248.74284241, etc.
3- And the last nail in the coffin:  See OP Reddit post history, of just 5 days ago:
Title:  How to protect my bitcoin before the fork while my funds In Blockchain.Info


 


4- If that was not enough, OP already pretended to have $125,000 blocked on Bittrex, but on Oct. 13th - 9 days before what he pretends in this post (and bitcoin price was much lower then, so he would have needed much more than 21 BTC to get to this amount).


So, yeah, Redditor for 5 months pretending to be day trading with $120K US of money (on a single exchange only), whom doesn't know how private keys work on cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2017-04-21 12:51:07
That's the thing:  You should be able to get your (Bitcoin) private keys and import them into another wallet / software, in order to spend those Bitcoins you own elsewhere.  Without that ability, this is like having a regular bank account, or a "web wallet", and this is very risky as you would be 100% dependent on a third party (Abra), and if they go bankrupt or get hacked, you can loose everything.
I have been told that Abra holds all those funds in Bitcoins, in your own wallet, but I am not sure of that.  I would like clarifications on this.
@_date: 2017-04-21 03:13:34
A quick question about Abra:  Can you extract your private keys from the Abra App, and if yes, how?
Or, said differently:  If Abra were to disappear tomorrow, how can we recover the Bitcoins stored in the Abra app?  Where/how can we use the "backup phrase" to recover our private keys?
@_date: 2017-04-24 01:58:13
0.07 BTC is closer to $100 than to $10.  Wasn't there a "0" missing somewhere in your OP?
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:39:54
Thank you for your reply.
I read in-between the lines that it is then _not_ possible to extract the private keys from the app to import them into another wallet/service would anything be to happen to Abra (the company) itself.
I believe that this simple feature (some code to extract the private keys - even simply generating a QR code, with possibly a number of "Warnings" before that, etc.) would be easy to implement by Abra, and is a crucial feature, in my own opinion.
I wouldn't want to deposit even a mere $100 in the Abra app otherwise, as Abra (through finding myself being 100% dependent on Abra's server availability as well as the good financial standing of the company) would always be in a position to (involuntarily, I agree) completely cut me off from accessing my funds, and as at any time.  That is a situation which would be worse than with a bank, as Abra is not FDIC insured and doesn't fall under the same regulation as banks do.  Putting money into the Abra app would then be a simple act of faith and trust, which I am not willing to do.
So I do strongly encourage Abra to implement that feature, and to not ask its users to engage in the unhealthy behavior of placing themselves in a dependent situation in regards to Abra.
You can do better than that, I know it!  :)

I am saddened to hear that.  So then that's completely useless.  :(  It is not a backup at all, you are still chained to the Abra company, and sink with them if they do.  (We all want to see Abra succeed, however true decentralization is an indicator of resilience and stability, and users will not choose Abra if it doesn't have those.  I certainly wouldn't, at the very least.)


And could you easily send your BTC to another BTC address (a non-Abra address) afterwards?

It might be a bit of trouble for you, but here is a likely way to recover your coins:
This is based on the fact you said that restoring your seed worked correctly on Android 9 beta.  Basically, you just have to replicate the environment that did work.  Reinstall Android beta, Samourai Wallet and everything else you had.  Restore your seed there.  You'll likely regain access to your coins that way.  After that, simply send your coins elsewhere, to another wallet of yours, that you know works well.  Then reinstall the Android version you need.
Good luck with that.

@_date: 2017-10-10 13:38:31
I agree with what you wrote, with a small nuance:  A good (and secure) 2FA implementation will prevent 2fa code reuse.  That is, the website *should* give you an error and refuse the operation if you try to reuse the same TOTP code you have already provided, forcing you to wait a maximum of 30 seconds to get a new, unused, code.  I got that error myself on a website once, and I was happy of it.
With that, even if an attacker got into your account, they wouldn't be able to withdraw coins or making security changes on your account.  (They could possibly trade and dilapidate your coins, though, or use your account to move the market in their favor in different ways - e.g. helping to pump a specific coin, or spending all your coins into specific orders made by the attacker from another account at the same exchange to "transfer" the coins to his account with a small loss, etc.)
Without that "no reuse" mechanism, TOTP is relatively easily bypassed, as you correctly explained.
So even if you have a keylogger on your computer and you get to a phishing site, and your logins are compromised, and your email account is compromised, an attacker would *not* be able to withdraw your coins if your account is correctly protected with a secure 2fa implementation (that is, withdrawals and account change requiring unused 2fa, etc.).

@_date: 2017-09-28 17:37:51
Important nuance:  No, you do *NOT* control your own keys.
Abra pretends that they do not have access to your keys, however there is no way for you to export your private keys from the Abra app.  I repeat:  You have absolutely no access to those keys.  (And Abra's support wrote that these keys would only work in Abra anyways.)
Conclusion:  You are still tied to Abra, and do not control your own keys.  If Abra goes down, good luck recovering your coins.
IMO, this is a major flaw with Abra - which has an otherwise good business model -, and this should be corrected.

No, the point is that the genesis block really started the day it was supposed or announced - as opposed to secretly mining alone for many days (or weeks, or months) before making the chain public.

Simply sit down, relax, and take your time for doing this.  Nothing needs to be rushed.
I believe it could be helpful to have a trusted and knowledgeable person come to your place and do this work with you.  Like a IT consultant, or something like that.  Someone whom knows what they are doing.  If you truly believe you have that many bitcoins - or even if you "only" have a few -, that person's hourly fee would be a very good investment.
And do not fear about having that much money.  Bitcoin isn't illegal, no more than having 50 kg of gold in your basement.  I would suggest to act as a good citizen and pay your taxes on your capital gains, though.  (And those taxes depend on were you reside.)  Nothing difficult nor dramatic to do.

I believe learning bitcoin is not that difficult, but there are still a few traps to be avoided.  With a few hundred dollars, its easy to plan around &amp; learn.  With a few million dollars, it would seem wise to me to seek counsel and to be 100% sure not to make any mistake.
The size of the risk can also make people somewhat dizzy.
Walking in balance on a narrow sidewalk, beside a street is easy.  Nobody falls - and if there is a fall, you fall from maximum 1 feet high, it's no big deal.  Walking on a ledge of the same width, but at the top of a skyscraper is quite different.  It would make most people shake and tremble, even though it requires no different skills than walking on the normal sidewalk.  Falling from that height would hurt more, indeed.
So if you have to walk on that higher ledge, I wish for you that you make yourself a good setup.  If you need to deal with 46 million dollars, and you're not entirely sure of what to do (like if you feel the need to post on reddit for advice!), then I'd suggest you gather a trustworthy team around you to support and guide you on that.
Hell, if you're not sure whom to trust, offer $10,000 to one of the core developers, or anyone whom is highly visible and highly skilled, they surely will be able to help you without ripping you off!

Then again, if you have 46 millions to invest in the stock market, do you just "read up on it on your own", or do you seek advice from a trustworthy wealth management advisor?  You still think you can learn in a few days the equivalent of a few years of experience in the field?
A dishonest IT consultant (or wealth management advisor) could easily steal money/coins, yes, but an honest and reliable person could also prevent that user from making a 20 million dollar mistake, and advise him in critical ways.

So if Litecoin would have the same usage as Bitcoin right coin (i.e. if everyone would be using Litecoin instead of Bitcoin) the blocks would still be far from full (way below 50% of capacity), and so there would not be any upward pressure on the fees.  The fees would still be as low as they currently are.
On top of that Litecoin just locked in segwit, which will allow for LN, increasing tremendously the capacity of the network.  So, again, the fees wouldn't be higher on the Litecoin network, and it could process 100 (?) times more transactions than the current Bitcoin network.
If a highway is congested, with high tolls on top of it, why wouldn't you use this other brand-new alternate highway, with 4 times more lanes, and with extra speedy mass transit system (LN) built within it?
I would use that.

BTC-e, Poloniex, Kraken, GDAX, Bittrex, etc.  All major exchanges, actually, save for a few.

Is it just me, or that infographics looks like a huge space rocket - with Bitcoin being the top of it.
You know where it's going?  :P

I hope that, in 6-7 years, that Bitcoin pizza becomes another "2 million dollar pizza".  :P

That's why I believe another chain, like Litecoin, can/will be used for small payments, like a coffee, or anything else.  (See my other post above.)  And maybe another faster chain for micro-payments, why not?

With a $5M net worth, I suppose there's a good likelihood you have an accountant doing your yearly taxes.  I would refer to him/her for the specifics regarding taxation of capital gains (and if buying and selling of Bitcoin is considered as such in your area), which vary from country to country, especially in regards to capital gains.  (Is there a minimum time to keep those assets?  What would be the most fiscally sound scenarios for you, depending on different possible/probably events? etc.)
I believe that person might give better advice than anonymous reddit hodlers.  :P
That being said, I am sure you already know the general rule of thumb about capital gains.  And tax is to be paid on gains, that is, any time a "taxable event" happens, which is at selling any asset that you own. An accountant or fiscalist might help with the more subtle details.
As far as banks goes, I believe this shouldn't be much of a difficulty.  Again, with that net worth, you very probably have some established banking relationships and a good credit history.  Or, said differently: you are probably not a guy arriving out of nowhere at a random bank with a suitcase full of 100 dollar/pounds bills!  So you probably aren't doing anything weird, and I wouldn't start doing so either (e.g. opening a new bank account to an institution where you haven't dealt with, and moving half a million dollar through it within the first few days...)
I have heard numerous times that Bitstamp is good and reliable, especially for larger transfers (which can be SEPA transfers).
Hope this can help.

Great work!  Laughed a lot.
But, seriously:  History is written by the winners, as you know...  ;)

I fully feel your pain and disappointment regarding that.
That's why I personally think (despite the risk of being downvoted here!) that the future lies in using a coin like Litecoin for those smaller transactions.  Block time is 4 times faster (2.5 minutes, there is no capacity shortage, fees as still very reasonable - and segwit even got locked in, and will be activated within 1-2 weeks.
Without entering into useless debates, I personally prefer Litecoin because it is simple, close to Bitcoin, solid, etc.  There's no extra stuff like Ethereum (which I understand fits better for smart contracts and other more complicated stuff than for small purchases) and others.
I believe Bitcoin, in its current state, fits best for much larger transactions (e.g. $5K, or buying a car, or a house), than for buying a coffee.  I don't mind waiting 1 hour for confirmation that the money transfer for my house was securely made - it's still faster, cheaper and more secure than through a bank.
I really mind waiting 10 or 20 minutes to get a coffee.  It's cold by then.  :(

I wish Bitcoin will get segwit and LN "within the next year" - meanwhile, that doesn't solve our current issue with fees, speed, usability - and cold coffee.  Litecoin already offers that, just right now.  *And* it will get a 100x capacity increase with LN pretty soon, I would suppose.  There already is a good consensus within that network.  (Well, anything compared to the state of Bitcoin's consensus can be called "good"  ;)  )

May 27th, 2017.  (GMT)
(I would actually have chosen May 28th, but someone else already did choose.  So the $2000 mark will come earlier, then.  :P  )

Great work!
Looking at the changelog, I see there is a lot of work in what you've done.
You deserve respect and appreciation!

And it then posted that here on Reddit, so that people began to think it was true, and it then became the reality...

Sorry - my time machine had a glitch, and it did affect Huobi's API too.
That's just future data, don't worry about that now.

Wow, impressive!  Congrats!

They should have gone long starting from 6 months ago.  At 100X leverage, they wouldn't have needed to put those ads, then.  ;)

Very sad to see that.  Ads have no place in a wallet software.  (Neither inside my own fridge or in my own shower! )
I hope the devs can recognize that it was a wrong course of action, and revert back rapidly before more damage to the reputation of Mycelium is done.

Sad (or should I instead say "ironic") that this content is delivered by default on http and not https.  And even more so that coindesk.com redirects to http is you try to force https.

There was a guy whom posted an impressive (Bitcoin) coin collection here recently:  
He might have more information for you.

Good move.
It's a positive sign when people recognize they have made a mistake and make amends.
