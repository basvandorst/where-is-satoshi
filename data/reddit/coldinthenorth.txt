Well said

Completely agree.  Mike Maloney is doing a great service to everyone with these videos.  Even he admits it’s impossible to time things accurately.  I learnt so much from this series I can’t believe people are bashing it as trash

Ask them who owns the Bank of Canada. I’ve always wanted to know.

Holy FUD, Batman!  Most biased article I’ve seen in a while.

I thought I’d might be a reference to the rat currency from the Cosmopolis movie

Agreed! Is it available as a desktop wallpaper?

A sat is a satoshi.  It is the “penny” of a bitcoin.  There are 100 million sats per btc.

Beautiful design!

Nice article.  Thanks for posting.  It makes another strong argument for sound money.  Bitcoin and gold both serve this purpose.

I’ve been to Plovdiv many times!  Where is the ATM located in the city?

I think you are right,  USD is inflating itself into disaster.  Fiat is coming to an end.  Hard to predict what will happen, but a return to traditional ways of storing money will certainly be considered.  A crypto/precious metal combination could prove to be one of the greatest advancements of our lifetimes.  An egalitarian global currency without censorship based on the laws of mathematics instead of the whims of the powerful.  A merger between metals and bitcoin seems almost natural.  
Care for a date in your prediction?

Ndax.io works great.   Had to use regular interac etransfer, so it will take you many weeks to buy that much BTC.
Also had some success with shakepay, but I had to keep calling my bank (RBC) every time they blocked the transfer.  Always went through, however.  The verification got a bit too personal, imho.

No problem.  There are no limits about who, or even what, can own bitcoin.  As long as you control a key pair, the money is yours.  There is no central authority to get permission from.  A dog can own crypto.

Looks great.  Love silver

Traditional markets are looking weak, and the slightest move to bitcoin has a big influence on its price.  We are still at the very beginning of what may be a new form of money accepted by large segments of the human population.  Much of it is outside the USA.  Volatile actions on bitcoin trade can arise from any group of people anywhere and thus means we may never know every aspect of the bitcoin story.
Tl;dr who knows

All that is needed is 51% hash power to corrupt the entire chain.  This was clearly explained in the Satoshi white paper.

The fall of fiat will be harder and no one will know why for that too.  Read a few books if you are curious.

Looks great
