If you buy the cryptosteel from buytrezor, you get to store 24 words which is generally the case with trezor.

HW1 is made up if plastic while the ledger nano has a aluminium case sort of a thing which makes it look good.
When it  comes to functionality, the HW1 and the ledger nano are equal. The only difference is the physical form.
Read this for more info:[Ledger nano, HW1 and unplugged - overview]( 
If you want to spend less money, go for HW1. If you have some extra cash and would like a good looking hardware wallet, go for the nano.

Bitcoin is just like the internet in its nascent stages. It has a small user base. Hence,100 milliom transactions is a laudable achievement.

They clearly state that bitcoin mined is more valuable that bitcoin bought

Lol at the last paragraph of the article - quoting the Oxford English dictionary.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:05:50
I'm pretty sure its going to be greater than 3 million. 
1. Lots and lots of media coverage is going to attract quite a few people.
2. Less than 1 million would not be a very good reason for VC's to invest &gt;900m in bitcoin startups.
3. Overstock, dell and other major companies wouldn't accept bitcoin to facilitate &lt;1 million users.
4. Blockchain.info has 5.4 million wallets and it is very unlikely that everyone will have &gt;1 wallets.
5. Coinbase doesn't support many countries where bitcoin is thriving. An example would be India where it has been estimated that ~30k users own BTC(30k is not much but if you have a look at other countries and add them up, it will be a substantially large number)and coinbase doesn't support India. They just support 32 out of ~190-200 countries that we have right now.

First things first, secure your bitcoins. Get a hardware wallet. Trezor is extremely good but it costs $99.
Ledger, on the other hand has the cheapest and the best hardware wallets. 
An overview of their products can be found in the link below. They've raised €1.3 million and the products are affordable enough. Make sure you setup your device with a ledger starter(costs €5.5).

2. Blocksize debate(reach consensus?)
3. CFTC wants to regulate stuff.
4. Lightning network!
5. SegWit
6. 21 bitcoin computer is just tooo awesome. Let's hope they release cheaper chips this year.
7. Cryptsy announced their 13k BT and 300k ltc loss(outstanding dues might be lower) in addition to a 1k BTC bounty.
8. Blockchain.info testing their alpha wallet since last year, will they move into beta?
9. Robocoin shuts down business.
10. Chain.com pivots from a API service.
11. Ledger going to release their ledger blue which can also act as pgp key storage, fido U2F, 2FA etc.(production launch probably in Q2 )
12. I'm pretty sure quite a few companies will shut down.

I own a trezor as well as a ledger nano and ledger HW1.
Yes, $100 is a bit too steep for beginners but considering the fact that you're going to be involved with bitcoin for a substantial amount of time(or forever) I think a hardware wallet is a must. Ledger has done an excellent job at reducing the barrier for entry by selling hardware wallets for just €15 which, typically speaking, anyone can afford. In addition to this, trezor and ledger have multisignature support which needs up security.
Here is [an overview of ledger's hardware wallets]( 
Personally, storing bitcoins on blockchain.info, coinbase, etc is a huge risk due to many reasons which have already been cited. 
Ultimately, it boils down to the private key, which hardware wallets store securely.
TLDR: If you're in for the long run, hardware wallets are something you should invest in.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:57:51

It's the same principle good applied early on - "comply or die" the only difference being that webmasters didn't have s rulebook to comply to but it eventually popped up in the form of "SEO" blogs, services, tutorials, experiments and case studies.
Its important to note that Brave.com doesn't remove all the ads. It only removes the ones who invade your privacy, decrease page load in time due to unnecessary stuff, malicious code etc.
Overall, they want to increase page load time + remove pesky and and trackers + compensate users and build a micropayment economy for websites to make money from.

Try to get to the root of crypto. Understand the paradigm shift from first principles.
I'd say read more about how the space has evolved since 2015, and what has changed. More importantly, a lot of things haven't worked out in the space. Try to find out accurate reasoning as to why they havent worked out.
In short: Explore, and try to write, talk and discuss with other crypto users.
You'll build your network, and get a grip over what you want to do. At hedge funds, you'd need to be able to trade(and know crypto markets in and out)
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:19:08

TLDR: If you've got some stash which you're holding, hardware wallets are something you should invest in. Buy a ledger duo or a HW1 multisig pack along with the ledger starter, setup a multisig wallet. It is extremely secure.
Edit: Trezor is a good option as well. But it costs $100. If you setup your ledger safely, you will have pretty much the same disability and features as that of trezor except the screen.
@_date: 2016-02-08 02:47:35
That's 11% and it stinks. The whole reason to use bitcoin for remittance was due to the low fees, as opposed to the 6-19% that is generally charged.
@_date: 2016-02-16 17:04:09
I agree that trezor is pretty good. However, ledger had a minimal and much more portable form factor in addition to slick apps. 
The price, in my opinion, is the biggest plus point. If hardware wallets are dirt cheap(€15), I say that everyone should try using them rather than those pesky online wallets.
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:27:05
Mycelium + trezor with an OTG cable is good. However, ledger seems to be quite slick with the dedicated mobile application, 1.3 million in investment and stuff. It's form factor is quite beneficial as well.
