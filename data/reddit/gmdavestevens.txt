Oh, I was thinking an "all things being equal" scenario, where there would have been a 50/50. It does seem as though whomever takes the bet has more to loose.  The most that they can win is $500 but they can lose much much more.  The most the better can lose is $500, where the most they can win is much higher, I think that this would throw off most normal betting odds.

So, if the value does go up that far, you win &gt;$500 but if it doesn't go up that far, you loose &lt;$500? Seems like a bet that nobody would take.  There is probably some sort of mathematical term for this type of bet.

I think the point is that Coinbase uses an internal ledger to pay Overstock if you pay from a Coinbase wallet, negating any transaction fees or confirmation wait times.

Make sure that you send ALL of the funds from that paper wallet to a new address before you spend some of it.  Do a search for "paper wallet change address".  Possibly add 'follies' or 'woes' to the end of that search. 
If you need it back on a paper wallet, print out a new one.

Grumpycoin is automatically given to people that make negative comments on the internet.  What you are actually doing while mining is brute forcing the addresses for all of the negative comments you've ever made. Once found, you can give amounts to any other Negative Nancy on the line.

So you aren't REALLY accepting VISA/Mastercard, since you change them into dollars instantly, seems sort of superfluous and unnecessary.

If you just want a few millis, the easiest way would be to hit up some faucets.  It took about 2 days of mundane link clicking once in a while (I mean, I was already on the internet) and I got .5 mBTC so I could get my proverbial feet wet.  IMO it was much easier to do that then to mess around with trying to mine. I would post the links but I think that is against the rules.
