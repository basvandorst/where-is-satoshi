Sweden charged 2% instead of 0.1 plus it was a totally different age. Don't be fooled by demagogues. Transaction tax is already implemented in a number of countries with success. One of those is France neighbour Belgium, where I live.
Financial transaction tax is not oppression, it is liberating!

I am all with you concerning reducing the privileges of the financial system but making strong demands in the void won't make a difference. That is why I give more voice to demands that have already gained some popularity. I am not sure I understand all that you are saying, my native language is dutch.

You are demanding empirical data and lots of bla bla bla but I don't see you proving anything here.
Honestly for me this is not about how the specifics of trading and efficiency are organised but more about how we get to tax these huge profits made by corporations in the financial world. Get a break from the ever increasing demands to strip us from our social protection. 
If it is also usable as a means the curb excessive speculation it might be a good thing.
In Belgium statutory pensions are paid by taxes. I think it is a foolish idea to give such matters in the hands of private corporations that use it for trading. Savings for pensions should be very prudent and guaranteed by the state.

How? Do you own the the world and the governments?
I do not want to kill off all financial capital but its interest should not be above other peoples interests. 
I take a pragmatic approach and applaud the measures that bring more freedom and wealth to the population at large.

I don't know if HFT hurts or others but I guess the European government has consulted their best men. It seems common sense to me that speculators add little value to the chain. I am ok with a bit taxation in a sector that makes huge profits and pays almost nothing back to the society that enables it. Certainly if it might help us save from cutting in public education and other things that are more important to humans.

Less power in the hands of the ultra-rich. Politicians are at least elected dictators, bankers and speculators not.

Tax has nothing to do with revenge. It has to do with sharing the costs of running a society.
