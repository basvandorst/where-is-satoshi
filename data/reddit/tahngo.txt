What does that have to do with the currency being taken seriously?  Right now it's just a fad.  We don't know what's going to happen, and that's a big problem in creating legitimacy

Because we live in the future.   We can have flying cars, but we can't have a stable currency.   Who do we point the finger at and blame?

Wanna make a wager it never does?
