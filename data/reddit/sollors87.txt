Hey hodlers... Venezuela is implementing its own crypto called Petro. It's a erc20 which ICO will be held on February 20... this is supposed to be the first cripto supported by a government and it will try to tackle serious economy problems like hyperinflation, cash shortages, etc... We are going to be way ahead of btc if this works ;-)

 Ojalá tengas la razón, el régimen es el principal ganador si les sale bien... pero no depende de nosotros, solo el tiempo dirá.

Not at all. Maduro could flee to Cuba, that's good for him, and good for us in Venezuela... But sure, they could have a lot of money from Petro meaning more starving and shit for our ppl...

The battle of BOTS has begun for the 11250$ mark. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:01:26
What a massive dump, stupid bots, we want to believe!
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:54:09
Take a look at bitcointicker.io how fast automated bots place sell orders around 11250$, this is not letting the price go up above that price.

WP says they won't be able to release more tokens. So final qty will be 100.000.000 petros.
