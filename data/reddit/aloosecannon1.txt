Ask him to send you a screen shot of view transaction. Don’t get scammed many guys try to scam cam girls like this. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 09:59:16
You can check the logistics of the transfer by checking the block explorer. Bitcoin will need 6/6 confirmations before its sent. Ask him for the block explorer then google any bitcoin block explorer and type it in. It’ll give you the status of it.

Lol. Hope you have a back up. Cuz they might just end up stealing ur pencil holder. Why make it yellow make it something that won’t stand out as much. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:14:23
Yes you can predict. And instead of complaining why don’t you get an education so you can understand the current stat of bitcoin. Surprises me how self proclaimed smart people are always the dumbest. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:17:34

@_date: 2019-03-27 03:08:39
Classic ego battle between the season TA analyst and BTC shiller. 
Good luck ����

What “experts” why not isntead of childish comments why don’t you share your TA. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:18:42
Naw. Not picking fights. Just being 100% real. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 07:03:15
Not mad. Just a realist buddy. Been trading for over 20 years lol. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 08:19:07
Throw it away. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:00:45
Picking fights from being brutally honest?  
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:51:52

@_date: 2019-03-24 09:55:38
I should sell out..?  Rigjt. Thanks for the pro TA :) tisk tisk. Bitcoin shillers 
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:30:17
Lol. My point is that people believe that bitcoins going to hit 50k this year. But in reality the near market is no where near done. This bear sealn May last for another 2-3 years. :)
@_date: 2019-03-25 05:19:08
I apologize. Can I have the link to this plz. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:16:20
Who gives a fuck

@_date: 2018-07-29 18:23:30
Yeha this is not a real TA 
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:54:23
There is rules and laws to TA....  look I know you’re probably knew and fascinated with crypto and the the chance of making money fast and quick but I can assure this isn’t TA.. you will understand in a few years as of why this is invalid and a proper method to analyze momentum what so ever. Anyways have fun with trying every drawing feature and indicator incorrectly but If you’re truly interested in how price action works I would suggest to start by going on babypips.org. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:04:21
 Pitchfork rules ]( 
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:26:37
 here is an example of a REAL TA. Inverse head and shoulder bull continuation pattern confirmed by RSI and bullish action on a 20,60,120,30 ichimoku settings.  [XBT/USD INVERSE HEAD AND SHOULDERS]( 
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:36:59
Dude you’re using the pitchfork wrong. And this isn’t a real TA
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:23:19
TA isn’t for suckers it’s for the best.  Market makers go by TA hence why people short markets 100X when critical resistance is broken. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:01:12
I know what wd gann angles are and this isn’t how you use. You use the pitchfork to measure 3 points. Support base and resistance.........  keep studying it’ll makes sense 
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:21:50
LOL AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. Such a troll 
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:07:06
Hell no. I’d spend it on cam or
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:27:31
Yes exactly.  RESISTANCE ]( 
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:50:04
By price rising. Volume most importantly. Buy volume  is what we need. We need everyone to get back on board but as of now. I still think volume is relatively weak compared to real bull market volume with institutional banks being involved.  �� 
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:29:02
The pink/purple line is the current RSI price and as you can see the price has been topping out at lower peaks. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:14:08
[rsi resistance. ](  I drew a line on the RSI indicator showing the resistance line representing price rejection. If the price of bitcoin breaks through these resistance levels identified through the RSI price will have no problem making new highs up to $10,000
