This civil war is not about the blocksize. It's about power:
Who controls the development of Bitcoin?
There will be much more changes in the future necessary to keep Bitcoin the leading crypto. Who decides when and what to change. Once we figure this out, raising the blocksize is just a small bump in the road.

Bitcoin is growing up! This is a good thing. Bitcoin is getting more serious. For some people who are in it for just the fun this is boring. Dogecoin is fun, but it started as a joke. You probably can make some money and have fun a long the way but at the end of the day it's still a funny bitcoin clone and won't change the world.

I had the same problem. Your Electrum server needs to logon to IRC channel  
Try the command
electrum-server peers
If you only get [ ] you are not connected to IRC. You can also login to IRC to check. Go to  and login to channel  The servers are logged in as the user E_nickname. Make sure you nickname in /etc/electrum.conf is very short. Mine had to be only 2 characters.
Check what version of the Python module IRC you have. If you have version 11.0.1 (default in Ubuntu 14.04) you have to change the file ircthread.py. Goto line 116 and change 'irc.client.IRC()' in 'irc.client.Reactor()'
If you use the IRC module 10.0 use 'irc.client.Manifold()'
Have a look at my conversation with the developers:
Good luck!

Electrum doesnt download the blockchain, so you save a lot of time and diskspace. And you can write down the 12 words  and delete your wallet. That's easy cold storage.
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:37:00
Quick answer: electrum
@_date: 2014-12-22 07:21:00
Without password and seed you have a real problem. 
If you setup a new wallet with electrum you get the 12 word seed and then it asks you to type it in again. That's the only way you can get to the next step of setting up a new wallet. After that step you need to type in your password. If you didn't get all of this, you probably don't run a real version of Electrum or you suffer from amnesia.

Electrum is easy and you can use it right away (no downloading the blockchain).

Also if you have 0.5 Mbps upload you can use a wallet like Electrum. But if you are really want to go hardcore with a full client/node, just rent a VPS for $10 a month. Most of these have very fast upload. You don't even have to invest in local hardware. A Raspberry Pi with SSH connection and the monthly rent of a VPS is cheaper than the average notebook. This is 2016, act like it!

Assuming that people who are pro Bitcoin Classic are trying to destroy Bitcoin is not an observation. It's a statement.
I am pro bigger blocks and if that's in Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic doesn't matter to me. At the moment only Bitcoin Classic is going to 2 MB, so that makes me pro Classis. It think this will not destroy Bitcoin, but will help it to grow.

I fail to see where i made a statement that Bitcoin will replace banks any time soon? I'm very pro-Bitcoin, but if Bitcoin doesn't seem to be able to improve there will be no future for Bitcoin i'm afraid. All i'm saying: We need to move forwards. Standing still is moving backwards. Other crypto's will come... So lets be mature about the future of Bitcoin and not only try to get our own way, not only our own solution. Come together. Find common ground. Make compromises! It's scaling now, but in a couple of years there will be new challenges. Bitcoin needs to grow and adapt and grow and adapt etc over the years to come to stay relevant. Let's prove we can do this! Be one Bitcoin community again!

Doing both maybe makes no sense technically, but it does politically. Make no mistake about it, we won't find a technical solution to fit both sides. Segwit will not make it to the required percentage and BU won't either. So there must be a compromise. This is the only way we can move forward. Take a little loss and a little win for both camps.

It looks like a compromise is the only way out of this civil war. Segwit or the HF will both never happen on their own without a compromise. So doing both segwit and raising the blocksize limit at the same time, seems inevitable at some point. Hopefully sooner than later. But probably later.

Before the closure of banks, some Greeks rushed to buy Bitcoins. Increasing investors has reached such a point that transactions increased from 120,000 per day, ie 10 times more compared to 2011 as noted by Coindesk.
This has generated a certain destabilization of the system last weekend suffered problems to process transactions, taking up to five hours in making of payments. This also affected the new stakeholders who were unable to create their accounts.
"I do not know what's going on here, because Bitcoin has never been bigger," says Gil Luria to Business Insider.
Despite this overload the system has been able to continue to grow, increasing its strength. According to Bloomberg the delay was due to a software update for PC payment system.
While these problems have been solved, the question is whether the virtual money will eventually replace the role and im give some hope to the Greeks who have relied on the use of Bitcoin.
