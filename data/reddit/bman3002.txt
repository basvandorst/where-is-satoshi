Don’t think so. They have they different views and want different outcomes.

Nah I didn’t put my money in it to make a quick buck. That’s how you lose you money. I’ve been in the same coins for over a year if you call that quick yeah I guess I’ve made a quick buck. I’m in this thing for the long run. My issue is that people come into this thing speculating and then when they lose they want to cry about it. Had they done some tease arch instead of listening to cousin Bob they would not have taken a second mortgage.

No complains. Gives me more time to buy more

And the people that are losing their asses are those that came into the market hoping to make a quick buck. Do I feel sorry for them? Yeah a little but those are the risks you take when you speculate into a new market

No one knows what the end result will be. If anyone tells you that they do they are lying. If you believe in the tech buy if not sell and get out.... I’m all about buying right now
