Frighteningly accurate

3k? Did you pick that number out of your ass? Or are you hoping to buy back cheap? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:38:34
Why are there so many pessimistic, overly bearish people here. If you honestly believe bitcoin is fucked and going to dump to some horrible depth. Then GTFO and live your life.
I can't work out if there's cunning people trying to spread negativity and fear because they want to buy back cheaper, or they're just retards.

This will make me rich and so I believe it to be 100% accurate 
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:24:27
Jack buying $10k a week fits my narrative. I believe he is doing that, and I'm going to get rich.

Imagine instantly validating an observation.
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:46:01
Imagine spending your life hating bitcoin and posting negative comments about it.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:40:49
Nope do try and keep up. The NYAG even confirmed they had reserves.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:19:48
Yes they (Ifinex) did provide proof of reserves. They have something like 80% backed by usd and the rest by other assets.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:46:19
You are clearly bias and unable to follow matters. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:18:54
Scam. Lookup mass network and swish for further scams they ran. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:36:47
$60k by 2022? you pessimistic fool.
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:04:25
This aged well
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:14:13
Bitcoin will be responsible for a significant increase in pollution/emissions. Just think of all those extra lambos which will be about when BTC hits $100k.
@_date: 2019-10-20 14:33:20
You won't buy a crumb below that price range
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:23:25
Is there anybody left on crypto reddit who isn't 'OMG so outraged' over bullish posts? The salt must be stinging your eyes. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:17:42
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:12:09
Lol you fucking clown, you said 5k before 10k.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:13:15
Can't wait for the shit posters to get triggered by another person on the Internet being positive. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:32:45
No they'd buy OTC, meanwhile open huge shorts on the market to simultaneously drive the market price down. Oh wait that was 2018. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:29:20
They must have finished their accumulation. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:16:01
It's totally dependent on the depth of your pockets

... says the guy borrowing money from his mum. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:47:14
Calls someone a "retard". Then sends his time on a subreddit devoted to a topic he knows nothing about nor has any interest in. What a joke. Say hello to mummy. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:22:23
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:20:12
The OP was talking about billionaires. So there's your reference point. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:24:35
Bahahaha. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 12:09:31
Congrats to you guys. Smart ambitious people actually getting off their backside to try and achieve something. The opposite of some of the lazy fudding reddit posters who just come here to criticise from the safety of a keyboard.

Zero is a guarantee with the heat death of the universe.

If true it certainly puts two fingers upto the naysayers who believe institutional money is not entering the market. NOTE deposits are rumored to be insured. So if you have many millions worth or are not technically savvy. This service makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:51:16
My only thought on this matter. The ICE are huge players and they wouldn't have launched this if they didn't know there is big demand. Yet I'm already reading FUD articles that there's 0 take-up from Institutions. Give this thing 12 months, then let's judge.
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:23:57
Here's all I know. Banks prefer traceable transactions especially from businesses. I no longer use LBC and only use established exchanges (Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken etc) for fiat ramps. The peace of mind is worth it.
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:48:00
There's plenty to suggest the bear market is coming to a close. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:56:25
They were probably all buying cheap bitcoin, preying on weak hands who fell for their FUD.
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:30:30
Buying steroids on the Internet sounds like a solid life plan. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:52:44
Goodbye my delicate flower. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:20:21
Sorry I can't be there, I'm already in the $50k waiting room.
