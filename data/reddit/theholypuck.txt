I bet he remembers greenbacks... 
There is literally no relevance here.

Agree. Making money is great, but there are other reasons to be involved.

I'm starting to look at BCH alot, and I am kinda getting the feeling it might trend in that direction. 
Everything is unsure right now. Very weird time in crypto for sure. 
edit: not looking to start a war just my thoughts/ also I unfortunately do not own any BCH.

I know Coinbase can be instant with a credit/Debit Card. 
Using an ACH will inherently take 4-5 days to clear (think old school check clearing) 
Upload money in Coinbase use GDAX limit order seems to be very popular because = no fee. 
More info can be found on youtube.

Wouldn't Ethereum be a better buy as it pertains to blockchain investing or am I wrong?

This is way more of a rant/hate video then anything else, and its actually super annoying. 
People aren't watching because its painful to watch.
I'm done with this thread, and your terrible attitude.

I have the same issue. I have been watching for while but just recently had the funds to purchase. Now I'm wishing I had jumped in a lot earlier.

hopefully be able to actually use it at more retailers, eliminating some need for FIAT there, thus eliminating more uses for FIAT in general.

I feel it would be foolish of you to write it off. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:08:36
AGREED. Thank you.

This is really cool, and I really hope its true. Good Luck in the future.

It's not disproved of, I agree with you, but there is better ways to approach your opinions (IMO). Blockchain is what should be focused on more.
