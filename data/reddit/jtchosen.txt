Yeah i agree with you. We learned that states essentially try to maintain a low rate of inflation. If it get's too high the economy will suffer negative consequences and a low amount of inflation is better than a low amount of deflation.

Isn't Bitcoin perfect for shady rich people who want to hide their transactions? I don't understand why everyone describes Bitcoin as the currency for the small men who doesn't want to be supressed by banks. Less regulations-&gt;Getting raped by rich greedy people???
Please explain

Implying bitcoin is the coming www. I am quite sure that digital currencys will be a big thing, but i am not confident that the mass adoption will come in the form of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 00:36:23
You can look at the Equation of exchange. 
When V and Q are constant, the price level increases at the same amount the nominal amount of money increases.  dP/P=dM/M
If you look at the english Wikipedia article of inflation you can even see a helpful graph 
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:55:22
At least they are no banks.

In germany the rich people are libertarians and the lower middle class and lower class people are for a big state. How can this be the other way round in USA??? O_o
@_date: 2014-08-22 15:21:07
The supply may go down but if the demand goes down aswell, the price stays constant. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:06:19
Would you have said the same thing one year ago? I guess yes. Seems like you understand the nature of bitcoin and would have lost 50% of your money. Good point.
I'm doing my masters which is 30% economics, I'm not completely brainead man. Sure you can make big profits with bitcoin but those come with a huge risk. You don't just eliminate all risk because you "understand the technolocy" and "get it".
@_date: 2014-10-02 02:12:43
I don't really understand what you mean. A government does not inherently inflate the money supply. Depending on a loooot of factors they have to adjust their monetary policy. And this exact opposite you mention is just a restrictive monetary policy, that aims to decrease inflation. That is used all around the world. Or maybe you meant something else I'm not really sure. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:59:16
I read this often in this sub. But why does Bitcoin has the breakthrough and not the new Internetcurrency that is developed in Silicon Valley and will be released in a a few months? 
How can you be so certain, that it will be exactly Bitcoin, nothing else?

I am not really sure if you are serious, but i can't agree with most of your points.

Imagine you are russian. Your currency is dropping rapidly. And then you decide to put your savings in a highly volatile currency, the "money of the internet" that lost even more value in 2014 than your own currency? That would NOT be a rational decision.

You can do many things with the Internet, that are more impactful than sharing a picture. I don't really agree with that comparison.

I am pretty sure, that it is not as easy as "i will follow this certain scheme and after 10 years im rich as Fuck ". He maybe has certain base values, but the decisions have to be made case by case. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:15:17
This exact scenario doesn't have to be true. But this is the reason why i can't understand, why low regulation are good for the average person. These regulations are in place for a reason. If they don't exist the big players can buttrape you so hard, that you can't do anything. They can manipulate, insider trade and do whatever they want, as a guy who holds 2 BTC you don't know shit and will eventually lose your money. Add to that some nice algos from very very smart people and you are completely helpless. 
But im FREE!!! lol
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:57:00
Why does everyone say, that low regulation is bad for the rich people and institutions? If you hold a lot of bitcoin you can communicate with your rich friends and influence the market etc. etc.?
In germany most rich people are for less regulation (FDP/CDU), the normal/poor people want more regulation, taxes etc and vote for SPD. Isn't that the same?
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:29:43
I always read about deflation in regards to bitcoin, but isn't it super inflationary? I took 3 macroeconomics courses, so I'm not really an expert, but some pretty basic stuff is, that if the amount of money(don't know how you call it in english) increases, the money becomes "cheaper" because the supply is higher than the demand. =&gt; currency devalues. Mining increases the amount of money ALL the time, just like a central bank when it prints money, or not? How is it then a good store of value ? ( i read that quite often) Please explain
@_date: 2014-10-02 03:17:08
Yeah that's true, but what is the alternative? Not print any money? What do you do in a deflation then? Let everyone lose their job, let the economy collapse and let the population kill each other?
@_date: 2014-08-11 05:09:15

@_date: 2014-07-25 11:12:41
You wan't an unregulated system as a private Investor? I mean i don't know if you are a multimillionaire but as a small private investor i would definitely want regulation? Can someone explain this to me?
In general the rich want less regulation and the normal people want more right?
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:39:36
Then the answer is probably, that your assumptions are wrong.
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:57:39
Is the system different than in germany? Here you can send money to any bank, you just need the IBAN of the other person. Can people in the US only transfer to the people from the same bank? That would be really stupid :-o
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:13:24
Does a trezor really cost 120 $? To break even i would need a 120 $ return from my bitcoins.  That's not a really good deal?
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:12:38
Some people like to discuss an interesting technology while still using their brain and thinking critically. Sounds foreign to you, right?
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:06:20
Didn't hear of that effect yet. Just looked it up, yes it makes sense. Like i said, that's one of the problems of the models we use, they are still quite simple. But i don't see how this effect makes monetary policy completely useless. It may decrease the effectiveness or lead to not compleltely controllable consequences.

I think there are a bit more differences between the two. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:02:33
That's a good analogy imo. There is no definite sign, that bitcoin will be the preferred crypto currency in the future and not some altcoin, that is improved in certain, important aspects. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:05:58
Yeah they don't get it. Also the highly qualified engineers at Valve that worked for Microsoft or other high profile company can't understand how Bitcoin works. That is the only reason for not accepting bitcoin. Things like security, customers, implementation in running systems etc. can be ignored in a multimillion dollar company, because THERE IS NO DOWNSIDE to bitcoin. Otherwise they would have implemented it a loooong time ago right?
Do you even read what you write? Can you critically question your own view once in a time? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:50:21
So if it doesn't matter why would they choose Bitcoin over any other form of digital payment. Maybe there is a new startup in the sillicon valley that is centralized but has new features for higher security etc. etc. You have NO possible idea what the valve employees know about other/better payment systems that would maybe even give more potential users. 
And don't you think it takes a lot of time to implement hundreds of services that offer digital payment? They could stop developing games, if they accepted every service that could maybe give them a few more paying customers, because they would adjust their system full time to these new services. Maybe it is more expensive to integrate a bitcoin payment system into the whole steam platform than the profit that they can expect. I wont even talk about possible upcoming bitcoin laws that could influence their decision etc. etc.
=&gt;Maybe it would be a good idea to use bitcoin in the steam platform. But please don't act like this is a super straightforward decision because "You will receive USD on your end, so what do you care?". 
@_date: 2014-07-28 21:15:36
Isn't it in the interest of rich people to avoid taxes etc? You know that they can use bitcoin too, not only you?
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:00:45
Why would consumer debt not be a thing? 
@_date: 2014-10-02 03:18:42
How do you recover from a deflation then?
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:37:53
Yeah sure, if you are interested in the tech or bitcoin in general. But I am talking from an investment perspective. If i have to spend 100 dollars to keep my investment safe, if i even get a return, then it is not a good deal imo.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:27:19
Lol this is obviously a fake account. "Oh my god, how many "coins" are there?!" are u kidding me? :-D
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:07:32
Sure, something "Because we can't control bitcoin we won't use it anymore in germany and it is illegal to use". That could be a shock, that influences the investment behaviour.

You say that he shouldn't be here, if he doesn't think that the success of bitcoin is only a matter of time. I say, that you can still be here and discuss the technology, even if you don't 100% think that Bitcoin will be successful, because there are some problems with it. And you say, that there is no ciritcal thinking in this thread???? How is that a response to my post? So people who want to look at the pros and cons of bitcoin should only post in threads that contain ciritcal thinking? And you judge which posts do? That does not make sense to me.

A few years ago yes, but nowadays it is only needed in fast food restaurants like McD, Subway etc. If you go to a supermarket for example you can pay 1 € with card. I live in germany.

@_date: 2014-08-12 10:13:10
Is the money supply fix with bitcoin or can it be changed? We learned in macro 1, that it is sometimes needed to increase the money supply to decrease the interest rate so that more people lend money which leads to more investing (took it in german not sure if the words are right). It's been two years im not really sure if it was in cetain conditions, but this is a pretty basic approach in general i think? Would this be doable with bitcoin?

In germany most people use both quite equally. Nowadays you don't need a minimum amount, so you could just always use your debit card. I think bitcoin is a cool technology, but if you look at specific use-cases i fail to see how it can improve anything for the average joe.
I go to the store, tell the cashier i pay with card and I insert the card. I enter my 4 digits pin or sign with my signature and its processed within 1 second. Sometimes the procedure is faster than paying with cash. Why would i need bitcoin here? It's already fast, secure, easy and everywhere available.

You can send money via online banking. You have a username and a password. If you want to transfer some money to your friend they send you a generated TAN to your cellphone. You enter it and then the process is executed.
When you go to an ATM you insert your EC card, enter your PIN and get the Money. 
Theoretically you can get hacked, if they get your accountdata and hack your cellphone. But this doesn't seem to occur that often, at least i haven't heard of it.
