You're still missing my point. Sending to the Bitcoin network to, say, a hardware wallet, is covered if sending from GDAX. There is a fee, and you can see it in the blockchain explorer. 
GDAX covers the fees on the Bitcoin network.

Isn't this completely up to the exchange?  Can't the exchange send coins from a hot wallet using their own non-segwit addess?
I don't believe that the receiving address has anything to do with the sending address unless it is wallet software. Once you hit the exchange you pretty much have an IOU from them. You don't know where your coins are. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:52:10
$6 is still way too much, but you can't look at it as 6% -- he could send any amount for $6 as long as it was the same number of inputs / outputs.  You pay for space.

Assuming that you're in the USA..
When you sell the funds are in your "USD Wallet" or go directly to your bank.  If it's your USD wallet, you can then transfer from there to your bank.
There are weekly limits on this, so take that into account if you're going to be moving large sums of money.  Check what yours are here: 
Some are time based, some are based on the number of successful transactions, possibly even credit score based.

Looking at the insurance information, it looks like there is no difference between GDAX and Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:37
They're not.  People are speculating. Coinbase was not permitting BTC transfers for a short period of time while they moved BTC from cold storage to their hot wallet, IMO.
If anything, it shows that they're doing it right by keeping the bulk of their BTC offline.  They do have their head up their asses regarding segwit, though.

I don't suspect any nefarious action on behalf of the miners, but couldn't they play games by understanding how popular wallets estimate TX fees and flood the pool with low-fee transactions in order to trick wallets into using a higher fee than is really necessary?

Go to gdax.com -- you have an account if you have a coinbase account.  
Deposit into your BTC account from your Coinbase account the amount of BTC you wish to transfer.  There is no cost to this.  Just make sure to deposit from within gdax and do not attempt to send BTC from Coinbase, otherwise you'll have to pay a transaction fee.
Once this is done, click the Withdraw button, enter the destination BTC address, and send it.  There are no fees.

Your money is still on an exchange -- GDAX is just Coinbase's trading platform.  
When you create a wallet on your phone, you are given a (typically) 12 or 24 word mnemonic.  These words, in the order given, can be used to derive your private key.  If you flushed your phone down the toilet, these words can be used to recover everything.
Keep in mind that you don't ever actually have any bitcoin.  You have the keys to them and they only exist on the public ledger.
As for hardware wallets, I just received my Ledger Nano S and have been very happy with it.  Storing it on your phone is fine, but you risk having your coins moved to a different address (stolen) by potential malware on your phone.  I like to think of the hardware wallet as a savings account and my phone as a wallet.  I wouldn't walk around with thousands of dollars in my wallet, but would be fine with a hundred bucks in there.

@_date: 2017-11-22 16:52:20
I do not agree at all.
I am all about removing state-level regulation which hampers growth of community broadband and promotes ISP monopoly.  But I very much want rules in place to prevent ISPs from fucking me or businesses over.
Imagine that you are a VOIP provider and Comcast decides to shape your VOIP traffic because they have their own VOIP service.  The user has no other option because they have no other choice of ISP, so they're pretty much fucked.  You can have shitty phone calls or you can subscribe to Comcast VOIP services.  It's going to happen, whether it's Comcast Video On Demand vs Netflix or whatever business venture Comcast decides to move into next.
I want to pay for a certain data rate and I want them to leave my traffic the fuck alone.

Not quite.  It will ask you for a number, which will be the public key of your wallet.  Do this from GDAX to avoid the transaction fee.
If it's just $100, I'd leave it on Coinbase until you have time to read up on Bitcoin wallets.

I'm not arguing at all here, and you're still missing my point entirely.
I am saying that you shouldn't use telnet to check for TLS availability because it can give you a false negative.  Use something like "openssl s_client -connect $HOST:$PORT".
I'm not saying _anything_ about security practices or what should or shouldn't be done regarding accepting non TLS traffic on the Electrum servers.  I am saying that it is possible for a server to accept both TLS and plain traffic on the same port and that, by using telnet, you are testing with a client which would not initiate a TLS conversation.
If you're going to make a claim (and you're probably right about the TLS) about the lack of TLS, then you should make sure that you're testing appropriately.

Your miner fees will be higher this way when you send the coins to your personal wallet.  
Look at  and see how much the fee changes as you increase the number of inputs.

@_date: 2017-09-07 14:42:05
You could put the money into an exchange and buy BTC every 100-200 dollars.  That way you reduce the number of inputs/outputs in your transaction and can choose to buy when/if there is dip or when you feel like it.

Not really. 
From Coinbase's faq:
You will only receive B2X for the amount of bitcoin present in your account at the time of the fork. Pending BTC purchases at the time of the fork will not be granted any B2X.

Coinbase and GDAX are together -- if you have a Coinbase account you have a GDAX account.  Coinbase is a more user friendly interface, while GDAX is more advanced.  The Coinbase fees are higher than GDAX.
I was actually suggesting putting the money in a Coinbase "USD Wallet" so that the funds are immediately available to buy BTC.  You can deposit USD in Coinbase and use GDAX to buy BTC.  You can try it with $20 to understand how it works with little risk.
edit: an exchange is exactly what it sounds like.  They exchange one currency for the equivalent amount of another and charging a small fee.

My guess is Hal Finney.  I can be proven incorrect if Satoshi ever pipes up again in the future, though.

USD is FDIC insured. The crypto currency is privately insured, but not insured if your account is broken into.

A lot of people don't use it because the value fluctuates too much. How much did that pizza cost now?
People are used to inflationary things. A deflationary currency is strange.

I am utterly unfamiliar with the current Script, but could the number of bytes/tx be reduced in a transaction by simplifying Script?

I'm pretty sure that people there give gold to questions and comments they feel are "trolling" and then suggest that the gold comes from "core shills", and that you need to "follow the gold" to know who a troll is.
It's madness.

You will need a few GB of memory (I did it with 1, later moved it to 2GB to enable txindex=1) , and ~165GB hard drive space. Give yourself more hard drive space, though, because the chain is always growing.

Some proxy servers can inspect the traffic and continue without tls if the client is not using it. haproxy, for example, can do this.
