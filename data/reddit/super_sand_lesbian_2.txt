Murphy's law. The second you invest the market will go into free fall mode. Happens to all of us ��

Reminds me of the shower thought posted a while ago, "Everyone thinks they're a Rick, but really they're a Jerry"

Spent the whole movie at the edge of my seat waiting for some big curve ball plot twist. NOPE

Cool idea. Definitely a solid way to enlighten the public and fill that often awkward taxi ride small talk with some insightful information.

I purchased near the end of 2017 because I saw a .com boom 2.0 and didnt want to miss out; so I would be lying if I said I didn't get in because of the money/to make some money. That being said, I've definitely ridden some of the highs and lows and plan on being it in for the long term. I understand the tech at a basic level but truly feel it will be revolutionary. But again, I'm here to make money.
So here's my question, and please enlighten me. For those who claim they're here for the tech and not the money. WHY would you dump so much savings into something? Why can't you "support the tech" while safely protecting your savings and not investing, and purchase later if/when the tech becomes mainstream.
I don't understand the sentiment "I'm not here for the money... I'm here for the tech...". So let's say hypothetically, the tech becomes mainstream in 10years but the value doesn't appreciate (except for basic inflation), you're 100% fine with that?
EDIT: 


And I don't mean from premise of that being the risk you take on an investment, but if you were 100% certain the value would not appreciate, would you still invest in the tech?
