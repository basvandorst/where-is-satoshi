If you're in Auckland, the Dogs Bollix Bar has a Bitcoin ATM where you can buy BTC for cash, no verification needed.

Haha he deleted his post and comments.

I'm surprised they did this before Xero.
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:39:29
Exactly. What took half an hour or so on Bitcoin is the equivalent of taking a cheque down to the bank and waiting for it to clear, or waiting 90 days for a credit card transaction to be confirmed. It makes no sense to require transcation confirmations on point of sale systems. We need proper services like Coinbase to build great systems for consumers. I bought a beer with Bitcoin last night, and while my friend was waiting ages sending from his Blockchain wallet, I'd moved 0.03 into my Coinbase account earlier and that transcation went through in about a second.

If you ever want to be taken seriously you'll need to learn to proofread.

Not sure that's entirely fair.. LTB for sure have a ton of RSS/iTunes subscribers. Can't remember the last time I listened to one of their shows on YouTube, but they're one of my most listened to shows on my phone.

The price on mtgox is artificially high because of the difficulty of withdrawing USD. They are $100 above other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:00:57
Considering you need to be in the U.S. to use Coinbase and I just bought BTC from my New Zealand Visa Debit card... I'd say that yes, they are an order of magnitude better.

Hope they record the sessions

Yep, Visa, MasterCard etc are known as card schemes:

Oh yeah, I was just speaking in general. It's fine for smaller businesses but doesn't really work for most.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:45:53
The problem here is if you reply too quickly it turns from email into instant messaging- customers take instant action as a signal to respond right back for more. I read a post the other day saying that many companies specifically delay emails from being seen by anyone for an hour in order to reduce any potential follow ups. Another reason for this could be that a lot of people sort out whatever problem they have within an hour, and automating the system saves a lot of resources.

Centralised probably wasn't the right word. It only works between 21 devices and relies on the 21 mining pool.

It's a centralised lightning network

Some people take much longer and lose much more money over people they thought were their friends. It could be worse. Tell the cops as much as you can but you're unlikely to get anything back. Then find some better friends.

Why do you need a rig? Just buy coins.

Whatever you do, don't release BTC without the funds clearing
