the obvious one would be change your password.
But I would probably just withdraw the funds to a wallet on my local computer that i can trust more. then scrap the blockchain account and start a new one.

I've used it twice and had good experience too. dwolla -&gt; mtgox and cash -&gt; mtgox . both cleared pretty fast.

Its all my fault guys... on monday during my deposit i was telling the bank teller about how cool this is! :-/ shoulda never opened my mouth.
Also, I really liked localtill more than than the bitinstant/zipzap crap.
Anyone know any other exchange that also uses localtill???

~~well its not CC for BTC , it would be CC for mtgox USD, or usd on various other exchanges. But yeah, i get the sketch vibe too, but I cant seem to find any easy way to get usd into btc-e , and they "offer" that as an option. I might try a small amount that im willing to risk, just to try.~~
did some reading up on it. you're totally right, im staying away from it. it's too bad tho, i cant find an easy way to get usd into btc-e
