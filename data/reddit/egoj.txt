Yes Absolutely, 
Companies like Paypal take about 3% or a min 50c for each transaction so if you want to give $1 to a charity like kiva.org then all youve done really is give them 50c. like i said micro transactions are where it shines.
As far as HDD corruption and the like you have to take into account that Bitcoin is very much in its infant state as it develops there will be better management systems possibly even business that will insure your wallet security similar to a bank. 
However at this stage in time we as Bitcoiners have to maintain our own security which means only keeping small amounts of Bitcoin in Hot storage like a mobile phone and computer and keeping our bulk of it in Cold storage like a encypted paper wallet and ensure it is backed up.
Obviously there is no simple answer that says that Bitcoin is the golden bullet that replaces Credit cards. 
There are advantages on both sides and as Bitcoin evolves in ways that the traditional currency can't is when we will see it take over as the main form of payment in online transaction.

I reckon if your really after one wait until others get theirs and some will appear on ebay for sure.

What city are you operating out of?
Maybe you could visit one of the Aus Meetups
talk about your business
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:13:51
I think what people aren't realising are that there are people who don't trust their phone or computer for security of their bitcoins and well I wouldn't trust my bitcoin in an exchange or managed wallet. Though I know people who do. This would be a mechanism for those who want Bitcoin without the need for cold storage and the levels of security that we are familiar with. Hopefully insured by a business that is liable if the funds go missing.
I won't use it but im sure someone will.

In the case of online merchants the incentive for the consumer is lowered. For all the reasons you just stated With the exception of do you TRUST the merchant with your credit card info and do you want that info showing on your statement. However with Bitcoin the merchant pays much less in fees between 0 -1% as opposed to ~3% for credit card.
So! You can make small one time transactions to a site without providing them your information and be safe in the knowledge that they can't take more than what you send them.

I've only just started paying attention to the Trezor. Could you please explain how the private keys are generated / backed up in case you loose / damage your Trezor.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:05:05


I thought the concensus was that the brain wallet was a weaker form of private key generation. 
Thanks for the reply

I agree.  I'm big into bitcoin but I would not invest more than I can afford to loose as far as Bitcoin the currency is concerned. bitcoin as a protocol will becoming part of everything in one form or another.

Use this site to check the validity of bitcoin sites that are unknown 
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:24:23
So there are multiple exchanges in Australia Coinjar.io is the one I use and yes I am identified with them to do my transactions however there are more options for buying coins.
btcmarkets.net which is an open exchange (not sure of the KYC know your customer requirements)
bittradeaustralia.com Ive met the guys that run this site they are very nice though again I havent used their service.
They do Cash deposits across multiple banking services. however they have a 4.9% Buy fee. They calim to do the highest volume of trade in Australia however I cannot attest to this.
There is of course localbitcoins.com where you can buy directly from an individual however it is important to beware as your dealing with individuals and not a business so read through the localbitcoin information about protecting yourself.
If you live in sydney you can come to the Sydney Bitcoin meet ups and trade in person lots of traders there.

Taken directly from Wiki
A brainwallet passphrase, at a minimum, needs to be an entire original sentence that does not appear in any song or literature. Security is enhanced simply by including some sort of memorable personal information, which doesn't necessarily even have to be secret (e.g. an e-mail address, or phone number). A good brainwallet passphrase will have dozens of characters.
From talking with my mates simple answer is dont

Your website is suggesting that a share holders investment of $150 USD would provide a recurring monthly repayment of $140 a month if this were the case you would simply. Got to a bank take out a personal loan business loan new mortgage whatever and invest in yourself. Being bale to repay back that loan within 2 months.
If it looks to good to be true it probably is.

As with all financial advice you get from the internet your best to speak with your own accountant.
However I have been informed that with converting currencies from other currencies to AUD individuals are not taxed as it is too difficult to track this is not the case with Business' chaning large volumes

if you believe that people are giving you bad advice regarding mining. Then you should buy HOWEVER if they are giving you sound advice then you should listen to it... It could go either way however if you do some research yourself you can find out the truth.  provides a calculator for mining my maths is that given a perfect scenario over 1 hour you would earn on a 1350GH 1 hour contract for a cost of 93USD 0.03079291762894534257120862201694 BTC which at current exchange is about 27USD so from this I would say that the Bitcoin community is doing you a favour by suggesting that you should just buy bitcoin straight of course its your money to do with as you please

I found transfer very quick as it was done through both parties using the same bank. So Once the seller had verification of the transfer they released the BTC for me. took less than an 30min

I'm surprised no one suggested localbitcoins.com I found it easy to use. Though Im guessing the cost is higher

What stops Bit-Card recording all the private keys before they put their holographic sticker on it and taking dips into peoples paper wallets apart from poor business reviews and legal action. OR people claiming such.
Still a fantastic idea to get people into bit coin with a 100mB or so

Had decent experience with both Coinjar and Local Bitcoins so however you're dealing with multiple parties on Local so Coinjar might be the better system

You have answered your own question


If a block is being discovered in 5 minutes rather then teen then the difficulty will be adjusted quicker so we will see a difficulty jump in one week and not two and thus the overall rate of block discovery will slow down
@_date: 2013-09-28 23:02:15
This is poor rational.
No one is making you invest your money in Bitcoin stocks, gamble, mine or use a brain wallet. 
Also no one forces you to invest your Fiat currency in Bitcoin that is your choice.
Ultimately Bitcoin is not forced down anyone's throat and how an individual chooses to store their Bitcoin through a managed online wallet, an app, Bitcoin-QT client or on a hard wallet is their own choice and there is inherent risk. No where near the level that you're spouting.
By your logic I shouldn't put my cash in my wallet as every time I open my wallet there is a greater chance of mugging, the money flying out and accidental spending.
You are welcome to your opinions, however I feel as though they are skewed and jilted.
TL:DR No.
