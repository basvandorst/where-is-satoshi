Guess I'll make my predictions too.  
1) Exposure will mainly be from institutions going long and rolling the futures each month.  That is the only way for them to gain exposure to the gains in the cryptocurrency market overall via the rules of the funds they oversee.  
2) Or the futures will basically just die- there are plenty of low volume instruments on the CME site.   I doubt a massive short scenario will transpire.

Bitcoin belongs in the pink sheets as it is a vastly speculative buyer beware asset and the general public should need to make more conscious decisions when choosing to invest in something this speculative.  So far the hurdles to to open accounts and the large commissions and slippage charged serve this purpose.
If the SEC approved this and things went south, they would be liable in the public's eye for not protecting the public from an attractive nuisance.

Even if they are not held legally liable due to the Discretionary Function Exception for past mistakes, that is no excuse for them to not protect us from the future mishaps that could happen to potential 401K/IRA investors in bitcoin.  *Past performance is not a predictor of future results.*

They were held liable in the public's eye for Enron. I distinctly remember the SEC being excoriated for their oversight.  Let me see what I can dig up:
And WSJ article: 
Regarding Madoff, sure looks like the SEC was held liable in the public's eye too: 
But you conflating me saying "liable in the public's eye" with "legally liable" is not only incorrect, but a pretty dishonest and misleading way to pick apart an opinion you don't like via semantics.
