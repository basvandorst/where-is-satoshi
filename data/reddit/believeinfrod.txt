What a stupid article, full of misinformation.
"as their financial infrastructure and ecosystem are far from stable these days" - WTF? Mexico is not Argentina!
Regards the rest of the drivel - Volabit is not an exchange, it is a brokerage. Bitso is the largest exchange in the country by reported volume (albeit relatively small).

I think I'm going to scream. 20Mb limit != 20Mb blocks now
How long does it take blocks to get to 20Mb? How many years? How will Chinese Internet infrastructure evolve in that time do you think?

What's driving me crazy about this debate is that nobody seems to be getting that the change is to the block size LIMIT, not the block size NOW.
Setting the limit to 20Mb allows for headroom for transaction volume to gradually grow without hitting a wall. When will blocks reach 20Mb? Who knows; but probably in several years' time, giving more than enough time for all other factors to catch up (bandwidth etc).
It's just about raising the ceiling, not some kind of giant block Armageddon.
I would also argue that Bitcoin needs to be able to hard-fork, otherwise it has little chance of evolving adequately to meet the needs of the future. If hard forks are inevitable, why not test out the process now with this relatively innocuous change?

The answer is really very simple:
Take preorders for $X, make machines for $0.5X. Profit=100%, Risk=0%.
Oh, and if you need to run each machine for 'testing' purposes for a while, inadvertently generating a few bitcoins in the process? Well, that's just a bonus.
It all boils down to risk/reward. If they just invested in building the machines for themselves, they'd be taking a huge risk with no guaranteed reward. No sane investor would choose that option, given the choice.

Huge potential. I stumbled across this today: [bitso.com]( - Mexican Bitcoin exchange

It's a popular misconception that fractional reserve banking leads to inflation in the sense meant by the OP. It does create more money supply, but that money is counterbalanced by debt. Like matter and anti-matter, when the two are reunited (debt is repaid), they cancel out (which causes deflation in the same sense). In other words, the value of the money itself does not change as a result of this. What's really happening is that we are creating more tokens to represent real world objects of value. 
This is the fundamental nature of the debt-based money system we have. Though flawed, it's pretty clever actually.
I personally don't see an issue with fractional reserve banking being applied to Bitcoin, and it's most likely inevitable, if  Bitcoin is to succeed. Bitcoin would effectively become the equivalent to modern day cash in the broader money supply.

The site says:
'Important Reminder:  Due to the New Year holiday observed by Japanese financial institutions between December 29, 2013 and January 6, 2014, deposits and withdrawals are currently experiencing delays.  For withdrawals, your funds will be placed into your bank account once your transaction has been processed.
Please note that European transactions should not be affected by these delays.'
Perhaps they have a backlog. Or perhaps they're sunk.

As far as I can see, Satoshi's great insight and invention was the solution to the Two Generals problem. This was  the final piece of the jigsaw that had previously been missing. It allowed for a functional distributed time stamp database, which will be his great legacy. When you really understand the insight he had, you can't help but see genius in it.

A choice to switch to XT is a choice *not* to change Bitcoin's fundamentals. The change being made (via XT, as a last resort), is incredibly simple and non-disruptive. If a better idea came along later, there is plenty of time for it be implemented as an alternative - this is just about head-room. The arguments against this are so inscrutable that I can only assume there are some hidden agendas or otherwise people I once took to be smart are actually quite irrational.

It bugs me that people think 'blockchain' can have a life independent of bitcoin. Without Bitcoin as a monetary/value transfer system, the whole rest of the pack of cards falls down. No investment in genuine bitcoin infrastructure means no utility for Bitcoin, and thus no reason to enforce the network, and ultimately, then, all of the other bright ideas based around non-monetary blockchain apps will fail.
