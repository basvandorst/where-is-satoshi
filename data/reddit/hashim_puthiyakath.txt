 I'm a big fan of **Ecoinomi Wallet**.
It has many exclusive features like multiple sub-wallets.
We  can create multiple wallets in this app and organize our coins and  tokens very easily. Each wallet will have its own unique wallet address.
Moreover,  the wallet is very user-friendly. It shows the actual value of assets  in the wallet in USD. We can also convert the coins or tokens to other  tokens or coins very easily.

Ecoinomi is about to launch its **Ecoinomi Wallet** for iPhone users soon. The  beta version for  Android was a huge success. 
I would recommend you to follow the social media accounts if Eoinomi so you will know when the app is launched. Ecoinomi Wallet worth the wait. 
The Beta version of the Android app shows that Ecoinomi Wallet has many exclusive features. It supports a wide range of coins and tokens. 
Apart from that, it also allows us to create multiple wallets. It's really useful. The live chart for each coin is really useful.
Each wallet you created in Ecoinomi Wallet shows the real value of assets stored in that wallet in US Dollar.
