Why people talk about "hodling" so much? 
All I can think of is


@_date: 2018-01-23 02:16:18
Now you're ready to hold instead of "hodl".
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:56:25
Hanlon's Razor applies.
I don't think they're committing fraud, I think the recent crypto boom has completely overwhelmed them and they're collectively gasping for air as they try to meet the demands.
It sucks, but I think it's not malicious.

Informative, Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:38:55
Yeah... I bought near the 2013 peak, held for 3.5 years before it recovered.
They'll be ok if the hold.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:02:57
The one an hour ago.
30 hours ago?
40 hours ago?
There's so many to choose from!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:54:56
Oh, sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but someone misspelled "HOLD". You've a typo on your wallet.

Buy the trunk, sell the roots.

I'm on it

Of course not, DRM only ever makes things difficult for honest use.  iTunes made the music industry give up on DRM and obsoleted the idea of albums/records.  It didn't destroy the music industry, but it disrupted the record industry.
I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:32:37
Can they know who gets the fee?  Could they be actually trying to move money via fees, which would not be conventionally listed as the recipient of the transaction, that is, laundering?  Is that even worth doing?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:22:42
Or, Hedl, if you like misspelling.

I spent about $20k this year on healthcare *above* my insurance premiums.

Are you crazy?! That's how you create a recovery!!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:47:13
I put a buy order in at $9k.
That means it won't go down again. :/
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:34:52
It's a catch-22. The problem with BTC is people are using it. The strength of BCH is people aren't using it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:46:42
If it affects the price, you can make it up in trading.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:00:48
Napster lead to more DRM.
iTunes lead to DRM-free music.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:05:29
Not so much the banks as the vaults.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:14
MRW I see "HODL"
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:47:13
Nah, you have to push through the growing pain of that kind of communication and learn how to handle it. It gets better when it's less new.

A bit late. What's your scan cycle?

Just last week, this subreddit was bashing Coinbase for, among other things, taking a few days to approve users.

But, seriously, if the blocks went bigger, the fees would go down, right?  Then people would be more ready/willing to transact?  Then there'd be more transactions?  Then... The fees would go up again?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:38:23
Seriously this. BCH isn't over loaded because few people care to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:25:36
In USA's defense, that military budget allows USA's allies to have comfortably small military budgets.
You're welcome. ;)
Edit: but FU, American health insurance industry.

I'm not sure, but I think you may need to use the same app, depending on how it uses the pass phrase.
Always back up.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:13:47
Why? Because they're busy misspelling hold.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:39:50


@_date: 2017-12-22 20:31:06
Of course they don't have enough cash on hand. Banks don't. It's only a problem if people panic and make a run at them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:31:55
You trying to get a discount?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:37:45
You and me effing both.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:52
I bought near the top of the 2013 bubble, held for years, made it back.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:21:20
I would gladly give you a dollar tomorrow for a cheeseburger today.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:35:50
I have an order at $9k. One more dip before Christmas?
