I message support in regards to adding my American Express card. It is not working. Why would it give me the action to add funds or to add card if it is just going to deny me. I told me to call the number on the back of the card which I did. They told me to contact you guys. I am getting the run around here and frankly it's too late now because the dip has already passed, but I would be overjoyed to use my AmEx a couple times to purchase some coin. Can you help me with that at all

Well my issue with coinbase was I bought on the dip on the 25th and the 26th. I normally it says I'll receive my funds within 3 to 5 calendar days. Looking at the history of my purchases which there is a decent amount, it's never taken more than 5 days 5 days has always been longest wait time for me. Obviously verified and all that. So when I ordered on the 25th and 26th I get a message saying that my coins won't arrive for 8 days and to expect them on August 1st. I tried canceling the payment it would not work of course they don't have a phone line cuz they have about 8 people working there, so naturally  emailed support. After  3 days on the 27th I finally heard back with a canned response from them basically saying I'm shit out of luck, but just the copy and pasted response from the frequently asked questions page. I wrote back to them in a way you could probably describe as less eloquent and slightly inflammatory to let them know I am putting a stop purchase order slash claim against them and I don't give a fuck if you freeze my account. Well to my surprise on the 31st, even though the time frame of when I'll get my coin listed on the wallet said August 1st, my Bitcoins, both purchases on the 25th and 26th where received. Now if I didn't receive those coins before then I would have been extraordinarily Furious. I thought it was diabolical and abysmal ethics to give me my coin after the split. Eight days to receive and 7 for the next payment. And to get them both at the same time on the 31st. I have never in my life receive my coins earlier than the date posted on the purchase notes in the wallet. And now I don't really know what to think, I'm very happy now. But to state that I won't be getting my coins till August 1st is just wrong. But in the end it didn't happen, and I know this is such a cliche, but it really is the principle of the matter. I hope that makes sense I'm rushing through this on my phone. Anybody else deal with anything like this or something similar happened?

*Thank you*. Almost as bad as Thomas Edison getting all the credit for electricity rather than Tesla.

It's not about politics believe it or not, although I can see why you would think that because that's all Donald Trump talks about and his supporters and opposers saying one network leans one way or the other. This is a major news Channel, but even a local channel would be fishy, but this major News Channel isn't just a channel working independently, it's parent company [is one of the biggest media and production companies in the world] (  so who owns NBC? Comcast, which of course is owned by an even bigger company that you can see in the link, GE. I think you'd be a fool to believe it's just a news story, just passing unbiased news that states the facts and explains the real situation to the common viewer /s. So this Mega billion dollar production company just so happens he promoting a so-called "better" Bitcoin. Maybe I'm too big of a conspiracy theorist, but of some of the people I know and work with, from a pretty low-level conspiracy theorist and even this puts up a red flag. Just my opinion

Personally, I am not happy with such prospects. For this reason, I think to look for other platforms.
