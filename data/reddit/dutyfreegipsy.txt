Why does the US Dollar started to have value back then? Because somebody told the people „instead of gold you will now be paying with these paper bills our governmet issues. You can buy things with it or you can keep it at home to save some of it.“
It‘s basically the same with btc except for the fact that btc is more secure, not inflationary and borderless. People saw that you can use it to pay for things, or to store value in it.
In the end something gets value because someone thinks it can be valuable for certain usecases.
Just imagine the people of america back then deciding „nah bro, thx but we better be paying with chocolate bars - keep your paper bills“. That way people would have shiftet to using chocolate bars as a means of payment / store of value (I know, stupid example but I hope you get my point).

Perfect list, thanks for summarizing!
I want to however argue with you about nr. 4. I don‘t think it is decentralized when 70%+ of the hashing power is located in China (and could be influenced by the chinese authorities). Not arguing on the thought behind decentralization of btc, just if that hashing/mining power gets allocated it destroys the purpose imo.

Never heard of that, so I‘m gonna read up on it. Thanks a log for your reply!
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:48:57

Very interesting insight, thanks mate!

Seems like a good buy, will definitely put all my money in it
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:35:53
Very cool, always wanted to do that too. But is it worth it? From what I read it‘s just draining your pocket because electricity will cost a shit ton of money

Mate, do you even Venn?
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:45:20
I was also buying into btc and ltc. But somehow I think ltc lost it‘s usecase during time that‘s why I only buy btc anymore.
Or can anyone enlighten me?

The fact that you ask such a question shows, that you probably shouldn‘t invest ANY money anymore

Bitcoin is a concept and a working replacement for cash - speculation times are long gone
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:01:37
I do that from time to time, yes
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:26:00

Oh please...

Best advice is to only invest money that you can afford to lose. Best is to just consider the money invested as lost so you don‘t get upset if prices move. If you are interested in cryptocurrencies then read up on the coins you want to invest in. What problems they try to solve, how/where they can be used, how adoption looks like for them. Get a basic understanding of how blockchain works, that‘ll come in handy. If you don‘t want to pick the coins yourself then I‘d suggest you have a look at the top 5-10 coins at the moment. If you‘re not focused on a single idea/concept/coin then split your money evenly amongst some of the coins out of that top 5-10. Don‘t bother panicking when prices move, they always do. I‘d suggest you consider your investment as a 5-10 year investment, so just buy and hold. Don‘t touch it unless you need it or you think you had enough. That‘s a personal opinion tho.
But I think the „get rich quick“ times are over, so don‘t hope to become a millionaire by tomorrow.
Sidenote: Mining is not profitable if you‘re not a multi-million dollar company.
And if you EVER read or get sent something that promises you free crypto - it‘s a scam. I’d highly suggest to read up on how the different scams in cryptocurrency space work so you don‘t fall for them.
Enjoy the ride!

There‘s a friggin jungle growing in front of these stairs, no wonder people think bitcoin is shady lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:26:32
These scam-posts/videos are pure cancer
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:43:51
I‘m not an expert but I believe the mining difficulty gets adjusted to the available hashing power in some way
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:39:12
Only (small chance) in solving this would be to hire a good lawyer, track down the instagrammer and sue the shit out of him
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:14:48
Adoption. Utility.
