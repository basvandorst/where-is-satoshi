The sentence he got is totally out of all proportion to the crime. Most people would see that even if they don't support drug use. He had all his money stole and has to spend the rest of his life in jail. I feel sorry for him.

That was a great documentary. I'm quite new to it all and still learning about it.

I thought that all along. I never saw the point in launching countless different coins that brought nothing new to the table. They're practically worthless now and will contine to get worse. The only ones making money from them are the ones who pump and dump.

Their verification process is absolutely ridiculous. They won't accept my passport ID because it expired a couple of months ago. That shouldn't matter for ID purposes. If it was a fake ID I'd have bought one that was in date. Passports are for travelling abroad and only need to be valid for that purpose and not for opening a fucking Coinbase account.

I don't see why not as its only to prove my identity. If I opened it a couple of months ago it would have been fine but now all of a sudden it's no use. Nobody ever told me it was mandatory to have a valid passport at all times even when you aren't leaving the country.

The bank really should mind their own fucking business. Next they will be saying which companies you can't purchase groceries from.
