In the wiki there is a list:
I always use [Anycoin Direct]( You get the coins within a few seconds after paying and they have alot of payment methods in Europe.

Done and got the money, cheers!

Oh btw, there is still a special promotion that if you fully validate (which means show your passport on a webcam) you get 5 euro credits for free. I did this awhile ago but I see the promotion is still ongoing.

Does this also work if I'm already a customer? I'm not maximum verified yet.

Yeah I always buy at [AnycoinDirect.eu]( Had few questions the first time I bought there and they were really nice in the live support.
I needed 5btc and got it within 30 seconds after the payment!

Jup, your right. Anyway I looked through the comments of and what I also saw is that they only seem to react at posts where the comment makes sense. They aren't just randomly spamming. Atleast that is something ;)

In the spirit of confession, I'm not related either lol. (why do we all need to say this)
Anyway who says Circle isn't marketing themselves on reddit? Atleast does it with their own account, but sometimes it looks like Circle has a crap load of accounts who post for them. And like said the hype about Circle and the amount of Circle supporters here is kinda weird to me. That's why my guess is that they bought off some group of people who promote them here.

Yeah but you shouldn't make a post about it an hour before.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:16:44
Dude, that's not true. Why karma whore before we hit it.
Edit: At the time you posted it was €0186.5 while the ath is €1089.

A broker which holds coins and their database is hacked. Great...

Well, depends if you are in Europe or America. I personally use Anycoin Direct in Europe. But there are multiple good companies there  but they only serve Europe.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:32:07
Yeah, their promotion team stopped getting paid to post here.
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:30:49
Did use them a while ago but they didn't pay out. Stopped right after that.
@_date: 2019-01-31 13:59:26
They have been hacked twice afaik.

No problem, if you have any questions you can ask them in the live chat. Most of the time I talk with a guy named Bram, he's a legend, he solves any problem you have and even helps if the problem isn't on their side.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:17:51
I order there all the time. They have multiple articles on Coindesk and such. If you pay with SEPA they wait with giving the coins till they got the money, with Sofort you have your coins within a minute.
Hope that helps.

Why is this news? There are 100's of ways of buying bitcoin with iDEAL.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:40:31
Same here! And they seem to be online like 90% of the time in my timezone atleast (CET).
