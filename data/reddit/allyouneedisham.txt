This is how it starts. It's good.

I would say you've been brainwashed by a company with an agenda. Why the hell would any company use some 3rd party blockchain like vechain and pay for it? They won't. They'll build their own.

Stock market at ATH. Bitcoin market cap is a fraction of a FAANG stock. Aims to exceed market cap of gold. Why wouldn't they be moving this?

I distinctly remember thinking that we were hitting the peak in December of 2017, and telling people this. Everyone said "no way, man, this is just getting started it'll peak mid-2018". If people think it's going to bottom 6 months out, it probably already has. This isn't scientific, it's strictly anecdotal, but the exact same thing happened back in 2013. I look for comments like this.
The shit coins aren't going to rebound though. Get out of that crap now.

A Volvo is not an economy vehicle. It's a premium brand..

Well if you want to put all your money in Bitcoin that seeks to dethrone gold (and more) into supply chain management coupons that's your decision. It seems like no contest to me.

Lol you're kidding right. Have you learned nothing from every ICO ever? Money is the most valuable application. Bitcoin has no CEO. It has no agenda. It needs no marketing.

\*shrugs\* maybe you'll contribute the the retirement of a few shit coins devs if you keep holding on. The ones left, that is.

This won't be the first time. You'll see. There were shit coins before ERC-20. You can find them at the bottom of CMC. Same smell. Different flavour.
History lesson:
Exhibit A: Peercoin "the original proof-of-stake coin"; market cap: $13M (that's right, 'blockchain 2.0' POS is nothing new)
Exhibit B: Namecoin "real utility!"; market cap: $9M
Exhibit C: PayCoin "the first stable coin with a price floor, and the future of payments!"; market cap: $125k
There are many, many more examples. Today, an interesting example that stands out and has the same look and feel of these coins is Cardano. It's over $1B but adds remarkably little new to the ecosystem. We'll see where that ends up in 2 years. My guess is &lt; $15M.
These were among the top altcoins. They had large communities with substantial support. They didn't rebound. What makes you think this time will be different? There are remarkably few coins that stuck around. They had NO NETWORK, and therefore, NO NETWORK EFFECT. In fact, they died FASTER during the last bull market because nobody wanted to be left holding the bag. They did not follow the leaders.

This is not retail. They're still coming.

Just like everyone thought the bear market was a tad early?
@_date: 2019-04-06 01:00:16
But why?

I can cite numerous sources but bitcoin was the cover story (and prominently on the front cover) of The Economist in 2015. That's pretty mainstream. Google "The trust machine" to find it. Honestly that's just one of many many examples both in print on television and online. 2017 is late mainstream coverage. But we're still early because people weren't buying.

It also went from $300 up to $5k before that.. I'd hardly say the bull run started at $5k.

I don't advise it at all, but actually many people who have been taking out loans to buy over the last few years have done absurdly well. There was maybe 3 weeks in all of bitcoin history where people got rekt from doing this.

Bitcoin was getting mainstream coverage during the 2013 bubble. People have known about bitcoin for some time. I would argue that 2017 was actually late mainstream coverage.
The biggest challenge has always been and remains buying bitcoin. People will invest as soon as ETFs proliferate. That will be the catalyst that takes this 10x from here.
People don't trust crypto exchanges, nor should they. This will also be the death of shitty alts because money won't flow into them as easily.
