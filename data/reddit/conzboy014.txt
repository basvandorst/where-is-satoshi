Its not called Bcash
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:14:57
Not the same shit, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:07:56
And they would of been right to do so. Buy BCH around 250-300 and sell 1 BTC at say 3600, would provide much better profit return. 
looks like BCH is taking the cake. Bad advice here
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:38:37
When i received my BCH i kept it with my BTC . Is it eating me alive? No not at all. Thanks crypto wizard
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:36:56
You spent time doing that? Youre apart of the problem.  
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:23:16
Bitcoin cash, BCC BCH* 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:07:42
So like Gold? I mean, if you want to send money and not deal with the fees then use Bitcoin Cash? Its an honest question. Im not for either side either, but from my knowledge BCH has lower fees and faster transaction times. But times change my friend, i wish Bitcoin was cheap as shit and fast but its just.. not 
EDIT or litecoin 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:26:04
Im not. Its a network upgrade. Its not forking into another currency/coin. It remains the same Bitcoin Cash with an Upgrade to the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:48:55
So youd recommend using Bitcoin for drink transactions/food/ etc? 
Cheapest, fastest alternative to send money?
Its not tho, litecoin is. Or bitcoin cash. Lol i just dont get what the hate is for other crypto currencies when Bitcoin cant do everything. 
I honestly just transferred $305 btc to my exchange to trade from my wallet about 7 hours ago and it took 2 hours and cosy me 13$, like one person has a fast transaction and then declares it on the sub like its a good thing. If bitcoin was so fast and cheap you wouldn’t have to broadcast it to the community. 
I love bitcoin. I love crypto. But its not doable for small transactions and the cheaper alternative anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:19:38
Honestly, i’ve held 2 BTC since 2016 May, received 2 BCH at fork, 2 Bitcoin Gold at fork and ive held them all.. i’ll most likely always hold my BTC and BCH but the bitcoin gold looks like itll be a good sell off Lol. I just dont know who to trust and i dont care. Ill hold both because i got in cheap and the BCH was free. 
BTC/BCH is 35% of my portfolio and itll forever stay that way.
I just cant stand the divide in the bitcoin community, the forking and all this shit. Its exhausting so i just dont do anything and we’ll see where we are 2-5 years from now Lol. But i mean is Bitcoin growing 65-70% in 4 weeks normal? THERES JUST SO MUCH DRAMAAA

What is ur reply to ops post bout the situation
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:37:18
Its just funny, BCH goes on a run and does well.. everybody here : PERFECT TIME TO DUMP BCH!! Lol like shit eh, seems like its perfect every time it goes on a run. Mentioning it just shows your fear and i dont even care about BCH or hold any
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:39:43
Ooo no reasoning, i like this. You must be right
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:55:35
You know what, if thats the case then that would be awesome and legendary. But shit, until that happens its not the best alternative for small / fast transactions at the moment. 
I have total patience i just think other cryptos have a solid place in the crypto world and you cant discredit them because like or not they will be around. The fact is currently, there are cryptos that are faster and cheaper for sending funds in this moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:38:45
Its not forking its a network upgrade lol... 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:45:39
But this isnt common... i believe Bitcoin is a store of value and shouldnt be used on micro transactions anymore. Thats too expensive and still too long.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:06:03
Bubble? Lol youre in Bitcoin and telling another about a bubble bursting? How fucking ironic coming from a group who insists bitcoin isnt in a bubble BUT EVERY OTHER COIN IS CUZ REASONS
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:01:51
Or when it dumps again
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:26:40
Ok soo... fiat is floodig back into alts.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:46:24
Man you need to relax. After the fork the alts will be on the rise again like they always do, bitcoin will still be at an amazing price but, you could be saying the same shit if an alt sky rocketed 100%.... always regrets
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:25:56
Goodjob to everyone selling and buying ALTS 
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:44:21
Not even an ETH Pumper. Im full into BTC and i was into ETH. I bought in at 55 and sold for 265 and got more BTC. But i think the word SCAM is ignorant to describe all of what ETH is. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:32:43
Wow total scam alert. ��
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:28:31
How the fuck is ETH a scam? Thats a serious comment 
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:37:00
Hahahaha yeah dont think its gonna go back down to that. ETH is not LTC
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:18:48
Sure, far from a scam though. FARRRR from a scam. Lol like that word cant be used to describe it. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:06:16
wow ty for the clear explanation 
That perfectly describes everything going on 
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:03:31
Lmfao calm the fuck down. Those are legit points.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:04:57
Lol where he belongs because he supports bitcoin but has a general concern about usage? Fuck you
