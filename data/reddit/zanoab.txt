They still have their brains. I'm sure they have time to manually sign transactions by hand.

Would it be any different if another country control a majority of the hashrate?

Have you tried opening an account at a different local bank? I'm curious if you just picked an over-protective bank or it is a more widespread issue.

This is messaging which is one way. You just put a publicly readable id for the receiver(s) and everybody will receive it regardless. You can claim to be the intended receiver but it won't mean you can decrypt it. When the intended receiver does get the message, there is no reason to broadcast that the message was received. The reply-to id could be included and encrypted so that the receiver would know where to send a reply.
If done with privacy in mind, the best anybody could do without compromising devices is track the location where a message originated from and who it is sent to (in limited fashion if ids are not re-used like bitcoin addresses).

They do a key exchange in person or transmit the public key another way should as through a mutual contact. When you have a government this determined to maintain control, you can't trust anybody unless you meet them face to face or a proper chain of trust.

My parents had an auto loan account re-opened just to be charged a fee. Decades after paying it off and closing the account, the bank managed to track down our address and sent us a bill requesting payment on the account. My parents called the bank, told them what happened and explained they have a letter confirming the account was closed decades ago. The rep looked at the account's records, verified it should be closed, and supposedly removed the random fee and re-closed the account.

Leaving OSX's keychain service unlocked with access to critical services is a disaster as well. Not only did he leave the money visible inside a car, he also left most of keys and passwords inside with proper labels.

Probably thought up by the same people that think you can make a single-threaded program faster if you flip a switch to make it use four cores instead of one.
