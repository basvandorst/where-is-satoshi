For those who are unfamiliar with the background. PBOC issued an order banning third party payment processor from dealing with cryptocurrency trading platforms in last December. Since then, Chinese exchanges generally provide two methods for CNY deposits: a) wire transfer to exchange’s bank account b) buy vouchers from their own voucher shop which supports third party payments processor.
So we have known that bter and btctrade suspended CNY deposits but they only supported method b. BTC38 supported both method and both are now disabled, which confirms the rumor going around in recent days.

Yeah. News says PBOC held a serious talk with Chinese banks and payment service providers on April 24, requesting them to stop withdrawal for trading platforms and close accounts completely.

There have been some rumors about a new government document circulating between Chinese traders yesterday, which is the cause of yesterday’s price crash. And this should be the one.
The title is Monitoring Report on the Work of Preventing the Risk of Bitcoin. This report was made by Payment and Clearing Association of China, and was forwarded to all banks by PBOC. 
Some key points of this report:
1. The report put emphasizes on the importance and complexity of preventing the risk of bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin trading platforms moved the funding channels from online to offline. Trading platforms’ funding agents use personal accounts to make transfers. To cope with the concealment of current funding method, all banks should share their information and create a unified blacklist of related accounts.
3. Preventing the risk of bitcoin is a long-term work. Continued efforts from all banks are required to completely cut off funding channels to bitcoin trading platforms.
