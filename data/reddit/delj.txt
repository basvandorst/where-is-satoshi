I use a google wallet card for work and I get comments on it more than half the time. I also comment on other people's cards anytime they have an interesting card.

You guys can't keep your hands off of anything... Regulate, criminalize, prohibit, tax. You make me physically ill. I can literally feel the sickness in my stomach.

Property rights are ALL that matter in dealing with pollution... you don’t even need a middle man for this. In fact, I would be willing to bet if people didn’t learn to depend on the government to fix everything for them, som problems would be fixed faster, like fracking pollution. Communities full of people whose problem solving process didn’t solely involve running to daddy for regulation, could create more change (and faster) with direct action.

First world countries give a shit, shit holes don’t. It’s about the social consciousness. The method of enforcement isn’t as important as the will to make it happen. Regulation and effect often chase each other back and forth in a chicken and egg scenario. In India pollution is terrible, yes. But these people also shit on the street. They don’t care in the same way. In California, people buy and use clean energy cars in large amounts, because they care to do so, even though there is no regulation to do so.

No. Those charges were dropped. Those charges were brought up only to make people like you say things like that.

No. He wasn't charged for it. Beyond that, if he did, it was the right call. Armed people wanted to put him in a cage for doing nothing ethically wrong or even generally considered immoral. It was self defense. Regardless, he wasn't tried for that. The charges were raised to make people like you say things like that.

It's not some conspiracy, it's not so that people would talk about it on the internet, obviously. It was to convince the jury he was a bad man, obviously. It also really helps when major news networks show that stuff to hundreds of thousands of people. Not that he necessarily didn't do it, but the reason was not to convict him, but to ensure that the jury thought he was a bad man. I think they used that tactic because they used that tactic against my dad. My dad was a terrible man, but he wasn't a violent killer, but when he and his gang were arrested for selling weed, the prosecution intentionally made it appear as though my dad's gang was very dangerous and violent, to ensure conviction. I can post a link if you're curious about that case.
