Maybe this will jog your memory: 
In other words, if you didn't muck around with importing bip39 seed words from an external source, yet somehow ended up with addresses starting with 3 in Electrum, chances are you have a multisig wallet, not a segwit wallet.

The process is pretty straightforward. As part of the new wallet creation wizard, you'll see an option to create either standard or segwit wallet. 
Yes, there will be fees. Which is why you should move your coins to a new wallet only when necessary especially with the high transaction fees these days.
Another thing you should know is that by default, Electrum 3+ creates what's called bech32 addresses. They start with 'bc1' instead of '3'.
Unfortunately not many exchanges or wallets support sending to bech32 addresses as yet since the format is so new.   for more info on this topic.

Sorry if this sounds like a stupid question but did you set the derivation path properly when importing the seed words? For segwit, it should be m/49'/0'/0'/0/0

I'm not familiar with the requirements of the new fork, but for past forks like BCH, getting new coins out of a multisignature non-segwit address was not an issue.
That is not to say you do have a multisig wallet though. Only you can find out for sure. For example, when you try to send BTC from your Electrum, are you also prompted to send the signed transaction to a cosigner? If yes, it's a multisig wallet.

Hmm.. that can't be right. Did you try changing the filter from 'receiving' to 'change' in the Addresses tab?

Check the total amount, bottom left corner of the application window. What does it say?

Electrum officially supports the native segwit addresses (bech32 - starts with "bc1"). But it can be made to use bip49 addresses (p2sh segwit - starts with "3"), which are what most segwit-enabled wallets use today.
Caution: this requires the use of bip39 seeds, which electrum does not guarantee support for in the future. It's best to move to the native segwit wallet later on when that address format reaches wider adoption
* Since electrum does not generate bip39 seeds, you need to get yours elsewhere. Personally I used  I copied the standalone version from here:  to an offline computer and generated my bip39 seed there.
* Download/install electrum 3.0.2 or higher (make sure you get the officially signed version).
* Choose to create a 'standard wallet'. Then choose 'I already have a seed'.
* When prompted to enter seed, under 'options' check the 'BIP39 seed' box.
* Type in the bip39 seed you got earlier.
* Change the derivation path from m/44'/0'/0' to m/49'/0'/0' &lt;-- this ensures you get the correct bip49 segwit addresses.
* Password-protect your wallet file if you like.
* All done.
I've created and used a bunch of these bip49 segwit electrum wallets on my Windows/Linux machines. So far they work flawlessly.
