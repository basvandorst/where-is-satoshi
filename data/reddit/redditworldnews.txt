Some people complaining that there are no downvotes. 
Yes, there are, **just uncheck the "Subreddit Style"** tab, to your upper right hand.

Bitcoin's Blockchain is a *World Wide distributed Ledger* (see: [Blockchain technology]( No individual or group and no central power or government can control or ban it. Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralised computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). Dollars are not backed by gold anymore since long time ago, they are printed by the trillions out of nothing by the private institution called "Federal" Reserve.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Almost for free (a few cents fee).
 
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically)
 
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
 
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
 
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
 
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
 
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿

Nice to see We Are Change promoting Bitcoin, it is a very popular organization, and it is exactly what journalism should be.

There is no possible "Blockchain" without the token to register on the ledger (Bitcoin).

Yes, because bitcoins are the tokens that power the blockchain, you can't have one without the other.
