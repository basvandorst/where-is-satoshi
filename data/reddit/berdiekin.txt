You can't compare bitcoin to companies... Apples and oranges man. The software comparison also doesn't work, because bitcoin doesn't get its value from its software but from its network. AKA the people that use/hold it, the developers that work on it, the miners that mine it, the companies that accept it...
The "thin air" argument comes from the inability to understand that a currency could have value based on anything else but a government. "It's not backed by a government (or powerful entity in general) thus it can't have value."

Go ahead, clone the bitcoin repo and start your own chain. Or copy amazon's website.
You wanna know how much those would be worth? i'll tell you: nothing.
The code is a tool to an end, nothing more nothing less.

A handful BTC when I dabbled in mining around 2012. Mined for a while but lost interest (was still in school and had other way more important things to do like gaming 'n shit). Had the private key on my computer which got formatted somewhere along the line and only remembered when my little bro started talking about bitcoin again in early 2017.

The thinking is that "bad people" might see this, figure out who you are IRL and mark you as a target for a robbery. Wouldn't be the first time someone's forced to hand over their crypto.

A simpler explanation is that if your account gets hacked or the exchange gets hacked you could lose your coins. Or even something as simple as the exchange going offline "for maintenance" would mean you'd be unable to access your coins.
Best to keep them in an offline wallet (a hardware wallet like a ledger nano) because remember: not your keys not your coins!

Impossible but they can make it very difficult to use for anything other than p2p by (for instance) making it illegal for businesses to accept.
Also by making it illegal to buy/sell/own alltogether. I realise this won't stop everyone but it will keep out the normal person.
Wouldn't shut it down but would put a big damper on enthusiasm and kill adoption.

y'know back when bch originally forked I wanted to give it a chance. Because, why not right? Two project based on the same tech but with 2 very different approaches to the scaling debate.
But seeing what a shitshow it's become I'm glad I sold.

that's what a smart person would do. At least as long as you still have cash to spare and still believe in the project.

you've got a point.

You're laughing but depending on what lambo you get it coukd actually appreciate in value. 
Only have Ferrari examples though, Ferrari la Ferrari value has gone x5 or x6 since its launch for instance.

Just look at the amount of ICO exit scams and you've got your answer.

It's perhaps oversimplified but that is what happens (depending on what goes wrong tho, If it's purely a routing error then it could also be an error message but it still needs to be propagated back to the originating node).
If (for instance) the hop from C to D fails (for whatever reason) then C must fail the incoming htlc (update_fail_htlc) from B. 
B must then in turn fail the incoming htlc from A.

Also only time will tell whether any of us got bamboozled into buying crypto, xrp or other.

Read an article a while back that had some pretty convincing arguments for a bottom somewhere between $1500 and $2500.
It was based off of bitcoin's past cycles and then averaged. (inb4 "past performance is no guarantee of future results" or whatever).

There is a reversal of the HTLCs (see my other comment). Though if it's a purely routing error, then it could take the form of an error message. 
Though i'll admit that this is the limit of my understanding of the lightning network.

Nobody knows. All you can do is spread the risk, which is what a lot of people here do. Buy for a set amount of money at a set interval, could be once a week, after every paycheck, once a month, ... whatever works for you.

This is indeed one of the challenges (/shortcomings) of the ln. If you send from A to D (for instance) the ln software will try to find a path to D via as little hops as possible (which is far from easy btw).
If you're trying to send BTC from A to D it'll go A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D with the added caveat that each of those channels must have a capacity of at least the amount of BTC you're trying to send. 
If a channel is insufficiently funded then the transaction will fail and must be reverted. Which is a whole other challenge as now the payment needs to reverse through the network back to the originator.
