They exist! (Sorry for the repost, my other got buried).
A lot of this stuff follows [Pareto Distributions]( The measure of "decentralization" for a Pareto distribution is its ⍺ term. The lower the ⍺ value, the more the distribution is centralized. But as Nassim Taleb points out in his essay [*The Fourth Quadrant* (2008)]( it's hard to estimate ⍺. Also, the smartest whales in BitCoin spread themselves across a lot of accounts to hide.
Another measure is the [Gini coefficient](  A Gini coefficient *G* of 1 is completely centralized, and 0 is completely decentralized.  For a Pareto distribution, its Gini coefficient *G* = 1/(2⍺ + 1), which is how the two indexes are connected.

A lot of this stuff follows [Pareto Distributions](  The measure of "decentralization" for a Pareto distribution is ⍺ (the higher the ⍺ value, the fatter the tail of the distribution).  As Nassim Taleb points out in his essay [The Fourth Quadrant]( it's hard to estimate ⍺. Also, the smartest whales in BitCoin spread themselves across a lot of accounts.
Another important notion of decentralization that is often neglected is the principle "The system can recover from any particular node if the rest of them fail".  Some systems of Proof of Stake (specifically, Tendermint) fail to satisfy this notion.  It is because of this principle that BitCoin could likely survive the nuclear annihilation of a country and still keep on trucking, 'cause it's kind of awesome.

Yay!  :D Not a scam (maybe, probably)
Good job dude.


Awesome. I'm just use to so much BS in the ethereum sphere (I'm new to crypto, Ethereum has been my first exposure), it always warms my heart that the BitCoin wizards are so legit.
I'm super excited.  I can't wait to see the all the stuff you guys have in store for BitCoin down the road!

You say nice things all the time!  People never pay attention.  You've been quite vocal in praising the lightning network, for instance.
But I am honestly skeptical about how pragmatic this would be to implement in BitCoin.  From my time at Ethereum reviewing a certain boy genius' impractical nonsense I am inclined to demand "literate code or it's a scam".

I know it's such shit... but their failure will be instructive, right?

Might be a good idea to watch ethereum to see how well it fairs with it's 12 second madness...

Well if you have 100s of accounts but there's a good validation system in place to prove they are functioning properly before receiving payment, then it's a waste of time.
Of course you'll end up with guarantees like "If X% of the network is behaving properly then there's only a Y% that an attack with N nodes will get through".  Statistical verification that two ray-tracings are the same will also have a false positive rate and a false negative rate to take into account, so it's a none-trivial problem.
But you're talking like it's hopeless, and I don't see why you think it's so bad...
