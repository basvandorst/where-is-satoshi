There is definitely a roll though I don't know it will pick up until the price stabilizes some.  The issue with loaning out in BTC right now is that if you believe in bitcoin then you likely believe that the price is going to rise.  This would be great for a lender because in addition to interest, a lender could receive back the same amount of bitcoin that is worth more at the maturity date.  This makes assessing borrowers and loaning in bitcoin potentially more risky than in fiat because 1) we don't know what a bitcoin will be worth tomorrow, much less in a year from now and 2) a borrower may be able to pay back a bitcoin today but might not be able to if the value of bitcoin doubles (or appreciates more) between the borrowing date and the date the loan matures.  I think the end result of this is that bitcoin borrowers are more likely to engage in fraud at present.  
All that said, absent the practical realities of likelihood for fraud and the potential for borrowers to not be able to repay if the price appreciates, if you really believe in bitcoin, making loans in bitcoin is extremely attractive on the lender side.
On a longer timeline and assuming bitcoin achieves success as a currency I think bitcoin will serve the interests currently served by banking with fiat - high yield savings accounts, loans, investment instruments (including derivatives and swaps), etc.

why do you think the 'system' doesn't allow for fractional reserves?

I can't imagine there's anything "cheap" about renting a satellite and server space in military bunkers around the world.  I don't know enough about their SDK or APIs to respond there but if physical security is how coins can be stored securely (finally), then amen.  Cold storage w/ 3 of 5 around the world is what jumps out at me from the announcement and that's a big win for the ecosystem's infrastructure (especially after the Bitstamp hack).
