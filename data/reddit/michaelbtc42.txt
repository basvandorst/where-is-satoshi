Most probably invest in infrastructure and venture which supports the bitcoin ecosystem.

Are you saying that you keep 100% of your bitcoin holdings in bitcoin or you keep 100% of your net worth in bitcoin. The question is how much bitcoin you keep as a percentage of your net worth.

The game is rigged. Peace prize is only for someone like Obama, at least not satoshi.

Of course I will. I didn't say someone should not buy and don't hold bitcoin. Did you realized that simply buy and hold bitcoin doesn't help bitcoin grows. DO YOU? I didn't see anything wrong here by invest in infrastructure and venture which supports the bitcoin ecosystem. Your logic is flawed.

It is okay if your expected risk is align with your expected return. First, you understand the risk so you are financially and mentally prepared. Second, you accepted that risk to expect that kind of return. Third, the risk to reward ratio have to be rational. For example,  It is not rational to risk 10 to reward 1. But fine if risk 1 to reward 10.

I have 1~2% of my net worth in bitcoin and dogecoin. I recommend people invest not more than 5% of their net worth depends on their risk profile. It means you didn't risk more than 5% of your net worth in a long position in bitcoin. People should also have to find out what is their net worth annual growth rate to adjust their allocation in Crypto currency portfolio. It is not that hard. First, identify the percentage of your investment properties in your net worth. and then Second, how you diversified your investment properties into different asset class. Crypto currency is an unique asset class, you can treat them as commodities as well.

Well I understand that. 50 hours to get initial deposit back and another additional 50 hours to receive total ROI. Seems legit to me.
