Yeah, the bitcoin were "seized"!
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:29:45
Come watch me
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:19:25
Thank you !  You are the reason I went ahead and got myself a Bitcoin wallet, the reason I got interested in Bitcoin and the reason why i'm learning more and more about bitcoin.

There's a ton of potential with streamium, and you're right, screencasting should be an option. We should also be able to add overlays. Hopefully, as OP mentions, this will be huge!
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:28:06
Well, that was way easier than I thought. [I got a wallet from Bitcoin Core, it is currently synchronizing with the block chain.](
I still have to learn a lot more, I want to encrypt all the data associated with my wallet, I also want to learn more about cold storage or offline wallets.
I'm not sure if I took the best service for my wallet, I just picked the first that appeared in a list for Windows computers.

There's no jinxing Bitcoin technology. How many time has it died since it was introduced?
[Nice try](

Hi, i'm new and still trying to figure out everything about Bitcoin. I still don't have a wallet as i'm not even sure how to get one yet. Do I have to pay for a wallet? Is this just a program running on my PC or Phone?
Also what are nodes? And what is GBTC? Who are the big players in Bitcoin? like Mt.Gox (i think this is close now), Coinbase, etc.
Should I consider mining for bitcoin, or would the electricity required to mine bitcoin be more expensive than the generated bitcoin?
What will happen when there are 21 millions Bitcoin in circulation, will miners stop verifying the blockchain?
I'm still too confused to get started, but I'm starting to think that I should invest in Bitcoins as it seems to have a bright future.

Great answer, thanks.

Stream says that i'm still live on both cameras.
Could you hear me talk?
Both stream are the same, just from different angle
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:33:10
I wish it did, it only prompted me to use my webcam and microphone. Screencasting would be amazing for the gamers who stream on stuff like Twitch.tv

Still waiting for payment proof from [satoshinine.com]( which is part of the same network.
Does anyone have any payment proof?
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:52:29
Thanks, added your site to my bookmarks.
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:36:17
sure, just xfer your btc to **1MEgy3Mh24z6j9ekXsrFPSUduv6wbe4eFD** and PM me your Paypal email address, i'll transfer 250$ USD once I get confirmation of the transaction.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:26:11
Yeah, The P.todd doublespend thingy when he bought Reddit gold for a friend of his.
Why don't you like Blockchain.info as a wallet option?
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:33:41
How do you lose money?   Do you mean getting it stolen?
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:46:25
That's $909,174.00 US Dollar at today's value. You're already rich!
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:05:36
Yeah, i guess you are entirely right. As another user said, we should only use those web-based wallet service as an interim to send/receive BTC, and use more secure options for our long term coin storage.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:46:20
Yeah, I actually looked into that when I first got my wallet. I could create my own personal keys and import them to Blockchain.info to increase the security of my wallet.
I also agree that relying on ANY web-based wallet could have its own risks. For now, I have very little bitcoins and wouldn't mind losing it, but I intend to some day create a paper wallet that is completely disconnected from any online device, I actually read alot about creating the safest possible wallets.
Thanks for your input I'm still trying to figure out this whole Bitcoin phenomenon. I'm really intrigued by Bitcoins, but i still believe that Bitcoin is the future of currencies.

Alright, I recreated an account and I can confirm that it was obvious and easy to add my bank account, which it wasn't back when I originally tried in November. I remember specifically seeing a message that Coinbase doesn't support bank account transfer from Canadian banks.
Now I have to wait a few days to see the micro-transaction that Coinbase will deposit in my account to confirm it.
Hopefully the fees are reasonable when buying bitcoins on Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:02:16
Nice, less than 15min later, 2 people are watching me.
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:48:36
This stream from another camera and another angle is 1USD/hour
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:46:56
Wow, You've been active since you created your account ... 2 days ago.
Piss off, if you don't want to post with your real account.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:00:45
Nope, withdrawal request was made on January 11th. I still haven't got anything. FAQ says it takes a week, but it's been 15 days already. I also emailed the address in the FAQ to inquire about banners I could use on my website for referrals and I never got any replies. That was about 10 days ago. 
It seems it is not legit. Don't waste your time. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:51:39
Nah i'm kidding! They are worth about $0.10 each now, so maybe 210$ worth. I'll give you 250$ for your btc, that's a 1190% return on your 21$ you paid when you bought them.
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:31:28
Nope, no proxies used here.
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:54:54
Is this new? Because I swear when I got a Coinbase account not more than 3 months ago, it was not possible. Also, this link seems to mention another company, Vogogo?
Now, according to [my emails]( I tried to get a Coinbase wallet on November 2nd 2015. Now, if the Vogogo option for Canadian banks existed back then, you need to make it more obvious.

The only time i sent bitcoins instead of receiving was to buy a game on Steam. I bought "Stranded Deep" for about 16$ (which was 0.00581524 BTC) in late July 2017.
Every time i see the transaction in my wallet, I regret it because it shows me how much those BTC are worth now. [They are worth 47.12$ as I write this message.]( And the fees i paid back then were like 1.70$, they are now worth more than 5$.
JUST HODL!
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:36:22
We have to stop calling it Bitcoin when it's on Coinbase. It's not Bitcoin anymore because it has become centralized and controlled by Coinbase.
I recently received 10$USD in BTC on my Coinbase wallet. They are keeping my money hostage.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:30:26
Except for the Coinbase part. Fuck them and their stupid fees. Coinbase is not bitcoin, it's centralized.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:39:44
Does anyone have a link to this article that isn't on Forbes.com ?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:44:43
Can it please drop 1 or 2 thousands dollars so I can buy more?
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:49:16
Steam accepts bitcoin.
I bought a game for 16$ in august 2017, I grin every time i see the transaction in my wallet that shows those bitcoins are worth 33$ now.

I'm really disappointed that Crash Course immediately associated Bitcoin with illegal markets.
