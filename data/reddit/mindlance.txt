I really don't think it would be faster. I imagine a lot of the big ones would still not do business with sex worker related subjects, to protect their corporate image. 
Specialized crowdfunding sites are already a thing. There are 'adult-oriented' crowd-funding sites, but they are sketchy and charge outrageous fees. A site that worked right, didn't charge crazy fees, and looked professional, would make a killing.

Ehh....The word socialism (and the word libertarian, for that matter) have meant so many *different* things over such a *long* period of time, that I tend to not rush to judgement (either positive or negative) when I hear them.

We're not even talking about 'scammy' sites. The cc companies use that as a justification, without really proving that porn sites, or sex work sites, are scammier than average. This is simple prudery on their part.

I consider the actions of many adults to be fucked up, not to mention self-destructive. Doesn't meant I want to threaten them with prison and death. If people feel the need to do heroin, I don't have a problem letting do heroin, and letting them have the choice to buy it online or on the corner. To think that legalizing 'hard' drugs would lead to lots of otherwise sober and happy people becoming enslaved it to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of addiction. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:48:48
I never said he was a hero, and his intentions don't really matter all that much. What matters are the results. 
He helped sell drugs. A lot of people want drugs, some people need drugs. Either way, he gave them what they wanted. Yes, he made money doing so. He was running a business, a business that fulfilled needs in a way that made it safer and less risky over all for both the drug users and the drug dealers. 
Thousands of people got what they wanted, sometimes needed, and did so in a way that was safer than their other options. So yes, he helped people and saved lives. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:30:27
He has nothing to rehabilitate from. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:02:40
He helped more people, and saved more lives, than you ever will. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:04:23
He did so under the impression (given by the extortionist) that he was protecting not only his own life, but the lives of thousands of others, from arrest, jail time, fines, ruination, and (given that US law enforcement would be involved) a significant chance of violent death. He gets my sympathy. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 12:01:07
But, I would submit, it is necessarily anti-authoritarian.

On blackmailers and extortionists, who certainly presented themselves as having to problem ruining the lives and quite possible causing the violent deaths of dozens of people.

* The supposed targets were blackmailers and extortionists, willing to ruin the lives of multiple people for financial gain. This situation was only possible because of the black market nature of Silk Road, which mean you couldn't go to the cops (and why should you? The cops were coming to you, in the form of the blackmailers and extortionists.) The threatened exposure by the blackmailers and the extortionists would have ruined and killed many people. This was not putting a hit out on somebody 'disrespecting' him, or anything like that. These were acts of self-defense, and the defense of others.
* People die from stuff. People die from [alcohol]( from [bee stings]( from [coffee]( Would those 6 people be alive if the Silk Road never existed? Unknown. What we do know is that [the Silk Road was safer for drug users and drug dealers than the streets]( People will still die from drugs (and a lot of other things.) And now that the Silk Road is gone, more people will die than otherwise might have. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:07:58
To some extent that may be true, but it is also because, due to the nature of the nature and the use of bitcoin, so many more people *know* about it than know about the average prosecution of the average drug dealer. Logically, it would make sense to be as worked up over everyone in this situation, but attention is limited. He's a novelty, so he gets more attention. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:44:04
That doesn't meant you can't root for the fiery, violent end of the bull.

I'm not okay with kids driving drunk. Doesn't mean I think alcohol should be prohibited.
Most 'addiction' is actually fucked up attempts at self-medication. These kids had problems. The drugs weren't the problem. The drugs were a (doomed) attempt at a solution. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:01:27
He disobeyed bad laws, and in the process saved lives. I don't think he's being idolized, but that's why a lot of people aren't condemning him.

Bitcoin would not help Greece. Bitcoin would help Greeks. There is a difference. If Greeks are to survive and prosper, Greece (defined as the current political system) may need to fall. 
@_date: 2012-04-26 18:27:05
There is an unfortunate amount of centralization in the system, especially the Greco system. This is because it's not a commodity system, like bitcoin. It's credit. The central authority acts as a credit rating system. That's why it's important to keep the authorities as voluntary, transparent, and democratic as possible.

IP should not exist. The only possible justification for property laws is scarcity. If there is no scarcity, there is no justification for property. Information can, when done correctly, be copied a virtually infinite number of times. There is no scarcity, so there is no property.

To say that a society is *safer* and *more civil* is not to say that it is particularly civil and safe. We suffer from low expectations, where if the government doesn't actually drag us out into the street and slit our throats then it is a marvel of democracy and jurisprudence. We need to set out sights higher.

If you have someone who likely to be a high priority target, as it were, call up a news crew before you do it. One of those consumer defender shoes. The brasher the better. Alternatively, call up a half dozen local podcasters and/or vloggers with an activist/populist slant. Again, brasher the better.
Give out the blankets, including the ones to the high priority target. Watch and wait. When the thugs come to confiscate them, gotcha! Bombard them with bright lights and harsh questions. Hell, bring along a couple dozen (now obsolete) flash bulbs, for that disorientating 'ambushed by reporters" effect. Keep yelling at them until they run off. Post the video. Maybe have the podcasters do some followup interviews with the homeless guys.
You'll get press from Hong Kong to Paraguay.

If one of those beauty contestant winners inspired world peace, yes. Before an idea can be implemented, it must first be imagined. Ancaps did that. Not social democrats. Not socialists, monarchists, or any other major political philosophy. Ancaps.

Hide. Really, that is the thing to do. You need to ambush the sons of bitches. Hide, and when they start to do it, burst out and hit 'em, tabloid reporter style. 
It is the common tactic for libertarians, when involved getting authority figures on camera or mic, to be very self-controlled. Never raising their voice, always asking the questions politely, etc. I would not recommend this. Approach this like you were sleazy TV anchormen and you'd just caught a politician leaving his mistress with his pants around his ankles. Yell. Keep yelling. Do not wait for an answer. Hit them with all the righteous indignation you can summon. Do not let them get their balance. Demand to know how much they're getting bribed for this. That sort of thing. Your purpose here is not to get answers. Your purpose is to get them sweaty and fidgety on camera. Then upload.

You don't think the anarcho-capitalist philosophy did not have an enormous amount to do with the creation of bitcoin, then you are fooling yourself. Ancaps are the reason bitcoin exists. The people who made it may or may not have been ancaps, but the ancaps did something even more important than making it- they dreamed it. 
A voluntary, decentralized currency, beyond the control government? That is the ancap dream. To support it, is to support them.

The people were lied to. The money they gave him was given under false pretenses. That's fraud. It doesn't matter if it was a dumb fraud or not. It doesn't matter if the people defrauded were dumb or not. Murder is still murder when it happens to bad people, and fraud is still fraud when it happens to idiots. These are initiations of force, of aggression, and should be treated as such, regardless of the fitness of the victims. 
And yes, ideally, the government wouldn't get involved. Ideally, this would be handled with defense agencies, and arbitration, and all that. The government getting involved will guarantee that some part of this is going to be grade-A bullshit, and we can, and should, follow what the government is doing closely and critique them when appropriate.
But sense no one else was stepping up to take care of this, the horrible, awful, no good intervention of the government is better than this asshole getting away with this.

The idea of a voluntary currency not controlled by a government is anathema to orthodox liberalism. You would have to look very hard indeed to find a good liberal, identified as many others as a good liberal, pundit or philosopher that would endorse bitcoin, that would in fact not condemn it, and even then they would definitely be in the extreme minority. 
Whereas it is quite easy to find libertarians and anarchists of many stripes that quite enthusiastically support bitcoin, including quite influential ones. They have supported the idea of voluntary currencies beyond the reach of governments for years, decades before bitcoin was even thought of, before it was even possible. 
To declare that bitcoin is politically agnostic is to be willfully naive. You might not believe in politics, but politics sure as hell believes in you- and most of the politicians political philosophers don't like you very much. The few political philosophers that do like you happen to be largely anarchists and libertarians. So they count. They are connected to bitcoin, like it or not. Get over it. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 01:20:08
Of the recognized political and societal philosophies, they are one of the very few that do. They are one of the very, very few that have been calling for something like bitcoin to exist for decades, have been imagining how it would work, etc. They are also undeniably one of the major philosophies that influenced the fiction surrounding voluntary, virtual, crypto-currencies, the fiction that inspired the creation of bitcoin.
