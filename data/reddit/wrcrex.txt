Well, if you can hold, sure! However, what about greed of buying after a crash and doubling down? Selling early? Taking out personal loans to get in before the boom? Buying high and holding after a brutal dip can be hard, as we're seeing right before our eyes here on this very sub. If you're holding in an unwavering manner...great for you and this rant would not necessarily apply in your case.

Events like this separate the amateur traders from the big dogs. Anyone with a portfolio and half a brain can make an adjustment here and proceed with business as usual. This market is still very easy to make daily cash on.

The real question is... Do you feel that event is about to repeat itself now? ��

Marketing is mostly bullshit? How do all companies make their money? Google, Facebook? Is it not advertising? I advertise for a living. I run a proprietary system for it, and it pays the bills. If you dont beat a trend, you end up bidding too high on keywords. Sorry you missed the analogy.

People keep saying that its fallen before...but the difference this time is that there are other coins that actually are better and cheaper, so don’t count on it going back up... this time is different.

Buy some during tomorrows dip and more if it dips after futures. The goal is to accumulate more total bitcoin before it skyrockets. More power to you if you can get it at a discount. ��

Cant see it going too far below 11k during futures launch (from now to Wed)

The most alarming part about all of this is that people in this sub are acting like BTC is the ONLY path to wealth. Um, no. If you are smart, actual money-making will never go out of style and is always far more predictable than betting the farm on a crypto... Highly competent bankers and RE Investors see money like BTC gold rush guys all day long. GUYS - Money CAN BE MADE outside of BTC. Pull your heads out of your asses because the early train is gone. If BTC is really going to the Moon then you can buy incrementally...Just dont lose sight of what's really important...making real cash in your real job (yes, people make a fuck ton of real money working 9-5's or being self employed, too). Hold your assets and play it smart. In my opinion the Moon landing has already happened and now people are betting on fairy tales. Congrats to those who cashed out, and God Speed to those who hold too long and lose several million. This is no joke.

Strongly recommend putting your autobuy around 13K. You'll be able to quickly flip it over the weekend or hold...whatever you want:) it's swinging quite a bit and seems like it will go under 14,5 for sure. Right now 13K is looking like the new 10K:)

Bitcoin is already falling into the shadows... Not gonna go up to 20 anytime, ever. Cut your losses.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:12
Yes Bitcoin has dropped like this before but this is not anything like the previous times. Its not going back near 20k so cut your losses now if you convinced your wife you needed to buy a full coin last week or did it on your own for the hype. If you were smart youd have moved your coins when it started stonewalling around 17-18 for like five days.

As all the HODL spammers sell or send their BTC to BCH....Tonsssss of hypocrites and fairweather traders on this sub...

Hodl they said. It would rise they said. The boom would come again they said. Don't fold a weak hand they said. To the moon they said, and bullshit I said. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:06:36
Okay guys the party's over Bitcoin is clearly a shitcoin. Time to get into some real trading if you want to make the actual coin because the money in Bitcoin has already been made on the first boom so I think it's time to stop dreaming and get realistic. Pretty sure that the money transfer service zelle took Bitcoin and donkey kicked it right in the nuts by getting instantly adopted and running a super bowl commercial. This message was sent through text to speech so you can kiss my ass about the run-on sentence. K thanks bye

Back in 2011 btc wasn't popular or a thing yet. It became mainstream last year and boomed. Tanked because there's no real world adoption. This crash is for real. It's done. There are no fundamentals behind Bitcoin to make the value rise. It wasn't mass adopted during the boom and the crypto experiment has now ended. If you have any experience trading securities equities anything you'll understand fundamentals have to back the investment. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:49:13
It happened last year so you may wanna re-check your facts. If you want to buy now knock yourself out.

"redditor for three months". Nice try, bud.
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:18:54
So now that we are certain Bitcoin isn't going up long term, I'm sure every one of you is still going to hold and buy more right? After all, you're supposed to buy low and sell high, according to the armchair hedge fund traders here on the BTC subreddit.
