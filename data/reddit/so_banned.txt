To be perfectly honest, I learned a lot from you.
I learned how not to be like you, and I very much look forward to profiting from it.
Yes, nobody can **make** you go away. Congrats. Meanwhile, everyone will groan when you enter the room, which is probably not far away from your real life.

Let me spell this out for you so you can understand it. 
**Anybody who was "hurt" by investing in cryptocurrency**
***WAS A CHILD TRYING TO PLAY AN ADULT GAME.***
If you fell into that category, nobody feels sorry for you. You should have done better research and understood the risks. You should NEVER have risked more than throwaway cash because it **was never supposed to be an investment vehicle.**
People who did what you did were careless, stupid, and uninformed--and they **got what was coming to them.**
Nobody is bullying you into silence--you are welcome to cry about your bad investments anonymously on the internet all you want--but it doesn't mean people aren't going to correct you.
To be perfectly honest, your comments don't sound like a burned investor- you sound like a schill for large companies and investment interests trying to get people to offload so they can bottom the price out before it inevitably goes back up.
This stuff isn't Betamax shares, bud- if you got out, you should get completely out and let the big boys divvy up your money instead of sitting on the floor crying. :)

So you’re letting your FUD affect other people by naysaying because you know you’re gonna feel like shit when it goes back up and you panic sold like a little wimp
You just want a friend and honestly it’s sad
