I noticed another scam crypto exchange CoinEx Market  . There was no photos of team on their website and their whole website looked shady. So i decided to investigate. And then i found this article from project that revealed that Coinexmarket is scam  and the fact that Coinexmarket is stealing money looks like they are scam. Also several users reported that they received logged in from different IP addresses on their accounts and lost their cryptocurrency on this exchange  . When scammed users tried to alert other users they get immediately banned in telegram. Stay away from coinexmarket exchange! It's 100% scam. It is clear that ICO that CoinEx Market have now is also scam  . 
Several projects paid money for listing their tokens on Coinexmarket and never got listed  . Coinexmarket exchange stole their 1 BTC and never refunded. Here is proof:
