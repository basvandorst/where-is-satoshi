I never understood why people think throwing money at a project makes it magically go faster.at the end of the day is just some devs either deciding to work on the project or let it rot. Why do you need a million bucks to implement feature x? So some ass hole can live an awesome life before his work is even done?

@_date: 2014-09-24 17:28:39
are you kidding? they release violent offenders to make room for drug dealers. Every execution is some big public event with protesters and everything.
No the US doesn't execute criminals, at least not enough of them.

@_date: 2014-09-18 03:16:38
Step 1: wait for everyone to accept bitcoin
Step 2: ACH can fuck itself
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:44:38
Seems legit
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:13:30
Yeah that is pretty depressing

bitcoiners are some smart motherfuckers
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:12:16
i dont think they can
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:02:18
yeah those minimums are total bullshit, i wonder how many fractions of bitcoins are locked away on junk mining accounts. i personalls have like .0004 locked away on deepbit
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:16:44
the sky is falling!

@_date: 2014-10-16 20:28:37
Yah I once had dreams of buying low selling high via coin base...their system is 100 percent designed to stop such things. I still don't understand the 7 days thing ach isn't even THAT slow
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:12:24

@_date: 2014-08-26 21:52:27
well i think for starters you could putz around with an FPGA and VHDL(VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and eventually  try to make it into an ASIC, by the time you figure that out you will know enough to make one.
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:22:39
maybe has something to do with the price falling
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:22:42

Merry Christmas and a happy New year
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:05:04
I think vested interests are going to tank the price and buy up all the coins dirt cheap I think this is going to happen soon
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:14:59
yeah its true, all these whales need to get lost before any type of stability comes

That right get the sheep used to paying for things with their phones them bam bitcoin wtf?
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:32:57
I always found it funny how it takes like 2 weeks to sell your coins on coin base that way if you try to sell when the price is crashing you will almost always get screwed because the price will bounce back by the time you get your cash
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:41:07
I chuckled
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:58:23

@_date: 2014-09-30 01:39:13
just looks like a bunch of cool guys having a good time
@_date: 2014-10-13 02:56:03
Just realized I don't even know what a block really is. 25 private keys or 25 million private keys? A key per a satoshi? And how are past transactions factored into all of this
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:13:48
i dont want to get gangraped tho
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:15:02
i sold during the recent scare and bought back in when it was low, I ended up breaking even because of their fees ;/ should have gotten some extra coin out of it
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:26:56
all of crypto is  a game of musical chairs
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:04:22


yeah it has 140 confirmations
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:05:04
yeah this is pretty outrageous has cost me hundreds so far
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:04:44
i sent bitcoins from poloniex

@_date: 2015-07-02 02:07:33
fucking idiot
@_date: 2016-02-18 06:27:35
article basically says currency is based on trust, then goes on to say bigmac coins would be better than bitcoin.... bitcoin is unique in that it doesn't require trust, the inequality is disturbing but I imagine its always been this way; bitcoin just lays it all out bare to see
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:13:47
Holy shit haven't been following the case too much but this is huge, definitely one of the top issues of the next few decades
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:00:11
because bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:16:42
give it a break you white knight beta male
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:52:41
holy shit they are giving out .5 btc
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:37:37
basically yeah but you would need shitloads of money, and alot of the companies making miners are doing the mining themselves so its been taken to the next level
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:23:23
case in point
@_date: 2015-04-10 06:25:45
who thinks of this shit
@_date: 2015-04-19 06:04:51
suck some dicks
@_date: 2015-11-20 06:19:41
Wouldn't the machines end up owning all the bitcoin eventually?

why buy stuff with money when you can still get people to take your monopoly notes
@_date: 2015-10-14 03:36:08
i was thinking about it today, I think it could destroy patents holding back innovation. Good ideas can be monetized regardless of laws
@_date: 2016-05-30 00:06:21
yeah they should have diversified from btc sooner
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:37:55
