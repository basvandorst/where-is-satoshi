Yes I am asking on reddit because I don't know how to use bitcointalk. Honestly surprised that there aren't any similar questions to this.

Thanks for this.

What framework or tools did you use to integrate lightning with Unity3D?
@_date: 2019-02-12 09:20:15
I don't think it would work as outgoing connections won't be routed through the SSH tunnel, only incoming connects. It could cause an error if the node were advertising itself with an IP from the VPS, but make outgoing connections with a different IP. Also, OpenVPN is probably less latent than SSH.

Do you have any tips on getting more incoming lightning channels? I am planning on running this node to create a Lapp, and I don't want to risk running into something like this again.

Thanks a lot, I got it. I also tried receiving from yalls.org and it worked perfectly. Send me an invoice and ill pay you back.

This setup is for using a static ip from a VPS, not your home ip.

Ahh nice I’ve heard wireguard was fast. I couldn’t find a good in-depth tutorial for setting up wireguard. I also don’t want to use Streisand because I want to use the vps for other things and the stuff Streisand installs may slow it down.

Thanks mate, I can see your channel. Im going to send you a pm.
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:15:10
Interesting! Do you guys run the VPS on your own hardware or do you rely on another cloud provider.

Could you explain how to get a return channel with yalls? I connected to the yalls node as a peer, but my node (02d5efae50c1cdc6011e40b74f061ea4f444088865ec14a59e4ee6cf0d71c842fc) still isn't showing up on the list they have to request an incoming connection.
Edit: It is working now. It just took some time for my node to show up on the list.

This site u/Quackman88 posted above does that, it is what I used.

This is for situations where you have a mobile connection or a cgnat which doesn’t allow you to port forward.
@_date: 2019-02-12 10:24:26
Yes, I think it is similar.

Unicorns are private companies, AMD has been public for a long time.

Also a question, do I need to have an incoming lightning channel in order to receive payments?
@_date: 2019-02-20 01:05:52
No, you can even run one on a raspberry pi.
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:26:41
It is because it is a centralized middleman. Just give an address and allow us to send from any wallet.

Shill. Go back to r/buttcoin.

BitPay supports BCH.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:26:46
Now it could be Bitmain.

I am looking for a desktop wallet. It would be better if I could use Bitcoin Core as a light client on my laptop.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:26:25
I think breadwallet allows you to do this as well. Is there a desktop wallet that can do this?

How is your relationship now with former Gox employees like Ashley Barr/Adam Turner and others?

He replied to tweets by Andreas  and Trump 
Update: Whalepool  tweeted this 14 hours back but it still hasn't been banned. There have been no posts on reddit about this and only 7 tweets about it on Twitter.
