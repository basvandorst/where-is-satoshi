It's the other way around: Once LN is as easy to use as Paypal it will hit mass adoption. Problem is that it is hard to make LN easy to use, and competition (cheap on chain txs) will eat it's lunch before that happens

I hate to be that guy, but still: I don't get it. Can someone give me examples of things that I can build with the 21 computer that I cannot build with a server and a bitcoin payment api? (I'd love to love this company, pls help me do so)

It's a reimplementation of the Bitcoin protocol. The main difference to bitcoin core is that "Toshi saves much more information and indexes more data than Bitcoin Core... It requires much more space to store the blockchain (~220GB vs ~25GB as of September 2014)... This makes it possible to run much richer queries that would otherwise not be possible with Bitcoin Core.
Some examples of queries which Toshi can easily answer, which are not possible with Bitcoin Core:
* List all unspent outputs for any address (Bitcoin Core only indexes unspent outputs for specific addresses added to the local "wallet").
* Get the balance of any address
* Get the balance of any address at a specific point in time
* Find all transactions for any address
* Find all transactions in a certain time period
* Find all transactions over a certain amount
* Find all transactions given a set of addresses"
