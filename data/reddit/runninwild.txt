Just made a small donation. I've wanted to donate to Wikipedia in the past but never actually went through with it. Bitcoin is a different story, a Bitcoin donation is so easy I couldn't pass it up.

The US dollar isn't backed by gold......

The point is even though the US dollar isn't backed by gold it is still a store of value. It's the counter to your claim of gold being the proper store of value.

I'll just accept that we disagree on the US dollar being used as stored value. 
On the other hand we're back full circle to Alan2420's point that you can't actually go down to the store and buy things with your stored value(gold). Good luck in your gold only world while the rest of humanity keeps using fake money to purchase things.
