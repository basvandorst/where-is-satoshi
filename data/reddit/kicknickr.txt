I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean. I see that you claim to have some sort algorithm good at predicting market (which I'm sure it could). While I'm technically holding I'm still betting quite frequently and have some money doing so. How can you claim that my figures of personal bet wins/losses (on the future price) are too high in magnitude, relative to what? Could you please clarify?

Thx bubb. Cynics are known for having a rudimentary understanding of how btc predicting works...

Well I've been doing this for a couple months now so I'm no expert. I will say though that I have made profit, but really not relatively much. When I first began I had made many mistakes, and did fully understand how certain betting websites worked exactly, along with simply poor knowledge about the market, and finally lack of luck. I lost ~250$ in the first month. However, I now made it all back and then some(100$ profit). I mainly use the websites:   and  . This websites are unique in the sense you are assured exactly how much the payout out is before you bet, whereas most sites 'payout' is misleading in that it refers to the payout if the bet were to close at that instant. Perhaps the time spend on this is not worth the small amount of BTC I've made, but really it doesn't consume that much time maybe 1/2hour-1hour/day .

I hear that advice everywhere, and I can afford to lose it, I just wanted advice. Not like I ever bet anything more than 100$ of BTC anyways. I wouldn't say they're worthless though.

Yes a single given number out millions of possible ones has the same odds of being correct as the whole range on values either above or below a single value, plus the fact it is relatively deterministic and not random at all, that makes sense. Tell me when the lottery has a binary betting option.
