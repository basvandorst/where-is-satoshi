OP would you be prepared to create [an augur prediction market]( to make book on your forecast?
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:01:24
No biggie. I needed the practice :)
PM me if you have any questions.

Killer! Cheers :)

Here is [a quick and dirty regular expression that I whipped up]( just now:
    ^1[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{26,35}$|^3[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{26,35}$|^bc1[a-z0-9]{39,90}$
	
I tested it against these sample addresses:
    1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2
    
    3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy

I'm a little rusty on regexes, so it's a pretty naive pattern as these sorts of things go. Plus, I'm not an expert on the different address formats. But if your setup takes regular expressions as filters, this could give you something to start playing around with anyway.

Thank you for that :) What did you name the one piece with the galactic nebula in the triangle? And what do you call the one with the Bitcoin dripping the paint from that beautiful lady's eye?
Incidentally, you mentioned Chicago. I worked at the Art Institute one summer during a huge exhibit. An ex-girlfriend studied at the school. Did you study there yourself?
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:53:38
My pleasure :) I'm glad you appreciated it.
My OP linked to three different surveys. I learned something interesting from each one of them.
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:30:42
Ha ha ha ha!
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:05:39


Naturally these kind of survey results should be taken with a grain of salt. But let's look at it hypthetically. 
Going by that rate of *adoption* over the ten year existence so far of cryptocurrency (and nothing else), it would take approximately one hundred fifteen more years at that rate for Bitcoin to reach one hundred percent adoption: `((100 / 8) * 10) - 10 == 115`
Please feel free to correct my math.
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:38:16
Thanks, man. 
Isn't that chart based on:
* One coin out of several thousand different crypto coins?
* The assumption that one wallet corresponds to one single individual person?
Granted, any survey—including the ones I linked to above—should always be taken with a grain of salt. But your above Bitcoin Blockchain one in particular is a lot more coarse-grained than the ones I linked to. So it's comparatively that much less representative of all cryptocurrencies owned by individuals.

I took a couple art classes in college. Plus, I worked one summer as a security guard in a famous art museum.
Would you mind if I took a stab at what your piece looks like it is communicating?
1. Aerosol, PCBs (metaphors for environmental hazards) are...
2. Something noxious, dangerous like...
3. Being poked in the eye with something sharp...
4. Whatever that "something" is, it's nebulous to the untrained eye...
What is your own interpretation of it? If you don't mind me asking.
EDIT: Or what was your brief?
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:48:29


Yeah, but that's a different question/metric though. Ain't it?

How about that! I studied art but am now a self-taught software developer. I have developed software for the financial sector. What a small world Ha ha :)
I don't live in Chi-town anymore. Thanks for the suggestion though :)
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:58:54


I can't argue with anybody with different results, because I don't know, personally, what the actual numbers are. I can only quote the sources I linked to above.
It'd be awesome if you could likewise share links to your source for that number. Please?
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:25:23
Please, can you share with us which banner has the artist's picture?

Nothing in that video is news to me. 
Interesting ideas, but I'm good ;)
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:44:01


Like I said in my comment you replied to: it's a hypothetical calculation.
This quote from [page 10 of the ING survey]( summarizes the salient point of my admittedly inexact calculation:


@_date: 2018-12-03 15:33:04


Ninety-two percent of which were so *biased* that they never bothered to acquire any crypto.


Your comment is one of the more interesting ones in this thread. Because I can't work out from comments like yours whether you think a lower percentage is a good thing, or whether you think a higher percentage is a bad thing.
Myself? I'm ambivalent. I don't own any of the cryptocurrencies. I'm just a curious bystander. I only quoted some sources I found after the question popped in my head during the course of researching what I find to be an interesting social phenomenon.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:15:51
In my opinion, I think the main thing that blocks cryptocurrencies' success is that not enough of the general population feel that we *need* any of them. The *How-To* is secondary.
In order for any of them to be massively adopted, people have to be convinced that it is absolutely *necessary* to have it.
I say that as a software developer who is intrigued by the technology but who has not yet felt any strong *need* to buy any cryptocurrency. I can sate my curiosity by playing around with a Docker image of RegTest or TestNet. Or read the source code in github or whatever.
From my perspective, Bitcoin is just an "Interesting idea, but I'm good" type of thing at this point.
Figure out a way to make it so that it is an absolute *MUST HAVE* for people like myself who don't have as strong a desire for it as yourself, then you've got something.

Reading the words in that same banner, my guess is it is conveying that *something* will end in tears.
