they will spend it if the price gets up to a level that we think is worth it.  but for that to happen we need to increase the blocksize and user adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:36:06


actually no.  4x increase in BW and storage requirements (4MB) but actual decrease in tx count to "one" at the maximum 4MB blocksize (1 big attack signature).
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:47:28


it is relevant.  the relative fee for this type of tx may be higher but overall fees  would be much smaller.  plus, we would be able to utilize many more smaller dust like outputs than we can today since price would likely be higher due to wider spread usage.
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:59:25

@_date: 2016-08-29 18:28:01


that's pretty easy.  as you admit that bigger blocks will create more users, it means price will go up from more demand for coin.  rising prices make it much more affordable for coin holders to run full nodes as realization that Bitcoin is spreading becomes a reality.
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:26:29

limiting TPS is very different than your examples.  esp since we're dealing with a monetary system with which we seem to agree.

why should i have to pay 4x the amount for a reg tx vs a p2sh multisig just to facilitate LN enabled by SW? i'm not into locking up my money for an indeterminate time just for a bunch of coffee buys.  btw, LN was supposed to be finished by now.  where is it?
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:20:41

that's not a problem anymore as core has encouraged the spawning of several alternatives now.

you should b/c miners need to pay bills in dollar terms.
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:16:05
sure it does.  i'd take a seat on the Fed if you allow me to shape monetary policy in the US while getting paid 6% to boot.  way better than you can get with cash on deposit with an indeterminate upper bound from influence.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:21:58


nothing you've argued supports this contention.


it does not.  more users would mean more growth and with it price.  running nodes at that point would be out of pure greed to make it so.


anyone who's been paying attention to Bitcoin since the early days, and i have, can see the degradation in network performance over the last year.  and yes, it's clear that it's b/c of full blocks, tx delays, and higher fees.


i think small blockists should be the one's to fork away from Satoshi's original vision.  don't mistake inertia for support.
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:03:52
the real question is do you believe in free markets?  apparently not, since you seem to feel you can divine the optimal blocksize limit.  which apparently just happens to be 1MB.  i guess Satoshi was indeed truly a God by picking that magic number 6y ago.  
sarcasm aside, NO ONE knows what the optimal limit is, therefore logic dictates that you let a higher mechanism figure it out; that is what free markets do.  lift the limit and both onchain and offchain solutions will autoregulate themselves with the most efficiency.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:59:45
as an avg user, if i saw user and tx growth on the network, i'd increase my home BW capabilities no problem.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:24:28


they don't have to.  their incentives only have to align with their own.  which is profitability.  which means, in the long run, they will charge fees to make money.


nothing wrong with competition.  ultimately miners would survive in an unlimited scenario with a decentralized distribution.  right now, the centralization is unacceptable as a result of 1MB.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:32:28
like you have any idea what any one person has or has not contributed.  nice try though.
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:04:08
i agree with you.  the best way to deal with this problem is to increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:53:31
that's what you'd expect in the early days, like now.  with time, more and more ppl will indeed use Bitcoin as Money.  and then, the hodlers of BTC will make even more as the price escalates.

@_date: 2016-08-30 14:20:47
Gavin and Sergio only came up with that limit and headersfirst mining to satisfy the FUD spewers.  which goes back to my original pt.  there's no reason to believe a large miner will commit economic suicide by self constructing an attack block of non std tx's which takes minutes to verify b/c it will get orphaned.  not only that, he will be identified immediately on the network and countermeasures could be deployed against him if necessary.
if this attack was plausible, then why hasn't a large miner been executing it over the last several years to gain an advantage?  and even now?
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:13:32
**The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by the Congress as the operating arms of the nation's central banking system, are organized similarly to private corporations--possibly leading to some confusion about "ownership."

@_date: 2016-08-11 21:34:24


thank you for this.  i agree.  that's precisely why we don't need a limit at all.


i used to be able to send tx's with no fee at all.  now, never.  Rusty and others have also done studies showing avg tx fees are on the rise b/c of full blks and mempools.  that's terrible for new user adoption.
the surest thing to a higher price is to increase the userbase thru cheap, fast tx's.  there's nothing wrong with that.  most of those ppl won't hold privacy as militantly as most around here.
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:32:21
considering that i wouldn't be talking this way if i wasn't around Bitcoin longer and have more coin than you, quite high actually.
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:51:08
no, i meant the requirement that sender and receiver have to interact.
with gambling sites in particular there is a high volume of rapidly occurring bet tx's occurring btwn an anonymous user and the site.  as you've described the MW interaction it appears to take too much time and direct communication for it to be useful for these types of situations.  or am i missing something?
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:40:01
you should do a similar calculation for CT.
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:13:47


you're assuming that the BS core devs have the same vision for Bitcoin that it's users have.  there's considerable evidence from the debate of the last year that's not the case.


the intial $21M was from various legacy VC funds with billion "dollar" wealth bases.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:01:32
i think the real problem is whether or not core's vision of Bitcoin meshes with it's users/investors/early adopters.  the last year has shown that there is indeed a problem.  should Bitcoin's long term goal be as a new form of money or should it be smart contracting?  i think there's a fundamental difference.
have you ever seen these contracts you mention?
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:35:34

your problem is that you think it's all over.  i got news for you.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:47:39
of course you'll have a diversity of strategies.  but look at the past 7y.  there hasn't been any significant miner mishaps like collusion for 51% attacks, widespread tx filtering, etc.  why should this change if the limit is lifted?  the incentives for behaving seem to be pretty strong in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-21 06:09:59
that goes against everything that BitPay has observed and published.  they see spending go UP when price rises.  and it makes sense; hodlers might as well take some gains and enjoy the fruits of their success.  as price rises, the distribution of coins increases.
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:34:33
hmm, better not to verify?
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:10:14

given this, how can MW ever be practical with online commercial sites specifically like gambling sites?
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:29:59


in the world before full mempools, he would have been affordably contributing to reduction of the UTXO set.  but in today's reality of high tx fees, you're asking him to increase the UTXO set by avoiding the high tx fees.  this is a soln to a problem of your own creation.
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:12:17
like i said, he wouldn't answer me, so i wonder.  an additional $50M would come with certain requests/demands i'm sure.
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:30:52


i still think they're an issue even if you don't.  certainly the initial VC groups could be an issue as well.  founders always have to strike a balance btwn their wishes and their investors.  i don't know why you would try to deny this.  
it's esp a problem if you're dealing with a new form of money like Bitcoin.  who wouldn't want to try and control it if given the opportunity?
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:12:28


maybe if you'd unclog mempools by lifting the limit and allowing growth with it's resultant price rise, that dust could be spent?
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:58:23
probably Adam Back.  but i specifically asked him about whether those "walk away" provisions still applied after they received the additional $50M from AXA and PwC and he wouldn't answer me.
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:16:08

blah, blah, blah.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:30:08


that's easy.  b/c as more tx's become mineable from bigger blocks, there will be more money to be made from those tx's.  any smaller players forced to leave will be replaced by new miners (big or small) incentivized to go after those extra fees.  that's how free mkts work.  
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:05:42
simplicity is part of it's strength.
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:46:25
how do you know what limitations Bitcoin has?  after all, it is a free mkt currency that no one, including you, could envision as recently as 8y ago.  many, including Greg &amp; Adam never thought it would work; Greg even wrote a paper on it.  yet here we are.
it's quite possible Bitcoin mainchain can handle microtx's; free mkts in money have an enormous capacity to figure things out.  and if it doesn't, given a no limit situation, then alternatives like LN &amp; SC's could offset the congestion.  the main pt being, let onchain and offchain solutions compete unfettered.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:27:50
since neither of us has any proof to definitively make our argument, wouldn't it be more prudent to let both onchain and offchain solutions compete by eliminating the limit while simultaneously devving LN/SC's?  if miners start abusing things onchain everyone can just move over to offchain tx's.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:52:22

which is why alot of ppl like BU.  lift the limit altogether so we don't have to revisit this.  i've never heard a good argument as to why, given no limit, the miners won't enforce one themselves by adjusting minfees to maintain or even thrive off of spam attempts.
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:11:27
with new strings attached.
@_date: 2016-08-21 15:21:38
did you ever read Bitpay's analysis?  they said exactly the opposite of you and i choose to believe them, not you.
personally, while spending coin on merchant business will become important, right now the distribution of coin to more hands is most important.  and that is happening.  the last year's price action and uncertainty surrounding the blocksize debate has cause alot of former hodlers to cough up their coin and crack cold wallets.  you can see it in their postings.  that is good.  the more stakeholders, the more chance for success.  it's early stages.  patience.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:23:49


not really.  this policy effect has only become apparent over the last year since blocks have become full.
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:12:41
nah, authoritarian fits just fine.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:44:42


most ppl haven't even heard of it.  that's b/c with high fees, it isn't offering anything the legacy fiat system doesn't.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:44:10
no, you're just being pedantic and devoid of any evidence.  i'd say full node count would increase as a result of many more users.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:08:21
then you haven't done enuf tx's.  it's easy as pie.  and faster and definitive.
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:50:25
but given that, you then have to look at their actions.
we've had an unsuccessful scaling debate for over 3y now.  the last year has brought us tx delays and higher fees, both unacceptable for a large number of users.  the core solns of SW/LN/SC's have been late.  users and early adopters are leaving the system and it's clear altcoins are thriving.  at what pt do you say enough is enough so let's just do the simplest thing and increase a constant to stem this outflow and let more newbies in?
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:53:33
i don't think it means much that most of the founders were core devs.  Hill certainly wasn't.  what you also have to realize is that it's important who *funded* the startup.  and the answer to that is huge, legacy financial institutions like AXA &amp; PwC.  it's a well known phenomenon in the traditional financial world that investors insist on having a say in the direction of the company.
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:01:22
well, the whole mentality around current coding is to allow the charging of fees for any and all work done so the ethos doesn't match what you're saying and may continually change to make it impossible.

or maybe fortunes.  or maybe not.
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:58:23

@_date: 2016-09-30 18:04:22


oh but there is.  in today's modern world, it is the USD aka the world's reserve currency.  if Bitcoin wants to achieve that status, it needs to be accepted at those levels, which at the current moment in history is worldwide.
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:49:15

You haven't been around that long but do you know who has historically been the greatest complainers of the volatility? The geeks.

You actually shouldn't be proud of that. Without a limit, we'd be careening much higher in price from increasing adoption. Which bitcoin desperately needs at this point. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:12:38


so you agree with me.  and mempool auctions don't have speculators and thus no liquidity thus invalidating it as a true fee market.


should be obvious.  it's called a "problem" b/c of the easily observable delays and volatile fees that force transactors (which presumably you care about or maybe not) to get frustrated and leave.

@_date: 2016-10-20 15:59:12
it's not a true market b/c it isn't efficient due to the absence of liquidity via speculators.  it's an auction of desperate transactors trying to funnel thru a restricted opening all at once, remember?
a true market exists when your individual tx doesn't measurably affect the price b/c there's always someone on the other side willing to take your price or one very close to it.  like on the exchanges with small spreads.  it includes all possible actors that want to engage in that market including speculators.  that's the antithesis of what's happening in this mempool auction.
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:46:28

it's really pointless arguing with you b/c you refuse to acknowledge basic economic arguments or tenets.  you have your own pre-conceived ideas of how you want Bitcoin to function and you'll never acknowledge or accept anyone's ideas except your own.  yes, auctions are not true markets esp as applied to jacked full mempools.  it doesn't work and the results are obvious to everyone who looks at them in an objective way or has to experience the numerous frustrations that many users have presented to you.  you just don't want to hear them.

@_date: 2016-10-11 17:52:14
Of course, but the big points being that you need great demand, acceptance, &amp; liquidity (not 2tps). 
@_date: 2016-10-03 11:17:15
For one we agree. It's the means to get there. Let the market choose between onchain and offchain. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 11:15:34
Yeah, you're probably right about the blocksize debate going back to 2010. Where we differ is your conclusion that Satoshi never wanted bigger blocks.. Link me to where he said that. If you read all his writings in totality, it is clear he envisioned Visa - like levels. . 
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:42:56
They can't. The UI is complicated enough for Bitcoin alone. Same thing goes for implementing SC's and LN.

Because of your blinders, you can't see that I've just described several of them.

thanks for linking to a post where i got 65 upvotes!

that this arbitrary limited mempool "fee mkt" is not a mkt at all; it's an inefficient blind auction that requires users to pay more than necessary due to grossly limited information (no bitcoinfees.com doesn't count) and causes them delays and frustrations to the point where they leave.  this is inappropriate for a system that claims it is **money**, which by any reasonable person's definition is supposed to be widely accepted, fluid, liquid, instant, fast, and yes, inexpensive.  many *potential* companies have openly stated that they have decided not to use Bitcoin b/c of the limited/capped/controlled 2TPS.
but that's ok, i know you'll never admit it.  you can have your fork.

I'm in my phone so can't and won't for such a lazy, purposefully ignorant guy. Why don't you link me to where Satoshi said no blocksize increase? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 12:52:02
I've read that thread before many times. Everyone already knows he put the 1mb limit in place as a temporary measure. You're not teaching anything new here. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:20:15
Why do you want to cripple bitcoin at 2tps? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:40:10
2 more weeks... 
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:23:14


oh c'mon. What about all the secret meetings, filters scaling conferences, exclusive social events, HK backdoor agreements, expulsion of Gavin, Hearn, garzik from core dev, the banning of thousands from this sub &amp; BCT. Greg spends most of his time on r/btc.

Oh, so you know better than an academic paper published by Professor of Computer Science, Emin Gun Sirer, of Cornell University with solid statistical results based on actual math, not bullshit like yours? In fact, don't forget who else has determined that 4mb is just fine, your core dev gods pwuille &amp; gmax. Why do you think the max blocksize is 4mb for SWSF? 
@_date: 2016-10-10 13:55:32
Eth doesn't apply here because it is a smart contracting system, not money, has no network effect, a premine, and centralized.

I don't think he is happy about the response to his tweet yesterday. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:45:08
You seriously believe that you're not fundamentally changing bitcoin with SW? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:03:26
Haha troll. Obvious is obvious. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:29:56
dude, it's ok.  you'll never understand, we get it.
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:18:08
I never claimed volatility is for me. I'm just acknowledging a known fact about the Bitcoin market. And as an early adopter, I've long since stopped speculating anymore as I believe bitcoin has successfully crossed the Rubicon. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 17:35:02
you refuse to see what you don't want to see :)
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:33:10
Doesn't look good 
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:01:17
And you can't be bothered to really give a shit when I say I'm on my phone. I have plenty of Satoshi links on my PC where he advocates bigger blocks. I'll provide them later. And seriously, would it even matter around here when I do? No. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:37:30
That's why you let it grow unfettered 
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:40:20
Bye, bye, Blockstream. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 15:54:31
Lol, is that all you got? I DO line volatility, as it presents trading opportunities. But at this point, I certainly don't need it or depend on it. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:51:03
Gold is only valued because everyone on the planet values/covets it. I don't see the same for Bitcoin, do you? 
@_date: 2016-10-16 16:44:47
stream of what?  LN hubs?
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:19:25
You're stating the obvious. The other half of its greatest strength is the SOV properties. But it needs to be usable in a global basis for maximum decentralization. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 22:00:44
The MW description makes it sound like it should be ideal for large and small anonymous tx's. Why not? 
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:09:06
Hodl some coin and you'll easily be able to afford running a full node.
