Alright I'll pull my guess out of my ass. I think we see a big run up, or another "bubble" starting now and ending in July sometime, maybe early August. I think we could have a peak of anywhere between 1,000 and 5,000 and then crashing down and leveling off at between 700 and 2,250.

Mining right now is not very profitable, and could very easily be less and less profitable as time goes on. 
It's probably best to simply buy bitcoin

Are TV companies going out of business right now as prices are declining? No. 
Nothing wrong with hoarding or saving. Saving money stimulates the economy as well. Saving and Spending should work together in an ideal economy.
Ideally interest rates would be free from government manipulation and allowed to operated freely. So if people are "hoarding" all their money, then the banks have plenty to lend out, which lowers interest rates, because money is easy to come by, so more people can borrow said money and thus your magic phrase of "stimulating the economy" is fulfilled. Plus, interest rates low allow for the engagement of long term projects which is good, because the average person is saving his money so he can spend more later! Matches wonderfully. 
Same reversed. If nobody is saving their money, then banks wont have much to lend out. So the cost of money (interest rates) should be higher. Which is good, because with high interest rates business will not be engaging in long term projects due to cost. Why is that good? Because the people have told the economy, by not saving, that they want to spend now and not later. It matches up wonderfully.
Unfortunately we have government manipulated interest rates so they are artificially low. So we have nobody saving, but the cost of borrowing is still low for the sake of "stimulating" the economy now. It's not only pointless, it's harmful.

Now is an okay time to buy but not the best. Right now it's a hair over 700. At exactly 4:38 am EST on February 13 it will dip into the high 500s with a low of 586. you'll then want to sell everything when it peaks at exactly 7:09 pm on March 28th. At that time it will hit 1,710. That will be the last time over 1700 for about 22 weeks so take advantage of it. 
After these moves are made be sure to make another thread here and I will have more answers for you.

But in this economy, that we currently live in, A tv will cost far less a year from now. which by your logic, means today, nobody will buy TVs because they can get a better one or a cheaper one next year. Is this the case?

Go all in now! Tomorrow at this time it will be 620!! But make sure you sell at 623.50. This is where we will head down again. buy back all in on July 10th when we hit the bottom of 558.94. From there its straight up to $783.13  which is the price you need to sell at on July 22nd. Goes down for a little bit and then the perfect time to buy back in will be the morning (between 8am-9am sometime) of the 6th of August which will hit $647.28. That should last you till about September 2nd. 
Or its also possible that people dont know the future.

The answer from RME suffices.  I just wanted to add that the private key is the one and only thing you or another person needs to access all of the bitcoin associated with it. Make sure you keep the paper wallet in a safe location.

If I gave you a bitcoin and said you could eat this month, or eat three times as much in a few months, would you choose not to eat?
Also your TV example is a poor one, as TV's have gotten cheaper and cheaper while improving in quality through the years. I bought a 42" TV just a few months ago because I wanted a TV. I know that a year from now it will be much cheaper though.

It is absolutely not a legitimate concern.
The use of cash in illegal activity is well documented (much moreso than bitcoin) and its not a concern with cash. 
Just because some people have decided to use the most efficient form of money out there now for illegal purposes should be of no concern whatsoever. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:59:01
Well that's certainly a possibility. BUT my opinion is that the best way to "invest" in bitcoin is to buy and hold and don't worry about the day to day movements. 
My first buy was at an all time high at about 45 dollars per btc. I was frustrated because I was watching it for months before and reading about it while the price was so much lower. Now that difference isn't that big of a deal.
People will wait too long and miss out. But it won't be because they took an extra few days to research and research.

The point of a paper wallet is to make sure the private keys are never online. Paper wallets should be used as a savings account that you dont touch. If you need to touch it then import the entire wallet into an online one amd never re use the same paper wallet. You should have a seperate wallet through an app on your phone for typical use if you want. In this you shouldnt have much. Probably about as much as the amount of cash you would be comfortable carrying.

Your wallet is simply the two keys. The public and private. In order to receive bitcoin send to public key. In order to spend from the paper wallet you can import the wallet using the private key into an online wallet that you have. Many clients have this ability including blockchain.info and electrum and others. But remember once you spend from the paper wallet, you shouldnt use the same one again.

Best Buy is a good idea. They should want to appease the tech crowd. I sent in a post on their idea forum so now the last one was like 5 minutes ago. 
I agree with you that we need more organization, and more focus on gaining a wider acceptance. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:12:34
We don't 
But competition isn't bad. Bitcoin is clearly winning that and I don't expect litecoin to succeed 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:52:22
You don't math, do ya
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:12:21
haha seriously. Don't wake the beast! Let it stabilize for God's sake!
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:10:33
What is it youre trying to do? Send bitcoin to the address? Or just make sure it is a valid address, or what?
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:13:27
Lets say there are 100 billion keys with funds in them. (obviously not that many, but we will go with it)
Now pick a number between 1 and 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:10:50
I do buy at strange times. I live in South Korea! Haha
But yea. I guess ill just keep at it. Its just a little annoying that every time i try to buy the value goes up a whole dollar!
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:25:33
Were all ready for your alternative..
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:30:11
Is there nothing we can do about this shit?

6 people
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:08:23
Oh my God. I don't know what to do.. OP hasn't told me where we are on the graph yet...
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:29:26
An offline paper wallets private key should never be available on a network. You can use a program like bitaddress.org to generate wallets. (Public key and Private Key pairings). Look up how to do this safely offline. 
get a handful of wallets. Write them down carefully, or print them on a dumb printer. 
Never put the private key online anywhere. Send bitcoin to the public key. Then store that paper with the private key in a safe place. Possibly multiple safe places. 
If the time comes you wish to spend those coins, you need to import the entire wallet into an online client. Once you spend (importing) a paper wallet you are done with that particular one. Never use it again. 
There is more info out there. Keep researching!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:51:14
If you plan to buy and hold because you believe in it and see the huge potential for what it may be YEARS down the road? Yea. I added added small amount to my position this morning. 
I am by no means a day trader and don't try to time the market. I bought at 256 at the peak in April and had to wait 6 months before it saw that price again. I may buy at the perfect moment, I may buy at the tippy top of one of the many peaks. Haven't really sold any and have no regrets. I'm loving the ride!
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:44:09

Question from a non-miner..
Does the increase in this difficulty, or future increases in difficulty, hurt the incentive to mine? And if so, what are the effects of that?
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:27:17
Its hard enough predicting what the price will be an hour from now.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:04:31
I'm sure someone will send you 1BTC any second. Just wait

Well heres a different topic...
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:39:39
Bitcoin is not a company
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:36:11
Yes. Sell your house, buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:21:38
See. I was thinking 8.. Nothing to worry about. 
But really.. Nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:51:01
I know a guy whos brother used to live in korea which is pretty close to china. Hes says bitcoin is cool
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:15:53
Just wait till this corrects though. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:38:49
It's how I live my life!
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:34:18
Okay i see. Thanks!
Will it ever get to a point where this becomes a real problem and most miners have to stop? Pardon my ignorance. Im a newbie (who just bought my first coins!!) 
@_date: 2013-06-20 11:20:38
Yup. Thats where I stopped reading
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:37:46
Wow. A spread is usual, but this is crazy..
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:51:30
I think you're wrong. But if you are not. I will be there to buy what those fools are selling
@_date: 2013-06-15 12:57:13
yea. it wasnt that long ago
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:13:30

Only the total number is correct. So when it says 51 upvotes 12 downvotes. Total=39 pts. It could be 39/0, 40/1, 839/800, or whatever
@_date: 2013-06-03 09:27:26
I think i agree. I live in south korea where a us dollar is equal to about 1100 korean won. They seem to like it much better and dont understand why we use decimals in our money.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:36:16
...then dont buy from there. Its obvious that its this way because right now, people are willing to spend that there
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:28:22
Close. It was actually 6. We were looking for 6
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:32:40
Evil rich bastard!

which exchange?

This community is actually quite receptive to coherent and well thought out naysaying points. But this article is not that. It seems to make no actual points other than "bitcoin is just weird and must be a fad". 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:12:01
I understand economics, thanks though. 
If bitcoin was the only currency in the world, and we used this deflationary currency, one in which the value of you money goes up as time passes, it is not be a bad thing. It encourages saving over reckless spending, which is fine. 
"So why would anyone spend today when they could wait a month and that money is worth more?? "
Well, somehow I dont expect people saying "You know, Lets not buy burgers or anything to eat today.. this way we can afford steak next week!" People will still decide to consume now even if they can get more later. We see this in a lot of markets. People buy flat screen tvs, when they know the same tv will be much cheaper in a year. People buy the iPhone 5 the day its released instead of waiting till the 5 is much cheaper later. The economy still functions, and much better. 
So people are encouraged to save more than with a currency that continuously falls in value, like the US dollar. This signals to the economy that people feel its worth it to spend later, and they will actually have the funds to do it rather than borrow and borrow and borrow. 
Assuming this wonderful hypothetical situation where the us dollar does not exist we will say that we actually have free market interest rates. More saving in general will signal that the cost to borrow money (interest rates) will be cheaper because there is more money out there to be borrowed, and less borrowing it. Wonderful, now its cheap for entrepreneurs or businesses to invest in long term projects... say projects that might be ready for consumption..... a later time.. you know, when those savers are ready to spend.. Kinda works out perfectly, doesn't it? 
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:52:41
Thanks. Just got it cut today actually. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:42:40
Most look at bitstamps price. Coinbase is always very close to it as well
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:08:50
The first time I bought was $64 back during the last run up. I watched a lot when it was 12-15.. thought about getting in at 20. Finally started to get my coinbase account at 45..And by the time I was able to buy it was 64. 
I reluctantly bought even though it was higher than it had ever been. I was worried I was making a huge mistake, and was kicking myself for not getting in a few weeks eariler. 
Well we know the rest of that story. I have kept buying at a lot of different values. Including 245 on that famous April day. Never was able to buy back at the price I first did, the same price that I almost didn't pull the trigger, because it was so outrageously high!
If you buy now, it may be like when i bought at 60 and you'll love it. It may be like when I bought like a freaking week later at 245 and regretted it for the next 5 months. who knows. But I can say that I certainly don't regret buying at the peak in April anymore. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:35:04
Early investors in anything always see bigger returns than those who jumped in later. they take the bigger risk, and therefore reap bigger rewards if said investment succeeds. Whats terrible about early adopters benefiting more thank adopters who came in later?
In short, you're dumb
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:16:36
Not easy to be stable in such early adaption stages

You need to create an online wallet with blockchain. Once youre in there, there should be an option to import private keys. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:43:23
 I'm pulling for you by the way!
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:28:29
...uh.. because they aren't forcing you to buy through them
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:02:54
Easy answer for you here-- Dont mine bitcoin. Just dont. 
If you want to get in the bitcoin world then buy bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:19:40
I know! We just need a more efficient way to move currency around the world... 
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:04:31
Eventually, yes they could sit and test. 
Pick a number between 1 and 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976.
I've got one in mind. I'll give you as many guesses as you want
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:20:03
You could always store your paper wallet in a safety deposit box. Or give the thief one of your 20 wallets and call it a day. 
I also believe when bitcoin becomes more popular, bitcoin banks will exist for those who don't wish to have the full security burden on their own shoulders. Not sure exactly how it would work, but it doesn't seem like a terribly difficult idea. To offer a service with 100% offline storage protected. Who knows. But in the meantime, there are ways to handle the security yourself. Horrible people will always find ways around such measures. But there are definitely ways now to make it very freaking hard for them.. Luckily though, most people are good.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:34:12
Yes its very exciting! Its going to be a hell of a ride no matter where it goes. I'm glad to be a part of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:14:43
Did you contact coinbase support?
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:03:12
I think he doesn't know what a Ponzi scheme is. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:31:16
Clever. Have an upvote
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:53:26
Nobody knows. I'd say buy a fraction of the amount you want to put in every couple of days, or once a week. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:50:43
Why buy a flat screen tv today when the same one will be 100 dollars cheaper next year?   Oh thats right.. because you want stuff now..
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:10:46
I'd rather not see this shit on r/bitcoinmarkets
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:28:15
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:30:20
Holy shit.. why are there this many altcoins?
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:40:30
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:16:51
Maybe he meant "Buy, Buy Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:48:41
The community definitely needs to focus on stuff like this more. Talking to businesses, making a big fuss about bitcoin so they atleast begin to look into it! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:55:06
Why did you sell
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:29:56
I second this.
Not very many people have beat this strategy. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:41:34
Nope. I don't like this one. But it doesn't mean you should try again
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:42:06
Shit man. Sorry to hear. 840 bucks down the drain
@_date: 2013-06-09 10:52:56
added a couple as well. First time that I have bought at under $100 since march
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:50:50
Not buyin it
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:14:37
What he is saying is at the current value, he could hypothetically sell enough to cover the us dollar amount that he has bought in at. And keep whats left in bitcoin. The value of which would be pure profit
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:46:53
I use coinbase. Many others do with no issue and don't post about it. 
If you have a problem their support is willing to help. Most who do have an issue post here first rather than try and contact them. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:25:26
One US Senator doesn't understand what bitcoin is. Said it was so confusing that it will be used for terrorism. It made no sense, he is entirely ignorant on the subject, luckily most the other responses from other senators were on the positive side. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:03:51
Same here.
Bought at 64, 92, 115, 165, 245 all in during the april run up. Since then have nought at 100, and 125.
Havent sold one yet
Havent bought since the start of this current run up mostly because i have needed money for other things that came up, not because its going up to fast or that it is in a bubble or whatever. Because long long term it doesnt matter
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:22:57
Looks like you just did

Yes, but steadily!

It's about someone spending 91 bitcoins on a car. The title was sarcastic. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:30:25
A good way to get in is to buy a small amount of bitcoin. Do not try to mine. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:20:20
I'd definitely take that at this point. haha
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:23:05
Still waiting...
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:06:54
We still have $38 to go
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:59:41
I would absolutely recommend a portion of your savings going toward bitcoin. What that portion is, should be dependent on your own situation. 20% probably sounds good. That's what I did. 20% of my monthly savings... but it's not my fault if that became more than 90% of it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:10:08
Did you contact coinbase support?
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:56:17

@_date: 2013-12-13 21:11:50
Yes. All you need is the private key. You can derive the public address from the private key. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:20:12
Yep. I used to live in korea. News is sometimes in english, (although I didn't really watch Korean tv) Every kid takes extensive English lessons. 
I guess it's considered cool or high class to know English. People buy clothes with English words on them, restaurants have English words on the walls, it's kinda interesting. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:02:12
They say that a lot. It never lasts that long. Keep checking
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:50:56
Better sell! Hurry! Panic! NOW!
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:23:22
Well.. its not irrelevant.. It's kind of how you receive bitcoins.

Just hold on tight!
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:44:39
Alright so brain wallets are not secure because I cant be truly random. What about paper wallets? I run bitaddress.org offline to generate a public/private combo. Assuming that part is safe and offline, I can just write down on a piece of paper the private and public keys, or a couple of sets of keys and assuming no mistakes are made while writing it should be the exact same as your other option with all the usb sticks and whatnot? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:05:10
Congrats! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:09:16
They don't have to keep the bitcoin if they don't want to though. It's very easy for them to implement it with bitpay. Then they get us dollars. No problem. At this point they are just ignoring free money

Once more accept it, it will be better. Competition will fix it. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:13:38
Most likely nothing. But now your private key has been online so there is some risk there. Best to play it safe. 
Edit: also if you only spend a portion of it rather than importing the entire wallet the change could go to an address you dont control if you dont understand how change addresses work.

free markets always end in monopoly? Is this why i can only eat at one place? is this why i only have one choice when i buy a car? Or a TV? Is this why we all are forced to use the same cell phone service? 
even if your absurd thoughts on free markets were true..your solution to these monopolies is to solve this problem with government monopoly? 
edit: spelling
