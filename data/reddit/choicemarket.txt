Unless I'm mistaken, that means you'll pay your card company a ~3% cash advance fee (true for my credit card anyway). If so, seems that the fee problem is just being moved to the consumer rather than the merchant.

In order to hard-fork you need miner divergence... Exactly how many GH/s does Circle control?  Ah yes... None. 
And even if he could persuade miners to diverge, it would be  akin to him taking an enormous bazooka against his own foot and the feet of his financial backers.

If I had to guess why Bitcoin might be well bid today, I suspect the renewed fears over solvency of Portuguese banks might be bullish.  But then, a $15 swing used to just be bid-offer... :)

Mark, just a small follow up, I checked your AR01 filed with companies house on 7th May, which shows McCarthy as 23.19% shareholder.  I assume from your statement that he is  selling that stake?

Your choice of course, but the address is 3-of-5 multisig so you aren't placing trust only in Amir.
I'd suggest the merits of the project significantly outweigh any risks you may perceive to be caused by a publicly-known member participating in a distributed-trust project.

My problem is only with nefario, so if you have shed that bad actor then good luck to you.  If you happen to still be in touch with him I'm sure many people would appreciate their funds back. 
In such a hostile regulatory environment I prefer the relative anonymity and security of the OTC market place, but that doesn't mean an exchange will not be a useful stopgap until better distributed trading mechanisms become more mature.  Good luck.

Even if anyone is stupid enough to register their Bitcoin business in NY, I think you could get around that provision...
Just setup a separate (non-BitLicensed) limited company which solely holds Bitcoin, then invest all profits from the licensed entity into the holding company.  That way the licensed company does not have any retained earnings since the coins are reported as investments on its balance sheet / P&amp;L statement.

This would actually be a great viral marketing campaign for bitcoin...

Worth noting that their CTO is nefario (recently removed from their website), the founder of GLBSE which was hacked several times and arbitrarily closed in a botched operation resulting in the loss of Bitcoin to many users,  myself included. Personally, not going to trust these guys with a penny...
