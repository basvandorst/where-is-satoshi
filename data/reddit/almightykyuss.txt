It's only going to reach more momentum the more value it has.

Ok, so how would they *stop* crypto currencies? Turn off all the nodes, around the entire fucking planet? Maybe somehow create a super-virus bug that can crash the targeted networks? 
The creation of bitcoin was designed and if I am wrong someone please correct me, but it was designed in mind for the inability for market control and wealth visibility.
They can't shut it down, and I will tell you why - because they have already tried. It's the web, it's a deep web. They have already tried, it's not like there are Geneva laws on the execution of a network or currency exchange, there are no rules on the web. So in hindsight, they have already tried or someone has already attempted to gain control of the market, otherwise, we wouldn't be talking about it right now.

The *seizure*, how - you still have not explained **how**. Trivial to banks perhaps to operate on their extension of networks, simply deny the transaction of acceptance of a Bitcoin, but that doesn't simply stop the Bitcoins *value*. So long as there is a single digit of worth to Bitcoin, it will grow and flux on its own market, Bitcoin was designed for the sole intention of NOT needing banks. Perhaps some have forgotten that.

The question is *how*, not what to do - how to do it is the question

Can someone explain to me what ETF is?

Ok gotcha. But, bitcoin is such a fast lane trading environment. Wouldn't that be counterproductive?
