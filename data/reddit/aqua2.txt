Where can I find the total weekly sales of bitcoin?

I'm sorry to all of you who lost money. I've been a day trader for a few years and I know how it feels to lose so much. 
I actually came perilously close to buying 10 BTC @ $400 back in November of last year. I had opened the account with GOX, made the transfer and all. Turns out the transaction never happened for some reason (likely that I miscommunicated my bank account info)....thank freaking god. I would've been out of $4000 in just 3 months.

Too bad it's not illegal since there are no regulations.

Those will be a problem when BTC is trading at 100 billion USD

I hear buttercoin will be convertible with upvotes.

What's your USD cost basis per BTC?

That's not a good thing. You guys don't want investment bankers with billions of dollars in leverage coming anywhere near bitcoin, which as of right now is completely unregulated.
Bitcoin's biggest problem is that its "investors" are hoarding it for value; they're not using it to buy or sell anything. This is not what bitcoin is about. We don't want BTC to become like beanie babies, right?!

Wow...Reddit has sunk really, really low in its Apple hatred. 
This is quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever seen on this website. And it certainly doesn't reflect well on the Bitcoin community.

Reminds me of all the well regarded market analysts who said Apple would hit $1000 back in 2012.

Bitcoin is like an OTC penny stock. It's a security (or rather a commodity since the SEC doesn't recognize it as a security) that has no fundamentals and trades at the whims of jittery, misinformed retail investors.
If you go on investorshub.com and click on the message board for any given penny stock, you'll see the same level of denial as you see here about the negative press...only at least over there, the negative press (though it forms the minority of posts) doesn't get downvoted to the point where it's never seen by the community.
In that sense, is the absolute WORST place for a trader/investor of bitcoin to be spending their time, and this silly gif perfectly represents what's going on right now.
I'm not saying the sky is falling (in fact, if I were a gambling man I'd buy BTC now), but the attitude of people here doesn't exactly lend any confidence to the stability and/or legitimacy of bitcoin.
I've been an investor and day trader (though mostly an investor) since the scary days of 2008, and even then I saw cooler heads in the market!

What a crock of shit...
Are your really using generic libertarian tripe to justify not having consumer protection laws? Get your head checked man. 
And just because one high profile criminal wasn't caught by authorities doesn't mean we should scrap all regulations...this is one of the worst anti-regulation arguments I have ever heard.

wow...I don't think I pay a dime to my bank in anything other than a few FX transactions. Most of my purchases are on my CC, for which I don't pay fees and get about $400 annually in travel rewards, no ATM fees, no withdraw/transaction fees if I keep my balance over a certain amount, and no debit fees. 
Didn't know European banks were that brutal...and to think American customers gave BofA the business when they announced the debit card fees...crazy! You guys need to complain more!

Serious question guys...my parents live in a country that has draconian caps on money transfer. Seeing this pic made me wonder if we can just exchange money online easily with bitcoin. 
How liquid is bitcoin? I understand it's easy to buy bitcoin (it's just like buying equities, right? ), but is it easy to cash it out quickly? How does it work exactly if you're with Mt. Gox for example?
I suppose I can buy some bitcoin, have my dad buy it from me, then he can sell it on the open market and cash out...any thoughts?
