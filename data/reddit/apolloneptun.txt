Wirh bitcoin its more profitable to hold than spend. Everybody who bought pre 2017 smth with bitcoin regrets it. My buddy trsded cs skibs for btc and had 2500 btc at a point not worth much but he sold it all for nothing and is suicidal now because of it
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:16:31
Bullshit. Bitcoin is far more risky. Bitcoin lost 70% not 7%
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:58:16
Btc gets outperformed by everyone else anyway
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:27:28
This only works in hyperinflations like Venezuela not a little inflation.
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:49:10
Thats because you think bitcoin is a currency, which it isnt. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:12:56
It will have a user friendly wallet in less than 4 weeks(trinity). And to your point the current wallet functions fine if someone is able to educate themselves on it. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:45:28
Well im nkt here for 9 more years so i dont care. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:57:48
No btc value doesnt come from being good at buying things like fiat is. It comes from being independet of states and groups cant control it. Its value isnt measured in how fast you can buy things. Its a hedge against states.

Im talking about businesses investing in anything. Like production facility, staff and so on. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:54:39
lmao wtf never ever
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:08:26
Btc holders salty because theyre not making money lol.
Iota is as far from a shitcoin as it can get.
I dont think multi billion dollar companies partner with scammers. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:09:51
Yeah but btcs tech is at the moment absolutely not suitable to be adopted as a currency by millions of people. Neither is iota or any other crypto. But having some really talented people and companies collaborating to work on iota is more promising than the btc community effort.
Just wait until the 3rd of june and if the iota foundation is the first to have figured out oracles, thats a really good advantage.
As they say in crypto "massively"

When snapshot for the airdrop/fork? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:36:06
And you idiots think if everybody would just use bitvoin in their economy, no problems? Lmao. With bitcoin theres no incentive to spend, and the econony collapses, btc is no solution. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:18:41
Strohman Argument buddy, if i had made one trade and thats it, id agree with you. But over the last 6 months i have made 264 trades on bitfinex. No amount of sustained luck could get me such a high successrate. Youre just ignorant.
TA doesnt work because of magic, it works because everybody uses th same system, its the selffulfilling prophecy. Easy as that. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:48:17
It did fail to capture adoption in less than 10 years didnt it? Thats why OP post doesnt make any sense. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:04:18
OP is stupid and inaccurate, but TA still does work. I managed a 75% increase in my portfolio from January to now. How did that work if my ta didnt work? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:34:18
And btc is 10 years old and already failed.... Nobody needs btc. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:42:59
"use" it, yes as a speculative asset. None of them buy anything with btc except drugs lol
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:19:56
Put in 20k now worth 50k. Yore doing it wronh. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:43:01
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:23:08
Yeah or just buy some iota and dont participate in the dips. Buy it between 1-1.10 and youll never be at a loss. Come at me. I bet everyone of you to it.
I know you are all triggered now but iota already bottomed out earlier than other cryptos compare the charts, when btc drops further iota doesnt go with it under a dollar. Research it. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:38:05
They are not at all tanking buddy. Look at the charts only thing tanking is your btc.
And i wont sell my iota,ill sell them to you at 50$ when you finally realize what they are good for. After you get the proof with every iot company using it. Have fun. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:13:07
So capitulation then? Nice almost bottom 
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:29:13
Wanted to comment the same lol
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:38:46
Thats how you get rekt lol
Have fun buying from me at 12000
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:28:10
Yeah me too
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:42:39
Nope lol. Never owned any btc.
Except short contacts at 15k
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:01:27
Because 99% of people in crypto are dudes. Are you a banana then? Or an Apache hekicopter as gender?
How should we answer your Statement i cant read youre not a dude. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:40:29
Because Btc sucks balls. I hope it goes to zero. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:33:53
No he wont.
@_date: 2018-04-12 08:17:20
Youre pathetic. And your mining isnt profitable. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:41:20
Yeah but even if it goes 10k he wont regret sellong. He traded his setup and didnt get bogged down by fear and risking his profits for a little more. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:51:29
I didnt regret shorting 15k
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:04:41
100$ a day is nothing lol only 3k a month. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:20:09
Is this even same guys? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:02:29
Youre delusional. But thats ok will you buy mine for 20.000.000 $? I suspect no. So you would pay 8800$? Oh ok so its worth that. Good.
