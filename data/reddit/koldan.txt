The only problem is, that most of these places are kind of expensive. I guess they aim for the rich audience. It would be nice to see some cheap food places to accept Bitcoin.

Would it be possible to use some bill payment service? I mean those, where you pay for someone else in bitcoins and they have fiat that they use to pay your bills.

I bet it would be a funny joke in UK to put a USB drive with random data to somebody's pocket and then tell police it's an encrypted terrorist plan.

A little offtopic: What's wrong with public schools? All of my education is from public schools. From the first grade to university.

Storing Bitcoins might make bookkeeping a little bit harder. At least in Finland it's a little bit more complex that way.

Umm.. Sorry, I expressed myself badly. What I meant was, when you are doing bookkeeping and annual tax report and have Bitcoins there, it makes things a little bit harder.

There is a [shooting club at Helsinki that accepts Bitcoin]( so I guess all gun loving people are already "catched" :)

At first they were actually very skeptic against Bitcoin, and there was [kind of big debate about this (in finnish) at their FB page]( It was interesting to notice, that they didn't knew there was services like Bitpay. And after some people mentioned about this, they clearly changed their attitude. So whenever you spread Bitcoin propaganda and ask shops if they accept Bitcoin, remember to also mention that they can still receive fiat if they want :)

Unfortunately no :(

Because porn industry is selling digital material, which can be copied infinite times, it could use constant Bitcoin prices, instead of those derived from fiat currencies. Do you think this kind of arrangement would stabilize the exchange rates? I mean, if rate would drop, then Bitcoin users could get cheaper porn, which might result to more people buying coins to get porn and if rate would raise, then the effect would be opposite.
Of course this would mean that the porn seller should hodl his coins instead of dumping them immediately for fiat. Also the seller should be some kind of Bitcoin believer, because this would definitely not be clever from business perspective.. But it might be good for Bitcoin :)
