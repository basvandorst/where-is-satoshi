Wouldn't it have made more sense to make a self post and update that instead of having us sort the comments out?

Writing articles for reddit karma.  For shame!  :p

If you formatted the message in a standard format in the blockchain then it would be easy to parse for a 3rd party site to maintain listings.  Having it in the blockchain would also allow businesses to sign their acceptance of bitcoin whereas just submitting it to the site via a form is something anybody could do for any business which could lead to a business being added or removed without their knowledge.
What do you mean that the blockchain is significantly more expensive?  That's not something I have a lot of knowledge of.

If I had wanted or want to get paid in Google stock I could have just bought Google stock myself with my normal paycheck.

You're not salting your password as others have said.  You're doing something more like "applying an algorithm to alter the initial passphrase".  Not as short as 'salt' though.
If you obtain a users salt and password, you can then get the hash yes.  In general the point of salts is that the user knows the password and the system knows the salt and the hash.  The user sends their password (usually hashed) to the server.  The server combines the password/hashed password with the salt and hashes it and compares it against the hash in the database.  Since each user has a unique salt each users hash is unique even if their passwords are the same.  This means if the database is stolen (a hacker gets the salts and hashes), they can't go "Well 'password' is the most common password and this hash 'abcjdiashfuiadshfuads' is the most common hash in this database, so there is a high likelyhood that users with that hash used that password.  Instead each instance of 'password' will have a random 'uj8rgjnfdsjgnfdsk' or 'fjdiasojfidoas' or 'fjd89safj382qnjfka' tacked onto the end thus giving them each a unique hash.

Bitcoin is an alternate solution yes.  But for the masses, Apple Pay is a simpler solution.  They take their current credit card(s), take pictures of them, and done.  They were already likely going to buy a new iPhone anyway.  Additionally there is massive popular retail adoption so it will get used more often.

Yes I know.  But this quote is almost 20 years old and was invalid probably 10 years ago, before Bitcoin.  It's easy to take quotes from a long while back and point out they didn't happen.  It's not very interesting or useful to IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:19:38
Why should we move on from the one thing that's currently having the most effect on the price of Bitcoin at the moment?  If you don't like it, block gox via RES.

I understand the article gets people riled up to be anti-bank, but what does that have to do with Bitcoin?


@_date: 2014-07-29 18:09:24
Because I didn't know if it was feasible or not, or useful or not.  It appears that it probably isn't useful.  I thought it might be interesting to store bitcoin accepting businesses in the same location as the transactions but brought up some good points.  This was more of an post.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:24:59
Great, now that you've subscribed we have to redo the numbers.

When did I say the rest of the world doesn't matter?  Maybe back up a few paces and better state what you disagree with in what I wrote.  I very well might agree with you.  But making things up won't get us very far.  I may not be as well versed in this topic as you are.  A better phrasing might be "your statement x isn't applicable in the majority of the world."

What's the difference between doing this and cashing out my bitcoin to fiat and storing it under my mattress until I want to buy back in to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:11:38
Unless the price is being super volatile that day, what's the difference between this and just buying and selling as needed on Coinbase or similar services?
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:40:55
Surely dogecoin is the top dog of crypto.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:20:31
I didn't state it was innovative.  It will simply be adopted quicker than Bitcoin since it is easier for the masses to use than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-31 06:36:38
You'll never fix ths typo!
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:03:49
What is the benefit of being paid in Bitcoin?  If you cash out right away it seems like an extra step and leaving it in seems to leave your paycheck up to the volatility of the currency.  Of course you can cash out 90% of your paycheck and leave 10% to play the charts but then why not just set up an autobuy?
I get it being good for bitcoin, I don't get why it's good for the employee and I figure somebody here can clear that up for me.
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:10:56
Thanks for the information.  I do appreciate it and understand the points you raise.  My main reasoning behind it was I thought it would be interesting to store bitcoin accepting businesses in the same place as the transactions are done.
While possibly feasible, it seems like it's probably not useful.  Just because something might be interesting, doesn't mean it's useful and I can accept that!
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:56:04
That would be silly.  Doesn't it need to be discussed?  Plus people will just circumvent it if they want to talk about it.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:45:47
I think it means they can choose to but they need to get a BitPay account and get it hooked up.  It doesn't mean everybody that uses PayPal Payment Hub just gets Bitcoin acceptance turned on.

There's a typo in your fix.  Not sure if intentional or....
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:04:24
You can already do this by using your local bank.  If I have $1,000 of bitcoin I can convert it to $1,000 and store it in my bank (and get a smidge of interest).  Then at any time I can take that $1,000 and buy bitcoin and get a happy meal with my interest.
I don't see how this service benefits the consumer at all or isn't already provided.  Instead of you getting the minor interest, Coinapult gets the combined interest from the funds 'we' leave with them.

If I buy $1,000 in goods the day after payday from a company using BTC, then the company waits 13 days to pay their employee, that $1,000 in BTC might be worth $600.  Of course it could also be worth $1,400.  I don't know if the company would be willing to hold it that long.  Sounds like it'd make more sense to sell immediately and rebuy when needed unless the company was willing to play the market.

Very cool to see this sub grow.  It's been nice to be able to find concentrated information on Bitcoin here and been very informative to me towards understanding Bitcoin and consequently buying my first bits of Bitcoin.  I even have a recurring buy set up these days!
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:17:49
It also doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin.  This prediction was wrong before Bitcoin.

According to Coinbase I can do $1,000 a week instantly.

You're about $0.0068 invested in it now... better cash out now while the price is up.

Up until yesterday I hadn't bought any BTC for this reason.  In my head I thought, "I can't afford $1,000+ investment!".  Finally I talked myself into that I could afford a $100 investment.  Now I have .1 BTC.  It's not much but it's mine!  All mine!  'Splitting' to mBTC would be great I think.
