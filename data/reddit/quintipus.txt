I took it that he was very pro-Bitcoin, but also aware of the sound-bite objections to Bitcoin as a means of being anonymous and evil. It is certainly possible to use bitcoin without anonymity.  Is he not referring to the use of bitcoin with accounts that have names and other credentials associated with them? Perhaps I'm naive, but this seems positive. Clearly, if bitcoin is to come into widespread use, names (and often addresses) will have to be known under many circumstances. Other info won't need to be known, though, so identity theft wouldn't be the problem it is as with credit/debit cards.

But wait: Isn't it anonymous enough that we don't know who hacked Bitstamp, for example?

I am surprised Coinbase doesn't feel like it would be a reasonable thing to send an email to their blog or customer base to warn people that the email is not legitimate.

Unfortunately, it does capture the idea in a quick sentence, because we're aware of the stereotype of women -- especially women of earlier generations -- being incapable of understanding math or physics or anything "technical."  I admit, it works for me too. But I want it to stop working, and it feels wrong when I hear it. The message it sends to young women and girls comes off harmful, and I wish we could get over telegraphing these messages to girls, who are just as capable as anyone, and don't deserve this question mark hovering like a balloon being tossed around over their heads.  Does it not work to say something like, "Even my grandparents can do it..." ? Because it's really the generation leap that causes people to stumble, mostly. And also the gaps between subcultures in our current society, regardless of gender.

No, it does not defeat the purpose entirely. Being "untraceable," "anonymous," and so on, are media sound-bites that are inaccurate.  One of the main points is, for example, that bitcoin is not produced or controlled by the US Treasury or the Federal Rerserve.
