Fair. I think the point is that the currency we use in the near future will be based on trust, much like the United States’s issued currency is. Would we trust Facebook’s libra? No. China’s cryptocurrency? Maybe enough might be forced to use it that it replaces the USD considering it has more features. As someone who owns bitcoin not necessarily as an investment, but as sovereign individual, I trust and prefer BTC over any institution, be it government or corporation. That is more valuable than the USD value, to me. 
Am I making sense?

It was “Traditional Banks and FinTechs, how do they co-exist?” (or similar) at a conference.

Well, according to twitter, “ok boomer” is already dated and being used by corporations. I played myself

I’m 40. He may have been younger. The meme has been about responding to cynicism of the future. Although after thinking about the comments, I have come to agree that’s it is an ageist thing to say. The short term context explanation really isn’t an acceptable excuse.

Ageism is real and a major issue at the workplace and in western society in general. I do agree there is ageist undertones. I would argue that it’s become a meme response to anything cynical said about the future. I’ve heard 30 somethings say it to 20 somethings in conversation more than once. 
But, i must ultimately agree with you. The whole premise is ageist.

I’m a child of the sixties generation. My kids have seen the Woodstock documentary (plays every Sunday morning at our house) more than any cartoons or kids shows.
“okay boomer” is a meme response for when anyone says something cynical about the future. The response was not even to a boomer. I can see how this will age ageist though.

Never too late! TBH, I diversified with gold as well. 
Yeah, you make sense on trusting the people behind BTC. I guess I look at BTC more of a protocol, like TCP/IP, without centralized governance. We have two main internets now, the one we’re on and China’s (Russia has a 3rd?). BTC to me is the (potential) value layer of our internet. Damned if it’s gonna be our or any nation state government or corporation.
