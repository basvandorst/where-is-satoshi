Meanwhile she is the only candidate who has mentioned it which tells me that her team of advisors do know what they are talking about.

Hey, Sebastian,  I see you took the time to remove your name from the email which leads me to believe you don't want your name out there.  Except that you forgot to remove it from the header in shot 4.  Just a heads up.

My Coinbase iOS app updated today to a new version.  I had to exit it and re-enter it a few times to get it working but it is working fine now.

It looks like you have trouble abstracting yourself from what you know and looking at this from the position of someone less educated on the subject.  I am very good at this and I can see how his analogy works for the situation and how it does no long term harm.  You just look petty but maybe you just don't see it and maybe it is not intentional.  I doubt it though!
@_date: 2016-06-28 19:11:48
Rand Paul is no longer a candidate.
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:46:48
This isn't that unusual, what is unusual is an exchange putting something like this out there in a way that will cause panic in the market.
  
Anyways, there is a new block now.
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:29:14


  
What is not feasible about trying to educate the masses about the subject of bitcoin and its blockchain?  Prove that negative.

I will express myself how I want within the rules of this sub.  If I don't like a service, I will complain about it.  In this particular case I think breadwallet is shit!
@_date: 2016-06-29 17:32:27
It is shit because not having a choice how to display my balance is SHITTY!  The dev is deciding for me and I have decided I don't like that and refuse to use their shit product.  And I am so annoyed by it that I will express my feelings in public whenever I get the chance.  Fuck breadwallet and their shitty wallet that limits my choices.
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:28:07
No, you have no point, because it is an analogy.  He is not writing a white paper.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:09:09
It's a temporary thing in the event there is a denial of service attack, it doesn't have any long term implications because the gas limit will go back up after the fork.  This is just FUD.
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:25:54
With monero, your inputs are chosen at *random* for obfuscation.  Right now the last big thing is transaction amounts, you can still see those until they are hidden(coming soon).  So it might be possible to trace your activity based on amounts.  I'm not convinced this is feasible and I think the time it takes to convert to monero on Polo then send to your own wallet then send to shapeshift is probably enough.  But if you are alright with exposing yourself to more price movements waiting certainly won't hurt.  Once it is in your own monero wallet, you could do a bunch of smaller transactions to shapeshift making it even harder to spot yours.

XEM is a pump and dump.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:32:58
I don't think that is right but I may be wrong, in the end it doesn't matter, the attack would only last until block 1800000 at which time miners would stop lowering the gas limit.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:47:15
This isn't that type of baseless speculation is more suited to that sub.
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:23:28


  
Then you say this:
  


  
Which is exactly what you just accused him of.  In the end it is just an analogy to help people understand a situation, it doesn't need to be completely accurate, it just needs to convey information that helps people who don't understand the subject very well to understand it a little better.  It is flawed because he is speaking to a flawed populace who doesn't understand the subject.  You are ranting about nothing and being a hypocrite in the process.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:23:17
It still costs the attacker money, money we have no proof that they have, it just costs less right now.  And the threat immediately goes away after block 1800000 so it really is a non-issue.
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:23:54
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:42:26
You're talking jurisdiction, I am talking governing law, feel free to bring a case in your local jurisdiction but save a few jurisdiction that I can think of it will be governed by BVI law because that is what you agreed to.

I haven't seen that before.  I find it interesting that his Libertarian counterpart Jill Stein answered the same as Clinton.

That's not bitcoin, that's a useless metal token.  You can buy them in bulk for pennies from China.
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:15:42
NO!  Monero is the main thing breaking the chain of custody here.  Otherwise it is just a few extra subpoenas for law enforcement.
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:57:01
It looks like you don't know how blockchain.info works.  They don't have your keys, you have your keys, so OP didn't "gave someone else his coins to mind".  He had his keys the whole time and failed to manage them properly.  The OPs computer is likely compromised or they used a computer that was.  This is not the fault of blockchain.info.
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:29:35
This guy should hang out with Jaden Smith.
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:07:34
Math aside, it happens from time to time and has been happening since the first block was mined so it is not unusual.  The bitfinex person put this out there with no explanation like it was something to worry about and that can only cause more questions and panic from people who aren't aware.  Super irresponsible if you ask me.
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:12:52
You should have known breadwallet was shit when it was made to only allow you to use the denomination of bits.  I don't have a problem with bits but a wallet trying to force people to use it is going to try other shit too and here you have it.
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:24:41
Now you're just acting like an idiot, I like it better when you are actually being one.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:49:18
I have and you should too: 
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:35:19
Cool story.
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:49:52
He is a candidate but he has not mentioned blockchains to the best of my knowledge.  Accepting bitcoin for campaign contributions is not the same as advocating for it in your policies.  But it is certainly a good sign!
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:25:44
Except with blockchain.info you do own the keys.  
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:06:14
It is.
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:57:24
That's nice:
  


@_date: 2016-06-28 17:20:13
No.  The gas limit is being lowered as a trigger for the soft fork.  As soon as block 1800000 hits they can stop lowering the gas limit and things will return to normal. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 17:33:41
Your submission title is misleading, Coinbase did respond.  He told you it would take 4 days for a decision and 2 days for review and you literally ignored it and asked him for more than he told you he could give.  I would ignore you too.

Meh.  That dollar is bound to be worth more than a dollar over time.  Their loss.

His analogy regarding starbucks and the blockchain works for conveying his point of view.  I don't happen to agree with his view on blocks but I take issue when people attack people for trying to educate.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:43:04
1) Send to Poloniex from Coinbase  
2) Convert to Monero on Polo then send to your own Monero wallet that you control  
3) Shapeshift your Monero back to Bitcoin using shapeshift.io  
4) Don't have loose lips
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:55:57
That's not true.  The only reason the attack is viable is because miners are currently enforcing an artificially low gas limit to trigger the soft fork.  There is no reason to lower the gas limit after block 1800000 so miners will stop and the gas limit will rise back to normal and this attack will cost more money.
@_date: 2016-06-28 23:26:00
You are likely compromised.  I would use different two factor schemes for your accounts after re-installing everything and starting over. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:05:19
I didn't recommend Dash because I am not that familiar with it.  I like monero because it puts control in my hands and I don't have to rely on an exchange to shed the information that can connect the various transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:20:46
You should familiarize yourself with:

According to your screenshot used Debit Card to buy which is 3.75% fee.  Since you are accumulating for the long run, you should use ACH at 1% and wait 5 days to get your coins.
  
You can find their fee breakdown here:

If that's bothering you then life online must be rough for you.
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:58:12
Right, and I already tried your suggestion years ago and nothing changed.  So now I will just complain.
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:27:29
*Some not all.
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:38:47
His arguments is perfectly coherent, I think there is some bias in the way on your part.  He was expressing himself to the masses, not a group of experts on the subject. 
  
So back to your negative, you implied he is on a path that is not feasible.  What is not feasible?  Trying to use analogies to describe issues with the blockchain, what? 
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:34:24
I'm aware of that.  
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:52:01
How did I mis-characterize it?  He used an analogy not a mathematical formula with empirical results.
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:16:23
But you can wipe your ass or roll a joint with fiat money!  /s

No problem.  It is very very important that you know the character sets and length of password, knowing the length is the single biggest piece you need.  Without it, it could take centuries to crack.
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:22:16
In order to crack the password, the cracker needs the BIP38 Private Key and there is nothing keeping them from keeping the money once they find the password.  For this reason, only use someone trustworthy.
  
BIP38 is very hard to crack.  If you have 95% of it and you know how long the password was and what character sets where used, it is totally doable but will take time.
  
Good luck!
