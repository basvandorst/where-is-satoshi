Yeah there's also btcs, it's trading even cheaper but I currently hold no positions in it and havnt done much research about it. Personnaly tho I prefer bitcf from looking at the rate of return so far. how I understand bitcf is this.. it's an OTC stock which means it's not traded on the Nasdaq. (For those who don't know) OTC stocks don't have nearly as much regulation to them and by nature have more risk. BITCF is basically a corporation that invests in small business and things that relate to bit coin. So naturally as the value of bit coin goes up, all the companies that are working with it or have a stake in it will also go up thus causing bitcf to go up.

I made a post about there growth and how good I thought it was and someone said "this guy is just trying pump a penny stock that's being manipulated." I don't know whose the idiot me or them lol. Any thoughts? R u holding for a long time or swinging it

PayPal is garbage, that’s why they have an overall 1 star review! Watch out, they can legally shit down your account, steal all your money, And not even tell you why. They did this to a channel on YouTube called Merciful Servant and plenty of others
