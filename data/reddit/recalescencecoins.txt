oh dang, I was summoned.

heh, sure no problem. happy cake day btw ;)
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:42:38
Changes need to be made in a few places. Like how well it turned out for a first iteration.
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:02:23
I totally watched Never Ending Story today.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:43:54
This is a physical bitcoin that will be offered from RecalescenceCoins.com
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:01:17
As to when they will be available, it kinda depends on how many times I have to go back to the mint to get the coin exactly how I want it.
Best I could tell you would be "soon" :)
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:14:58
Welp, this motivated me into updating the site. Thanks everyone for your interest. That coin was a labor of love.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:57:50
Yes, no funds will be loaded by me, it will be up to users to load their own funds.
the holograms themselves will be non-denominated. I'm mulling over having 10 mBTC printed on the outside edge of the coin. This sample comes with that, but I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or not.
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:22:35
Hmmm... that thumbnail looks familiar...
Edit: Looks like they're saying my certificates hold the private key. They do not.
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:54:41
Ha!  
Ill take ownership of that...
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:56:42
Its all business as usual, so thats good
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:26:53
I'm about to turn in for the night. If the coins are still there I'll post a clue.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:19:29
you can use  in the wallet details tab,
or you can use blockchain.info's import private key function, it will detect it as encrypted and ask for a password

We sell physical bitcoins, and very soon many other products bitcoin related.
So far as my coins go, we have a formula that takes the current spot of silver and bitcoin and automatically sets the price with our margine. Doing business this way, we do not automatically convert the BTC to USD so we are fully exposed to the Bitcoin market volatility.
It has its ups and downs. As a business we are trying to pay for the services required to bring new products and features to our customers using Bitcoin, and the only way to do that is to hold BTC. 
When we do convert to fiat, we go through

I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.
He would be a hero in my eyes if the case were different.
What he did took a lot of dedication and effort and really pointed out where I need to be more clear.
bottom line, mistakes and misunderstandings happen. I dont hold it against anyone for being human.
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:57:53
The thing is though, bitcoin is just as amazing now as it was when you were critical of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:43:09
Its a good first step, so long as its not the only step. Being proactive in any capacity is better than abject apathy.

He got it at  ;)
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:44:44
Hopefully in 2014
But those coins hinge on this one being successful.
This coin represents a monumental learning curve. The next coin I produce is going to be much better. I already know what its going to look like, and I get choked up just thinking about it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:55:45
As of today, they're all sold as blanks, so they're as cheap as they can be to the point where I can make a profit and continue making new coins :)

These are DIY coins. There is nothing stopping you from putting a QR on your coin :)
I personally like it typed out for cold storage, which is what this is essentially. Keeps me from spending...

Yes, I was talking with a few dev's in IRC, apparently there was a SNAFU with the mailing list and BIP38 didn't get properly incorporated into the process. 
Apparently they may be supporting BIP32, which is a means to the same ends, just with official developer support and review.

I take everyones tickets, (their handle names x the number of tickets they bought) print them out, cut them to size, wad them up, dump them into a bucket / hat / shoe, and dig my hands around and pull out the winner.
This drawing will be live, and the bitcointalk post will be updated with the link.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:24:48
Nope. They ship blank at the moment. I'm putting together a guide this weekend which these pictures were a product of, that will make it pretty simple to build your own, in your own creative style.
Next year I will have numismatic coins, in which they do contain a non-denominated hologram signed by their purchasing address for verification. 
Of course we can hope FinCEN stops being idiots and Casascius and I can sell loaded coins again...
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:10:53
Yes, and after the first attempt taking 3 days, moving money to gox at the time took me 11hrs on average. 
Most of my frustration stemmed with bankers being incompetent / the system being inefficient in that one person in the entire branch could send wires. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:36:30
Are you familiar with private keys? Basically, you pay me for the coin + the amount that is loaded into it. I place the private key that can redeem the coin underneath a holographic sticker. ta-da! physical bitcoin.
Now there is a slew of issues involved with doing something like this, noteably the fact that you need to trust the person you're buying the physical bitcoin from is actually loading the coin to the address, and also, that the private key FOR that address is under the hologram.
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:23:27
Thanks, It really is a labor of love. 
Edit: Cheers Everyone, I'm off to bed. Thank you all for your kind words.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:14:57
Oh I remembered! Public Key is 1FW3WCQW8kYPndr5ZnRpssMwEoYHzghE1D
I'm going to load a bitcoin to it and see what happens.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:59:56
Yes you did, lucky you!
I had anticipated this might happen, which is why I did not design the coins with the words "bitcoin" or denominate them on the physical coin itself. 
Now I have to go design new certificates... *grumbles*
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:33:15
 in the wallet details tab
import the encrypted private key in the blockchain.info web wallet. Probably the easiest way right there.
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:29:36
If anyone has suggestions so far as technique or other solvents to use, send me a message. 
Check out the first video where I try to rub the key off here: 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:59:10
Pure gold rounds will be available Q1 next year, with pre-orders available Wednesday Dec. 3rd at 12:01 am PST.
The gold plate just **really** makes the detail pop on the coin.
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:24:25
Oh man. I'll answer these questions as best as I can:
Firstly, the concept of physical bitcoins is not new.  -&gt; This gentleman has been doing it since I think at least 2011.
You can think of the private key as the password to your bank account, and works like you would imagine if you knew the password to someones bank account ;)
 Find more information:  
You can use the QR codes to verify through my GPG signature that Recalescence Coins vouches that those public keys belong to their respective coins. No hologram removal necessary.
Learn more about GnuPG here: 
In fact, the Bitcoin wiki can answer these questions way better than I can:
The certificates are about 5x8 inches. The certificate DOES NOT go to your private key. The private key is held underneath the tamper evident hologram. If someone got hold of your certificate, they would be able to see how many bitcoins you hold at that address. Your funds would not be at risk.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:27:12
Well, they are *now*. The coin you will receive will be denominated 1,000 mBTC on its hologram.
This was a direction I was planning on taking anyway, as I had always meant these coins to be a conversation piece when discussing Bitcoin. The incredible price hike recently has made them much less attractive to those ends.
@_date: 2013-08-20 01:41:59
I think we've come to an understanding now. I'm going to be posting on the the site what coins are "dead", that should not be expected in the wild to avoid any further confusion.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:11:30
did you import the key, or sweep it?
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:17:38
If by tomorrow the coins are still there ill post a clue.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:34:54
I guess, but I couldn't give you much more information than a google search would ;)
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:06:48
This is all correct. However, starting today, there *are no keys*. These are all blank coins which you can slap your own BTC into, without any involvement on my part.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:23:10
you can use  go to the wallet details tab and paste the encrypted private key. It will then ask for a password.
You will know you were successful if it displays the QR code for the public and private key.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:15:54
And thats the thing. It was brought up in the senate hearing in regards to the "Boom, Bust" cycle. They want to protect consumers so badly, that they do not realize that this process is necessary as Bitcoin grows.
With each boom and bust, weak hands are shaken out of the market, but the market also retains new believers who understand the long term and world changing benefits Bitcoin has to offer. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:31:43
Thank you, but in the end *you* will be putting this together, not me ;)
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:17:12

@_date: 2013-08-24 06:40:12


This is the RUB right here, and why trust is so important. There is nothing but my word saying that I do not have the private key to your coin since I packaged it. You have to trust that I don't have that key, and have had properly handled it while it was in my posession. 
As well, I can't know for certain if you claimed the coins yourself and are just reporting theft. In this case, I could do nothing for you regardless of how much I want to believe you. Bottom line, treat these coins like cash, don't become a victim.
If your public key has a positive bitcoin balance, the private key will absolutely work. You will know when someone has moved your coins.
You get one certificate for each coin you order, as well as the fine coin easels shown in the picture.
You could take one of these coins, and load them with as many Bitcoins as you personally hold. There's nothing stopping anyone from loading these coins above and beyond 1BTC if they so have the inclination. All one would have to do is send the funds to the public key of your certificate and they will be essentially loading your coin.

After failing to get my web developer to accept bitcoin, I was forced to use the bank today to pay him for a recent bout of development. Spent an hour at the bank trying to do a wire, because only the manager could process those apparently, and she was with another customer.
Two days later the man still had not been paid. Finally I call them and cancel the wire and drive down to the bank, physically withdraw the cash, drive to the Bank of America (whom the developer banks with) wait another hour and finally get the cash deposited to his account.
What a hassle. Would have taken seconds with bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-08-24 05:57:11
About 50$.
 Its not just the cost of an ounce of silver. Its engraving the die, stamping the coins, packaging the coins, shipping the coins, insuring the coins, and the type of finish I have on the coins that jack the price way over what an ounce actually trades at.
Then there is all the work that goes into placing the hologram, shipping, website maintenance and development... etc etc... god I'm glad its the weekend.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:20:18
yeah, you should have moved the money ASAP. Didn't think to mention that for the sake of the newbes... but hell, here's some reddit gold as a consolation prize for playing.

As per the title of this post, these coins are DIY. So I guess what is stopping them is the fact I am *only* selling bullion.

Casascius coins are great though. If you cant trust me, I would highly recommend his coins, 2-factor or not. He's been in business for years now and is very trusted with the community. 
I bought his coins for friends and family as well. They really do make great gifts.

My holograms had the Bitcoin "B" on their center. My plan for these coins is to communicate ideals rather than focus on the pure "money" of it.
So the coins are rife with symbolism all inspired by the bitcoin protocol. The coin's being loaded with BTC was just a happy bonus.

Yeah its a bummer in a way, but these coins were conceived with this eventuality in mind. When I designed the coin, I wanted to make sure that at the very least people could still buy them and make their own.
Bitcoin is still Bitcoin, and my coins still carry a message that can be conveyed regardless if *I* load them with BTC or not.

@_date: 2013-08-24 07:31:50
One thing I had in mind with these coins is reusablity. The coins have built in receses that make it really easy to make your own physical bitcoin.
Thats why there is no denomination on the silver itself.
The Holographic stickers, and the costs involved with making them are non trivial... having special holograms available in those specific amounts is just not possible for me ;)
The text that makes up the private key is actually very, **very** resiliant to rubbing (but not scraping, and **NOT** solvents) As I have vigerously tired to rub off the private key while wearing those gloves with no success.
The receses the private key sits in is polished smooth, dry, and clean. The hologram laying over it creates a static, nearly air free environment. I assure you the text is quite clear in person.
If you are planning on storing for prolonged periods of time, I recommend using a paperwallet, such as you can find at 
Paper in the right conditions has lasted *thousands* of years. Print out a paper wallet or two, hide them some place innocuous, or store them in a safe or safe deposit box.
The plastic my private keys are printed to is transparency paper, like you would see on an overhead projector. I've seen some really old trancparencies (~10 years) that have held up decently, none of which were in such static conditions as the private key.
Beyond that, I really don't know. I Expect people will redeem their coins long before then. There is still the numismatic of the coin, as you will have the certificate with its corrisponding serial, and the peeled serial from the coin still retains its own.
Make your own coin out of it. Put Batman on there. ;)
...but not Ben Affleck
And now I must sleep. Cheers!
