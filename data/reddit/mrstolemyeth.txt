They can try, but deep down they know they have no control over it whatsoever.

Welcome, boy you are in for quite a ride
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:30
Well you have... wait nope it just went down. Luckily we still got.. er nope never mind. Oh boi...
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:46
Great! Just remember this isn't magic internet money - don't put in more than you can afford to lose. Nobody knows for sure where the price will go. But still, I wish you good luck!

I meant can't afford to lose it.

Since you're new, some quick tips:
* Don't try to time the market. You will lose money. Better to buy and hold onto it until you feel like selling.
* Don't take any investment advice without doing your own research. Nobody knows anything for sure.
* Hold for as long as you wish. Nobody can predict the price, so it's up to you when to sell.
* You can try to dollar-cost average. Look it up online, it's buying small bits every week/month/...
* Keep your head cool. If you see the price plummet, don't sell. Have trust, the price will go up again!
* Most important of all: good luck!

Sorry for your loss dude and thanks for sharing!
Hope you'll still be getting that weekend vacation despite this situation.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:42:42
Wow that sucks man. Never ever invest more than you are prepared to lose. I know this may not be the time to say this, but for real: people keep on making hasty decisions and then we get situations like this.
Hope Kraken gets back to you soon, I wish you good luck!
(Also Kraken has been very busy lately - just like all the other exchanges)

Bitcoin is not rational.
Neither are any of our decisions.
Neither is Alan frigging Greenspan.

Boyos, you should probably click that link before commenting
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:47:00
Yes, but the Ledger doesn't hold the Bitcoin itself. It just holds your private key for you that is used to access the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:26:24
Or you could just not day trade and keep investing small amount into bitcoin and/or other coins. That's probably a better idea, you might lose it all when you try daytrading. You can't and won't beat the market.

This is how we spot the mass adoption. Oh boi...

@_date: 2017-12-09 11:24:04
Yeah, a Ledger Nano S is great. I use one myself, its not super convenient but at least you know your funds are safe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:30:36
Hi there!
If I were you, I'd suggest you do some more reading before putting in such an amount of money. I know this recent price increase may have you worried you'll miss out, but you won't regret educating yourself a bit more before taking the step to investing.
You could maybe also try to invest your thousand dollars in 4 times (each for 250) to avoid missing out on any possible dips that could come.
And like you said: yes, currently there's a whole lot of transactions waiting to be confirmed. Bitcoin has been gaining a lot of popularity.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:39
that is the million dollar question
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:19:24
In a way yes, but instead of having to enter your pin yourself the Ledger saves it for you. Just plug it in and you're ready to go. The computer never gets the chance to see your private key.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:45:06
Just put in another million, you simply didn't put in enough funds. 2 million wil at least make you a bazillionaire by tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:49:06
Not at all; hardware wallets are way safer. Look up Ledger Nano S and Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:48:06
This is a great lesson. Don't try to beat the market. The market will beat you 99,9% of the time. Don't let this discourage you though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:26:00
Man, the same thing happened to me. Luckily I just got an email - some foreign prince wants to send me a million dollars. Here comes the best part: all of this for a small one-time transaction fee of a thousand bucks. What a guy!
Maybe he can help us both out?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:12
you'll be fine in the long run
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:28:04
Wow just discovered the current BTC price, amazing!
I'll send you a bunch right away to celebrate my gains. Lucky I saved my Mt Gox login details all these years, hah! Imagine if I threw those away. Brb logging in..
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:54:13
OP sold low and bought high. Pretty much the same thing. It is a lesson that'll teach OP to hold.

Nice try, IRS

So you want to offer services such as helping people's kids - remotely? How does that work?
Wouldn't it be a better idea to offer these services locally and (dare I say it on the btc sub) in USD? Will probably be less of a hassle for you guys.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:15:32
what's a bit coin? another one of those words these damn kids are using on the line?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:32
I would suggest: learn how to invest for yourself even though you you don't feel competent enough (yet). Don't do it, very bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:03:44
So you're saying sending 200.000 dollars to an exchange all at once isn't a risk you shouldn't take if you can't afford it?
Fully knowing the BTC network is currently clogged by transactions and seeing dozens of people complaining about issues they're experiencing all over the web including losing coins, stuck transactions, ...
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:38:13
Thanks for sharing man, hopefully you'll stick around. Great that you're learning to keep your head calm - you indeed can't beat the market.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:04:34
100 dollars seems very high, not sure where you saw this price.
It's up to you if you want to invest in one or not. If you really believe bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general will continue to grow, it's a small price to pay to secure yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:49:59
Hardware wallets are great! If you feel like that 700$ is worth a lot to you (and you think it'll keep growing), make sure to look into a Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:47:49
Wanna beat the market? It's really simple: just hold. Stay calm.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:56:37
No way I'm paying 120,000 for a car. I don't even have 135,000 to spend. Whoever is going to pay that 114,000 is crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:03:22
Oh boi I wanna get rich fast. Where do I sign up?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:04:25
Mt. Gox is all you need
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:08:15
Beat me to it, haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:51:13
oh my god LMAO

Today. Tomorrow. Yesterday. 
Your bet is as good as any. Do some research and see how you feel about it! Advice from others may be helpful, but never fully depend on others without checking for yourself :')
