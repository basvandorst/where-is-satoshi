Isn't the point of sunk cost fallacy that you should not factor in a sunken cost when deciding future use of the money? In this example if I sunk in a million usd to mining bitcoin, and produce 3 million worth of btc, I should not consider the 1 million I already spent when deciding whether to stick with it or not.  It is a psychological attachment only, and doesn't actually influence which decision will provide ideal returns.

A good hard forking would increase your block size though.  To be fair.

Dude I am not cool with the rounded edge on the bowls of the inner B.  Make them squares and harmonize the width of the central stem.  It should be slightly thinner than the primary left stem to compensate for the fact that it's in the middle.  Try 61.8%, center on the middle of the central two ascenders on the B.  Seriously this is so close to being dope but these little details are giving me a migraine.

Chart shows BTC price around 144 krona.  That's about 18 USD.  so either this chart is very old or there's something I'm missing.

Opportunity cost.  
If you have 10 dollars, and you invest it with 100% gain, you get 20 dollars.
If you leave it in the bank and get 1% gain, you have $10.10.  So the cost of not investing it is $9.90.

It is clearer, yes, thank you.
So the upcoming event on August 1...
I understand that it is a dispute between two camps over something called Segwit.  And the block size.  And what I am gathering is that one path is better for miners like Jihan, because that path will allow his methods to continue to be very profitable. The other path is preferable to the average user because it...?  Makes bitcoins faster?
I am having trouble figuring out the basics of the dispute because all the articles assume you know a lot about bitcoins and blockchains.  But I am a beginner so I am struggling.  Could you explain about August 1 and what it is about and why the two sides want different things?  Like what are their motives?

What the hell is this all about?  All I see on reddit is this weird war, which only gets more confusing the more I read about it.  There are these weird personalities I have never heard of that people either love, or hate.  There are other coins people won't even mention, there are accusations of censorship.
Can someone please sum up in a reasonable way what the hell is going on? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:09:27
Please explain to me.  Who is Jihan?  How does one man have so much power?
