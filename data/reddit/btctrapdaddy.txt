Can you elaborate on what exactly happened when it was corrupted?  I dont see how my paper wallet could ever be corrupted
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:14:53
Ok thanks for clarifying.  So you had the keys on a USB as well as other places for back up?  Would I have this issue if I'm only using paper wallets for cold storage?? Also what is the advantage of using storage like that if it can be corrupted??

Thanks for the reply.  Are there any precautions I should be aware of with regards to moving the zip file on the usb stick?? Also, what advantage does the Linux have as opposed to just using an outdated version of windows or something?? The computer I'm planning on using is old and isn't on the internet anyway, so wouldn't a fresh OS mean it's safe regardless??

Look how triggered you are dude.  All you guys can do is try to protect your narrative but it's not going to work. It's fraud and fraud always fails. That's why Greg and Sipa had to chime in.  You guys don't get to define Bitcoin. The white paper does.

I'm interested in Bitcoin. Bitcoin was fine without Segwit and has never had a feature of that scale added to it. So in my view by adding Segwit you made a different cryptocurrency, Segwitcoin.  Segwitcoin is an altcoin.  Core doesn't get to decide what Bitcoin is.  It has been clearly defined in the white paper.  Core's job is to adhere to the white paper, not radically change the protocol.  Why don't you take your altcoin somewhere else and let the real Bitcoiners have their original Bitcoin back.

Classic R/Bitcoin move to ban my account, so I can't even respond on that account.
You can't come up with a logical argument so you silence me.  I'm advocating for Bitcoin to stay the same and scale as it has traditionally done so, which is proven to work.
It is the small blockers who have taken Bitcoin astray from the goal of being a world currency. 
Moore's law has not been debunked.
You say Jameson was making satire out of that Bitcoin.com article (he wasn't) but don't even make a rebuttal besides calling it FUD or saying it made people puke (insane). 
So ban this one too mods and keep proving big blockers right.
I'm not a troll. I'm a long time Bitcoin USER who is not happy with the direction Bitcoin has taken. I don't care about the price. I'm not in Bitcoin to be rich. I'm here to be free.

I disagree that Bitcoin solutions of 2009 are hodge-Porte and different from today. I think we should stay the course that got us here. If you want to try 2017 solutions, make an alt coin and try them. Let Bitcoin scale as it traditionally has.  I don't want to see nay sayers like Adam influencing Bitcoin.

No my other account got banned for trolling (even though I'm just having a debate) this is my old account.

yea I'm in the U.S. But why goldman?

“When bitcoin first came out, I was on the cryptography mailing list. When it happened, I sort of laughed. Because I had already proven that decentralized consensus was impossible.”

Just curious what his credentials are. He said he proved decentralized consensus to be impossible, which sounds like a PhD thesis or something, but I couldn't find anything on google scholar. So idk.
