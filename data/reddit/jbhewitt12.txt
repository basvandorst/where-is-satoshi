Nope, if troll posts that serve no use in evoking useful discussion are posted on r/bitcoin then of course they should be removed. But the censorship campaign goes far beyond that.  


Haha that's easy to say, but you obviously didnt actually look at the evidence. The 'rebuttal' you're talking about, which can be found [here]( has a wave of replies calling bullshit on it. Many people are asking for the mod logs to be released so that it can be easily seen as to what really happened, but that isn't going to happen because then the truth would be out.

Lol, that list contains a bunch of troll posts. On any subreddit troll posts will be deleted. 
Also if someone were to attempt to list all of the censorship in the r/bitcoin subreddit it would be in the thousands. A guy who runs the Censorship Notifier Bot that works over the whole of reddit and who isn't involved in crypto felt the need to write [this post]( showing a **mountain of evidence** that the mods of r/bitcoin launched a false flag attack on themselves and blamed it on r/btc.
Literally all you have to do to see what is happening here is look at the evidence. It speaks for itself.

u/apocynthion said "Please make the mod log public then. If you really do not have anything to hide, this should be a non-issue right?"
It does seem that this would be the simplest fix, as it would become obvious what happened without all the speculation from both sides.

haha fair. At least one side doesn't involve a ton of censorship. I'm pretty surprised my original comment is still there tbh

You guys really need to check out r/btc. How do you know you're on the right side if you haven't evaluated both? :)
