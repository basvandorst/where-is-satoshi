Why?? 
Why do we have to watch Bitcoin address even if it is owned by a hacker. For what purpose? Are you going to follow those coins until it is laundered? 
And why do we have to worry about stupid peoples money? If some people allow others to generate private keys for them for whatever reason then they are in the wrong business.

Bitcoin will be very sucessfull as a currency by any currency definition.

I think decentralized knowledge-base backed by decentralized currency is good idea. It can be an autonomous agent. It pays people who provide it with computation power &amp; storage. It pays contributors with good rating. It charges members small amounts of bitcoins to use the knowledge-base.

I agree, but you will need more than "better" features to successfully start a currency. You also need userbase. BTC is becoming partially successful as more and more users start using it. When there are enough users and markets start using bitcoin, more users will be attracted. And currencies grow like that. So any new currency have to be radically better than bitcon like bitcoin is to fiats to replace bitcoin.
And the features bitcoin currently provide are not limited. We have seen many features being added, existing features improved and we will see more improvements in the future. Today bitcoin is more resilient than it was one year ago. So again any new international currency has to improve and mature much faster than bitcoin to gain any ground.

I tried to convince a major adult entertainment industry that provides live camera models but failed. They have no reason to change since the existing method is to their advantage.
** HERE IS A BUSINESS MODEL **
A website that anyone can buy a spot in bitcoins (no need for registration) and start streaming live cam. Models could choose to charge for viewing /per session /per time or just free stream and collect tips. Users search, browse for live cam channels and gets entertained.
*Web site owner*
* Registers a domain
* Pays for hosting and development
* Pays for marketing
* Sells channel to the models
* Buys a computer and camera
* Buys a channel from the website using bitcoin /per hour  /per resource usage (configurable)
* Sets up her page, configures charging models and handles her/his own marketing
* Streams content and can charge /per hour or collects tips etc
* Browses site, searches and finds interesting channel
* Pays the model according to the models configuration

I believe bitcoin should not be one solution to all our money problems. It has its strength as value storage and transfer. Other systems can be build on top of bitcoin to solve other problems. 
But that said it is possible to add features to the protocol. In fact the next release v0.6 is going to contain so much nice things. And bitcoin is unlikely to became obsolete anytime soon. For it to became obsolete, all the people invested in it have to basically give up there investments.

People are already using debit cards and self serve POS for their day to day shopping. In [Kenya]( 14 million people use, hard to use SMS based, mobile payment system. It is a tiny step from current bitcoin status to better system.

If the world was one country, that would have worked. But unfortunately there are other countries with different views.

Some of my reasons:
1. Because poor people, for example in Africa, can now have open world market. Which means, bitcoin is a very important bypass from traditional barriers both infrastructural and social.
2. Because inflation tax which funds a lot of conflicts in the world is affected by bitcoin. With Bitcoin as global currency, many states will not be able to afford war.

Bitcoin are very important for more reasons.
For starters, not everybody has credit card. There are parts of the world where getting credit card is very difficult or just impossible. With Bitcoin people can, all of a sudden send/receive buy/sell things online without any barriers.
But most of all, we all seem to forget it is just 2011. Worldwide things don't just happen overnight. There are projects from distributed exchange to online stores being actively developed. This things need time. There is more and more people that are being educated about bitcoin each day. At my workplace, nearly all the developers and project managers don't know about bitcoin at all. People need more time identify, resist, learn, embrace bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-11-28 08:56:35
Well what it means is: You don't have to provide your personal details to have bitcoins. You don't have to register, prove your identity and have your details available to anyone to own and spend bitcoins.
But there are ways to prove that address A and B are owned by same person. But that is pretty much useless for any meaningful information. There are other possibilities to identify IP addresses of bitcoin address owner by connecting to all nodes in the network. But also there are ways to hide your real IP address (e.g. Tor)

But then what are you going to do about it? 
In a free market, people have degree of freedom to take an action in response to information they believe to be true. In fact people can save or make a lot of money if they have good information. So if you think you are right about your information then act on it. 
But trying to change a fact by convincing all the players is impossible in a free market. If you shout about a bubble hoping people will stop buying and the bubble disappears is just useless. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:09:26
There are some facts you need to understand:
1 - Supply of bitcoins (new bitcoins created) will stay the same for the coming 4 years. 
2 - ASICs are efficient on mining but will not increase the supply of bitcoins
3 - Price of bitcoin depends on supply, demand
As you see from the above facts, there is no direct way for ASICs contribute for price of bitcoin. ASICs contribute to the security and integrity of the network. One major part of bitcoin pricing is speculation and a security of the network affects confidence which will affect price.

They are not stupid. They know how bitcoins work, they know any meaningful action against bitcoin has to be international in nature. The US will not want to be left alone while the Europeans, Chinese and Africans are trading in bitcoins. At the very least they will try to pass laws together with the Europeans and Japan.

Just because you saw it sitting at the table does not mean it cannot be embedded in a wall.

The CEO of OpenCoin disagrees with you. They intend to fund themselves with XRP. It has value and it is transferable. It is a currency as described by its CEO

When bitcoin becomes huge, it will be a major industry in the whole world. 
It is highly competitive and anyone not keeping up with technology is loosing the game.

of course, you can also add non-human words in there to make it even more impossible. But you need to keep a printed copy somewhere safe. Human memory is not reliable.

What stops a super rich guy from buying all the gold?

Just don't forget there is a relation between bitcoin price (rise and fall) and the adoption rate. Recent bitcoin price rise has attracted a lot of people: users, business owners, investors and more importantly IT experts who will start implementing killer apps. So speculation did something good for bitcoin economy.

What about the other factors that increase value of a currency in relation to other currency. In the case of bitcoin, it could be a weak dollar, it could be anticipation of dollar devaluation. 
It can also be anticipation that goods and services offered in bitcoin will increase in number in the immediate future. If so, is it really considered a bubble? 
What about gold? What is the gold economy? Since almost no one offers goods and services for gold, can we consider gold economy to be so small? And gold is in a huge bubble?

The crash of 2011 was cause by the hack of Mtgox. Then recovered to ~15 after they closed for weeks. But the damage was done and we saw a slow decline.

Happy Reddit birthday

No, the amount of coins generated will not change. Mining difficulty will increase and the network will adjust block generation accordingly to limit the reward at only 25 coins every ten minutes.

You should hear the CEO of OpenCoin speak with RT couple of days ago. He was clear about using these "tokens" to fund the company and developers. These tokens have value and that is OpenCoin's intension. The tokens are being sold for real bitcoins.
update: the interview 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:45:11
To do real damage (besides temporary price reduction) to bitcoin, multiple world governments have to cooperate to pass a law banning activities related to bitcoin and enforce in coordinated manner. For example, US, Japan, Europe, China, Russia, etc.  This is nearly impossible. They couldn't even stop botnets.
The US government can act alone and pass laws banning or limiting use of bitcoins. This will definetly slow down rate of adaption and shift activities of bitcoin to outside US. And soon or later the ban will be lifted as the US will not want to be left out in the next big technological revolution.

Pure speculation here. 
I think there are some wealthy Kim DotCom's followers that accepted his advice yesterday. Maybe someone from the middle east or far east Asia that do not have to think twice before spending few thousand or million dollars.

Page loads user looks at the price and starts filling forms as the price changes dynamically up and down. User sees this live. Note: value of the item has not changed in terms of USD or EUR.

You know there is technical solution to this problem. They can show live price converted to btc as page loads. They can immediately convert bitcoins to fiat and hold much stable currency just after purchase.
