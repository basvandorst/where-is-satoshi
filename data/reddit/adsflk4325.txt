The first word--the very first word--in Satoshi's whitepaper is "commerce". Commerce is about transactions. Not about a store of value, or transferring wealth. It can certainly be your opinion that that's what Bitcoin's ultimate purpose should be, but I just want to point out, for those relatively new to Bitcoin, that this is not the original vision.

"It went up so it's a good store of value" is really not a great argument.

It's not merely a technical discussion. To have a purely technical discussion, you have to agree on the objectives, and we don't. Your starting point is the non-technical statement "Bitcoin's best use case is as a global store of value". From this all else follows. Note that I am not currently arguing against any of your subsequent reasoning. If you begin with a different thought, something like "Bitcoin's best use case is to allow any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party; its value derives entirely from this property", then you might end up in a different place with regard to on-chain scaling. 
We can't have a purely objective discussion about conclusions because we have different premises. I'm not here to convince you of my premises, I'm just here to point out that some people have different ones.
