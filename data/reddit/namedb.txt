"Leftist" is one of those words that other-ize. I'm progressive, as I'd like to see society progress towards a better system than we've ever had.  That's opposed to conservatives, which I understand to want to conserve the best parts of our society and stop it's erosion. I get it, it's not evil, I just feel like where we've been is worse than where we can be. I feel like crypto is helpful in getting us there. 
I mean, Bitcoin is a consensus based public record. That has to be better for EVERYONE than a central authority with hidden records, right? That's real progress for our society, right? Forget the bleeding heart free everything caricature of "leftists." I just want to see baby steps toward a better future, and an HONEST system of money is a good step.

Two brothers used leverage and futures contracts to corner the market for delivery.  They were entitled to receive delivery of up to 70% of the global supply.  As the people on the other sides of those trades started to try to buy the actual metal they were obligated to deliver,  the price skyrocketted. At its peak,  Congress passed a law changing the way leverage was allowed,  they got margin called,  and those contracts had to be sold at market. 
I'm not saying you're wrong,  the same situation might be about to happen.  But not because the graphs are similar, and there are other possibilities that would cause similar runups without the same crash.

This is the only legitimate concern.  It's a way out for the short-term speculators.  I feel like long term (1yr+) speculators/investors will still hold a fair amount of their positions for fear of rising costs of futures contracts,  and ideological holders will hodl, obviously.  
Pricewise, will the cme/cboe bring enough new money into the fold that it outweighs the loss of speculative short term money? Who knows,  but I think it will be a net positive. The day after first contact settlement will surely bring interesting moves.

@_date: 2018-09-25 23:16:28
At it's max, there would be nothing to compare it to. btc:usd would be meaningless, because if usd has any value at all, then btc hasn't reached it's max possible value. All other cryptos would also be worthless, and it's all kind of a difficult thought experiment. 
The max theoretical value I'm willing to entertain, which is still fairly silly, would be completely replacing gold's place as an investment. At worst, gold's use is 50% coinage/investment grade bars, and the other half is split between jewelry, industry, and electronics. So if BTC were to have half the market cap of gold, each Bitcoin would be worth ~15 million usd.

I held roughly 50-50 btc-alts in my portfolio in January. still do, and I maintained it by putting more fiat into alts than btc, so I've felt both sides of what you described. It's 100% accurate. My btc side is like, "Well, I timed that poorly, but that's okay I can afford more now!" 
My altcoin side has felt (feels?) like a fucking dumbass for wasting all this money and ashamed to even mention crypto in front of my friends. I've come so close to selling some of my alts for btc, but for some stupid ass reason I'm just going to hold them. Not that it makes much difference at this point. I bought NEO for almost $200?

Look, the reason btcusd fluctuates 10-15% % in a week is guys like you. The reason it fluctuates 1000% in a year is guys like me. You should understand guys like me before you make a decision as to how you will or won't participate in this technology.
 I understand how gold is typically traded: Mostly retail joe's thinking they're diversifying or yoloing on leveraged etfs because they can't get margin accts and think the world's gonna end. Any comparison between holding btc in a secure, private wallet and your broker holding an etf that gives you cash redemption claims to part of a gold future contract is so mind mindbogglingly obtuse that I didn't even consider you making that analogy.
I'll address why I'm not addressing your 'blockchain' points in my next paragraph. Read it carefully, and please try to understand, I'm not the hand holding type, but you seem like you could do some good in this space, and I hate to see your enthusiasm go to waste over something so simple. So:
What is colloquially known as a 51% attack does not require the attacker to hold or control any bitcoin. I really want to draw your attention to your misunderstanding of this point, because it belies your ignorance of what bitcoin is. I haven't taken a single word you've said seriously since I saw that mistake in your thinking, and you explaining it further without doing a bit more research is borderline troll-y. A 51% attack is when an actor has so much computing power under his control (that he can re-write the blockchain. This attacker must solve a math problem faster than every other miner in the world. Then he has to do it again. And again. And again. And again. He's competing against many warehouses full of devices specifically designed to solve this type of math problem. If he's successful, he can re-write the blockchain to say that all btc have been sent to him. This immediately makes the front page of every newspaper and website in the world, and BTC is worthless. He's left with nothing but infamy. Game over.
Not understanding what this type of attack is, and not understanding what stops it from being feasible, means you do not understand bitcoin or blockchain. Again, please, please do some more research into this technology. 
I get how bond ladders work, I understand carried interest, I can read a 10K, I can design simple options strategies (though I don't know their names). I understand that world as well as I need to. THIS IS NOT THAT. Open your mind, look at the tech for a few weeks. I know a lot of the info seems dense and overly technical, but I promise: you can get it. It's no more complex than say, an internal combustion engine, or a well-balanced portfolio, or TARP. Good luck, and let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:42:56
I think your understanding of Bitcoin is lacking in a few key places, and I think you know this. For example, you say blockchain will revolutionize the world. "100%." But not cryptos? The more useful a particular blockchain is, the more valuable it is, and thus becomes a larger target of attack. The blockchain's coin/token/crypto is its way of defending itself; rewarding honest actions and making attacks more expensive. The value IS the security, and without the value, there is no security. 
Secondly, as shady as the USD is, it's one of the more trustworthy currencies on earth. It's backed by a massive security force and huge economy, and integrated into all of the world's financial systems in a fundamental way. However, most people on earth who know about, or will know about bitcoin, will be comparing it against their local currency. You hate XBTUSD, but how would you feel about BTC vs your local currency in Japan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, India, Congo, Russia, England, Greece or Germany (very different views on the Euro)? These people will have much better reasons to move some of their wealth onto the most secure blockchain they can find.

Wow, thank you for telling me that story, I think it helped clarify your perspective very well. I read back through your responses, and, to me, it seems like you see things almost as if you ARE an institution with billions at your disposal.  So much so that, if what you say is true, I would guess you are here in a professional context. 
That may be the source of our disagreement. I've got fairly well-defined monetary goals for myself... I know how much I would need to live out my life without needing more 'value,' and if you add a Lamborghini to that amount, it would still fit into the Miscellaneous Expenses budget of most investment firms. I look at the btc market cap as I look at an ocean; if you see it as a nice water feature in front of someone else's neighborhood, we're going to build our boats differently. I.e. you won't be building a boat.
For an institution, a gold ETF will be functionally the same as an equally valued brick of gold, but without the cost of storage. For an individual, there are events which would make the brick much more valuable: divorce, incarceration, identity theft, bankruptcy, etc. Being able to grab a thing which will help you survive for 6 months and put it in your pocket is value that doesn't exist for investment firms. The lower down the socio-economic ladder you go, the more valuable that kind of thing is. Your statement that "So as long as you can convert your currency into something, you can hop around from any currency to any asset class pretty quickly" is another example of something that is true to you, but is unimaginable to many. BTC is something that people who have never had the ability to 'convert their currency into another asset' have access to. 
And I concede that (without doing the actual math) if you have the capital for 'your 51% attack,' then you probably have the capital for 'my 51% attack,' so they may be interchangeable from an institution's perspective but very different from a technological perspective. I think we can both be right there, so you seem to understand bitcoin well enough for your professional purposes. 
I wonder, how do your personal investments differ from those you vet/recommend for your firm? Do they differ?
I must admit, in re-reading your replies, I was trying to figure out what it is that you hope to gain by coming here so that I might help. I can't quite put my finger on it, so feel free to give me a hint.
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:22:58
How does one company guarantee that the data on their blockchain is entered honestly, and not tampered with? It has to be public, open source, and auditable. Each data entry must be accompanied by a cost, some sort of financial hardship or investment that will be lost if the entry is found to be falsified. But why would Joe Local Producer participate in this blockchain? Will his goods be worth so much more with 'blockchain verification' that he's willing to make a sufficient investment in participating? And remember, "sufficient investment" means "risking enough capital on his data to prove that he is an honest actor"
Response to edit: That's NOT how 51% attacks work. Please, if you're going to be in this space and write a bunch of professional sounding pseudo-advice, learn more. You're very convincing, but you have picked up a few misconceptions that not only will mislead others, but I feel may cost you a lot of money if you don't correct them.
2) I imagine the 'end game' use of cryptocurrencies a little differently. Rather than a Venezuela or Zimbabwe style panic flight, I see deliberate erosion of purchasing power as countries continue trying to devalue their currencies, with possible severe capital controls that make local currencies undesirable. Japan is a recent example of the first, Greece an example of the second. In these scenarios your store of value is something you need to have bought prior to the event (that's how hedges work), and something that you can use to purchase goods. 
Imagine having 1 BTC, vs having 8 ounces of gold in a safe. The gold in your safe has to be spent locally, in a place where everyone else is trying to ditch their local currency. BTC can be converted on exchange 30 minutes before you spend it on Amazon. One day in the future, maybe a major retailer will take it directly, but even now it's easier to order toilet paper, water, protein bars, and otc medicine with btc than gold. And in Europe, Asia, or Africa, holding stacks of hundred dollar bills isn't much different than holding gold in that neither give you direct access to the internet. BTC, in this way, gives you almost immediate, almost uncensorable, access to the international marketplace, in a form that's deflationary regardless of your local government's currency manipulation. I'm not sure any other asset can do this, and that makes it an incredible hedge against local government action.

Personally, and mind you I never say I'm in it for the tech, but I'm invested in btc because I believe I the tech. To me, that means I will be spending my btc one day in the probably distant future, on goods or services with someone who accepts btc directly within an economy that operates in terms of btc. 
My btc will never be converted to fiat, and I feel (wrongly, it seems lately) that I can convert my fiat to btc at a better rate now than I will be able to when I want to spend it.

Yeah there is a middle ground of seeing the actual btc as an asset. I wouldn't convert btc to fiat, as that's a worse asset in every way. But holding 3 mortgages worth of value in one asset while I still owe a mortgage on the asset I live in might be a problem for me. Paying off that mortgage would completely change the way I live, the work I do, the time I spend with my family. 
Imagine sitting @ $400k. Your options are: a) sell half to immediately pay off mortgage, b) don't, just hodl. Afterwards, btc either a) goes to $1mil (fiat collapse),  b) goes to $0, c) bounces between 300k-500k for the rest of your life. 
A,A) I'm great, maybe a bit bummed sometimes
A,B) I'm great.
A,C) I'm great. 
B,A) I'm great.

I understand how that would work on a conceptual level. But could you explain, or point me to an explanation, how that actually happens? I mean, who writes the clever software that puts the block together in the most profitable way? Is there competition in the block building software space?

Right. Some more conservative math: 5% of revenues is about 850 btc. Let's assume they hold none, and just use the one day forward contract through bakkt, and keep 1 day's revenue in the till  to smooth operations with relatively minimal risk. That takes 1700 btc out of circulation indefinitely, and gives us, at least, a 0.1% bump in price, so $40

Yes. We live in US, were staying in Ireland (currency: EUR) for a couple weeks, and took the ferry to IoM (currency is GBP) in a spur of the moment decision to see the races. If you're not familiar with the IoM TT this may seem odd, but its a small island of a few thousand suddenly is swarmed by tens of thousands of fairly wealthy, partying, motorcycle enthusiasts and racers for two weeks. 
We showed up at the end of week 1, with backpacks, euros and debit cards, left most of our luggage in Ireland, and had reserved a campground on the northern part of the island (shout out to The Silly Moo!), ferrying into the southern tip (only point of entry). The plan was to ferry into town, buy a tent, and take a bus to the campground. 
Buses are cash only. My cards had only been working at ATMs for the whole trip for some reason, and at large businesses (car rental, hotels, etc) but not for small purchases (pubs, merchants, taxis). I realized this days earlier so I'd just been keeping plenty of Euros on me. But EUR don't work on the Isle. No problem, just go to an ATM! No Cash. Go to another ATM - out of service. Ok. Go to another ATM - out of service. Fuck. All banks are closed (Friday after 5pm), 80% of businesses are closed because locals either party with the bikers, or leave for the event. Only places open are pubs, and every pub's ATM is out of service. So we just started walking. The town is on a hill (coast of an island), and the coastal streets are full of drunken tourists so we walked uphill away from the water into the residential area. Finally found a tiny convenience store with an ATM at the very back that was working. Took out all I was comfortable holding and encountered the next challenge: pubs don't sell tents, and the only places open were pubs...

If we grant your premises, I'm still not sure we can conclude that lacking what gives the dollar value makes bitcoin worthless. Maybe the bitcoin ecosystem is worth only a part of the dollar's ecosystem, but also don't forget that bitcoin competes against all currencies, and many assets. If we were two people in China discussing bitcoin verses the yuan, the calculus would be different. Or two brits discussing bitcoin vs the euro. Or two traders in Hong Kong discussing bitcoin vs gold. Two fund managers discussing buying a small efficient bitcoin mining operation vs buying ten thousand shares of Visa. 
It may lose each of those comparisons outright. But if bitcoin possesses some of what gives each of those things value, and possesses some traits that none of things possess, then it has some value. How much? Who knows...

I think those are just people new to the space. They got here by way of traditional trading, and see it through that lens. After some time, they'll come around to what makes bitcoin unique (scarcity, immutability) compared to traditional assets and value it based on those characteristics. Or they'll get bored, leave, and in 2022 as btc starts heading towards $90k they'll be that guy talking about how he bought two btc  and sold both at 7500.
I got here through gaming, overclocking my amd gpus, and finding the monero mining community using the same tools I was. Mining xmr was just a way to test my overclocking ability, and I didn't even look into bitcoin because it had nothing to do with my gpus.  Took me quite a while, 6 months or so, to get a full(ish) understanding of the crypto landscape. Stock traders, Info sec guys, libertarians, drug dealers/buyers, FBI analysts, bankers... all these communities initially see bitcoin as something that seems obvious and familiar on the surface: simply a dollar that has some trait they like or dislike. It fits well into their worldview at first, but it crystallizes after a while, like water freezing inside a boulder. They see the whole, the earth-shattering potential, and that worldview cracks. Then they're one of us.

You're looking at his strategy backwards. You see his results as poor, but he's accumulating bitcoin, and he has to make decisions in real time. His stated goal is to acquire bitcoin, not to acquire more dollars by means of buying and later selling bitcoin.
Try this: what should he do with his next paycheck (say he gets paid tomorrow)? What specific action can he take that will a) guarantee that he does not end up with less bitcoin than he has right now, and b) maximize the amount of bitcoin he has 5 years from now.

Right now, if you accept btc in a transaction, it could hypothetically crash to 0 in a minute. Or, if you pay in btc, it could moon to 1mil in a minute. I say this to illustrate one difficulty in accepting actual bitcoin. A similar difficulty is finding the correct exchange value to use for calculations (bittrex, cboe, bitstamp, etc)
What Bakkt will do is, in a way, say: "Pay us $X today, and we will put 1 btc in your wallet tomorrow morning. Or send us 1 btc, and we will put $X in your account tomorrow morning." 
This moves a business's ability to plan, with exact, guaranteed numbers, from a minute or two into the future, to 1 day. It sounds small, but it's huge. It addresses all of the companies out there that may want to accept/pay with btc, but, rightly, don't want to expose their investors/board members to the crazy risk of a 10% drop in value in a day.
 Edit: You said ELI5. I did not. Apologies.

Do it. Do it. A million times do it. The races are mental, obviously... but the scene... Every single bike on the isle that week (thousands) is its owner's pride and joy. Everything is modified to go faster, nothing is stock, nothing is stretched, no bs wide tires or chrome, or Harleys or any nonsense. You see pictures and it's like, "BIKES!!!"  But we were walking a dirt path between two farms, and I pulled my phone out to take a picture of this cafe'd Aprilia parked at a fenced entrance to one of the farms when an MV Agusta, Ducati dual sport, and two other bikes come puttering along beside us trying to find a way back to pavement. It's a fantasy land. 
I obviously didn't have my bike, but on day two of our stay the guy I the best tent, a local who volunteered to be the safety coordinator of the track corner at the entrance to the campsite, offered to let me borrow his old katana 600 to get around the island for the rest of our stay. I declined, not trusting myself to actually ride in a place like that without doing stupid things.

Felt a legitimate tinge of nausea this morning... still holding. I told myself when I started this that I'd rather be a sucker than a lil bitch, and I knew my job/family wouldn't allow me to trade, so I invested accordingly. So here I am... 6% closer (today) to being a sucker, 0% closer to being a lil bitch

You reminded me of the time I went to the TTs there a couple years ago.... We got there a nit late, and there was no fucking cash on the island. Almost all ATMs were out of money. No cell service, no british pounds, and we had to hike across a city and up a mountain to find an ATM that would work to let us get cash for a bus. 
It sucked. So bad. Crypto would have been a life saver.

It's a deep rabbit hole. The desire for efficiency drives one to spend a moderate amount of time maintaining, researching, monitoring.... That moderate amount of time input is absolutely, in no way, totally not worth the output of a single rx480.
I'd suggest learning more about performance enhancements you can do to improve gaming. Overclocking, optimizing and such. You'll get immediate benefit, and that knowledge will transfer well if you get serious enough about mining to buy a few more cards.

You get trash talked in your comments a lot, but I just want to say thank you for what you do. Labeling your comments as 'hopium' is all the disclaimer you need, and its exactly what I need sometimes. I decided a while back that 2020/21 was my time horizon, I wanted as much wealth as (responsibly) possible in BTC by then, and I'm committed to it. I knew it would:
A) be a very difficult road if BTC went up steadily, and in DEC it looked like I'd barely reach 1 coin ever. 
B) be a very difficult road if BTC dropped hard/stayed super volitile. I'm no trader.
C) be very 'difficult' if BTC skyrocketted before I was ready. Like if I could pay off my house with crypto in 2019, 25 years early, I don't know if I could pass up that opportunity. 
Your hopium makes all three of these scenarios more bearable since I won't be changing my strategy no matter what. It's like anesthesia during surgery. Keep it up, please.

This was it. Surely no one is YOLO shorting right now. There may be traders with small hedges, or a bit short and the rest on the sidelines, but anyone going all in short has to be betting on 0, and that's much less likely than $15k in the next few months.

Maybe not so absolute. Banks may very well find ways to give loans, with interest, in btc. A hybrid loan with a matching futures contract that gives the borrower the option to pay back the loan in fiat value at an extra cost. Similar to mortgage insurance. I mean, they are clever fellows, they'll work out the details. 
And maybe central banks, in the face of a legitimate threat, will get their shit together and figure out a place for themselves actually helping humanity. Again, I know they're smart people. Maybe the responsibility of taxing/spending would be better served by an apolitical, unelected body like the fed. I mean, congress has done a shit job.
I don't have all the answers, but I think the nuances in these possibilities is fascinating.

Simply put, yes. Banks are NECESSARY to interact with national currencies in any meaningful way. Exchanges are NOT NECESSARY to use crypto. They make some aspects easier, and they charge for that, but bitcoin exhanges/service providers have not, nor will ever be able to, insert themselves into the bitcoin ecosystem to the extent that they are unavoidable. If their practices are egregious, there are ALWAYS exchange-free alternatives. They exist, in a very real way, by the grace of their customers; which is not at all true of banks, e.g. there is no bank-free way to pay an employee other than handing over a stack of cash, buying a house without a bank being involved on either side, even if i was 'paying cash,' is laughable.
