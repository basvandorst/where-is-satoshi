Well done. I'm guessing they had good questions, because your answers were more detailed than they would have been for the western media's typical questions.

We've added to that number over the past month with  I see running a full node as cheap insurance for my bitcoin. How many people would run a node if it was as easy as plug and play, and without the complication of mining pools?

We are working hard on improving our Mini project. We are open source and encourage people to develop on it. We are built on nodejs so potentially adding functionality is as easily as npm install (our goal). PM me for more info, or ask in r/bitcoinmini. Ty

False. Blockchain analysis in respect to identity will decrease over time. Of course there are those people that will still use tracking programs by default, but a large number of the concerned types mentioned in the article will be anonymous by default.

Hi masterzman,
Bitcoin Mini is a bitcoin full node for those that want to support the network, and build decentralized apps. We hope to put a node in every home, makers group, and university. You can check us out at 
The Mini is built on open source hardware and software. It's a raspberry pi, but it's more than just a rasp pi node, the Mini is a plug-and-play node with a GUI, and we are quickly building a suite of apps to run on the server on the Mini. We do all the work and you just plug it in at home. By using a Mini, you are decentralizing the network, while getting access to basic bitcoin apps.
Thanks for you comment.
