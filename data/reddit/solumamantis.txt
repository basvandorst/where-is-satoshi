Hi  - Yes, my issue was resolved. I deposited on Wednesday, and only on Sunday evening, suddenly I was allowed to withdraw the whole balance. 
On Monday I got an answer from support, telling me to send me the photo holding my passport (which I had already done twice!!!) and since they didnt have the photo, they were decreasing my credit deposit to a mere USD20!
I answered them telling them that they are a shady company and closed my account with them!!
Do not work with them, guys!

Just want to add my 2cents here regarding coinbank.
I recently registered and got verified all the way to level 4. I registered my credit card and deposited, from my cc, 5000 USD.
Then, I proceeded to buy BTC. After buying btc and seeing it in my balance, I wanted to withdrawal it elsewhere, outside coinsbank.
The system wouldn't allow me. The withdrawal function was disabled. I created a support ticket and 24 hours later they answered, telling me that my credit card deposit was still under approval and that I must be patient.
Why the f**k would you allow me to buy bitcoin with my credit card deposit if it's still under approval - I wonder?
It's been 4 days now since I bought the BTC and I still can't withdrawal. I am still waiting for support to come back to me as to why the approval is not done? The credit card charge is already on my account.
So, to sum it up, I don't recommend CoinsBank - have already warned all my friends in Australia to stay way. Our business, this shady company will not have!
