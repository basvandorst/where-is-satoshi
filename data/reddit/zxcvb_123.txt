Poor return?  Please, tell me how you would get a better one--*and then start your hedge fund.*
Compared to what?  Gold, real estate, forex trading, options, bonds?
Or bitcoin (lol)?
Tax issues vary, depending on what type of account you have, be it Roth IRA, regular IRA, 401k, etc.
But if you trade in bitcoin--you're taxed at a normal capital gains tax rate.  And you can't put bitcoin in a retirement account now, can you?
There's also no company matching for the money you put into bitcoin.
Discounting the importance of  dividends is also absurd, btw.
edit: syntax on last line about dividends

WRONG.  Plus, he's using selective date choices from the peak of a bubble until now.  (and it's still 1.87%, adjusted for inflation)
None of you guys know anything about CAGR, dividend reinvestment, etc. There's a startling amount of financial illiteracy here--perhaps that's why you think bitcoin is great investment relative to the stock market.
EDIT: you can play around with the years, but it's been empirically shown that the equities are the best investment for everyone over time
edit 2: typos, was on phone earlier; and added line
edit 3: more corrections

You missed my point.  It's a great return, relative to all other investments for people who are investing for their retirements.
CTRP?  And I'm sure you're well versed in the company specifics, right?
I suspect you trade stocks like bitcoin and baseball cards.  Have you looked at a single financial statement from CTRP?
You can gamble on stocks. You'll make some money, quite a lot at times--but just like going to a casino--you're going to lose (negative return) overall.
And definitely don't try to pick individual stocks when if you can't even interpret or have the time to look at the financial statements for a given company.
edit: 1% charge per annum, btw?  what is that?  hedge funds charge 2%, and that's because they're actively managed.   An S&amp;P ETF like Vanguard (VOO), has a fee of 0.05%:

You're absolutely incorrect and have no idea about CAGR, dividend reinvestment, etc.
Plus, you're using selective date choices from a bubble peak until now.
And guess what?  You'd still have a 1.87% return from 2000 till now, adjusted for inflation.
Go play around with it.
And waste your money on bitcoin.

Price volatility is incredibly important. It discourages businesses from adopting Bitcoin. Why would I sell X number of widgets at today's equivalent of $1000 in bitcoins if tomorrow those same bitcoins might be worth only $500?
That's a $500 loss for me.
