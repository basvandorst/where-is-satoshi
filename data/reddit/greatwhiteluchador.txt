A government providing services like roads and education is what a gov. Is supposed to do.  Governments around the globe have been doing these things for the past 2000 years.  In what way does that make a case for ubi. No gov has ever done that.

I just don't get it, why do communist want to give my  money to the gov. so badly, if you have such a passion for the poor you should contribute to helping them. How much of your salary do you personally donate to poor people.  I'm not interested.

Yea im not holding my breath for self-drive trucks in the next 75 years, but even if automation is successful sooner the economy will adapt just like it did for the industrial revolution, and every other major advance or change in the economy. New jobs will appear old ones will disappear.  Ubi is not practical and would result in disasterous effects on any economy and country.

Yes but they're not applicable to his argument they are outliers to the data.  To use them as example of someone still working after they made it rich does not apply to the population

Life is litterally not fair, ubi is just communism dressed in hippy clothing.

Lunar processing facilities will be the way, anyone who counterdicts this point a view doesn't understand mined  gold processing at all.

Damn I can't think of anything more scientific sounding than 'quantum entanglements' to continue the chain

Nahh you just crash the astroid in to the Moon and process it at the lunar processing facility.

Why do I have to go through the trouble of requesting my money back for a short phone call.  This entire idea is rediculous and would never work
