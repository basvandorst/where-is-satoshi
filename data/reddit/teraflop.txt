"Eventually consistent" means that any one operation will eventually succeed or fail everywhere. It emphatically does *not* mean that when multiple operations are happening, the overall result will eventually converge to something reasonable. 
I suspect you already know this, but it's hard to read sarcasm over the internet.

If you read [the actual explanation]( instead of second-hand reporting, the point is not that the attacker can fake an error message. The point is that *if* they can intercept and MITM your SSL connection, they can almost certainly *also* intercept and block your OCSP requests. And it's not reasonable for the browsers to disallow connections if OCSP fails, since the CA could be inaccessible for any number of reasons. 
So it really only adds a trivial barrier to an attacker, and has the downside of compromising both performance and privacy.

Many news sources are reporting that, but it'd not that simple. If you read the actual indictment, the murder-for-hire charges are included as elements of the narcotics trafficking conspiracy charge, of which he was convicted.

Are you saying that's a good thing? Do you think I'm saying it's a good thing? Because I'm not.


My comment had nothing to do with right and wrong. 
You were responding to someone who claimed that the idea of a Bitcoin owner accumulating wealth indefinitely without any active participation in the economy seemed unsustainable. You made a comparison to the steady progression of technology, which is entirely unrelated. I was criticizing that comparison, nothing more or less.
But OK, since you want to talk about inflation and retirement savings, then my position would be that as a free economic agent, you have the ability to choose what you think is the most suitable investment. If you invest in index funds and bonds, your money will (extremely likely) gain value slowly. If you remove yourself from active participation in the economy and hoard your money, your savings will be outpaced by the rest of the economy and lose value. If you "invest" your money in loaves of bread and gallons of milk, all your value will be gone in a matter of weeks instead of decades. It's a continuum.
And if you're going to be responsible for your own investments, then you have to decide which investments have long-term growth potential, and which ones are fueled by short-term speculative bubbles. That's why talking about "sustainability" matters.

Are you for real?
Moore's law is not a fact of nature, and technology doesn't materialize out of nowhere. Phones are getting more powerful because of the work of many thousands of hardware and software engineers around the world. Technology only improves because they do their jobs, and they can only make a living at those jobs because they get paid. And they only get paid because they build things that people actually go out and buy.
How is that the same as buying some coins, sitting on them for a decade or so and becoming fabulously wealthy, with no effort and no actual productive activity?

You don't seem to understand what's going on here. If someone uses a stolen credit card or bank account to buy Bitcoins, and then does a chargeback, then Coinbase loses money. So Coinbase uses anti-fraud algorithms to reject suspicious-looking transactions, and sometimes those algorithms guess wrong. It has nothing to do with government regulations.

I wasn't talking about the incendiary thing (though it's kind of hilarious). I'm talking about the fact that his book claims to be a legal way to avoid paying taxes, when empirically, it clearly isn't. How many times do you have to see phrases like "We have repeatedly rejected arguments [...] asserting that private sector employment income is not subject to federal taxation" before it sinks in?
[Here's a federal district court opinion that I picked more or less at random;]( lots of juicy counterarguments and references to established case law debunking the scheme. If I were considering using *Cracking the Code*, and I wanted to predict whether it would work, I'd probably do better by looking at its track record in court than by listening to the guy trying to sell it to me for $24.95.
Look, if you have a moral objection to paying income tax, that's fine; good luck with your revolution. But don't kid yourself into thinking you've found a loophole, and then put your fingers in your ears going "lalala" when it turns out to be a bunch of BS.

Most miners keep a queue that's sorted by the ratio of transaction fee to transaction size (in bytes). So if you create a transaction with no fee, it'll always be at the bottom, but it could still be included if there aren't enough other transactions to completely fill up a block without it. The "position in queue" that blockchain.info gives you is its own estimate based only on the transactions it's seen; there's no "official" queue that it's monitoring.
Now, it's quite likely that most miners have some kind of timeout after which they'll forget about old transactions. But there's no way to know if that's true of *all* miners, and each block has a chance of being generated by any miner in the network. The point is that you can't know with certainty that your transaction will never be executed, unless you create another transaction from the same source that preempts it.

Huh, interesting. 
Still, scrypt requires far more chip resources per hashing unit than SHA-256 does. I'll reserve judgment until they release more concrete numbers, but 500 khash/sec for one chip is only double what my (not particularly high-end) GPU can do. Compare that to Bitcoin ASIC miners of the same form factor, which can outpace a top-of-the-line GPU by something like three orders of magnitude for only about 10 times the cost.

You can't rely on that "transaction failed" message, though. The transaction was broadcast to the network with your signature attached to it. In principle, there could be any number of miners that still remember that transaction and could potentially include it in blocks that they mine. So unless you create a different transaction that spends the coins from that address, they could get transferred without notice at any time.

It depends on whether mtgox still has the private key corresponding to that address. If I were them, I would never throw away those keys, but who knows what they actually do.
In any case, the transaction that you used is dependent on the hash of a particular preceding transaction. So if you haven't used your wallet since then, send some coins from your wallet to one of your own addresses, and I think you should be fine. Otherwise, yes, as I understand it that transaction could go through at any time. (Admittedly, the chance is pretty small, since you'd think if that transaction was going to show up it would have done so by now.)

I'm really curious about this -- what is there for kids to spend BTC on at the moment? Do they just convert it into Amazon gift cards or something?
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:48:15
The main benefit I see of Litecoin is that it's resistant to ASIC mining. So there's much less risk of it ending up in the situation Bitcoin is in, where cost-effective mining requires a big up-front capital investment, causing mining to become more and more centralized.
I don't know if that's a good enough reason to support Litecoin long-term, given how much momentum Bitcoin already has. But as a purely pragmatic matter, mining LTC on my GPU and trading it for BTC is currently vastly more profitable than mining BTC directly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:56:59
Yes, in the event of a network partition, each side would continue its own diverging fork of the block chain. When they were rejoined, the longer fork would immediately take precedence.
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean transactions would be lost. In the normal case, each unspent output would only be accessible from one side of the partition, so a transaction spending it would still be considered valid on the other branch. And miners would have an incentive to incorporate these transactions into new blocks after the fork is resolved, in order to gain the transaction fees. What I don't know is whether miners are actually coded to watch for orphan branches and apply their transactions to the main branch. It certainly seems like they should.
Also, anyone with access to both sides of the partition could easily carry out a double spend attack by spending the same output on both sides. After rejoining, the transaction on the shorter chain would become invalid. This would probably make people very reluctant to trust payments on the minority partition.

It doesn't have to be deliberate. A multi-page document could easily be too big to store in the copier's memory, so the software is probably designed to just buffer everything to disk.

No. Java has a sandboxed mode, which is what applets normally use, and an unsandboxed mode, which allows the same level of access that any other program running on your computer has. This is by design, and it's the way Java has worked for over 15 years.
The prompt is asking if you want to allow the applet to leave the sandbox; note the phrase "This application will run with unrestricted access." If you click "no" then the applet doesn't run.

The benefit is hypothetical and indirect, but the more dependent the mining network is on a lot of small distributed nodes instead of a few big players, the more resilient it should be to various kinds of attacks.
It's commonly said that market forces will tend to keep the profits of miners near zero in the long run. But for people who can't afford the most power-efficient hardware, that profit will always tend to be negative, so they'll drop out of the market. Which means it's in everyone's interest to prefer a system in which the top tier of hardware capability is accessible to as many people as possible.

If transferring coins from one address to another is enough to clean the "stolen" flag, then anybody who steals them can trivially launder them.

The parent comment said "don't be a criminal" and then you said "you don't need to report it," so I assumed you were talking about legality. 
You wouldn't have to pay taxes on a $5,000 gift because it falls under the $14,000 annual gift exclusion, but ~~you're still legally required to report it. If you don't, you'd better cross your fingers and hope you never get audited.~~ EDIT: I'm wrong, you only have to include it on your return if it exceeds the annual exclusion.

Sure, you can design an ASIC to do anything. However, scrypt requires much more memory per hashing unit than SHA-256, so you can't fit as many of them onto a die. The end result is that the efficiency gain is much less dramatic -- last time I ran the numbers, it was maybe an order of magnitude faster than a GPU, compared to the ~1000x speedup provided by Bitcoin ASICs.
