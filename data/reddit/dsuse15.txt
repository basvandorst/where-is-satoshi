Thank you!! 
You seem a bit bitter. I'm sorry my single example made you upset. 
I've been doing this for a long time, with different assets, then BTC and plenty of Alts. With a good trading plan, you don't have to rely on chance or luck to be successful.
If you're interested, there are a ton of resources out there for learning technical and fundamental analysis. If you're not interested, try not to shit on people you don't know on the internet. The world will be a better place.
Take it easy.

You guys realize that you can continously buy range bottoms and sells tops, right? You can be making money right now.

Yes, exactly.  ಠ_ಠ

Firstly, I'm not sure where you assumed day trading from my post. In the last couple of weeks, BTC dropped to $10000, went up to $17000, dropped to $9000, then back up to $13000. That's 2 trades. It's just smart financially if you have the ability to pull it off.
Secondly, the liquidity of BTC has never been an issue for me. More people trading increases liquidity and, to be honest, the more volatile the market, the more you can make at certain times. That's why Cryptopia's charts have more gaps and are more messy than Bittrex's for example.
Lastly, who says I don't trade other assets?
Try not to assume so much from a single post if you can avoid it.

Please explain how the millions of people who trade on exchanges harm the network. I'm genuinely curious. Most transactions within exchanges are off-network unless they are deposits or withdrawals, no? Or am I misinformed.
Markets are important to financial assets and can act as a correction mechanism for finding value, etc. Especially things like the CME futures. Could you please detail your concerns and correct and misunderstandings I may have?
