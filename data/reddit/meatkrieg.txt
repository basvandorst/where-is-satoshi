You're probably right but this isn't helping me plan for a better future. It took me until last year to pay off those loans. Unless you have more insight into bitcoin development pathways please head to r/ITT.

No offense but I align with most of what ancaps are all about. This is just some fancy trustfund baby that had a girlfriend fucked by a Marine. Somehow I struck a nerve with this snowflake ��

For now I'm doing the pre-req's for computer science. Just a small accredited school but I plan to transfer.

Yes they did. CEET, Computer &amp; Electronics Engineering Technology. It was a 2 year associate program and I had an internship with Volvo before they merged with Mack trucks or whatever. This was in 2008/9. ITT was criminal organization that preyed on low income students. 
Aside from that I do appreciate the tips. I've watched all the Princeton lectures and I am okayish in C++. I'll look into JSongs course! Thank you.

At the end of the day the GI Bill pays me to go to school. The monthly housing stipend may or may not be allotted into my current crypto hodlings.

Imagine if you focused your hatred on making the world a better place ☺

No offense taken! I'm not an ancap but at the same time government and central banks need to go.

Thank you! Yes, I agree that conventional educational systems are not caught up yet. That being said, I have the post 9-11 GI Bill to pay for 36 months of school and I turn 28 in a few months. I just want to get a degree before I'm 32-one that will help me in the future in regards to this space.
Teaching yourself online is definitely the way to go, I will continue to do this. However, most jobs require a degree over my word ��

Yes. Exactly. Also, try not to shit on everyone else trying to help. We're all in this together.

You need to relax brother. Life isn't as serious as you want it to be.

It's time to get up u/lizard450, you've lived to see another day. Get up, lick the cheetohs off your fingers push in your arm chair and live life! Don't let the world pass you by because someone hurt you in the past. This too shall pass my friend.
