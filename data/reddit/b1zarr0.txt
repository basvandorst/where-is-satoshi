I think their own ignorance lost them a lot of coins with bad transaction issues and giving what they thought were refunds. Yet I'm pretty sure some big wigs there have walked away with quite a bit of coin one way or another. There was 5 million being sold at once on bitstamp yesterday. Thinking it was some mtgox executives. Imo

Is there any reference to anyone checking their code for malware, and at quick glance I did not see an announcement on Kncminer. 
Any help with this would be appreciated.

Problem is those dollars with a little interest will be worth less value soon. Very soon as the US dollar looks to be collapsing soon.

Discuss news good or bad. But if you don't have financial ties to gox. Let them go and why waste time on anyone spouting mis information for their own gain.

If I could only sell my car tomorrow and buy bitcoin, I would be buying a newer better one in a week or so...

I would find it hard to trust in them after attempting to create bad information to create lower a lower buy price because they made ignorant decisions and attempted to blame the hand that feeds them being the bitcoin protocol. 
Thats as bad as the nyse or any other centralized type economy.

In order to run a miner and the "hardware" he had you would have to have some sort of computer running if it was a btc miner. You will have to check that out as well.

I do like the address number as a reference. Interesting thought. I do believe that you are correct that millions know of it, yet are not involved.

What an awesome video to share. Yes 25 or so minutes but very easy to understand. 
This is why we need bitcoin as a store of value and exchange. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:18:24
I think coinbase has something like this already. Would just make sure it has those features and more. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:19:45
There are programmers working on improving the dumbing down of bitcoin by adding layers of apps and plugins and even cards and wallets like the trezor. People will be using bitcoin and not even know it. Which will not matter to the businesses using it because it is better for them and no different for the consumer.

So why imo act like apple? Why not be transparent as so many other crypro biz seem to be?

They "refunded" coins that they really were scammed out of and imo they were the ones dumping 5 million on bitstamp yesterday.

I like the idea is great but it says only 10 downloads. For me a little sketchy yet. I'll wait on this one. Let's hit 1mill dl and I'll be all over this thing.

Beautiful,  but it will burn or get soaked if you ever had a house emergency. Almost could use a tiny water/fire proof safe in there 1st.

Here's your answer. 
I have a job and I buy bitcoin as an investment. 
I mined years ago and I got a lot of bitcoin. 
I believe in it's future. 
I spend bitcoin every chance I get on anyone who sells goods for bitcoin.
You are golden.
It's not a scam it's the future. 
Ty and reopen my accnt.
