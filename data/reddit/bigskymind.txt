Why anyone would trust Kim Dotcom is beyond me.

Bitcoin as the world reserve currency? Don't hold your breath 
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:29:19
And what about the owners of the other coins he's stolen and doesn't know the identity of?

Yeah, if jumping in on a speculative bubble is regarded as a good investment.

Yeah, she remembers her ex-boyfriend talking about bitcoins to buy drugs on Silk Road.

They're just having a laugh, don't take it too personally.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:54:18
It fits better that the US Govt has frozen access to the coins as part of an ongoing Silk Road investigation

Well there was Willy bot helping things along.

Except in this case he never handed CoinBet 20BTC — his balance never changed.
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:33:39
Reimburse him for what? He wagered zero funds on the bet in question.

I don't think Trump actually knows where he stands in an ideological sense. It seems to vary from tweet to tweet.
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:05:49
OP? Pls respond...
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:46:54
So you actually lost 20BTC of your own money?
@_date: 2017-02-07 12:11:33
What a bullshit response to a series of legitimate concerns.
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:50:44
Seems like really poor money management.
LA LA LA.

Don't want your friends seeing what a cheap bastard you are.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:17:36
But why?

@_date: 2015-01-20 05:37:08
Yeah, bitcoin seems to attract crooks.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:09:42
Because the "government" doesn't give a flying fuck about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:32:06
Why would they give you back the 20BTC? You didn't actually wager/lose that amount of money?
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:25:52
Well maybe the price dropping was based on insider trading on the back of this news.
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:55:29
How would they become a "target"?

MMM ponzi in China requires bit-coin as a buy in.

As someone not familiar with the politics of Bitcoin, why is their such vehement opposition the idea that Wright is who he says he is?
I get the sense from many of the comments here that there's a whole agenda over and above whether Wright has adequately demonstrated who he says he is, but don't know what that might be.
