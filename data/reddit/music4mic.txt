Is there any speculation on when they are going to offer their IPO?
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:08:53
Sounds like e-gold and liberty dollars (and we know how those ended), except backed with fiat currency instead of gold.  Dumb idea is dumb for so many reasons.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:19:40
The way they survive, IMO, would be by becoming THE fiat cash ---&gt; BTC provider for those without traditional bank accounts or computer access.  They could then also retain a role in helping those less savvy send/transmit as well.  There will likely be a need for a middle man for a particular demographic for a long time to come and the have the infrastructure to do it.  But if they don't step up, someone else will and they will whiter away.

Was gonna say because guberment, but yours is better.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:32:12
lol.  
I'd take 10/1 odds all 3 die of heart failure in their late 60's.  Who's in?

You could google "Manufactured Spend" for credit cards and get some ideas on how to convert credit to cash without it counting as a cash advance.  it's kind of tricky, could piss off your CC company, but can be done.
Of course, cash could be used to buy on local bitcoin or with any number of other services.

This.  These rules are a laundry list of what the financial epicenter has requested to make it difficult to compete with the status quo.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:58:44
Not sure what you're referring to exactly.  I knew a guy that worked for them, which is how I became aware of them and what they were doing.  I don't think their intent was so different from Satoshi's, but because of the centralized nature if their operations they were doomed from the start.  This being based in conversations I had with the guy.
@_date: 2014-09-21 02:23:57
I can send you a couple of block erupters from the US.  Pm me if you're interested and we will work it out.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:13:24
Here's their FL info, per  (FL incorporation site)
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:32:40
I get excited seeing these central bankers squirm
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:12:56
They were 2 different cases.  I believe with e-gold they may have claimed money laundering and money transmitting laws (as part if the patriot act.)  
With Liberty Dollar they charged him with 
"On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was pronounced guilty of "making, possessing, and selling his own currency"
You can read about it here:

so basically Bill O'Reilly, Chris Matthews, Sean Hannity, etc.
All millionaires btw.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:24:24
That guy is supposed to be French according the director
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:39:09
Guberment seized their assets.  Guberment doesn't like competition.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:40:17
yeh, that's basically what I was saying.  The regs look like a list handed to the regulators, directly from the legacy players.  Not to level the playing field, but to make it so burdensome that it's unlikely that bitcoin can compete at all.  
I was thinking TX as well, but AL and MS are quietly becoming tech meccas .  Also DE and IA might be decent choices.  HK would be another likely choice.
Ultimately though, seems like the solution is going to rely on technology that removes the need for a central pivot, IMHO.
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:52:06
Nope.  Probably because the Vegas (and several other) sanctioned Casinos were throwing hissy fits.  
Certain types of gambling is allowed in various jurisdictions though.  For example, in Florida we have a number of poker rooms and dog tracks.  In FL it varies by county though.
It's not technically illegal though, it's just illegal to transmit money from a bank account to an online gambling fund/account.

He's a better option than Hillary, Rubio, Jebadya or pretty much anyone else that will end up on the ballot.  I'm not a lesser of 2 evils voter- but at the end of the day, he really would do less damage than any of these other clowns.
I wrote off contributing to Rand the minute he endorsed Mitt Romney, but I'll still vote for him in the primary, because the alternatives are Jeb and Rubio...
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:27:22
He's the lead news anchor on NBC nightly news, where all the baby-boomers still get their infos, that recently got caught making up fake stories.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:10:33
All the corporate media does that, it's a matter of getting caught.
@_date: 2013-06-06 23:47:00
came to say this.  I like Mega simply because now that Kim Dotcom has been a victim of the government he centers his work around fighting their intrusion.  He's definitely a friend of the cause.
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:44:56
how long ago was the pump and dump, out of curiosity? 
Do you have a better suggestion for encrypted cloud?
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:32:07
Because ach was instant they couldn't charge for wires
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:41:39
I'm not a KDC advocate or anything, but I do think he's one of the reluctant leaders of privacy fight.
You may have already made up your mind, but in the event that you are interested in reading more than a wikipedia article, give this a read:

lol Krugman Krugman lol, what a shill
@_date: 2013-06-07 16:53:39
Thanks for sharing the article.  According to the article: 


I get what you're saying dude, but they have to play the game to an extent.  Their legal team probably advised them that it was the public distribution of links that got them in so much trouble before, so they are being proactive.  Honestly, I don't blame them...  especially with the original Mega case and his extradition still up in the air.  I don't call this throwing your friends under the bus, I call it playing the game.
Now if you could show me evidence of files being pulled *without* publicly published links, that would be another story entirely IMO.
@_date: 2013-06-07 05:58:13
Yeh, that's kind of my thought too.  I just want the best option, and I like the encryption he offers
@_date: 2013-06-07 07:08:40
Idk... Other than he has to cover his ass legally too. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 15:41:18
I'm having the same issue now.  I've emailed them to find out more, but seems like they removed the option for now.
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:33:40
Why do you say he's a shitty person?  And honestly, that doesn't change the fact that he has an encryption focused service and that that's going to be more resilient to government snooping because of his experience.
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:36:36
TL;DR?  As far I know he's just a business man?  And what is it about his encryption that you wouldn't trust?
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:49:33
Would you mind giving a quick explanation on how you did this (or link to one?)  I've got the Zipmark app and a Bitinstant account.
EDIT:  NM, figured it out and like everyone else that was REALLY fast, like 2 or 3 minutes.
For anyone else confused:
1) Create Account on Bitinstant and Zipmark app
2) On Bitinstant Site, click New Transaction
3) Enter Amount and **select Bank account as funding source.**  For destination choose Mt. Gox or your wallet and enter the wallet address.
4) Agree to terms and click place order.
5) Now on your phone, touch the Capture Zipmark button and scan the QR on your computer screen.
VIOLA!  You're done.  Track the transaction at blockchain.info or just wait for it to hit your account!  It took about 3 minutes for me.
