This week there has been a lot of chat about Greece defaulting on their loans. Hey you Greeks I feel for you &amp; wanted to create a Bitcoin T-Shirt that shows our support. If I sell 100 of these I'll donate 10%, if I sell 200 of these, 15% of profits to a Greek Charity or any suggestions you Redditors may have.
Here is the T-Shirt:

fuck this, 20MB is for the Power Rangers.  This tee is fitting:

This t-shirt is very fitting for this debate.  Why change Block size when there is no scaling issue to date.

I found a sweet tee that is very similar to this one!  Check it out:

This is why I have started to rock this sweet Mircea Popescu tee:

Lolz guys, guys..  I meant that the rest of the world buy the tees, and I send them the BTC!  I'm def not suggesting we fuck em over.  Yes I love BTC,  it's not perfect.... and yes they should work a touch harder.  The idea of the campaign is to help, not to screw em.  Have a good day gents.

Lol this t-shirt is funny and very fitting to the debate:

Thanks dude!
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:49:22
you do save on shipping for multiple tees ordered
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:24:16
they should probably get Tees from  then!  Selling a BTC tee without accepting it is just lazy.  Build a store. Accept BTC.

as of now not yet.  I may offer a coupon code shortly for multiple tees
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:23:28
Lemme know how the tee turns out for you.  I'll send you a coupon for the next one ;)
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:04:42
Hey Eodguy149, if you give me 3 words I'll make you a Tee today ;)

I was thinking a Greek charity,  maybe something around homelessness or family support.

Sqrt7744  Great suggestion.  I'll add it to the change roster.
