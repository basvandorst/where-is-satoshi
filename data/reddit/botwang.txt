Why are you on a throwaway? Are you ashamed of your actions? Or are you really new to reddit and telling us what the community wants?

It isn't Flash, just html, css and JavaScript.

That sentence jumped out at me as well -- it is a masterpiece of misrepresentation, clearly crafted to sway uninformed users rather than providing information and allowing users to make their own decisions. Xapo and the like are stuck in 20th century corporate 'we know better than our customers' mode which will not translate well to a distributed age. They may have some short term success, but will sacrifice long term viability and eventually disappear from the ecosystem.

**DO NOT ORDER USING COINBASE**. Any online pharmaceutical purchase is against their TOS and you will find your account closed. They closed mine the day after I placed an order at modup.net and that was the only activity I had for weeks around that date. I had been a long time customer with many purchases and they closed my account without a qualm. 
I assume Coinbase must have a db of known TOS violation addresses and check transactions against that. If you are taking payments for these items, you may want to look into providing a new payment address for each transaction.
