Same problem.  Every fucking transaction that I have made through BitInstant has failed.  Although they usually resolve it in a day, it has been over that for my most recent transaction.  Two emails and a forum post and I have heard absolutely nothing.  You'd think I would have learned my lesson by now, but I'm waiting on mtgox to verify my account so I don't have to use these clowns any more.

Still unresolved...

Their support is swamped, backed up for days.  Their transactions have been failing left and right.  You'll get your money, but only god knows when.  Use anyone else but BitInstant.  Go through the hoops of getting a verified account at MtGox or somewhere else.
People on their support forums have been waiting days, some weeks.  I've been waiting 2+ days with no answer yet.

Bullshit, don't trust them.  Their open support cases are still increasing, THEY ARE NOT CATCHING UP.  Transactions are still failing left and right yet they refuse to stop taking orders.  It's been over 2 days for me at this point, I finally got an acknowledgement late last night that that I'm on some sort of "list."  That means nothing other than I have a ticket open with them.
Oh and by the way they are manually processing orders at current market value.  Shitty service like this will just be used as an excuse for government regulation.  I urge everyone to avoid BitInstant!
