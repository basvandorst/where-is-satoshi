Or they don't see a future for it in its current unregulated form.

I think you're confusing "Not direct consequence of how bitcoin works" with "not something the bitcoin community should worry about".
I'm fairly certain the average person looks at gox and says "this bitcoin thing seems like a great way to get all your shit stolen". That's *kind* of a problem for the currency's credibility - and that's all that props up the currency in general, perception.

Pretty funny that you have a giant link to the Gox story right on the side there. The upside and the downside.

If you go to Vegas enough you'll see people gamble away their houses etc. Casinos are big business, and bc casinos are the best, because people don't even think they're casinos

I love this sub. So many people going "I mean sure, he has no reason to ever give a cent back, but I'm sure he's a good guy and he'll do it anyway". You guys are adorable.

It's more like bitcoin is the macarena and Buffet is classical.

Same thing happened to all the money I had on my wallet yesterday. I did spend some on food today so I suppose I don't believe in the Dollar dream and am not a supporter of the currency

Not only that, but they say it because it drives up the price of their bc. They're actually being paid to tell you you should invest, in a way. Even if they know about the same as everyone else: nothing.

Sure, if you have so much money that losing a substantial amount makes almost no difference to you.
Most bitcoins are in the hands of a few people, so the market is ridiculously easy to manipulate. And if you look at a simple graph, it's easy to tell it's astoundingly volatile even if it's not being directly manipulated.

Investing in anything that runs the risk of easily losing half it's value overnight is stupid.
