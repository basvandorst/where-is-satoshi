Damn, that's rough. Hope things start looking up for you.

Yeah, if it's higher you end up with Less bitcoins to make up for the fluctuation which makes sense in a way. My question about it the whole coinbase thing is say you buy BTC using their "Get the market value you paid in btcs at the market value of the day they arrive" so if I bought 1 btc for 260 bucks and BTC dropped to 100 bucks does that mean I'll get 2.6 btc's because I agreed to get my value of BTC's at the future exchange rate. Not sure if this made sense but I've been wondering it for a few days now.

You're way too invested in this Subreddit. Nothing on the internet should have this much emotion involved in it. I'd hate to see you on facebook bro.

It really is sometimes. I feel like I'm on /b/ when I go through it. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:54:43
I know this feeling. Just stay low for a little while longer. Hopefully it keeps dropping so I can get a chance to buy a large amount of coins. Gonna go on a buying spree as soon as I can withdraw money from my Bank Account. Keep your fingers crossed Ladies and Gentlemen.

Sarcasm escapes you doesn't it?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:17:02
Well fuck. I thought I finally got to call someone out on missing sarcasm, yet failed again. 
One of these days.

Actually it is a good time to buy. It's a way better time to buy then at 260 each. So many people bought at the peak and lost money when they panic sold. Buying now and holding them for a while is a good plan IMHO. Just don't freak out if they drop again and sell. Welcome to the BTC game.

If OP learns from it then it could be a great life lesson albeit a very expensive lesson. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:06:13
That makes complete sense, thank you for clearing this up for me.

If you already have the laptop and the electricity is cheap then go right ahead, just look at it as a part of your hobbies and not a way to supplement income and you should be good. Maybe I'm wrong but if you have the means to do it then what does it hurt to give it a shot? Good luck m8.

I don't, not with all the people who have been telling them not to all day. I'm actually grateful to the people who sold, I got a good bit of BTC rather cheap due to the panic and the mass amounts of people selling. Here's to hoping they learned their lessons.

I wouldn't be thanking Chase, BTC is rising again. Should have made this post a few hours ago my man. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:16:14
I would say buy, prices have dropped which means it's a good time to buy. I just bought 1.5 btc's with some extra cash I have just because the prices dropped. Like anything, don't spend money you can't afford to lose though mate. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:32:46
Ahh I see, well good luck to you my man. I think you'll be safe for the next few days.

Welcome to online Gambling. Glad I got the fuck out of that shit a long time ago.

I've heard this story multiple times from multiple people but am strapped when it comes to finding a reliable source on this info. If this is true then the price will likely go up once buying starts happening again. Either way, I have some extra cash I can piss away so I'm buying while people are selling so low in hopes I can take advantage.
