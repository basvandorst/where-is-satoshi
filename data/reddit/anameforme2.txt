gyft might still accept bitcoin and you can buy yourself a gift card to a restaurant, I did that in 2014 or 2015

Roger Ver...didn't he revoke his citizenship...  He's like the creep that breaks up with an S.O. then spy's on them constantly.  Go away already!

You missed my point...he chose to leave and now he needs to shut the hell up.

Because with bitcoin everyone has to have access to internet, computer (phone or otherwise) and safe offline storage.  Seems cumbersome, so I was trying to understand why it had to be that way and if there was an alternative that offered all bitcoin offers with out the draw backs.
I really am a noob in that I haven't reviewed any other coins or the side chains, I'm not a programmer, nor am I the most genius person that ever lived.  If there's a better way to handle money and all the issues that go with it I'll jump on board.  I have played with the buying/selling bitcoin because I'm not afraid to try a new idea and be wrong.  But I'm not convinced, yet, that it will take over the world.
I'm not sure decentralizing is a great way to go as it doesn't really improve the speed, from a consumers point of view (paying with cash or credit card is still faster).  What do you think?

lol, if I knew how I might just so people could have some fun, it'd be better than deleting it and maybe I'd learn something - besides the obvious 'don't be stupid'

Thank you! Last tip I received went to the movie about bitcoin that just came out: [The End of Money As We Know It.](
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:09:54
That and scarcity. Oh and it's pretty.

I disagree. If I as a consumer can use bitcoin with its benefits to purchase a good online and guarantee delivery I will. Bitcoin is improving and with an escrow service that pays out once shipment is verified  (like with a ups tracking number ) it will be better than the current system.

Hey thanks for doing this, really appreciate it!

Okay, I've seen examples of 1,2,3 and 4.  However, I would hesitate to say that is why bitcoin is around and the centralized attempts are not when bitcoin is only 6 years old...I'll hold my judgement for a few more years.
But just because the centralized models have failed in the past, do you think it's possible to build a centralized model that is better than all the previous models?
I really appreciated the comments about censorship resistance and links as it really drove home why we need a decentralized version.  Or, if not a decentralized one, a centralized one that is impervious to these types of manipulation.
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:04:22
That, kind internet stranger, is a strong, strong, argument for decentralization. Thank you.

@_date: 2015-08-03 14:49:55
Thanks, I haven't looked into sidechains yet.  I was just curious why one central place couldn't be responsible for recording the transactions without the ability to prevent/approve them.  Like an automatic ledger that is open to all but not everyone has to download it to secure it.  Downloading would be available to all at any time (i.e. review). Bitcoin's not anonymous anyways, that will always be a barrier to buying things that are banned or preferred private.

I understand but talking about space mining devaluing gold or asteroids hitting the earth tends to make people scoff.  Start easy, not crazy.

Unfortunately, I live in the great united states where we have the best internet in the world.../s internet at my house is marginally better than dial up, so I only use my phone.  So much anger over here about not being able to set up a node.  I tried for two weeks to download the blockchain using my phone as a hot spot...because of desperation.  It's led to nothing but despair.

I won't regret it...I can't do anything, so I'm sure I'll appreciate your words.  But don't you think coinbase being down is really bad for bitcoin when there's so much attention on it (newbies hearing about it)?
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:09:34

Move to a state that has the shift card, pay loans with visa debit card.

It costs money to move it from your wallet to your piggy bank to...wherever.
Your transactions are public
It's volatile
you can be robbed blind and there is no recourse, you won't necessarily know until you look it up, and it could be stolen by a random person in a random country.
If you run out of power you can't transact
You have to have multiple computing devices to use it0

I believe the separation of money and state will be as profound as the separation of church and state.
