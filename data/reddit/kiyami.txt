I don't have a link to the segment on Conan, if that's what you're referring to. I tried to find it but no luck.

what term would you use for bitcoin? magic money fridge? I assumed that was a joke, no?

Ideally I'd like to buy it, and then a company acquire mt gox and pay me my full bitcoin - which is possible, especially if they limit withdrawals and begin to reimburse the users with their trading fees.

I counted 67. So like $38k, no?

lol I told myself the same thing when I bought a few bitcoins @ $40 early last year :-)

Do you know which exchange is now considered the safest? I like coinbase, but don't like buying there when I have to wait a week for my coins (when I want to buy more than $1k worth on a given day)

yes, how?

I have a silver &amp; gold 2013 casascius coin, which means I have 1 seven-hundredths of all in existence, so I have that going for me, which is nice :-)

I think with bitcoin we've all taken risks, and it's not fair to come down on the people who lost money as if it were their own fault.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:40:15
haha, okay well I'm so tempted. I signed up and even sent $60 in bitcoins there.

I bought a .999 Silver casascius coin for $2000 when bitcoin was at $1,100.
Now, Bitcoin is at $500 and my Casascius coin still sells for $2,000 on ebay.
I saw it as a way of hedging my bet at the time, and I was right. 
I bet even if bitcoin went to $0, that my Casascius coin would still hold most of its value. But if Bitcoin goes to $3k, then my coin will be worth a minimum of $3k. 
The fact that you see so few on ebay, compared with the 25k in circulation, tells me that people are holding these w/ no intention of selling. Check eBay sometimes you'll find a deal. 
I can't think of a better way to hedge your bet on bitcoin.

My thoughts lie somewhere between yours and Las Vegas!
