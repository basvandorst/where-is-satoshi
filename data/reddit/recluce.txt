Private party sales of cannabis in Colorado are not legal. You must be licensed by the state to sell legally. (Not that this stops anyone.) You can, however, give it away to anyone over 21.

QR codes are resistant to only certain kinds of degradation, like some of the dots being scratched off a sticker. There is a bit of redundancy built in that can correct for that, but stretching/warping of clothing is not really one of these things. QR codes on clothing/skin/etc. are impractical at best.

There are a multitude of companies dedicated to finding infringing content and filing DMCA takedown notices for copyright infringement. Hunting "down each individual user who puts this up" is largely automated with audio and video fingerprinting. You will never make it disappear from the internet, but you sure can make a lot of people on facebook and youtube have a bad day with very little to no human effort.

You should probably not allow images to be loaded by default.

I guess you've never heard of the "rubber-hose" attack. Are you gonna let someone chop off your toes and rape your children, or are you gonna tell them the password to your money?

LOL, what a terrible analogy. That's not how any of this works. Bitcoin pricing is not approximately equivalent to a human life in any way.

Jokes aside, yes, it's in the dictionary. It has a centuries long history as [a pejorative term for copyright infringement]( But equating copyright infringement to Captain Hook thieving booty on the high seas under threat of physical violence makes it seem like more serious of a crime.

If you're gonna be pedantic about it, it's copyright infringement. Piracy involves boats and oceans and pirates with hooks for hands and peg legs.

Can we get some with flamethrowers?

DEF CON is cash only.

You must be new here.
@_date: 2013-07-24 22:04:23
Did you really just call the founder of DEF CON a script kiddie? That's funny.

You expect someone to operate it for free?

Google and Facebook provides services for "free" because it drives traffic to their revenue generating ads. It's very much *not* free. You and your personal information are what is being sold.
Even if this hypothetical entrepreneur creating this auction site worked for free, he'd still have to pay the bandwidth and hosting bill somehow. So unless some Bitcoin Billionaire is going to fund it indefinitely out of altruism, it needs to earn revenue one way or another.
Personally I'd rather pay a small fee than be inundated with ads and have my personal profile sold to marketers.

This kinda sounds like you want to start an actual war with some extremist Christians. This is the Mark of the Beast they've been warning us about!

Stuff like lawsuits, unfortunately.

Yeah I could make one too, I was just wondering if such a thing existed already.

Does blockchain.info provide a ticker widget you can embed?

The rules are enforced by the consensus and proof of work the miners are doing. The miners are doing all the work, and your bitcoin client is basically just watching what's happening.
All the individual clients can verify that things correct according to the rules they expect, but they have no real effect on the block chain other than sending transactions into it. Your client is not helping enforce the security of the block chain by contributing hashing power to the network.
If, for example, a majority of the miners collectively decided to change the rules somehow, but the clients rules weren't updated to match, the individual bitcoin clients would probably notice something was amiss, but they can't do anything about it.
