@_date: 2018-01-17 22:14:22
 (CBOE expired today; today's auction at gemini is the settlement price) shows today's auction was ~$6.72M volume (big outlier from previous ones).
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:09:48
I tend to agree at this point. A post-expiry bounce is more likely than a pre-expiry dip. Of course, futures traders may have already hedged completely (locked in) their Jan contracts and are free to start buying whenever. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:31:52
So did everyone forget about the futures? Exactly a month ago everyone was flipping their shit and now that the first contract ever expired, no one cares? Even with the crash happening the day before?
Some happy wall street folks today! From here.. the price will still be manipulated but not as drastically as for this contract.
CME redux (today was CBOE) coming up end of month?
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:14:31
Yeah, that's a wrinkle that wall street may not have accounted for.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:10:42


Were we not right? Futures were ~$18.5k and now BTC is at ~$11k, lol. Of course I'm not sure on the volume for futures over time.. Or are you referring to folks that think BTC will be manipulated going forward like gold allegedly is?
BTC price should rebound a bit after tomorrow's expiration. From that point there is no play that was as obvious as the one-off of buying BTC at less than &lt;$10k and selling futures at $18k..
Cash settled is regrettable, but we can view it as a side bet where the bettors can excessively influence the outcome (so long as they have oodles of $$$).
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:27:23
This has been the drop we were all worried about exactly a month (and change..) ago (stay tuned for CME one?). Basically that the easy play for the futures was for wall street to buy BTC early, sell futures, and then use the BTC to crash the price (to get their futures far into the green). Thus a double profit.
 shows today's auction was ~$6.72M, I think the highest ever and an outlier (please someone graph them all for us?).
Or it's just a coincidence?
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:03:26
It's purely based on which side is willing to stake the most money to push their contracts the most green. Obviously they should already have a reserve of BTC from a month+ ago if they want the price to go down (any further).
To me, it looks like the "wall street will push BTC down with the futures" has either already happened or will happen in the next 24 hours. I anticipate a bounce right after contracts expire.

Miners have preferences other than maximizing fees. For instance, maybe they prefer to block some transactions and accelerate others, independent of fees.

No way OP would be converting to USD before the tax-event donation. I doubt OP wants to donate to the Feds. Of course, OP will end up donating USD, so OP probably donated the BTC to "Pineapple Fund" who then does the conversion tax free.

I guess.. I don't think you can do it retroactively and I don't like to use it proactively because it sends more signal/intent than I would like. Honestly I don't know why it's a feature (i think a node policy to be OK w/ replacing an identical mempool transaction if new one has a higher fee would work?)
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:51:19
If you can't wait forever for it to settle or drop completely, doublespend w/ a higher fee should work, assuming it is no longer in too many nodes' mempools (I think blockcypher.com gives an estimate).

You may want to look into OTC exchanges. People may also be willing to pay a premium on directly mined coins, but that would require some legwork, I think.

It's pretty much (being the exchange) the only easy way to handle it. No one wants to go set up an account somewhere and wait days for verification and all that crap.
I would still recommend giving them the private key in case they wanted to actually use the BTC. Just be sure to have a backup.

Personally I think Coinbase is avoiding LN because they don't want to work with BitPay. Coinbase&lt;-&gt;BitPay is the most common retail situation so would benefit consumers/merchants greatly if they could work together.. as it is today it is the most expensive Bitcoin transaction you can do.
I did a Coinbase&lt;-&gt;Coinbase the other day and it was instant and free (it was to a 501c3 which Coinbase waives any fees of their own).
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:41:17
On the whole, I like the capability to revoke* or replace a transaction from nodes with some decent assurance. It's nice that we might have a standard/cooperative way of doing this with something like RBF.
[*] I guess that's not a feature yet/planned? Probably a good reason, but it's identical to just replacing a transaction to pay yourself sooo... just a UI thing? Should I pitch that as a feature/PR to some wallets or Core?
However, currently the choice to opt-in RBF may leak some intent. For instance, maybe nodes/miners will de-prioritize "nSequence &lt; maxint" transactions (unless they have a higher than usual fee or they record that the fee has been increased at least once, etc.) in the hope that it will cause people to pay higher fees? One might think up a few other implications as well.
I can't help but think there will be alternate solutions, eventually (if they don't exist already behind closed doors.. transaction acceleration for a fee/charity is already a thing).. more complex policies regarding mempool state (perhaps in addition to transactions to accelerate? basically levels of assurance from miners..) for miners seems somewhat inevitable.
I also wouldn't mind if transaction replacement was possible without increasing mining fees.. if nodes could just be accommodating/nice. In this case you could use a counter to indicate your preferred transaction. Granted, this would make "double-spending 0-conf" even easier/cheaper, technically speaking.

My theory is that soon exchanges will be aplenty in each country since the major hurdle is mostly bureaucratic and seed capital, not technical. And with so many dispersed exchanges the liquidity will be there, mostly in the form of arbitragers. Further, something like Buttercoin may be creating a turn-key solution for DIY exchanges.
GOX fiasco of April 2013 triggered a lot of movement in this area, but again, the major hurdle is the regulations and seed money.

It's a free market. Do what you want.
There are a lot of other people out there trading so the buy/sell spread for BTC/USD is fairly low. Hence, you would have to have a really large bankroll to be able to manipulate the BTC/USD market (smaller caps/volume are more susceptible to manipulation).

Actually it is working well. Everything in the blockchain is valid and secure (moreso the older the block is).
When proof of work wouldn't (practically) work would be when there are volatile swings in hash rate that the algorithm can't adjust for fast enough.

I've always thought to myself, selling insurance for bitcoins has got to be pretty low on the risk scale (and a cash cow) if:
1. you can you demand deposit of the bitcoins to an address you have the key for
Would be a nice entrepreneurial exercise to open your own crypto bank (secure storage) or consulting given how turn-key it should be (p.s. where's the code for such a turn-key crypto bank? I only know of [this project]( 3 months with no commit).
On the other hand, I also see where this is a valuable service. I would have itchy fingers if I weren't an advanced computer user and wanted to secure a large sum of BTC with some deposit insurance.

Great response! But I would add that a crypto-currency that could achieve a similar blockchain without sucking down so much electricity would be very desirable. Sure **BTC mining doesn't take that much electricity today, but what about in 2016/2017?** *Peercoin* is the popular alternative addressing this issue. There is some valid criticism to peercoin, but a PoS-based alternative in some shape may be the more fit crypto-currency.

Just for some perspective, [GWP is USD $71.83 trillion]( in nominal terms. 7% of that is $5.03T.
I'm just saying, you may want to think about 2016/2017 when the block reward has been halved (speaking of which, I wonder why the block reward is so discreet) and assuming one BTC is &gt;$10k, and miners only mine if it is profitable to do so, the electricity consumed will be quite high. Electricity cost is the major factor in determining future profitability of mining IMO.
Pulling some numbers out of my butt and this is a drasticly simple back of the napkin math:
    Jan 2014: (($800/BTC * 25BTC/block) * 6 blocks/hr * 24hr) = $2.88M minted per day
    Jan 2015: (($5,000/BTC * 25BTC/block) * 6 blocks/hr * 24hr) = $18M minted per day
    Jan 2016: (($10,000/BTC * 25BTC/block) * 6 blocks/hr * 24hr) = $36M minted per day
    Jan 2017: (($100,000/BTC * 12.5BTC/block) * 6 blocks/hr * 24hr) = $180M minted per day
    Jan 2018: (($1,000,000/BTC * 12.5BTC/block) * 6 blocks/hr * 24hr) = $1,800M minted per day
    Jan 2019: (($10,000,000/BTC * 12.5BTC/block) * 6 blocks/hr * 24hr) = $18,000M minted per day
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:34:48
I'm not so much worried about this as the **possibility of them becoming a sort of gatekeeper to the blockchain**.
With a majority of the hashing power they can effectively control which transactions (aka deny certain ones or prioritize certain ones) get into the blockchain. 
**Example 1**: GHash.io central authority decides the Satoshi coins are too much of a risk to bitcoin ecosystem (read: GHash.io wealth) so they silently block any Satoshi transaction from getting into the blockchain (though obviously there would be a public transaction out there signed by Satoshi and people would flip there shit)
**Example 2**: s/Satoshi/usmarshals
**Example 3**: Deny competitor transactions.
**Example 4**: You want a fast lane to your transaction? Just pay this monthly fee and rest assured you won't be left standing awkwardly at the checkout as blocks pass your transaction by! (actually didn't Satoshi kind of sell this point as a good thing? Though I guess he didn't want it to be &gt;50%)
**Solution?** Well, an anonymous cryptocoin would be really good. Though those are not in reach yet. Otherwise you need to convince miners to not collude.
Time to let the free market work. (or not).

HW would need a secure path and you would need some secure execution of the SW stack interacting with this stuff. Otherwise other software can MITM.
Stuff like this does exist but it's not very popular yet. In fact, the existing solutions out there that provide a TEE are better than a Trezor in a lot of ways (and in some ways not) but I guess they are not well known (and not open source).
This google project makes developing secure drivers (that are part of TEE) interesting since previously it is assumed only silicon vendor or OEM would develop a secure driver and the driver would be vetted by the TEE vendor (since driver has a lot of power).

I think the mining is just a side-effect, convenient add on, why not? Adds to the story.
A ton of SoCs in smartphones for example already have SHA256 acceleration, but to use it either requires a specific integration (allow linux to use them) or more commonly ability to execute authorized, "secure" code (be a silicon vendor, OEM, or partner with Trustonic/OEM/silicon vendor). Hell, ARMv8 has SHA2-256 built-in (and maybe silicon vendors see BTC mining acceleration/21 module as a new piece of IP that adds value??).
Not sure how much more 21 and friends plan to work on the silicon level in regards to mining..
If you are going to have some crypto accelerators there already, use them if it's rational.

Add the option to buy BTC before instead of after, please. LIFO accounting would get better tax treatment (I mean, you pay no capital gains tax on the 1BTC you just bought and then spent).

I am hunting a used vehicle on craigslist now and I am seeing how difficult it is to securely exchange value between two parties without Bitcoin. Here is what I will end up doing:
    carry enough cash to pay for the vehicle
      huge target on myself travelling with cash or showing up with that much cash
      how do I even get that much cash? I bank online and don't have a brick and mortar
      if I were the seller I would be worried about counterfeiting
      a lot of physical danger
    get a certified/cashier's check to pay for the vehicle
      apparently my online banks can send one in the mail for a $20 fee (and 24hr+ delay)
      if I were the seller I would be worried about counterfeiting
      how does seller deposit the check or how long to wait for it to clear?
      some wasted money, a lot of wasted time
     
     
With Bitcoin it's like impossible-to-counterfeit cash except that cash happens to be locked up in a digital Ft. Knox in my pocket (or encrypted in the cloud). Good dis-incentive/prevention for opportunistic muggers/scammers.
Not to mention the possibility of creating some fancy conditional transaction (like using an arbiter in case the 2 of us don't agree on the transaction, or even fancier).
Not to mention if all this stuff was already baked into the world around us (picture the car's cryptographic key/ownership being transferred to me after my bits are received by the seller's public address, or vice versa).

don't see why not. and to take it further, each device owner (who is this? silicon vendor, 21, OEM, consumer?) could potentially have a say in uniquely identifying/colouring the coins from "their" devices. But these devices are going to be doing a sort of pooled mining anyway.. so who runs the pool (21) or is allowed to configure the mining to point to a pool? For that matter... who ultimately is allowed to run some code to spend some toaster bitcoin (silicon vendor/OEM/21/consumer/third parties like Trustonic model)?

For embedded I guess it's not a bad thing to have a company with a turn key BTC secure coprocessor chip product to offer. The existing offerings are complex (cortex a w/ trustzone with a trustonic-like sw stack/capabilities, dedicated "secure" coprocessor with OEM defined interfaces..) and a pain to support widely.
Just not sure how 21 will pull it off. 
Of course the real value is the sw and all the cool stuff enabled with devices with this feature widely deployed. Goes without saying. So how does 21 tap that value?
What are the odds that the consumer doesn't actually own the private keys (I.e. the chip and sw running on it)? I'm thinking very high. 21 will offer a service/value/interface to BTC on device.

mining is a pretty simple, rational economic choice. either the vendors get it right or consumers will choose different devices/SW. I'm not really worried about the mining other than this being the real strategy of 21 (hopefully mining is just the trojan horse to appeal to silicon vendors wanting some differentiation to their SoCs, while giving 21 wide access to all the coprocessors, which then expands their business strategies and usefulness of the coprocessor and then network effect)

yes, but currently a handful of individuals are having the majority of the vote. in Bitcoin, the PoW used makes this "specialized" computer actually meaning "expensive" computer. people with the vote are actually just the folks who want to take the risk and spend the most money and make some effort around logistics. very capitalistic.
the Bitcoin nodes are really the only democratic piece of the puzzle and there is not such a huge incentive to run one. also, miners should have enough capability to overcome only being compatible with a small minority of nodes. there is also the users/companies/developers to consider, they have some power over miners but to do anything singular, they must have a sort of super majority.

Sure. I was supposing a different PoW. I tied it up with this statement:


to wrap up my thoughts on that matter.
I think the human factor is big, else you need a great new radical solution to this automated solution to Byzantine Generals. Otherwise, if we acknowledge it's all based on capital, there are probably less wasteful, better scaling ways of implementing the solution (proof of burn? proof of stake?) 
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:07:37


I don't think that would be likely with how Bitcoin mining works today (being based on capital costs = retail $ for chip + cost of electricity and networking. Also consider the opportunity cost.)
Or rather, if the owner/user has the choice, they would choose to opt out of having a mining chip. The mining chip will end up costing more money than you can ever earn back. Though, who's to say consumer choice will win the day? Maybe it will be forced upon us and it will make sense to let the thing earn a few pennies while you sleep.
There is some small extra incentive to have a miner or network of miners you trust, but honestly I forget. When 21.co was announced I recognized it (not public) but thought it was a very small incentive indeed (and not enough of a factor to build a business around). It really bothers me I can't recall now.
Embedded mining makes more sense if you don't need PoW. If somehow 21.co is gangbusters with QCOM, they could introduce a proposal for Bitcoin to remove the PoW and instead use their "trusted computing" core which would really only consume resources for the TX/RX and a block-sized mempool.

6 months is a lot of wasted capital from the previous PoW. 6 months later investors may not want to take that risk again. This PR would be a sort of game theory move by the users/nodes against, in effect, the miners. Maybe the effect is less of an exponential growth of mining power for the new PoW?
In general though, regarding changing PoW, I previously thought the only way it changes is if some radically better one emerges (either somehow democratic or alternatively unpredictably capitalistic, like some complex agreement of what PoW to use at certain blocks, bleh). Though maybe you could envision a world where everyone has a single allocated piece of HW/SW that does mining? That is personally what I've been waiting for a government or huge company to do..

I've heard it's because increasing it without much analysis is just kicking the can down the road and another hard fork might be needed in the future. Analysis is likely impossible to accurately predict an ideal blocksize into the future.
Additionally, miners need some trusted knowledge of what _the_ blocksize _is_, else they may lose money mining a block that is too big for important nodes or that some important node may fork the blockchain (mandating small blocks). This trust so far comes from Bitcoin Core's consensus constants (though it would surprise me if miners don't have a back-channel w/ important businesses and projects).
Otherwise we could do like what I've been doing for years and running with a custom blocksize limit (&gt;1MB).
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:02:17
If the PoW of Bitcoin was some ideal, magical thing that meant ASICs, FPGAs, general purpose computers all had an order of magnitude of the same vote per capital expenditure, I think there is no question Bitcoin would adopt it. In such a scenario it is still true the party that spends the most money/effort gets the most reward, but it would be a sort of linear ROI instead of currently where all these computers have orders of magnitude differences in capability.
This means that although the individuals that spend the most money/effort will reap some extra efficiency gains, the person mining in the basement with a Pentium III still operates at close to 0 profit as opposed to hugely negative profit. The mining will of course still follow lowest cost, which I assume would mean free electricity/bandwidth/low power, cheap computers/low latency.
(Which by the way, is a possible argument for large blocks... add the cost of the network bandwidth into the equation more. I don't know why the Chinese miners are getting such preferential treatment. If they start to orphan blocks and become unprofitable, mining of course will become more distributed. Though of course big blocks are still favoring larger miners.. just not where the internet sucks)
Such a PoW doesn't exist AFAIK. I don't think one ever will (though you could get some marginal gains at least.. instead of a compute heavy PoW you add in other pieces that are common in general purpose PCs like memory, networking, human interaction e.g. solving CAPTCHAs)
Some non-PoW voting schemes are possible but you inevitably need some "trusted computing" (21co could have a business case here. Or you want some open source application like Bitcoin -PoW that runs in Trusted Execution Environments)  xor fiat (like mining and signing with a passport).
I think in the original whitepaper there is a lot of emphasis on decentralization of mining. It remains to be seen if the current Bitcoin will continue to survive the effective centralization of mining. And of course if mining becomes so centralized, it begs the question of what is the real practical point of a PoW like in Bitcoin? Is it not enough to have nodes, users, software that just enforce certain rules on the "miners?"

realistically, if you generated them while offline and power cycled after, you are 99.999999999999% good.
the only realistic threats:
1. the application you used takes advantage of the security HW (very unlikely as this is all new stuff and not very open yet, like maybe Symantec has an app for it) of running a Trusted Application and it keeps some persistent data around after power cycle
2. there is some persistent data which is/was utilized in key generation (entropy? some key used for derivation of other keys?) which is not sufficiently random (this would be horrible design and also not likely but good for conspiracy FUD)
3. there was already some badware capable of running a Trusted Application on your device while booting offline (see

I guess the capital commitment for making ASICs for Bitcoin is getting all the folks here excited..
I would much prefer someone to show a breakthrough proof-of-something (probably it will be a new PoW) scheme that comes closer to reducing necessity of capital to cast a vote. Satoshi chose "one-CPU-one-vote" instead of "one-IP-address-one-vote" due to this reason (or maybe bootstrapping.. was the main concern then) so it makes sense if you can keep on that path of democratizing voting. Though ultimately it all comes down to capital I guess?
And remember, Bitcoin/PoW is necessary because we don't trust anyone. People have been chasing for years "trusted computing" which if properly, widely distributed, would be awesome and solve the double spending problem. TC is getting a lot more interest thanks to Bitcoin for other reasons (e.g. remote attestation used for allowing 0-conf transactions) so it would be ironic if in the future TC is distributed enough to get rid of the original purpose of Bitcoin!

TrustZone is an ARM architecture detail (it is like the lowest level of protection ring, baked in such that it provides a separate view of MMU and for different SoCs an access controlled interface to hardware peripherals and physical memory). Sorry, it's not clear from reading your comments that you know this, for me.
Are you talking about a dedicated AOSP device (with network access disabled)? Obviously that would be more secure as a Bitcoin wallet but it limits it's usefulness, hugely. I don't think ledger folks are claiming to be as secure as a hardware wallet? They are claiming to be way better than any Android wallet. 
The way I see it, you either have on-device security or remote security (cloud or airgap device). The trustlet approach is a hybrid (it is on-device but from the perspective of the Android OS it is a remote device).
By the way, did you know [remote attestation]( is possible with this tech stack?

Yes.. the third party is the attested environment, your device. See Secure Enclave, Trusted Execution Environments, secure elements, TPMs, HSMs, etc. There should be no way to learn S2 from the attested environment.
You can inject a single, common secret key at manufacturing without _anyone_ knowing it except the attested environments (the one having it injected, and perhaps the one injecting). This secret should be access controlled to any attested SW as well, like a wallet.
Multisig is great and I'm glad it's baked in to Bitcoin, but don't think it relates to what we've been talking about (how attestation helps feature enhance some things like reducing risk of double spending for 0-conf transactions or offline spending by means of transferring private key).
This is a trivial scheme because there are expensive resources available today to read what's happening at the transistor level (and maybe there is a less expensive vulnerability found any way), and one vulnerability would ruin the whole thing. In fact, I would probably not suggest this scheme at all (the only similar scheme I'm aware of that makes good sense is secret device specific keys injected at manufacture time which gives the attested environment something to anchor any encrypted info to per-device. Though, conceivably a large customer of an OEM or Silicon Provider could request their own additional secret key there as well. Or maybe they have access controlled virgin e-fuses to allow any customer to do it.).
You either need less trivial schemes or ensure you are limiting the risk of a vulnerability found by mitigating what your wallet software allows for (shopping: Instant OK, buying a car: defer to blockchain). But it gets the point across that it is possible.


I didn't reduce the problem at all since it's the basis of what we've been talking about. The assumption is the secret doesn't become known.

Well, as a trivial counter example, one optional recovery scheme could limit the recovery of the encrypted backup to similarly attested devices. The user knows secret recovery information S1 and all similarly attested devices know secret S2. Could make it impossible to recover PK in any non-attested environment.

The assumption is that the private key is effectively only known to the truslet/tee/device (and the user must authenticate to control any signing etc). If the user chooses to view the key, the SW knows this and can no longer guarantee assurance of no double spend unless the coins are moved and settled to a new virgin btc address controlled by attested SW.

@_date: 2015-08-28 06:12:26
Attestation gives you some level of assurance of the remote environment (which could be in someone else's device or your own) which your own trusted software can handle appropriately. Remote attestation and trusted computing are mentioned together frequently because how else can you trust that some device is really doing trusted computing? It's like asking if some random array of bits is random (interestingly, you could imagine an API existing in the attested environment which tells you indeed, this array of bits just generated is a result of a random seed generated thusly and then such and such cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator or stream cipher was used. More information about the HW, integration, vulnerabilities could be known, inferred, or speculated publicly to help SW build any white/black lists).


Err, yes. I said as much:


and cautioned against using some shared symmetric key/secret in a real scheme. But the example proves such a scheme is possible which is much better than the situation we have today of not trusting anything except the blockchain or some TTPs who are less trustworthy or less ubiquitous than HW/SW vendors.

Economic nodes have been the most important factor in the past. Miners are a necessary part right now, until a better method is found that gives better security/decentralization. Meanwhile, being able to change the PoW of the existing system seems like a decent weapon in the arsenal.

@_date: 2015-08-26 23:04:28
I don't have my own scheme, I'll let others who aren't paying me and who are actually in a position to do something with it or make some money do the work. You can google "trusted computing remote attestation" to find papers and more information.
The tech that enables remote attestation is a huge step in device/remote trust. One that could improve some pain points of Bitcoin; at least one example being allowing some subset of transactions to be 0-conf, delaying broadcast if desirable, like if you are in a remote location, or if you want to have something like a secret private key no one knows (except the attested environment) you can very tightly control access to (so now you don't even need any Bitcoin transaction, you are just passing ownership of the secret private key).
It's no doubt hairy and I'm sure there will be implementations which fall on their face.

by the way, ARM introduced trustzone in their architecture to allow both a non-secure and secure processor to co-exist on the single physical processor. It helps eliminate the requirement to go off processor to do your secure processing (TPM, crypto, DRM, secure boot, etc).
It means that the ledger wallets, rivetz wallets, and company should be as secure as a trezor and company against common threat models (like stealing keys).
A lot of smartphones already ship (with secure OS capabilities/features like trusted user input/display) that make them more appealing than a hardware wallet for a lot of users.

Ok, I agree some of this is dumbing down and marketing. I generally agree with their message though (but I also agree with you that, actually, a dedicated hardware wallet with less attack vectors is more secure).
So, for me, this sort of ledger trustlet integrated wallet would become my hot wallet and replace my coinbase hot wallet (well.. turns out if a merchant uses coinbase maybe it's still convenient to let coinbase hold some coin). Whereas before I put almost no faith in the Android wallet solutions unless _maybe_ your running on a Nexus which receives faster updates. Ultimate security is still cold wallets.




Agreed. It has more in common with a TPM or secure element.






Remote attestation is basically defined that you trust the remote code! Or at least, you can model it as a higher level of trust than the alternative, and continue to let confirmations be the ultimate settlement.. By the way, some of the assumptions here also make DRM work effectively.


If one wallet is supporting attestation, it would presumabley be programmed to account for if the other wallet is attested as well. So it means you don't run into the case where it is making the wrong assumptions like you point out. For instance, maybe double spend protection is only possible if the previous transaction also came from an attested device (thus initiating the chain of trust).


(see: 
If we had remote attestation widely working 20, 10 years ago, Bitcoin would not have been invented ;)
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:41:10




a secure device would authenticate all software that is executable and any input from the non-secure device read by the secure device should be also checked as much as possible. Likewise, you can mitigate side-channels but that's a bit different threat model.

in the beginning, miners were nodes were wallets were users were developers, especially considering software client you would run.
since then, the overlap has diminished. asic miners can still be nodes but practically it doesn't make sense to bake in all the node logic into hardware, so the asic miners will communicate with trusted (or miner-owned) nodes.
ultimately, any software just needs to follow specific, valid rules to do interesting things with Bitcoin. you don't need to run the reference client, much like bittorrent, email, etc.

nope... classic will follow same chain as core unless a minority (big block) miner decides to burn capital by making big blocks that won't last based on hash power. in which case classic nodes should wait for more confirmations to consider btc settled. also, miners will not upgrade block size until enough economic nodes upgrade block size. thus classic will stay on the same chain as core.
it's not like classic is  _lowering_  max block size, which would be the disaster you allude to.
maybe there is an argument on the idea that once we increase to 2MB there is no realisticly going back, so better have a good reason to increase.
the impetus is on core to explain why any block size &gt;1MB (or some distribution of theoretical sizes) is so incredibly horrible for Bitcoin as we know it. otherwise a node can pretty much choose any max block size&gt;1MB and be fine (versus outmoded 0.12 core nodes in a hypothetical big block future). they have mostly not made it clear why it's a bad thing. even direct questions are avoided by them.
I'm pretty annoyed all the talk is about the evil of a hard fork when that is completely not the point and not worth discussing. what should be discussed is the actual technical purpose of a given max block size limit.

At this point, the owner of a car could pass the ownership token of the car to the car itself given sufficient HW/SW system capabilities in the car.
This is a pretty workable implementation that gets "self-ownership" (the how). 
[1] of course there is still the court system and governments who may have a different opinion of things. There are sure to be many cases in the future regarding ownership of smart/autonomous property.

OK. Then I would certainly warn against naming this "atomic" since it's possibly equivalent to saying 1) begin atomic swap A with B 2) after some time, B is in both slots and the operation is now almost surely complete.
It could still be a handy transaction scheme, but it's not atomic.
@_date: 2016-09-29 04:18:01
What about:


emphasis added. Wording makes it sound like it's simple for Barbie to spend chain B while still having some "possession" of the chain A tokens (once the 48 hours elapses). Basically if Ken goes awol for a few days Barbie gets both tokens.
Can someone point out my misunderstanding? Maybe it would be simpler to look at the actual logic, transactions than the english and Ken/Barbie chat?
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:35:07
However, I thought it was pointed out previously (not just by me?) that it's not really atomic, since e.g. if Alice knows Bob will be MIA during the swap period (he does not spend the new output), she can issue a refund transaction and end up with both tokens. Not sure if a better name/description has been proposed..

OK.. I'm sure the business model is like for ATMs..
But imagine a model where the machine (or providers of machine) is also somehow tied into the POS to accept BTC payments. Thus the merchant could then accept BTC payments then turn around and sell those BTC form their machine for more margin. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:27:36
OK, so instead of state enforcement, would you agree with a technical solution?
See DRM/Trusted Computing.
I'm personally somewhat OK with DRM so long as there is a physical enable/disable at the bootloader stage. Though I'm not sure there won't be shitty side effects like "to use this app you must boot into official chain of trust Windows" which you can see with a heck of a lot of software or similarly Android apps with bloated app permissions. Or see the recent ECU code scandal for VW. The end product is more valuable than giving up some freedoms..
@_date: 2015-09-07 04:51:52
not sure why you are getting downvoted. (actually it's probably people that think truthcoin is an alt?)
@_date: 2015-10-16 21:10:22
Disagree with a lot of that but do agree that people are upset that it's not clear who really owns what, e.g. car's firmware, digital media from amazon/steam, etc. I see this as an unclear legal issue, not a knock on DRM.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:14:58
Link to read more about it? I didn't think payment channels were great since they lock up BTC for some time to a specific channel and you still have to pay fees to go in/out of a channel... but maybe LN is better, i.e. one LN channel means you can spend coins at any LN merchant?
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:13:13

@_date: 2016-05-11 22:54:32
Oh, then I guess the second point is not clear to me. Can you clarify?
Geography deals with energy source (e.g. coal vs solar), cost of energy, cost of acquiring ASICs, and many more (legal system as we are now talking about) inputs to the cost analysis of mining profitability. Things that ultimately do play a factor in the degree of mining centralization.
@_date: 2016-05-11 23:49:14
so is it a high probability that a license would be granted to the current large miners (free for all or flat fee license is dumb unless it was just for academic purposes and to get names on a patent)?
in the mail thread Hilliard suggests it is exclusive to Bitmain. Would Bitmain refuse to license to domestic competitors but be okay with selling to international players with less of an advantage as he? Or is it likely that it will be kept by the single player? Again, it could open the door in geographies that do not enforce this sort of patent.
What would core/blockstream do if they come up with something like AsicBoost? Deploy it as a weapon against centralization by patenting it and license it only to the small players?
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:32:52
yep. even Galaxy Nexus (omap4) had some crypto HW you could use to mine more efficiently than the CPU (so long as you could load/authenticate the code). but it was easy to see the writing on the wall even back then that you need (lots of) ASICs and cheap electricity to make mining worthwhile.
Does anyone know the latest in new mining algos (to reduce energy usage) which is practically IO bound (and anyway is IO bound provably better for the environment, less of a waste, desired)? I remember a thread from last year when people considered something like ROMix but dismissed it because it is difficult to verify (if you don't have the full blockchain). But have people though of incorporating the nodes/network into mining? Meaning miners query nodes for some signed secret to incorporate into the hash (like a large, additional nonce)? Hard to find the right secret you need but easy for other miners/nodes to verify it?
That way the IO bound is really the speed that the partially non-deterministic information could be retrieved (long distance with the speed of light limit) and it's random if the information works for the miner or not. The nodes would be half of the mining. This could also be a nice way to incentivize running a full node, by the way.
Or maybe to prevent cheating/collusion you have to design to a whole new mining scheme where there are red miners, blue miners, yellow miners.. and they are all used to mine the next block. Not sure if this is a new way to solve byzantine generals or just extending proof of work.
All in all, crypto currencies really do incentivize cool developments (cheaper/efficient energy, faster networks, computer hardening/security)!

dang.. thought this would be a post about how "there are lots of people like me" that disagree with both centralized miners and Bitcoin Core. And that the failure to activate SegWit will probably mean more relative value going into alt-coins that can scale (and the diversification itself is a bit of scaling).
I would prefer BTC to dominate while also taking in innovative features etc, but if I have to shift some value into a more capable coin, I have no problem doing so (except for the hassle of running so many different nodes!).

Sometimes I miss the golden age of Bitcoin. It was Mike Hearn, Hal Finney, and Satoshi that really sold the vision of Bitcoin, for me.

did you overclock or disable your automatic fan? if not, then your card was faulty and you can RMA it no problem.
if so, then yeah, it goes without saying that stressing the GPU 100% 24/7 will have it working at and beyond its limits. be careful; find your safe limits before running it non-stop.
if you can't RMA it, maybe look into doing some weird stuff like freezing it or warming it up in an oven (to reflow any tiny cracks or something.. but maybe that only works for xbox360s) or try re-seating the heatsink or under-clocking.

I have been wondering about this a lot too. How it will really look in the future.
There are only a few guys making ASICs now, it would be amazing to see a large company jump into the fray by offering some "bitcoin mining" chips and/or boards or PCI-E cards purposefully built for Bitcoin. Not to freaking mention if some ARM SoC vendors throw on a Bitcoin block and distribute the whole thing (actually.. need to do more research, many of these mobile SoCs already have crypto blocks, how viable are they to mine?)
And they could be offsetting their engineering costs the whole time by mining some while testing the prototypes :)
I wonder who will be first?

Or maybe they are more likely to say: "I'd like to send 367 Dirham worth of bitcoin to Dubai, please."
Point being, currency is all relative.
Bitcoins are a global, distributed currency. I think the idea is to get widespread adoption and get the power of printing (de facto) money out of the hand of central authorities. With widespread adoption, goods/services will be priced in denominations of BTC.

Depends on the merchant and it's tolerance to BTC exposure. Pretty sure bitpay/coinbase offer a "sliding %" of value to keep in BTC or cash out to $$$.
The bitcoin economy needs this intermediate step to grow. Eventually, enough people will accept BTC as a payment method that there will be less and less incentive to need to cash out to cover the businesses costs or to reduce exchange rate risk.
For example, if a coffee shop takes bitcoins, the owner is more likely to hold bitcoins if the coffee roaster supplier also takes bitcoins and the coffee roaster is more likely to hold bitcoins if the coffee bean farmer accepts bitcoins. The coffee bean farmer may prefer bitcoins as payment since it reduces the need for dealing with international banking and bitcoins are generally more appealing to countries not pegged to a relatively stable currency like the USD.
