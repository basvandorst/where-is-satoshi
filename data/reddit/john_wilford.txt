But that does not change the fact that people have no right to limit the gold supply to put it another way if SpaceX mines gold from an asteroid is it theft? I'm also not sure what the cost has to do with it if theft is really cheap is it suddenly not theft? If I steal $1 from you but it cost me $2 to do it is it ok by some dollar amount virtue? My point is that printing paper is not theft or inherently wrong. Us continuing to use it is stupid and them forcing us to use it at gunpoint is the issue. It was no less theft when they started issuing gold certificates at gun point, changed it to silver certificates at gun point, or any other time a government has forced a currency on it's people. Get them to stop forcing FRNs on us at gun point and I promise you will not need any laws against printing, it will simply stop.

As a staunch Libertarian I have to respectfully disagree with you. FIAT is not theft any more than mining more gold is stealing from those who already own gold or manufacturing diamonds is stealing from diamond miners. I will have to say that using FIAT is stupidity perpetuated by government violence, a lack of economic education, and convenience. I will also say that the acts of violence that have enforced the FIAT system such as the seizure of gold or the requirement that it can settle all debts public and private is theft and assault. People have no right to keep the government from printing money only the right to stop taking it. Give unto Cesar what is Cesar's and buy Bitcoin. Long live freedom!

I'm not going to down vote you because while I don't agree with you I also don't think this is a "bad post" just a difference of opinion. That said they are using another companies fame and the fact that they have a better "product" to propel themselves forward. This is not a new tactic companies have been using it for years by making little digs at each other. I don't think it is wrong it is just business just like when WU had the post taken down it was just business. Business is not about being nice it's about making money.

They are hating on them because it generates hype and gets them more up votes. As far as the circle jerk boat don't get me started. I love the idea of decentralized currencies but Bitcoin has real problems and they are coming to a head faster than people realize. Don't try telling anyone in the community that least the Bitcoin Inquisition finds you and declares you are not a true believer.

On second thought this might not quiet work for my needs (credit cards understandably not accepted) but I am excited to see that someone is thinking ahead.

Control is not necessary and is the fallacy of the whole system. To say that it is necessary to control the system is to say that those controlling the participants in the system are some how made of a finer clay and know better what should happen than the owners of that money. That said you are right that inflation is not theft but gold seizures as well as legal requirements that FRNs can settle all debts public and private is both theft and assault. If you controlling how I spend my money is such a good idea let me go out and fuck off my life then come crawling back when I learn my lesson. I don't think it is such a good idea and that is why it has to be enforced with a gun. This idea of control has gotten so crazy that now FRNs are being deemed as "to free" for a healthy economy. Many countries are attempting to drive the interest rate below zero because world debt has reached a critical mass where it is now worth it to save at a near 0% interest rate and to prevent a run on the banks some economists are recommending removing hard currencies for digital ones to keep people from burring their money in a jar in the back yard. Look at the bright side though, banks may now be less useful than a mason jar, but at least we don't have deflation.

That actually does. If nothing else it confirms some of my earlier inclinations. Thanks for the reply.

The best part of this article is "There is already a movement afoot to make Austin, Texas a Bitcoin mecca" I may be moving :D

Show here the serial number on a dollar. Explain to her that a dollar is really just a fancy way of printing that serial code on a piece of paper so the debt can be verified. Then ask her if she remembers writing letters before email digitized it. Now explain to her that BitCoin is just a way to track the serial numbers through the internet, like emails were a way to track letters through the internet. This is a convoluted and not entirely accurate representation of BitCoin but it will get her thinking about it without having to explain cryptography.
