Please donate to MAPS - the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]( They are conducting groundbreaking research with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is proving to be more effective than all existing treatments.
MDMA is scheduled to become prescription medicine by 2021, and psychedelic therapy more broadly is one of the most promising areas in current scientific and medical research. MAPS is the main organization spearheading the research and conducting clinical trials to get through the FDA approval process is extremely expensive.
In the longer term, psychedelic research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ailments like depression, anxiety and addiction, and replace the pharmaceutical industry with more affordable and effective options.
