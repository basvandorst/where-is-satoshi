Coinbase to GDAX to wallet and you won’t get hit with any fees.

By the end of 2018, maybe. No way it hits 50k by the end of this year.

I’m not a proponent of negative interest rates (even though I agree it would primarily target the ultra wealthy corporations).  I’ve seen first hand billions of dollars wasted via injection of federal funds into the “private” sector and can only assume we would see negative interest rates spurn the same kind of wasteful/reckless spending on a much larger scale.
You are spot on in that this is simply one of many academic studies and in no way indicates this well become policy.  How this could effect bitcoins purchasing power is anybody’s guess.

Last I checked rich, poor, and in between need food and shelter.  And what poor people have savings to begin with, savings rate for even the middle class is dismal.

I’m not advocating a short, but this is just naive. What makes you buying low and selling high different from  someone shorting high and buying back low?

I get the HODL approach, but feel like the type of user Coinstar is targeting are those less technically inclined. For your average person it's still too complicated to transact with BTC so the store of value approach seems more likely. And how many average people are going to tie up investment dollars in a Coinstar machine that to move back to fiat requires jumping through a bunch of hurdles?
More purchase options/methods is certainly not a bad thing, but I don't personally see Coinstar as suddenly driving up adoption (as seems to be being implied in this subreddit these last few days).

I keep seeing all these posts about Coinstar, but can you cash out via one of their machines? Or only purchase?
KYC issues aside I don’t foresee this being that popular without a way to liquidate. It seems as though you still need an exchange account for liquidation so might as well just set that up in the beginning and lower your purchase commission.

It's still too complicated for the average person to spend. Maybe in time. Those of us here are not in the "average" person category (at least not when it comes to this). 
Buy and hold sure, but the fact that there is no easy way to convert it in my eyes limits how many people will actually use Coinstar to accumulate.  How many people invest in an asset that they have no idea how to liquidate when/should the need arise?
As I stated below:  "More purchase options/methods is certainly not a bad thing, but I don't personally see Coinstar as suddenly driving up adoption (as seems to be being implied in this subreddit these last few days). "

I’ve been seeing these posts over the last few days and wondered what exactly this was about. Nice to see it explained.
