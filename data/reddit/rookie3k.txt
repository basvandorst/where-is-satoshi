I read that Atomic Swaps are gonna be a reality in the coming months. I would think that this news should boost the price of both BTC and LTC. So why are the biggest gains over the last couple weeks coming from ETH?

No idea. Like I said, I just started working there a few months ago.

So... I just started working at Fidelity, and last week I met with a couple guys who were looking to recruit some people internally to the crypto team. I had a good conversation with them. So I hope I can get an interview for the team.

Tell them you will cash out the 2k after the weekend. Delay as long as you can. With the way the price is moving, every day you delay is worth a lot.

I don't know why everyone is freaking out about this "crash". two days ago we were sitting around $12k-13k. Then yesterday the price spiked and was all over the place, and today it has settled down. But the price stabilized  a good $2k-$3k higher than it was just a couple days ago. I dare you to keep your coin off-line so you arent tempted to make a rash decision, and then not check the price for a week. Come back next Friday and you will see people freaking out about the massive crash from $26k down to $23k, and you will be glad you saved money on heartburn medication.

Yeah, I have read about Roger Ver, and I know he has a big stake in Bcash and will do whatever he can to see it succeed, including flipping everyone off when they call it Bcash. But my concerns about the lightning network are still there. Maybe I should have titled this post differently.

The only thing I can think of when I see the charts like the ones on coinmarketcap is this one time when bitcoin went all the way to $1100,  and then it CRAAASHED all the way to $239. So the moral of the story is, don't buy bitcoin. Cuz you know its gonna crash again. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:54
And then this other time, Bitcoin was all the way up to $18,000... and then it CRASHED. All the way down to $16,500. So the moral of the story is, don't buy bitcoin. Because you know its gonna crash again.

Anytime the topic of bitcoin is brought up, someone always asks me how much bitcoin I own. They want to know how much I am investing before they dip their toes in the water themselves. The correct answer to the question is always “not enough. “

“The government” isn’t going to completely overhaul global money through anonymous means. They would endlessly debate it, and then turn it into a partisan issue to distract from whatever scandal/war they have going on at the time. Plus, I’ve known government employees. They are lazy as hell, and they don’t innovate. They steal ideas from other people.

Bitcoin is the original. It is the most traded, and has the name behind it. Kind of like Kleenex and Q-Tip, the name is already basically the generic name for cryptocurrency, and everyone else is just followers.
In addition, if there were to be a better coin that emerges in the coming years, they will probably hard fork off of Bitcoin. So you should buy Bitcoin and hold on to it anyway.

...Not at this rate. We just dropped below my DCA, which makes me sad. But this just ensures that I really will be in this for the long term HODL strategy.

I’m gonna take a shot in the dark and guess he bought during the massive spike in 2017, hoping for some quick gains, only to hold as he saw it spike to 20k, then continued to hold as he watched it plummet past his buyin point. And now he is pissed because he lost money. 
If you can’t handle the swings, don’t invest what you can’t tolerate to lose. And you should plan to hold for years, not weeks. It’s nearly impossible to time the bitcoin market for day trading if you don’t know what you are doing.
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:12:17
I really wish this were true. At one time I honestly thought we would never see prices under $10k, yet here we are. I'm HODLing long term, so I've got my fingers crossed.

Keeping your coin in a hardware wallet or paper wallet, kept in a safe place, also makes it less likely that you will panic and do something you regret. I watched all the ups and downs today from my desk at work, and I don't keep my Trezor with me. I didn't have the ability to panic sell if I wanted to. This is the best way to practice long term HODLing. Money kept on an exchange makes it much more tempting to try day trading, which is never a good idea in a crazy market like this if you don't know what you  are doing.

From what I have gathered, Howard mentions he has seen the price go to $5k, and then Lenard says that he remembers mining some coins a few years ago, so they all go try to find their coins but they are gone, and only Sheldon knows what happened to them. They all get excited at the prospects of having a ton of money, but to no avail. Turns out that Penny's old dumb boyfriend has them, and now he is rich. Cue laugh track, roll credits. 
It might be the turning point for some people to actually go online and try investing. But then they will see that coins are $10k and not $5k, so they wont buy any because they dont have that kind of money laying around to buy a coin. 
Doesn't matter though. $12k by Christmas guaranteed, or Penny will have to eat Sheldon's left nut.

Probably whatever the exchange rate to USD was at the time. Seems like a good idea for the dealership, because by next month the value of those coins will be worth 30% more than they are now.

The majority of people don’t have 8 grand for an initial investment. Buy what you can afford and HODL on to it. Then when you get your next pay check buy a little more.

So.... that’s a new prediction I haven’t heard yet. Coins are almost $10k now. Doubling 11 times in the next year and a half would make each coin with $20.480.000. I guess I’ll have to eat my right ball if that happens. Isn’t that how this works? Am I doing it right?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:28:45
Yes it’s normal. But you are locked in at the price when you bought. So it doesn’t matter if you are gonna be hodling. If you are planning on quick trading, you will want to deposit your funds and then do your buying.

We know that Reddit is known for hugging websites to death, just wonder what would happen to the price of btc If everyone who read this post decided to buy some coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:12:05
My thoughts on this crash:
1) BTC is definitely crashing, but so are the rest of the major crypto players. The whole market seems to be down. It remains to be seen which cryptos will survive this crash and pull through. 
2) The market downswing also means that bcash is down too. This makes me happy.

You have a couple choices: First, you can deposit funds into your account, wait a week for it to clear, move the money to gdax, and then start trading without fees. Or, you can purchase right now at the current price + markup + fees, and then wait a week for the transaction to clear. I personally will just pay the fees, and figure it into my dollar cost average. The price moves so much, that by the time my cash deposit clears and I make a purchase, the price will have gone up $1000+. Even with the fees, it is in my best interest to just buy it now while the price is low.
