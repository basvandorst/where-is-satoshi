I have only stated the facts as they are.
I apologize if you feel that I unfairly accused you of anything. I'm just saying ...and I will say it again I didn't do anything wrong.

That all went down on a tax return that was just filed for this last season. And we also paid all the taxes to the DMV for purchasing the car in California. So yes we pay our taxes a hell of a lot of taxes.

This is one tough crowd.
All I meant by we... is the money belongs to my wife and I,  it's not just mine. Of course it is an individual account. There is no sharing of account going on. Absolutely nothing strange or weird like that. I'm telling you the God's honest truth I am absolutely legit. I do not screw around when it comes to this type of stuff.
I've heard of too many people's accounts being closed for doing stuff that is wrong. I've never been stupid enough to engage in any of that type of activity. I don't gamble or buy stuff off of drug sites or anything like that. It's always been just straight-up business.
We as in family. Not as in doing anything wrong.

I can't believe it took so long for you guys to get back to me to do this. I have lost so much money in the last 4 days by not being able to reinvest this 30000 into a different exchange house.
I am trying to transfer the funds now out of the Coinbase site.  But every time i try it does not send me the 2 step code to my Authy app.
I have never had any issues with coinbase and the authy app before. It has always worked perfectly. Somehow it must have gotten turned off for my account. Because you begin the process of shutting down my account somehow it is now disconnected.
I cannot get the code. So I cannot transfer the funds.
Please help me with this issue.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:42:37
No code, no transfer =(
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:41:44
The funds are showing up on the coinbase site now but when I try to withdraw it ask for the 2-step verification code provided by authy.
But it does not send the code to my phone.

I think people can understand that we only means.....
 we make decisions together.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:52:04
I really appreciate your advice and any help that anyone can give but please don't try to make something out of nothing.
I only meant we decided this and we decided that. If you are married and straight with the one that you love you will understand.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:16:36
The thing is this. 
If they have some legitimate reason for doing what they've done then just tell me.
The big problem is they do not communicate.
This whole thing could be some easy to solve misunderstanding. But coinbase does not communicate with its customers.
$30,000 is a lot of money and a lot of stress.
I know they're big and they have a lot of assets but you just can't treat customers this way.
I can't imagine any other business or bank doing this type of thing to customers and hoping to survive.

I have to say there is nothing that feels better that deleting Coinshits app off your phone. =)
I have spoken with a ton of anti Coinshit peeps since this all started and this is what they had to say...
If you make a lot of profit on Coinshit and dont hold it. If you make too many withdraws... you will get the boot.
I have read through the whole thing and im pretty sure that is not a violation of Coinshits TOS.
Just a little FYI.
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:56:24
Yeah who knows? Could be that person gave me an address straight to his account on a gambling site or drug site? Who Knows! Its just a BTC address. There is no way you could know if its good or bad. Right?
But Coinshit will not ask you about it. I know who sold it to me. I have the person's info. I have the guitar. I have all the proof of the 
BTC transaction from me to this persons account. I did nothing wrong!
But.....Even after being with them 5 years and hundreds of transactions... they will just straight close your account with no explanation and no warning and keep your assets locked up for a week with ZERO communication.
I really like POLONIEX. I use them also.
I could have transferred the assets the day Coinshit closed my account. I could have been in when ETH Jumped from $53 to $80.  Coinshit cost me $17,000.  The 30K is now supposed to be 47K. Pretty expensive $300 Fender Squire bass i guess.
But... instead im still waiting for the 30k to get to my bank. =(.  Coinshit sucks so bad.
DO NOT TRUST COINBASE!!

I am trying and trying but it will not send me the code?
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:09:11
Please don't think I'm rude when I give you this reply because I'm just very frustrated. I'm trying not to be emotional but these are the facts.
Of course I understand that gdax is coinbase. I have been with them since they began. And with others before they came along.
I am an educated experienced long-term cryptocurrency investor. And no of course I did not open an account with coinbase with anything fake. I am absolutely 100% legit.
And I have never done anything illegal concerning coinbase and their terms of service.
They have every piece of my legit information including my driver's license copy. I had a ten thousand dollars a day add or withdrawal limit.
I cannot move my funds out of gdax  because whenever I try to log into gdax it just kicks me over to the coinbase area where it says account closed please move your assets out of coinbase.  But the problem is the gdax assets were not transferred over to the coinbase area before they without any warning closed the account so they do not show up.
I cannot believe this is happening, obviously I really trusted coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:13:27
I wouldn't trust coinbase with a dime
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:35:07
I honestly can't think of anything we could have done wrong? Swear to God.
The only thing we did recently was take 25k out of coinbase to buy a vehicle. Our other one died.
But I just can't imagine that could be seen as doing something wrong. They set the withdrawal limits.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:25:37
I am in central California on the coast not far from San Francisco where they supposedly are but who knows really?
And the kicker is this the only reason it was in USD in GDAX is because I did a little trading and made a little bit of gains. I was logging back in to buy back in on ETH at $53. Found out they had closed my account and then it went up to over $80. In just a matter of a few days. So anyway anyone can do the math with 30 thousand that would have been invested and see how much I lost within a week. Over and above the 30. Somewhere between 15 to 20 thousand. I'm honestly sick I feel like I'm going to throw up. That is our savings account and it feels like it's gone.
As far as trying to transfer funds I've tried everything. It's just not happening. They've got my money and I have no idea if I'm going to ever get it back or not. They will not contact me.
For the rest of my life I will do everything in my power to try and keep people away from coinbase. At all cost. 
They could have just done the right thing and allow me to just move it out.  Then I could have just reinvested it to a different exchange house.
But they are just holding it and holding it and holding it with zero communication.
I'm telling you people this can happen to you. and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:35:57
There's only one thing you can do keep making noise publicly. Let everyone know what coinbase is doing publicly. Say it loud and don't let up. That is the only thing Coinbase will respond to.
They are completely hidden and they feel and act like they are above the law. And they don't care one bit about common courtesy or customer courtesy.
They have so much business they really don't care about doing the right thing.
They think they are too big to fail.
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:26:20
Well thanks Rosie.
Thanks for closing my account after I've been doing business with your company for over 4 years with no warning and no reason. You guys have made so much money off of me. 
And all of my friends that I talked into joining your company.
And Thanks for sitting on my 30k while ETH WENT UP FROM $53 TO $80.
I still cannot transfer the funds to my bank.
Everytime i try it will not send the code to my Authy app.
No code = No transfer.
I have never had a problem with authy before?
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:06:29
I understand that you feel I must have done something wrong. 
And you're just trying to figure out what it is?  I am telling you straight up that is not the case in this situation.
If anyone out there thinks Coinbase can't just shut down your account for no reason...
You better think again. 
Don't be stupid like me, protect your assets.
@_date: 2017-05-03 00:35:17
And i gotta say...
Thanks to the reddit ahole troll hisatoshi who just wanted to kick me while im down. This guy is all class.
By the way mr know it all. You're the only ahole here that's mental.
 if i really had done anything wrong with the IRS or whatever they don't have to release my funds. With a court order they can keep them. But they did release them. Why??? because i didn't do anything wrong. Just like i said.  But only after a week and only after i exposed their shitty  business practice to the world would they respond. After holding 30K for a week. In direct violation of their own TOS. Imagine how many millions they make off the interest of holding USD that belongs to the customers instead of releasing it when they should by law.
The lesson for today is... if you're being bent over by Coinshit. Be sure and LET EVERYONE KNOW. asap.
otherwise you may never get a response. Much less your assets that they owe you.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:19:00
No I'm not mental.
And I apologize if I hurt your feelings. I did not mean to. I'm just in a very tough situation right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:39:39
The only other transaction we've made in a while was I got a guitar on Craigslist from a guy who took Bitcoin. So I transferred some eth to bitcoin and paid him $300 in Bitcoin for a bass.
But that was just a transfer directly from my GDAX account to his BTC account.
Do you think they could take that small transaction as doing something wrong??
Wrong enough to close my account after around 5 years of being a loyal customer?
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:13:06
The AHoles waited until it was USD.
I have plenty of coins in other more trustworthy exchanges. Ive been in this since the begining.
 TRUST COINBASE
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:07:56
Supposedly it's in route to my bank.
Butt... I wouldn't trust thwm as far as I could throw them all so who knows?
 TRUST COINBASE!

This is a copy of the last email to Coinbase who finally released my funds. But only because i started this thread and let the world see what Coinbase is really all about.
The final email reads.... 
It acts as if it worked.
But i don't trust your company anymore. At all.
I guess we will see in a few days. if the funds come through to my bank or not.
I don't know why your company did what you did after i made you so much in fees over the years...  but i can assure you it was a mistake. Your algorithm for kicking people out is flawed.
I did nothing wrong. And unless you can prove that i did your company will remain liable for my losses. I will now be using the 30k for attorney fees. great right? I did not break any rules of your TOS but Coinbase did by not releasing my funds when it closed my account. You cost me at least $15k by holding the funds while ETH went from $53 to $80.
I have a new mission in life i will start a blog and document everything that has happened here. And everything that happens with the upcoming lawsuit.
What your company did without any warning whatsoever after i have supported you for so long is just so wrong.
I was always a huge advocate of Coinbase, Now i will be the opposite. I will do everything i can to keep people away from your company.
In short what your company did was just low down bullshit.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:49:41
When you shutdown an account shouldn't anything and everything from GDAX be automatically moved over to Coinbase instantly.
Or at least give the person access to there own GDAX account so they can remove it or move it over??
Not allowing a person to have their funds when you shut down their account is a violation of your terms of service agreement.
You shut down my account because you said I somehow violated your TOS....(which I know that I did not) but aren't you doing the exact same thing by not releasing funds??
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:47:25
Yes them shutting down your coinbase account and not letting you get to your assets in GDAX
Is a direct violation of their terms of service agreement.  Which is especially funny because that's their accusation against you for shutting down your account in the first place.
In my situation I know I personally never violated the TOS. Absolutely and certainly not intentionally.
But coinbase on the other hand does intentionally violate their own TOS. 
Don't trust Coinbase!
You will be next.
