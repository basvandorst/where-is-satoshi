This and I don't know why so many are convinced it's just one individual unless I'm missing something, but even in the abstract of the whitepaper is says:
"WE propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network."
Maybe it's a group.

That's actually really impressive, I know I probably couldn't do that good of a job.

Can't wait until I can get to the point of making larger trades like that! For now I just write down a price where I'd hypothetically buy and sell and dream about it being real.

It's sad seeing how many people still find a way to hate simply because he's targeting an educational video at a specific demographic that is largely out of touch with Cryptocurrency. Even when the adoption of Crypto in the black community will only help it's cause. 
Unfortunate, but it's nothing we've never dealt with before. Keep fighting the good fight BBN!

That's because most of those black people you come across are on YouTube...
