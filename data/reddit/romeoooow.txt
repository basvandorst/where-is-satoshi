Are you the best representation of the Bitcoin Reddit community?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:40:56
I'm really not lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:02:39
Don't have the capital to invest regardless :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:07:31
I appreciate you reaching out. It's nice to have people who understand. Hopefully we'll both be able to rise up to better situations one day.

If you consider it an unhealthy mindset, you have no idea what it's like to be poor. Money will most definitely bring a peace of mind for a while. At least for my parents. How about we start there. The mindset that "you'll still feel the same way" is something I do not believe, because I have never felt like what it is to even be an ounce of well off or financially stable.

They don't gain or lose. That's just how I'm thinking about it. It doesn't make sense that I would offer for them to keep 50% of my earnings or something, because then they might as well keep the whole Bitcoin. It's just more fair if they were to do a favor and break even.

Thanks :/
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:03:34
Tbh, you're probably right
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:40:49
I mean the person would be paid back either way you know?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:54:51
I mean I read all the FAQ on the Bitcoin website
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:50:22
Lol well thanks for the advice I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:57
Explain more please? I have no idea what any of that means
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:39:01
Also I'm sorry I came off that way :(
I just want a Bitcoin bc I'm poor and want to pay off debts and get a car. Long shot dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:47:46
Just a kind favor from a kind soul from one person to another. Looking past the basic mechanics of investing and returns.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:02:15
So true
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:58:15
You're right. I know nothing about the world of investing, but it seems like a wealth of opportunity. And I unfortunately value short term gains over long term wealth, always "trying to treat myself." I want to get out of that mindset, but it is how I was raised- and how my parents are.

That's the point... and the person will be paid back with whatever they originally invested. Breaking even.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:38
Wait so did someone help you out? I want someone to help me out ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:11
Nah, I literally came to this subreddit for the first time 5 mins ago, don't shit on the page 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:04:06
I worked to buy my own phone and computer but ok :/
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:03:03
You're right. I appreciate the insight.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:20:20
What... I offered to pay back in full.

I'm in school right now, but won't be following the path of computer science- have tried it intensely for a year, it's not my thing, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:20
Oh explain more please? Could I invest in half a Bitcoin for $8000 (since it's like 15K now?)
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:47:13
Does anyone have any other reason? 
There's still stuff to do with ones money to help others in need.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:16:15
Lol ok
I'd probs use the one Bitcoin I have to invest in other Bitcoin and I would even give 30% to other people/charities/causes in need
I 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:41:10
I know, hence why it's a long shot :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:48:17
There's a chance :/
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:46:15
This is such a wholesome reply. Thank you. I'm trying my best for a good future :)
