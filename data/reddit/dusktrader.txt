I'm just saying don't knock the US Dollar, because that would be going against the grain. Much easier to convince people to try something new while aligning with something else they already trust.
"Save 20% or more when you convert Pesos-&gt;US Dollars with bitcoin"
"Convert Pesos -&gt; US Dollars legally with bitcoin"
"Send money anywhere for free with bitcoin"
"Bitcoin: a better money with zero inflation"

Welcome to Bitcoin and also Armory! I personally feel you've made one of the best choices for a secure wallet.
One way you can greatly speed up the initial sync process is to start with the bootstrap.dat file placed in your bitcoin core directory. This is a blockchain history that you can download with a torrent downloader, which is very fast.
Info about bootstrap.dat can be found on the core bitcoin site here: 
For Mac, you want to place the torrent-downloaded bootstrap.dat file here:
~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/

Maybe a better approach would be to incentivize that initial learning - curve pain by providing a discount to endure the effort like this :
Well you CAN pay with your credit card but if you get a bitcoin wallet first, I can give you a 10% discount right off the bat.

That's some pretty neat out-of-the-box thinking. Some reasons to use DTMF instead of modem could be that DTMF is less sensitive to poor-quality lines. For example fax or modem (essentially the same technology) would both require semi-decent link quality, whereas DTMF would likely be more forgiving.
I know you said it's intended for 1-way data transfer. But if you provided a minimum 2-way communication, you could facilitate a checksum like this, which would be an efficiency improvement:
1) Transmit XX data tones
2) Transmit a checksum
3) Receiver transmits ACK or NACK if the data thus far validates
3a) If NACK, then re-Transmit the last data block
3b) if ACK, then go back to  and transmit the next data block

Thanks for finding the link, yes I believe it was that podcast. My impression of the presenter was that he was "cocky" though I try not to judge based on that alone. But his tone with the audience was condescending which did make me question how valid his claims were. His arguments seemed to all be based on the assumption that elliptic curve crytography was weak and/or flawed. This is the first time I've ever heard someone make that claim, which he is obviously convinced was true.

I like your analogy between Blockbuster --&gt; Netflix
But I think it might be more like Apple --&gt; Android
Apple has a very closed ecosystem. They like to control everything to the nth degree. Yet they have a beloved product line that has reached mass adoption.
Android is on the opposite end of the spectrum and could almost be argued to be decentralized (I believe it is open-sourced). That means everyone can contribute to make it better. However, Android is not (yet?) as beloved as Apple, perhaps because it is still "rough around the edges"
I think bitcoin adoption, as well as credit card de-adoption, will follow a similar pathway over time. The bitcoin ecosystem will have to provide features that are SO MUCH BETTER than what is offered by the traditional system that it will cause the tide to shift.
Over time, I believe even people that may not want to use bitcoin will ultimately be forced to, because that will be the only way to get things they want in some cases. For example, some merchants will only accept bitcoin and buyers would then be forced to pay conversion fees to convert fiat to BTC if they choose to be obstinate.

Personally I would be careful to go with a mainstream well-known (read: well-trusted) distribution, to minimize that chance that rogue code would be injected.
For example, a less-well-known distribution could inkjet malware into their code, wrap it up all shiny with a bow, and it could go unnoticed for awhile.
If you use a distribution that has a trusted track record and many many users, then there is a better probability that it will be malware-free.
I personally recommend any of the Ubuntu variations. My 2 favorite ones are Lubuntu and Xubuntu.

Your plan sounds dangerous,  if that phone will have any online access at all...  Cellular or WiFi 
True cold storage means your private keys are never exposed to live Internet. One way to accomplish this is with Armory Wallet, using an inexpensive netbook you could purchase for about $50 on eBay.  I'm sure there are other ways as well. 
50 BTC is a lot of hard earned savings so I would definitely not keep those private keys ALL in a wallet that is connected to the Internet.

I think it will one day shift into pricing directly in BTC, but not until we reach mass adoption. For now, the bitcoin economy is still in the kindling phase... not yet the blazing fire economy. For now, people relate better to USD or their base currency when trying to adopt BTC I think.

After you setup Bitcoin Core and also Armory, there is no need to really (manually) launch the Bitcoin Core reference client. Instead, Armory will automatically launch bitcoind in the background when you startup Armory. bitcoind is the headless "service" which communicates with the blockchain.
So all your transactions would occur in Armory only. Armory will startup and shutdown the bitcoind service as needed.
Once you get the hang of Armory, you could also look into purchasing a cheap netbook (I got one for $50 on ebay) ... with that, you can reformat it with a fresh OS and install (only) Armory, and then keep it completely offline. With this you have air-gapped security -- and offline wallet for ultimate security.

When you open a trade request, the system automatically puts the Bitcoin in escrow. Don't cancel a trade request after you've already sent $. 
If you reopened a new request for the correct amount, it's possible the system re-escrowed the funds from the seller. Contact support and ask in this case. Perhaps they can simply release the coins to you by showing them your proof of payment.

I am also a fan of Lubuntu LTS (or any of the LTS versions of Ubuntu). LTS is important because that means the Ubuntu ecosystem will provide security updates for many years.  Typically the non-LTS versions, or possibly other linux distros, will only provide a much shorter window of security updates.
If you reach the end-of-life for your distribution, then it will just stop getting updates. That could be dangerous if you are depending on it for your bitcoin wallet or transactions.

I recently listened to a bitcoin podcast where the presenter argued that elliptical curve math is flawed, and he even went so far to predict that it would be cracked by 2015. I am no math expert, but i'd love if someone else could explain why or why not we should trust in this math? 
Is there an alternative? Is elliptical curve math only used in HD wallet schemes? And would the use of multi-signature negate any possibility of 'cracking' ?

I agree - I think the more bitcoin gets mentioned in mainstream media, preferably not cast in a negative light, the sooner it will reach mass adoption. 
Once businesses realize how easy and cheaper it is to use - then I think they will start to prefer it by offering discount incentives to use this over traditional payment methods (we saw that trend in some retailers when debit cards came onto the scene,  because it's generally cheaper for retailers to process debit than credit).  With even slight discounts, more general public will take interest in bitcoin to save those few extra pennies.

Cash by mail is anonymous but there is slightly more risk in that someone could intercept the cash before it reaches the seller. 
Postal Money Order would typically be made out to the seller,  so that means you've reduced risk in that nobody would probably intercept a money order (and I think you might even be able to claim a loss if the money order were never cashed) 
In both cases though,  you are trusting the seller not to just run off with the funds. LBC provides some ways to reduce this risk by checking the sellers reputation rating before you trade,  and also read up about their automatic escrow service. 
I am a fan of LBC

Thanks for your thoughts on this. My understanding of "hard forking" is that, in laymens terms -- it means that the rules-of-the-game suddenly change, and everyone agrees simultaneously (ie, the miners maintaining the blockchain). In that way, you could force a change of how the bitcoin protocol operates (please correct me if that's wrong).
So theoretically... please paint a picture of how it could work in the event of a major vulnerability, for example. Say someone comes up with a way to reverse-engineer a public key, in that it allows them to deduce the root key for an HD elliptic-curve set of keys (however unlikely that may be). So once that vulnerability would be identified, how could a hard-fork suddenly protect all the value stored in private keys moving forward?
If elliptic curve math could be broken, then it seems that the only way to protect ones wallet would be to transfer it into a different wallet produced in a different way. But how could a hard-fork differentiate between legitimate transfers and theft?
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

I think you shouldn't have to bash the US Dollar, and besides that could jeopardize your message and paint you as extremist to people who already know and trust the USD.
Instead, I would focus on bitcoin strengths as they relate to the USD. For example, holding value in bitcoin allows you to transact directly with merchants, but also easily convert to USD when desired.
Also inflation (is that terminology understood by the common folk?) Is virtually nonexistent, which is an extremely valuable point. If you store value today in bitcoin, it can exchanged in the future for USD with little to no inflation risk. My understanding is that the Argentine Peso is basically a wasting asset in this regard; ie not a reliable store of value.

It only requires downloading the blockchain for the online wallet (ie, where you would initiate a spend from). The private keys would be held in the offline instances used for signing only and do not require the blockchain.

The site provides a good overview for new users selecting their first wallet. In a simple presentation format, it teaches users how to compare wallets and what types of security features they may want to look for. It presents only the most popular wallets in its comparisons, which makes sense. With tens (hundreds?) of wallet softwares in the wild, a new user needs exactly this type of on-ramp to ensure their first choices in the bitcoin ecosytem are educated. This site does an excellent job of that.

I would personally get all the balances showing correct in the online Armory before doing any sweeping. Follow advice from above and make a copy of your offline data directory first, then upgrade Armory on the offline computer to latest (ie, versions should match offline and online). When you first run Armory after the upgrade, it should automatically handle any upgrades of the wallet data.
One thing to check - I ran into this myself - in the online version, check the properties of each wallet and make sure they are clicked 'owned by me' - one of the upgrades seemed to reset this setting, which caused Armory to not reflect my total personal balance. If I recall, you want the security status to show as 'offline' and not 'watching only'. This is only cosmetic but it does affect how Armory calculates your personal total balance.

Very good point... I should focus only on the transaction fees as the incentive for miners. I need to brush up on this myself as it seems a bit foggy at times. My understanding is that miners are working collectively to solve a puzzle (via random attempts) and as soon as one solves it, the block is complete and they win the reward. The reward should be viewed as an extra bonus lottery, perhaps not the primary incentive. But where I get foggy is this:
 - where do the transactions that are incorporated in the block come from? Are they all coming through the winning miner? Or do all the miners somehow collectively submit these transactions in a queue during the 10-minute period, and then the winning miner seals the block and incorporates them all into the blockchain?  Where are all the transactions located during the 10 minutes prior to solving the block?
You are right, 30 minutes is nowhere near enough. However, the audience doesn't yet know what I'm about to present. I'm using this as a working proof-of-concept for decentralized network computing among our midst, and what I believe is the future. It should not be so complex that a technical person cannot grasp a high-level understanding of how bitcoin and blockchain work in a span of 30 minutes (or else I haven't done a very good job at presenting it). I'm sure there will be many details that will not make it into the presentation, but I think my goal should be to leave the audience in a thinking/inquisitive state.
