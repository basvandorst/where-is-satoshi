The price of bitcoin started to decline way before withdrawal/deposit were halted on bitfinex  which means that they didn't stop transactions as soon as they knew about the hack but later. Don't tell me that yesterday's drop from 655 to 605 was a coincidence, this hack smells like an inside job. It's not the first time that there is some fishy thing going with this market.

Huh? Why would there be pro-globalization advocates in a bitcoin forum? 
Globalization restrict freedom because it restrict choice. 
Bitcoin is a tool for freedom because it seperates government from money creation/issuance not because it undermines nation states.  I often read that bitcoin is a replacement for cash, this is also very dangerous thinking , both should coexist. Freedom is about choice, the more choice the better. 
I'm curious what good things does TPP offer for freedom minded people?
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:07:38
Most services function this way. Say you want to send money to the philipines, you send bitcoin to a remittance site in the country and they will lock in the amount and send it to the person's bank account.
There is also abra which has a different model, you can read about it here  
Both will have some fee involved, 2- 3% is nothing compared to western union's 10-15% .
In an ideal world everyone would use bitcoin as the world currency and people would only pay the tiny transaction fee.

Most exchanges today will help you get around with this. The problem is that when you "launder" your coins, those coins never actually becomes clean, they have just changed owner. This means that the amount of tainted coins is growing by the day and if there is a new legislation that make these coins illegal, it will really hurt bitcoin. That's why i think anonymity built in the protocol is a pressing issue.
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:33:26
If you want to be paid in bitcoin just create a bitcoin wallet and post your QR code (wallet address) on your site.
Or you can use a payment processor like bitpay.com and they will convert the btc for you and send you fiat directly in your bank account.

Do you know how opening a channel will look like?  If bob want to send a payment to alice and they both have a common channel will the wallet automatically recognize that, what if they don't have a channel in common and they want to transact asap could they open a channel on the fly ? I know LN isn't ready yet so you may not have a definite answer, just looking for opinions.

I am talking globalization in the governance model here right. Today, laws are very differents from one country to another. This allows anyone to go to a different country if (s)he doesn't approve a new law in his/her own for example. This also creates an environment where each country compete with each other which is healthy. Diversity is key, a single global government can take a decision that will impact your life wherever you are on the planet, so in that sense your options are restricted due to globalization. No doubt that certain aspect of globalization are good but the cons far outweight the pros imo.
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:51:38
You talk about balance tool as if it was some amazing invention when it's in fact a service that dozens of sites have allowed you to do for years ( blockchain.info, preev.com, coindesk.com/calculator, gobitcoin.io/en , to name a few..). Pretty much every bitcoin wallet today have the option to display fiat equivalent.
Paper wallets are good for secure cold storage ( assuming they are not issued by a third party company). 
If you want to explain bitcoin in a tangible fashion just tell them to download breadwallet and start exchanging coins with them back and forth. Nothing is more tangible than a mobile phone right, people already do all of their banking on the phone. If they can't figure out how to use a simple app like this they will never understand the purpose of a paper wallet let alone what sweeping means.
As some have already said the intention is good but idea not so much. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:34:18

@_date: 2016-04-25 00:50:50
Combined with other tech maybe but i fear the complexity will prevent users to actually use these tools. 
I am also concern that these will become a niche product and not a standard if not implemented at the protocol level.Which means businesses could still refuse a transaction if origin is unknown.

There is like hundreds of free and easy to use wallets today. Man use your brain before creating a project. 
Startups that are successfull create new products,they innovate. You said 'trusting nothing requires technical knowledge'. How about try to overcome this challenge instead of reinventing the wheel.
As opposed to many in this thread i think that 2 of 2 multi-sig is actually not a bad idea, your challenge could be to make this very easy to use. Users have to checkout on your site at some point anyway, just have them fill order with their public key and an explanation on your site. Even if you fail to remove all complexity this product will still attract more technical bitcoiners so it's a win win. Just my 2 cents.

TPP will allow corporations to sue entire nation states through new type of court, this is very very bad because it gives yet again more power to corporations and less power to nations.
If you think that the end of nation states will liberate people think twice. Under a global government bitcoin could be banned overnight in every single country that's just one example.The race for more and more globalization is a serious threat to individual liberties and TPP is another tool to push globalization further.

Ever heard of " buy the rumor sell the news" ? 
The rumor was published a week ago (when the price started to climb) 
Profit taking started when the news came out, smart traders are always ahead of the game.
Sometimes though when the rumor doesn't actually give any hint as to the news then the price will spike on the actual announcement
Note: the little rally could have also been totally unrelated to steam.

Fungibility is *ucked already, just ask bitpay! They refused someone's payment due to coin origin, there is no reason why other businesses won't do the same especially if required by government. Anonymity at the protocol level is a pressing matter, developers don't seem to realize that.

I agree with this. Halving is what kept bitcoin standing despite scaling issue imo, if segwit is still not there once halving hype dies down then we will likely see the biggest transfer of wealth in crypto history.
People want to see things move forward, and that means code being merged.This issue has been going for far too long.There is a fine line between being overly cautious and being completely paralized and unable to get things done , they need to understand that this whole crypto thing is a new experiment and ultimately the ones taking the more risks are gonna be the winners.

Localbitcoins has built in escrow to protect buyers from scammers. When you mark payment as " complete" , seller's bitcoins are locked in escrow and can only be released to you or unlocked by moderator in case of a dispute.
So just make sure you mark payment as paid a few minutes before you actually paid and keep the deposit receipt. Also chose a vendor with good ratings. Cash deposit is very common way to buy bitcoin

You don't need coinbase to transact, in fact it is highly recommanded not to leave any bitcoin on their site. Once you have bought your bitcoins send them to a wallet you control ( trezor, ledger or apps like breadwallet or mycelium)

Try breadwallet if you have an iphone, works great for sweeping funds. Not sure what the problem is with electrum and armory. Maybe sweep balance with compressed or uncompressed private key ( you can check these on bitaddress.org) The 0.1 are definetely there so have not been swept yet.

 It's not as bad as it seems. If you think about it, exchanges today already have your name associated with an address, people who do illegal things already assume that this information can and will be handed over to governments. Not sure why the article says the price will drop because of that, i think it will actually give exchanges more legitimacy so the price will most likely rise. Every buyers who uses exchange should assume their btc address and name is already in a gov database somewhere.
Also I'm looking forward to things like tumblebit as they will be needed to maintain privacy. And bitsquare is going to blow up the day this happen :)

With a hardware wallet like trezor and ledger you can sign a transaction while you private key still remain offline.

Using third party like bitcoin mixers is not the best way to remain anon as you have no control what these sites will do with your information. The process you describe above is relatively safe but beware of time analysis, the more time between transactions the better.
If you want to be sure that your transactions are private you should mix your coins with cryptos that are really anonymous instead of using mixers.

It's not about a small 2mb increase anymore. It's about 2 differents path, BU where the block size is unlimited and core where the block size is very carefully increased after everything else has been tried. So you have a solution which will clearly put more centralized pressure in the future than the other. That's my understanding anyway.

1-2$ is a day's worth of work in many many countries of the world. 
Also there are blockchains with 0 fee and instant confirmation. Bitcoin won't compete with that, certainely not with 1-2$ fee.
Then there is this argument that bitcoin is a good store of value. Personnaly I think it's a good store of value so long as it has use cases, if people use other blockchains to transact bitcoin is dead as gold2.0.

A blockchain without a currency (incentive) is not a blockchain. It's what they call distributed ledger, it has very little to do with satoshi's invention, it's more like a fancy database. There is a lot of hype about "blockchain" but most people don't realize that you can't have a censorship resistant and secure blockchain without the currency unit. Both are inextricably linked.

Bitcoin's value is projected to appreciate because its inflation will slowly depreciate. Today 12.5 new bitcoins are "printed" every 10 min, every 4 year this number halves, in 2020 it will be 6.25 every 10 min,in 2024 it will be 3.125 e er 10 minutes.

@_date: 2016-12-05 05:54:07
People who think bitcoin could become digital gold without use cases are delusional. What gives bitcoin value is the fact that you can send any amount for almost free anywhere in the world instantly. This is what creates demand for bitcoin and support its price. People who buy gold as store of value don't buy it just because it has 21 m limit, this limit is meaningless if there is no demand for the currency. When I buy bitcoin I buy it because I expect bitcoin will be used as a currency in the future.
Gold has value because it has properties that other metals don't have and so it is used because of these properties, bitcoin is no different. If nobody takes advantage of its properties it's useless and so it's worthless

So if government regulate crypto in your country, businesses will just register in a crypto friendly country which will reap all the benefits of welcoming innovation. Many already have as a preventive measure I guess.

Also if government regulation are too strict even average people will dodge the law, we've seen this with cash already where people don't declare their under the counter income.

The advantage is that it's inflation proof. Even if banks offer the same efficiency as bitcoin their currency will always lose value over time.

It's a lot more stable today than when the price was below $200. There are still some wild swings but the price is finding equilibrum much faster. 3 years ago we used to have non stop volatility for weeks.

I should have said " the average sheep contributing to the enslavement of its own child " so that people wouldn't have taken my message personally, that's also one of the issue in our current society people don't want to take responsability, many know that something is wrong but they'd rather turn a blind eye.

How can a single person get a million billion IP addresses?
I understand changing the incentives isn't an easy fix but my point is that it should be on top of the list of the developers.
I don't see a future where (if bitcoin is a huge success) a few miners have control over the entire population's wealth, this make the network extremely vulnerable to government intervention or other attacks. Today this is no big deal because government doesn't see bitcoin as a threat but when/if bitcoin takes over the world shit will get real..

Wouldn't it be possible to set a limit of hashing power per node? 
I am sure some brilliant mind could find a way to encourage more miners, but this is essential for bitcoin to thrive.
A decentralized network which is bound to become more and more centralized is a broken decentralized network, satoshi gave us only half of the puzzle we need to find other half.
@_date: 2015-07-29 10:03:42
"forget bitcoin"  
oh yeah good idea, screw the miners! let's just hope they process transactions in "10 minutes" out of their kind heart.
The bitcoin vs blockchain argument is getting ridiculous, sometimes i wish satoshi would have called bitcoin 'blockchain' and blockchain 'Blockchain'.
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:08:03
It's worrying to see that a miner who messes up can potentially cause users to lose money. 
I don't have deep understanding of all the technical stuff, so sorry if theses questions sound silly but how are a few miners/mining pools more secure than thousands of miners around the world?
The current system by design incentivize mining to be more centralized which could potentially do serious damage on bitcoin seeing as this was not even intentional hiccup
Wouldn't a system where miners are incentivize to run multiple nodes be more secure ? 
As i understand it the system is secured by hashing power but what if the same amount of hashing power we have today was split between thousands or even millions of miners, wouldn't this be more secure?
I am sure i'm missing something here if anyone willing to clear this up for me would be nice.
@_date: 2015-07-04 07:00:05
As i said i'm really not technical at all but a node to me is an internet connexion/ IP address, so i would think that if we limit the hashing power per node then it would limit the hashing power per IP , i could be wrong you tell me?
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:47:03
I like the design. When can we use this? :)
@_date: 2015-07-04 06:48:46
How about this one:
The less hashing power the more chances you have to find a block ? :)
Or reward miners not for their hash power but something else like number of processed transactions/ node availaibility/drive space  or a way to reward every miners equally regardless of their hash power idk?..
I know some of these may sound stupid, just food for thought.

Apparently you didn't configure Tor properly and your IP leaked when you used your email account sometime in 2010. You are not safe.

I read somewhere that someone's LN wallet would have to be connected to the internet to receive payment, isn't this a major problem?
If i decide to close a channel and receive my BTC back, do you also get your fund automatically sent back? do i need to reuse the same BTC address for all channels to receive BTC back?
Will exchanges adopt the LN or not? since all transactions in the LN are not final how could exchanges adopt this technology?
Do you know if the LN network will be compiled in a single software with core or will people have to download the 2 and run them seperately/
