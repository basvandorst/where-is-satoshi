Most certainly not! No bank with any sense of security for their customers would consider using SOFORT.  This completely relies on "trusting" a third party in between you and your bank and it just reeks of trouble to me.  Safello is a Swedish company, but banks in Sweden will unlikely ever support SOFORT.

Someone e-mail dustin.se and komplett.se see if they follow suit as well! Great news for Sweden bitcoin scene!

How about the studios release it themselves and then accept money for the episodes via BTC and other avenues?
Or studios embrace the future and create a wallet for each show and perhaps uploaders/fans will donate back to them?
Who knows!

Jönköping, Sweden reporting in!
Reddit &amp; Bitcoin are quite international my friend :)
@_date: 2014-01-12 08:59:00
Oh and they buy your bitcoins for 5 179 SEK which is a 8.724% LESS then what they are actually worth.  Ridiculous profit margins, greedy greedy greedy.

Just a suggestion, isn't it more prudent to open source it before you start handling the new large influx of business so that the code can be scrutinized by the internet?  Just a thought...
Doesn't sound like a good strategy to open the flood gates and only after that checking the dam for cracks....

Apologies, I did not mean that Jönköping was recognized as "Bay Area" but I merely wanted to illustrate the geographical diversity.
I still believe more information should be given.  You can't expect everyone to know where "Bay Area" is so more information would clarify this for the entire subscriber base and not just US and those who are knowledgeable about US geography.  
Case and point: "Bay Area" to me says nothing.

Bitcoin in popular music YES!
Not too sure this will become popular though...
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:21:25
Will it be available for live streaming live worldwide?

I e-mailed the dustin.se and komplett.se we'll see what they reply!

I love the idea.
I hate that they are GREEDY.
Current USD price for a BTC on Bitstamp: 874.20 US Dollar equals
This converted to SEK using current exchange rate: 5674.26 Swedish Krona
What they sell one coin for: 6090SEK
6.8266% increase over market value.  No thank you!

I suggest using the link in the official Vuze website, this picture seems very fishy!
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:35:55
Couldn't agree more and I think a post which illustrates this issue is the perfect place to talk about it.

I have heard murmors of the website they call MtGox.
Unfortunately, I fear when we arrive they might be closed for Raiding due to transaction overflows...

Kapition looks very nice too, can you motivate your answer? Good experience with them? Do you prefer them to bitstamp, and if so, why? Just trying to get a good feel for the websites before chosing one!
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:56:48
Hei! For the sake of our world brethren, let's stick to English.
Thanks for the tip, the website seems very clean and fully featured (two-step authentication is very nice indeed).  
Good rates in your experience? Reliable? Secure?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:07:30
I'm not looking to buy any right now, but in the future :)
Thanks for the tip, bit stamp looks solid!
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:15:03
Bra, tack!
