What is going on? ETF denial announced, price drops to $6280 range. Then a quick jump back up into the $6400s.  Does this mean ETF damage is over or won't really hit until Asia and tomorrows press starts reporting it?
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:45:40
Yep, there it is!
@_date: 2018-08-10 10:04:01
Ok, ta.
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:44:22
Why is there such a variance in value of Bitcoin between exchanges? Bitcointicker has it at $6351 on BitStamp and Bitfinex, but on Coinbase it's $6556. $200 dollars.
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:53:16
I know market confidence is low, but the price for Bitcoin is, relatively, cheap. Maybe this situation will play out like the end of April when there was that sudden bullrun of a $1K increase in less than 30 minutes and then it went up to $9000. Possibly next week?!
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:53:28
An excellent summation! I've been checking the price of an alt that was just dripping down in value then out of nowhere this pump. I was going to un-tether but I've been down this road before!
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:17:21
Morning all! Could this me the start of a mini pump and dump cycle? Jump in at 10k jump out at 12.5k.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:29:33
Of course! But at the moment no news is good news.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:19:20
I think it's likely it will happen. *If* you believe this too and have Bitcoin why HODL? Better to sell then when it gets to a lower point buy back in and get a little bit more for your money.

There's no negative news affecting Bitcoin so I don't see it falling too far down. As it's been 24 hours at almost $8K something's got to give! All that pent up emotion... everyone will NEED to buy. This is it people, get your $8100 memes ready!
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:47:05
I like it! I need to get me one of those. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:13:31
Thanks for your list of possible reasons. I was aware of the Mt.Gox thing and understand the sell off has been over a period of a few months, but I guess the news was sudden.
With point 2, once (if) 6k is shown to be a true bottom does that then give the markets confidence in Bitcoin because it means each one is worth a guaranteed 6k?
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:53:41
Can you tell us anything about your experience that would make your algorithm have some value? 
Also why not give everyone here a free week, or at the very least, a one day trial to discover how this system works? If people don't know who you are you could be selling magic beans like this scammer I've come across on Twitter selling Bitcoin predictions. If your confident in your system I definitely would offer a trial - I would love it if this system works!
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:59:05
The big news of the day is that Google is banning cryptocurrency ads. I'm sure that will affect market confidence
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:23:58
That's a great explanation, thank you. 
These people doing this co-ordinating, surely it's a good idea to be part of their circle so you avoid being exploited?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:55:01
I appreciate the advice - I wish I read it 2 minute ago! I'm happy to say I own a tiny bit more then I started the day with. It's difficult balancing what's more important to you, not making losses or potential profits. Today I didn't want to make any losses. It will go up. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:48:21
Thanks for the reply and the insights. I will look deeper into what you’ve said to hopefully learn more. Ta.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:02:30
And now the price is going up a bit $200+. Some more pumping before the dump. I’m beginning to think there is something to the whale conspiracy theories!
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:33:42
The drop to 6k two weeks ago was supposedly linked to the drops in the worldwide stock markets. There isn't any similar external factors now so what do you see making it drop that hard?
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:10:34
Speaking from my own experience, it's better than being invested in Bitcoin and seeing the price fall for an hour.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:58:36
I've been ringing around trying to find a copy, but nowhere seems to have it in stock.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:47:33
Loads of news media on twitter reporting the price drop below $8k including MSNBC and Bloomberg. Does this then mean that the market will react and sell more?

@_date: 2018-03-29 22:22:35
So after touching $6999 it's now shot up to $7190. I'm wondering if it's because the clever investors know it wouldn't have gone any lower so jumped back in for the run upwards?
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:39:28
Im trying to guess when the US wake up will they see this price of $7600 and think BUY or SELL?  There’s no stock-market issues so more likely buy?
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:35:25
Considering how it was dropping at the end of the week and it has recovered to almost $9.5k on the weekend I think that it's a really good sign. Come Monday it will go up some more. But if the market is still feeling cautious I wonder if it will be able to get to $12k. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:05:30
Right now, it's fallen to less than $10,100.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:39:04
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:12:21
I just saw a whole load of sells on Bitcointicker - i'm wondering if those are automatic. It's now $7999 and moving downwards.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:32:32
That's exactly what it is! The price is just hanging, hovering. Taunting!
@_date: 2018-03-24 02:16:46
This pump seemingly came out of nowhere, could it have been coordinated?
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:09:15
I’ve had to cash out my tiny position- confidence is low.
@_date: 2018-03-28 09:44:03
That's a very wise comment - it has no place amongst the hodlers and traders here who are all trying to hustle the inexperienced. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:15:01
In half an hour.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:08:42
That's it exactly! All the media who have to write something about it will be using the words CRYPTOCURRENCY, BITCOIN and BANNED. Traders are not likely to be troubled by this but they will be conscious of the casuals reactions. 
I'm new to all this so I've got no idea what will happen when the USA wakes up. Either they will sell too or not - and I'm not going to charge anyone for that financial advice!
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:27:52

@_date: 2018-03-28 17:43:07
In theory this is great. But you would have to be coordinating many thousands of fish who only have minuscule amounts of Bitcoin compared to one giant whale who only needs to take a dump to cause reverberations throughout the ocean.  
Don't people use Telegram groups for this sort of thing?

I think we're at the point were investors are everyone is wondering *'will it go down further or should we jump back in?'*
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:35:06
When the price went down to $9400 there was a fake guru who said the price would fall to $7000. He of course got it wrong. Price is up to $10600.  Is this a good time to get in the game or does anyone predict more falls?
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:48:13
I don’t understand any of what you said apart from ‘profit!’ How are you doing it?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:30:22
That's a valid point - but only if you sell at 7K.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:39:26
All good. $50 is a big ask for an unknown quantity. I will wait to hear other's feedback. Good luck with your project.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:12:20
That sounds good. I'd love there to be a helpful resource. So observing your own system how accurate have *you* found the predictions be over the past month?
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:11:57
Sure, but as long as the movement is up then it could be a productive week.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:39:39
So true!
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:22:54
I'm sceptical of any rise because come 3-4 am GMT the price tends to drop. I'm not sure if that's because the whole world is in bed or what.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:56:07
Ok, ta.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:29:48

@_date: 2018-03-14 17:45:31
Do you think that will have an impact?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:26:27

Baby steps but yes, $10k would be lovely! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:43:48
The price has been roughly around the $8500 mark for the last 36 hours. It's like a pregnant pause of traders wondering if it's going to turn bullish on the path to ATH, or down? If nothing happens within the next 12 hours I think the whales and day traders will be doing a little dumping in time for the next round of pumping.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:24:20
So if Asia see the price has fallen, is it more likely that the people who want to buy in will outweigh the people who panic sell?
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:27:48
Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:00:38


Brilliant! :) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:29:48
True. But there is a limit that is too low to buy a Bitcoin. In the UK it’s £750, then £3000... with slow increases after that. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:27:51
Price is going downwards and there are a few articles about it. If Bitcoin falls below $10,000 will it likely scare a lot of people into panic selling?
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:01:17
Good morning all! So yesterday we didn’t have the massive crash the doomsayers were predicting. We reached a plateau of approximately $7900. Now’s it’s time for the whales and daytraders to make their money for the week - and I want a small piece of it. I’d like to see a steady pump to $9000 - are you with me?!
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:58:44
Another pump! Now over $8300.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:46:27

I'm beginning to understand the belief that there really are some mystical whales/ big players who are manipulating the market! On Sunday the 18th BTC fell to about $7400. It then shot up to $8K and stuck around that for a bit before climbing to $9K. At the time of writing the price stagnant, everyone is waiting to see if this will go down or up...
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:08:35
My *newbie* observations:  Firstly, people want to HODL, they want to not focus on market conditions. They'd rather wait as they have a belief that the coin's value will rise to a super high. However that HODL dream is disrupted by the day traders who only care about making money every day. They will buy on what they see is the day's low then sell on the day's high. However this selling disrupts the HODL dream. The only way the day traders will HODL is if there is a serious momentum behind it as with the mainstream media of late 2017.  
With all these fluctuations it makes me wonder if the predictions of $1million or even $50K are actually realistic?
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:53:39
This is serious. The Bitcoin blockchain is housing pornographic and abusive images. So potentially this means anybody running a node or lightning node is guilty of child abuse porn offences? If this is true then this could definitely blow up into a international governments conversation about regulating Bitcoin.
My tech knowledge of Bitcoin is rudimentary - I didn't know it was possible to store other non currency info in the Blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:12:29
In less than 30 minutes the price has gone from $7546 to $7839, almost a $300 increase. So is this the market just picking up or is it deliberate buying from whales for their next pump and dump?
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:20:42
I've been using *Coinbase* for my dabbling with Bitcoin daytrading. I have found that whatever the price is on Bitcointicker.co, Coinbase's price is approximately $130 less. Is this because Bitcointicker's price is a cumulative value of different exchanges or because Coinbase's listed value of Bitcoin is bad?  I once sold a small amount, then bought back when it was $300 cheaper and I broke slightly better than even.
I am going to try *GDAX* but need a second ID.

So... how low will it go? I’m thinking not too much. If it goes sub $10000 then buyers will jump back in.    What have you lifers observed in the past?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:00:26
I think it’s realistic that it will go up to at least $9000. So anybody who jumps in now would make $1k per BTC.

I read this on the website of Twitter 'expert' who sells predictions: 'We expect a TREND for Bitcoin to transform into a DOWN TREND or REVERSAL TREND within the next 24/48 hours (*Current time 11PM, Australia East, 17 February 2018)
- The expected bottom is $7,630 (with a possible 32.75% retracement)
- The expected bottom should be reached 2 March 2018

- We then expect to have an UP TREND on 8 March 2018'

Hi. I'm new(ish) to crypto and was wondering if any of you long timers have any thoughts on this issue. Does non-crypto and non-financial related news ever has an effect on the buoyancy of the crypto markets? For example we're nearing the climax of the football World Cup. If for example England were to win, it would apparently create a mood of optimism for the British. Would that also translate to British crypto traders feeling more confident or bullish?
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:25:03
Interesting point.
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:47:09
A big dip is going to make anyone invested pessimistic! But as long as the comments and predictions are sincere then that should be okay because discussion of Bitcoin invariably means having to discuss the negative as well as the positive. 
What I think is the root of the problem is that people think negative comments in the reddit have the power to negatively impact the Bitcoin value, but (from what little I know) the worldwide market is so much bigger that this place and won't feel any repercussions just because of someone not loving it.
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:16:06

The Bitcoin worldwide market is massive, it’s not influenced by a small English language forum.

Hi people, there is a person on twitter who sells a market prediction graph/service. He has been making some pretty bold claims:
“26 hours 30 minutes before Wall Str start their Bitcoin sell-off. First it will start in Hong Kong, then USA. It will be over a period of 8 hours - start time will be 2018-02-24 01:30:00:00 UTC Time. False UP “spike” could happen be aware not to enter buys [not financial advice]”
“I don't know how to explain this better guys, but current Bitcoin break out is a false one - the drop is still coming and going into the end of this month and into first week of March Bitcoin will be at a LOW. Final LOW is expected on Friday the second of March 2018 - $7630/7830”
I haven’t named him because I’m not sure if it is breaking Reddit rules and I don’t want to be promoting him. Also he has a number of people replying to him who are almost zealotry in their deference to his supposed genius that they all stink of fake accounts. 
However in light of the Bitcoin price, roughly, stagnant around $10000 for the last 24 hours I’m just wondering if the explanation about a Wall Street sell-off makes any sense or is total BS?

I respect your honesty. Let's not lie to ourselves, the market is BAD. The price of bitcoin is descending finding lower lows. But my hope is that that this is just part of a cycle. More financial institutions are investigating their own futures in crypto and there could be some legitimising of the industry. Come November, December I would hope to see bitcoin reach a value of $15k+. If it's not even hitting 8k then I will be concerned about its long term viability and take action accordingly.
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:52:18

Of course we all want markets to go up, but we know they also go down. Open discussion about that IS allowed and mods shouldn't be suppressing opinions just because some have a different view. 
Is there a way to know who did this so you can report them?

Everyone's waiting to see who will blink first the bulls or the bears? Will it soar to $8000 or crash to $7400?  
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:51:43
TA analysts’ calculated predictions are just that, predictions. They are subject to market conditions. 
As it happened this particular TA didn’t go as low as the person predicted, but I’ve learnt my lesson to not take someone’s TA as an exact prediction of the future.
Rather the best thing to do is consider a handful of TAs from trusted persons and they can give an indicator of market conditions and whether the price will move up or down. In this instance bitcoin fell from $6370 to $6040 briefly. Shortly after that was posted! But that price must have been so tempting to buyers, it shot up.   You have to play it by ear! ����

**1 bitcoin will fall to $6042 by tomorrow morning 0800 GMT.** It will fall to $5870 by Saturday 0700 GMT before it can move back up.  Put your money into USDT then buy the dip. Make $$$ on the bounce.

Do you think there's a bigger dump to come?

You're right about not being beholden to the advice of others, one should broaden their own knowledge - which I hope to do.

Hi. How do you know if there's a sell-off coming, is it based on data or a hunch?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:38:02
The big drop will have caused doubt in the market. Tonight I think Bitcoin’s value is more likely to go down. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:11:51
When the US wake up and see the Bitcoin for $6580, will that make them buy at a perceived good bargain or panic sell?
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:29:01
A-ha! So they are invested in Bitcoin and see the benefit of it going higher and then they make a big buy to spur the market forward?
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:56:03
Hey people. I missed out on the value jump on Thursday and would like some honest advice am I not making the right calls. Is now a bad time to jump in? Is it a bull trap that will rise and fall? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:39:53
That’s another observation of the status - but not an explanation!  The whole market can’t be waiting? Perhaps the mystic ‘whales’ are wondering what move to make.
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:05:52
Nope - more like $6600. :(
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:05:17
Is there such a thing as a 'good whale?' 
Something or someone helped with that spike to $9200. And there was that news story that one person/entity purportedly pushed the price of Bitcoin up last year. 
If true then that means somebody is pushing to get the value higher!
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:39:01
Nice! I think I said it on Sunday - $10,000 by Friday.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:33:01
what did he say?
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:10:39
Many Bitcoin TA experts on twitter are talking about a bearish divergence today, however they say it's a good thing! Because then buyers will jump in and boost the price up further.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:53:08
Has he got his wings yet?
@_date: 2018-07-04 23:13:27
I do get where you're coming from but I don't think one should blame journalists - they are simply reporting on the state of the market.

I follow a few people on Twitter who make calculations and share charts on the expected movements of BTC. About a week ago the BTC price went down and they're all writing about a bearish market. A couple of days it went up a little bit and they were all reacting saying this is the start of the bullrun and pointing out all the indicators. Today BTC has dropped a bit and they're mostly forecasting a drop to $7400 or less and possibly a drop to &lt;$6800.
Tell me something people, am I right in thinking that in Twitter-Bitcoin-land nobody knows shit?
@_date: 2018-04-18 10:25:11
The Independent is a respected British newspaper. I understand that one might not like the subject of the news but a reactionary post won't discredit its truthfulness. The worldwide Bitcoin market is huge and won't likely be influenced by this forum.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:34:41
Do you think it could fall to $6500?
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:32:01
Time to buy, or will this go down further?
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:01:00
Thanks for the advice. I admit I was on the outside - but only because all the 'analysts' on Twitter kept saying it was going to drop. Next time I will listen to my instinct. I'll just have to wait this out.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:32:47
$6900!  $7500 here we come!
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:58:24
Just out of interest, what are people setting their stop loss at?
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:19:47
It's been so weird. Yesterday hovering around $6600 for nigh on 24 hours. Now at the $6850 mark. It *seems* like there are people playing with the market so I wouldn't be surprised to see another mini pump to $7500 but who knows?!
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:48:29
Funny - I like your gallows humour!
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:57:21
So the financially prudent strategy of a Bitcoin trader is to set aside hooker expenses and disposable income and reinvest it into Bitcoin during a dip?

I will do the same - i can't do any worst than I currently am.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:11:26
You're probably right. $6600 is (was) a bargain. I'm thinking that surely there has to be a little pump up before the weekend.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:48:23
You can confidently say that AFTER it hits $7000.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:48:20
Perhaps. But this could be another *rinse and repeat* where the clever non-hodlers jump out and push it down towards $7600. Am also reading armchair analysts on Twitter predicting a drop to $6000.  So who knows?
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:25:01
You did the right thing as most 'experts' had calculated that it was going to drop - so why sit and wait for it to happen? You're stops mean you can jump back in when the market moves.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:32:57
Where's the thread for the 24th April - why's it disappeared?
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:40:18

@_date: 2018-04-20 19:44:06
So when looking at the moving average what sort of period do you look at; the last month, the last six? What does your MA analysis say this is?
I mean I thought that Bitcoin would reach and probably beat its ATH but not until November / December this year when there would be a greater media focus.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:37:26
If this imitates Friday's play it will go up to **$7,100**!
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:35:14
I just saw a fast drop to $7280. Is this the day traders cashing out?

@_date: 2018-04-10 13:11:45
*If* the market follows what happened on Friday it will remain relatively static around that for a good few hours before shooting up to $7100 with a chance to make a little profit.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:31:51
So every TA 'expert' with their chart predictions didn't see this.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:13:39
They say *Never look a gift-horse in the mouth* but it's important to have answers. How was the price kept hovering above $7000? How did it shoot up? Definitely some manipulation here.
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:55:49
It could be. If they create rules so exchanges somehow are able to ban deliberate sell and buy walls that are placed there to control the value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:08:59
Is this sudden movement/ price manipulation a new phenomena that only affected Bitcoin after the all time high value, or has it been a part of Bitcoin trading for much longer?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:04:00
Now *that* was orchestrated! Does anyone know which groups do this signalling?
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:12:25
I appreciate the explanation. I think I will need to dedicate some proper time to studying this! Thanks again.
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:27:08
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:21:39
I hope that's true!
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:05:44
No we have to wait for the HODLERS to sell so BTC can drop to $7400 then everybody on the sidelines (including me) who have some hardcore FOMO see this as a last opportunity so jump in, then you have the volume, then we can all go to the moon!
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:12:59
What time is the pump happening?

Will you accept payments in Tron?
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:27:04
It was waving at $7k.
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:16:43
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:16:25
**Surely a drop down to $7000 is a great thing?** I know everybody has hopes of going to the moon this month, but if you had Bitcoin before the spike up to $8400, then sold and it falls to $7000 then you have made yourself some lovely profit for the next round! 
It also means that all the doom and gloom from last week and predictions of $4k bitcoin is now over. The feeling this week is upbeat because it has demonstrated, proven, that there will be a lot more bullruns in 2018. 
So sell now, let it fall to $7000. Other traders will jump in, FOMO.  Then buy in with an increased position for the real bullrun!

Thanks for replying.  I was confused because I had used it before.  
In this instance I was setting the price to slightly lower and slightly higher than the current value of BTC.  So a Limit Post Only can only be placed if it is for a lower price than the current value of BTC or not too close to the current value?
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:49:44
Damn experts and their TAs...   True talk, is Bitcoin going up  or will there be a correction coming?
