Congrats! Yes, you can start receiving/buying BTC with a with your BTC address. 
 
This is a good site to learn more about Bitcoin.

Always double check the first 2-3 numbers/letters of sending and receiving addresses.  
Bread wallet is great. Simple, easy to understand. Post your address and I'll send you a few bits. You can then send back to try out or keep to use.

Awesome site! What  does betcoin think of your rakeback service?

Coinbase has an option to auto buy btc each day/week/month. If you want to accumulate and save. This would be a good approach. 
Coinrebates is a service to earn bitcoins by using sites such as Walmart, Best Buy, etc. This is good to earn bitcoin. 
Bread Wallet is a great app to use and store small amounts of bitcoin. 
There is a chance of return on investment, like any other security. I'd argue against losing "everything" unless you send all your Bitcoin to an address you can't send back. 
Start small and buy on a well known exchange. Get used to and comfortable with sending btc to others first.

Are you refreshing in Excel? If you are, there will be a text in the bottom left corner that will say "Running Background Query" which fetches the data. The data is based on daily prices so it only changes by day.

That's so awesome and you are very kind! 
Envest Microfiance is not a charity but a Micro-finance institution that brings investors to invest in micro finance loans on a free-market approach. I spoke with them a while back and they were interested in possibility using bitcoin to help move funds between countries. I don't believe they have used it yet but maybe in the future.

Interesting excerpt: "Monetary crises: Throughout history, monetary, financial, and economic crises tend to occur at fairly regular intervals. These crises could be isolated to one country, one region, or even be global but, regardless, when traditional money and finance doesn’t work well, people tend to seek alternatives and for many, the next crisis will be the first time that bitcoin is an available alternative."

Why did you want to sell bitcoins for PayPal dollars? Is there a plan for you to liquidate the bitcoins for cash? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:07:12
Same here. I do $200/mo. Since 2015 this has an avg yield of 9% per month. Traditional investment advice says invest only what you can afford. Reality in bitcoin proves this wrong.

Governments would not interfere with bitcoin for price fixing. They would interfere with the companies who mine the coins and the illegal activity they are doing. This is a big difference to note.
It would be an illegal activity depending on where the companies are incorporated in. 
Of course miners could gather together and try to make the min to fees larger. I don't see this as a viable business decision for anyone in the mining space. A smart miner wouldn't spend time trying to form a cartel, they'd spend time and effort focusing on generating larger hashing power. IMO it would be guaranteed income (more hashing) rather than illegal/immoral or wasteful time. As seen with when mining pools started gaining over 51% of the hashing power, some members left to nine with other miners for concern of a 51% attack.

I had an issue with my vault recently and put a request to Coinbase. It wasn't tracked and got an email about but wasn't in their system. I had to resubmit it but they responded promptly. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:42:32
Geography. Check the exchange rates in India. It's more than coinbase b/c it's difficult to get access to these exchanges and banking systems, therefore higher exchange rates

I love bitcoin and invest in it but would never do this with my 401k. Use your play money to invest in BTC.
On the bright side, at least you won't get margin called!

If you are using today's date, it may not work because the closing price history hasn't updated and the unique URL isn't created. Try tomorrow. If this doesn't work, PM me with a screenshot of the editor and I'll look at it.

It will update based on the close of each day. The metrics will adjust slightly. Not important on a daily basis but more important on a monthly basis.

Magnr seems legitimately ran and well intentioned. Much smaller rate of return but backed by a company and people who are out in the open in the bitcoin world.

Time to cut your losses and start anew with a reputable exchange. It may be not worth spending all this time and money trying to get your coins back from a cryptic company website in a foreign jurisdiction. 
Sorry for your loss man.

Thanks, I asked the brother of the bride and he thinks it would be a great gift. He said it would be up to her and the husband to accept it and use it (if ever) but thought it is thoughtful. I do have some background in the bitcoin space as I'm studying it for my Masters. So it's not like I'm just the crazy bitcoin guy trying to push my views. Thanks for the insight, Im going to think how to tailor it gently.

UNIC MSc student soon to be graduate here.
I joined the program because I was interested in Bitcoin but didn't know where to go to get credible information on the subject. I was grateful to spend the time taking the free intro class that Andreas co-taught with George. I learned a lot about the tech and industry from that class which encouraged me to enroll in the course. 
The pros of the course: learning from teachers about the subject and also learning from them on how to navigate this new technology. Bitcoin changes perceptions on not only how people view money but also how people teach about money. It's great to see curiosity from the teachers in this course. Fellow students in the course have gone on to submit research papers and create exchanges in different countries where Bitcoin is nascent. 
Classes included: Money and Banking, Financial Management, Digital Currency Infrastructure, innovations in developing countries and a few more. 
Education is what you make of it. Many people I know can go through a long history of learning cryptography and computer science at a prestigious school in the US but end up getting a job writing about how Bitcoin can't scale because of transaction volumes and past innovations strategies.
If you have any questions about the course that the Uni can't offer, PM me. I'm glad to help.

Kudos to you brother for dodging her and making smart decisions.
Weirdly a bit funny now as to how the public can view bitcoin at the current time. The decisions that could help people (Not liquidating and saving) tend to be accepted with vile and manipulation. Reminds me of the Denzel Washington movie - Book of Eli. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:52:35
I agree with most of what you said but don't understand that once the market cap grow, it will naturally be stable. Apple's stock, Ukraines Hyrvnia or oil prices all have trading volumes quite larger than btc but they are not considered stable stable. They lack one of these three. A fixed exchanged rate that a fiat currency would peg to btc would diminish its currency. They would give up their independent monetary policy by doing this.

Reasons not to invest in bitcoin:
 - You don't have any money to invest
 - You think it is not priced accurately
Reasons to invest in bitcoin:
 - You think it is priced cheaply
 - You may want to use it some day
 - Fun money investment
 - Once you buy some you will want to learn more about it.
Don't buy the hype or hysteria of it going to $10K or $0. Invest smart like anything else, think critically and make an informed decision.
