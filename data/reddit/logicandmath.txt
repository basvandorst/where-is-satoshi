Yes, a good percentage of businesses have a CC surcharge.  I expect the CC companies tried to get the law passed in Oz that they did in the US, but there's an act here called the Trade Practices Act which is overseen by an agency called the ACCC.  They would have rejected that principle outright, and any contractual terms inserted that forced merchants to do so would have meant pretty heavy fines until they were removed.
A lot cheer-leaders for credit-card companies don't understand that the way US companies control your laws, especially relating to financial services, is pretty fucked for the average american consumer.

Old enough to see bulletin boards introduced, let alone the internet.  Flooz is not bitcoin.  Nor is it a credit card.  It is an alternate to a credit card without any real benefits.  And yet, without bulletin boards, you probably wouldn't have the internet.
Bitcoin on the other hand already has uses.


Found.  My point.  You are looking at five-year-old technology, and can't grasp that credit-cards had exactly the same issues when they were introduced, for exactly the same reason.  They also took a lot longer to gain traction too.  People like you thought exactly like you do today about bitcoin.  And unlike flooz, there has actually been several billion pumped directly into it, not even counting the several orders of magnitude more that have simply exchanged hands by consumers.

The private key, aka the wallet sender, is just a number that is so large, no-one can actually guess it, or will ever create a duplicate one.  You keep a record of that, and using that number, if there are bitcoins assigned to it, you can send bitcoins to any other address.  If you lose it, there's no getting it back.  You can print it out (it's just a number), or even create a screen-capture of it.  You can even write it out, if you trust your handwriting.  Oh... when I say 'number', it really is a number, but people translate those numbers into letters so you don't have to type out as much. 
The public key, aka the wallet reciever, is just a number that is so large, no-one can actually guess it, or will ever create a duplicate one.  You give that public key to anyone you want to give you money.  The public key is created by using a mathematical algorithm on the private key.
The private key and the public key are linked, in that you can generate a public key from a private, but can't do it back the other way.  A private key can have multiple public keys, that you can give to anyone.
With someones public key, and your private key, you create a 'transaction' that is handed off to a public ledger for processing.  Even then, you don't hand over the private key.  It's still private.  When it is processed, your private key value is decreased by the value of the transaction, and the public address you sent the value to assigns it to the private key that is linked to it.
'tis amazing stuff.

No, he is not correct.  The 2% is applied to PURCHASES of bitcoin at coinjar, not reconciliation to fiat.  So the exchange is was 2.2%, which is lower than the exchange rate fee of fiat through a bank like the NAB which charges over 5%, without including the exchange rate fees.
There are legitimate potential issues with the purchase of bitcoin in Oz  :
... but for transferring money **to** Oz, it is far cheaper than using traditional methods, if you used coinjar, and there are probably cheaper options that that too.  So the cost using coinjar for transfer to Oz would be 2.2% at the current exchange, not the 5% he indicated.  And compared to traditional methods, the costs of which, would be even higher.
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:24:53
haha... ya just can't do it.  To admit that it hasn't affected take-up (which it hasn't) completely negates your entire premise.  I know it.  You know it.  Anyone that chooses to read this exchange knows it.  You can't even put them into the same frame-work, because even you know that that is taking the wrong side of a losing argument.
Zero-confirmation transactions have absolutely no bearing on the security of using bitcoin for micropayments, any more than using tap-n-go does.  You are more likely to lose the money of the purchase for accepting tap-n-go than you are because of any theoretical (and it IS only theoretical) issue with problems of accepting zero-confirmation purchases.

Sure there is.  Bitcoin won't lose value like my dollars do.  As has been stated previously.  It's also inherently more secure.  If I lose my phone, I still have my dollars.  I get the security of not carrying the cash with me (i.e. a credit card) without the fees of the credit card, and I can keep my money from debasing in value!  Not only that, unlike my bankcard in my country, I can use my bitcoin in any country, and not pay currency exchange rate fees.

Oh lordy... How about you actually check that before you start accepting 'free advice'.
The current bitcoinaverage price is 475.7.  The current coinjar price is 486.2.  That's 97.8%.  If you've got dollars to exchange using a money exchanger, you're going to pay far more in fees, and you're also going to pay a fee for transferring the money internationally.  The exchange rate offered between USD/AUD by the National Australia Bank is 88c on the US dollar, which is a ~5% commission on the sale of dollars vs the actual exchange rate of 93.3.
If your Oz person has a coinjar account, they can send you the receive address.  You use that to send money to them, and they can cash out to their bank account at any time.
Frankly, the guy who just gave you that advice is an idiot who has had that reddit account for ONE HOUR.

I have an iphone, and I've used Bity, Breadwallet, Bitwallet, Blockchain, CoinJar and CoinPocket.
The best one I've found is CoinPocket out of them.  The best part of that one is that it **easily** allows you to save your private key in another location outside of the device, so you can get it back if you lose your phone.
Reviews :
- CoinPocket - All around good wallet.  The one I use as my primary phone wallet.
- CoinJar - Managed wallet, so no access to private keys.  I use it as my primary exchange though.  When I generally buy bitcoin, it appears in this wallet.  I then transfer it out to the wallets I use on a day-to-day basis.
- Blockchain - Issues with QRCode scanning, and complex interface.  Very powerful though, in that you can directly link webpage access to your wallet with your phone.  I keep it on my phone, but don't use it.
- Bity - Godawful interface.  But very powerful, and allows you to create transactions and post them directly to the blockchain.
- Breadwallet - too difficult to access private keys
- BitWallet - Bad crashing on several occasions required re-install of app to get it working again.  The last time it did this, I just unloaded it for good.

The fact that the repeal of the glass-steagall act was pretty well a personal favor of Bill Clinton to [Robert Rubin]( an ex board member of goldman-sachs, and a a then-director of citigroup, which ultimately became citi, kind of goes some way to demonstrating my point.

No, you're the one who's confused.  You should read the article I just provided.  People like you regularly get 'credit' and 'credit card' mixed up.  'credit' was around a long time before 'credit cards' were, and the credit facility was being used for many years (inefficiently) before the long-term adoption of the card itself.  There's nothing stopping people providing a 'credit' facility for bitcoin, if that's what they choose to do.  Credit, and it's counterpoint, debt, has been around for centuries.  The fact that you don't know this, even after I've demonstrated this exactly, kind of proves my point.  
I've given plenty of examples of comparable adoption rates.  Faster even.  Want to compare paypal next?  (hint : over 5 years before it turned a profit, and it was floated for 60million dollars five years after it was created.  Look up coinfinity some time) What you've done, is point to a confusing mish-mash of disparate ideas, most of which are unrelated (i.e. credit vs credit cards), and peppered the mish-mash with emotive words like 'fatal' and 'punctured'.
So... I've broken down the bitcoin price argument (oil?  real-estate?).  I've broken down the credit argument.  (start a bitcoin credit facility if you want... oh that's right, [it already exists](  I've broken down the adoption time (credit cards, magnetic strips, paypal, etc. vs how old is bitcoin?).  What else is there?
I've read a few of your posts, and you're clearly not an idiot.  I'm a bit of a loss to explain your complete blind-spot on this subject.  Perhaps you really should read more about it?

Let's talk about gold.  Because ya see gold is a purely speculative commodity, judging from the amount that has ever been mined, and the amount that is still available for purchase, in either jewelry or just plain gold bars.  The amount that it is used in industry is miniscule, and the reason people use it as jewelry... wait for it... is because of its speculative value.


True... that's why there's mining.  Both gold and bitcoin.  Both cost money, both give reward.


You don't know how derivatives work, do you?

Actually, there are lots of choices.  You should stop thinking you're the expert on how other people will use this technology.  From what I've seen here, you're not really much of an expert on this at all.


No, they need the things that money or bitcoin buys... like food.  No-one 'needs money'.  They need the things that money can get, whether that is us dollars, chinese yuan, or bitcoin.  I mean seriously... does this really need to be explained?


Five years since the technology was even invented.  It took almost 20 years from arpanet to the internet as we know it.  It took five years for paypal to even turn a profit, and even after five years it was only with 50 or so million in speculative money.  It took over 10 years from magnetic strips to credit cards.  I remember using the internet in the mid 80's... If we used your current attitude, you'd would have been saying "This can't possibly succeed... where's the killer app?"
You only see this through the lens of your limited understanding, and use already debunked critiques, as if they haven't already been addressed.  Watch it... in one weeks time, you'll start squawking about 75% drops again, and completely ignore the 75% drop in oil in a shorter time, just five years ago.

@_date: 2014-10-14 22:45:44


No.  Not right.  Nice attempt at a straw-man argument though.
Let's say I want to make an online purchase... Do you automatically have a credit card?  No.  You don't.  You have to apply for one from a shady credit company.  Or you give your bank account details to a shady internet company.  And it's slower.  And it's more intrusive, because you get your credit history examined.  Simply to make an online purchase.  Which is a lot harder than creating an account with a bitcoin exchange.  
This is when facts get in the way of your argument.
And if you weren't so butt-hurt for some reason, you'd be able to look at it objectively.

Hey, I love BIP32 wallets.  I use one of them in electrum.  But I also want to share a private key across multiple devices, and realistically, including using non BIP32 clients.  
I mean really... i'm talking about a personal wallet on my phone here.  I'm never going to have more than a couple of hundred dollars in it.  I want convenience, and am not really that interested in that level of security if it means I can't immediately use three or four different clients to spend from the same private key, if one of my wallet providers implements a change that narfles the app, and I can't access it immediately.  It's why I have several wallets on my phone, because this has happened on a few occasions.
For my hard storage, I use Armory. 
And if electrum took away functionality that I wanted because some other guy thought it was not purist enough, I'd just use a different wallet provider that gave me the functionality I want.

@_date: 2014-09-10 00:19:28
The issue, if it goes ahead, is the way that Australia calculates tax on bitcoin purchases.  It won't be an issue for you, but if your Oz person purchases bitcoin, they may have to pay GST on the purchase.  Coinjar hasn't implemented this yet, but they DO charge a 2% commission on the purchase of bitcoin.  It is still cheaper than paying international exchange rate fees, but it's there.  
So transferring money to Oz will be easy, and very cost effective.  It is slightly more expensive now to go the other way if you choose to use coinjar, but if the GST action gets applied, it will not be cost effective to do so.  In reality, this will probably just mean that this business will move off-shore, and you'll get a coinjar equivalent accepting Oz dollars overseas without the GST, but it'll be a pain.  It'll also have pretty negative effects on an Oz company with no real benefit, so there's some hope that it won't go ahead.
But for now?  It's still much more cost effective than using traditional methods.  Even if these other things go ahead, the cost will be on the 'buy-in', and only in Oz, so it won't affect money you've already put into the system.

Most bitcoin micro-payments systems work off of zero confirmation transactions.  It is up to the wallet to determine whether zero-confirmation transactions may be used for payments, so you can immediately spend from your change address if you wallet allows this.  Mycelium does.
It's not really difficult.  The amount of confirmations you are willing to accept as a merchant will depend on your appetite for risk.  I wouldn't be accepting a 100K purchase without all of the confirmations, but no-one is casually going to be spending that amount of money.  For a $3 purchase, zero works fine.  You have more to fear someone using a stolen credit card with that tap-n-go thing than that you have to fear of using bitcoin for micropayments.  
So tell me... how is that same risk in tap-n-go in credit cards not crashing the network?  The merchant loses that money you know.  All of the transactions, up to 90 days later, get reversed, and they're out of pocket.  90 days can allow for a pretty long chain of unconfirmed transactions.  Surely this means the system is a failure, and no-one is going to use it?

Yes, but the point was about the change over the space of 100 years, not the 10 available in that graph.
In 1914, gold was about USD$19 an ounce.  Right now it's about $1200.  So multiply that yen ratio by that one right there, and you get a very large one.

The ancient derivation of the word, being the definition of a log of wood, I don't need to remind you, doesn't have a context in the thing that you're trying to say.

I don't think you understand how inflation works.  If I wanted to have that type of return, I'd simply put it in a bank.
The expectation for bitcoin is that it will have 'capital growth' (and I use that term in quotes for a reason) greater than inflation, because inflation is under-stated.
But really?  The power of bitcoin is the near instantaneous transfer of value between two locations, without bank interchange fees, which are only abhorrent at local transactions (~3%/transaction) but are absolutely obscene when measured for international transactions (&gt;10%/transaction)
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:51:02
The issue (and it is actually an issue) is that the amount you need to record to satisfy the IRS criteria is the amount, in fiat, you paid, at the time of purchase.  Most wallets don't record this.  If large purchases are made, and the value of bitcoin changes significantly (as it does) this could radically affect the amount of money you declare in tax.
I'm discussing with a guy the development of a wallet that records this functionality.  It records the bitcoin value of a transaction, the amount in a selected fiat at the time of that purchase (or wallet filling), and the amount in fiat in a selected fiat at the time of viewing.  With export functionality, this should allow you to use this information for accounting purposes.

The mp3 is just a file.  It doesn't change, no matter how you play it.  You would need a different file for different compressions, as happens now.  Every MP3 has fields, some of which are customizable (artist, track, album, song name, etc.).  There's nothing stopping you adding other fields like 'public bitcoin address', which would allow people to send you bitcoin.
There are lots of ways that this could work.  The QRCode is only an image representation of the 'public bitcoin address'.  You don't even need the QRCode.  All that QRCode is doing is allowing some program to translate the image to the 'public bitcoin address', and using that.
You don't need to embed it.  You just need to include data in a field.

That is why many merchants that accept bitcoin have discounted prices.  It costs them less, because they don't get reversed charges.  It costs them less, and therefore, it costs you less.  Get rid of credit cards, and you get rid of that hidden tax that exists in all purchases made by credit cards.  That money isn't coming from no-where.  It's coming from you.

But for the consumer, this allows them to take as a given all purchases used on this card as a GST tax return, if used for purchasing items in Oz, because the GST was already paid on the purchase of the bitcoin.

Whenever people say 'investing' in bitcoin, I normally switch off.  Most people think that buying bitcoin is investing.  It isn't.  It's speculating.  
Investing is when you put money into something with the expectation of revenue growth.  You invest in businesses.  You speculate on capital markets.  The two are not the same.

Ah... bank account.  So now you're talking about INVESTING.  
So YOU are the one who "isn't getting it".
If we were talking about INVESTING, we would move entirely out of cash altogether, wouldn't we?  We'd move them out of cash and into something like... say... shares.  It's YOU who doesn't understand the difference between an investment and an asset (technically it's the difference between investment and speculation, but who's splitting hairs, eh?).  When you put money into a bank, you are investing in it.  You are letting them lend that money to other people so that they can grow businesses with it, and provide a 'return on investment'.  That return is paid back to you in the form of an interest rate.
If you wanted to put your bitcoin into a similar investment class, you would go to BTCJam.  So you can get your unused bitcoins (the asset) earning a return (on an investment).  You know... like a bank.
Can you feel that click in your head?  The 'oh shit, I'm a bit of a fuckin idiot' click?

My 160K a year is working fine thanks mate.  And the reason it's so expensive, is because most people, when they visit here, prefer to stay here, rather than the shit-hole they came from.  You'd probably be surprised at how many americans and british people that means.

Sadly, it has been forgotten the difference between speculation and investment.  Theoretically, if loans were restricted to people companies/businesses/people that had a potential growth in revenue, rather than the expectation of capital growth (i.e. houses), people could save for houses, because there would be no incentive to bid up prices.  The price of houses would only be a reflection on how much people could save, rather than how much they can borrow.  Now, who wins?  The bank.

Oh I agree.  But you're the one who brought up religion, the separation of church and state, and the middle-east.  I'm saying you haven't separated them at all, and that if you wanted a model in the separation of the two, you'd look at china and russia.  Perhaps you should look up what ['in god we trust']( and ['under god']( mean.
You're no better.  In fact, you won't elect someone who isn't a christian to your leadership.  The US destabilises other countries, many of which are far more democratic than yours (look at the example above), using murder and torture.  And you use religion as a justification for doing it.  Perhaps you should look at McCarthy too?

Actually, this is one of the only situations in which the GST ruling wouldn't have an effect.  You could reasonably claim every expense generated through this card as a GST tax exemption, if you paid GST on the bitcoins, from coinjar.
They haven't implemented it yet as far as I've seen, but when they do, this is a legitimate method of ensuring that you were not double taxed.
GST on bitcoin purchases is still going to be a bitcoin killer in this country though.

If the value of bitcoin goes up to $5000 per bitcoin, that would equate to 50c per transaction.  If your business is using it for $3 purchases (like coffee) that will equate to around 20% of the purchase price.

If you want to develop an escrow service (like ebay) that holds the cash until the delivery of the goods, be my guest.  Let's see if people pay for it.
In Australia, I would just go to the Victorian Consumer Affairs office if someone screwed me out of something, and they'd be shut down if they didn't provide an appropriate level of service.  Same as with cash.  And if they stole from me, I'd just go to the police.

Just inflation, no need to add the hyper.  He is making a couple of mistakes, but the main one is the existence of the reserve(s).  It is unsound money.
I'm not saying that banks won't exist, or continue to exist.  They've been around for centuries, starting in the guise of the gold-smiths.  But I expect that banks will become more aligned with hard assets, or aligned with revenue-growth investments, instead of relying upon fees for their income.
