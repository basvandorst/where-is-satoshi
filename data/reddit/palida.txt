but the front facing server is giving you the encryption code, it could trivially backdoor it if  it wanted to (or if it was compromised).

unless they rate limit it. they don't need to spam your inbox with every sign up attempt, they could silently drop them.

moral of the story is don't use TOR over unencrypted HTTP.
If you HTTPS and get a cert error, run away.

Neat! Thanks for responding.
* Encrypted private keys stored on our servers use AES-256 encryption (not final).
Any more details about this? While it's a respectable block cipher, there's so many wonderful ways to use it incorrectly and/or compromise the security via policy.

Are there any technical details available about your security measures? I couldn't find any on your site and security seems to be a focal point of your service.

uhhh, that has nothing to do with the security of your phone versus a world superpower.
that's an article on how it's easier to get malware into the android play store vs itunes app store.

How is this Google's fault? He clicked a link in an email and entered his Google credentials into a random non-Google domain. Google can't stop that.

indeed, they are quite legitimate.

wow. at one point i lost a roommate and was living in an apartment for $2500 a month on a salary 1/3rd of that (in nyc). i can't imagine needing an extra $200k in income for an extra $12k a year in expenses.

Ha! they're even too lazy to individually target people, they sent one email and bcc'd everyone.

ripple seems a lot nicer, not being bound by any currency, it takes full advantage of using a ~~blockchain for~~ ledger. much nicer overall than a "every token is 1usd" method.
i just wish ripple had less premine :/
edit: not a blockchain, just a ledger.

it's because he doesn't actually care about volatiliy, he wants people to pay 10x and he knows people will throw money at him for the novelty of paying with bitcoin.

just reply to his comment, only he will be able to read it

sounds exactly like a phishing attempt, if it was legitimate Iwould assume you would give them the information needed via their website, not email it to a random address from someone claiming to be their lawyer.
