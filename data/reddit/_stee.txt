Oh cool that's awesome! And what do you mean by send change back to myself?
And do I search using my public key to see the balance for the wallet?

Thank you so much for helping just a couple more Q's. Which online wallet service would you recommend then? And what do you mean keep the whole blockchain? The blockchain of all your transactions?

Okay so from how if I understand correctly then, I only need to make a paper wallet once. I will give out the public key to people for people to send money to my wallet. This will be my cold storage because people will not be able to hack it on the computer or anything using the above method using the javascript generator on a new clean disconected from the internet linux partition to generate the public and private keys. Unless I physically lose the private key or stupidly give it out to people i am fine. Then I also have a second account like on my mobile using the app you recommended. This is like my spending money I have in my wallet and do not want to have a lot of since my phone could be stolen or something like that.
So how would I move the money from the paper wallet to to the mobile wallet and vice versa? 
Lastly, I should never have to change the address of my paper wallet unless I want to be more private about my identity since all block chains are public. Does everything I say make sense?
Edit: And how would I be able to see the current amount of coins I have in my paper wallet, do I need to manually keep track of that?

Thanks. Last question I promise lol! 
So I read somewhere that is unsafe to keep your public key the same after a transaction? Is this true. Do you need to change it after every transaction?
Also how do paper wallets work, it seems like those are the way to go to ensure safety. It is pretty much just you remembering your public and private keys yourself right? Does this mean you need to keep track of everything yourself. If you would like a new key would this mean you create a new wallet from your current private key and then make another public and private pair to form a new paper wallet. I assume this is what the people do who have the QR codes with them in public, that is just their public key correct?
Edit: Lastly, any guides you recommend me I read to get a better understanding?

I think I get this now! Thanks! So every transaction makes it so I send all my coins from A to B and I need to redirect where the change to go either back to A or C. 
Also where do you get your coins from just curious. And what is your public key. I owe you something small for all the help :D

The app says it gets rid of the private keys right away. But to be totally safe yeah I get what you are saying. Thanks a ton!

Alright check your recent transactions! :D

Okay cool thanks! But for example if I use the mobile app you showed me, one of the options is to transfer coins from cold storage; If I use the app I don't have to worry about change either than right?

So then you would recommend using local clients for holding wallets. Also it sounds like you recommend having a local wallet where a majority of my bitcoins are kepts while I have a smaller online wallet for spending. Is it possible to move coins between the two? Do I move the transactions by having two wallets and just making a transaction of one to the other?
Also why Electrum compared to others such as Bitcoin-Qt?

I'm probably going to use coin base so it will take a couple days to process. I'll comment here when it's done! :D
Also, how does the mobile app know what is in my account. Lets for example say you sent me 1$ worth of coins, would the mobile app then reflect that? And does the mobile app also deal with sending change back to the account for me?
