I bought $6000 worth of bitcoin when it hit 1925. Did I know it right then? I knew it was likely the last time in my life I'd ever seen bitcoin that low.

I fully live off of Bitcoin. All of my transactions are Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:07:20
You don't understand how bitcoin works. And that's ok. Bitcoin is a new money system (I say new, its 8+ yrs old) that rewards miners (They arent actually mining anything, they're using an odds system to determine who gets to scribe the next bunch of transactions) when they find a rare result in a math algorithm. This reward is what we use as currency. It is rare, it is limited. It can only be created when energy is used to find those rare hashes. Its like telling the government theyre allowed to print money forever, as long as they print a certain amount, and no more, while gradually decreasing the amount​ they are allowed to print. 
Oh, thats how we do it already you say? Ha. Your government can and will print as much money as they like. They wont be honest with you about it either. 
Now imagine you could force them to be truthful about it, and follow all of the rules. 
Welcome to bitcoin.

Actually, what you see there is coins maintaining their value. Those are btc trade pairs. Bitcoins value went up, while alts stayed close to the same. The amount of bitcoin you could get for those alts has went down, because bitcoins value is moving up.

Orly. Hop on an exchange and tell me how much usd/eur we have in buy orders. How many btc in sell orders? Just becaue I dont know the 'technical' analysis of btc, doesnt mean i cant see the co-relation of a high demand low supply market. Bitcoin was designed to do this.

Bounce bounce bounce. It'll settle down right under 5k until everyones really ready for it. Gunna edge right over 5k, and fly straight past it. I DO think that the 5k marker is an important one for bitcoin, and may cause it's own surge.

Thats the definition of a correction. Think of bitcoin as a very shy, very hot woman. She's gunna come on slow, you can tell you wanna fuck her. So can she. But why the fuck would she hop on your dick? She could, and will have the biggest she can find.

Youre in the dip right now. Buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:27:13
Well, since you're on reddit, I've got a question, since it seems industry standard. 
You charge a 0.0003 BTC withdraw fee, claiming it's for network fees. 
However, you process payments in batch, and I've personally seen sets of 20-30 withdraws sent out with a payment nowhere near 0.0003 per withdraw, instead, approx 2-3$ for the whole set. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:55:29
Apparently you do. Lel

I assume you made a total balance withdraw. Pax covered the fee until you next had coin. Which was with that trade.

It's a coin-hive monero miner. 
Yes, the sites shit. It's not supposed to be professional. It's designed to show the fact that anyone saying bitcoin is a bubble is full of shit. Considering if anyone really thought bitcoin was a bubble, they'd likely buy the domain from me, and setup some shorts income, ect. 
Problem is, thats not gunna happen. Theres aboslutely no basis to the statement : "Bitcoin is a bubble". Therefore, absolutely no basis for the site. 
Well, I suppose one might see that their ignorance to bitcoin caused me to run some stuff on their browser. Maybe, if they do some research, they'll see one of the many ways that bitcoin, and other other various cryptos can be used in the web. 
Something as simple as some hashes can be used to verify you're actually interacting with a human, vs a bot.

If they have an issue with me selling gift cards, they need to ban every single fucking vendor on pax who does. This was a selective ban. I dont fuck over my customers, I follow through on all of my orders.  read the fucking feedback eh? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:05:11
Free replacements, customers are given information about origin prior to purchase, and ive followed through. Gift cards were not carded, never revolked, and if the card balance was ever in question, a full replacement given. Paxful authorizes this type of activity. If it were in question, they need to contact the powerhouse of vendors that run their profits with sales just like mine.
