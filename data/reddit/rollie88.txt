But of course! Where there is turbulence lies great opportunity.

haha I highly doubt it but a man could wish.

You are right, but what would the rice hoarder accept in exchange for his/her rice? Gold will always be of value, more so now with the wider adoption of cryptos.

I also don't think we will see sub 1K BTC again in our lifetime, and unfortunately, we can't turn back time, so the best time to buy is now. If you believe in BTC's future that is.

And why would Goldman want to take over BTC or any crypto for that matter?

So does gold?

But you can still let him know that the upside potential is huge. Money trains don't wait for nobody. But there's always the next train to hop on to.

Buy low, sell high is a common misconception. There's nothing wrong with buying high or selling low. In those cases, you either sell higher or bought lower. 
If you are HODLing, you're going to have to practice some self-control and refrain from checking up on prices daily or even weekly. Because when you do, greed or panic gets in the way and that's where you can lose your pants.

You're going to have to determine what exactly your purpose for getting into this space is. Do you believe in cryptos as the future of fiat, thus looking at a long term HODL? Or are you just trying to get into trading to make some quick money or get into ICOs? 
Either way, I believe we're still very early on in the revolution against centralisation and fiat as a whole. Is BTC cheap per se? No. But is it still undervalue? Most likely. It probably wouldn't hurt to get into BTC now.
