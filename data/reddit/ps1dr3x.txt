Good points, thank you.
I think that things are getting a bit clearer now: the witness field in those cases should be the key factor in recognizing the tx type, I'll dig into it.
Regarding the different behavior of `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisig`, however, I'm still a bit perplexed. You are right on the fact that segwit does not permit uncompressed public keys so the methods should anyway fall back to legacy, but the strange thing is that all the four reported calls actually have an uncompressed key in the arguments (case 1: position 1, case 2: position 3), and also that, as a user of stackexchange pointed out ([ in the first case if you switch the position of the first public key from the position 1 to 3, you get the same results with both methods ��

afaik the order of the public keys is relevant in multisig transactions, so I think they cannot be sorted in different ways than the provided, but the point of my last comment is that maybe the fact that there's one uncompressed key is not the reason of that behavior... I really don't know ��‍

If I understood it correctly it makes no difference when you are going to redeem an output, so if you make a transaction to a segwit address or to the equivalent legacy address, in both cases the outputs should be redeemable using the same private key. The point is that if you need to represent a transaction you need to calculate two addresses (from/to), and there should be a difference in the two cases, because of the examples that I wrote and also because all the block explorers are indexing only one of the two address types per transaction.

Well, not at all, and this is the main problem: so many websites, articles, persons talking about Bitcoin and blockchains and blablabla, but actually the 99% of all the information are so repetitive, imprecise, high level and -totally- zero on the technical/implementation level

Yeah, you're right. I think I'll wait a bit more and maybe I'll try also there ;)
