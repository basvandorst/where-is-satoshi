gemini lol would be nice if they had more than 1 part time person that only works midnight to 1am on the third Saturday of the month verifying new accounts :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:10:51
About the same as random employees going through my personal info :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:08
Being stupid is pretty common here too
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:42:46
If only I could get verified in some reasonable amount of time.
Not sure why these exchanges don't hire temp employees to get through their backlog. Surely they're missing out on a ton of money by not getting people through the process and trading on their platform. If they wait too long I'll forget about them and go elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:08:23
I don't trust any one exchange with that much money at one time. I keep it spread out and only move into/out of gdax for trading to/from USD

0.1 bitcoin cash
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:52:36
Did I say any of that?
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:45:50


Uh a large number of people who have bought and held berkshire hathaway over the decades probably are. That is directly blindly following warren buffett's investment advice.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:45:52
Nope just continuing to make billions. Not relevant at all
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:52:21
Ok good for you then. You’re more likely to lose your private key than for FDIC not to pay out but to each their own
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:58:48
Why do you expect that they should. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:33:28
what are you smoking. how were high fees during heavy network use in any way manipulation
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:18:20
Man I’ve never heard that before. Always comes true too
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:38:11
I don’t think you actually understand how bitcoin and transaction fees work. It wasn’t out of no where. It was because there was an incredibly large number of transactions happening and paying a high fee was the only way to get your transaction out of the pool. Maybe learn how bitcoin works before you come out with tin foil hat conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:05:20
That’s not true at all actually. Ownmany people have lost their money from an fdic insured bank to date?
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:43:16
I didn’t say anything about other countries. My comment was directed towards USA banks as the posted image was of a US based company. 
If the FDIC is insolvent I can guarantee you the world will be on the brink of collapse and no one will give a shit about the 0.00001 bitcoin you own. This won’t be happening in the next decade
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:34:11
Right except feees were high because network usage was high. fees are low now because network usage is low. i wouldn't say low fees for that reason are a good thing....
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:13:33
I think Berkshire Hathaway’s performance would argue otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:52:38
This is retarded, childish, and a bit embarrassing for anyone involved in crypto. Grow up and stop fixating on buffet. Who fucking cares what he thinks. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:22:23
I didn't say that but i guarantee even with segwit fees will be high if bitcoin gets back to the # of transactoins it had in december/january. maybe not as high, but still high enough that it's not useful as a day to day currency
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:01:19
Which you don't even have to think about with a non\-joint account in the USA until you exceed $250k thanks to FDIC \(if you have a joint account, you're protected up to $500k\). I'm all for crypto but can we please stop making bullshit posts.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:12:13
You spam this all the fucking time. Please stop
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:55:09
The market cap of a cryptocurrency is not even remotely the same thing as the market cap of a publicly traded company so this comparison is completely pointless.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:06:38
Congratulations you win retard of the week
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:55:27
Point proven. You’re a retard. I have no idea why you fuckwads think that believing in cryptocurrency means you have to believe ridiculous shit like the FDIC is insolvent. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:40:50
Oh good another warren buffet post. I’m sure glad these are still happening
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:47:22
you only have to look at the average intelligence of the people on these subreddits... 
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:44:54
Correct but if the company is sold some day you as a shareholder will profit from that. With coins and tokens it’s completely unrelated to the companies value. You don’t really own anything. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 18:48:52
what? that doesn't answer my question. Why is there any expectation that any company involved in the cryptocurrency space should commit lines of code to bitcoin.... there's plenty of reasons to shit on coinbase, that's not one of them.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:13:34
Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:23:30
Don’t forget Wall Street bonuses. We should be seeing the effect of that any minute now finally!
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:09:06
Because the cryptocurrency world is full of people who act like children which is why it’s hard for people to take crypto seriously. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:29:03
At what point was there any doubt the FDIC would cover those banks. You’re saying money isn’t safe but provide no evidence that FDIC will fail. Banks will fail, absolutely. That’s not the point I made. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:25:23
CNBC goes full retard on a daily basis and not worth posting here
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:03:07
I’m not the one speculating on tin foil conspiracy theories with nothing to back them up. I’m stating fact as it stands today 
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:36:37
He didn’t “confirm” anything. He speculates just like everyone else. This is possibly one of the worst articles ever written which is quite the feat with the way crypto news is today. “Podcasts play an integral role in the world of cryptocurrency” lol wut
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:03:54
Who fucking cares
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:19:12
Maybe you should have made sure you understood what was required before paying money for it
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:41:38
Spoiler: there is none and everyone here is an idiot 
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:04:07
No... no it doesn’t actually. That’s called wishful thinking. Maybe this is the bottom maybe it’s not but what you said is stupid

This is Atlanta so probably die tryin
@_date: 2018-06-12 03:54:36
Why do people use these things. The fees are absurd?  You think the owners of these put them up to increase adoption? No it’s to rape you on fees and rates. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:17:05
the fact that you used the word normie means you have no friends and this image is a lie
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:16:25
yeah they aren't even remotely the same thing so why bother comparing them
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:05:12
Hey look a list of places I’ve never heard of and probably will never go to. Mass adoption boys!
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:05:51
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:21:44
I didn’t say wallets I said exchanges. If I have 1M in cash no one keeps me from moving it from the safe in my living room to the safe in my closet. It’s not the currency. BTC has the same limitations if you choose to store it on an exchange. You will face similar withdrawal limits and fees.
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:06:26
Found the guy with the tin foil hat on
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:26:35
I'll save you all the click. This is an advertisement for his web page disguised as an article that is garbage anyways

i can only buy some many mugs and t-shirts or candy bars at random grocery store in africa
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:55:06
Well thanks for ruining any chance we had at this being the start of something 
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:53:58
I’m all for blockchain technology but why in the world does a job posting board need to use it. Might as well throw in some machine learning/AI buzzwords while you’re at it
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:18:19
how is this any different than what crypto exchanges put limits on? It has nothing to do with fiat and btc and everything to do with the institution where you are choosing to store your assets at
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:22:04
What does this have to do with bull and bear markets. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:35:37
well i would wager most people aren't interested in an asset that can't gain in value so yeah
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:57:48
I mean I read the search warrant application:
I don't know the entire case but it sounds like he admitted he knew he was a money services business and had certain reporting requirements which he knew about but failed to complete. I'm not saying the law is good, but if there is a law, and he knew about it, and willingly did not follow it...... someone tell me what i'm missing here
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:47:34
The fun thing is that using bitcoin to pay for taxes is probably a taxable event itself :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:35:50
I’m assuming you only accept it when people are pre paying and wouldn’t accept it for someone paying on the spot? Or if you do how do you handle the time it can take to get confirmations. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:31:05
I was. It crashed then and it’s crashing now. Just because it recovers doesn’t mean it doesn’t crash. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:22:11
Coinbase adopting it will not drive us into a bull market. It’s wishful thinking 
It’s going to rain here tomorrow. Maybe that will turn this into a bull market too
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:39:07
that's... that's not true at all
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:38:15


 i would say the last few months disagree with you
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:44:46
Just saying not all things that go down come back up
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:57:13
so being at the entire trial, do they have a case for money laundering beyond the fact that he traded some bitcoin? I'm assuming they're trying to say he was using it as a way to launder drug money?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:51:59
It's been around bitcoin for a bit, it's just new to coinbase.
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:50:58
“I’ll also charge you if you want to give the ball to someone else
So.... just like bitcoin? :)
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:05:42
It might help sustain a run but I doubt coinbase adopting it will in itself cause a bull run
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:33:50
So what is he on trial for?
@_date: 2018-07-17 09:46:54
You don’t do percentages well....
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:15:58
I see so CNBC is shit when they talk bad about
bitcoin but this guy must be legit because he’s bullish lol. Make up your minds people. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:56:10
It’s easy to say words when you don’t back them up with anything. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:57:16
I don’t think you understand economics 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:36:00
I never said it was a get rich scheme but if you buy something with the intent to never sell and not use it, you might as well have set your money on fire because you’ll get the same value out of it. So surely there is a time to sell your bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:59:24
Oh another random crypto website with random articles with random price predictions.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:41:41
Uh i hate to break it to you, but you've always owed taxes on bitcoin, they just more explicitly laid out the rules.
I don't see bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) being used very much as a currency to purchase things until it stops being a taxable event to spend it. It's just too much work come tax time.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:07:06
Or you know become one of the richest people in the world....
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:01:11
enjoy your variable $10 transaction fees and 30+ minute wait at the register for confirmations to buy your morning coffee
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:12:05
He didn’t short it. I don’t think you know what shorting is
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:16:38
We’ll surely there is a time to sell or there was no point in buying it in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:29:12
Lol ok I’ll reiterate you’re an idiot. Go back to investing your $50 hoping it will moon
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:16:25
He has stockholders to answer to and I doubt they want him to throw a billion in crypto and watch it drop 50% in a month.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:57:57
Correct but surely a large percentage of this is people moving around bitcoin to and from exchanges for the purpose of trading. This in no way an indication of adoption as we don’t know the reason behind the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:53:24
This is the stupidest shit I’ve read all week. An open letter to Buffett. Really?
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:57:03
Probably correct which makes me wonder why I even consider investing in a coin that can never be used practically for a currency :).
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:39:12
Bitcoin is not the transactional currency of the future. There are better tokens for that than bitcoin. It may have uses but normal everyday purchases isn’t one of them. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:58:13
He’s made plenty of money since the dot com boom. You’re a moron.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:23:41
You imply he basically got lucky very early on. He continues to beat the stock market year after year which very few people can say they’ve done. He wasn’t just in right place at right time
