No fees, but they usually are not the most competitive. However coinbase is at £3630 and bittylicous is at 3520 so they are actually cheaper there right now. They do quick bank transfers and I have had coins from them within 10 minutes.

Apologies, could you explain what you mean by creating a new folder/wallet? I have placed the data in the %appdata% folder into a truecrypt drive and created a shortcut as above but if I delete the original %appdata% folder bitcoin will not run, so how am I more secure?

Hodl is a mistyped hold from a forum post a few years ago. It has become a meme within the crypto community

I think people need to step back from the line and look at this as a possible compromise. Rather than dismissing it out of hand because the other side is the 'enemy'.
It might turn out to be unworkable or a ruse, or it might keep things together.

Bitcoin is not dogma. Let's allow all viewpoints a voice please.
