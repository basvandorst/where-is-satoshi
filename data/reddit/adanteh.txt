How did that guy on that student rally or so get more than the Ukrainian revolution? People donate to weird shit. But hey, as long as everyone sees how good bitcoin is and how friendly.. Right?... Right?!

Not that it matters because he's not in charge anymore.

Brainwashed that Denmark is doing pretty good you mean? Sure, it's not perfect, but if you ask me it's looking pretty decent.. But don't mind me, I'm just someone from the brainwashed younger generation.

Haha. Death threats to your family not taken seriously? Sure, they are usually false threats, but do you really think something like that has no effect on people? From what I understand a lot of famous people don't really read anything that's been said about them, because most of it isn't anything you'd want to read

Because $400,000 is a whole lot for a bank or government, right? One thing that does annoy me on this subreddit is that so many people think that the bitcoin infrastructure is already massive. Yes, it's shaping up nicely, but the budget needed to take it down is not all that high for some groups.

So my ISP called and they wanted to sell me a mining rig or something. They were saying it generates 100 megabit per second. Is that any good?

I really hope they at least use the generated heat properly. Heck, quite some time ago I saw this dude who used the heat to dehydrate fruit. It's a start.

Are you saying that does a lot of cherry picking? Anything negative gets put off as "They don't know what they are talking about". Anything positive is more like "Good coverage!" Overall the popular news here is as biased as the mainstream media, it's just looking at it from a different perspective

Really this. A lot of these so called privacy browser for some reason all share the same terrible UI choices. It's not pretty, it's not intuitive, it doesn't scale well (I use 4k and the address bar only covers a tiny section) and not even the ad block is all that great.

How is Moneybookers when it comes to bitcoin though? At least they allow gambling stuff and I have a credit card from them as well, just a shame way less sites use moneybookers / skrill

I have a device that i need to put my debit card in, type my pincode and then it shows a number I can log on with. To send money I need to enter a number shown on the payment page in the device and the return number I get is to fulfill payment. :)

The same said about people in April. 253? Are you crazy?! I'll admit it's not the smartest move, but plenty of money to be made still. It'll just take them considerable longer and I'm guessing they were just out to make some quick money.

Compared to which part of the US? Most US citizens are way way poorer then your average citizen in Denmark. Sure, the standard of living might be lower compared to higher middle-class US, but on average I'd say your way better off. (Spoiler: The average might be decent. The distribution not so much. Most Americans are poor as fuck)
@_date: 2013-07-13 15:12:28
I do.

This.... Its just that Bitstamp has used Cloudfare for quite some time now, so the 24 hour thing you mentioned doesn't make a lot of sense.
Lots of sites that use CloudFare still go down plenty of times.

Doing groceries? No, because I have euro's and pay those in euro's plus they don't differ a lot depending on dollar prices for me anyway. If I search for things online? Yes, I do. When I see that something might cost X USD I don't mind knowing how much that actually is in Euros for me.
