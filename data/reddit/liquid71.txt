I don't need those resources, are you kidding me? Storing bitcoin is as easy as storing a password to any website. 
It's silly to argue that giving up control of your own money to someone else is more secure than you being responsible for your own money. You don't need mega security, or special technical skills unless you are running a commercial business. It's worth taking the time to get used to using a regular wallet and backing up your private keys. Start with small amounts until you feel comfortable. It's really not hard and besides being secure you'll be your own bank ;)

yes so you should insult him and tell him not to live on Bitcoin because he doesn't live within the same imaginary boarder as you do and bitcoin only works well within those imaginary boarders. You're a nationalist, I think you should stick to fiat. If you aren't lying and live on bitcoin I suspect it's because you're 14 years old and can't open a bank account yet. Now go wave a flag and start a war in the name of nationalism

@_date: 2016-08-09 20:25:21
I was talking about the company being worth zero to current ownership NOT the buyer. The company is insolvent so assets basically belong to the creditors now not the current ownership, making them worth ZERO to the current ownership. The "arguement" was neither irrational nor emotional (I have no horse in this race, I don't store funds on exchanges, Bitcoin be your own bank!) 
If current ownership which is insolvent has a buyer that can compensate victims 100% but is holding out for a better deal for themselves that is irrational.

Not sure why that's good news. I don't care what people spend their personal money on or where they spend it, I just want them to use Bitcoin. Free Trade.

Just the $50, the site tells you the exact amount of Bitcoin to send when you checkout, and the price, or amount of Bitcoin you need to send is good for a certain amount of time like an hour ( depends on the site, it should say how long you have to send payment when you checkout and they give you the address to send payment to) this is to account for changes in the exchange rate if you don't send payment within the timeframe.

NO they don't, source: I have a financial advisor and brokerage accounts :)
Big Mega Power is a bitcoin miner in Washington State, not a cloud miner selling anything to anyone they just mine bitcoins for themselves. Coinbase wanted them to declare how much hashrate they have, and to show proof of their hashrate in order to use coinbase services. That's akin to asking a business to declare their inventory, and to prove they have the inventory before opening a bank account. Doesn't happen, but it did at coinbase. I don't know the article but it was on coindesk about a year ago.
They are going above and beyond KYC to keep regulators happy, at least I hope that's the only reason.

They reopened because they profited off the hack. They lost 18% of assets in hack, give everyone 36% haircut and issue BFX shitcoins. Profit 18% which is worth the risk of reopening despite the fact they were insolvent. And since there is no information released by them you can't prove that my statement is wrong. 
Without transparency by finex it's just silly to "invest" in BFX or trust them. 
This is my opinion and I have lost no money in the hack. I think it's naive at best to blindly trust them without any transparency.

lots of hubris, but welcoming an attack on encryption by those who enforce the law is misguided at best. If they outlaw it's use like the proposal to ban end to end encryption in the EU then mainstream products will stop using it. If it's not used, it's strength really doesn't matter. Yes the minority will care enough or have the ability to protect their own communications from mass surveillance, but governments are the one entity that can prevent the use of encryption by the majority. So I would rather say fuck the FBI than thank you.

It's basically a bank, you need KYC and all that good stuff like you do with a bank. It won't work for the unbanked. And it's a method for transporting fiat, which is a corrupt money system controlled by corrupt politicians and bankers. No i'm not a tinfoil hat guy, just saying one of the attractions of crypto currencies is knowing the distribution rate, and everyone who uses it is doing so voluntarily. Nobody is having their life savings destroyed with hyperinflation because a politician decides to print money. 
Ripple is a novel idea and has purposes, but as an investment I think it's really horrible, the supply is controlled by a single entity and I doubt the demand will ever exceed current supply. It might be cool to use for some things, if banks and their puppet regulators don't completely destroy it with regulation it could become a better version of paypal. Even if they did though, the ripple coin would still be a bad investment. It's not even a coin or currency, it's a vehicle to transfer a currency like the dollar.

No problem being new we're all new at one time or another. Tip, don't keep cons on exchanges so when shit like this happens you don't get hurt. Only keep what you trade then withdraw, even coinbase with their "wallet" service don't trust it, do your trade and keep your coins on a hard wallet. The bittrex news is bad since they won't respond, just another example why you need to control your own coins, they are cash, don't trust anyone with your coins. Welcome to Bitcoin!

If you have bills that you can pay with credit card bitpay debit card is fastest way to get fiat for bitcoin but for rent and bigger bills like that an exchange still your best bet.

He obviously overstates miners power but how often does mainstream media get anything about Bitcoin right so hard to flaw him on that.

Jihan and Roger have the money to keep mined Bitcoins and eventually sell the high fees the are collecting at $10k a coin once they allow Segwit. hell just the leveraged trades they can make before they announce Segwit will more than make up for the current artificially suppressed price. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:23:59
Not happy about it but I'm pretty sure if there is a split exchanges will list both since it's more trading, which equals more fees. Or Coinbase ignores BIP148 and goes out of business as it's customers lose their coins on the winning chain lol. Best advice keep coins off exchanges on Aug 1 keep them in a hard wallet like Trezor or Ledger or any wallet you have the private key so you don't have to rely on the exchange making the right choice.

I understand the benefits, I'm just not worried about the regulators since it's not the only, or even the best way to invest in Bitcoin. For me it would be nice to be able to have some in a retirement account like an IRA for tax free investment but you lose a lot of benefit of Bitcoin when your investment is actually through a third party. 
Still when it comes to the SEC or any other alphabet agency I expect them to get things wrong and make things worse. If they actually did something right that would be newsworthy IMO
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:02:30
They are separate coins, you get the china BCC clone free so your costs are zero so sale is 100% if sold for fiat.  
If you trade directly for BTC not touching fiat you may avoid taxes, since you are just adding to your BTC position. When you sell your BTC the extra BTC you accumulated would have a cost basis of zero. The day you traded the clone coins for the real Bitcoin is the day you got it, so as for short term long term capital gains it would start from the day you made the trade accumulating ownership of the new BTC with zero costs. 
So to simplify sell for fiat your cost basis is zero 100% gain, trade directly for BTC when you sell the BTC that extra BTC cost you zero and the day of the trade for real Bitcoin not the day of the fork is the day you took ownership of the extra Bitcoin for tax purposes.

Take some time reading through the Trezor website.  If you want to use a machine for nothing but Bitcoin I'd advise using Armory which is the best software wallet, I used it for years never lost a coin. I only switched for convenience and so I could store some alts.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the hard work you and the other core devs put in. Despite the chorus of trolls complaining that it's taking too long, there are those of us that appreciate the care taken in reviewing code for bugs before releasing it. The DAO was minuscule in comparison to the money at stake with Bitcoin, and while some might complain change doesn't happen fast enough the silent majority appreciates that when change happens it's thoroughly vetted. Thanks!

Every invesrtment the earliest investors benefit the most. They also take the largest risk. It's called risk reward not ponzi.

Trezor has a fix for the "lead pipe" attack. You can have a hidden wallet keeping most of your coins safe if you are physically being forced to unlock your device. I didn't set it up but look on their website, not hundred percent sure it's called lead pipe attack but something along those lines.

Yeah they are just screwing their creditors. They claimed the cost to mine a Bitcoin was $480, they would have shutdown their operation last September when the price was under $300 if that was the case. They just have too much debt and using bankruptcy as a tool not because they can't make money anymore.
