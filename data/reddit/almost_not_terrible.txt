Society has never previously had a choice between:
* A currency or commodity that can be minted/mined pretty much at will
* A currency or commodity that has a provably limited availabilty
So my comment "Society has never had the choice before" was in agreement that fiat can be "grown" (i.e. devalued), but pointing out that, in Bitcoin, now we have one that cannot be "grown/devalued".

I love this, but I would want the option to show an approximate translation into a currency of my choice while making a transaction.

Fuck yeah - tax wealth, not income.
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:56:41
Imagine... 
A wealth tax could be an annual 0.1% on assets that you own.  You have £10k in savings in an overseas tax haven? You would pay £10 to the UK government each year because you lived here and were legally required to declare it.
An income tax could be 10% on money that you bring in during the year.  You earned £20k last year? You would pay £2K.
A profits tax could be 20% of the money you make during the year *minus* any that you spend.  Splurged last year and ate into your savings? You pay nothing.
Sounds amazing, right? If you were personally taxed like that, it would be great!
So my proposal is to tax companies that way... 
Companies must currently declare their income, outgoings, profits and wealth, but are currently only (really) taxed on their profits.
So guess what - to avoid paying tax, they inflate their outgoings to make it seem that they are much, much poorer than they really are and are somehow "just scraping by".
Let's say you are a company like Google UK - they bring in billions of dollars a year in the UK so must make it look like they have huge outgoings (they really, really don't). So they pay an overseas company huge amounts of money on things like "permission to use the Google logo".
Where are these overseas companies? In offshore tax havens where the rate of profit tax is basically 0%.
So a wealth tax would tax the company and parent company(ies) of any company operating in the UK (say) 0.1% of wealth and that would bring in billions of dollars of much needed tax revenue.  It's a redistribution of wealth because the money was taken out of the UK economy is just sitting in an offshore hole being unused at present.  It may as well be in circulation.
"OH but we operate in hundreds of countries" whines Google.  Suck it up Google - even if you operated in 100 countries, each of which charged 0.1% wealth tax (they wouldn't as Google would just choose not to operate where the rate was too high, so individual, smaller countries would just charge much less) that's only 10% of overall wealth each year.
Don't get me wrong. Such a system would be highly problematic, but we need to do something.

It's maths.  It has a finite scarcity.  We know how fast it will be mined, we know how many there will be in total. Like the speed of light, it's not changing in value.
My point is, Bitcoin is static.  We have historically undervalued it (and still massively undervalue it, perhaps by a factor of 10,000), but that's an issue of our perception, not the intrinsic value.
Now, granted, innovations like Lightning improve its utility, but really, that's the value of Lightning, not Bitcoin.

I haven't stepped into a bank in over a decade.
Nor has anyone under 30, except to open the account, apply for a mortgage/loan or because its the nearest ATM.
Cash itself is used for a pitiful percentage of transactions, so who will walk into a bank when all transactions are in crypto?
People applying for a mortgage, that's who.  Banks will become mortgage companies.

It's a prediction, not a design!  I expect they will hedge their bets and accept more than one crypto, which (let's be honest) is good design anyway - same as Amazon will accept different currencies).
Also, I said that one would fail ;)
Anything I predicted that seems off?
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:45:58
Not any more. Bitcoin is now stable, same as gold is stable.  It is currently a store of value, until I can be paid in Bitcoin and I can pay my taxes in Bitcoin, it's just a savings account.
It's the other currencies that are subject to QE, decreasing their value every time a new dollar is created from thin air.
This is important: Bitcoin does not increase in value, fiat decreases.
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:23:37
No, we don't. We just want our wealth not to depreciate in value.
Bitcoin's value is static, just like gold's value is static.
Its the dollar (and now, inconvenient gold) that is losing value.

Agreed, but too slowly.
Until I can spend my Bitcoin at Walmart and Amazon, Bitcoin is just a savings account.
A damn good one, mind you, with a better rate of interest than the banks offer, but it's still just a value store.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:29:08
Offer to pay them in Bitcoin.  Their choice, no pressure.
As a business owner, I'd be happy to accept payment in Bitcoin if offered, others wouldn't.
Ultimately, though, the fiat user pay more in banking, transaction fees, etc. so may the best currency win!

It's value doesn't really change, same as the speed of light in a vacuum doesn't change.
I think it's value is simply underestimated / underappreciated (no pun intended), possibly by a factor of about 10,000.

Because they're scared to be the first to jump.
In reality, what will happen:
1. an upstart eBay killer ("Digg-bay") will emerge that ONLY uses Bitcoin and/or Etherium
2. They get the website, legalities, security etc. right
3. They develop a cult following here on 4. Everyone shouts "to the moon" because we're far too excitable
5. E-bay notices and thinks "Hmm.  Threat or opportunity?  Not sure.. ACQUIRE!"
6. E-bay replace the management who utterly fuck it up, everyone gets sad (rollercoaster down GIF)
7. Some other "Digg-bay" wannaba offers lifeboats (let's call it "Redd-bay")
8. Redd-bay is AWESOME
9. "Redd-bay" is acquired by Amazon, purely for their customer list.  As it turns out, they've have an AWS-powered, fully-working in-house system ready and waiting to go since 2017.

No doubt, banks (or their successors) will have to move to services mediated by Bitcoin.
Key amongst these services will be:
\- Loans
\- Mortgages
\- Insurance
\- Vendor certification/assurance.
Storing the private keys? - maybe there is some value in this if it comes with associated insurance.
"Oh noes, we lost your private keys and all the coins are gone.  Here - have a new wallet with new coins we kept in reserve.  Oh noes, we lost those too.  Here are USD to the equivalent value.  Please don't sue us."
