That's genius. Storing it in an outdated format where the thieves will have no floppy disk reader to access its contents.

Geez. How much was the transaction fee for 20 dollars worth of BTC?

You just flaunted your potential for holding what some might consider huge amounts of crypto nowadays, and make yourself a target for $5-wrench-attacks.
Don't make posts like these. Be careful.

Do the fees justify such a small transaction? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:47:27
But don't plaster your face over a post saying that you are a long-time HODLer. There's been kidnappings over bitcoin HODLers.
I'm just sharing a word of caution. No need for downvoting.

We're too jaded by scams and self-interest to be excited for new developments, sadly.

Well if they don't cooperate and return the money they probably won't be able to get any leniency from the judge and will be sentenced to the full extent of the law.

This is why you sell the rigged, broken fiat for cryptocurrency.

Thank god you sold off your btc off Mt. Gox (if you kept your coins there) before the hack, otherwise you wouldn't have gotten your $40 at all.

Wrong. 
Graph clearly shows Carlos Matos, therefore the hypothesis is, toxoplasmosis influences people to make poor life decisions and "invest" in pyramid schemes like BITCONNECTTTTT.

Yea. People have been kidnapped and tortured by bragging about their holdings before, especially in Russia.

It is, yes. A corsair case.

Yea coinbase has surprisingly incompetent service reps. Doubt their service staff are trained properly with regards to these issues or just too swamped with the volume of requests to give a fuck.
I do litecoin retrievals from time to time and it's completely do-able when you have control of your own wallet.
