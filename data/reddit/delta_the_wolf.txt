But probably the main difference is that BCH is more like the original BTC. Just look into it if you don't believe me. 
I guess the thing that's better about BTC is that it's more profitable.
If you only really care about money, then get Bitcoin. But if you actually care about making the world a better place, I would recommend looking into Ethereum (ETH)

So you're saying if I take out $10 of BX2 it will also take $10 out of BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:52:17
Wait why will BX2 crash?
