Time's up

I don't care if you call it half empty. I'm just interested in the bitcoin capacity of that bag.

So is it confirmed it was just a trump trap?

- Open any exchange
- Modify it with inspect element too so that a completed-order message appears
- Inspect-element edit your balance back to normal
- ???
- Profit!

I don't think you should blame bitcoin for this. You entered that 8x amount and that's exactly the amount that was sent.
The ATM could easily implement a way to detect the extra cash and either return the extra BTC (probably this would make more sense) or give the extra cash.
But it clearly isn't implemented.
You'd need to enter the return address beforehand so it's clear it's your address, just in case you sent from an exchange. Entering it would probably be uncomfortable. You'd need to show a QR address and the ATM would need to have a scanner for example. At the moment clearly the easiest way for the ATM, instead of the better option for the customer, is being used. Hopefully that will change with time.
Did you bother contacting support?

How many bitcoins are there in the bag? It looks half full.
@_date: 2019-07-20 02:05:00
What? The browser with inspect element?
@_date: 2019-07-20 02:07:22
Sure you did! ����

But he didn't hodl! He spent at least a part on a Tesla.
Well spent though.

Not exactly. That was while on beta stage. Now the app was published on Google Play for the first time.

Deck Wallet has been updated to version Beta 0.2:
Any feedback is welcome (especially regarding security) before I publish it on Google Play.

I took this idea from several posts here and on BTCTalk. Not exactly the one you linked but probably another post of yours among others.
I like that idea of yours :) and I created this app to allow everyone to do it offline and without typing the seed anywhere. I found that idea to be a little vulnerable to malware because of that.

I know! But people even buy gold at stores! And that's more than $35 million for one ton!
If only one could buy less than 1 bitcoin or less than one ton.

The sarcasm was just to be funny. No harm intended.
I agree the price is very bad. The difference between buy and sell is way too high! Hopefully when there are more ATMs competition will force prices to get better.

Dynamic images have been added. Set a fixed price in USD and the image will show the equivalent value in bits, updated every 10 minutes.

It's running normally here. Make sure you have JS enabled as it uses jQuery. What browser are you using?

My bad.
