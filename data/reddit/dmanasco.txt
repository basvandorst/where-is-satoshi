its .0001 BTC /KB so a 1000 byte tx needs to have a .0001 fee or higher
Too low fee: We only provide accelerator services for those with at least 0.0001BTC/KB transaction fees;

plus ethereum seems to be gaining in percents quicker than BTC, i think sawpping to ETH is a sound idea
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:47:13
whats your tx id?
I may be able to help
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:04:48
Alright 
has been added to viaBTCs transaction accelerator
Have to wait for that one to confirm before we can submit second tx to viaBTC 
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:24:41
I don't know as I'm not that familiar with ledger. Where did the original tx come from? was it an exhange? they send a ton of btc out with very low fees. Havent seen that much unconfirmed btc in a while.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:27:16
yeah but he has another transaction that need to be confirmed before his final transaction can be confirmed. 
one of the output address has a balance that hasnt been confirmed. so that would need to be confirmed before the second tx could confirm. And Yes Transaction accelerators are nice. just used viaBTC and the same script to get my 120 Sat/Byte trans through.
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:01:32
Well I tried to get it in at midnight CST but the free tax limit was already reached. Will continue in the morning if it’s still stuck 
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:07:28
no this hour. my best time is 5pm or 6 pm central
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:08:48
I do have experience with Transaction accelerators, the viaBTC's tx accelerator has been good to me in the past. I have been able to get 3 50sat/byte transaction to go through using that service. You have to submit the tx right at the top of the hour, as they only allow 100 tx per hour and alot of people are using their service. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:50:19
Is way worse check out  
that is the address sending the low fee tx out. they have a ton of low fee tx that would need to be confirmed before you can even think about getting yours approved.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:43:55
the last tx has a high enough sat/byte where it should get confirmed quickly once the parent tx go through
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:45:59
First piece of the puzzle is now confirmed. Next have to push through the second tX. Will try and get it into viaBTC transaction accelerator in the next 15 min. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:34:54
Well it took some time but i finally got it confirmed through viaBTC's tx accelerator. It has 2 confirmations at this very moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:43:21
yeah premium is cost prohibitive in my opinion. the tx im trying to get through now, they want $130 for premium. id rather take my chances.
luckily for you you can open multiple browsers and all have them submit the parent transaction. since the parents don't have any unconfirmed inputs. run that script on each window. you will prob get a few into the queue the first time. just make sure you prefill the transaction id and the captcha before you run the script/
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:21:19
do i get anything for the other two transaction i had to get confirmed before you big tx could be confirmed?
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:39:54
you should have gotten a little pop up bar at the top that tells you if it went through or if the system was already bogged down. I know my greats time of success is the evening time. I have been pretty consistent about getting it in at 6pm central time
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:06:28
Yeah that is the final transaction but one of your base transactions has unconfirmed money and you can’t confirm your tx until all the base accounts are completely funded. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:43:56
going to need this one to confirm first
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:13:48
Use the code that is listed on this post. It has been very useful for getting the tx through.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:51:27
Going to try and get all three on viaBTC, we'll see how it goes
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:34:38


Ahh well the subreddit doesnt look good. tons of issues. unfortunatly, you may be stuck for now. hopefully they will confirm soon for ya.
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:37:42
i prefer 50 bit
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:21:45
i know the fee may be low but i have some good experience getting low fee tx's through. just need the transaction hash to see if i can help ya
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:06:46
I’ll DM ya the info 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:12:58
i dont trust those 5 dollar accelerators, most of them are just fronts and dont do anything. I have had good experience with  you have to submit it right on the top of the hour. minimum your looking at is 5 hours because the 5 tx i listed all have a sat/byte of 65 so all those will sit there until the mempool clears. this morning it was down to the 240 sat/byte range. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:00:45
the tx has a bunch of unconfirmed inputs, there is no way that tx is going through until
go through. all of those are super low sat/byte 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:02:51
what is the tx, no one can help without the tx id
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:47:21
You have to get that first tx unstuck, this can be done by waiting it out, or using a transaction accelerator. I have had good luck with  check out  for info on how to get the best chance of getting it accepted.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:00:59
no prob, sorry it took a min, was trying to get a tx through on the accelerator. lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:20:32
What is the bitcoin transaction fee. If you click on the transaction and then select more it should give you the bitcoin Trans id
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:42:39
how complex was the password? do you still have the wallet file?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:52
i know there are a load of address in that dump. I reccomend looking for ones that dont say reserve=1.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:21:13
Looks like you may have downloaded a compromised file tbh. Or the computer you used has a virus. 
That’s is the “address” where the money was sent. Looks like it was done with an OP_RETURN based on Blockchain.info tracker. There was another transaction to that address on 12-23-2017 for .44 BTC
Sadly I believe that .075 btc is lost forever :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:42:22
When did they delete the app? I do recommend making an unencrypted backup like someone mentioned here. It would all people to search for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:43
PM'd ya
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:20
do you have any python experience? pywallet seems like it can dump the wallet without having to go through bitcoin qt. The other thing you could do is load up the wallet file in bitcoin core and then go to help -&gt; debug window, then console, then type in dumpwallet "c:\Users\(your user account name)\wallet.txt"
the Quotations are very important. after the file dumps it should give you a text file that has a list of all your public address along with the private keys. then you can look up the address on blockchain.info to check balances
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:48:50
This is a good read on the why behind it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:59:18
download a bitcoin wallet application like electrum, then you should be able to open the wallet.dat file with it. Hopefully it inst encrypted. If it is good luck remembering the password.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:54
its in the current version of core. you may try downloading the latest core and after it is ran for the first time. replace the wallet.dat file with you wallet.dat file. then reload the program, minimize syncing the blockchain window. and then go through the steps i mentioned. Hopefully that will help
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:34
Well i do agree with their tweet. After the bcash debacle the other night, people were recommending to transfer small amounts of btc out of gdax to make them pay higher fees. Heck i bout some during the dip today and transfered it over to binance for trading and it cost coinbase .00225 btc to send my .005 btc. $27 to send $65 is outrageous. Its also the reason i havent moved from my wallet to binanace becuase the network is calling for .0225 fees right now. im not going to pay that to move .01 around. Need Segwit and Lightning Network ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:41:59
what version was the wallet file created on. Have you tried going through the git commits of the program and downloading an older version. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:35
Well thats great to hear. Yeah first column is private keys and the corresponding public address should be next to them. Hopefully you strike it rich. :) if you do remember me, i def take bitcoin for my help LOL
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:43
when did they disable withdrawls? Glad I got mine out a few hours ago.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:44
other thing is does your file have hdkeypath attrib? if it does i have noticed that the first one it generates is /0/0/0 then the next is /0/0/1 so on an so forth up to 0/1/1001 So checking all 2000 is not feasible. what you can do is import the text file into excel using the get external data from text, then you can select fixed with and it should break it all up into columns. then you can copy like 10 address at a time into electrum. At least that is how i would tackle the project
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:02
if you look at gdax (coinbases excahnge) you will notice the spread is there as well. you are basically setting a buy or sell order for that price. the more market saturation the lower the spread is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:33:39
alright well before you do anything else lets make sure you copy that wallet.dat file onto a usb stick. always want to have a backup incase something goes wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:43
any good news?
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:26:53
welcome, there are more but the rabbit hole goes too deep, Interestingly one of them is 3 months older than the other ones. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:08:06
The following accounts are all used by the scammer. You can tell because they all comment on the fake websites.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:10:09
and the fact that the first signed message was a headline from "The Times"
