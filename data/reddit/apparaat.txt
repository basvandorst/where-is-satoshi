Hey thanks very much! This is also my first ever video explaining a bit about the tech behind Bitcoin and so the amount of retakes I had to do was severely underestimated :p

Don't ask me how I know this, but here you go -

I'm the one responsible for managing this ATM and I must say that it's a very proud and happy moment!
I'll see if I have the time tomorrow to snap a few more pics and record a video. If I don't, then as soon as I have some media material I'll let you know.
Also, as I've found, the place where this Bitcoin ATM is housed in (Warie's Thai) just so happens to have the most delicious Thai food from all the Thai food restaurants and take-aways I've eaten in/from. If I'm not mistaken they had the privilege to be the first restaurant in Amsterdam (or perhaps even in NL?) to accept BTC, so if you find yourself in a hungry mood and wanting (to sell) BTC, then do take the time to explore their menu (with your mouth). I hardly ever get excited about restaurants but this is purely coming from the depths of my taste buds :)

Congratulations BTC-O-Matic on the first one-way ATM in Amsterdam!
We ourselves will be bringing the first 2-way BTC ATM in The Netherlands very soon :)

I think what OP meant was that Coindesk forgot to mention that it's the first 2-way Bitcoin ATM in NL. That's pretty monumental piece of information if you ask me.

Just curious, if Eternitywall disappears tomorrow, how would I find the messages back in the blockchain?

I remember sending them this support e-mail at the end of March with absolutely no response:






If anyone has any pointers regarding this then please let me know.

Just registered an account to post the following: I'm working on it already. I know an owner and he's pretty positive about accepting Bitcoin so far. The only considerations he's having are about the judicial uncertainties of Bitcoin in our country. That's definitely something to research about, so I've put that on my list.
Also I've promised him that I'll do some good PR for him, but you can't really go wrong with the first coffee shop in the Netherlands to accept Bitcoin :)
