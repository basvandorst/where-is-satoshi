"But if we don't sell, the price goes up, they lose money and we win."
no. price goes down anyway because Miners have a non-speculative reason to be bearish in the futures market.

this story is lit
i had a similar experience at bank of america, except when they said "i heard it's a scam" and I tried to explain otherwise they were like "nah it's still a scam"
maybe im bad at explaining...? but this was a few years ago

Very clearly, "The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer."
Ie "It depends"
Moreover it does not say virtual currency is not treated as currency. It specifies 'In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency' and indicates that wages paid with it (as in currency) are subject to (monetary) income tax. It also indicates:
"A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property."
You do not need to report an in-kind trade of, say, your car for another car. You do need to report major money transfers and sales tax (a tax on money).

Have you even read the IRS official advisory? It does not declare bitcoin is an investment. Instead, it says "it depends"

what about this: I buy in at 500, sell at 15k, buy back in at 14k (but I spend 15k, so now i got more than 1). Do I owe anything?

bitcoin price going up is a goal for me.
fixed supply, increasing demand means price goes up.
so no increase in price means we are failing to drive adoption: that should be considered a failure on the part of the community

by this logic bitcoin won't hit until the 2020s, not 2019.
Although I agree. We won't see the real power of mainstream bitcoin until 2020s.

I agree with OP but also: The Machinery of Freedom is not Austrian Economics and it is perhaps the most important book on the list.
Friedmanian anarcho-capitalism is robust because it doesn't require any moral argument to work: it's purely empirical.

I mean, that's what the article explains. tldr it is centrally administered by this guy Znort and he has gone absent; payouts aren't happening, and there are better other options for prediction markets and bets

buy low sell high is whack I have learned. Better is buy appreciating sell depreciating. It looks a bit like buy high sell higher.

Bitcoin essentially displaces a traditional role of government: Management of the money supply.
Anarcho-capitalism explores the possibility of entirely displacing government with the market.

Interesting to note the Coinbase all time chart we have never seen this pattern before. Where there is a sideways stagger and the second peak is higher.
