[Why the block size can't be adjusted automatically like the difficulty?](
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:22:09
I thought that this will be a better solution instead of bothering and changing the size "manually" (now it will be changed to 8Mb, then to 16Mb, then something will happen and it will be 10Mb, then...)
We don't have such problems with the difficulty.
I am asking "why it can't be" because I thought that the people who are coding the bitcoin and knows better the protocol, should asked this question already (seems obvious) and there is an explanation why this can't be done.
But if you say it can be, I will try to dig in further to find a solution.

To keep block size limit optimal for current network/transactions activity.
If the network is inactive, the limit should be decrease to prevent: 
    [0.2 Mb]-[0.1 Mb]-[7 Mb]-[0.3 Mb]-[0.x Mb]-...
if bitcoin becomes widespread and block limit is almost reached (like now), it should increase.
The increase/decrease should be done in a clever way, so the flood (intentional block size increase) to be unprofitable.

Nothing in Moldova :|

Thank you ;)
P.S. We will add new a new Gift Code every time the current one will be sold. So we will try every time to have one available.
*Note: Some times it will show "Out of Stock" but the code is still there. That can happen when someone pressed the "Buy" button, a BitPay invoice was created and is waiting for payment, if no payment is received the invoice will expire in 15 min and the code will be available for purchase again, so you can check again after 15 min.*
