+1. The [NuBits website]( is built on Drupal and we love it.

Hi We are building [B&amp;C Exchange]( a decentralized Bitcoin exchange. 
In contrast to other decentralized exchange projects, we have a couple notable features:
- Anyone can own cryptoequity in the project through "BlockShares". 
- Bitcoin dividends from exchange profits are returned through the protocol to BlockShareholders. It is done using the established and successful dividend mechanism from the Nu network. 
- B&amp;C will have liquidity operations in place at release to encourage trading activity.
- B&amp;C will be using NuBits as a cryptocurrency substitute for US Dollars, since a NBT has been worth $1.00 since Sept 2014. 
We're hopeful the Bitcoin community will embrace us as we get closer to launch. Centralized exchanges have robbed the Bitcoin community of momentum (and funds), and it's time to embrace more decentralized alternatives.

It's a good lesson that security should be the first concern of any entrepreneurial start-up in the Bitcoin space.

Centralized exchanges will be obsolete soon enough. Decentralized exchanges are the future.

Enthusiasm for Bitcoin has also been eroded by the constant thefts from centralized exchanges. Gox turned off a lot of users who might otherwise still be interested. It's time to start supporting decentralized exchange development.

[B&amp;C Exchange]( B&amp;C Exchange will be an open-source decentralized exchange that completes cryptocurrency trades between users by utilizing multisig signers that compete for blockchain rewards based on their effectiveness and honesty. Trades will occur using real cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, as opposed to artificial proxy cryptoassets like those found in NXT or BitShares.
On B&amp;C Exchange a web based interface that will be familiar to users of centralized cryptoasset exchanges will be offered. Unlike centralized exchange websites, exchange operators will have zero access to funds and zero responsibility for customer account information. If an exchange website disappears suddenly, a user can simply go to another site that uses the same open source exchange software, or use another application that supports B&amp;C Exchange and continue using the same account without interruption. This is because all account information will stored on the blockchain.
Equity ownership in B&amp;C Exchange will be held by users who own “BlockShares (BKS)”. Users will pay transaction fees on the exchange with “BlockCredits (BKC)”. You will not need to own BlockShares to use BlockCredits, and vice versa. Profits from the sale of BlockCredits will be returned to BlockShares holders through a Bitcoin dividend mechanism in the protocol.

Perhaps closer than you think. B&amp;C Exchange is a decentralized Bitcoin exchange in development and things are progressing well so far.

It's hard to dispute that [NuDroid]( (NuBits + Bitcoin) powered by ShapeShift is a superior mobile wallet to pure Bitcoin wallets. 
A user can keep their funds in stable USD NuBits, and have them automatically converted to Bitcoin at any Bitcoin point-of-sale. NuBits are stable, Bitcoin is convenient.
