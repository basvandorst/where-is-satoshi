It presents interesting Court challenges. How do you prove who stole it? You can't demand the BTC back. Can you sue for the value presently? When it was stolen? It's pretty neat.

It's in Hastings on Hudson NY. Right near the Hastings Metro North Station on Warburton Avenue. It's called Straub Auto Repairs. I figured the NYC BTC community would like to know he exists. Good service, been there for 47 years.

Thanks for the advice!

Update 6/1/2014: Everything is LIVE! The address is as follows:
Straub Auto Repairs
477 Warburton Avenue
Hastings NY, 10706
Feel free to come and get your car serviced and spend some BTC!!!

I don't see why not. I can lock up the device, and Coinbase has a "kiosk" mode where it locks things down.
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:07:48
Quick Update: Hope everyone is enjoying their weekends! I will be setting up the shop this Thursday, pending Coinbase's verification works. I'll be sure to keep updating here.
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:10:20
Knew it! As soon as you said Greek I knew. Chris is great over there!
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:19:35
Exactly. My Dad knows a bit because I've mined. Once I explained the no fee aspect, his ears perked up. Visa, MasterCard, AmEx all get around 4% fees. He was bewildered he could get USD for no fee. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:43:11
Also I should mention that we haven't officially set up yet! I'll post here when the system and things are "live". 
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:04:22
To be honest that was his main gripe. I was hesitant to post until the entire system was set up because I was worried people would flock there. He bet me he'd "never have a single Bitcoin customer." I'm currently setting up the tablet, and will be going there tomorrow to show his secretaries how to accept payment.
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:12:34
Thank you for the tip. Maybe. I don't see why he wouldn't consider it
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:53:39
I'll tell him to give the local newspapers a call. There's a bunch in lower Westchester for all the towns along the Hudson River. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:51:20
He was VERY against it because of the volatility. Once I eliminated that, things went from bumpy to smooth. Plus, not very many businesses want to hold BTC, they want cold hard cash. That's totally understandable. Luckily, in NYC there are plenty of bars and such willing to take my coins.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:19:47
Will do. Thanks for all the great suggestions! 
@_date: 2014-05-21 18:02:06
That's why I came here. It seems that is a pretty supportive group! I'm actually heading up from Queens now!
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:38:42
Nope. Italian, salt &amp; pepper hair. The shop is in Hastings. Getting him going was very easy with Coinbase.  thanks for the next step. Never posted on Reddit before, but I browse quite a bit. Still trying to get a website up too. 
Just in case anyone is wondering, it's Straub Auto Repairs, in Hastings on Hudson NY. 35-40 minutes from Manhattan.
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:54:20
Quick update: After going to the shop today to set things up, it turns out that Citibank doesn't have the ability to auto verify accounts. A bit of a bummer. We have to wait 3-4 days to do a deposit verification thru Coinbase. Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:41:06
Thank you for all the support. Hopefully those of us who live close enough will show him it was worth his while!

I just finished setting up the Coinbase point of sale and added the shop to Coin Map via Open Street Map. Can you make sure I didn't mess up?! The address is 477 Warburton Avenue Hastings on Hudson NY 10706
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:41:10
I've found that Coinbase is great way to get up &amp; going fast. Plus they offer the POS system. BitPay is nice for online retailers, but my Dad wanted access "fast!".
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:06:48
Well, my Dad's an auto repair shop, not a body shop :). However, I do know a trustworthy one in Westchester that my Dad sends business to!
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:53:35
I'll be doing a test run tomorrow, and I'll post back here once it's set up rather than creating a new post.
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:52:33
Thank you! I'll be setting them up tomorrow with a terminal to start accepting BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:56:47
Wait, did you go to Christ @ Overseas Auto to get your car door replaced?! He does auto body, not auto repair. He and my father are close friends! 
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:48:26
I understand. I'm in law school, so this entire thing is a very large legal grey area. The instantaneous transfer to a check account should help. I just need to get things settled on the website front too. He went from the Stone Age to the Modern Age very quickly.
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:42:27
Instantaneous set up. Used his email to create a wallet, set up the checking account &amp; instant conversion to USD, and gave him an old Samsung Galaxy Tab to use as a POS. Done and done. We have yet to advertise, because I have to get up to Westchester to test it first. I live in Queens at the moment.
