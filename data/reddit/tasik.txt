Not sure I see why you have to be rude.

... I don't agree. You are doing exactly what I'm talking about. Trying to make the victim at fault. Leaving your door open would be like sharing your password on websites. 
Most hackers are running brute force programs looking for open ports and default passwords. They are scoping out potential targets. They aren't just someone passing by who happened to notice a computer that could be hacked. They are out to hack. Literally trying as many "houses" as possible until they hit one that works.

Ugh... Mornings. Too. Early. 
I read that as ALL coins stolen, not none. I retract. There is nothing wrong with this thread, I'm just an idiot.

Protection is a development issue right now. The software needs to improve. 
Telling people they are the reason they lost their money (While true in the sense that it *could* have been prevented) scares others away. Most people don't wanna get involved with something that requires 5 to 10 extra steps to "secure" their property. 
Telling peoples its their fault protects less people than it scares away. If we keep pretending the situation is fine by blaming people than it'll allows us to ignore better solutions. 
So realistic or not. Its not helping.

I know you're making a joke and OP seems to in good spirits. But I would be quite annoyed if it was my coins missing. Your computer is not the same as the sidewalk. Having an unencrypted wallet on a computer is much more analogous to leaving your front door unlocked.
You don't deserve to have your shit stolen just for leaving a door unlocked.
Its sad that here in we make victims feel like idiots. The truth is internet security is a very confusing, unfriendly topic for the vast majority of people. Hackers are a problem, they are damaging the value of our currency. Its an issue we can't try to ignore just by blaming victims. I feel it would be beneficial if we at least try to have some empathy. These people, even the ones being hacked, should still be our friends.

Why is everyone so sleepy!?

But my point is we want this idea of Bitcoins to be adaptive and friendly.
We can't be attacking the victims of thief with bold letters of accusation and blame. 
If want people, ultimately everyone if possible, to adopt this as a real currency we have to acknowledge that the industry needs to improve. People need to be comfortable. The systems in places are not yet intuitive enough for everyone and our currency will not evolve unless we admit that the security needs to improve. Not the people using it. 
You shouldn't have to be a tech to feel safe with Bitcoins. And you shouldn't be made to feel ashamed if you lose them to a thief. If we keep blaming victims we are ignoring the problems and thus enabling the thieves. Its a backwards attitude and it needs to change. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:09:25
This attitude is degrading our community. 
It doesn't matter whether or not they were surprised. Its not good that we put more effort on blame than on solutions.

That is inconsistent with your example and wrong. 
The "total worth" is a purely hypothedical concept and is definitely not equal to the money "put in". 
"Put in" is also the wrong way of thinking about it. No one is putting money into Bitcoin. There is no holding of funds that back the value of Bitcoin.
Think about this. If I sell a Bitcoin to you for $1000 then you sell it to me for $1500. How much have we "put into" Bitcoin?
Is it $2500 because that is the sum of what we both paid?
Is it $1500 because that was the price of the last transaction? 
Is it $500 because that is the difference in value / what you've gained?
All are wrong. It's $0. 
Our transaction has had no effect on what other people are willing to pay for our Bitcoin. You having an extra $500 is nearly meaningless. 
If I tried to sell that Bitcoin again tomorrow and no one was willing to buy it. It's worth $0. I can't force someone to pay me $500 because you made $500 off of it yesterday. 
If that was the only Bitcoin in the world the total worth is now effectively $0. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:28:45
That's not how it works either though. 
The value is not exactly equal to the amount "put in". The value is whatever someone is willing to pay.

This is hindsight, not an investing strategy...
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:43
No. That's not the translation. The worth of Bitcoin is not the sum of all the money invested in Bitcoin. There is no pool of funds that determine the worth of a given coin. 
The worth is quite literally whatever people are willing to pay. 
An extreme and unlikely example.
Let's say the US Government decided to make Bitcoin full on illegal. This could and probably would scare a dramatic amount of potential buyers. The worth could easily drop by 50% without anyone selling, just because people are now unwilling to pay for the risk. No one has to sell any coins for the value to be impacted. 
The opposite is true too. It is entirely possible, hypothetically, to sell a coin for a million and not have any effect on the value of other coins.

Thank you :)
