Forget about the parasitic self righteous pricks crawling on this forum. If you didn't find an answer by this time I'll suggest this one: Cex.io
- Accepts credit card, even if it's a virtual one and I can assure you this is rare.
- Has high limits, not sure how much, but I was able to buy 1000$ (US) worth of bitcoin with a credit card
- The verification process requires some documents and photos but it's pretty straight forward.
However at the moment I am writing this response to you they are not accepting new accounts. You'll ahve to wait a bit, if you are still interested of course.
Good luck on your investments and your life.

My limit on Coinbase is 1/3 of that aprox. but it says this limit will be higher in 40 days. Is it 1k after that time or do you need anything else to have it that high?

Yes, Cex.io seems like a good place to buy.
If someone is looking for the an exchange that accepts payments with the characteristics I described, Cex.io is definitely the best. I was able to sign up, verify all my identity documents (without videocall bullshit, i.e IDnow), submit credit card (no Simplex bullshit), buy bitoins and send them to another exchange, all this in an hour or two.  
The fee is 3,9 % + 0,20 EUR, and an additional 1,7 % if you convert currency.
Thank you all for your suggestions.

Yeah, I know, they were my first choice but Simplex doesn't accept virtual cards which are way more secure for buyers and much less of a hassle. Too bad for them.

If I understand well, Bitpay only accepts credit card to buy their own card, which takes several days to arrive. It doesn't allow you to buy Bitcoin with credit card directly.
