Why would you use shapeshift? Just transfer it all out using gdax's withdrawal to wallet function.

Buy bitcoin? I'm sorry; this is a currency. You GET bitcoin by offering goods or services in exchange for bitcoin. Just like any form of currency. It's not just something you 'buy'. "Buying" bitcoin with another currency is just a currency exchange / conversion.
Bitcoin will not be able to continue to thrive if people keep treating it as a thing that must be bought with a fiat currency then converted back into a fiat currency. It needs to stand on it's own. If it's value is dedicated by the value of a fiat currency conversion rate then it is no better than those.

Traditional payment methods aren't really that great at age verification either. Minors can gain access to parents cards or get pre-paid debit cards.
We do everything we reasonably can to minimize underage consumers on the service, but after that, it's up to personal responsibility for consumers, ie the parents.
We offer crypto as a means for our customers who might not believe in traditional payment methods such as credit cards. We have a nice percentage of users who do not like using big banks, so we offer crypto as that solution.

That's a funny way to spell Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:06:39
Never said Coinbase is better managed than Bitpay. He said Bitpay is a terribly ran business which I disagree with because we've been using them for four years after Coinbase dropped us without warning because they bow down to their credit card processing overlords.

They have their own issues. Like the fact that if your company sells 18+ content they lock your account down. We had a large number of funds stuck in our account a few years back when they locked us out without warning.

They can use BTC, PayPal, Google Wallet, fucking birds with money strapped to them. Won't stop the inevitable lawsuit from manga publishers.

Make sure you have two-step authentication enabled on your Robinhood account.
@_date: 2019-11-05 03:07:36
It's not even an online wallet. Robinhood doesn't allow the user to access their wallets, they can only buy and sell, no transfers to other wallets. OP is using BTC purely as an investment asset for more USD as the end result.
@_date: 2019-11-05 03:04:52
They're looking at it from a different viewpoint than you. The majority of the bitcoin community looks at bitcoin as a new form of currency to eventually replace fiat currency. Hardware wallets are essentially your own personal bank, you transfer little bits of BTC out of your hardware wallet onto mobile wallets for daily usage.
Whereas you are looking at it as a market asset/investment to get more USD as the end result.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:50:58
Sadly they're not able to withdrawl any of the BTC they bought via Robinhood. Robinhood does not support withdrawls on any crypto assets.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:54:55


Ouch. If you're serious about long-term cryptocurrency, or actually believe in bitcoin as a currency, rather than a market asset for USD, then I'd recommend selling off your Robinhood BTC the next time it spikes then re-invest it into actual BTC and store it on a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano.
Who knows if Robinhood will ever actually add the ability to withdrawal BTC from their service. Their knowledgebase regarding that ability doesn't give a very good outlook on that functionality. So they're no guarantee that you have any real BTC through them at all.

Still better than Coinbase at least.
@_date: 2019-04-28 10:58:23
That's not what he's getting at. Coinbase has done some shady shit in the past. My work had an issue with them a few years back where they locked our account with over 15 BTC in it because we sold hentai comics / adult content. Coinbase's major issue, much like bitpay now, is that as soon as they got involved with credit cards and banking, they basically got bitch slapped with what they can and cannot support. It's not open by any means. It's very controlled and very restricted.

Thank you lol. I was coming here to post the exact same thing. Amazon is extremely popular in Japan. The only time the __ of ___ works is if said first thing is not as popular as the thing in that country. Like Baidu is the Google of China. That works cuz Google isnt as popular there.

I bought 1 ETH back when it was like $8 not thinking it go anywhere tbh. Just buy in at the highest amount you're willing to lose.

Specifically only Coinbase. It'll pull funds out of ur coinbase for the rebill, if it doesn't have funds it'll throw an error. after 3 errors it then cancels automatically / pauses it.
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:41:16
Coinbase has a recurring billing option though o.O we use it at

Isn't the US dollar used more than crypto in terms of funding terrorism and drug trafficking?
