Unconfirmed reports that [this is the wallet with the stolen BTC]( Can any blockchain analysts here verify that?

Why so vague? That amount is different for everyone. You sound like a load of bullshit to me.

What a strange thing to do on your cake day... I thought you're supposed to get stuff today, not give it away. Anyways, happy cake day!

Wow. This is pretty much the nail in the coffin. I'm done with coinbase. They have constant issues with balances and take unreasonably long to get you your bitcoins, exposing you to major currency risk. All the while, they go about randomly canceling orders citing "high risk" on accounts that have purchased hundreds of dollars of bitcoins previously. I have a coin that was supposed to have arrived Thursday, April 2nd at 7pm PST and its yet to appear in my account. They don't even send them as advertised. 
Look, I get every company has growing pains. But they're just full of greed, working expeditiously to broaden their offerings by introducing new purchase options such as the recently released pre-pay system while failing to address the issues at hand. On top of all this, they show a complete disregard for our privacy.
When is a REAL company going to step up to the plate?

What the hell is avalanche spa powder? Some quick googling tells me its some type of research chemical / legal / synthetic high product. Some type of bath salt or something?

I did plan on waiting, but how long should I wait before it becomes obvious they have no idea? I guess that's really the question.
