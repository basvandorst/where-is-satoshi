Well its making gambling with bitcoin impossible because it requires transactions to post in 15 minutes to be valid. I'll be waiting for like 7 days now to get credit.

I've already made huge profits from bitcoin, I was an early adopter, and am a current miner. I managed to sell off the majority of my holdings around $190 and now I'm holding just a few hundred bitcoins, and mining away.
