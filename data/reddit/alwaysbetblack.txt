Does that mean you think it's a little and she thinks it's a lot?

What is a reversed buy order?

Thank you very much for this very easy to understand step by step process in plain English.

No, because even if you have ALL exchange data you are not privy to private sales.

Ummm...we haven't gone up fast (in relative bitcoin speed) to any "hundred" mark lately. So I say yes. Then almost just as quickly we will hit $1000 and then we will hit $1100 so fast that it will be over $1200 by the time CNBC reports it.

Translated for the North Americans in the crowd:
It was at 235,391 BTC when I started logging in. It’s now on 114,218 BTC.

My guess is 2 million Bitcoin users worldwide.

What about your bank? Did they also refuse payment to coinbase on Sept 23?

If you add any public address to your blockchain wallet and enable email notification you will get emails for all activity on that wallet.

I am buying more for sure. Just want the best price. I'd love to see $450 soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:09:21
I haven't learned any lessons yet because I haven't received my bitcoin. But as soon as I do I will post that lesson here.

Is this why coinbase sometimes describes some sales as "you sold Bitcoins" and for other sales sometimes describe it as "You sent money to coinbase" ?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:50:31
The main reason to use an exchange is the ability to day trade. To do this you must have funds on deposit in your exchange account. If you are buying to hold for 1 week +, i.e. not panic sell, I'd continue to use coinbase for the simplicity.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:37:57
Not unrelated. If you say coinbase keeps coins stored in multiple ways it may explain why my sales have 2 different types of descriptions
"you sold Bitcoins"  or
"You sent money to coinbase" 
Both descriptions are used at different times when I sell to coinbase.

Thank you. Now misterporkbuns talked me into gambling.

Does the FDIC prevent bank robberies?

I think my 96 year old grandfather has a better chance of understanding bitcoin than I do of understanding this drivel. 
If English is not your first language please accept my apology.

I would also like the answer to this. Up voting for visibility.
