I tend to agree with you on the need for Bitcoin to be used as a currency AT SOME POINT. I think that if the market cap continues to rise at some point the it will be high enough to draw in many more merchants including the top tier ones. More use cases will have developed by then and price might have plateaued and stabilized,  further encouraging new users to buy some Bitcoin and encouraging hodlers to spend what they have.

For the consumer Bitcoin and porn are a perfect match. You don't have to leave your CC info with some sketchy payment processor, or have those CC charges show up in the mail for others to read. Also with Bitcoin you can do a one time payment and the porn site can't pull funds from you every month via "recurring billing".  I think the lack of recurring billing and the fact that so few people have/use Bitcoin is why porn companies are not flocking to Bitcoin.

I am certainly no expert on verifying silver coins.  But I wouldn't expect to see as much counterfeiting in silver coins especially the smallest ones as there would be more profit in counterfeiting gold coins. Not being able to verify a fake gold coin the size of your thumbnail might cost you $70 where not detecting a fake silver coin of the same size would only set you back about $1. There is an Android phone app called Bullion Test that verifies coins by sampling the sound produced by striking various gold and silver coins and comparing it to the sound of genuine coins. It works really well but is limited to mostly coins around one ounce in weight.

I've been having all kinds of problems with Breadwallet this past week. Examples: wallet needs to sync for 40 minutes before doing transaction, transaction to BitPay failing, error message occurs when sending funds but message disappears before I can read it, error message about insufficient funds even though balance is enough (even with miner fee). I gave up and downloaded Coinomi. It works great. Even allows easy sweeping of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold from paper wallets. Not only that it includes an option to trade your Bcash and Bgold to Bitcoin right in the App (via Changelly).

Bitcoin has seen several bubbles in its nearly nine year existence. After each bubble pop, experts appear out of nowhere declaring Bitcoin to be dead. There will be a final bubble at some point, where it reaches its maximum price/value. Could be days away or years away. No one really knows. Its final value after all the speculators have come and gone, will reflect what utility Bitcoin brings to the world.  Will it be used mostly as a store of value, a better currency on the web, cross border payments, micro payments, strategic asset for corporations/governments,  Swiss bank account replacement, dark market enabler, hedge against inflation, oppressive regime refugees, Saudi Prince secret funds storage...?

Sure there are gold bugs who will remain in gold till death do they part, but I know for a fact that some people are trading in their gold for Bitcoin, realizing it has many of the same properties as gold with some added features as well. Precious metal newsletters include advice to purchase Bitcoin and a common answer to the "why Bitcoin" question asked on TV financial shows, is it is a store of value, a digital gold. I myself traded in some gold and silver for Bitcoin in 2013.

Silver Bolivare coins were in circulation in Venezuela into the 1960's.

Any new cryptocurrency would be starting from zero value. Most will remain near zero value or become completely worthless. A new cryptocurrency is unlikely to reach the bitcoin valuation because of the network effect, the large number of merchants accepting it, the public awareness of bitcoin. Think what would happen if someone tried to introduce a new email or Internet protocol. Not likely to gain any traction.

Too expensive? Bitcoin is not a gallon of gas or a cheeseburger or a cell phone. When you buy $100 of dogecoin or litecoin or bitcoin you are getting $100 worth of purchasing power. One crypto currency is not more expensive than another even though you receive more units of one over the other.  I get 3235 Thai Baht  per $100 or 59 British pounds. This doesn't mean pounds are too expensive or Baht too cheap.

Most people realize that Bitcoin won't continue to rise in value forever and many will think that we might be at or near the ultimate all time high, and therefore spend some of their holdings. Also I think most people have a general idea of when they want to sell. For some it might be after a 2x gain while others might be waiting for 10x. So I don't really think the slow rate of adoption is the result of Bitcoiners not spending. I just don't think there is currently enough Bitcoin value ($112 billion) to make it worthwhile for retailers and companies to bother with.

The author Dominic Frisby was on the Max Keiser show (youtube 1:42 long clip) in Nov. 2013 talking about how everyone was telling him to buy bitcoin when it was at $1 and then watching it go to $2 and thinking "I'm not buying that it has doubled".  Even on that Nov. show he says of investing in Bitcoin at $320/BTC  "I'd be careful because it's gone up so much."  I wonder if he has bought some yet, or is he waiting for it to stop going up so much?

I have no idea how its going to get there and how many bumps and rides and ups and downs we're going to have before we get there, but those are the two possible trajectories for bitcoin. It really doesn't have a midway, easy slow growth pattern. It either dies because of a fundamental fault or flaw in the system or an external attack that is successful, which quite honestly is  unlikely or it survives and if it survives it thrives and explodes across the globe in patterns of adoption like we've just seen with China, and it's heading to hundreds of thousands of dollars  and there's nothing weird about that....it's not a stock, it's a currency."

Am I the only one who thinks the new bit naming needs to be rethunk? You are saying "1 bit = 1 ubit" . This would be the same as saying 1 watt equals 1 microwatt. Saying 1 bit = 1 microbitcoin would be less confusing. To take it one step further toward clarity I think we should use the term "Nakamoto" to mean millionth of a bitcoin thus eliminating the confusing "bits" and "micro".

I was watching a few nutball youtubers talking about precious metals in early 2013 and mentioning bitcoin. Then I saw Max Keiser flapping about it when it was $4. I was excited about the possibilties of cutting out middlemen and giving the middle finger salute to the banksters. I could hardly sleep for a week and considered buying 5000 coins. The price quickly shot to $14.50 before I made my first purchase.

Real money such as bitcoin, gold and silver don't need backing. They have all the characteristics of money, so they ARE money.  Having a cryptocurrency with gold backing introduces counterparty risk and  effectively turns that coin into a promissary note.

Marc Andreessen, in a recent interview, talks about bitcoin the currency being  one of a thousand applications. The other 999 possible applications could include  digital title, digital media assets, digital stocks and bonds, insurance contracts etc.  It is my understanding that those applications/assets need only one Satoshi to have a place in the blockchain. If so then it seems that the introduction of these non bitcoin currency apps/assets would only minimally affect the value/price of  bitcoin the currency. True?

 " people talk about the finite supply of Bitcoin  (but) you can break your Bitcoins down into many many pieces so there's plenty of Bitcoin for everybody" 
He was incorrectly trying to prove that Bitcoin isn't rare or valuable by the fact that it is highly divisible (to 8 decimal places).

A British man who threw away a hard drive containing bitcoins worth $7.5 million has started searching his local landfill in an attempt to find it again. James Howells amassed 7,500 bitcoins in 2009, but disposed of the hard drive they were stored on earlier in 2013 after it sat unused in a drawer for three years.
On a positive note, they are only worth about $3 million now.

Asking what both fiat and gold are backed by is a good response to get people thinking. But I think concentrating on "backing" and "intrinsic value" and other similar terms misses the point.  What makes gold and bitcoin valuable is they have several of the qualities that make something a good form of money, such as scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, its' difficulty to counterfeit etc.

If I give a $100 bill (note) to one person (group A) and distribute one hundred $1 notes to one hundred people (group B), both group A and group B have the same amount of money (purchasing power). Now, if I give a bitcoin with a value of $100 to one person (group C) and distribute one hundred 1/100ths of a bitcoin to one hundred people (group D) both group C and group D have the same amount of bitcoin/money (purchasing power).

 "I use a never online Piper to generate cold storage addresses. We'll never know if these downloadable UNIX boot ISOs or Piper aren't maliciously coded to print hierarchical deterministic wallets for which a malicious coder has the master private seed.
Therefore I use offline vanitygen with a custom prefix, them command line shred the any saved copies of the key."
What you describe in your last sentence is possible with the Piper and nothing else?

When bitcoin was hitting all time highs over $1000 we started seeing all those stories of people buying Lamborghinis and space trips etc. I think when many people see a large price rise they see it as an opportunity to spend their winnings. Also how else could you explain Bitpays exponential growth other than to say that bitcoin spending is increasing?

which allowed you to send and receive payments of any size from one cent to $10 million by mobile phone in seconds across town or to/from any country in the world regardless of government for almost no fees, without the need for any third party such as a bank or credit card company, without the need of the sender/receiver knowing anything more about you than you are willing to provide.

Does it use up fractions of a Bitcoin each time it runs? Are transaction fees necessary to run the program?  What if transaction fees change over time?  Does it run once a day? Would it subtract  bitcoins each time it runs, until an "oracle" tells the program I'm dead, then pay out the 3 bitcoins?

My understanding is that  the Piper paper wallet printer and the Mycelium Entropy paper wallet generator and the Bitaddress paper wallet are all using Base58check (the 52 character long  alphanumeric string) and calling it a private key.

...but he also said this around October of 2013 on The Bitcoin Group: "I see that bitcoin is going to end up in the zero category or in the hundreds of thousands of dollars category in the next three years. I have no idea how its going to get there and how many bumps and rides and ups and downs we're going to have before we get there, but those are the two possible trajectories for bitcoin. It really doesn't have a midway, easy slow growth pattern. It either dies because of a fundamental fault or flaw in the system or an external attack that is successful, which quite honestly is  unlikely or it survives and if it survives it thrives and explodes across the globe in patterns of adoption like we've just seen with China, and it's heading to hundreds of thousands of dollars  and there's nothing weird about that....it's not a stock, it's a currency."

I don't think it's possible for me to determine bitcoins ultimate all time high (ATH) by looking at adoption, or public awareness, merchant acceptance, wallet downloads, growth of bitcoin ATM's, or government regulations etc. For all I know bitcoin has already hit its ATH (due to speculation) of about $1100 in October. What I am more certain about is that IF bitcoin is going back above $1100 I expect  it will do so in the next 12 months. If not Ill probably convert a large portion of my bitcoin holdings to something else. At how many months would you concede that bitcoin is never  going above $1100 again? And how did you come to your conclusion.

Historically fiat currencies don't devalue to zero overnight. That process usually takes years. Bitcoin price would rise inversely with the devaluation of fiat.

I have been surprised by the lack of adoption of Bitcoin over the last few years. There was a surge of retailers beginning to accept Bitcoin and coinmap.org was showing more and more brick and mortar stores accepting Bitcoin during the 2013 bubble. But all that activity seems to have reduced to a trickle. I live in an area with population of 200000 with lots of international travelers/tourists who must convert their countries currency to the local currency. It seems like the perfect place for Bitcoin merchants, but there is not one brick and mortar store accepting Bitcoin. Also I am surprised that Google and YouTube don't yet  use Bitcoin to pay their affiliates. Amazon so called "mechanical Turks" are paid in store credit when they would prefer Bitcoin (I think purse.io proves this).  Why the lack of adoption in these sectors? Thanks!!

"I see that bitcoin is going to end up in the zero category or in the hundreds of thousands of dollars category in the next three years. I have no idea how its going to get there and how many bumps and rides and ups and downs we're going to have before we get there, but those are the two possible trajectories for bitcoin. It really doesn't have a midway, easy slow growth pattern. It either dies because of a fundamental fault or flaw in the system or an external attack that is successful, which quite honestly is  unlikely or it survives and if it survives it thrives and explodes across the globe in patterns of adoption like we've just seen with China, and it's heading to hundreds of thousands of dollars  and there's nothing weird about that....it's not a stock, it's a currency."

I don't know the answer to your question and I am not an expert but if history is any guide I would expect the dollar to die slowly over a period of years as many other government currencies have. That would give the government time to establish some kind of gold redemption program. The U.S.A had redeemable gold and silver certificates through the years. I would think they could easily declare each federal reserve note to be redeemable for some  amount of gold or silver at your nearest (federal reserve??) bank.

I don't don't see a destruction by dilution playing out for Bitcoin. Adding a new cryptocurrency or thousands of cryptocurrencies doesn't have the same effect as adding fiat currency or gold to the existing supply. Adding fiat or gold to the existing supply reduces the value of the existing supply proportional to the amount added, since they are accepted into the system at face value. Adding a new crypto only dilutes Bitcoins value slightly and only if that crypto actually attains any value over time. Plus the increasing demand for Bitcoin is far outweighing the diluting/inflationary effects of new cryptocurrencies.

What you're  calling intrinsic value is really subjective value. The cryptoalien currency might gain a subjective value upon evaluation by humans.

Gold and silver have been money for thousands of years, so Bitcoin could be traded for and valued in ounces of gold or silver. The number of ounces per Bitcoin would be determined by the free market. Also private individuals and businesses could trade their goods and services for whatever amount of Bitcoin the market determines is fair. Even today, Bitcoin can be traded for gold, cars, real estate, online electronics, phone minutes, air tickets etc. without any reference to or need for government money.

I think there are plenty of  bitcoin owners that are willing to spend their Bitcoin, but the total value of the Bitcoin they are willing to part with (maybe $5 billion?) is too low to get retailers interested. I think the bottleneck is currently with merchants. Maybe a 10x increase in Bitcoin price is what is needed to bring any significant number of merchants in.

But if an increasing number of people just buy up Bitcoin and sit on it, that will increase the price causing whales to sell distributing coins into more hands. More buyers/holders increases price resulting in positive feedback loop for media attention. Eventually at some price point major retailers are incentivized to accept it then corporations and possibly government  start buying. That all seems good for decentralization.

It is understandable to think the price of Bitcoin is high right now especially if you look at a price chart over the last year. There might be a big price drop coming below its current level . However it's also possible that we will never see these price levels again. 2013 saw a much faster price appreciation from $100 to $1000. Here is a thought experiment. If you think the Bitcoin price is expensive at $7000/btc, do you think the $USD is more expensive because it costs 22,000VND/$USD (That's 22,000 Vietnamese Dong)

Okay here i think is another interesting contrast between the lottery and Bitcoin. Out of everyone who has ever bought a lottery ticket, maybe one in a million or one in ten million will get a return of  their initial investment. That's .000001 percent or .0000001 percent. But out of everyone who has ever bought and is holding Bitcoin, 100 percent have seen their initial investment rise. In many cases rise by  100's, 1000's, and 10,000's percent.

Bitcoin exchanges have a history of getting hacked or having the owners run away with your loot.

I think you are correct that it is technically possible. However I don't see this really benefitting anyone. In fact many bitcoiners like the idea of an immutable blockchain, and a known currency creation rate. How many people bought Bitcoin assuming lost bitcoins would remain lost. It's a selling point. Adding/replacing bitcoins is breaking the promise of CREATING only 21 million coins. I don't believe there was ever a mention of MAINTAINING a level of 21 million coins.

Are you sure about this? What about a different scenario? Let's say a man is selling a used  car. He will accept another car in trade/payment.  A buyer arrives and takes delivery of the car and  verbally agrees (audio and video recorded with buyers permission)to bring the seller a 2011 Toyota Corolla as payment within 24 hours. A week goes by and no Toyota from the buyer. Seller posts info on internet about being scammed by the buyer. Do you think the buyer would be able to sue for defamation of character and libel in this case. If not, what specifically makes this case different from the restaurant case?

You mention bitcoins use as a currency and speculative demand, but what about store of value? While I don't think speculative demand is the same as store of value demand, I don't think the two are mutually exclusive either. I have some gold for both short term speculation and long term (read: till death do us part)store of value. I think Bitcoin can perform both functions as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:01:58
Interesting. The current lack of a "whole marketplace of goods and services using the Bitcoin infrastructure" concerns me as well. I don't know if it can pass through this mostly speculator phase to a store of value phase and eventually on to a currency phase. I would add that gold probably had a similar price discovery in its beginning similar to what's currently happening with Bitcoin.  Imagine the first person trying to exchange his newly discovered pretty yellow rock for a goat? But now gold seems to be holding value pretty well despite a lack of use as a currency in buying goods and services. Of course it has what Bitcoin doesn't and that's  several thousand years of history as money, so that is providing some foundation to its value.

Sure, some of the value of gold comes from speculators looking to buy low and sell high for a profit. But I think the majority of its value comes from its long history being money and being used as a store of value. Also central banks and governments hold thousands of tons of the stuff. Bitcoin seems to be slowly but surely taking on the role of gold in this new  Information Age with some important added features making it superior to gold. With a gold market cap of $7 trillion and Bitcoin market cap of under $90 billion, its not hard to imagine how much more valuable Bitcoin could become if it continues eating into psyche of the gold community, governments and the population as a whole. And that's just the use case as a gold replacement.

Bitcoin has had plenty of time to do so with the added advantage of having low fees for much of its 9 years of existence. Yet there is barely a Bitcoin dent in that market.

I not an expert, but here is some general advice. You can answer most of your own questions by just starting to use Bitcoin. It's best to get a small amount of Bitcoin and send and receive it to/from paper wallets and a software wallet app such as Mycelium or Bread Wallet (which I am using). Either should be fine.  For security, in order of best to worst 1.Hardware wallet 2. Paper wallet. 3. Software Wallet "app". Think of the software wallet like the wallet you keep cash in. Only for small amounts. The hardware and paper wallets are for larger amounts and good for long term storage. So as I said before you can PM me a PUBLIC address from your paper wallet or your Mycelium wallet to see how it works.

From an online news source "AML Bitcoin creator Marcus Andrade and his colleagues who want to 'prevent Congress from unintentionally destroying the digital currency industry'".  So while that quote sounds neutral, will AMLBitcoin be actively lobbying against anonymous/pseudonymous cryptos such as Bitcoin?  It seems people have grown complacent and have accepted an increasing amount of government oversight into their monetary affairs. And the worldwide movement away from cash is worrying. We've had thousands of years of freedom in transacting in completely fungible currencies, but with the introduction of the Internet, that fungibility is increasingly rare. Luckily, acting like cash on the Internet, Bitcoin is an effort to take back some of our lost monetary sovereignty.  I'm afraid AMLBitcoin efforts, will be a step backwards, decreasing fungibility for digital/crypto currencies.

"A banana is 1 satoshi and two apples are one satoshi. The more decimals are added so the banana is 100 satoshis and an apple is 50 satoshis."  What? No!! If the price in Bitcoin of bananas and apples increases or decreases it would be due to the change in the value of Bitcoin (as we've seen in the last few years due solely to demand), and NOT because of any changes in decimal places.
I think you are confused by a couple of things. Bitcoins value changes with the change in demand for it. However its value doesn't change when/if the divisibility increases (ie by adding decimal places). The reason one would want to add more decimal places to Bitcoin is if the smallest subunit becomes too valuable to purchase the least valuable thing (a pack of gum, an online tip or small online purchase).

@_date: 2015-04-21 19:07:21
Think of the 21 million bitcoins as 21 million buckets into which you can pour value.
If you subdivide each bucket (add decimal places),  that doesn't change the value held in the bucket. Also think of your bank account. If you currently have $100 in the bank, it is probably represented by $100.00. If the government/banks suddenly decided to introduce "mills" in addition to "cents" then your bank account would now be $100.000. You still have the same $100.  Your weekly paycheck might go from $779.59 to $779.590. The value you are receiving remains the same, Similarly adding decimal places to Bitcoin doesn't do anything except make Bitcoin more divisible.

I would say sitting on Bitcoin gives it real value. Doesn't the same logic apply to gold. Granted, some of gold's value can be attributed to its' use in electronics and jewelry, but most of golds value is attained because it has money properties (rare,divisible, fungible, transportable etc) so people just "sit on it" for years and years knowing when they need to tap into that value they can, and exchange it for something else of value.  The same seems to be happening with Bitcoin, although too early to know for sure.

People collectively realized that leaded gasoline fumes were not so good for us and we decided to begin phasing out lead in gas. How about we focus on increasing the use of and decrease the cost of solar and wind. Let's come up with cheaper energy storage with batteries, and pumped hydro etc.  Can we we collectively decide that maybe it is okay to pay a bit more for solar and wind in the short term as we did with unleaded gas? Solar and wind actually might be cheaper in the long run if we consider the health damage caused by leaded gas and coal. Maybe I'm just a dreamer.

You can't apply the properties of fiat money (Dollars, Euros Yen) to Bitcoin. The dollar money supply has increased a huge amount especially recently and is guaranteed to go down in value, but Bitcoin supply is increasing at a much lower rate and it is a new currency seeing huge new investment so naturally the price has been rising. It's possible that Bitcoin will be seen mainly as a digital gold, with very little use as a currency. But I think at some market cap value, say $2 trillion,  large companies will be compelled to start accepting Bitcoin as there would be too much value in Bitcoin not to tap into it.

I currently have a wallet on blockchain.info with a link to my IPAD BLOCKCHAIN app. I would like   to create several offline paper wallets using bitaddress.org.  and send all of the bitcoins to my paper wallets. I read that it is dangerous to remove bitcoins from a paper wallet and send them  to an online wallet because of creating change and new addresses and possibly losing coins.  Is this also an issue with sending bitcoins to several paper wallets from a single online blockchain.info wallet? Should I send the coins to the paper wallets from the blockchain.info website wallet or from my IPAD blockchain app.   Thanks.

In a fairly recent youtube video (Bitcoin Group  Andreas states the following:
"I see that bitcoin is going to end up in the zero category or in the hundreds of thousands of dollars category in the next three years. I have no idea how its going to get there and how many bumps and rides and ups and downs we're going to have before we get there, but those are the two possible trajectories for bitcoin. It really doesn't have a midway, easy slow growth pattern. It either dies because of a fundamental fault or flaw in the system or an external attack that is successful, which quite honestly is  unlikely or it survives and if it survives it thrives and explodes across the globe in patterns of adoption like we've just seen with China, and it's heading to hundreds of thousands of dollars  and there's nothing weird about that....it's not a stock, it's a currency."
