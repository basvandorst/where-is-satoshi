Really? Has this word lost ALL MEANING to reddit?
It's not censorship unless he's in your tubes, blocking every attempt you make to talk about bitcoin. If they were removing your posts due to some kind of agenda, you know what that would be called? *Moderating.* God forbid you be forced to use a term which isn't hyperbolic. 
Also what the hell, how do you even have a bitcoin agenda? This isn't r/politics, there are no opinions to take, beyond denying bitcoin exists.

Oh god, you're moronic. God forbid someone lurk instead of post regularly. 




When I see one of those rules enforced (beyond removal of illegal/irrelevant topics) I will eat my own hair. Downvotes don't count as removal.

You know, you could have just linked to the clip and not to your blog,  I can't tell from my phone but if there are ads on there, r/reportthespammers calls that blogspam.

Mister bitmit, can you please remove the option to disable escrow for transactions? There's literally nothing to protect buyers should they be stupid enough to ignore the "escrow: no" comment on this post. There is no feasible reason to not have escrow with a system like this.

Oh man, where is he in the uk? I have some money to drop on a new GPU, but not much, and this might be my chance.

... It's not just banks.
Somalia is in a state of civil war, and it's relatively reasonable to assume that if it's in a state of civil war they cannot guarantee the safety of any post, packages or money sent to somalia. To this purpose, bitcoin is very well suited, therefore yes, we (they) need bitcoin.
But I'm going to say, much as reddit enjoys hating on big corporations, if the banks are losing money from "vanishing" bank transfers because of the political climate, it's reasonable to stop them. So this isn't the fault of these banks, even if they're calling it "terrorist activities." The simple matter is that nobody wants to be liable for money that's going to disappear. Plus if the government finds that the banking service was used for illegitimate activities, they'll have the patriot act down on their heads.

Also, escrow is disabled. OP gets money whether he ships this or not.

Don't get me wrong here, don't think I'm telling you how to run your business here... But usually, aren't new startups run at a loss for the first X BTC or so, to establish a userbase, then you can slowly up your margins until ingoing/outgoing match? That's what an education of business studies told me, anyway. Perhaps start at MT.gox prices, make back your losses over time?
But best of luck, sleek website too!
