Why not both? Increase the blocksize and do layer 2 solutions as well?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:33:47
wrong sub, in this sub they don't care about nakamoto or having decentralized peer to peer cash that you can actually transact with

I saw some interesting information on this. Apparently Lightning Network is not quite what was promised. There's a link on this, but if I post it here my comment will be automatically removed by the moderators.
Google for 'medium  mathematical proof that the lightning network cannot be a decentralized bitcoin scaling solution'

What do you think is the impact of transaction fees on decentralization? Do you believe bitcoin will be more or less centralized with high transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:22:04
1. You might want to transact with bitcoin as well
2. If transaction fees are so high that it's only for the wealthy (even now at $10), you centralize it's usage
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:38:26
The real reason is that this sub is heavily and silently being censored. I had a comment with a link to a technical issue regarding the lightning network silently censored. Logged in I would see my comment but if I'm logged out it's gone.
An open technical uncensored debate seems to threaten the mods of this subreddit.

The idea is to increase it to 4mb, 8mb etc later. Blocksize can be increased to allow for 500 tx/s with the current bitcoin implementation and moderate consumer hardware. Seems like a scaling solution to me
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:18:13
No idea. First time. It's a silent censorship as well, so you have no idea. The mods of this sub are only allowing one viewpoint, and it's completely distorting people's views on bitcoin here.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:48:21
You only need a fraction of the taxes we in reality pay for everything you mentioned. Bondholders need to get paid. The taxes are not justified whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:04:30
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is one line of code, and it's been how many years now?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:01:06
Technically you're right in that a node becomes more expensive, but if you're going to be honest you'd have to acknowledge that it is merely a hiccup in the longer trend, since hardware becomes cheaper over time.
But sure alright, a node becomes more expensive. Let's go with that. But so do transactions, right? Now, let's say you run a node. You're probably a bitcoin user, am I right? Do you think the cost increase for the node outweighs the higher transaction fees you'll be paying? Did you calculate the difference? Which one do you think is more?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:08:53
Do you think it still matters how cheap your node is if transactions are $20? For who will you be running your node?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:01:50


Nope of course not but it will allow for a larger user base before we reach those fees. It's called scaling.


The point is, there is no reason to be part of the network if transaction fees are outside your budget. So yes, trusting rules &amp; security will be irrelevant for you individually. So you're limiting your decentralization to the top 1%. Now that's not much decentralization is it. I'd rather make bitcoin accessible globally for everyone. Maybe you don't.


I do. And it has nothing to do with 2mb. More so with mining economies of scale.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:52:39
While the attitude seems to be 'wait and see', new users are unpleasantly surprised by long confirmation time and expensive transactions. Growth is massively hindered. Users seek alternatives.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:53:50
Hahah. You're right. In this subreddit it's very contentious. Since that represents your worldview, I guess I can't argue with that.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:40:34
what's wrong with increasing the block size to 2mb?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:21:24
The only reason it's contentious is cause you guys over here keep shouting that it's contentious. Everyone else ignores r/bitcoin and seems pretty calm about it.
Let's be honest. You can't really come up with a solid reason why 2MB is not a good idea. So why is it that you so badly want to prevent the upgrade?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:26:21
The reason it drops is because bitcoin doesn't reward nodes. Welcome to bitcoin.
Let me ask you this. Let's say the transaction fee of one payment is the same as the cost to run a full node for a month. Would you say then still say that the superior node decentralization is worth it?
Let me ask you something else. If transaction fees are $20, who will run a node? Do you think the ordinary users that you care so much about would still run a node, even if the node is cheap? What's the point of running a node if you're not going to pay $20 to send someone btc?
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:26:56
You claim to be concerned with the network foundation, but ignore the fact that there is literally 0 reason to run a node for a normal user if normal transaction fees are too high ($5, $10, $20, $50, you name it), apart from ideological reasons. If the purpose of running a node is having trusted validation, what exactly am I interested in validating if I can't even afford transactions?
Or do you believe we won't reach such level of tx fees?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:56:53
Hahah. You're a funny person. Cause I believe you really mean what you say.




hahaha, for real ey
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:44:08


It's pretty widely accepted bro, you know in this reddit there's moderators removing opposing viewpoints yeah? Have a look somewhere else for a change.


10 largest businesses? I recall it's 58 businesses signing the NYA, plus 80-85% of the hashpower. Where's your minimum threshhold? Or are you shouting that it's contentious simply because you disagree?


And 2mb prevents this?


Given transaction fees increasing on a constant blocksize, do you think that the foundation of the network becomes stronger or weaker over time? If I'm a bitcoin user and it's cheap to run a full node but transactions are $20, why should I run one?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:47:00


The fee of one transaction being equivalent to the monthly cost of a full node is balance? (not yet? yeah wait for it)
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:49:34


Lol wow. You're hoping it won't happen? Haha. Have a look at the tx fee over time chart. Or use common sense. If more people use bitcoin, but the transaction throughput is constant, less people will be able to transact. Guess what happens to the fee?
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:54:49
If you claim 1MB is optimal now in 2017, which I think would be a tough case to make, given hardware improvements in what year will 2MB be optimal?
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:31:57
Just thinking ahead buddy. With constant throughput but increasing number of users and btc price, transaction fees go up. Have a look at the tx fee over time chart. $20 tx fee is only a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:51:10
Hahah. Right. Let's solve a problem in bitcoin by... not solving it and using another coin. Lol.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:14:21
When and how would you prefer to do it?
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:49:49
Brainwashed much? Upgrading from 1mb to 2mb to allow more transactions to go through destroys decentralization? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:09:20
Ahhh so you're worried about hard forks. Gotcha.
So what's the worst thing that can happen in a 2mb hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:47:27
Hehe all good buddy. You change your mind anytime soon. =)
