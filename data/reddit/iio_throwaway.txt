[I posted about another unsettling Inputs.io issue on a different reddit.] ( Posting here for increased visibility. Get your money out of there now.
While I haven't been affected by this particular theft, I want to share an Inputs.io experience that is equally unsettling. Please upvote for visibility ... this is a throwaway account so I don't care about the karma.
**disclaimer: inputs.io support has been very responsive and actually reimbursed me out of their personal wallet while this is investigated, but you should still be aware of this issue**
I've made many purchases with my inputs.io wallet and twice now, I've been struck with a glitch where my browser locks up for a brief period of time and payment is sent twice. In one instance, actually, you can see the transactions hit the blockchain exactly one second apart, which goes to show there is no way I could have manually done it (i.e. made a mistake).
In both cases, the amount has been less than 3 BTC (which is still hundreds of dollars!) and payment was going to Coinbase, so thankfully, the overpayment was refunded to me. In addition, Inputs.io staff immediately credited me that amount while they investigated, which meant a lot.
But still, especially considering today's events, I can no longer trust inputs.io with a single satoshi. Imagine if I was paying a lot BTC to someone I didn't really know and the transaction was sent twice without any chance of getting it back ... or what if coinbase would have just automatically refunded the extra payment (which I've read they have been doing for smaller payments) ... Inputs.io doesn't really handle refunds well due to the mixing.
**I conclude this by saying, if you are going to keep using Inputs.io despite the issues I state above and despite the theft reported by OP, please be mentally prepared to lose every satoshi. They are not "production ready", clearly.**

Credited my account in their own system ... which I was then able to immediately withdraw.
Good question though ;)
