Bullshit. Self-interest and capitalism are what drive the human race forward. Not the bernie sanders hippie feel good socialist bullshit.

I just send my friends screenshot of my portfolio going up 50K every day. Feeslgoodman.jpeg
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:49:57
In this game since 2013. Portfolio can swing 70K+  or - on any given day and I sleep just fine. Holding until BTC price is well beyond 6 figures.
The poorfags crying about their $30 stake make me cringe.

If they can't make ends meet it's because they make bad decisions. Period.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:12:00
Too bad for them. Survival of the fittest. If you want to subsidize such a person do it out of your own pocket.

A smart opportunist.

I don't care if they're necessary or not, you can't complain about being poor when you deliberately select a career path that has a low salary cap and no real prospects of advancement. It's as simple as that. I don't respect people with no ambition. And if a couple hundred bucks is the extent of your disposable income, investing that in yourself will probably yield much higher results in the long term than investing it in crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:44:30
You're 27 and have been working minimum wage for 10 years. Why? Do you have zero ambition or are you just lazy?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:51:30
It's capitalism. How exactly is he ruining people's financial lives of financial future? Can you actually explain that?
Firstly if you're all in on crypto then you've accepted the risks. Secondly AFAIK if you held and didn't panic or cave in to the FUD your BTC holdings should be at an all time high.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:08:22
Why? You told them no and you found out that they're classless grubs who expect handouts. So what's the problem? Or maybe they said it jokingly and you took it seriously because you don't have a sense of humor?
TBH I've told plenty of people that I've made 6 figure profits with BTC and no one's ever asked me for money, maybe you just keep shitty company. Either way it's a good way to filter out the kind of people that you want to be around. And if you're working with people who are impressed with 400 euro profit, you're working with bums.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:42:08
So what. You really think the ATO has the power to track this shit? Unless you're stupid enough to deposit double digit BTC holdings in an Australian exchange they'll never know about it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:21:35
Lol £100 max. That's pocket money spare change, are you serious?
First, never invest in anything that you don't understand. Second, come back when you've actually got some real money to play with.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:58:36
Get a better one you bum.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:46
wtf santa isn't real? Are you srs.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:27:33
Only 30%? Lmao did you get in like a week or two ago?
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:17:26
Lmao, typical victim mentality bs. Crying about injustice and how your life is so tough, blaming some generational scapegoat for your failings.
Again, this attitude is typical of poor people who always need to blame someone else. Guess what, there are plenty of people who are not baby boomers who are absolutely killing it, despite all these perceived injustices that you cry about. The year is 2017 there have never been more opportunities to make some $$$.
Lol at your last sentence. You think the point of bitcoin is to topple over baby boomers? What are you 12?
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:59:18
A proper asset manager would evaluate someone's individual circumstances and not give out blanket recommendations such as don't exceed a "10%" allocation.
Everyone has a different risk profile.

Nursing has a very low and limited salary cap, you should probably reconsider your career choice.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:18:08
And how exactly have you arrived at that conclusion? Do you have some sort of magical way to attribute BTC holdings to age brackets? Or are you one of those who thinks that millennials are all computer savvy because they know how to use facebook? Lmao
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:21:27
Everyone has their own version of what amount would be life changing.
When you have less than a million you compare yourself against people that have a million or two. When you have a million you compare yourself against people that have 10 million. Etc etc.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:12:44
Your attitude is typical of poor people. You want to get rich quick, stop working, and live a life of pure leisure.
If you actually look at most billionaires, they never "retire", instead they continue working hard which is what got them rich in the first place.
Who are you to tell another man what to do with his capital? How do you even know what he does with it? Clearly he has a much larger vision than you can even fathom. How many people do you employ and provide jobs to?
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:45:40
Yeah right. If you're assuming that just millennials have skin in the bitcoin game you're gravely mistaken. In fact I'd postulate that most millennials don't have much BTC if at all.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:29:23
$300 isn't an investment unless you're in a dirt poor third world country. If that's seriously all that you have at your disposal, the last thing you should be doing is buying bitcoins with it.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:59:28
You were able to afford to "flight" home? And you call yourself an English teacher?
I think you should have spent the BTC on English lessons. And the fact that you don't have a fiat emergency fund sufficient enough to cover the meager costs of air travel means that you shouldn't be invested in bitcoin at all. Sort your shit out.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:50:08
Lmao, so what if they know you bought $1000 worth of BTC in year xy from an exchange? You could have spent it, could have lost it, could have done absolutely anything with it. They don't have the forensic capability to trace it and even if they could it would just lead back to a particular address, there is no way to actually attribute them to you (unless you're dumb enough to hand them the private keys).
So sure, if you bought using a bank account they may be able to see that you bought some bitcoins, but they have absolutely no way to ascertain that those bitcoins are in your control.
As for cashing out there are plenty of ways to do so without leaving a paper trail.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:40:24
So what, who wants to be like most people? You should aspire for a lot more.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:20:45
These rules are stupid. I take great enjoyment in gloating to my friends and family about how much I've made. Hey, I told them this was going to be big over 4 years ago when it was ~$100 so they had the chance to get in when it was cheap (but didn't obviously).
And WTF are hackers going to do when I store everything in cold storage LMAO, good luck.
Why sell when you become a millionaire. I'm reminded of this scene from the social network:
Sean Parker: You don't even know what the thing is yet. How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? 
Eduardo Saverin:  You? 
Sean Parker: A billion dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:09:45
What I'm saying is that $300 invested into BTC isn't going to yield anywhere near as much as investing in yourself and increasing your earning ability if that's currently the extent of your disposable income.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:02:23
So get out of India? Globalization means that he's not constrained to stay in a third-world country that pays peanuts.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:41:22
I'd say the odds of it going to 0 at this stage are astronomically small. There's way too much capital and infrastructure in place for that to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:43:57
My ex-gf just told me she fucked another guy but guess what, my BTC profits have just exceeded 100K so she can go fuck herself.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:18:27
How is it criminal? People need to take responsibility for their actions. It's not criminal to take advantage of gullible people. We can debate the ethics of it, but really it's just money going from dumb hands to smarter hands. Survival of the fittest. You want a regulated market stick to the stock market.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:05:58
You need to expend your perspective. 1 million bucks invested in traditional assets in a first world country can give you enough income to live a life of pure leisure in a third world country. If leisure doesn't make you happy, there are plenty of ways that you could find purpose.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:03:08
He has the money but he's essentially locked it away for the future (not that it's a bad thing). If it works out he can have a fantastic lifestyle. Money doesn't equal happiness but I'd rather be rich and sad than poor and sad. Money = options. The more money you have the more options you have at your disposal.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:10:20
Sounds like you want to try and learn or do something new but you're a bit indecisive about exactly what. I recommend just taking action, the great thing about having money is you have the option to fail and then try something new again. Just try lots of things and keep yourself busy. IMO keeping busy and having purpose are often the answer.
