I am in the same boat. Sent to Revolut on Saturday and still waiting today. I spoke to CS around 10am and they have said that it will be in by tomorrow at the latest...
Now just hoping for a dip when it hits 10K EUR and we can all buy for cheaper than the lows on Saturday :-D

My money is through now. Just fyi.

I have been on 'hold' with their in app chat support since 09:06 ...
Initially I was told it was fine, they couldn't see any problems on their end. 
About 30 minutes later said that they can see the money was sent on Monday. I responded I have not got it yet, when should I receive?
They said oh, that's strange, we will talk to our finance team...
Now I 'bump' the support thread every 10 minutes or so and get told, "sorry for the delay" before being promptly ignored again.
Even if the hold up is on GDAX/Coinbase's side, Revolut support is not filling me with confidence here. I may just SEPA transfer directly from my main account, although I am worried they will close it (apparently people have had issues buying BTC directly with their UK accounts?)

I'll update when I receive the funds, hopefully that means we will all get our money soon. I guess its a good sign, lots of people using revolut to transfer and buy can only be good for the overall price of BTC

Just finished support with them. Looks like it is coinbase (they also have a status saying SEPA transfers from 4/12 will be a few days late...)
Looks like we are buying with fees boys! If they had put up a sign on Monday, I would have bought then when it was cheaper. Goddammit

Yup. Im tempted to just buy through coinbase and eat the fees. I wonder if they are intentionally providing a shitty service to make their own offering of btc (revolut are supplying it themselves soon) more attractive.

Not too sure tbh, probably best to PCA small regular amounts and forget about it for a while. Its distracting me from work/life

Look into vertcoin
