Isn't this because, if the prices drops, miners leave and the difficulty falls, making it cheaper to mine a bitcoin?  Looking at it this way, the cost to mine a bitcoin falls to the market prices.  That is, price of a bitcoin drives the cost of mining.
How do you argue that there is a fundamental cost to mine a bitcoin when there is changing difficulty?

Read the SPV section of the white paper. While not in the application, in the white paper Satoshi already had in mind that most users would not fully verify the whole chain. He remarked that, "businesses... will probably still want to run their own nodes..." implying that individual users would not.

No worries. Happy to have the conversation. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 23:34:54


Not according to the first line of the SPV section where it says only the headers of blocks are needed.

Wow. Spam tautology.

True, but there is diminishing marginal safety as the number gets large. The adding a 10,000th node doesn't add as much as the 2nd.

Independent. From scratch implementation in C using a novel storage scheme. Really cool stuff IMHO.

For those that don't know and from what I understand:
ETFs are pegged to an underlying by having third party market participants called Authorized Participants who at any point can create/destroy ETF shares by exchanging the underlying with the ETF.  This keeps the ETF pegged since, if ever the price goes above the underlying the AP would just create shares and profit.
So the idea here would be that whenever the ETF price goes out of whack with the market price of Bitcoins, APs could exchange bitcoins with the ETF bringing the price back in line.

There's a threshold phenomenon on mempool growth. When the transaction rate (tx/s) is low, the mempool is capped on the order of the number of transactions that arrive in the 10 interval. But, as soon as the tx rate passes the rate the network can handle the mempool grows on the order of the tx rate.

What number of full nodes do you feel is a safe number? Legitimately curious. And I think it's an important thing for the community to think about. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:44:42
Trying to figure out if you're joking.

You'll have better luck with lower cost items. A lot of the buyers (of bitcoin) on purse.io are liquidating gift cards which are smaller than the cost of iPhones. Also, big ticket items introduce more risk to them.

How do you pay for expenses with BTC? Has accepting it become popular as things have turned south? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:43:40
Median shouldn't be the metric to judge if there is a problem with confirmation times. Something like 95th percentile would be better. 
@_date: 2012-10-27 16:03:00
Wow.  Thanks for the numbers!

How is GrubGo discriminating payments if they all go to the same Bitcoin address?  If two people makes orders worth the same amount and only one pays what happens?
This isn't criticism.  I'm just curious.
@_date: 2012-02-19 04:21:54
The concern isn't about the anonymity of the user.  It's the logistics of matching payments to orders.

They're gone forever.  This problem isn't unique to bitcoin.  "Real money" is lost all the time.
If lots of money (bitcoin or otherwise) is lost, the value per bitcoin (or dollar or whatever) goes up.  However, in most reasonable cases, this is insignificant compared to say hoarding.
@_date: 2011-11-03 22:36:47
Anonymity isn't required for a bitcoin business.  In fact, I think the pervasive anonymity is holding bitcoin back.  If more real, legally bounded business used bitcoin, it would really help it flourish.
Otherwise, we risk restricting Bitcoin to an anarchist libertarian box.

A real challenge is making this process smooth and user friendly.  Especially since for some types of contracts transactions need to be passed around outside of the block chains.
I'm not saying this as a naysayer.  Making Bitcoin user friendly is key and I think contracts could be particularly difficult.  I'm looking forward to seeing what eventually happens.
@_date: 2011-11-18 00:17:41
Essentially mining should entail, not only the computations they currently do, but also transaction forwarding.

Other people have mentioned, you should keep a backup to your wallet.dat file which give you access to all your bitcoins.
I want to add that backing up wallet.dat also gives you access the bitcoins from 100 *future* transactions you've made since it contains the next 100 public/private keys pre-generated.  This gives you some leeway in how often you need to back it up.
Still... back up early... back up often.  And keep it encrypted.
@_date: 2011-10-31 00:22:04
You can implement contracts, for example.  See 
It's quite awesome, actually.

I wonder if anyone has written a bot to exploit the volume discrepancy (which probably results in a price discrepancy) between exchanges.
@_date: 2011-10-23 20:13:31
Sounds like an arbitrage opportunity!
@_date: 2011-11-03 16:17:46
How do we know they're not going to run off with the money?
Edit:  I mean, it's a great idea.  But I wouldn't invest without some sort of trust or guarantee.

[Bitcoin OTC]( lets you trade directly with people.  Many accept paypal.  There's a slight learning curve and you'll have to build some trust before big purchases.

Can you explain the original intention of the project?
@_date: 2015-11-15 14:07:56
These are usually called TWAP execution algorithms (time weighted average price). There are also VWAP (volume weighted) which do more trading when there is more volume so to move the market less. 
I agree that it would be nice if the exchanges offered this. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if third parties start offering execution services.

I haven't done it but in the US you can walk into a Chase bank and make a cash deposit to get money into a MtGox account (not directly into Bitcoin but pretty close).
Otherwise, there are websites where people are listed who you can meet in person and trade cash for bitcoins.

There wasn't much analysis in there.

It's something worth being aware of/concerned about.
For example, researchers showed that SSH keys which were generated by embedded systems, including those in some routers, didn't collect enough entropy before their initial boot up.  They found a lot of duplicate keys over the internet.

He also probably didn't write the headline.  The article is less negative than the headline suggests.
Edit: Scratch that.  It's his blog.  He probably writes the headlines there.

As I understand it, CoinJoin would save space on transaction headers.  However, since there would be as many (or possibly more) inputs and outputs in the joined transactions, it wouldn't be much of a fix.  The space problem scales by the same order, with or without CoinJoin.
