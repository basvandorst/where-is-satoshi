I was thinking the other day about how the number of bitcoins that I own are definitive proof that time travel does not become available to me in my life time.

perhaps a raindrop for every bitcoin or maybe millibitcoin transacted?  Millibits would make for some pretty serious rain but I don't think you would have so few drops in that sort of a storm if you used btc.

should gold miners from years past have left gold laying around so that it would be more fairly distributed?

I think it will drop all month.  Seems to me like we are exactly at the point we were in June from the April bubble.

i had a 9600 modem in 93.  1440 in 95, 2880 in 96, etc.
Eventually I got dsl, cable, etc.
We have had entirely opposite internet experiences it would seem.

I'm not so sure they are respecting his wishes.  I seem to remember him not liking the idea of a smaller ipad.

how many trends has apple set without steve?  I guess the downward trend on their market share.

anybody with any serious life savings type investments should have probably done at least a little bit of research first.
This was an incredibly predictable drop, just broke through the 7 week ema, on our way down to the 30 week ema before a slow recovery. 
It's currently like June 2013 from the last bubble.
Or maybe I am wrong and mtgox shutting down will be the bad news needed to start the next bubble, like silk road started the last one.

regulations are there to help the banks keep out competition.

sounds like every other bitcoin business that I would like to do business with but can't.  TigerDirect and Overstock, coinbase, pretty much everyone.

Looks like you would be a freeman 6th class, if all works out like this crazy guy plans.

I think the mark would be more like a green address.
