Not quite. The rapid price increase right now is very much irrational from an economics perspective.  Fan_of was referencing two of the functions of a currency, namely a means of exchange and a means of account.  
Means of exchange: Steady currencies allow you to exchange goods with a confidence that you are paying a reasonable value for what you are receiving (which isn't the case with bitcoin now, when you have no idea what the value might be tomorrow).  
Means of account: Steady currencies also allow businesses and individuals to know how much they are worth (bit of a simplification here), which enables other aspects of commerce such as lending. Bitcoin also fails here because, for example, no institution with a reasonable risk profile is going to offer you a loan collateralized by bitcoin.
The other main function of currency is as a store of value - think gold - which essentially means you are willing to keep it as a sign of your economic value because you think other people will consider it as roughly the same or greater value in the future.
Bitcoin is (imo at least) only useful currently as a store of value. Why is it even functioning as a store of value though?  Because people who invest in it are, at least implicitly, betting that it can someday assume the other two functions of a currency as well.  So part (most?) of the rise is certainly just speculation by people hoping to get rich quick, but there is also a bit of self-fulfilling prophesy involved in that all of the recent media attention because of the speculation is helping inform people about bitcoin and its uses, and the more people that know about it/own it, the more likely it is to gain those two other properties of a true currency.
