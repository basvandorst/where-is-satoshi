if you already have a bank account?
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:26:54
What type of account?
Exchange account? - used to transfer money from bank account to buy/sell bitcoin?
Bitcoin Wallet? - used to store you bitcoins off of the exchange, similar to a bank account.
You need both really.
I would suggest coinbase for the Exchange as it is so easy to use.
As for bitcoin wallet, I would suggest getting a hardware wallet such as a Ledger, as you want to securely store your bitcoin for many years until your son is old enough.

I'd use your own coinbase account, buy the crypto you want, and then transfer to your own bitcoin wallet.

So you won't be investing in STDCoin then?

Do you live in Singapore?
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:31:55
yesah. same thing happened to me. By the time I was set up the price had moved upward by quite some bit.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:30:40
beautifully said.
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:48:02
Yes, I fear so. I must now become, as you crypto kids say ' a hodler' for life now just in case.

To break 9k I think we need the services of the one and only Carlos Matos.
Only he can help us.

Classic! :-)

Just bought 0.1 of a Bitcoin a few hours ago, and low and behold the price jumped up shortly afterwards.
I didn't realize just how much sway I have over the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:59:48
Just bought another 0.1 Bitcoin. Now over 9K.
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:06:29
is he over 8000, or 9000? I can't remember.
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:31:22
Congrats. Your time has come.

That moon school you attended - I hope you congratulated them

Yes, using an extra passphrase on the ledger is the way to go. 24 seed words + 1 non-seed word for extra security.

I decoded your message and agree that we should hit ATH within the next few days.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:29:01
I don't want to be responsible for the fallout it would cause.
