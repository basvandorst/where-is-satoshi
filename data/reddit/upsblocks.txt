43gb a month is not a trivial amount.

Where did you get the 10s of millions number? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:42:08
"a few years"
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:38:15
1gb per day would allow 2.4 million transactions per day (86400 seconds in a day, about 2800 transactions per second).

litecoin and dogecoin seem to work just fine. 
Hell, the whole justification of forcing nodes to run uncompensated is that it's in their rational self interest to manage the network for free since they have interest for bitcoin the currency succeeding. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:32:41
I think someone should make a chart of how even people putting crazy shit numbers for predictions don't go as high as they used to. I remember 2015 was supposed to end at 10,000+ according to bitcoin experts and 2014 was going to end with hundreds of thousands. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:27:09
The advantage is that nodes work as volunteers and miners are going to have their income cut in half in a few months so there is a limit to how many resources we can demand they give us for free. 
The second advantage is that miner fees are comically tiny and have shrunk over time and if we don't figure out a way to fix that bitcoin is literally doomed and maybe making fees competitive maybe might help make fees mean something.

"a little extra something" IS profit. You are going to lose money running this. It will COST you money to get less money. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:22:32
Most people will never use bitcoin in their lifetime though
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:55:25
Remember how sure everyone was bitcoin VC money would be over a billion dollars this year but none of that happened and it didn't even make it to half a billion dollars and the whole second half of the year had virtually no major investments?
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:43:04
Thoughts: who exactly is giving this 100 thousand dollars away? For what reason exactly? 
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:33:12
The answer is no, because bitcoin is only a stand alone thing  that runs on strict rules in fantasy, in real life the devs would just change the difficulty by hand.
If bitcoin was actually autonomous then yes.
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:10:07
No plausible amount of transactions pays miners shit. You have to just hope and pray for moon adoption and that isn't a thing anyone should count on any specific year. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:14:39
I think your mistake is thinking you get a good deal on antminers and that because they are sold to you at 1500 that they actually cost 1500 to make. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:28:58
The assumptions underpinning bitcoin rely on not believing in normal people economics.  
Looking at it through the lens of school taught economics will just lead to "it's a bad currency" and you gotta kinda throw out orthodoxy and go with some sort of hyperlibertarian super pro deflation austrian economics to see the things bitcoin does as being values. 
meaning it's going to be a bad thesis in a school setting because using any sort of school learned anything you are going to very trivially find major issues, and the answers to those issues are "we don't believe that" or "this issue is how we intended it" from an alternate economic theory system that is kinda like the economic system goldbugs use but extended a bunch of weird ways with even more 'unique' assumptions that run counter to standard economic thought. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:31:34
2 times 3.5 transactions per second is still a very small number, just amazon UK was doing 84 transactions per second during the holiday shopping rush. Meaning a 24x increase in blocksize wouldn't be enough to cover even one single store in one single country transaction wise next year. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:47:56
I don't know it'd happen, bitcoin is 7 years old with less than 1 million users, I don't actually suspect at this point it's going to become a big thing. But 2.4 million transactions a day is really tiny. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:29:41
bitcoin mining isn't really computing, it's just doing a single meaningless hash very fast over and over. It's not useful for anything. When people talk about bitcoin being the fastest super computer or something they are just lying or misunderstanding. A hash isn't a floating point operation, it's not much of anything. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:24:42
Well, about 2 blocks a day are orphaned, so around 1% of your first confirmations can revert to unconfirmed. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:16:33
Turns out you really can't just write your own code without pretty much tearing the network into pieces. Which bodes poorly for long term success. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:40:02
bitcoin can only handle 250,000 transactions a day. This is way too low to be usable for anything big. 
It needs to get way bigger to be useful but it turns out asking volunteers to be nodes who work for free and cutting miners pay every few years makes it super hard to demand people take on more responsibility and use more computer resources.
Just keeping block size the same it is has seen nodes drop from 10,000 to 5,000 and miners drop from thousands to 9 people directing 90% of the hashrate.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:17:37
You absolutely can. But if a large block came in you'd be on a different blockchain with different transactions than the other one and who knows which one coinbase or newegg would take. Maybe not your random one, meaning you might be stuck with bitcoin on a chain no one knows or cares about. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:02:10
the solution to the byzantine general problem was to have just one or two generals? A mathematical breakthrough!
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:54:51
It's not cheaper than most of the competition for most of the things it's used for. It's only cheaper if you compare it to western union or something but also leave out the fact it doesn't do 90% of the things western union does for you when you pay the high price. For buying things it's the most expensive option to the user unless you count weird hypothetical abstract eventual price declines due to the merchant having less fees to pay. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:52:05
So what you are saying is proof of work has failed to solve the byzantine general's problem? 
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:20:53
Depends what they are full of. If they are full of actual transactions that mean something to someone it'd be an issue but if they are just full of meaningless nonsense made just because the blockchain is near free to post to then it won't really matter. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:40:59
Your point is that you are accepting the scam price they sell to the public as being some real price and not even considering that that price might be inflated beyond all reason because people like you are gullible. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:14:50
It's not even the biggest halfing bitcoin has ever had. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:51:32
Increasing the size is but it doesn't really help, 2mb, 10mb, 20mb, they all leave bitcoin with pathetically small numbers of possible users. To even serve a single medium sized grocery store chain bitcoin would need a blockchain that grows by GB per day and that is just unreasonable. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:47:10
You buy bitcoins then sell them to someone else for more money. You also try to convince everyone this is a sustainable model for investments so they won't be too scared to buy in late. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:15:56
Couldn't the same be said about bitcoin itself? 
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:17:15
I think you need to first state why the internet and bitcoin are similar or comparable. The only reason people seem to compare the two is because the internet is popular and some weird hope bitcoin will be popular too. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:20:19
And what if 2016 is not the year? Won't this just be posted in 2017 and 2018 and 2019? 
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:54:30
Once again posting that newsweek article like that was a real opinion and missing that that was a half page thing on the last page of an entire special issue devoted solely to talking about how amazing and revolutionary the internet was. That it was INTENTIONALLY posting an unpopular and rarely held opinion in a special issue all about the way more common opinion that the internet was great. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 03:51:37
Gavin is shady as hell. The fact he walked around with the self appointed title of "chief scientist" while being a guy with virtually no meaningful programing or research background should have been all anyone needed to know about how shifty that guy is and how he views his role in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:38:10
You forget the part where you are invested in a risky investment that may never pay you back, not a guaranteed thing that you just need to wait long enough for and you'll get rich with one weird trick banks hate. This month, next month, this year or next year or ten years from now!
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:46:13
he is literally the only "scientist" working there, what is he the chief of? 
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:34:43
The theory that bad thing happening to people will make you rich in bitcoin hasn't actually ever happened in the last 40 times people posted it, it's not gonna happen this time either. If you want to be rich actually do some work, don't just hope someone else has something bad happen to them. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:32:21
Bitcoin message boards are full of weird rewritten history where a bunch of very successful technologies and websites were once as unpopular as bitcoin is as a weird fairy tale about how if they eventually made it big that means bitcoin will too. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:49:12
How? Many altcoins had larger percentage growths, many going from zero to some non-zero number and showing infinite growth over the year. But even just ones that went from one fraction of a cent to another fraction of a cent may have grown hundreds or thousands of percent more than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 14:54:35
That seems like a real lie and the fact you are lying here makes this sound 1000x more like a scam. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:56:17
Like everything in bitcoin instead of making actual protocol standards there is just a weird mix of suggestions and defaults.  1 satoshi is a valid transaction, some nodes might not relay it and some miners might not mine it but it's perfectly valid. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:23:16
You seem to have the outdated belief that the majority of pool's hashrates come from individuals pointing at a pool, a thing that had been true in the past but was widely replaced by data warehouse mining. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 21:30:22
Yeah, if you multiple random numbers you can get other numbers. That doesn't make something a good investment. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 04:39:18
Okay, I would have good luck, almost all drug and illegal gambling business is done without bitcoin and has been forever. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 00:19:45
So what you are saying is that bitcoin users will always be stuck using a niche form of money that no one anywhere accepts, even if bitcoin took off!
@_date: 2016-01-04 05:35:47
Then just use a ACH. they are much cheaper. Wire transfers are a very specific sort of thing that you don't need to do for most transactions unless you have special legal requirements for verification or something. An ACH from bank of america will cost you around 50 cents. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:44:54
Bitcoin can only do about 500,000 transactions a day. 
This is comically tiny and needs to be bigger but the easiest way to make it bigger requires vastly more resources be taken from people that are doing a thing on a volunteer basis and on miners who already are going to be paid half as much in a few months AND requires basically making a whole new bitcoin that is incompatible with the current one.  
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:51:49
couldn't give yourself 184 bitcoin or couldn't bring that old boy back? 
Everyone could literally just reopen their old clients and the chain would reorg back to the longest chain on that version. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 22:52:28
That isn't a price graph. No matter how many times it's posted as a price graph that magically promises your bitcoin will be worth more soon. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:05:15
It's weird how the story changed on how much was invested in VC. 
Like the claim for ages last year was that 2015 would be the year with 1 billion dollars of investment but after that failed spectacularly people tried to change the claim to "1 billion dollars over 7 years" which is not actually a thing that actually happened. Bitcoin has not actually gotten even a single billion dollars in investment yet, even with those moved goal posts. It's still over 50 million dollars short of that goal. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:12:43
The lesson is that bitcoin will do the same thing it always does when pretending it's like the internet: Ignore the fact that IP changes need hardware changes while bitcoin is just a regular old program and no one needs to design or install new switches or wires or anything. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 00:45:06
This sounds more like a pitch for a scam or a religion than anything legitimate. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:37:44
It's suddenly more important than ever to decide who has what authority in the bitcoin power structure now that for the first time there is decisions that aren't being agreed on by everyone.
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:26:08
You don't think it's weird that the guy who gave himself a crazy title is also a guy who wants to pretend like he owns and controls bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-01-04 14:31:25
I feel like 99% of the people jerking off about how rich kenya is going to make them via bitcoin couldn't even point to kenya on a map, let alone describe how kenya would be helped by bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-01 22:12:11
It's sexy because it lets you pretend everything is fine and there is no problems, when at BEST there is two pools that control 51% of bitcoin instead of there being one pools. So decentralized!
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:44:58
It's not free money, it could go down as much as it could go up, lots of people put €1000 into bitcoin and only have 800, 500 or even 250 now. Many more people lost or had their coins stolen and have zero now. It's gambling. 
The number of people that bought bitcoin for 4 cents and are now millionaires is a teeny tiny number and even most of them could never have actually cashed out at the height even if they had wanted to. The number of actual people made rich by bitcoin is not that high and generally can't be verified to even be anyone with just some vague hand waving "they HAVE to be out there!" 
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:26:59

It solves a problem few people have and is ideologically appealing only if you hold an ideological position that only a fraction of a fraction of people hold. As a consumer product it's worse than existing products. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 00:24:00
To answer your last question: It can't, blocks come every ten minutes on average and there is just a trust based convention in the bitcoin community that as soon as you send a transaction that it's good enough to trust. This usually is fine but someday will bite someone in the ass quite hard. (at which point everyone will pretend they always said it was a bad idea to trust people like that)
@_date: 2016-01-05 12:22:54
news flash: bitcoin has been on the cover of time, on the daily show, in dozens of movies, in law and order and on the simpsons twice. The excuse that it's some unknown thing is just an excuse at this point.

Yeah, bitcoin used to have a trick where you could give yourself 184 billion valid bitcoin and that could be reintroduced without a hard fork. 
The parts of bitcoin that are limited with cryptography are very very very specific, most of it is just regular old programming that can be changed with any agreement to change it.

Sorry bro, luke-jr fucked this all up for you since he filled a lot of the early blockchain with a TON of religious prayers and stuff.
