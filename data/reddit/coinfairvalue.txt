So I am sure you have understood I am not using anything like earning to value Bitcoin. Talking about earnings doesn't make any sense in currencies. Just read the theory and learn how it is calculated.
Making an economic theory and creating a website such as CoinFairValue takes an incredible amount of effort. Discrediting unconstructively is just a matter of a couple of minutes ;)

Please, do not freak out because Bitcoin's fair value shows lower than its price. CoinFairValue does not add speculation to fair value. Fair value, as calculated in the site, is based on current usage, and not on expectations. All coins' fair values are calculated using the exact same criteria and formula.

Then the problem is you haven't read the learning section. The model does not have anything to do with earnings. The fact that there is an equivalent P/E ratio in the website is a convenience for fundamental investors more used to stocks. The underlying ratio is P/FV. The P/E ratio is just 15*P/FV, and the explanation for this, as stated in the website is:
"The Price to Earnings Ratio Equivalent is just the P/FV Ratio multiplied by 15. 15 is the average value of the Price to Earnings Ratio in the S&amp;P500 with data since 1900. It is, therefore, considered a neutral value in fundamental investing. By multiplying P/FV by 15, one obtains a value that can be directly compared with stocks."
"How the Price to Fair Value Ratio is to be interpreted and how does it relate to the Price to Earnings Ratio of stocks?
The Price to Fair Value Ratio is the simplest yet powerful fundamental investor metric. It does not have units, and what it measures is the number of times the market thinks the usage of the currency is going to increase / decrease in the discounted future. A P/FV equal to 1 means the market thinks the currency is neither going to increase nor decrease its usage in the discounted future. A value below 1 might represent an opportunity to buy cheap, whereas a value above 1 might represent an overpriced investment. All this depend on the speculation factor the investor wants to apply. Remember that at coinfairvalue.com we do not speculate.
The P/FV Ratio resembles the famous P/E Ratio that was popularized by Benjamin Graham and applies to stocks. Price to Earnings differ from Price to Fair Value in that the fair value of currencies is calculated differently from the fair value of stocks. Stocks are a future promise on cash flows whereas currencies are a tool for trading value. A neutral (zero-growth) discount of cash flows to perpetuity, for a company with an average Debt to Equity Ratio, yields a P/E Ratio of approximately 15. 15 is to stocks what 1 is to currencies. Thus, multiplying P/FV by 15, we get a P/E Equivalent Ratio for currencies.
The P/E Equivalent Ratio is very convenient for the typical stock market fundamental investor."

Understand the model, then comment constructively. There is a learning section in the website, check it out ;)

u/cheesburgerdude I had no idea whatsoever about the stress test. I just saw BCH's P/FV ratio very low and I thought it would be a good idea letting the BCH community know. CoinFairValue is very new (less than two months) and I have just started promoting it.
With regards to the algorithm, everything done is explained in the website. And the criteria is exactly the same for all the coins (wouldn't be fair otherwise). In a few months there will be a new feature: the fair value calculator. Investors will be able to set their own hypotheses on every issue of the Fair Value theory.
I am being honest and I am trying my best to deliver the best fair value I can and the best fundamental investing tools I can give. I am open to any suggestions. Indeed I invite anyone who wants to join r/CoinFairValue and discuss whatever they want.

Read the investor warnings for Bitcoin Cash.

I also have the option to use resetting moving averages when a number of subsequent outliers is detected. But that would abruptly change some fair values and it is not a good idea when you have users already used to the current algorithm IMO. Also, it would make it harder to understand for the average user. Anyways I can consider it if I get enough requests for the feature :)

You are still not getting it. Just ignore the P/E equivalent ratio column. Stick to the P/FV column. They carry the same information and P/FV is the actual source.

And please, if you are going to discredit it, read the learning section and be constructive in your arguments. Insulting just serves as a means to detect where intelligence is missing ;)

I took it down a while ago and got people complaining that they liked the column because they were used to seeing 15 as a neutral value. So I added it again.
The column does not add information at all, but I understand stock investors who see a value of 15 and think: ok, neither undervalued, nor overvalued. And that is the purpose of the column: familiarity.

Have you read the theory? What is your knowledge in finance and economics? When you say "volume" what exactly do you mean? Fair value is not only about one variable. Everything, even the P/E ratio EQUIVALENT, is explained in the website. And what do you mean by E? Currencies do not have earnings, that is why P/E ratio is not an actual P/E ratio, is an equivalent P/E ratio.
Do not try to look smart when you are just writing random stuff which do not make sense at all. Go trolling somewhere else.

I understand your concerns. I am the first one to dislike these stress tests. They have an impact in the basket average value, but because I use a 1-year MA for that -normal currency users don't change their behaviour very often-, the negative effect will come in some months. Those currencies whose FV has outerperformed thanks to a stress test will probably be severely punished after some months. That is why an investor warning is needed here. I thank you for comenting on this issue.

We are going to add a specific investor warning in BCH tomorrow.
