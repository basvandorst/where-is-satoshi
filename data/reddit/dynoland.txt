People think this is a scam because they want to 'make it a profit', but it's not profitable by itself. You can buy foreign currency and wait its price to go higher, but it may go lower.
They have to understand that bitcoin is money. And that if they want to make more money from it, they'll have to WORK for it, or invest it in the right projects, accepting the risk.
The rest is gambling. Can't hate casinos if you know the rules.
And they don't understand Bitcoin, the protocol. If only they understand how it works, it'll be a massive mind blowing. But we are getting there.

Hello Pastecoin!
I sent a message to support on the page in my account, are you checking them?
Or maybe it never went through? :x
Thank you!

I don't care about how bad Coinbase is, I don't care if they are being 'dishonest' by calling out security flaws on your system, I don't care about them. It's completely independent if someone choses their service. We can use Blockchain and Coinbase at our own risk.
Explain the securities issues, fix them, warn people about them. Make it virtually impossible to have our bitcoins stolen, and then talk about whatever you want.
But cut the drama, I don't care if it is Hitler who is blaming someone about something if the blamed one is really to blame. Telling me how bad Hitler is won't change a single bit of what he says, and proving him wrong is made with facts about your own improvements, not by blaming him for his crimes.
