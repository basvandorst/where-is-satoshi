Also BTC has missing coins. 
Gonna go on a ramble. The actual supply and thus market cap is lower in reality. Also, only 4-6 billion dollars have been invested in the whole crypto field. Every dollar gone into BTC multiples into $25 of gain in market cap. That is because the dynamics are different with something like BTC or gold that have marketcaps. So if the US alone went fully Bitcoin, at the current time, that would mean BTC would be $500 trillion of market cap vs $20 trillion in US dollar. That is not even including the lost coins. If a third of all coins are surely lost, than a marketcap of 665 trillion dollars is feasible. But there is other cryptos and gold. It is also worth mentioning that the dollars invested earlier have inflated the 25x figure a little bit too.
Oh, wait, we're only taking US here also.

That comment was serious advice though. BTC has bakkt and cme that create more BTC supply. I still believe though BTC will go up, and 7x is very doable

I wish I got in then, I mined 1 BTC every three days way back on a gaming PC rip. Didn't understand economics of it, just basic tech stuff. So I spend it. Not sold, but used it. Also, I looked at what if I mined Ethereum for 2 years and never sold till top on my single r9 290, and it was like 400k in profits iirc. Double rip me. People are crazy when they think BTC can't do more than 5x or 10x. They are dumb because people don't see losses and gains the same way. A gain of 50x will be less positive than the negativity of a 85% pull back. People are also impatient.

Yep. You are definitely delusional. Can't read charts, can't even read English either.
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:27:53
7x over what it is right now. Nothing crazy BTC had never done yet
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:00:52
Imagine being so delusional you couldn't even look at a chart and see the hundreds of times Bitcoin has done a 7x
@_date: 2019-10-21 23:17:45
Just sell right now if Bitcoin isn't going up. If you think it won't go up 7x, than the risk of holding is too high, go sell and buy another asset. Serious advice
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:16:18
Well it's a hyperbole, but it has done that SO many times. You're still the delusional one for thinking that it isn't a part of the norm. BTC is voilitile. Anyone that has said, it's can't go higher or lower than xyz has always gotten rekt.

Same lol. Was mining 1 BTC every three days. Never held. : (

It goes up before it, and we should see more price action as it nears. But then it drops once the halvening hype sets in really near the date of halvening. Then price drops hard and goes sideways for sometime until it really goes off. It takes a few months to realize gains from halvening. That is historically

I agree, but futures is cash settled. Bakkt is Bitcoin settled. So at the least some supply will be needed to be taken up to use bakkt

I mean it can't be worse than tether
@_date: 2019-09-10 02:13:11
But why is ripple shit?
@_date: 2019-09-09 23:24:49
Can you please explain to me, just curious
@_date: 2019-09-10 00:05:59
Ok, I know that XRP is sort of centralized, and the company ripple is centralized, but what is so bad about it? It's for banks anyways. I don't own any, just doing some research, see alot of people angry at it.
