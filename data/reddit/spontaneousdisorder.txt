The price has very little to do with fundamentals. You have wild swings based on self reinforced crowd behaviour. (ie investors buy, price goes up, more investors join in etc), and vice versa.

They use gox for convenience. If your wallet never sees the internet you will be safe from almost all attacks, but you could still forget password, loose backups, make an error copying wallet addresses. There are various guides around the net for offline storage (google them), just be sensible and double check everything you do!

It could be better explained. Is the idea to create new currencies within the current chain? Then 1 satoshi could equal some new unit?
Seems better to put this stuff in a new chain because the bitcoin devs are not likely to create the ability to colour existing coins and keep them separate.
@_date: 2012-10-03 20:39:47
Its possible to use a seperate partition/usb/live cd. It is a pain in the ass though for someone not used to Linux. But totally worth working it out. Then once you do accumulate more coins your prepared to store them safely. If your trying to figure things out on the fly it just makes the chance of making a silly mistake greater.

I think Tihan Seale owns bitcoinica (tseale on forum) Intersango and Tihan exchanged some shares in each others company when intersango took over operation of bitcoinica. They also took over the claims process but now they want nothing to do with it.
Understand Bitcoinica was very insecure being develeped by a 17 year old. A recent forum thread by aurumexchange and mtgox points the evidence strongly toward Zhoutong in the latest hack... but he has his story.
Intersango has never had security problems but they have regular problems with bank accounts etc.

Golds uses are quite limited. Most is used for jewellery, but then lots of material would be good for jewellery. gold is favoured because it is rare. When aluminium was difficult to make it was also used in jewellery. In any case bitcoin has useful properties like gold, but economic value itself is subjective.

I heard about and started buying in late 2011. Bought most (65BTC) in early 2012 but stopped when Intersango closed because there was nowhere easy to buy.
I sold them 2 weeks before the spring 2013 top over a few days and sold a a cacasius coin mid way through the fall 2013 bubble.
Overall I'm happy, I was really interested in everything Bitcoin until prices got carried away and will get back into it when there is a financial crisis and I need to diversify my savings.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:42:14
I dunno, people have been so cavalier expressing their opinion that Bitcoin can only go up, many people would have dumped all their savings at the top full of confidence, even borrowed.

I would say its a great technology to learn about as a hobby, and something great to be into for when the current system breaks down. I mean money today means just being able to do a transfer between 2 people over long distance quickly. The current system is so unstable and interlinked, not long ago Greece had to buy oil from Iran because no-one would accept their letters of credit. When money systems break down people look for alternatives, in Zimbebwe they use the dollar now, but in the west cash and gold are no good. We need digital exchange. Bitcoin is the only alternative. /RANT

Buying that amount of coin would move the price and buy up all the supply of coin on the market. For instance if you bought $20m worth on Gox the price of bitcoin would go above $1500. BTC coin is very thinly traded at them moment which is part of the reason it can achieve a $8bn market cap.

Open Transactions could solve this, I think the developer is making a way for the coins to be "bailed in" to a number of OT servers with multisig transaction. The coins would be transacted instantly and *anonymously* within the OT system. It seems like a big deal but also its quite difficult to follow where OT is at right now so I don't know how close this is to being realized.

Everyone loves instability when they *make* money (on paper). Yes I love bitcoin, I made out with 25X my investment earlier this year. I mostly held on so long because I love the currency but sold because I saw the developing blowoff and over-bullishness.  
Bitcoin is overvalued and hyper-volatile. It WILL crash. I can't wait for it to be worth buying again because I' not willing to loose money on something for sentimental reasons. (well ok apart from my remaining casacius coin! :)

Bitcoin is in a bubble, the same as dozens of bubbles before it. Its the people who disagree who are arguing "this time its different." Bitcoin is an *asset* not magical pixie dust, it *will* crash. Dot coms did too but the internet is doing pretty good, the speculators, not so much.

As long as you have the mathematical abilities of a 12 year old, then whether you insist on using mBTC or BTC, I really couldn't give a crap.
@_date: 2013-02-03 18:27:33
Saving and investing is in fact one of the most helpfull and important things you can do in a marketplace. Because BTC is volatile just dollar cost average what you can afford. And if the price goes down significantly ramp up your purchases and vice versa. Also the market isn't charity, just buy and sell in bitcoins when it suits you.

US M3 is about $15tn, total dollar debt may be 50 or 60tn. The US economy is $15tn, *and* the dollar is the global reserve currency.
Bitcoins market cap is $3bn. Based on what exactly? That the next sucker will pay inflated prices for something that [no-one is selling.](

This. In 2013 and especially recently people can't separate the revolutionary potential and the price. To me that indicates there are too many niave investors and the market will make sure it wipes them out first. This is just basic market behavior.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:50:23
Dude I've been waiting for 3 whole days for this to crash - since I sold out. And I'm super bearish.
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:05:57
Bitcoin prices are volatile, but they don't reliably always go up. It might not look like that now but prices regularly double and halve. You could just as easily dump $1000 on BTC now, see the price hit $110 then crash to $10 later this year. DCA'ing lessens that risk.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:53:54
Probably. I'm guessing these systems can be very complex, and to change to a new one might be difficult and risky. Sometimes its easier to stick with what you know.
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:25:36
Totally looks like a blowoff top, could spike up real fast. There are people on the forums convinced bitcoin will never even correct again.

No! You don't have enough savings to be taking any risks. Put your cash somewhere safe and wait until everyone hates bitcoin again if you want to buy some. Edit&gt;sorry that sounds a bit harsh hehe!

I'm more dissapointed in the way they ramp the price in every press release and blame crashes on the site going down. IMO they should remain neutral WRT market price and not keep trying to convince suckers their bitcoin investment is sound.
@_date: 2013-02-09 21:48:53
And how do you do that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:03:21
Hey you guise, this is quite normal, its just the large hands trying to shake out the weak hand so they can buy cheap coins. This is when you have to buy moar because bitcoin will be 10x higher in 2 months you will be kicking yourself for selling.

How to go mainstream? Do away with fiat banking alltogether, bitcoin is simple compared to the fiat system. And the new payment system coming will make it even simpler.

Hell yeah! The bursting of the last bubble only took 5 months.

Bitcoin doesn't have valuations so the only ways I can think of to indicate overbuying is spiking (a common bitcoin habit before a drop) and optimistic sentiment.

@_date: 2013-01-24 18:33:49
Its difficult to objectively value bitcoin. I'd say spikes upward and overly bullish sentiment indicate people should be cautious when buying.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:33:37
Eh I sold my coins at around this level (but w/ 20% premium on localbitcoin. and 25x gain on when I bought.) Don't regret it, it may top a lot higher in price but not much in terms of time.

The consensus is a very dangerous place to be in a financial market. Ordinarily I downvote snarky comments but in these times its warranted. Don't invest in bitcoin right now unless your happy with seeing your investment go way down, and have to wait it out. I bought a load of coin a year ago, and I'm not selling at this price, because of the long term potential, but I'm not going to delude myself that the market is a sure thing. In general if you want some then dollar cost average.

Upvote this.... to the moon.  
Technicals are appalling right now. The asks on gox have [collapsed to absurd levels]( chart). And the volume is awful compared to the solid volume in spring.
@_date: 2013-02-12 20:47:39
That would appear to be now IMO. Although such sentiments can't pinpoint a top, the price could still blowoff 2x, 3x or 4x. Yes some people are saying its overvalued but overall sentiment is elevated and 180 degrees from where it was in October 2011. My 2 Bitcents.

That is exactly what you expect at a major top. At $2 they thought bitcoin was a joke.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:42:38
Yeah its the final blowoff. Exact same thing happened in april. Went vertical and crashed. Volume on Gox is very low and the price is rocketing because only 5k in asks.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:58:58
Ok cuntface, it will top this month, probably below $1000 and crash hard. I have a record you see, do you?
@_date: 2013-01-01 21:33:53
Sorry they have yield to compensate for inflation and risk. These days bond don't even compensate for those risks. I'd rather have cash bills than some fancy synthetic financial instrument thats gonna blow up again in a couple of years.
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:17:37
If a trade went wrong I would message the other person ASAP on LBC so there is a clear record of everything that happens and it looks like you are a responsible trader. I did even this when selling via bank transfer and the transfer was slow.
@_date: 2013-01-22 16:08:14
I always underestimate rallies, but one thing I've learnt is its better to buy into weakness than chase a rally. Best to wait until the kind of correction we saw in August.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:04:54
There's still plenty of time to loose a lot of money ;)
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:40:22
Don't people learn? Bitcoin is rising vertically again, the last time this happened bitcoin crashed 80% in a few hours. The asks on Gox are down to below where they were at the peak, meaning the supply has dried up. I sold out a week before the first peak, no way would I touch it now. And standard disclaimer: yes the price could blowoff to 500 even $1000 (unlikely) but the crash will be so fast you have to be nimble to get out. I was selling for 2.5 days straight to get rid of them fast last time.
