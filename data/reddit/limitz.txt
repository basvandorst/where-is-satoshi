How wouldn't it? I'm of the opinion that there is no such thing as "too big to fail", and Gox has been directly responsible for previous sell-off's in the past. Gox falling would just be a market correction for an otherwise rotten exchange.
As of now there are over 40,000 BTC stuck, and increasing every day. The delays to get fiat out of Gox are ridiculously long with many users not getting their money for months, and on top of that, users are reporting double-spending left and right.
Wouldn't mind Gox falling at all actually. They seem to be criminally defrauding people at worst, and have structural problems at best.

I don't think the Japanese government even recognizes BTC as a currency. Legally, if Karpeles did steal BTC, I'm not sure what charges that would bring. I don't think it's illegal to steal BTC, and very few cases of virtual crime have been prosecuted.
Perhaps the people that were selling goxBTC for fiat at bargain prices weren't that stupid. They'll have a lot more legal leverage holding fiat than what is legally considered monopoly money.

BTC was never listed as a liability in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy fillings. Only the fiat liabilities ($68M) and assets ($38M). To the government of Japan, BTC is no different than Monopoly money. I'm not sure if there is even legal precedent of cyberfraud in Japan (ie: scamming someone in WoW). BTC is certainly not recognized as a currency in Japan:
Legally, I think Karpeles can do what he pleases with the BTC.
