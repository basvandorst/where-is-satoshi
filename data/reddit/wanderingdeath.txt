Great start! I really dig the focus on news and social aspects being built right in! A one-stop crypto app is exactly what I've been looking for. I would take a look at how the Delta app structures its portfolio management and entries. IMHO they do it the best so far. Users need to be able to set which exchange their holdings were purchased from, pairing that were traded, auto deductions from BTC when its used in a trade, time/date stamp for reference, a notes section per entry, and MOST importantly a way to factor the fees in! Why Blockfolio doesn't do this yet is beyond me. Fees add up over time plain and simple. Whether they be exchange fees or transfer fees we need ways of tracking that if a portfolio feature is to be taken seriously. 
Another handy feature from Delta would be the $0.00 cost that can be entered if you did not actually buy said coin. Ex. Gifted coins, earned coins, mined coins (thats a big one)! Those all need to be entered as non purchased $0.00 additions to your portfolio, again if the portfolio is to be taken seriously. 
Can you explain how the portfolio entries are stored? Is everyone's info sitting on a server or is it staying local?
I also echo the request for multiple portfolios. I'd love to be able to bounce between several portfolios, ex. one for Mining, one for the Long HODL, you get the idea. 
Hope this helps!
