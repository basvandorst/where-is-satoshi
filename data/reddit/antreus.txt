That's a good one I sent him some too.

This is great but make sure you incorporate the tax rate and shipping :P

This sums it for for me marci003. I personally got interested in BitCoin as a fun hobby, which could potentially have sociopolitical ramifications. A way to engage and experiment with a simulated scarcity model, that is and isn't fiat and gold all at the same time.
I cannot wait to see what this community comes up with in regards to infrastructure, commerce, and job opportunities.
There's a lot of loyal backers, myself included, who as a hobby wish for the system to just succeed. We'll be the ones ensuring that the network is accessible. I don't plan on taking my ASIC down simply because its not profitable anymore in the near future. You can count on that - dattebayo! :)

If anyone remembers  Zhou Xiaochuan's speech during the financial crisis in 2008, outlined the problem rather succinctly.
He points to how Keynes was quite prescient. Zhou meanwhile is asking for the SDRs to become the basis of the supranational currency, one that is outside of U.S direct control.
I saw Bitcoin's potential based on these three things alone, after a modest bit of research over the years on the financial crisis as it was unfolding.

Good for them..

I logged into my account and I didn't get a dialogue box or any sort of indicator on my account that I needed to confirm anything, whatsoever.. even though I received the doomsay e-mail confirm or be removed from pre-order, seriously ftw?
It says my orders are processing, nothing new here, it's been like that for months.

Bitcoin feels a bit like a speculative commodity right now, the volatility, and well the scarcity. I hope that people start using the money to create businesses and jobs, otherwise how will people seek to replace national currencies with Bitcoin transactions? I'd love to be paid in bitcoin and I've recently purchased an ASIC as a side-hobby with a friend, but we have little purchasing power, so we have to save. Hopefully, people with a lot of capital start spending, spending, not hoarding.
There needs to be some labour involved.. that's one thing we learned from Keynes. We need to put people to work, otherwise the capital just sits there, and we'll just see another bubble and mass-selloff.

Probably not, but we do have bitcoinmillionaire.

Yea, I just thought of this too, and my mind was blown. Early adopters have huge financial clout.  A lot of tech savvy folk from humble means have now a lot of money they didn't have. Hobbyists are great :)
I don't agree with your opine on the USD convertibility. I don't think Bitcoin has the supply chains the USD has, that's why its converted, which can have the affect of increasing bitcoin supply chains, by redirecting capital to developing them. You convert to another currency based on accessibility to certain resources, no? Last time I checked you can't pay your rent and utilities with bitcoin.
What I find interesting about supply chains is that you could have a functional tech savvy-friendly market whose currency is bitcoin based. Computer things for computers and things computer companies need for selling computers :)
Also, Bitcoin will last as long as governments allow it to.. my opinion, but there's legal precedent for it. I'm fine with keeping it as a niche currency.

Time to jump on the bitcointip train :) Toot-toot.

The bancor is very farsighted on behalf of Keynes. Keynes wasn't Keynesian, that came after the man.
We can learn a lot about bitcoin by understanding our current problems inherent in the Trifflin Dilemma as pointed out by Zhou in 2009, feel free to Wiki this.

Wow thanks for sharing that story Red_Eye_Insomniac. That's pretty much the story of my life, too. Except the cashing out my bitcoins. Kudos to you on your farsightedness, despite the liberal arts set-back. And kudos to you also for the determination to go back to school in a STEM field after coming to terms with the liberal arts blunder.
Thanks for the post :)
