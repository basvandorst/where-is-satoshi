This clears things up a lot. So at any given time, all mining nodes work on timestamping almost the same set of transactions, ie. if all of them somehow got the reward, their produced blocks would be similar, just with a different order of the actual transactions?

If for example, I want to verify that a person sent me the money within the final deadline period, which was yesterday, how could I do that in a Bitcoin transaction? Keep in mind that he/she could have paid at around the change of the day, so to know _when_ the transaction was made with a down-to-second precision is important in this case.
I guess I can't rely on the time the block was mined. If there is no concept of "transaction timestamp" then what's the way to do this?

Thanks for all the helpful answers. However some of my question still remain unanswered. I'm repeating them here:
Q2: The blockchain is a timestamp server. What does it timestamps? Transactions or blocks?
Q3: If the blockchain doesn't timestamp transactions, then who declares what time the transaction was initiated? Don't they have to be timestamped?

So it's the fees that miners win? I thought it was new tokens that were being rewarded. Or is it a combination?

This "what" confuses me. I thought they could just decide "how" to include them, meaning in what order. Is that what you meant?
Or they can also decide which transactions to include and which not? If that's correct, does this mean there's a pool of transactions that miners can work on and they decide which of them to work on? If so, doesn't this mean that miners could always prefer highest-fee transactions, resulting in low-fee transactions being delayed and left behind?

So we don't know _when_ a transaction happened?
