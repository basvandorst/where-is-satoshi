I'm holding as well and get more while it's still under 15k.

actually no the coin price dropped by 3 percent today, might go down more?

Brilliant interview if you ask me. Very good analysis on his previous investments. Right on point. Very insightful indeed.

been checking on coinmarketcap and the price seems to be far off what's displaying on kraken or coinbase

You just need to be patient and be not too greedy at the same time. Even if you're just a small trader you can wait for the right price timing and you will gain.

I agree with her, it should not get banned. But what she said about her views on crypto holds true. Especially about putting regulations in place.

I totally agree with the happy hormones! lol. But seriously, this is always how the bitcoin economy works. It's driven by supply and demand.

You're right! I think the price trend will continue to rise.

the coin price of bitcoin seems to have found support at these levels. IMO we're looking good (price wise) for March 
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:47:42
I agree. Keep a low profile and you'll be fine. No reason for unnecessary attention to yourself.

Makes me wonder how the ECB's current QE program will impact on the future value of people's euro savings. 
Sometimes people should seriously consider diversifying their savings into crypto and gold - at least 10 to 30 percent. So as to maintain value over time.

Rephrase it: when every bitcoin is worth 1 million usd, there will be somewhere near to 21 million millionaires!

All the progress with lightning network really get's me confident and excited about the future of bitcoin. We're building the first, and most important layers right now - these are the important moments that we'll be talking about 20 years down the road! IMO this is somewhat akin to the TCP/IP stage of internet adoption in the 80s and 90s.

Well done bisq. Best decentralized exchange. No anti-palindromite also

IMO the BBC has done a good simplification for the average non tech person to understand. I find that in recent times, the main stream media are actually starting to produce well-explained articles with sold technical understanding of events (eg with last year's cryptolocker wave)

Congratulations are in order for the Swiss for making this bold step. Well, they have grown by the same acceptance of pioneering technology and financial stability.

It's good start and hopefully other companies will follow suit. It'll be much more convenient for some folks if they adopt this kind of payment system.

I agree with you here, there's just so much going on - yet even sometimes things stand out at these price levels (expect the unexpected is how i do it )
