here's the problem with your idea: 
Content providers cannot distinguish a user that was not able to view the ad content because of an ad-blocking measure (browser extension, hosts file, firewall), from a legitimate delivery failure (network latency, advertising server failure, etc). 
Add to this failure agnosticism the fact that advertising companies are notoriously unreliable, from a technical standpoint, content creators are faced with a dilemma - stop all users that can't load an ad from viewing the content, or allow some users to view the content that can't load an ad. 
Do you want to create a negative impression to the users that will ultimately at some point not be able to view an ad (most likely due to ad server issues), an impression that will likely result in fewer return visits? Or would you rather realize that there will always be a certain amount of viewers that are not able to add to your revenue stream, but ensure that all are able to enjoy your content, hopefully fostering a return audience in both the ad-blockers and the ad-viewers?

for me, as a web developer, my questions are more in the form of security... what's to keep someone from pushing an "update" to the blockchain, and serving malicious code?
Without a centralized server, how does anyone know what the "official" html/js/whatever code is? How easy would this be to manipulate?

what you're describing is a one-way path. "spend" a coin in this context means transmit from one key (wallet) to another key (wallet). There is nothing inherent in the transaction that requires any type of reciprocity, from a technological standpoint. (at least from what I understand)
Meaning that what I'm talking about is more an agreement among exchanges / markets / whoever that they will not honor "tainted" coins.

or, they could change their business model and create a paywall. 
seems like a silly game of pass the buck.

~~I think you need to have "verify" at the end of your post, like so:~~

What's even crazier is that without those, we wouldn't have electronic payments.

oh man wouldn't it be nice if the real world was as simple as the one in your head. We'd have so few problems!
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:54:51
from a technological standpoint, what you describe is only made difficult by the amount of computational power available to calculate the destinations of the fragments of coins. I can't imagine this being difficult unless the transaction was spread out over an exponential number of paths.
But more importantly, while it may take computational power and time, once the funds are coalesced into a destination wallet, the difficulty in calculation stopped. So unless the transactions could be made continuously faster than the path could be calculated, eventually, the fogged coins could be traced.

don't worry, in about 100 years or so, you won't have to worry about unemployment as much, seeing as we'll have wrecked our environment and probably trigger an extinction event. 
Yay consumerism!

you are a bad person. I doubt you can understand this from your perspective, but what you are doing is objectively, morally wrong. 
You may not think this makes you a bad person, but it does. And I'd bet you probably don't care.

So what is the popular opinion on how to deal with coin theft / fraud? Is it generally considered a necessary evil?
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:47:52
Yea, you never need protection until you need it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:13:55
well, but isn't that the point of a currency that records transactions?
Or is the only reason the blockchain exists is to make sure coins aren't double spent?

OMG what would we do if we weren't able to watch cat videos on the internet?????????? YOU MEAN WE'D ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT REAL CATS????? OOOOOHHHHHHH THE HORROR!!!!!111one!eleven

please forgive me if I have a fundamental flaw in my understanding of how bitcoin works, but if the funds were hacked or stolen, there is a record in the blockchain where those funds went to. Since all transactions are recorded into the blockchain, it would be theoretically possible for those coins to be tracked, no matter how they changed hands, and then it would be possible for markets or exchanges to share a "blacklist" as such, so that they would not accept any transactions from wallets that contain or have contained any of the stolen/hacked coins. This is in theory, possible, right? It would just take the work of talented individuals to code and the agreement of the various markets/exchanges to enforce this, correct?

as a web developer, I can assure you that from a technical standpoint, you cannot be sure that what you're detecting is in fact adblock, or a failure with the ad server.
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:35:06
Just so you know, most mid to large businesses that are primarily online have fraud divisions specifically to deal with mitigating charge-back fraud and other types of fraud. 
I think it's a cool thing to do, though, to incentivise bitcoin purchasing.

Well, sure, it's as simple as never spending any coins. 
There is no way to engage in any spending, virtual or otherwise, where there is 0 risk of fraud or theft. What you are basically promoting is the idea that you *should* know better, and you *should* be protected by abstract concepts as community trust and the like. 
However, you started the conversation stating the entirety of theft and fraud occurs only to incompetent individuals, and then you switch your position ever so slightly by saying that you have to use decentralized exchanges - completely ignoring the fact that theft and fraud can occur to these systems regardless of the level of competency of the users.
Everything is secure until it is not, and so then every individual is competent until they are not.

Simple has bill pay, in the form of sending physical checks to all billpay recipients. afaik, they do not have a direct payment system to send bill payments the way BoA has, and neither do they have e-bills or anything like that.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:25:39
yea, I don't like that kind of policy. Because if the check was lost in the mail, or the payee doesn't cash it for whatever reason, then you have to wait 90 days for the funds to become available again.

I tried simple as my main account for about 6 months or so. I ended up going back to USAA, although i still have my simple account in case i need it. For me personally, it was much more convenient to use USAA, as i have several accounts with different companies (savings, credit cards, etc), and USAA was able to provide a single point of information for all of them. 
Also, I found simple's way of billpay to be annoying, they take the money out of your account to send the check, rather than issuing a check and when it is deposited, then it is withdrawn. This is more to do with Simple being a service and not a bank, so they can't provide all the perks a regular bank can. 
However, I think Simple is pretty ideal for someone with less banking requirements and just needs the basic services that checking accounts provide.

I could be wrong here, but I thought the origins of the meme involved the misspelling of dog as "doge" being read by a computer text-to-speech program, which sounded more like "doj" 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:37:12
Yea, I've been super happy with them. I tried Simple more out of curiosity and that early-adoption itch i need to scratch every so often rather than any dissatisfaction with USAA.
