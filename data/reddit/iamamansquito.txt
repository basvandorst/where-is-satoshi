Are the South Korean officials done buying low yet?  I need the price back up.

As a Libertarian And a hodlr I say keep it closed.

I sold some at 16500.   Best I can do I still work and can’t watch this craziness all day.

You should really be a life coach

Or THEY will paralyze us on exchanges while THEY dump a metric shit ton of coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:51
I mean ya.  If it dips enough I will buy some but this feels different 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:27:35
I got a bad feeling about this
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:06
Does anyone else feel like the end is nigh ?
I’m sure this has been said before but I see a lot of activity today.  Nothing like we have seen.  
I was happy to cash out at 16.5k before the exchanges locked up.

This is how Skynet is built.  Small digital wars between greedy hackers.  They develop AI to change the game.  Someone accidentally gets it right then everyone dies before we know what went wrong.

Mr. President, Will you kindly log off Reddit and focus on running the country.

Well....

You could probably start a mining pool just to attempt to crack the encryption.

Here you on that.  Let’s get a pic once you get something!

Unless your net worth is over one million dollars you shouldn’t by a new car.  
Sounds silly I know but nothing (with the exception of BCH) depreciates in value as much as a new car. 
Buying a new car is like buying Bitcoin on the peaks instead of the dips.  
If you were to buy that Tesla for 200k who would give you that much for it a week after you buy it?  No one right?  Because they could just get a new one.  Doubt you could sell it for more than 150k
Edit:  Ok new cars aren’t terrible deals but they are horrible if you finance.  Let’s face it if your on this sub you probably don’t plan to finance you new ride.  Stay away from leases.  If you know basic car maintenance used is much much cheaper.

I remember seeing all the posts back at 5000-7500 range saying bye to the community and cashing out.  
I don’t question 40000 by this time next year.  Maybe more.  
Congratulations to all and hodl!

Open a Coinbase account.  Then you can buy in USD.  It will charge a small fee then give you an equal amount of BTC for your dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:21:06
Just spoke to someone yesterday saying they can’t afford a coin now that it is so high.  I showed him my purchase history and helped him open an account.  
People on the outside feel left out.  We need to inform them just as you said.  It’s only the beginning.

It made me want to be an awful person.  Knowing I could easily throw up a website and some amazing investment or world changing plan for people to get behind.  Set that presale up and watch the Ether flow in.  
My wife reminded me I don't want to make my money that way.  Honestly though...people need to chill with the ICO thing.

When I first read what he said I was like "This guy has the power to drive the market either way.  What is the smartest move he could make?"  
Say it's a fraud and bottom out the price.  Then buy as much as you can.  
I think he knows he was late to the show for bitcoin and he fixed that.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:30:02
Exactly!  This guy shouldn't care about bitcoin in the slightest.  The only reason he had something to say about it is that either:
 A. He wants to get in on bitcoin at a good price because he missed the train
B: He sees bitcoin as a threat to banks.
I think thinking its more B but a little bit of both.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:10:02
It's like they want to press pause to get thier money together then they like okay bitcoin legal again...
