We all want to avoid that :p I'm not suggesting we throw our money at every random cause that comes our way &amp; blindly trust the random person behind it. 
I'm just kinda surprised that no one has suggested an escrow yet, everyone is paranoid about losing $$$ (rightly so) but no one has suggested a (very easy) solution yet.

"Between February and March of this year, the better part of $500 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen from the Mt. Gox and Flexcoin exchanges. The currency may have been based on the notion that, so long as more than 50 percent of all users were behaving legitimately, then the system was tremendously secure. Now, however, Bitcoin's reputation as a safe place to hold your money is gossamer-thin. Any large corporation would leave itself open to a huge amount of risk if it began to accept transactions that aren't approved by trusted servers, but instead by "the community at large."" 
Is he talking about a 51% attack here (I presume not so) or he is talking about the vulnerability in using only a few "trusted by the community" exchanges, or it there something else I'm missing?
"In just four months, the system has fallen from a high of $1,151 during the holiday season to under $500 yesterday. Imagine purchasing an item on Monday, but by the time the transaction cleared on Tuesday, the value of the payment had halved. Who do you think would pick up the bill for the lost cash?"
Apparently this guy has never heard of bitpay? 
This article is alright at points but it's got a very negative tone overall, it reminds me of the fearmongering articles of last year. 
"Bitcoin isn't currently accepted as a currency in the US, China, Russia or India." 
This statement is true but it leaves the reader with a negative impression, it implies that you can't spend it in any of those countries. 
The ponits about amazon are accurate I feel but I'd prefer the writer to have a bit more knowledge about bitcoin before doing a write up on it.

There's nothing wrong with people posting an article about China getting a bitcoin atm, that's quite releveant &amp; yes some people are gonna over react (To the moooon) but that's the nature of this game &amp; I feel like as a community the majortiy of us realize that this isn't the sort of news that drives the price to the moon.

I think the site was down or something? Cause it's working fine for me now. Compared to the other crashes in bitcoins history it'd be easy to feel like the sr one only happened in a matter of hours, the others were much more drawn out &amp; uncertain. It was definitely a great buying opportunity for those without fear, I remember a popular argument going around at the time was that sr supported such a large amount of the btc transactions everyday that if it went down, it'd take half the bitcoin economy with it but that was easily countered by looking at days sr was down &amp; matching it up with the charts, you could see that they weren't heavily correlated at all.

4 irrc. The crash of last summer $266&gt;&gt;&gt;$50 (Gox ddos) then it was the SR mini crash which only lasted like 2 days (Around October, can't remember the prices, maybe like $180&gt;&gt;&gt;$100 or so) After that it was the crash from ~$1100 to ~$700 (Bad China news) in ~January &amp; the most recent one as well. 
The severity of these crashes vary but they fall under what I'd call a crash, your defintion of crash may differ from mine. Also the months &amp; prices are very approximate &amp; the reasons oversimplified :P

Besides that there's a million different ways to say what he said, he follows on by talking all about bitcoin being used for illegal transactions, he wishes it could be used to buy legal stuff, etc, etc. Just trying to paint a negative picture of bitcoin overall. I'm not sure why he's doing this, he's a smart guy so I'm thinking he realizes that anything he says now will have a short lived impact, at best (Unless this is the start of a paypal campaign of shitting on bitcoin) I don't think bitcoin is that much of a worry for paypal now, that'd he'd make a public hit piece about it to attempt to influence mass opinion.

Does most of the fee really go to cc processors?

It definitely could be be fake, without a doubt. It's just, your comment reads like you're already biased from the start. Is this generally what handwriting experts look for when comparing people's handwriting? And if so how accurate are your assertions? Anyone can look at anyone's handwritten and pick out similarities but unless you're actually an expert in this field I wouldn't come in and declare this "clearly" fake. There's just something about this almost uber skeptical attitude that seems to be spread across most of reddit, it doesn't leave room for questioning matters more deeply and encourages the "Well this is the Internet, must've happened" auto dismissive response on anything that has a chance of being fake, rather than to actually look into a subject and use your own judgement to ascertain whether it's fake or not .

There's two alternate ways to do it but your phone has to be rooted for both. One uses an app called titanium backup &amp; the other you manually extract the credentials yourself. There's a guide here: 
No matter what backup rotue you choose be sure to store them in a secure location, I'd recommend creating a truecrypt volume on your pc or a truecrypt usb stick.
Rooting your phone isn't hard btw, if you type in "root "name of your phone" xda developers" you'll find a good guide &amp; lots of info about rooting, xda-developers is the go to site for this kinda stuff.

I think an important counter is to ridicule the war on terror whenever we can, around friends and family. For example, if you're watching the news and someone gets locked up for money laundering, point out that HSBC laundered billions for drug cartels and terrorists, and you can source that too, there's loads of articles. Just look for little bits of hypocrisy everywhere, so you might get an opportunity to use the factoid that 1 million civilians have died in the Iraq war, and you can source that too. Because once people realise the war on terror is fucking ridiculous, that play stops working.

In the past year there hasn't been much upward price movement, it's been mostly down &amp; sideways, with a few ups here and there. But aside from the price, it looks positive overall. Companies are continuing to invest in the technology heavily &amp; there hasn't been many (any?) large btc thefts this year (Someone else should confirm this though because I haven't been following it *too* closely for the past year)
There's an issue going on now with people disagreeing on block sizes but that'll get solved eventually because I think most of the devs are on the same page (Again don't quote me here &amp; do your own research into this!) One negative is that we do need to be able to reach consensus faster, this block size thing has been dragging on for a while now. 
Basically I'd say if you thought it was a good technology a year ago, there hasn't been anything that'd change your mind I don't think. Bitcoin has issues for sure (slow transaction time relative to big cc companies, some scalability issues, but these, i believe, can &amp; will be fixed in time.

I agree with the US's logic to ban him from entering the country, if their reasons are a combination of the following: 
-That many people who've revoked their citizenship decide to change their mind &amp; actually stay.
-He hasn't been a citizen of St.Kitts for very long, which would obviously makes him look extra sketchy to the US gov.
-Also him having a record definitely doesn't help.
I do, however, think it's fucked up seeing people think that the US has some moral authority over him for breaking a bullshit law in the past (The US &amp; morals do not belong in the same sentence, neither do most countries on this planet mind you) 
I also take issue with the people who think that it's perfectly fine to deny someone entry **automatically in every instance** once they've revoked their citizenship. (Which I don't think is the case here, seems like a combination of factors) 
No state should have that much control over someone's movement just because they revoked their citizenship. I have to think that people who do think that's fine are in some way experiencing Stockholm syndrome or are just rampant "patriots"

MrMakanoto I understand bitcoin, maybe it didn't sound like it from my post but I've been following it for a few years :p I was simply stating one downside that bitcoin has at the moment, maybe I didn't word my post correctly. What I meant was that if bitcoin hopes to be the burgeoning platform it knows it can be, scalability is one big issue facing it right now. It's transactions per second are little compared to the Mastercard &amp; visa. Don't get me wrong, I believe this is something bitcoin will get passed in the future, but the time frame of such could be something to consider if someone were considering investing. I also threw it in there just to try &amp; paint a more balanced picture, that yes it's an amazing technology but it's not without its risks, it's not fair to only give positives, just because I don't think scalability will be a problem in the future, doesn't mean somebody else won't. Too often bitcoin believers (believers in anything really) are all sunshine, roses &amp; circlejerk.

It really does depend on the use case. At this stage in bitcoins life cycle, it's faster (most of the time) for people to use cc's when paying for stuff in face to face situations. I'd like if someone else chimed in here  though because I don't know much about confirmation times and how the business' that are currently accepting bitcoin deal with it  
However if you were someone sending money home, btc is exactly what you want, it's got tiny fees &amp; it's fast. Also business' are incentivised to get consumers to use bitcoin because the more people that pay in btc, the more they save on cc fees, some of the savings of which can be passed down to the customer. 
A few benefits of using bitcoin are:  You're not supporting a corrupt banking system, you don't have to hand over your identity, date of birth, address, etc, etc to those assholes. And one more is that if you "hack" the database of people who payed in btc, all you'll see is a bunch of addresses. As opposed to the cc system, they can take a shit tonne of money from you &amp; steal your identity! 
The benefits of btc for us in the 1st world aren't abundant at the moment, you're correct there, give it time however &amp; I'm sure more uses will be thought of in the future, much like the Internet.

Hi :) 
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:37:51
People spend less money on alcohol because they have a wider variety of substances to choose from. Pharma companies much the same, weed can compete with painkillers and epilepsy in certain cases. Mdma can be used for ptsd, ketamine for depression &amp; psychedelics for people's general well being leading to a decline in the sale of meds like xanex and antidepressants. I personally don't think that big Pharma is too concerned with all drugs being legal because it's not something that's going to happen soon. I'd imagine it's a thought in the back of their mind. Because if someone can do shrooms a few times a year (in a therapeutic setting) instead of taking a pill everyday, it'll lead to a big loss in revenue for them. 
All the stuff I've said about the substances above can be found with a quick Google search, I haven't included links because this post is already too long!

Sorry, maybe I should've stated it above. But they'd for sure manufacture the new products too as you say, however they'd be making less money from these new products because of the frequency at which the patient has to take them (ie a lot less than their current products) With mdma therapy people suffering with severe ptsd only took 3-4 sessions to rid them of their ptsd. 
  
Lsd assisted therapy was found to be about the same, link: 
There's a lot more literature on these subjects readily available  floating about the internets if you wanna research more but the trend seems to suggest that they'd be taking these drugs far less frequently than once a day.
Btw, I'm not a "Big pharma is bad, shrooms are good" type of person. I try to be pretty rational when it comes to these matters because I'm massively against the drug war as are many others, so it's important we conduct ourselves civilly &amp; rationally.

Is there an easier way to explain bitcoins to my parents? I showed my dad the "What is a bitcoin" video but he was just as lost as he was before it. I want to spread it as virally as possible! 
I think the media plays a part in this because the coverage it received over here (Ireland) is a bunch of people who have no idea what they're talking about &amp; they keep comparing it to fads &amp; bubbles without actually going into what it is/does. Clueless retards.

The price swung ~$20 before the Jeff Berwick news came out, it went sub $120. However I do think that this is another small factor as to why we're having such large price swings in the last few hours, it just doesn't seem like a very significant factor to me. 
I understand it implies that it's gonna be long time before we see bitcoin atms but would that really shake bit coin holders confidence this much? I know that that would be a significant barrier to entry to mainstream acceptance &amp; we may never see bitcoin atms because of this but we still have the prospects of paypal/wu adoption, bitcoin debit card, more merchants accepting it every day. 
Bitcoin still has all its advantages &amp; potential to grow with or without an atm, so for people who have some bitcoin knowledge (which seems like a decent amount of people based on the lack of response to ddos' in the recent past) this shouldn't scare them so much.
I posted a response above as to why I think SR being down isn't a huge factor, I'll repost it here: 
"It's true that a lot of coins pass through silkroad everyday but silkroad was down for maintenance on the 16th of this month &amp; bitcoin didn't have a large silkroad related swing.
Also if the bitcoin price was that heavily correlated with the volume of coins going in/out of sr we'd be able to look back at the charts &amp; directly see the correlation, it's just not there.
I'm not saying sr being down has nothing to do with the price swings going on now, it's definitely a contributory factor along with a few big sales &amp; whatever the hell else is going on!"
Illegal content in the blockchain is something that has the potential to drive the price down if the media picked up on it &amp; started reporting it in their oh so favorite scaremongering style. Having said that though I just did some googling &amp; it wasn't reported on by a single news outlet on the web, I'm mainly getting /bitcoin threads. I Googled "illegal message inserted into the blockchain" 
That's waaaaay tl;dr, apologies I had to get all my thoughts out there :P

You fundamentally disagree based on nothing more than: "If he can take money he will" 
This definitely does apply to *most* people, but not Max Keiser, he's a different breed.
This point of view seems to imply that the two can't be mutually exclusive, he can help the bitcoin economy while making money. Money wouldn't even be a motivating factor for him btw.
Seriously though if you watched the Keiser Report you wouldn't be doubting him.

Seriously? 
It's not hard to understand the context behind "Bitcoin millionaire" What's bitcoin most commonly measured in? Euros or dollars.
What is it more likely to mean: Someone who has 1 million btc (That'd be 150 million dollars) or someone who has 1 million dollars. 
If it was 150 million dollars they wouldn't neglect to mention that fact, not only cause it's a sick number but mainly to give it some real world tangibility. 
I can't even believe I even have to explain this.

@_date: 2013-05-02 15:08:13
I knew the attack was effective &amp; that it's been 2(3?) days. I was not aware that dpr was considering going semi-private.
So, just trying to think about this a little further &amp; clarify what's going on. People are cashing out because they think there'll be a lot less bitcoins going around the bitcoin economy thus driving the price down, so they are/were trying to get out before other people realize that? 
What are your thoughts? 
Edit: I get up for 2 mins &amp; it's smashed to $95, I'm not worried about it, just really curious as to what things are causing it.

It would be a temporary (albeit big) roadblock. What would happen is we'd need to see highly professional exchanges arise &amp; they would. Because the vc's &amp; people with big $$$ know that the value in bitcoin is still there, they'd need go with only trusted banks too so that they can guarantee this never happens again.

@_date: 2013-04-09 00:36:33
Wowowow, WHAT an angle spinner. 


He's already beginning to sound like he thinks that we think bitcoin can just jump soon &amp; fix the currency markets.


His whole argument is based on what if bitcoin was implemented the way it's behaving right now. That's just insanely stupid! 


Really, you really think this? 


Yes, that's HIGHLY likely. (Or at least you make it out to be)


Can you say mother fucking angle spinner?! What a COMPLETELY baseless argument. It's such heavily correlation, what a huge minus point from bitcoin, wtf are we doing guys?!
Edit: I have to edit it, re reading this. What a pompous prick. 


Please stfu, the ignorance is too strong. 


Again, his complete argument is based on if bitcoin were to be implemented now or in the anywhere in the short term. Things are only going to happen for a world currency (which is a lofty enough goal in itself) if bitcoin stabilizes &amp; stops swinging like crazy &amp; that's a huge if.
He sounds super negative about bitcoin &amp; has extrapolated that to the maximum point.  
Edit: Please, don't just downvote, at least try to back up your opinion(s)
Edit 2: Also what's with the BITCOIN
 
Edit 3: So no one can defend the author's points of view? Awh that's too bad. 
Edit 4: I think part of the reason I'm getting downvoted is the fact that I didn't elaborate on my arguments very much, thereby making my points seem devoid of content to those that side with the author (Because they're gonna have a lil case of cognitive dissonance in that they'll be able to re enforce their bias in the face of what they see as someone (me) complaining about someone being negative about bitcoin)    
I did so because it's not necessary, the stupidity of the authors arguments speak for themselves. If anyone would like to open a dialogue please do so.
