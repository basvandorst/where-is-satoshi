Lotta people don't know that the price level is dictated by the government.
Because they have monopoly over the dollar printing press, so they set the price of the dollar.

No because let's say the government declares a $20 trillion tax, and decides to print $0.
Now everyone has to give up their dollars. Next, the government continues with more tax, but no one has dollars left.
So they come to the government: "Okay, so tell us how to get these dollars??"
Then the government can decide the price.

Zero dollars is possible, zero cents also, and even absolute zero in terms of 10th decimal place.

Don't make a fool of yourself by buying at $400
Wait for $200 and then also don't buy.

A good plan for Deflation, is to make it impossible for people to own much dollar.
So a good way to destroy dollar deposits is to crash bitcoin.
Tldr Bitcoin's timely death will be good to combat inflation.

The idea is "hey, this is going up hopefully!"
So no one wants to spend it, like that Fool whomst bought a pizza for a hundred million dollars.
But also if bitcoin is collapsing, no one wants to accept it as pay either.

What is actually a bitcoin?
Suppose I own a torrent file recorded on my hard disk. I can open it.
Let's say the folder reads:
1. Screenshots.jpg
2. Missionimpossible.mpg
3. PiratRipperz.html
Now what about BTC, what do people mean when they say they own 1 BTC on a "cold storage" USB or something.
Can you open it, and what do you see on it.
