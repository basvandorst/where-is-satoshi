What's the reason for the dip?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:09:55
Are you one of those Bitcoin Cash guys always trash talking Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:57:04
Probably because of its scarcity. That there's a limited amount.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:35:58
What's your prediction of when bitcoin will reach that price again?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:07:33
I wanna own a whole bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:29:35
What's the reason for the panic?
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:32:58
Sounds like Al Gore
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:16:06
I buy/hodl because of the rise in value, and that's what most people are doing. I think that this growth stage of Bitcoin is what is leading to mass adoption and this and other cryptos will be the new way of exchanging money as more people catch on, first getting in because of the rise in value and staying because of its mainstream acceptance.

The price is low now and Robinhood is about to allow trading for over a million users. IMO its a great time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:21
Bitcoin is a tangible, fixed, limited asset that will inevitably increase in demand. Do not trade with emotions. Buy when others are selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:55:27
It's wrong of you to direct people to a site that charges high fees and less control over their bitcoin when there are superior options like Gemini. We need to promote the best of bitcoin and give it a good name. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:24
Thank you for your service. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:36:19
Not condoning not doing your taxes, just to put that out there, but they also pay for wars that you don't consent to. The more you know.

I think whatever is left at the end of the year. Like an annual thing. Not sure though.

A few large dips ago, before confidence in bitcoin was high, and people didn't know what to expect, you should have seen this sub. Right when it fell a couple hundred points everyone immediately started trash talking bitcoin saying things like "I should have bought Bitcoin Cash or ethereum", just knocking bitcoin at the first sight of a dip. Then the veterans would post memes of roller coasters with things like "just another day in bitcoin *yawn*". Then as soon as it recovers the whole attitude of the sub changes and they act like they never trash talked it. Its hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:47
Don't just hodl, byu 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:27:55
I predict a further short term dip until the futures hype blows over, then will continue its current growth pace after a few days. It seems these scares come up right when bitcoin is strong in momentum.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:45
I would love a place like that. Where can I find this mythical "wilderness"?

Shit. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:39
They might know
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:40:35
Indubitably. Just watch the news. Every time you see a pro-Bitcoin article, buy more. That is one way of feeling less cautious about buying. Because if mainstream is adopting, you know it's gonna be YUGE

Isn't that corrupt as hell? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:35:00
Lol. I'm a dumbass. My rationale for blurting out Morocco was because they were the first to recognize the United States as a country so I used the same logic.

Dollar (bitcoin) cost averaging
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:37:50
$900 for me. It was a calculated risk I am glad I made. Been buying more and hodling since
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:28:07
I never had problems with Gemini. Why you fucking around with Coinbase? I left once they almost lost my money. Didn't want to risk it again. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:10
Here's your chance.

Make sure you know your personal info including social security number will be given to the IRS when using Coinbase. So do your taxes, kids! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:32:04
Better yet, bitcoin cost averaging. Or commonly known as dollar-cost averaging. Show me a more reliable method than bitcoin cost averaging.

Smh you guys just *now* realize Coinbase is bad? Just because it's simpler doesn't mean it's better. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:10
Gemini is what I use
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:04:40
I just don't like coin base due to their principals kind of in opposition to the spirit of bitcoin. they seem to be a company that is like the old way when bitcoin should represent a new, better way. I guess we can agree to disagree. Haven't heard of Gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:07:05
Why people still use Coinbase is beyond me. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:33
Don't use Coinbase unless you want your coin in purgatory. I use Gemini and haven't had any problems. They even respected Bitcoin Cash withdrawel. Not sure if Coinbase did that.

I accidentally panic sold a small amount. Should I just wait for the dip to put it back in or should I just do it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:40:43
I dont hear about this shit happening in other exchanges. Now you have to wait several days for them to respond to your service ticket. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:38
They have been reporting a lot of one-sided articles lately, in my view 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:18:50
Just buy. It's definitely going up, IMO
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:43:17
Sold a portion. Will buy back when trend swings back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:41:55
Have you been goooood right before Christmas? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:20:31
Gemini for auction style trading and great for maximizing gains. Low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:43:01
What would cause it to crash? Just because people are betting against it? I guess we'll see who's loyal. But then again, as popular as bitcoin is, our loyalty isn't as important. I have no idea what to expect, to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:51:28
Do we, as early adopters have the fortunate foresight to profit off of this inflationary period? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:35:21
You can always diversify. Put some in bitcoin, put some in stocks, maybe other cryptos.
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:59:11
That guy's not on weed. It doesn't make you *that* stupid
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:58:17
Good idea putting money in Bitcoin. But also wise to diversify your portfolio in other investments to hedge your risk. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:08:32
I like ETH. It has a bright future ahead of it. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:24:48
But you have to pay brokers commissions but the initial appeal of banks was they paid you interest for holding your money.
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:45:40
Gemini is my favorite. Also RobinHood and Circle. But you can't withdraw from the exchange so it's just good for investing.
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:56:05
Are you sure that altcoins would be more reliable than Bitcoin? Bitcoin has significant backing. But diversifying with altcoins is a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:06:03
If it does start crashing, do you have a threshold to where you would cash out? I was just wondering. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:12:13
I never thought of that. I'll have to try it sometime.
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:33:46
True. It will definitely double in the soonest time possible, because the upward trend is staggering. A brand new medium to gather around. This is a new thing. And I think its going to change the world someday. The world's not ready quite now, but it will be soon. And bitcoin is going to be a high price. I would start worrying about the end of this golden age of bitcoin when governments start getting involved. Then its going to be the end of the appeal of bitcoin. That's just how I view it, personally. I don't know about you.
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:15:55
Purchased at 1180, now watching it fall to 1160, trending down. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:15:10
Now is the time I was talking about. 1160. That's what I call buying on sale. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:13:54
I put in $100 at 860, and $100 at 940. When it got to 1130 I put in $150. It grew a good amount so I had somewhere between $370 and $400 net worth. Used it to buy $200 worth of products online when it dropped to like 1040. So my initial investment of $200 is the only thing that grew, which now grew to $250, which I think is really freaking cool because that is an ROI above the 8% yield traditional investors settle for. and it serves as a great medium to receive ROI, because its growing fast. But back then, I had money to spend.That spending money has transferred to bill money, so I can't afford to invest much right now, although I'd like to, which is why I'm waiting for a dip in the market so I can buy some low-priced Bitcoin. I'm afraid I missed the train this cycle. There is always a dip / crash after giant peaks. So in the meantime I'm going to invest pocket change while I wait for the next go-around.
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:06:29
I'm not driven by fear. I'm driven by numbers. That equates to intelligent investing. Optimism is how I view investments. Because even in a bear market, sound logic yields profits, with risk and learning from mistakes along the way. Basically what I'm saying is, based on past behavior and coincidence, I am expecting the same luck to happen when I invest next. I'm going to be the reason the market crashes next time I buy bitcoin. That's how unlucky I am. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:16:49
Now is the time to buy, mate, just wait for it to bottom out first. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:14:36
I feel this is the best choice. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:16:25
I am just quoting other people. I don't really know how a lot of this works. I am clueless when I hear forking. I am jealous of miners who must have some serious hardware to play with. I don't know what 1MB means regarding bitcoin. I don't get how the rules work. I don't get how it can be set in motion by Satoshi, but questionable about intentions and changing needs in the future. Is there a void of certainty similar to the United States Constitution that was written for yesterday's needs, but needs to be amended for today's needs. My personal opinion, is I believe in staying firm with how things are set, stability, and am somewhat afraid of major change and risking the uphill climb I have been experiencing before major changes were proposed. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:44:46
I just don't want to buy high. I really want to buy. But I am not sure now is the right time. I know in the long-term its going up, but I'd rather buy when there's a crash. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:51:13
I agree. Which is why I'm going to throw in a little extra money. Nothing too fancy. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:18:16
If you look at past figures, you'll notice a pattern. At least I did. After studying the chart and looking for patterns, I realized that Bitcoin raises in price closer to Friday, crashes on Saturday, bottoms out on Sunday evening. Then spikes on Monday. Peaks on Tuesday. Then crashes on Wednesday. Recovers on Thursday. And the process begins all over again. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:44:04
If you think in the long run that the price will be up.
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:20:50
Who owns them then? Or are they lost forever?
