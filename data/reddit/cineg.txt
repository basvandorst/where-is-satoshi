because it is not shitty?
all of these people who have been bashing coinbase since they added bch are a bunch of hypocrites.
prior to that action, you barely heard a peep aboot coinbase.

instead of telling people to go somewhere..why do you not even try to have a discussion on the topic that takes a few brain cells to interact?
both subs are your generic sophomoric shit show lately..perhaps going back to lurking is a good idea.
you are not going to find any civil discourse in either sub. that is for damn sure!

kraken has segwit, and it is not any better. *shrug*
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:36:27
of course you have to start somewhere...that is my point 
answer me this...what IF (just humor me here and try to think aboot it in this way) the world speed limit for EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION was 30kph(30mph), and the worlds trade was now severely hamstrung by the archaic limit that just so happened to be put in place when transportation was just beginning.
what would you think would be the best, first, most logical (not long-term mind you) way to find a fix for the 'problems' that plague the worlds transportation systems that i spoke of in my scenario? add more routes? divide the customer base in a more efficient manner? make airports talk to each other in a sensible way?
FYI, i am not what some people like to label others as 'big blockers' .. i like to think like any good logical engineer would. so i would appreciate it if people could have some decent conversation regarding the issues at hand...instead of needless name calling, telling one to go elsewhere because they are not wanted, or just simply down voting. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:12:00
not sure..but nothing that you have mentioned, nor any other improvements that may or may not happen.
i honestly do not know. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:08:01
you are not wrong.
even if there is 100% adoption..it would still not fix the problems.
if you think that lighting is going to help..you might as well just stay with the traditional banking systems.

i made a transaction of around 3k two days ago, with segwit. 
the fee was HIGHER than what it would have been if i had moved the same amount from one bank to another bank.
the confirmation time was well over four hours for just 6 confirmations.
i am sorry, but segwit is not going to fix the scalability problem. it might make a little bit of difference, but you are still trying to put out one of the biggest forest fires with coffee straws as your hoses to pump water onto the fire...(if this makes sense?).
i am not a 'big blocker' but it just does not make sense to keep something at such a low arbitrary size when you have the technology today that can/would handle a larger size.
the whole '20k$ full node' notion is horseshit. case in point. i built a san earlier this year that consists of the following: xeon x5690, 128gb, single raid card (forget the model off the top..perc h810 i think), samsung 960 pro 500gb nvme os drive, samsung 960 pro 256gb nvme swap drive, 4u 24 bay case with redundant 1000w power supplies. this was just a little bit over 1k$ .. and if you threw in the eight 8tb wd80efrx drives that are currently in the case..it is right around 2500$.
if you are not able to run a full node on this platform (which has 16 bays for future drive space expansion that can get you over 100+tb easy) then you are doing something wrong.
segwit is not a enough to fix everything. it is a VERY small band-aid at best. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:44:52
granted, this is 100% true...but i left that as a unsaid known in this case. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:58:27
you cant save your transaction history or information with blockfolio and go to device to device...
that is a problem imo
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:59:57
try moving to a new device..you have to put all your transactions back in. ��

just the truth, however 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:23:45
its not a payment method right now...that is for damn sure (disclosure, i have many coins that i have not sold...but i would love to a coin that is mass accepted AND capable of making easy transactions. btc is not that right now.. perhaps it will be again in the future) 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:54:15
it may not be btc that becomes the defacto replacement for day to day purposes
it may be a coin that is in development...who knows?
kind of like the option to use visa, mastercard, american express, or debit cards now. you could see three or more dominant coins that ppl use daily for personal use. this is the most likely case. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:46:23
man, it is the fighting between btc and bch that really hampers BOTH SIDES!
will someone grow the fuck up and realize this?
btc, you do your thing that you think is best for btc
bch, you do your thing that you think is best for bch
you are acting like an immature child with all of these little piss ant gripes aboot each other.
if it is off putting to a person like myself, then i am sure that it is extremely off putting with an investment firm or the likes.
if we all want the best for cryptocurrency as a whole..these 'wars' serve zero purpose and set back growth across the board. that is just asinine.
damn! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:06:25
you need more than 100 coins for the 1 million..

you can, BUT i would highly recommend that you move the majority of your stake off to a hardware wallet..like ledger (blue or other) and keep enough in the coinbase wallet to make purchases with.
there are plenty of people who have way more than you think in their coinbase wallets. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:09:55
ledger blue is a good one if you are willing to wait for it and spend a little bit of money for it.

just not a currency.
you can build many different things with it.
i am not a eth expert by any means, but i do know that it is not just merely meant to be a currency.
if you have to ask, research it

whales, yes perhaps...but there are some seahorses around. ��
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:28:40
the thing that is a bit off putting with phone / computer based wallets is that what do you do when they go tits up? hope you are backed up (most people are not)
this makes the hardware wallet much more easier to swallow and then you can also backup your hardware wallet with a paper wallet kept in a fire proof / water proof safe.
case in point, i know of three people who lost ALL of their belongings (some had a few thousand in crypto, and another had well over six figures) in hurricane irma and henry. one of the people who lives in the us virgin islands was just decimated in their concrete house. it looked like someone planted c4 on the outside walls. they only survived in the underground building that flooded. they had a phone wallet, but the phone is mia. everything is lost other than what they have left on kraken. the others down in houston did have a paper wallet backup of a trezor hardware wallet, but the flooding just came so fast and destroyed it all.
basically, CYA because you NEVER know what might happen

iceland is pretty interesting for a mining industry imo..they are virtually substantial in their own power iirc
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:06:23
what did you do? i am curious 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:53:00
true, but when people say that btc is worth whatever..that is in fiat and only if they sell it on an exchange.
so when people say that btc could be 100,000..etc..that is only if they convert it. otherwise it is just something that you have and can spend some day when it is accepted by more and more merchants.
so the intrinsic value is just whatever.
*shrug, i had a lucid dream aboot all of this last night, it was weird*
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:51:05
i have edumacated myself over the past few months due to the fact that i was not really going at it all THAT serious until i really appreciated what the crypto currency market was.
i just started to buy blindly when btc was in the 600-800s, and figured that if it was something that i had later on..nice, but then it started to rise a bit and i figured out really quickly that it was going to be something very exciting and valuable. i have been building up my portfolio across the board since.
even though the latest downturn, i am still very much in the healthy side of things portfolio wise. which was very nice not to have any panic thoughts in the back of my mind because i knew that my position was covered (unless everything completely jumped into unknowns)
but it is still a good time to start buying and building a crypto portfolio imho...
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:26:47
perhaps, but you can just shift it to something that does more than just currency. like eth. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:05:41

also, diversity is very important! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:30:51
as in at all or just percentage wise?
wise people once said...do not put all the same fruit in the same box..or some shit like that.
if you are really interested in making some money..it is all aboot diversification. no, i am not saying that you have to hodl 10 different coins, but three or maybe five is a good idea.
at least it has been a good portfolio for me..im just saying...
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:29:15
you fucking knew what btc and crypto currency was that early...i wish that i did.
i was too busy fucking up my life then.
IF...and that is a huge fucking IF... i knew what was going on...i would have jumped all over it. i am always in some alpha or beta testing programs. hardware or software. even if it does not pan out.
so did you sell some? i am going to venture a guess as to you have more than one btc...either way. good times and good luck with all of this crazy crypto world! 
i mean, shit, just aboot RIGHT AFTER btc peaked yesterday..ethereum FINALLY found some traction and moved up to the levels that it was and i think that it should be at...or higher! finally! yesterday and last night was very good.... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:46:21
you speak the truth.
i have sold a few times, but i reinvested as soon as the dip(s) bottomed out.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:18:53
everyone has their own opinions..but i have found that what i am in (4 coins..) is a pretty good and strong portfolio.
i just cant see myself putting all i have in crypto on btc. sorry, but this is just one persons opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:22:48
hope that things get better for you man!
if you knew of btc &amp; eth at those prices..why did you not buy any of them? just curious..if it is personal..that is cool.
i am sure that whatever happens after the fork things will work back up to this level..but a good amount of correction will happen.
perhaps that will be a better time for you to start with purchasing a investing (that is if you are wanting to use btc as an investment..instead of just purchasing some and then using it to buy something)
either way..cheers sir!

already back in that range. didnt quite get 6k.
now people are taking profits from the run. it could go back to 4600~ which would be ok. just as long as it does not go back to the 600~ .. that would hurt..a LOT

age is just a number my friend.
i know plenty of 15-16 year old kids who know a great deal, and i have been in the field for over 20 years.
it is all relative. one is meant to accomplish certain things, and the other is meant to accomplish other things..
it is apples to oranges

if you were going to say alex jones...i was going to climb through my phone screen and beat you with it! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:00:33
pretty much how i started..the same mind set, but i bought 10 in the 600 range, and got hooked. bought ever since. i sat on the sidelines since btc was in the 100's..but i just never justified it in my head. that was not smart. 
i am trying to make it work out for a retirement plan for me. that is why i harp diversification 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:43:37
if you did, reinvest it..or diversify
otherwise..hold off until it is around 10k or at least just after the fork. this way you can see how things are going to shake out..and it might be a better idea then.
also, it depends on how much you have. if you have a few coins..i would hodl. if you have a few hundred..sure..use it for what it was meant to be. currency. (just not fiat currency)
