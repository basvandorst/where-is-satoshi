It should be as easy as possible to run a node, not more difficult otherwise only some can verify.
They won't use it unless they feel it can survive and scale to their needs, obviously. If they're unsure they might not even come to development at all. Block size affects that calculus. 


As I've said, increased centralization is your assumption and many disagree. And you're wrong about unbounded blocks - many people advocate removing the cap entirely. It is not hard to argue that case.

Coins received pre-fork are valid on both forks so there is nothing to worry about. 
The only concern is receiving coins after a fork. Here's how that will work :
If all inputs in the transaction where you receive coins are from pre-fork blocks , then that transaction is valid on both chains and you have nothing to worry about. Recursively. 
The *only* case to worry about is receiving money post-fork where any input is from a post-fork coinbase, either directly or indirectly. That transaction is only valid on one fork and so will only appear confirmed on that one fork. 
Now Satoshi was a very smart dude and had foreseen this kind of split. So he made coinbases *unspendable* for 100 blocks. They can only be spent in a block 100 or more higher than the mining block. 
That means that anything you receive for the first 100 blocks after a fork is unambiguously valid on both chains and so you have nothing to worry about. 
And I suspect that both chains don't survive 100 blocks after a fork without one being an obvious winner and the other dying out.
In other words, don't worry be happy.  You just need to be careful when receiving coins post-fork and both forks survive 100 blocks, which IMO is exceedingly unlikely. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:48:30
If hashing power is split evenly it would be twice that time, right? So about 34 hours. And forks about block size are not going to be a surprise. 
Sending coins derived from a side fork's 100 deep coinbase would not be valid on the mainline fork. I don't understand your taint concern.

Fucking armchair central planners kidding themselves they can create a market in something. 
The fee market already exists, and has for years. Learn to live with it.
When space is insufficient and fees are 0.005 BTC for a simple transaction, what are you gonna say? "Yeah you see, we created this market! It exists! Supply and demand means price goes up!" Then what? You realise you discovered what the whole world already knew, the result is meaningless, and that you don't have an actual plan at all?

This is a commonly claimed as obvious. I believe it's far from obvious, and that the opposite is much more likely. If you can get many companies and wealthy individuals using bitcoin, you will have all the decentralisation you need, as they will have an obvious interest in running their own nodes, for a whole host of reasons. If you restrict what they can do with artificial centrally-planned limits they will probably never get involved in the first place.

You're committing the common fallacy of ignoring the unseen. 
You're not asking yourself - how many more nodes might we have with an economic system that isn't artificially constrained, and therefore admits more users and businesses to adopt it because it can accommodate their usage requirements? Standing still and doing nothing itself causes economic actors to evaluate your potential solution to their problems and dismiss it as "capacity constrained" or "unscalable", and therefore not even take part in the system in the first place. 
Give it a chance to scale and decentralise, and it just might.  Think of the negativity Satoshi faced when he proposed bitcoin. All naysayers. He ignored them and proved them wrong by doing it. And here we are today. 
Central planning doesn't work. Let the system breathe and find its own way.

The encrypted private key is not fully encrypted. Read the spec, it even mentions / warns of this explicitly. 
I consider it a flaw in this BIP.  Would be easy to set up a server on the net where you enter a BIP38 key and it shows you the likely address and balance (can never be certain but can be assuming the encrypted key is real with at least one txn).

That way,  no,  perhaps less than 1 BTC. 
However over 100 BTC was destroyed in two pairs of duplicate version 1 coinbases. 
Gox destroyed thousands of coins in a famous case of a bug rendering the coins forever unspeakable with irredeemable scripts. 
So yes, thousands of coins are permanently destroyed, in addition to a much larger number whose privkeys are simply unknown.

@_date: 2015-01-22 03:43:57
You say a size limit is the naive response, I prefer knee-jerk. However, after consideration it is also the correct solution. 
We have been operating for years with a limit that, practically speaking, hasn't been a limit so far. Yet for over three years, most transactions have attracted fees and miners have not been filling blocks with spam. Indeed, the need to pay a fee is easily felt more if you want a quick settlement of a payment. 
There is therefore no reason to expect this to change were the limit 16MB, or if there were no limit at all. It is risky to a miner to increase the block size and risk being beaten to the propagation finish line, and back of the envelope calculations can put that risk for a small transaction at not much less that 0.0001 BTC currently. 
Block space is scarce, larger blocks carry increasingly larger risk of losing your block reward AND fees. That is enough, even as block rewards go to zero, free floating fees and miner determined block sizes will find an equilibrium that takes care of the rest.
No central planning please, no one has enough information to make the right decision.

Yes coinbases are mandatory. See iXcoin which is based on bitcoin's codebase, already has no block reward, most blocks just have a coinbase paying zero to an address. Bitcoin, being non fake, will have real transactions so I doubt that'll ever happen.

The quadratic claim is transparently false propaganda spread by attention seekers and concern trolls like Peter Todd and intended to mislead. A full node simply needs to download and verify all transactions, which is linear in the tx count and therefore in the number of users, assuming a fixed tx count per user. As bitcoin becomes more useful and popular that count per user may well increase, which is simply a reflection of its increasing success. 
If the bitcoin network expands ten times, so there are ten times as many nodes, my full node doesn't need to connect to ten times more nodes to do the verification and be part of the network. It simply has ten times more transactions to verify, not 100.

They do dodgy sit when they know they've got a politician in their pocket. Government sponsored immunity. Awesome right?

If true, good luck to them,  they will lose. But you presented only hearsay.

Why do you come to that conclusion? Bitcoin's evolution is no secret. But 99% of the sheeple haven't even thought about what's happening yet

dude get out the bubble of stupid analogues. The Mississippi exists physically in the real world. It's not there to pollute virtually.

You have to understand that bitbet is run by a psychopath, MP. 
He loves attention. He loves drama even more. He will twist any literal reading his way. As long as you understand that, he will play fair with the remaining rules. But that is not the normal person's understanding of reasonable behaviour. Play at your own risk.

Someone needs to challenge these assholes to the confidence of their conclusions. Their conclusions contain so many (already documented) weak assumptions that will only degrade with time. 
I'm sure they're aware. Let them escrow 25 BTC for evidence that anything in their tracing of transactions is flawed. I guarantee you they wouldn't put up the money. Otherwise ignore them.
