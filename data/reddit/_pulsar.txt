So then no further discussion on the topic because it's been happening for a long time? That's dumb. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:30:43
No, because it wasn't the topic at hand.

Not only are women not discriminated against, they enjoy a 2:1 hiring preference over equally qualified men.

You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. He's the definition of a fish. Any high stakes pro in the world would pay good money to sit with Dan.

You're right that Dan is a losing poker player but you're very wrong about this particular point. Even the best players in the world will not cash in most tournaments they play and they could (and do) easily bust out in the first levels of a tournament. 
Tournament poker is definitely a skill game but there is tremendous variance involved.

I moved money from Blockchain to Coinbase on Thursday morning. It's been pending since then, until about 2 hours ago when the transaction disappeared from Coinbase entirely. 
I still see the Sent details in my Blockchain account and it says the transaction is pending and will be returned if it isn't accepted or whatever. 
Anyone have this happen to them in the past? 
I assume it will either get returned to Blockchain or reappear in Coinbase?

I've been able to log in all day but a transaction from Blockchain has been pending for 8 hours when it would normally go through within 15 minutes.

I was just about to make a new post. Yes, I'm also experiencing this same problem. Glad I'm not alone but they need to fix this ASAP!
