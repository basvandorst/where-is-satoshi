Currently I am paying $.50 per internet because of a P2P Fifa sharing incident.

Putting it all in right away like that, with no notice... 
I mean I would have preferred it maybe just some of the blockchain was downloaded into my hard drive, just the tip maybe, and then it could have asked me if my hard drive could take more
but it just.. it just put it all in there without even asking...

Why exactly is bitcoin cryptocurrency? It is less anonymous that fiat currency.

source? No offense but citibank &gt; reddit comment

It touched me [here]( 
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:37:36
Ah its alright my mistake. I've done a lot of file sharing so I guess I've paid my part into the system now!. 
At least i'm on a third party ISP (Electronic Box), if I had one of the big 3 companies I'm probably owe them an organ or something. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:15:16
Yeah... so next time you're going to early adopt on a financial investment feel free to let me know!

Well I'll be damned, apparently this would actually work for the period of 1966-
For shits and giggles I calculated inflation for the highest period available, 1966-1986. 
$100,000 in 1996 dollars would after inflation be the equivalent of $338682.53 1986 dollars. Interest on a 20 year fixed at the 1966 interest rate would be 298,485.52. Over the 20 or 25 year period, but not the 30 this would result in inflation exceeding the interest rate. This would only be true if you locked in during the first part of the year though, by the end of the year and anytime after interest would dwarf inflation. By 68 with the 7.52% fixed rate in 20 years inflation would turn $100,000 into $340,659.25 but interest would $426,368.50.

1. You completely missed the point, buffet invests in companies because of their intrinsic value 
2. I've made $5,000+ over the last 5 years off of investments, its not a lot but I certainly didn't loose anything. But bye all means keep pretending like you're some kind of savant while berating others.

Awesome I appear to have successfully bumped my 42 cents of magic internet dubloons into a lite account. 
Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:42:08
Cool thanks man!.

If it crashes again I might pick some up but only a small amount and I'd be treating it as a poker bet w/ a greater fool argument. I mean there is something to be said for putting money into something volatile when you recognize the volatility. 
The whole bitcoin thing has actually got me thinking more about actually putting some money into stock. I definitely think the conversation it has raised, the technology, and the utility it has generated represent big positives. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:38:34
I'll pay $2 per BTC... final offer
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:52:19
I've gotta say the one nice thing about the bitcoin people is that no one can accuse them of being selfish... i've gotta wonder how bitcoin millionaires would end up spending their cash as that population likely has some quirky things in common 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:26:27
I put inheritance in mutual funds in 2007, because you know mutual funds are safe... fucking financial crisis 
Have you pulled out your coins at any point because of speculation on the crashes or have you just pulled them out to spend and kept the rest in?
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:55:11
you sound like you're selling berry juice... seriously replace the word bitcoin in your post with acai berry and it sounds exactly the same
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:34:33
You rich bastard. I made the mistake of transferring my 0.00184840 BTC so mtgox... and the transaction minimum is 0.01.... arg

I'm at $0.50 a gb if I go over (fucking canada) on my $40 a month plan. I accidentally left utorrent open and ended up sharing a fuckload of stuff over too weekends. My october internet bill is $200.00.... student life FTW. I hope everyone enjoyes there copies of FIFA 2014....
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:31:38
I think I gave the transaction thing the address of the bitcoin-qt wallet though so i'm screwed right?
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:58:16
Meh, small bumps. Even with 20/20 hindsight you're doing excellent. I keep looking at what could have been done with the cash I had in 2007. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:14:18
That is $1244 per ounce which given the current geopolitical climate, which would indicate the price of gold should fall significantly over the next few years.. is too much. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:58:43


That is ridiculous. As an investment bitcoin is stupid. As a transactional currency bit coin could be amazing. $1,000,000 BTC relies on the people who got in early convincing other people to arbitrary pay that much. 
Optimal value for 1 BTC == 1$. All of a sudden you could store you money outside of the traditional financial system, transfer cash easy, and send cash anonymously if you chose. 
$1,000,000, is BTC a 2 Trillion dollar idea? no, no it is not. A $1,000,000 BTC relies on convincing people that it is in fact worth 2 trillion dollars total. 
Meanwhile anyone slightly more reliable, or the banks just needs to come along and drastically cut fees on online transactions and bitcoin would be *completely and utterly dead*.

... why are people speculating about private loans with interest rates below inflation... this is not something that exists

I have been considering buying some bitcoins if the price comes down but after listening to a couple of podcasts on economics I have some grave concerns about bitcoins as an "investment". 
People compare bitcoins to gold, but the reality of the situation is that gold is a shitty investment. 
The podcasts I was listen to were discussing the underpinnings of the financial crisis and the generation of wealth through the use of accounting tools without actually creating any wealth. When gold or bitcoins increase in value it is because of *pure* speculation, not because any actual wealth has been generated. With other investments, say stock, an increase in value is because actual tangible value has been generated (i realize stock price can be highly speculative). 
TL;DR - Bitcoins and gold increase in value without generating real work value, Warren Buffet is loaded by investing in companies and increasing their tangible value. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:08:33
Jebus Christ. How early did you adopt bitcoins or do you just roam the internets making it rain?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:19:04
Go read up on [Economic Bubble]( on wikipedia. Literally every single psychological factor applies directly to Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:10:20
Good god. That isn't a bubble. Technology has meant that the carry capacity, of the earth has increased. The world population effectively can't increase beyond the caloric demands on the planet. 
Relax. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:20:23


Dude come on, that is just epic levels of bullshit. A mutual fund is diversified and has way less risk. My mutual funds for example went down by 19% in a single year due to the financial crisis (significant net gains following). Bitcoin has experience that loss twice *this week*. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:34:24
Come on man, gold is an obvious bubble 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:03:32
I am very tired.....
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:12:06
Yes the number of BTC would need to be changed. Lets face reality, no one really wants BTC to be a mainstream transactional currency, they want BTC to be worth as much as possible so they can get a lot out of a very minor investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:59:54
@ 1000 USD per BTC with a minimum volume of 0.01 BTC the minimum trade would be $11 no?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:39:17
You just said wrong and then didn't contradict anything that I said. 


The bitcoin market cap represents more than 40% of the circulating currency of Australia for example... Australia's currency is quite stable.
You're just making ridiculous absolute statements. 
Honestly look up what a bubble is. Bitcoin is a bubble.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:16:01
Well hypothetically couldn`t a few people with a large number of coins pass those coins back and forth ad infinitum in order to inflate the price?
