What is the minimum amount in BTC can I buy SCJX in this crowdsale? I want to participate with my 10mBTC.
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:25:14
This is good for bitcoin. The population in the Philippines is about 96 million. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 16:35:24
thanks... nice game.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:45:16
At this amount, i think i will lose the potential 10% gain to transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:26:14
Wow, got 0.0079 btc. Thanks Celery and to you

I frequently visit investing.com to check on forex and commodity prices. And, I noticed bitcoin was added under Forex section (the only non-major).

Nice idea but I think I'll be on the receiving end :). Not enough bitcoins yet to help fund the project (but maybe next Christmas). Hope there will be no limit on the karma points to qualify.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:24:58
Nice list. how about 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:02:38
using blockchain.info wallet... coz it did not reach the destination address.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:21:44
yes, it asked me a fee on each intput. I think I customized the transaction at blockchain.info, and able to consolidated about 0.01 BTC. Though only a small amount, it helped me in exploring bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:17:17
nice wallet... :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:45:32
i found it after noticing biticker saying btc = $129 on chrome
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:30:53
its new. maybe more ads to come.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:12:33
if the price goes down, its an opportunity to buy.
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:48:47
 is up now.
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:00:27
i visited again just to see the garlic. hahaha
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:48:28
thanks a lot.
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:57:25
hey buddy, are you the one who posted the garlic ad? :)
@_date: 2013-05-27 11:38:24
i'll be watching this... i highly respect michio kaku.
edit: bitcoin might lead us to transition from type 0 -&gt; type 1... yehey.
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:09:20
nice idea on helping the turks sir... maybe we should spread the word about bitcoin on social media with turkish friends.
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:41:53
also 
oh no my tiny btc... :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:39:29
i'll take note of this. thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:25:25
how to collect bitcoins :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:44:18
using the bitcoin client? I tried a very little fee using blockchain.info before but it never got confirmed. I canceled it after 4 days. BTW, my bitcoins are very small... all from faucets. :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:53:11
hahaha... can't stop laughing. I want to tip you but I don't have enough btc yet. want some garlic? lol
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:39:19
its a sign that paypal is afraid of bitcoin... which means bitcoin has lots of potential. :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:23:21
yes... im very happy. some sites are now giving only 10 satoshis. But who knows if in the future 1 sotoshis = $1
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:55:28
It was down a few hours ago. Then I noticed that the site was updated to a ptc-like website but paying 20uBTC per site.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:15:24
then they will loose customers from the bitcoin community.
