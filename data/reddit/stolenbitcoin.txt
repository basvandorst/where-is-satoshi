Josh, please don't listen to these types of loud complaints. Your real customers understand good security takes time. Taking time would have saved Bitfinex. As a loyal customer I appreciate the extra measures you guys take. I think unfortunately you guys are dealing with a lot of VERY emotional people when money is involved. I assume banks have psychology departments just to figure out how to deal with the likes of people like u/fumanumanuma who feel that they have money *on the line*. Thanks and good luck with your new dealing with the crazy public life.

Yep, exactly the same set up (almost). I had a 13 character (non-random) password protected WinRar file. Got a malware from downloading off off torrents, they uploaded my files (guessing) and withing 48 hours the wallets were empty. 
(1) I did not think people were getting remote access to computers like this.
(2) I thought a winrar password was something (it is not)
(3) I didn't think a PDF would be readable to a computer scanning files, and also that people could possible go through all my 1000s of files.

Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Your ideas really do seem strange, I wish you could somehow hear them from my perspective. Just imagine if you were being told of a new religion we'd never heard of, how messed up all the stories and made up people would sound. You are just talking about made-up-people that you believe in and made-up-extra-dimensions to the human condition, like a soul, or some "connecting force". Faith is called believing in made up shit.

I like that you said "install" that is what is seems like, you "install" a religion in a child. Also, it is pretty easy to prove that the God(s) most people believe in does not exist.

Thank you so much for the great communication! At this point I feel my main goal for bitcoin is to be able to continue to recommend Coinbase to people as a place to buy and store btc safely. Coinbase has been one of the few stable resources for bitcoin these past few years. You guys are doing great! Thank you Coinbase!

"Bad" data! Posh! We transform data like this all the time, removing outliers of 10% or greater. Also, coins before whatever-date are unlikely to be on exchanges and so have less influence on the price. Like it may be good to know if market cap in liquid btc is significantly lower that with all funds, like what if real MC is only 1/2 or 1/10 the size reported?

I had a similar issue. It seemed that once my account was locked they stopped responding, as if by locking my account the "problem" was fixed. I was in limbo for several days and it was agonizing. My guess this is not AT ALL a "screw or customers" issue, but that fact that they have a huge number of issues and the easiest way to deal with these are to just lock the account then deal with it later. So I am sure they have a list of support tickets with unknown (unset) priority, High Priority tickets then tickets that are high prioirty but have had the account locked so are not in a big rush to get to. Again, this is not, F--- Coinbase (CB), they just happen to be the only ones doing security right, and the truth is, if you are having a problem with your account, the best/safest way to take care of it is to lock the account ASAP then get an engineer to look into it when they can get to it. Now, how much does it cost to get a CB engineer to look into your support ticket for 0.1 btc? Well, lets say they cost CB atleast $100,000 a year to employee, so abut $50 an hour, not including facility costs, and lets say it takes at-least 30-60 min to resolve a ticket, so about $25-50 minimum I would think to find your 0.1 btc that you paid (0.1 * 0.0149*600) = $0.89 in fees for. So in essences, you give CB $1 and you want $50 of service, that is in essence the problem. Understand this and use CB for their security and professionalism, or buy your BTC in person or elsewhere at slightly lower prices and less transparency. 
TL;DR, No on can afford to sell you bitcoin at a reasonable price and have 24/7 engineering staff to answer your every issue.

Yes, thats what I am saying, that it is really easy to disprove the "theory" of an intelligent being creating the universe just like it is easy to prove that I did not create the State of California. It makes no sense to say that just because you can't disprove it that it is a (valid) theory or anything (it is not). Sorry, not trying to be hostile btw.

By not taking too many risks and by being lucky as fuck. About three months ago I moved 500 Ether from a cold wallet getting ready to sell online. I had gotten a malware from torrent downloading and it got my private key before I had a chance to sell. I did everything you are saying you did (except the illegeal software stuff) and still got fucked. Only way is to NEVER have them online, which (I think I am still the only one to notice this problem somehow) if your coins are never online then you can never sell/spend them.

Hey jerk, maybe this guy does know what he is talking about and is trying to ask something like: Assuming some cut-off-date for when coins were last moved (like 2012), what is that market cap?

We didn't need a whole new browser to send bitcoin "in browser". Why is this not just a Chrome extension?
@_date: 2016-10-17 18:01:58
Then Coinbase should put in giant, GIANT letters on their home page, "We may at anytime close your account and keep your money without telling you why, ever."
Until they do that (or something similar to mitigate the problem of (apparently) needing to steal money from customers "in order to follow the law" they are the ones at fault. Their business model == their fault when it fails. 
Source: I also got ETH "closed out" from me by Coinbase followed by the cold shoulder.

It's not that you did anything illegal, it is that you can not prove that you have not done anything illegal, e.g. sent coins you bought on CB off CB or to a known exchange. Did your coins get traded for an alt coin after leaving CB? Did you send any coins to CB that had come from a "known" dark-net address?

Can you be more specific? I would think you would want to err on the side of using a simpler fix when possible, i.e. increase the size of one parameter rather then invent a whole new data type for the system to segregate data into.
