Everyday I read about the USA I get the daily reminder that pure captilasim doesn't end too well either.

Welfare + capitalism.

The shitty universal Healthcare that is cheaper than Obama care? Also those shitty Nordic countries have a way better education system and cheap higher learning institutes.
And no I have actually not heard of your welfare system, I only hear about expensive Healthcare, education and your poor people which don't get paid enough.

I would still argue that there is a finite number of coins and bills even if that number changes. It is still a finite number.

The IRA were not terrorists. They were freedom fighters

Genuinely curious. What is the point of having a currency that you don't use and is unstable?

Idk man for people to push bitcoin there would have to be a benefit over normal cash and instant transfers.
The only thing I see is privacy but  that's about it. Everything else can be done faster with my phone?

This is just wishful thinking. There is no value unless it has a use. Gold is rare and has a use. Bitcoin is just rare and does not have a use.
So if no one is pushed to adopt it (because there is no use) no one will buy it.
Sure some people will see that it's steadily rising in price but people who can think rationally know that it's a high risk investment.

Ok that's a very good point. So it's basically useless for the average Joe?

Well yeah cause no accepts bitcoin where I am so no point in having money in a currency that I don't use.
If the only reason to buy bitcoin is to sell it later its not a very good investment. But funnily enough I have received bitcoin on reddit as a tip.

Sorry if this is a stupid question but you keep saying USD, will this work with other currencies as well?

Relevant to bitcoin?
