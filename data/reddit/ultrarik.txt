I have been following Roger for a while and never heard him say these things, I mean he does state that he was the first to invest in Bitcoin related start-ups and that he was doing internet based business before there was crypto, factually accurate.. but he doesn't put it in a "I AM BETTER AND A MILLIONAIRE YOU ARE NOTHING" kind of way. Where is this coming from?

You do NOT have to do anything for BTC to show up, it is instantly there when you open the app for the first time, right next to BCH.
Try it.
This is what it looks like

"If it were legit it would be named Bitcoin Cash wallet"
Both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core are in the wallet by default

By the way 'red herring' is not just a word people throw around to make themselves look smarter, because most people can tell when it makes no sense.
" A *red herring* is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important issue. "
My initial comment isn't a red herring because it addresses and refutes your claim: " If it were legit it would be named Bitcoin Cash wallet.", then I also provided evidence, moreover anyone can prove it by simply trying the app for themselves. 
  
Nice try shittalking apps you never even tried.

It is not wrong.
" Nice try though. "  
What was I trying? Using evidence to demonstrate you are wrong?  
BTC is literally right next to BCH the moment you first open the app.

Tried it yesterday on friends' phone.

Craig has virtually no power to perform such an attack, even when such news happens (as people recently started falsely claiming BCH was 51% attacked because of a 2 block reorg during the upgrade), the price doesn't care at all, in fact it kept going up from 380 to 420 and then some. With many cryptos this year we've seen negative news doesn't affect the price negatively, nor does positive news do the opposite.

I saw some people advocating for lowering the blocksize to 'encourage' LN adoption.. I don't think anyone here will listen to you lol
  
If bigger blocks is what you are inbterested in, you can use BCH without following any "crypto personality drama" perfectly fine :)
