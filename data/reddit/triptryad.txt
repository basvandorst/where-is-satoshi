**YES** This is so overdue. Prepare your wallets boys! This is going to be a dip you don't want to miss the chance to buy. 
Bitconnect death + bear market + Tether death will be the fucking biggest % dip of the last 2 years more than likely.
Buy this shit or be mad that you didnt when we hit the bull markets later this year.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:20:16


Thats what an exit scam is you moron. Its the same reason once Texas issued the C&amp;D to Bitconnect they ramped up illegal activity by proceeding to sell off the coins they had, build a big bag of money, then rob their users all blind RIGHT as they were put under the microscope by TX. Because the plan is to run with the cash to a place where the authorities cant touch you now that the jig is up.
So yes, exit scams involve ratcheting up the illegal activity right as the microscope starts hovering above. If you don't believe us you are welcome to go buy some BCC tokens, Im sure Bitconnect will return any day now.

Im going to go to bed tonight and fucking DREAM about how I could kill it in this market with 180k. I wouldnt even play games with shitty alts. Just BTC, ETH and perhaps ONE other coin. Then just let it rot for 5 years and come back and retire.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:10:24
BCash folks get bored with their subpar price movements and heavy bags every few weeks and try stunts like this to get people talking about their trash coin again. We should seriously find a more quiet way to address this stuff. Starve the morons of the attention they desire.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:56:15
Yes he has a valid point, we all know this. Its also the reason Bitcoin is hated so much within crypto. Theres no way you have such a flawless record versus attackers without making a LOT of fucking enemies along the way.
These days you have people with crypto portfolios wishing death upon Bitcoin just like the WallStreet assholes that have been calling crypto a bubble since $10.  Its a very interesting phenomenon in my opinion.
Every currency based shitcoin on the block has a community behind it that "hates bitcoin" and wants their coin to become the "new and better bitcoin". LOL. Live long enough to see yourself become the villain and all that, I suppose.
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:02:29
Literally everyone saying bitcoin is gonna fall says "Its different this time".
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:34:39


It was 10k on the first of December, its 13,500 now. Isn't that like a 35% movement? The impatience of the cryptomarkets is really insane. Traditional markets are lucky to get you 7% in a year. BTC gets you 5 times that in a month and its called dead by some, and said to be "not moving" by others.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:26:50
Yes. Are you new to crypto? Have a look at a chart if so.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:57:03
Bitcoin hittin 115k this year would mean epic runs for altcoins which would grow an order of magnitude more percentage wise (the good coins at least, not the shitcoins). That would be a crazy year. The correct moves would mean people who got in around late 2016 should be millionaires this year if they played their hands right.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:10:28
They do cover the fee if you send using GDAX UI. You can send any of the three currencies to any external wallet address or exchange for free using GDAX, but NOT on the coinbase ui. The Coinbase UI will charge you the transaction fee for sending crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:02:02
ALL? Of course not. The large earners? Yes. I think they absolutely would. I guess the difference is are you investing with the expectation of making long term LARGE gains over the years? Or are you just screwing around for a few thousand bucks. If you aren't going to make decent money, ignore it, you wont be a big enough fish for them to care.
But if you have plans and expectations for 6 figure plus earnings by the end, you might want to exercise a modicum of caution.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:34:32
Thats not true either IIRC. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:09:39


Yes, thats a no, or he would have answered you. The truth seems to be that it doesn't incentivize sloth; but it certainly seems to extract the sociopaths from the underside of the rock they inhabit. Once the very idea of there possibly being NO one ANYWHERE starving or living in famine or dying due to lack of resources, these guys emerge from the shadows to fight against that system and explain in doubletalk why helping the weak and disabled is a terrible terrible thing that will destroy us all.
In truth, I think its those folks that we should have our eye on. Something is truly fucked up in your head to grasp so tightly to the slow torture and death of people who cant provide for themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:43:46


Yep, I also noticed that buying BTC was slightly cheaper there 99% of the time than it was on GDAX. So thats a freebie too. With the CEO of coinbase being a scumbag I thoroughly enjoy having a quick and reliable alternative. Fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:42:02
They are verrrrry sensitive. Over the last 2 months every alt coin from Doge to Verge has grown exponentially, meanwhile BCash is sitting at the same high point of 2400 that it hit in October. Its no fun watching everyone else make bank while you sit around idle being the butt of the markets jokes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:58:56


By asking you to produce records. With audits its your responsibility to prove your innocence instead of their responsibility to prove wrongdoing. So you will have to produce records of every coin to coin and coin to usd trade made for that year, Plus the USD values of all the coins at the time of those trades to prove you didnt fudge the numbers. Failing to prove you didnt fudge the numbers makes you "guilty".
Currently they are figuring out who to audit by grabbing the peoples names from subpoenas to the fiat onramps like Coinbase, and soon from U.S. licensed exchanges like Bittrex. They can also just randomly audit you if you cash out lots of money at some point and cant account for where it came from.

@_date: 2017-12-18 08:15:21
Like a few days ago it briefly visited 15900 or so on GDAX. I didn't buy, I was waiting on 14, but it turned out 15,9 was the dip so I ended up accumulating more at 17,4. Pretty bad but better than not recognizing the rise and getting stuck buying at 18,8 or 19k lol.

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:23:49
Only coins on Gemini are ETH and BTC, and most of us don't trade them. We use Coinbase/Gemini solely as an onramp for fiat. So when I want to buy BTC Ill start using Gemini to buy my BTC instead. The .25% is less than the 1% thats baked into the higher price on GDAX anyway. Go check the btc prices on both right now and notice that gdax marks it up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:29:01
Let Ver be Ver. We should move on as a community and not look back. Bitcoin is up almost 8k since the 2x shit was relevant, lets just move on, count our money and let him and his followers wallow in misery hoping to one day again be as relevant as they were for that 2 day span where they pumped BCASH.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:42:07
Yes but it doesn't matter. GDAX and coinbase is merely an onramp to turn your Dollars into crypto. Once you have the crypto you can hold your eth or BTC or send it to another exchange free to buy alts then send them to your wallet.
People are suggesting you replace your fiat onramp. Stop using coinbase and use Gemini instead. Its overall much better for crypto to support a company that at least believes in Bitcoin and isn't buddy buddy with the people trying to destroy and replace it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:22:44
All of this is true. I dunno, I just have had a sinking feeling that many crypto investors aren't ready for this. But so many people seem to completely understand it and are ready to track their data. Maybe I'm overreacting and everyone will be fine.... Just don't want to see people blindsided and robbed 5 years from now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:23:36


Im seeing the opposite as usual.  It however probably does briefly flip on super volatile days like this, but 99% of the time its the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:24:43

I believe this too. If you aren't making much, they won't care. But... I suppose I believe crypto is going to start making a lot more people 6 figure returns starting in 2018 and onward. They will come after you when you hit that level. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:33:33
Nope no fee. This lack of fee for folks that figure it out is mainly the one thing keeping Coinbase at  in their space. No other exchange lets you take a few extra steps in order to pay 0 fees.

Its funny, but it has seriously surprised me how poorly the crypto community deals with bull runs. I would have thought people would be accustomed to it after the last 2 years. 
But I found as much anxiety, fud, and worrying the last week that I did during the actual bear market times when China and Jamie Dimon was suppressing the fuck out of the market.
Everyone scared to death of Futures trading, Tether exploding and on and on an on. Selling their bitcoin and shit.... Like wtf. How will you ever make money if you are as scared of doing **WELL** as you are of doing poorly. Its crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:37
Yes. And when you file you have to provide the IRS with the US dollar value for both coins in said conversion at the TIME of the exchange also. Which is going to be time consuming and annoying. The more trades the more taxing, and the more data you have to track.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:46:23


It was unclear before, and has been completely clarified and put into stone now. Theres nothing anyone can do about 2017, but everyone should be made aware of it for 2018 and forward to help them lower their tax burdens.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:44:49
Yep theres no perfect exchange yet. Doesn't exist, but this is closer to perfect than coinbase by a mile. That's our only claim here. No one is saying they are flawless.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:42:08
Previously if you traded crypto to crypto it wasn't taxed. No taxing happened until you cashed out to USD, At which point you just look at the profit and tax a percentage of it. Easy peasy.... Now every trade you do, crypto to crypto even is taxed, and you have to track the dollar values at the times of each trade to prove whether you profited on that tiny change and pay taxes on each individual one throughout the year. That could easily be thousands or more per year for active traders. And it'll all be short term tax rate (which is higher).
This makes buying and holding hilariously more profitable (albeit boring) because the fewer trades, the less your tax burden. The real kicker though is when audited, if you cant provide $ values at the time of each trade you ever made, then you can fail to prove your innocence or that you don't owe, which would cause you to "lose" your audit and be penalized further which is just bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:25:24
Someone needs to seriously get a discussion going to **warn all of the people in the U.S. trading crypto about the Tax changes. They are a big deal**, and day trading, scalping, swing traders and anyone others than pure holders will be taxed to fucking death. Its like the community as a whole has decided to not think/talk about this because of how bad it is. Ignoring this won't make it go away. People need to change their investment/trading plans for 2018 immediately.
Chasing those green candles and trading several times a day is going to lead to you being taxed out of your fucking gains 5 years from now. Remember, Audits don't work the way the court of law does. You are guilty until proven innocent in an audit, and not being able to provide the documentation proving your paid up properly results in you losing by default.
This is how they plan to steal the wealth from the millenials that will get wealthy from early adopting. **Please pay closer attention.**
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:30:38
Yeah thats going to be one hell of a market rally that day. You know its coming. I just hope its a surprise thing, and not a slow roll like "We are reconsidering bitcoin trading" followed by weeks of hype before the announcement. 
I like those huge fucking out of nowhere spikes due to news lol.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:32:44


Yes it will. The biggest con the BCash and Ver team ever pulled, was convincing thousands that Bitcoin Core would literally never scale. That it would merely stay as it is today **FOREVER** and NEVER ever ever EVER address scaling in any fashion.
Its a ridiculous claim, but I understand why they make it. Because to admit that BTC will one day address scaling is to admit BitcoinCash will one day have no niche to fill, and thus no reason to exist.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:00:59


Lets also then be just as honest. The CEO of coinbase has made NO secret about not liking the core dev team of Bitcoin, and has resisted Segwit out of full on spite. Hes a fucking cunt who is mad that he cant do anything to change the people behind the development of Bitcoin; so he wont implement Segwit as a jab back at those very same developers.

It requires empathy. And as unfortunate as it is; every person has varying amounts of it. Take notice of how people with such callous views often back or sustain them with extremely biased and selfish views. Stories about how "THEY" made it or how "THEY" fought through a struggle, so clearly every other persons struggle must be just as equally conquerable right? Because there are no variables.. every situation is exactly the same right? Only an extremely selfish and self centered person could have such a viewpoint.
Pat themselves on the back with an extreme desire to have someone to look down on. Is it really surprising people with such traits would violently oppose systems meant to literally raise the standards of living to a point where there was no "lower class"? For people who peg their self worth solely on the side by side comparison to others, the idea of being in any way closer to the 'bottom' is positively terrifying.
They will fight it. Even if it comes at the expense of suffering amongst others, they will fight it. Forever.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:29:43
There's no such thing as a 100% decentralized version of a fully centralized dollar. That's an oxymoron. You want transparent stablecoins, you cant have fully decentralized ones, that's not how it works. By virtue of it being pegged to the dollar you are asking for it to be controlled in some form. The benefit is in its utility to traders, so you need it to be transparent unlike tether, but they will all always have a form of centralization.

Its important to realize this report doesnt say Tether is backed by US dollars. It only says **there's no clear relationship between Tether printing and the BTC price/Crypto Marketcap.** Which anyone paying attention could have told you. They have  still been printing all year and its not moving the market at all. Yet last year people were saying mere 20m Tether prints were the cause of 30bn jumps in marketcap.. Well they printed 300 fucking MILLION in August, shouldn't we be soaring by now?
No.... Because that was all just confirmation bias. Tether is absolutely a scam and not backed by dollars, but its not RULING the market as claimed.

Thats because r/btc does nothing but cry about Bitcoin core and this sub all day. Their entire first 2 pages is nothing but talk about... THIS subreddit. That's not a healthy community by any measure. They should be talking about their own coin. But instead they just sit, jealous and mad that this subreddit is in constant celebrations of our gains.

Dude come on, you may be wealthy but thats a small percentage of people. Im hoping to chase down 1 BTC my self personally before it races out of reach. I have like... 8 months probably. And Ill have to get super lucky on my alts in that time to make it. If I don't it'll cross 13k and Ill never make it to the 1+ club because it will out sprint me forever.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:00:45
Thats the dangerous part of this attack. They could include replay protection, BCH did, but this attack is particularly low and scummy as it looks to catch people unsuspectingly and fuck them out of their real BTC as almost a "punishment" for not adopting 2x fork as the "real bitcoin". Like a child throwing a tantrum... If I cant make you like me, then maybe I can burn the place to the ground on my way out. Petty as fuck and no one should support that shit.
So many innocent people dont know about this and will lose godly amounts of btc potentially.

Your telling me. As someone who got into Crypto this August, BTC was like 3700 when I joined, we are WAY up, and this small dip is freaking people out.
But I was going crazy when we had that dip to 3k in Sept too so... I guess everyone has to learn.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:57:25


Im sure we want to. But Coinbase has Fiat to Crypto by the balls for Americans at least. Its by far the cheapest. It supports any bank and not just select ones for ACH.... I have been TRYING to find another gateway to turn 1k into 1k of BTC with no fees other than ACH deposit to Coinbase and Buying on GDAC with a maker order... But as far as I can tell its the only place I can make that 1:1 buy with zero fees.
I fucking hate them, but until Im done funneling fiat into crypto they are the worst neccessary evil of all time. All the other fiat gateways don't support ACH from my bank chain (which isnt a large national change) and I don't want to pay 15$ for wire transfers twice a month just to put 2k a month into crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:15:27
I feel like everytime we are in a correction/dip people are everywhere saying the recovery is right around the corner, and everytime we get the slightest bull run people are screaming that the correction is right around the corner.
Like, so far in crypto its either one side yelling or the other. Theres never any in between, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:18:54


Annnnnd you sound like a moron.
"Nobody really buys the dips".
"I totally buy the dips"
"You are stupid for having idle money ready to buy dips"
"Anybody who claims they held from 2014 till now is exaggerating"
"I hodled from 2014 to now".
You can't quite get any of your shit together. I think what happened here, is in your original comment you were making an attempt at coming across as a really wise and weathered investor. But you fucked it up and sounded stupid instead by claiming that buying low (which is rule  of smart investing) was something people couldn't manage to do because it was 'too hard'. People called you on it and now your feelings are hurt.
Thus leading you to try and tell us all about how epic you are and how long you have been around and how terrifyingly above average you are. Yeah man we get it. You are an ex military sniper with 10k confirmed kills, all your trades are perfect and your dad can beat up our dad.
Or, you could admit you said something stupid and stop trying so hard to look awesome on reddit. No one is buying it. So lets clarify this shit once for all so you can have a chance to escape with a shred of e-cred.
Buying dips is good.
Buying dips isn't difficult, it just requires general basic knowledge of how markets work.
Buying dips typically involves having fiat (or other available/tradeable crypto) available at the time of the dip (Mindblowing I know).
Finally, even if you don't; many of us have faith in Bitcoin to reach highs well above where it is now. Holding is it not nearly as painful for some of us as it seems to be for you. Not that this part matters, everyone believes different things, can't fault you for that.

I feel like if you are emotionally immature enough to let some mod on reddit hurt your feelings to the point of directing your investments, then you deserve to get wrecked and left bagholding BCH after that huge pump and dump.

Hate them with a passion.

Nah, I think that depends heavily on your financial success/level in everyday life. At $100 bitcoin I would buy 21 with spare money just to be in the millionth club. Even if it went to zero, just the fun of having 21 at the very least would be memorable and something worth such a small cost.
Same for a lot of other people too. You probably blew $2100 several times over the last time you went on vacation or to a casino. At a certain point, its worth it, just for the fun of it.

Rationale? No large company of note is going to want to be involved in possible anonymous money movement. Its not worth the risk for them. I thought we learned this years ago when Banks started closing accounts for having Coinbase deposits even though they were perfectly legal and above board?

I could stand this bear market to move sideways for a month or two.

I think even if you are wealthy, watching the peaks and valleys can be enthralling. Crypto is absolutely crazy, you had other subreddits basically reading obituaries for it at the bottom of that dip the other day. In a month we will probably have snapped right back.

Can someone point me to a replacement for this functionality? This sites real time updates price on BTC was really clutch when I wanted to check the satoshi value of $2700 or something like that.

Remember, all of this is opinion. I have no problem paying 25% tax on BTC earnings considering how lucrative this market is, and considering how many services that are available to me that are paid for by taxes.
Don't assume that everyone into crypto feels taxes are the devil.
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:07:56
Its a poor deal. The fees are higher on bitcoin ATMs, and the availability of Bitcoin atms is horrible worldwide. There are vast vast landmasses even in the U.S not to mention other countries where these aren't available. No one should want money flow into crypto to slow or be filtered through ATMS.
Localbitcoins is good for crypto and privacy. Any attempts to sabotage it and force control into the hands of the KYC companies should be taken extremely seriously and not ignored just because "We have a pretty terrible backup called Bitcoin ATMs".
Im not saying you are downplaying the thread here, but Im just worried people have grown so complacent that they aren't taking this seriously.

Wow, its painful how accurate this is. Im currently invested in BTC and BCC, but I also mentioned this on their subreddit, and got straight mauled. This is the first time Im considering un-investing in a coin because of its community.

I have heard tales of people who really thought this, but you are my first encounter of it personally. You really think that Coinbase is going to jump behind 2x eh? And that this is going to be the key to it becoming the dominant chain?
Fascinating. Can you (just for shits and giggles) tell me how you see it going from there? I mean, in your best case scenario, what happens after that? You expect every other exchange to do the same? All of them, Japanese ones and alllllll of them to abandon the core chain like domino's? But for Coinbase to be that first one eh?
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:06:20


I mean, this is exactly right... you realize that right? You realize that they are staying quiet because NO MATTER WHICH WAY people wont like it. There's 2 fairly sizable sides here. There's no need to rustle the jimmies of either and start the lawsuits. Let the market decide (**And we fucking will**) and when the obvious happens, they can move forward and we can laugh at the fork. No one will be able to accuse them of choosing sides or favoring anyone in any sort of lawsuit. It will be the market that decided. And all the whiners can do is cry over it.

What? Have you ever used LBC? 5% or so isnt uncommon. If we have these services popping up and managing to exchange BTC to FIAT or something and its as low as .5% the market will swarm all over it. Especially if its actually safe via escrow or something. 
Im going to guess most of the posts shitting on this service are competitors or astroturfing idiots. No one in crypto should be against the decentralization of cashing out your crypto. Its good for the entirety of Crypto.

Look at their levels compared to BTC, and have a look at... you know, the rest of the coins. Theres more than 3 on the market. They have clearly CLEARLY been on a decline for about 5 days now. There are some standouts that have risen versus the red tide, but not a lot. Most are down.

Too huge to allow people to store a form of wealth in crypto and not allow law enforcement to legally steal it from you.

Last six months? It didnt even hit 7k until like November. That means a HUGE amount of the volume of the entirety of 2017 traded November through Dec?
Maybe its true, Im not going to check, but thats bizarre. And it means far more people than I expected jumped on the bandwagon in November. I mean, BTC started 2017 at like $1100 or thereabouts. 10 months of trading to get to 7k and it was still that backloaded?
Insane. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:58:16
Yes every exchange that allows ACH will always wait a day or two after it clears your bank before officially considering it clear. They want to drastically lower the chance that you can reverse that charge. So expect them to get your money and hold it like 2-3 business days before 'officially' recognizing your transfer.
You cant escape this as far as I know with any exchange unless you deposit via Wire, which is more expensive.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:28:04


Doesn't matter that they are taking issue with it. Thats how its going to be. That's how the other exchanges so far have revealed they will handle it, and so will coinbase in the end. And its all about protecting their asses.

You arent paying close enough attention. They did say they will announce naming details later, but notice how they did not say they will be trading or supporting the S2x version at all....
In fact, the only thing we can be sure of is: They WILL be trading the traditional (core) chain uninterrupted. And that they will announce the naming procedures soon. But at this point they have already told on themselves. If they were going to give the S2x the name of Bitcoin, then that would mean they would be trading it day 1. But they never stated that. More bad news incoming for the S2x fans.

Don't let anti-intellectuals sour you on technical analysis. The best advice anyone on reddit can give you is to not take advice from Subreddits.

I think this is over 6 years away easily. Probably closer to 10. And it won't be until that point that I expect the explosion in crypto where all the average/dumb money from the masses starts to flow in.
So long as the average person is still calling 1-800 numbers to get help with the iPhone password they set themselves a week ago, but already forgot.... I don't think mainstream crypto is anywhere NEAR today. Shit like Ledgers and Paper Wallets and keys and whatnot would give those people heart attacks.

Anyone saber rattling about energy consumption and bitcoin is already playing a game of whataboutism tbh. There are such bigger things to pay attention to than fucking bitcoin that its crazy. Its like trying to address corruption and unfairness in U.S. banking by focusing solely on overdraft fees on checking accounts..... Its like the absolute smallest portion of the overall problem, yet all of your focus is on it anyway.
Energy consumption and whatnot is a big problem, but bitcoin mining makes up such an absolutely microscopic fucking percentage of this problem that its almost amusing watching it get all this attention while the people focusing on it swear there's no other underlying reason for their laser focus. These folks just don't like crypto, and energy consumption is their one vine to hold on to to justify their hate of it.
