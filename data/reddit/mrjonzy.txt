You can buy drugs and other illegal items with bitcoins. Soon you'll be able to pay prostitutes in BTC. After that the merchants will follow.
There is no problem... it just takes time for the market to grow.

And regarding  Usually when you make a transaction in the real-world the confirmation takes a few seconds to happen.
EFT's, even the fastest, take several days, sometimes weeks, and cost exorbitant fees. They can be canceled or challenged at multiple points in the chain, and are subject to taxes, plus government and private regulations.
Physical transfers of currency can take place in a few seconds. But that, too, has problems... many of which bitcoin solves.

I've been using Dwolla for several months. Never had an issue, except that it's infuriatingly slow. Your banking info isn't revealed to MtGox, only Dwolla, and they clear funds through a US credit union. That made it "safe enough" for me. For $20, though, I don't think it'd be worth your time.

I tried to transfer my balance out on 7/29. They never showed up. BlockExplorer says the address has never been used. Now he says my balance is 0. I hope Tom Williams dies a miserable, painful and lonely death.
