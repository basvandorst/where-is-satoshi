If you don’t mind, could you explain a little better what would be like doing this weekly buys? Right now I have an amount of 0.305 bitcoins, and I would like to do some trades, but I’m not sure how.

You having a lot of experience on that, what do you think of my situation.
I used to just hedl for a long time, then there was the price drop to $5500 a week ago (maybe more) and I still didn't do shit. Yesterday after reading the hacking news I saw the price dropping like crazy and assumed the situation would happen again, sold around at $7900. Now, I pretend to buy again, would you wait to see if it's gonna get around this price again or maybe just buy already and HODL?
Thanks in advice, and you have an amazing story.

Why do you think that? People waking up for the news?

Got it, as well in bitcoin, no explanations needed. I mean, if you believe in bitcoin and think it will grow up even more as a cryptocurrency I would do it. Maybe keep one knife just because lmao

Have you consider trying to sell everything for $ then investing? Idk how it works if you want to get your money out of the steam, I guess you need to make the trade somewhere else, right?
