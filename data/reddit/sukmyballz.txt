Big news Satoshi was found this weekend, he posted to usenet about bitcoin 2002, 7 years before his white paper from the NL. It was connected by 247 News to Professor Lenstra the creator of ECC crypto.
DR LENSTRA IS SATOSHI and most likely he will be assassinated soon (my opinion).

Your reviews are biased they pay you, you have aff links on your site.
1 Player I played in a high stakes game, got paid within an hour.
i Bitcoin was moderate stakes game, didn't win.
Seals was all micro bet tables and it took almost a day to get my coin back.
Nitrogen was the worse, with tiny bet tables.
The tables looked identical on SwC/1Player/iBitcoin
I guess you don't like the video on 1Player, I found the site pretty simple to get info, and the main thing to me is tables, if a poker room has 50/100 blinds and people playing, then as long as you get your money out fast, that's all that matters to me, how much per hand can I play for and will I get my dough back. 1 Player was way ahead of everyone with the iBitcoin way behind, the tiny per hand action on both Swc and Nitrogen means I won't waste my time there.
Any other high stakes rooms?
From your site it looks like betcoin is using the same program as SwC and 1 Player. How is the blinds at betcoin.
That's all I care about, what are the blinds, it determines my average hourly win and how soon to get my coin back. 1 Player has the best for that and their room looks like exact same script as betcoin and swc.
