Are you sure a system where some people control others with threats and use of violence wont be corrupted? Why is there even a need for such a hierachical way of organising society? Wouldnt a society work, where in everyone was equal, and no-one was allowed to iniate violence against others?

These things have been tried with varying results afaik. But you are welcome to start a buisness with like minded people to pursue this endevaur. I mean, what stands in the way of living/working like this today?
Would you be unable to respect another mans wishes, if he found a lake, which nobody knew about, and claimed it as his? If he tried a hostile take over that would be another story. But are you saying this is how human beings generally behave? If they are prone to hostile takeovers what would your solution be?
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:41:26
We enforce it ourselves. No laws does not mean no rules. If you are a violent type, you might have a hard time finding a job, getting insurance or something similar. Thats the way in which the rules are enforced, you do not get to participate in society to the same degree as people who behave properly. Its very effective to my knowledge since people are driven by incentives.

For all we know ebay/paypal chose not to deal with bitcoin due to widespread chargeback scams. But it doesent really matter what their reasons are, if they dont want people selling bitcoin or bitcoin related stuff on their website they are within their right of doing so. Its their site. But thats besides the point.
You dont roll over by using a competitor, in fact thats a giant screw you to ebay in this case. I mean you cant send a louder message than using an alternative that is bitcoin friendly.

My first guess would be that copyright laws etc. are different for each country. There are different types of licenses, and copyright holders take varying stances. Furthermore there are various instiutions in each country that is set up to take a piece of the pie whenever copyrighted material is displayed legally. So its basically a giant legal mess wherein no-one can figure out who has to pay how much to whom, so it becomes a stalemate and the shows and movies etc. are not being shared or shown across the world for this reason for long periods of time

The problem is that what you refer to as teamwork is theft and force. Any government program or funding is backed by taxes or debt that someone somewhere is going to be forced to pay. I dont know how else to explain it. But calling government programs teamwork is absurd because its anything but, given that people are forced to pay for them, and that the established and politically connected usually get first priority on the money and the jobs

This is not always true. Productive workers are better for profitabitlity than non-productive, therefore there is a demand for productive people which requires companies to compete on higher wages in order to attract productive and also skilled labour.
Do you have any theories as to what causes unemployment? It wouldnt be fair to use it in your argument without taking a look at possible causes
I do not agree that so called private ownership of land and resources is a bad thing. First and foremost there are environmental gains from having private ownership of land and resources, as far as i can tell. If you own land, you take care of it, lest it is of no value to you, in which case you might just sell it, meaning someone else who value it will take it over, and take care of it. Does that make sense?
It is also simpler to have private property or private ownership of the land, compared to attempting to create something called public ownership, which i can imagine gets over complicated as problems begin to arise. Who should take care of it, who should pay for taking care of it, who gets money for the resources, how should that money be spent etc. Private ownership is far superior, as the owner decides and have to live with the benefits or consequences of how he works the land...
My only objection to taxation is that it is forced, or involuntary. I dont mind the ideas behind taxation, that it is supposed to pay for roads, the less fortunate etc. Im fine with that. I use the roads, or acknowledge their need.. I also dont mind helping the less fortunate, but when we begin forcing other people to pay for this it becomes a moral question. Should anyone be allowed to iniate violence against others in order to solve social problems? What about possible "moral hazards" where the people whom we allow to iniate violence against others, starts. getting. out. of control. Throughout history we have witnessed time and again, what happens when government gets out of control, and even the US and European nations are not imune, their governments also continue to grow in size and become a bigger and bigger burdon.

To my knowledge that was never proven. There was a series of attacks vs betcoin dice who accepted large deposits with 0 confirmations. It was argued one with only a small amount of hashing power not only could pull the attack of, but he could also make it look like it was someone else.

i dont think its so bad, even tho miners are pooling together its still decentralized. Miners buy equipment for more than $10,000 these days, they are not interested in participating in a pool which destabilises the network. They want to mine as fast and effeciently as possible, so no double spend crap, they will leave immidiately for another pool then

@_date: 2014-01-09 08:51:45
no it doesent, its sensationalist, miners will make the correct choices, what is the problem with gigahish.io?
thing is, it seems so desperate, too desperate, in reality there is nothing wrong with miners pooling together resulting in consolidation of the hashrate, as long as the pool isnt acting malicious. gigahash.io is? miners will just leave. So begin reporting if gigahash.io is acting maliciously, not if they obtain 50% or more of the hashrate.

Gigahash.io does not own all their hashing power, it still consists of individual miners contributing their share. They can leave if they want, there are plenty alternatives. Besides, the blockchain is virtually transparent, double spend attacks are detected pretty fast. You dont have to worry about them unless you are doing it wrong. Heres a question for you as well. Can you proove the risk and amount of double spend attacks increase as miners consolidate their hashing power?

This is a rule of nature you cannot change. However civilization has come a long way and we interact (read: compete) peacefully. Except for one institution which leftists among others keeps dear. The state. It uses violence to achive it ends and its what stands in the way of a truly peaceful and prosperous society. But thats a long story


This is the reason why taxes, welfare etc. are bad. Because you end up hogging peoples money, forcing them to contribute to xyz, so they will cling to their remaining money every chance they get. With forced participation in charity and welfare, you end up creating a cynical society where people already believe they've contributed more than enough, and end up taking advantage of as many welfare programs as they can, even tho they might not need it. There is also the issue that money government hands out more often than not lacks oversight where expenses increases and increases while the problems remain unsolved.

You comment is noted. Dont think looking like a jerk is much better. My point is people with 50% or more of the hashrate is not a problem per definition, it only becomes a problem when they start using the hashrate for malicious purposes. There is nothing shocking about a pool with 30% or 50% or more of the hashrate. What would be shocking is if they started doing malicious activity with that kind of hashrate.

Localbitcoins have existed some time now, id say its pretty safe. However if they close, you loose your coins. You should look into alternative ways to keep bitcoins, i prefer blockchain.info, but there are other ways of doing it. Keep in mind most people loose their bitcoins because they use a weak password, or because someone was able to obtain it via a keylogger or something similar. This means you have to be carefulish on which computers you access your bitcoins etc. Only do it on private or really trusted ones, on a trusted network. I hope you get the idea.

However it was mostly debt financed, and we havent even witnessed the true consequences yet. Anyway thats a different topic of discussion. I dont understand how you can say that flow of capital will be slower than neccesary ie. damaging, if its saved up in money that increases in value.

I wonder how you think. If you believe its possible to objectively state something without having an opinion on it? What i mean is I didnt say wether or not the monopoly was good or bad, but merely they had a monopoly.
What do you think about the monopoly? Why do you think people should be subsizied if they live in an area that is otherwise not economically viable. Because thats what you are saying. That people should be forced to subsidize others who live in places where for example mail cannot be delivered. If you choose to live far out, you also choose to drive into town to get your mail yourself.  You dont choose for someone to enforce a monopoly, so they can rack up prices on everyone, just so you can fucking skip your trip to town and get your mail while you sit at your remote location resort
And to your edit. Benjamin franklin existed 200 years ago. Did he predict any of the things that are happening today? Did he predict we could send money across the globe, almost instantly, thanks to bitcoin. How about communnication, did he predict we could talk to anyone almost anywhere, instantly, thanks to the internet. What about books and information. Did he predict we would walk around with a device that could instantly help you understand concept such as astro physics, on the go, anywhere what the fuck. Why are you talking about benjamin franklin`? To be honest he had the chance of doing it right. That means not sowing the seeds for an enormous totalitarian state. The constitution was an excuse to have a government. Its from the constitution which failed to limit the government, that this quasi world police state has evolved:) Well at least he tried. He thought a few words on a piece of paper would be able to limit and control the most awesome power in the world. The power to iniate violence against others. But of course it isnt going to be limited. Everyone who gets near it will attempt to use it for their own good. Most poeple will anyway. Thats why you keep getting new laws, new taxes, agencies etc. Because they just cant help it. It will collaps in a giant implosion tho because no society can bear the burden of a bloated government. You see america is no different than ancient empires. they all collapse from within because their goddamn government end up being out of control. Benjamin franklin should have seen this. He should have argued for a pure, anarcho-capitalist society, where government based on the use of force is not tolerated. Yea

Speculation is not hurting bitcoin. At least you cant do anything about it. Bitcoin is in its infancy years, so naturally most of the demand is based on speculation. People are not afraid to spend their bitcoins. Well, naturally they arent going to spend them ALL. The further they increase in value, the more money people have, therefor they have bigger incentive to spend some because they are now richer than previously.

Is the 5th decimal really neccesary, how much is that? Its less than a cent right? I think it makes the pricing even more confusing. And since you cater to the whole world, why not give people the option of showing prices in their own local currency, however, they pay with bitcoin at the checkout
@_date: 2013-12-31 06:20:30

I disagree. Human beings might thrive with freedom, and struggle in slavery. What creates the monsters, is violence, and the people who are allowed to initate it against others. That power is too great, and throughout history the powers that be have tried to excuse why they need to be able to do this. They need to be able to initate violence against you in order to fight crime. They need to be able to initate violence against you in order to fight poverty. They need the to be able to iniate violence against you in order to build roads and so on. So what makes us subservient to the elite? First of all, they feed us, 2nd of all, they fill us with bullshit. But we can feed ourselves, be free and knowledgable, not needing the so called elite (the state etc.) to build roads, to fight crime, to protect etc.

Be careful. First of all you are setting yourself up for scamming, by appearing so naive. And before you even attempt to get that amount of bitcoin, make sure you have a proper way of storing them, no method is really better than the other if you take the neccesary precations. Every method can end up with you loosing the coins if you dont know about the pitfalls of each. Then id suggest going to an exchange. The amount you save by going to potential shady people is nothing compared to loosing it all. Obtaining the bitcoin through letigimate/official channels is better imo. I use to pay 10% fees on my bitcoin purchases, because that was the merchant i felt safe with, and my investment have still done very well. Now im part of an exchange and can get the bitcoin directly, so no worries. Anyway, good luck, and consider getting alot less if this is the first time you dip into bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:11:03
This will get changed soon enough. The market doesent like mBTC, otherwise it would have already been adopted. It could go on for a few months maybe more, but one day someone will come up with a proper new denomination merchants and shoppers alike will enjoy and adopt. So far the best proposal ive seen is B-notation. XB0 XB3 XB8 etc.
Its ISO compliant, simple and easy to understand. XB0 is merely a proper way to write satoshis. XB8 would be the "proper" way to write BTC/XBT. XB3 are currently called Mili Bitcoin, which will get awkward by the day, as the exchange rate rises, because at $100 or more, 1 mili bitcoin does not seem as mili as the name sugggests

To be honest, the "argument" you made is not good enough to use on a new denomination. That its widely understood does not neccesarly make it right for bitcoin. In the end, when the currency is deflated, you will be using microbitcoins everyday, that doesnt seem right. Youd need something more neutral. Dollar is neutral. Bitcoin is neutral. But unfortunately Bitcoin is worth so much now, that it can no longer be used effectively to price things. And Milibitcoins and Microbitcoins are not neutral enough names to be used as a names for a new denomination. They imply insignificance although they could potentially be worth hundreds of dollars themselves one day

Noone uses mbtc because its a really bad denomination, and if you decided to use it, before you know it, you have to change denomination again. Moving the comma 4 times now, will provide for a smooth ride the next year or two if not more, while the currency keeps deflating. Think something worth 0.2000 btc will be priced 2000 btc, and as the currency deflates will go lower, and lower untill a comma would have to be used again, in which case it would be logical to move the comma another 4 times on BTC again

The cryptography is actually a pretty serious one because it exposes the major "FLAW" in bitcoin. Or it is what makes bitcoin incredibly centralized in one respect.

Or do you know of any way to proect yourself, as a bitcoiner big or small, against the cryptography being broken? What could people do in this case?
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:00:42
It shouldnt be mBTC tho, because it could potentially be worth hundred if not thousands of dollars in the future. Need something more neutral, like B-notation. B-notation similar to mathematic/scientific E-notation uses a number in the denomination to determine how many places the comma has been moved. XB0 Is a normal bitcoin. XB3 is a so-called mBTC, and XB8 is a satoshi. People can call them what they want, since XB3 is neutral, but it gets easy for merchants and customers to denominate how ever they please, and easily get an idea of the price. mBTC uBTC etc. is not good enough imo, because it requires more memorialization in order to understand prices (how many mBTC to 1 BTC again?) etc. With b notation just divide the price by ten^x. Its easy for developers to deal with, easy for merchants to denominate (there is more freedom), and easy for customers to quickly understand the weight of a price regardless of denomination the merchant choose

If you purchase bitcoin from a norwegian buisness or exchange they have to add VAT to it. I dont know how much it is in Norway but in Denmark its 25% so i imagine its similar. That means you pay the exchange rate+25%  tax. This stance basicially means there will be no exchanges in Norway

An exchange is a hub where Person A can meet Person B to exchange bitcoins. Im not sure about coinbase, but i think they are an exchange. Depending on the amount you got, id say its pretty safe to leave the bitcoin on coinbase, but you should look into more decentralized ways of storing the bitcoin, as they can potentially get lost if coinbase closes down, or gets hacked, or their servers malfunction etc.

I am personally getting what i can at this point, because i dont see any serious threats to bitcoin on the horizon. I recognize the price might go lower tomorrow but its a chance im willing to take. Of course i dont insta buy everything, i try to time-cost average as i think they call it. I spent 75% of my budget around this price, and will wait a little now to see where we are headed. In a weeks time i will probably buy more regardless of what the price is

The payment system embedded in bitcoin is just a basic one. In the future there could be companies who provide faster and just as secure payment proccessing. Due to the scale of the network and the need to check and confirm transactions with crypto-currencies, i dont think its possible to outperform bitcoins confirmation speed in any significant way. This will be up to 3rd party companies to provide. Google wallet already has alot of users, if they adopt bitcoin they can maintain the transactions and confirm them instantly using their reputation. They keep the bitcoins somewhere safe and promise to pay them out when people want to. But if you keep it in their ecosystem they can provide instant and very secure payment processing with any merchant that signs up with them etc. I dont think any alt-coin would be able to rival this, so this is not how bitcoin is going to be beat. I think it will be on a security level as that is the most important imo. But bitcoin is not weak by any standards yet, so alt-coin are not to be feared atm. imo.

Its not that interesting, because the price is more or less back to the level before the hearing, and to be honest the hearing is not as significant as the market may they think (dont shoot me..) because bitcoin can live on regardless of restrictions in the US or not, it can even live on in the US if there are restrictions or its considered contraband

How will communcal goods exist in a society with private property? Either a person will own the land, or someone will be free to use it, and become the owner.

@_date: 2013-11-19 13:30:20
Bitcoin is not a science. Lets not try to make it a science. We are supposed to make it easy to use and understand.
I dont agree that SI is understood globally, or that depends on what you mean. How many milibitcoins to one BTC? How many micro bitcoins to one BTC? Not many can answer that without looking it up.
Cons: SI System the comma is first moved 3 places. Then another 3, but bitcoin is only currently divisible with up to 8 decimal places so it doesent add up. Moving it 4 places, and then another 4 places sometime in the future and you are done. You will arrive at satoshis.
Cons: 1 Milibitcoin is already more than 5 dollars, so if merchants want to sell items worth less than that they have to begin using commas again, and it will be that much shorter time until they have to begin using leading zeroes and commas, which was the goal to avoid in the first place
Cons: SI system is unsexy. Milibitcoins does not sound good, niether does micro bitcoins. And it will get worse as the currency deflates, because purchasing a house for 1000 micro bitcoins does not feel right.

I explained what i meant by netural. But let me try again. Micro and mili imply insignificance, which is a problem because they can potentially be worth hundreds of dollars in the future. Keep in mind we are talking about a denomination. That could be traded on exchanges potentially, so the argument about billions, millions etc. is not relevant. It could apply to the denomination as well. "I have millions of x". 
And do you know what direction you are taking the discussion when you begin to say i think people are dumb? Its not... constructive
Your last part is just sigh. I dont plan on telling people what to call bitcoins, im not good with names:) But i plan on starting discussion at least on how to improve the way in which prices are presented to consumers, but also how merchants can easily price things. So please stop leading the discussion in a unserious way, because i dont think people are dumb, i dont want to tell them what to do, but there is a problem with things priced in BTC and there is a need for a new denomination, and the SI system is not good enough, you still havent commented on any of this, other than saying "it is". I gave arguments for why i believe its not, feel free to discuss them

Bitcoin is not an all in one package. You cant create a system that solve every problem regarding global trade. In a sense the payment system that comes with bitcoin is just a very basic one, that allows for the transfer of wealth without a middle man. This is part of what makes it great. But if bitcoin becomes popular enough, and bitcoins basic payment system no longer can accomodate the trade that is being done, people will create buisnesses and attempt to solve the problems on top of bitcoin. Seriously. All paypal had to do was add a new database that tracked amount of bitcoins per user, and they could have instant and thousands transactions per second, using their current infrastructure. I know its not as simple as that, but a company like paypal it would be trivial to add the currency once the demand is there

3 places is not enough because you will come up with a new denomination that will require a comma when trying to use it for pricing things. Moving it the extra spot 99% of the prices will not have a comma which makes it very readable first of all, but it means when the exchange rate has increased further, you can move the comma one final time another 4 spaces and you will be done, because then you will be using satoshis
take a look at coingig.com or coinrx.com who have their prices in x.xxxx for example viagra on coinrx.com is 0.0016 btc. If moving the comma 4 times on BTC, the price on viagra will be 16 BTC. It makes it much more comprehensible

This is getting rediculous. Its an idea that he is welcome to try. If buisnesses decide to adopt it, meaning they screen their customers before doing buisness with them so be it.

Another thing is when bitcoin price starts fluctuating people leave the bitcoin shares etc. because there is more money to be made daytrading bitcoins directly. This results in share prices falling. Then there is the fact that the large bitcoin shares exchanges have been in turmoil for a long time which also without a doubt impacts share prices negatively. So if you want to buy bitcoin shares, now is the time, because the bitcoin rally and volatility seems to be over for now, and people will soon enough begin seeking refuge in bitcoin shares etc. seeking more profit again

Please think it through for a sec. Address validation will be a voluntary system where buyers and sellers can opt-in with details about an adress. Its a database which hosts information on adresses. Buisnesses dont have an incentive to submit info about you and an adress you used, unless you want them to, otherwise that would be bad for buisness. Imagine if it was found out, some buisness is giving away info about you to 3rd party. In fact most places on the net, the companies specifically state that your personal info is not given away to 3rd party because no one fucking likes that. So this coin/adress validation thing, it will be for some, but it wont be the end of bitcoin. And even if it were to become some kind of government policy, where you register with your bitcoin adress, so be it, you can still purchase from the black market using an unregistered bitcoin adress, because you could just go over seas to get some bitcoin... Or you could get some from your local area, there is no way the government could control the population to such a degree that no one can spend bitcoins from an unidentified adress. No way thats possible, and that is due to bitcoins nature of being pseudonomous.

Essentially it wont be that much. If VAT was applicable, it would only be when consumers go into bitcoin. That means they can get the bitcoins from overseas cheap, and still be using them like normal currency domestically. This is what people will do if bitcoins take hold, and i think the authorities will realise by seeing that people just buy the bitcoin overseas, that the VAT is not giving them any revenue, and they might as well remove it again. There will also be the bitcoin advocates who will use the courts and the media to have the VAT removed. There was an example in Denmark, where they increased taxes on unhealthy foods. The result was people drove to germany to do the shopping. The danish stores and merchants were complaining, and eventually the taxes got removed

What are you talking about? For all we know they are just miners, happily building hashing power because they enjoy it. At least they are spending alot of money on it. How much money do you pay per gigahash these days? What about electricity etc. If they were to attempt something malicious, it would only temporarily hurt bitcoin. And if you are really worried, i suggest your obtain your own cheap little asic and run it indefinately. Doesent matter wether its actually making your money or not, what matters is you add to the total pool and thus take away from for example gigahash.io. But to be honest i dont think they will try anything sinister. Someone hypothesised that the double spends allegly from gigahash.io - its not proven yet afaik, further investigation needs to be done - are actually a form of defence, because sites like betcoin are ddosing the blockchain, and by exploiting them this way, they are being forced to adopt another buisness model. Anyway, thats an entirely different discussion.

The problem is in most cases after the exchange rate hit &gt;$200 you end up with alot of arbitrary zeroes when pricing things in bitcoin, moving the comma 4 decimal places will allow for pricing in bitcoin without the need for commas at all. Bitcoin again start growing toward the $300,$400 mark until the comma will be moved a final time another 4 places landing on satoshis

There is going to be alot more bitcoin in circulation by that time. And given the increase in price, difficulty of mining etc. people are being alot more serious about protecting/keeping them. It didnt use to be like this, and there are estimates suggesting more than a million coins are lost. The new coins being minted will get a different treatment, and it will provide much more inflation so to speak. Therefor the price could even stay stable for a very long time, even tho demand is increasing. Right now, $22,500 worth of bitcoins are created every ~10 minute.

A place like bitcoinity should be the last one to switch if a new denomination gains momentum. Exchanges or mining pools could be one of the first, but also merchants- The only real benefit of adopting a new denomination is for merchants to have a better ability to price things and for consumers to better read, understand and compare prices. There is also the psychological barrier in purchasing bitcoin when seeing the exchange rate at $1,000 compared to $1 or less depending on what denomination is used. I personally feel mBTC is a bad denomination, its already worth too much, and merchants will have to use leading zero when selling certain things, as the exchange rate rises this will get worse and worse. mBTC is also an awkward name considering it can be worth $1,000 or more in the future.

There is no conspiracy. Due to the nature of reddit and wikipedia its to be expected that companies attempt to 'infiltrate' and spend money to get attention and or change articles that reflect them in a bad light. Furthermore, the most common beliefs usually manifests on wikipedia articles, for example Bitcoins deflationary nature will cause problems with investing and general consumer activity but its been proven wrong and again. But its still the most common belief and its why it keeps being emphasized on wikipedia. This is just an observation

This sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. You should not have several devices hooked up to your main stash of bitcoins. I have no objections for keeping them in the cloud, but when you access them, is when you take the risk. The more devices you use to access it, and the frequenter you access the stash the more vulnerable you are.

Bitcoin is completely decentralized.

And this kind of policy is still years away even if it were to become a thing
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:57:07
Its not good enough. The denominations need to be more neutral. Micro BTC imply insignifiance, when in reality, at some day they can be worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars. This means you will be using micro btc even when purchasing houses or cars, or even when large companies purchasing each other. Feels wrong. And i believe is one of the reasons no places have really switched yet. The reason to switch to a new denomination is to do away with the leading zeroes and commas when trying to price things in BTC because it gets unneccarily complicated otherwise. But most sites still stick to pricing things in BTC resulting in prices like 0.0023 and 0.0232 etc. which is kind of unpleasant. So i in a sense there is a need of a new denomination, but the knee-jerk SI based ones are insufficent.

You can have systems that have bad protection against corruption. The government will always have bad protection against corruption because its hierachical. It is allowed to initiate violence against others, but others arent allowed to initate violence against it. That makes its fundamentally flawed as the evil and corrupt will flock to the instiutition and attempt to use it for their own benefit, wether or not there is a layer of democracy between the people and those who make the laws etc.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:32:05
The reason being the change has to happen sooner or later. Converting to mbtc is a poor solution, thats also why it hasnt happened yet, moving it 4 places at once removes the need for a comma when pricing, because you can go as low as ~4 cents. What costs 4 cents now a days... Anyway if its neccesary, you can still apply a comma and price below 4 cents. Anyway the comma on BTC has to be moved sooner or later, Satoshi recognized this when criticized about bitcoins deflationary nature. He said the comma could be moved when the time arrived. Rather than moving it 1 or two spaces, and comming up with a new and silly denomination called MILI (the SI system has not been applied to any successful currency as far as im aware, and mili also sounds silly). 
Moving it 4 places allows for pricing in bitcoin without needing a comma at all, giving freedom to merchants and easy readiblity for 'consumers'. Eventually, when the exchange rate has has increased enough, the comma will be moved another final 4 places and we will be using Satoshis. It means only 2 times the comma has to be moved, rather than how many times the SI approach you suggest will call for.

I dont understand what you are saying. As far as i understand it, fiat money typically do not have people ordering it to have value, as such, but they order buisnesses to accept it, which gives it value. No one is ordering buisnesses to take bitcoin tho. So in that sense its not fiat or valueless, because its used voluntarily. Some people will argue the only thing giving bitcoin life is the prohibition of recreational drugs, forcing people to use bitcoin indirectly if they want to buy and sell via the internet, but i still say bitcoin is a superior currency and bound to be used even under total free market conditions.
