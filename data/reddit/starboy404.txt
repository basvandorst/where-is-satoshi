"real money or wealth" None of which you have. I have places in Hong Kong, England and East Coast, and I can prove it. How about you fuck off you fucking nobody? You looked at my history and saw  I "sell shoes? No, dipshit, I wear them. I buy 1k shoes and room full of them. You're the kind that buys at Walmart. Go home, you have no clue of your place in this world. You're a nobody. Keep saying piker, wanne btc “entrepreneur”. LMAOOOOOOOOO

When it reaches $10, your purchase of 5 BTC ($31630) will be worth $50.
You're dumb as shit.

OOOOOOOOOOF, even more jealous of your 6300 to 4800 now
@_date: 2018-11-13 05:11:27
yeah, no. $100 into $308 is pretty fucking shabby when it has to go to the ALL TIME high of 19650. It's at 6300.

I have more money than you ever will. Trust me buddy.
You're fucking retarded if you think this is an "investment". You probably spent the rest of what little you have, like a little sheep buying lottery tickets hoping they won't be homeless in 5 years.
 You jumped on the cryto bandwagon when it got mainstream. You're nothing.

damn thats all you got? pathetic really, kys

OOF, bitcoin dropped to 5,700. The only salt here is my dry salty balls that needs some sucking from you. Get them nice and wet for me. Put them in your mouth, girl.
You're the kind who bought bitcoin near peak when it got mainstream  to buy btc. Jealous? I have more money than you ever will and I can prove it. You? How much btc do you have? I'd say a couple thousand at best and you're clinging onto it for dear life because you're poor as shit and hope btc will reverse you being a fuckup at life.

Truth right here. People in too much denial. Seriously, its hilarious. Trying to convience everyone "HODL BROTHERS IT WILL HIT 20K IN 2025"
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:26:20
A made up ratio?
Where are the numbers coming from?
Why don't I put in my own numbers? Lets say its 50% chance it will be worth 4k in 5 years and 50% chance of being worth lets say 5k. 50% to lose 1.3k and 50% to lose 2.3k
Also opportunity cost of that 6.3k that could be used to actively grow instead of sitting away hoping hell freezes over you and you get a lambo.
Dream on kid, keep trading your $5 of dogecoin and think you know economics.
 Do you see how fucking retarded you sound?
