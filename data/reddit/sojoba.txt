Just political theatre. This is exactly what the fed has already been doing years. Quantitative easing, bailouts, etc, all are just fancy forms of printing money. But yeah ignore the man behind the curtain.  Trump's obviously the problem.

It's important to note that the reason gold confiscation was 'necessary' was because of the gold standard. There was a limit on how much money the mint could print so they needed more gold in order to print more money.  We no longer have a gold standard so it's very unlikely confiscation would happen again. If we ever returned to a gold standard then the price of gold would skyrocket so high that the gold bugs would still make a killing when they handed it in, more than justifying their investment.

It's just a pretense for more regulation

"fdic is impossible with crypto because it cannot provide any support at all for a currency they do not control the creation of" Look at the gold markets. Gold is not created by the banks but paper gold still allows for fractional reserve practices.

You dont have to create bitcoin out of thin air. Fractional reserve banking doesnt require printing new money. You just have to move the existing money supply around so that it looks like there's more than there is. In short, you pool all the bitcoin deposits together and then loan out a certain percentage of the pool. Because the loans come out of the same pool that the depositor's withdraws come from, it creates the illusion of more supply.

I'm not saying that they are selling imaginary gold. Yes, the gold traded on the Comex is technically a derivative and those contracts are usually cash settled. But this doesn't change the fact that the value of those contracts is derived from the physical metal it represents.  
The value of outstanding contracts far exceeds the value of the physical reserves. 
Because it's the contracts that are traded and not the physical reserves this creates the illusion of more supply.

I'm a bit confused by the part where he talks about a node "attaching" itself to a block. How does a node attach itself to a block?

diamonds are a bad analogy for a number of reasons.  But even if you think that it's a fair comparison then you'd still have to believe that someone had a monopoly on gold. Theres no evidence for this  Furthermore the market supports these gold statistics. If i buy a diamond and sell it back to the dealer I get about 30% of what i paid for it. If i buy gold and sell it back i get 95% back. This is very strong evidence that the market sets the real price for both gold. Where is the evidence of this gold monopoly? I just don't see it but maybe you know something i don't?

I'm interested in your theory that gold is more abundant than it appears. Do you care to elaborate? When you say that the "gold industry" creates the illusion of scarcity, are you suggesting that mining companies are hoarding gold off the books to make the above ground supply seem lower than it truly is? It seems to me that in order to create the illusion of scarcity,  someone would have to be willingly hoarding gold against their own financial interest.  Who would stockpile something if they knew they could sell it in the market for more than it's actually worth? It doesn't make sense to me but I'm curious to hear more about your reasoning.

Being able to produce it is one thing.  being able to produce it profitably is another. The amount of energy required to produce gold through nuclear fission is so high that it would never be economically feasible to do so.

I said it's misleading not that the numbers are wrong. i tried to explain why it's misleading in my last comment but let me elaborate. 
1. you are talking about gold value in relation to dollars. Asume that the dollar value of gold went up but the rate of mining went down. in this case you could presumably have less gold being mined at the same time that the rate of mining in terms of dollar value went up. this would make it seem like a ton of new gold was being mined when in reality the rate of mining had actually gone down.  
2. Added gold supply isnt the same as inflation and it must be viewed in relation to the overall supply of above ground stock. Furthermore it s not very meaningful to try and compare inflation rates across financial instruments when you peg that inflation to one of the instruments being analyzed. It's much better to use a neutral measuring stick like oil for example. 1 ounce of gold buys almost the exact same amount of oil that it did 50 years ago.
3. Gold has outperformed the us dollar significantly over the past century.  For this reason it would be more accurate to say that gold is deflationary (relative to the dollar) rather than inflationary.  The complete opposite of what your comment proposes.

how much will those tech companies be worth 100 years from now? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:39:55
This is incredibly misleading. This amount is less than 2% of the above ground supply and it's a rate of gold expansion that has been remarkably consistent for centuries. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:13:27
I agree that you never know what the future might hold. But the likelihood of free energy is very small. As the supply of energy expanded so too would the economy itself. This would keep demand for energy high and most likely keep it costly. I suppose free energy is possible, but it's certainly not a good foundation for investment decisions.

This is btc sub so i dont expect people to agree but if you think about it honestly you'll see that gold has more than a few advantages over bitcoin as a store of value. 1. it's more private 2. it's tangible 3. it has a long history 4. central banks and other powerful groups have an interest in keeping gold's value high and will use their influence to support it. 5. Gold doesn't rely on an algorithm that's under constant threat of obsolescence because of competing cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. 6. Gold mining doesn't compete for other resources (electricity, gpus) as heavily as crypto and therefore doesn't disrupt the economy as severely.
