The problem is that when you have it both ways it stays an "ok" solution for both until one becomes dominant because their goals are diametrically opposed. 
Investors want BTC to continually raise in value as fast as possible, whereas merchants and consumers want the price to be stable so they can actually use the currency. 
The problem with continuing in this manner is that the continual boom and bust will drive merchants and consumers away from using the currency, and when the currency can't actually be used to trade something of value it inherently becomes less valuable and BTC can die off as a currency altogether. Sure, currencies will take its place but the same thing will happen again, unless this issue is solved.

Your understanding of TBTF (too big to fail) is wrong. When the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed it allowed banking/lending institutions to merge with investment firms. Thus, many of the accounts were investment related non-FDIC insurable accounts.
The FDIC paid only $9B back to depositors since the Great Recession of. 2008. The liability of AIG alone was $1.8 trillion. Your assumption that TBTF resulted from a lack of FDIC funds is erroneous.

There are two reasons which I'm sure have been posted in the sub many times. But for your benefit I'll ELI5 it here:
1. Fiat currencies naturally depreciate over time due to inflation. This is by design. This ensures that the velocity of money does not stagnate. A lack of monetary velocity leads to a hoarding effect where Bitcoin can't be used as a currency but is instead used only as an asset that stores value. However, there is no intrinsic value to Bitcoin, and is not backed by any central institution. This means that Bitcoin's value will always be more volatile than traditional fiat currencies because its money supply is constrained. 
2. As less and less bitcoins are uncovered by minors transaction fees will become more and more expensive. In fact, this seems Bitcoin was designed with this intent. This would allow miners to continue to receive BTC for their service. However, as transaction fees increase the benefit of having payment verifications completed on a peer to peer network decreases. Initially, bitcoiners thought the savings of transaction fees would and the "ease" of using a digital currency would help emerging markets. However, at its peak BTC's transaction fees became 46¢ which is already higher than the [37¢ transaction fee by M-Pesa](

I've already explained it but you chose to remain ignorant. Velocity of currency does not take market cap into consideration. It is merely the speed at which a good is sold. As I already cited the vast majority of bitcoins have never been used, and I already stated that the chiemgauer had a much higher velocity than BTC. In fact, all 3 currencies I listed did as they were designed for use - not the storage of assets.

Really? Do you live in a bubble? The vast majority of people have never even heard of Bitcoin, nevermind understand what it is or how it works. Most people that are familiar with BTC only really know that it was the primary currency to buy illicit goods and services, and that it's incredibly volatile. 
For this to change we need to create a thriving marketplace, but to create a thriving marketplace we need to stabilize the value of BTC comparative to other currencies. We cannot do this when most of the coins are being hoarded as investment and are not used enough. We need to choose either to make a BTC a digital currency that makes a few people rich every once a while, but that eventually will die off OR we need to choose to focus on making BTC a real currency that is used and not just hoarded.

This is pure economics 101. Hoarding currencies is a common way to start a deflationary trend, dissuade people from actually utilizing the currency, changing its perception from something valuable into something that has no value whatsoever. 
I'll explain this is an analogy. You are in middle school. Instead of money students trade pudding snacks for things they want. If a student wants a pen, or a calculator a student would use pudding snacks as a form of alternate currency. The problem here is that every student is given pudding snacks everyday. So, they save them but there isn't much to buy. After a whole year everybody has a ton of pudding snacks stored up in their lockers, but because everyone has them no one is willing to accept it as a form of payment because they already have too much and they only have a limited amount of things they can purchase. 
Once the pudding snacks have no value the pudding snacks are essentially worthless. This is a pretty simple economic concept.

Essentially you're borrowing the structure of how virtually every fiat currency on Earth is controlled. But this would prevent Bitcoin from being a investment opportunity. It would make Bitcoin an actual currency. That's something investors don't want, which is the problem with Bitcoin. 
Until these changes happen Bitcoin will always be a get rich scheme for investors and nothing more.

But then it's no different from keeping dollars in a bank account. The point of BTC is that you can directly make peer to peer transactions without paying 3rd party fees - again you are removing the advantages for using BTC in the first place. 
It's like trying to find an alternative mode of transportation, and then realizing that if you put tires on a boat you could drive it around instead of just driving the car that was already built to complete the task more efficiently. 
We shouldn't remove the advantages of using BTC simply to make it more palatable because otherwise it serves no purpose except for being a novelty technology for the average consumer.

That's simply not how it works. Inflating the money supply only devalues currency when the velocity of money is stagnant, or decreases. Now, if you want to talk about monetary policy and some of the mistakes the Fed has made, I'm more than willing to have that debate - but your understanding of how the FDIC ensures depositors is fundamentally flawed. 
The FDIC does not ask the Fed to ask the Treasury to print money. The FDIC requires banks to provide a certain percentage of their assets in their fund to cover any potential loses. When a bank is insolvent the FDIC will pay up to $250k per depositor (per person not per account).

There are plenty of other alternative currencies where volatility is not nearly as big of an issue. This belief that bitcoin is so uniquely different from the hundreds of other alternative currencies is not based on fact - just ideology. 


It's absolutely not. Simply having more vendors doesn't magically solve the problem if the majority of bitcoins aren't actively being used/traded. Just because so far Bitcoin has been resilient after three major market collapses does not mean that it will continue to do so in the future.

The number of users that use an exchange vs. use their wallet is irrelevant. The AMOUNT of bitcoin in exchanges is what matters. [Half of all bitcoin's market cap is owned by less than .5% of all bitcoin users]( thus if a tiny fraction of users choose an exchange and it collapses it could kill the value of all bitcoins on the market. 


That's the worst attempt at spinning information I've seen in a while. 


How does the number of vendors indicate that there are more than 170k unique bitcoin users? That's like saying there are 5 hair salons in the area so I can estimate there are 500 women in the neighborhood. It's a ridiculous correlation based on an even more ridiculous assumption.

Exactly. It's a digital currency. It's unregulated. So "where" is the jurisdiction? What are the merits of the case? You can't sue your investment broker if the market tanks and you lose all your money. You must prove fraud, and then determine where the lawsuit would take place - and even if you win the lawsuit you'd have to then have another court decision to decide how to collect if Mt.Gox's assets aren't liquid. 
More importantly, how can you prove fraud? In regulated financial markets there are strict regulations. For example, in the US every bank must maintain records for 5 years. Mt. Gox could destroy all their records tomorrow. So what proof of fraud will you have? It's just circumstantial. They could say they were hacked, they could destroy all of their records, and all you would have is your word against theirs. 
When there are no rules to play fairly people will always find a way to play dirty. That's the problem with an unregulated market.

Yeah, it sucked. This was back when I used to be rich, and the place I'm talking about was amazing. Close to MSG. 2 bedrooms, a fireplace, a rooftop patio, close to 800 sq. ft inside, and another 200 sq. feet outside (mind you this is personal space - not communal). They wouldn't accept me because I was self-employed for under 3 years, and I didn't have audited financials. Instead I chose a place next to Times Square (big fucking mistake) a one bedroom 800+ sq. foot apt. It was nice. It was $300 a month more and NOTHING compared to the MSG apt, but nice hardwood floors, a useable kitchen, a decent bedroom and the building had was cool. It had a pool, a gym, a tanning roof, and accepted all my packages. It was just annoying after 6 months dealing with the walking traffic everyday. I wish I moved to the LES instead, but I didn't know how cool the area was until much later. 
Anyway, I still ended up paying close to $8,000 in broker fees for that one bedroom, and frankly I was lucky to get the place. Back then if you didn't meet their requirements they didn't even look at you. So the broker had to find me a place that would accept my application. Btw, I even offered to pay the rent completely upfront for a year - a one time payment, they all rejected the idea. It was illegal for them to accept it. That's why brokers are so friggin' expensive.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:59:08
No. There is no evidence suggesting fraud. Just speculation. Typically a regulatory body would have enough information to recommend criminal charges to a law enforcement body, but Bitcoin is unregulated so no regulatory agency has the information to make an informed decision.

It depends on the organization. There is no way I can protect myself better than a multibillion dollar organization that prides itself on security. The biggest benefit to using Bitcoin is the cheap transaction fee. The fact that you can store private keys yourself is a hinderance towards mass adoption. It's a bug. Not a feature. 
One of the very first reasons to put your money in a bank was to protect large cash amounts that were in homes and businesses from thieves. By utilizing a private key that you are responsible for protecting you are simply using the digital equivalent of a personal army to protect your money. The requirement to be always vigilant is not what the masses want. Unless this changes BTC will always be "that nerdy thing that made people lose a ton of money all the time" in the mindset of most people.

Most definitely. It wasn't even fiat currency back then. So there was always obvious inherit value to it. There was never a "bottom out" situation like we've seen with Bitcoin. 
[The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.](
The dollar in 1797 was incredibly more stable than bitcoin is today. Not only is bitcoin a fiat currency (which in itself isn't a bad thing) but it also has 0 backing from any credible institutions. Your faith in the value of your BTC is based on your affinity for the community as well as your biased opinion as an investor. It is not backed by any central authority like the USD was in 1797. This the value of Bitcoin depends in your perceived value, whereas in 1797 since the USD was based on previous metals it's value could easily be calculated. 


[Absolutely]( Researchers found that 64% of bitcoins are in accounts that have never been used. This is contrary to currencies like the German Chiemgauer that purposefully deflate the value of older currency to incentivize the purchase of goods as opposed to Bitcoin where coins are just hoarded. I suggest you read the sourced articles.

our analogy simply doesn't pass the smell test. Credit Card numbers do not typically hold someone's wealth. Your savings are in tact even when your card is stolen. Also, when Target was hacked (not VISA) one of the best parts of a centrally regulated payment system was shown. VISA nor Target could hold any customers liable for any fraudulent purchases. The law simply does not allow credit card companies to hold individuals liable for more than $50. 
That's why getting your credit card stolen isn't that bad. As long as you can show that they are fraudulent you aren't responsible for those charges. No wealth, currency, or commodity was or can be stolen. If someone steals your private key and withdraws your money - what is your recourse? You have none. The two situations are not analogous in the slightest.

This is what we will need to see mainstream use. We need some sort of centralized protection. We can't have banks taking deposits and running away. The FDIC insures people up to $250k.

That is good for the short term, but as miners get less and less Bitcoins the market is going to have to replace those earnings with transaction fees to keep the network growing and verify transactions quickly.

I give Bitcoin and other 2 years. Definitely, not 10. By then there will be a new digital currency that learns from Bitcoin's mistakes. In fact, that's pretty much the reason that I subscribed. To witness the mistakes. 
The future **is digital currency**, but it is *not* Bitcoin. Are you familiar with W3C? I'm a web developer so in intimately familiar with the workings of it. That will be the open group that creates standards. Like a browser if you are an exchange you don't have to participate but you also don't have any of the protections and most non-speculative consumers are going gravitate towards institutions that follow their policies. 
Exchanges, software, monetary/currency standards and policies will regulated by this 
board that is similar to the [World Wide Consortium]( This group will be tasked with creating standards (like the SEC). They will work with an organization(s) that will mimic what the FDIC does. Each exchange will essentially be a bank (and a lending institution), and be required to report on their accounting and fractional reserve quantities - all made publicly available. 
We won't have the limitations of money supply. Those mistakes will be corrected, but most of all this Board will be able to correct market forces that lead to wild speculation. In essence this Board will be similar to the Federal Reserve. 
That's how digital currency is going to work. The same protections we have how, just scalable so not any one corporation or country can manipulate it - and we won't have this wasteful investor bonanza and actually create monetary policies that accelerate the velocity of the currency instead if market forces that create bubbles that just burst every so often. 
That's the future. We broke up with currency for a few years. Bitcoin was our rebound chick. 
Too many people think it will survive as it exists today. It'll exist, but it will be with a marketcap that is even less relevant than it is now.

Don't forget that [Coinlab is already suing Mt. Gox for $75 million]( which is way more money than they generate so even in the best case scenario if there was a "win" for all of the individual investors in a class action suit, Coinlab would be the largest creditor (if they win) and everyone else would get peanuts. 
And that's assuming if Japan's civil litigation is similar to the US, which it is not. Unlike the US Japan does NOT have an extensive discovery process, which means the plaintiff must have the information on hand to prove fraud exists, and can not rely on information from the defendant. Also, in Japan there is no such thing as punitive damages which how civil suits in the US get so lucrative. 
The Coinlab case is a mere breach of contract. There is very little fact funding necessary. Proving fraud is difficult in the US, and without forensic accountants to pour over their data it will be virtually impossible in Japan.

There are basic economic principles that show why collectively this does not happen. 
If bitcoin owners believe the value of their bitcoins will be higher in the future and they want to buy a good or service, are they more likely to use a traditional currency (like USD) that actually loses value every year (due to inflation and the natural growth in GDP) or Bitcoins that will potentially be of much greater value in the future? 
Why would investors essentially lose profitability to buy a product in bitcoins that can increase in value when dollars (for example) will lose value? They are disincentivized to spend their bitcoins due to speculation, [and this is essentially what is happening]( 
This is why trying to use Bitcoins as both a currency and a commodity (or a way to store assets) won't ever be stable and thus will never be a true currency unless this problem is solved.

Austrian economics is based off psychology and not on math or science. It's completely and utterly debunked by every industrialized nation in the world. 


That's not only false, it's a retarded statement. There is an intrinsic value in lots of things. Say I have a sandwich. That has an intrinsic value because I can eat it. I can also sell it for money. Or I can barter it for another good or service. It has value that is not dependent on other forms of currency or a value. This is one of the basics of economics. Please learn it. 


That was an example. Even at $1000 which lasted much longer, the transaction fee was higher than what is already possible in emerging markets. Even still one day would make users of Bitcoin lose money as opposed to using alternate methods like M-Pesa.

The Central Bank of Russia is not the entity that declared Bitcoin *illegal*. It was the Prosecutor's General Office. Asking the Central Bank if Bitcoin is *illegal* is like asking Congress if they can approve your social security application.   
Additionally, the Prosecutor's General Office did not necessary call Bitcoin *illegal*, it said that if you do use it you will be investigated in order to ensure that you are not involved in any of the illicit activities that have been associated with Bitcoin. 
TL; DR: So, it's not illegal but if you use it in Russia you will be treated like a criminal.

There is no coffin to shut. You are probably ignorant to the fact that there has been an academic dispute since 2008 regarding speculation how increases price volatility. Unfortunately, you chose to believe (mostly) sources that lack any credibility even choosing cite sources that listed their findings as "very preliminary". 
It also seems you don't understand what speculation actually does to a commodity. 
[Price volatility is exacerbated by the tendency of market actors to follow momentum strategies, where price rises encourage more buying, and falls encourage selling; and third, prices are forced away from ‘fair value’ levels for extended periods](
Here are plenty of studies and expert opinions that argue that speculation is the reason for volatility in certain commodities:
[U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission](
Additionally, [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has for the first time revealed that almost 95 per cent of US crude oil futures volume is generated by day trading or betting on arcane price relationships, suggesting long-term bets on whether prices will rise or fall have little effect on energy price volatility.](
And just for shits and giggles this is from Steve Forbes, himself (not some random contributor):

In NYC it's not just about time. Many luxury apartments won't even deal with you if you are not represented by a broker because of the very strict requirements needed to be approved. Brokers pre-approve you based on the management company's requirements. 
For example, the apartment I wanted was run by a management company that required a minimum salary of $300,000 for an apartment that was $4,000 a month. If you are self-employed under 3 years some may require audited financials. None of the management companies want to waste their time showing the places to unqualified people. This is why brokers are important in New York. Unfortunately, they are fucking expensive. 
Nonetheless, this very reputable firm will only help the perception of Bitcoin by showing that high value legal transactions are commonplace, and BTC isn't only meant to pay for illicit goods &amp; services.

Now you are putting your faith in one central organization which is one of the things BTC was created to avoid.

If you are going to put your trust in BitPay what's the point of using a decentralized currency like Bitcoin? Might was well use the USD or Euro. 


Bitcoin was largely allowed to thrive without the involvement of government or other regulatory bodies. We've seen what happens when countries like Thailand &amp; China limit BTC's use. As it grows it will be regulated - at the very least enough so consumers pay taxes in their BTC wealth. You can not judge BTC history without government intervention when the future clearly shows that BTC will not be free from government regulation forever.

That's absolutely and completely false. Do you not keep up with the news? [The collapse of Mt. Gox decreased the market value of bitcoins by 10%.](
You continue to make assumptions that are patently false, yet claim that users that use exchanges are ignorant and are unable to perform basic research when the same could be said about yourself. I apologize if that sounds like a personal attack - it's not. I'm merely making a point. 


Sigh. This is simply another assumption based on irrelevant data. There is a lot of room to grow in the African grey parrot market. Its in high demand but with few suppliers. That doesn't "supports the idea that it might be a good idea to get in now"


Much of it was speculation based on downloads of software. That doesn't mean anyone that downloads a wallet actually uses it, and it doesn't account for people that have downloaded software multiple times for different computers. I, like other users in the beginning, created multiple wallets and have peanuts in there from sporadic mining attempts. If you look at the [Bitcoin Distribution by Address at Block 280,000]( you'd see that 95% have dust (less than  0.001 BTC). 


**Interest** in BTC has exploded, however that doesn't mean that the amount of users that have obtained bitcoin as increased dramatically. While 170k users maybe a bit on the conservative side the numbers and methods that were cited in the thread you linked is nothing more than pure speculation.  People were using the number of active forum members to determine the number of bitcoin users - that's incredibly, well...stupid.

Sorry, forgot to answer your second question. The Federal Reserve is a semi-public and semi-private organization. Though the President appoints the seven members of the board, and are confirmed by the senate they operate more or less like a private organization. There are issues related to their transparency, and by no means are a perfect organization  but the alternative (to get rid of them) would be disastrous. The "Federal" in the Federal Reserve was put their to build trust. However, it's status being a semi-private/semi-government controlled is somewhat similar to that of the Post Office.

You are wrong on both counts. Unfortunately you live in a pro-bitcoin bubble and have a poor understanding of economics. 
There is absolutely no way to make the sporadic drops in currency devaluation analogous to what we've seen with Bitcoin. It is common for BTC to fluctuate in value by 10% in 24 hours, and it is considered a common occurrence. If you don't understand how that is perceived to be volatile by pretty much every economist in the world, then I nor anyone else will be able to explain it to you. 


You are judging BTC on mere market cap, yet there are so many other factors to determine what makes alternate currency successful. One of the most important is the [velocity of money]( This is where Bitcoin fails miserably. For most people involved in BTC, owning Bitcoins is no different from holding on to a stamp collection. They'll never actual use any of the stamps, but they hope one day it'll be worth a ton of money. This is why some countries have ruled Bitcoin to be [speculative investment]( but is not yet currency.

A 100% success rate would imply that older devices were successfully broken into as well. You don't need to use the latest APIs to get access to these features.

The problem with Bitcoin is that it continues to be used merely as an investment strategy instead of an real alternative to current currencies. In order for a currency to thrive a marketplace needs to be created. To develop a marketplace that accepts Bitcoin the currency needs some stability, but you can't have stability when the [majority of the currency holders]( simply hoard it. 
Because the value increases so rapidly individuals don't want to get rid of their coins, thus products &amp; services aren't purchased and therefore vendors don't see the need to support it - especially when the volatility of bitcoins creates an unnecessary economic risk as opposed to other currencies. 
When products &amp; services can't be bought with a currency it loses its perceived value and thus spectators initiate a sell off which is what happened in 2011. 


Yes , there were security issues as well but those are resolvable. The main problem with bitcoins has yet to be solved. A decision has to be made. Will bitcoins be a real alternative to currency? Or will it merely be a niche investment opportunity that helps a few people become rich and then dies out.

Frankly, I don't think that my analogy is that far off. In your analogy you would be picking up the QR code and handing it back to him immediately. In this case money was actually stolen (and yes I understand the intent was to return it). 
What's the solution? Contacting Bloomberg via their social networks or via phone and alert them of the situation and allow them to resolve it. Again, my reasoning for this is public perception. Even if it was maliciously stolen by someone else Bloomberg would have reported that other people in the BTC community tried to alert them of the error. 
The other issue is the new damn vague cybersecurity laws. Obviously, the guy wasn't a dick and appreciated what the BTC community was trying to do, but if he wasn't he could have called up the FBI. I know it sounds like I'm going off the deep end, but it's already happened. The mere logging into an account EVEN if you know the credentials is now considered "hacking" according to the FBI. The risk of that happening was far too great &amp; and would pose even more of a perception problem. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, but I really don't think I am. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:05:49
I think the fear isn't just because it dropped in value so significantly, but the reason it happened. 
Because China cracked down on the currency the fear is that other countries will do it to. Typically, when this happens investors believe that there will be less and less ways that they will be able to use their stored currency. This makes them loose faith in the currency and starts a self-off that ends in a death spiral.  
That's the real fear. In the US [banks have started informing users to stop sending money to Coinbase and others]( because they are not conducting themselves legally. 
In the US these organizations have to get licensed in each and every state they want to do business in (well...47 of them), and under federal law they have to maintain due diligence on their customers, assign a compliance officer, and all sorts of nonsense. Most do not. In fact, only 35 BTC companies are compliant with US law. 
Many fear a federal crackdown is eminent because of the willingness shown to purposefully avoid US laws, licenses and regulation.
