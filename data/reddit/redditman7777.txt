That's a big mess from what I hear. You will need to contact each exchange and work with them . This is what MY research and understanding is...
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:01:13
I did find a Google way to do it but it didn't work at all...i think Google is behind in what it's saying and what the software actually does
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:21:00
does the price go up again then? or do they try to control/regulate it
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:22:28
Thats ok mate you will still do well in times to come. I am sure you can start making some good money soon. I read a post from someone who lost his brother to the Bitcoin (he lost 6000 BTC in a hack and he committed suicide)... you only lost one BTC that too not completely!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:32
I don't have a good feeling about this.. this time
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:23:43
now plz get a reverse tattoo of the password between your ass cheeks and plz buy a small vanity mirror.

It's been USD $13189 in the Aussie exchanges for a few hours now already!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:36:25
wow this is great and it takes strong will and character to do what you are doing. Its my aim too to somehow make multi millions but then donate most of it. Good work
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:41:10
Same happened to me!!! Good luck.

26K in Australia
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:22:36
Sorry but can someone ELI5 this to me please? I still don't get if he means the price drops considerably or he means nothing to worry with due to the Futures thing coming into effect on 10th?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:44:46


do your own research
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:41:37
Nearly USD 17000 NOW on Aussie exchanges. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:09:48
Does that mean they would manipulate the market to get the price of btc down to around 8k?
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:49:06
lol nice one... but probably culturally insensitive..coz that would mean equating Nakamoto to a puppy dog. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:00:18
well I guess then I will go by this username for a VERY long time to come!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:09:45
Hodl then I suppose
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:56:04
Oops what have I downloaded today on my iPhone it says Mycelium !!! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:36:19
But how much dip are we expecting? With the skyrocketing increase I think the dip would be nothing compared to todays prices?
Lets say it dips by 1000-1500, the price would have reached 10k easily by then! So the dip would bring back the prices to 8.5 K which it stands today
(All prices Aussie $$)  
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:00:36
lol thanks.. I thought I had downloaded a fake app or something!! 
Q. Can you connect Ledger Nano S to Mycelium on iOS?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:41:51
but then, how would I receive the coins from the app?
I m sorry I m very new
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:02:41
So when is this happening? Roughly
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:38:55
How does the breadwallet compare to Mycelium? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:57:42
yeah cant find any link for model T. Unless of course they put a link and pre order link after 3 hours
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:05:35
thank you for explaining that mate. Cheers.
So I guess I should get the ledger asap then
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:58:56
Yeah I am thinking the same.. so even if it hits 10k (Aussie) it should fall back to 8.5ish
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:51:51
Amen Lord Ryan Amen
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:34:24
OK thanks so that means the ledger needs to be connected to the internet to receive the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:39:23
Do you know which website to do to?
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:33:40
I feel ya brother!
