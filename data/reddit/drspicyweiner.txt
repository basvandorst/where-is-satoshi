Oops, there is. But it requires a malleability fix (which segwit provides)

Let's say I open a channel with Bob, both of us commiting 1 BTC. I then send him 0.5 BTC through the channel. Leaving 0.5 BTC on my side, and 1.5 BTC on his.
We never send BTC between us again, but our channel is used two route 0.5 BTC in the other direction between Alice and Rose, leaving both of us with 1 BTC in the channel. Bob hasn't lost money as his channel with Alice has increased by 0.5 BTC, as well as I not having gained money, as my channel with Rose has lost value.
If I then close the channel with Bob my initial payment has disappeared.

What's KYC?

Considering that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, the value will have to increase a lot still, to sustain the world's economy (if we assume all tx done on-chain)

Yes, let's solve Bitcoins scaling problems by letting 8 times as many transactions being confirmed each 1/6 of an hour. Oh wait, that can't replace the 25000 people who use Visa per second. I sure hope there was an 2nd layer solution which allowed for this kind of scalling

First of all, 1TB= 1000000MB (1048576 actually, but who cares)
To my understanding channels are not necessarily 1-to-1. Imagine a store having a sale and opening a channel. Many people can then buy things sending money to the store through the channel. During the sale some people buy more things at different times (thereby sending multiple tx through the channel). Other people would like a refund and the store returns the BTC through the channel. When the sale ends they close the channel and a single tx is written to the BTC blockchain, with multiple inputs (the consumers) and one output (the store). The people who bought more things have their purchases fused to one, and the ones who got a refund are erased (neglecting the abysmal fees).
As you can see this leads to an exponential increase in capacity as the LN lane could be whatever width, and only result in 1 (or 2, idk) tx on the blockchain.
BCash's solution of increasing block size only leads to a linear increase of bandwidth, while increasing the size of the blockchain on nodes.
So what he was saying is that BCash needs to increase their blocksize by 1000000x to equal the exponential increase LN brings.
This of course assumes that BCash doesn't implement LN as soon as it is out and stable.
Please correct me if I'm wrong

There isn't really 7 layers. It's just a way to divide the protocols in the internet stack sensibly.
I know how it works, all I'm trying to do is explain it to the less technical people, using a medium everybody can relate to.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:19:40
It does not have to be replaced, it can just be changed in a way where it is still compliant with the above layers.
I think you are reading too much into this. I'm not trying to suggest that Bitcoin should work exactly like the internet. All I'm trying to say is that you can vastly expand Bitcoins capabilities by building layers on top of it, instead of trying to change Bitcoin itself.

Yeah, I started by writing the title.
The post went in another direction than what i originally intended, so I should probably have changed the title.

Yes, but there are more than 7 of them.
TCP/IP is two protocols, one on top of the other, but together they constitute what is called the Transport layer.

Neither Picassos or Bitcoin are fungible

Neither. Store your private keys in a hardware wallet

My thoughts about Bitcoin reaching a stable price, is that it requires people to have a tangible understanding of what value it has.
Right now it is magic internet money which most people can't use to buy anything, which allows it to fluctuate so much, because it is only used as an investment asset.
However, when I can go down in the grocery store and use my lightning wallet to buy a liter of milk, the price will be a lot more stable. I know that 100 satoshis buys me a liter of milk, so I won't accept that it costs 1000 satoshis the next day.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:36:06
Have you actually looked at the fees lately? Transactions with 4-5 satoshis/byte gets confirmed on the next block
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:43:50
Your Visa uses the currency of your country, which is why you don't see that currency fluctuate a lot. You know 1 currency = 1 milk

When I can use 0.001 to buy an object I can see, I know 0.001 equals that object

Well, there is if you are actually interested in a global decentralized currency..
Of course Bitcoin is not needed, if you are fine with trusting the banks/Visa
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:36:38
The only reason you don't need to top off you Visa card, is because you job pays your salary to the account of which your visa card withdraws funds.
If BTC/lightning ever gets fully adopted, you would just receive your salary directly on your lightning wallet. No need to top it off.
