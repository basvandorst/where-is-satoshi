I'll sell my Lambo to buy bitcoin as much as possible if it reached that level. No regret.

This. Same goes to YouTube channels. You can see lots of view regularly but only a small fraction of them did leave comments.

Enlighten me. How do I get a loan from bitcoin when I needed them? I'm willing to mortgage my house if needed because I'm urgently needing 200k usd? If I have problem transferring my coin to another place or some dispute happened with my transaction with bitcoin, which customer support can I contact to resolve it? If I'm short on cash/bitcoin for food, what can help me temporarily to endure until my next paycheck except credit card?
There's a line between fiat and bitcoin. People just don't seem to get it, and the only valid line they can kept giving themselves is "bitcoin is currency of future! Bitcoin solved every problem that fiat can't! Bitcoin is better than fiat!". People nowadays really can be easily manipulated into wrong info and not thinking wisely just by watching some "white paper" or "youtube introduction to bitcoin"

And when that happened, it's going to weaken cryptocurrency's economy more. Imagine whole world including China people is trading btc-alt-ico but only non China people is pumping in the fiat into the system?

Binance is from China and recently moved their operation to Hong Kong. Currently 97% of their customer based is not China people

I actually can't understand the part where "people get sicked and tired by conventional financial system". They actually works great and have features that bitcoin don't  (bank do provides loan to credible people, cash in hand is backed by country financial institutions, credit card let you spend money and pay back later with higher limit for more credible users, widely accepted, and so many more features than bitcoin)
Admit it. 95% people invest in bitcoin is only hoping to get rich and don't really care about it's future, and in bitcoin money have to come from someone's pocket to another.

Eventually massive scale of buying and selling of cryptocurrency with a large groups of people still requires them to be able to transact fiat via a few mechanism which will allow government to monitor. No there's not gonna be much hope if their government says no and sent those that trades into jail.

It's useless if you have no way to convert your fiat into crypto.

I believe you have been heavily propaganda by your so called "information from Google". You can't answer any questions I asked you earlier. Dont misunderstood, I'm not a anti-bitcoin guy, personally I've made a fortune through bitcoin although lately it's down at 70% from my personal portfolio ATH yet I'm left with less than 10 and also just so you know, I'm a full time crypto trader raising my kid at home. I'm in just for the profits. I started back in 2013 April with only 80% volume on mtgox and 15% volume on btc-e.


To trust a 3rd party organized by a few people to managed your fund is worst than to trust the bank.
