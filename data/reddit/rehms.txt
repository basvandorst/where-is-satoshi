Dat selfie doe.... WHY, MAN! Why do you think that's a good pic? Get with some friends, go out one night, ask a stranger, "Hey, mind taking a mic of my friends and me?" then use that as your profile pic.

I wouldn't really try to trade the market, because it's too volatile. I think a lot of it is people who aren't necessarily trying to trade the market, but are scared it's going to crash at any moment and ready to pull out. I see the majority of BTC being traded between 0.1-1.0, but some as high as 200's. I would say the little numbers are people with only a few BTC that are worried it's going to crash and larger numbers might be people trying to trade the market.

no shit, a lot of computer science degrees and not enough finance / economics degrees.

What if I'm in the US? Is the only way to fund my account by using Western Union/money order?
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:25:41
I see. Well I live in a smaller city, so I have to imagine the options would be limited.

HAHAHAHA! Crash, baby! Crash! I saw this coming today when it was at $950. I bet it levels out around $840.

Hey, coinbase actually does seem like the easiest way to get verified. Do you have any opinion on their legitimacy and how quickly they verify?

Well, why have multiple companies that compete rather than just one that can do everything by itself? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:37:44
You created a company without the confidence that it WILL succeed and come to Reddit to get people's opinions?

Do people sit and try to trade the market via speculation?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:55:06
Yes ~~I did~~ they do.

I've been a commodity trader for only going on 7 months, and I have a small grasp on markets and the holistic system. I get advice from people who have years of experience and they all explain to me how multiple currencies is good. Look at how the Euro failed and Germany had to help keep it afloat, while the Pound was relatively untouched. Multiple currencies is good. But an "online" currency is something that I think is good, even if there is more than one to keep the others in check.

Honestly, all of the main ones. Obviously Mt.Gox, cashtocoin, coinmama, btc-e. I know what the issue is, I'm in the US. There is no way to fund my account online, the only way is going to be a money order. My brother did the money order thing and is STILL waiting a week later to get verified.

Can you use the bank account info is you are in America? This would be the first site that "coming soon" isn't attached to the bank account info way.
