Andreas, thank you for doing this and thanks for being the one that along with me (being converted) converts other people into true "believers"...even though i don't really like to use that word in this context.
I am one of the new guys.
I came for the quick buck and bought in at 999usd.
Didn't really understand anything about the protocol.
I kept buying more so i'm not that in the red now...but it doesn't really matter.
Slowly, seeing your enthusiasm and learning more and more about the protocol, also because of you, i had the same eureka moment when you start seeing the underlaying consensus achieving network and the almost endless possibilities in everyday life.
It's people like you that give newcomers the chance to be more than just the people who panic sell and won't be back for a long time.
Keep on doing what you do...

Ow...one more idea...before giving him all that money to buy new trains with :) Can you just water board him for 3 minutes...just in case he in fact IS satoshi?

we did cross the bear trend line though...not that it matters much but it is good timing.On the trend i drew on bitcoinwisdom it actually missed only by an hour or so. Eerie.
