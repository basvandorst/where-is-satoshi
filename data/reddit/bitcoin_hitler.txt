The only thing useful the ETF does is reduce the risk that Mark Karpeles steals all your coins off some other untrusted exchange. They (the winkledinkle twins) are saying, "We hold the coins, and here are some notes that represent those coins. Trust us, we're not going to run off with them". For a lot of people, that feels safer than trusting their cash/coins with some exchange without much public clout.

So what? Hash rate doesn't really matter because difficulty just adjusts. As it currently sits, the entire network can be supported with 1% of the current hash power if difficulty was adjusted downward to reflect that.
The fact that all these machines are turned on not really adding to the network is a pretty serious issue. It's inefficient and wasteful.

We "invest" in them in a very short term fashion. Most people work for a living. They get paid cash and then can decide to do one of three things with that cash. They can either save it for some future expense, spend it immediately on current expenses, or use it to purchase investments that will in the long run produce a return.
There is a fourth thing you can do, which is to treat that cash as an investment itself. But that is a guaranteed losing proposition, so only idiots hold on to massive amounts of cash.

Sounds to me like you dislike the overwhelming truth: that bitcoin intself doesn't create any economic value, and that the companies started around it haven't shown a track record for creating value either.
Mt. Gox. Neo &amp; Bee. Butterfly labs. Silk Road. Cex.io. There are many more. Those were just the few that came to mind instantly when I glanced a thought for it.
All of these companies/marketplaces were or still are big in the bitcoin space. And yet all of them have been rife with scamming, stealing, and/or dealings of an incredibly dubious nature. You can stick your fingers in your ear and pretend that the majority of mainstream bitcoin "companies" aren't actually scams, get rich quick schemes, or otherwise legitimate business; however, that doesn't change the reality that you (and many others like you) will soon need to swallow and accept.

Except this cannot happen without development work to fix the myriad flaws with bitcoin is a protocol. And we've seen in 6 years that there is almost none of that. The fact that it can't handle more than 3 transactions per second, the fact that payments are irreversible, the fact that there is no way to apply monetary controls based on the state of the economy, the fact that it is designed to be deflationary (a poor quality for money to have), the fact that there is no way to know how many coins are in circulation and how many have been lost forever, the fact that an internet connected device is required to do a transaction, the fact that confirmation times take forever, I can seriously go on and on and on about this. All of these things (and more) need to be fixed before bitcoin can be useful.

Currencies are meant to be spent. If you're sitting on 50% or more of your net worth in currency of any form then you're either an idiot or extremely old and need that many to pay for your expenses as a retiree.
Currencies are never meant to be an investment vehicle. NEVER. The reason why of course is that over time they slowly lose their value. That doesn't mean though that cash has no utility. You should want to keep a small amount of your net worth in cash to pay for expenses and to buy cheap investments.
However, the bulk of your worth should be in investments producing a return. Things like ownership in companies, real estate, etc.
Most people here get paid in currency. But only a fool would treat such a thing as an investment.
Bitcoin people seem to think that money (which is used to transact with) should also be an investment. I say 'no' to that. Keep only as much cash as you need for the immediate and near term future. Beyond that, invest in assets that produce some output gain.

The answer to your question: sell half your bitcoins for real money and hold that. If your Bitcoin goes up in value then steadily sell it as a rebalancing measure to get to your 50/50 mix asset allocation. If your Bitcoin goes down in value do the opposite and buy to keep the ratio the same.
Hedging is something that individual investors rarely have a need to do (aside from maybe tax considerations). You would end up losing money because in a short position you have to pay interest on the Bitcoin you're borrowing to short. Yes, you'd get the same effect as if you just sold them for real money, but all along you'd also incur the interest cost so your position would steadily lose value.

Maybe if more people choose to buy child porn with Bitcoin will such a high price be justified. All other price action right now is just speculators being idiots.

Not like a stock at all. Because stock represents ownership of a company which is made up of assets (intellectual property, human capital [labor], land, etc) that is capable of producing value in the form of products and services. Bitcoin doesn't have any such thing backing it, so it wouldn't make sense to make an analogy to a stock.
The next best thing you could make an analogy for is gold or some other non-consumable commodity that has minor to little use in industry.

Stocks are ownership in companies that actually produce value by creating goods and services. That gives them inherent value. By contrast, Bitcoin itself creates no such products or services so it has no intrinsic value. It's like gold but even worse since it isn't even backed by a physical material. On top of this, it isn't scarce because infinite cryptocurrencies can be created to take its place.

Once you decide that you have the authority to kill someone because they embarrassed you, or because they're going to take away your lucrative illegal livelihood, that's it for you as far as our society is concerned.

Paying for a stock exactly what it is worth is still a winning proposition since it represents all future earnings of the company adjusted to compensate for the time value of money and risk that the expected return doesn't match the price paid. Companies produce products and services which allow them to generate cash flow and increase the value of the company. Investing is not simply assuming that a greater fool will pay more in the future; it is purchasing a piece of a company that produces a return on investment by creating things that are desired by human beings. That is the essence of our economy, and why investing is not the same as speculating.

TA is like cold reading psychic prophecies. You have a bunch of predictions made by idiots that cannot understand that price action isn't determined primarily by collective psychology of traders, but by the individual driving forces of people acting in their own selfish interests. They can just throw predictions out all day based on whatever lines they decided to fit the data. Whenever new data comes out that doesn't match their predictions, they draw a new line fitting to the previous data plus the new data, and try again. When they're right, they gloat, and when they're wrong, they just try again and everyone forgets their failed prediction.

Thats for each person to decide based on the risk involved. Some people would say yes for certain customers, and default to no for everyone else. Others would say no in every case.
Point is, if there is no electricity, you cannot barter with bitcoins if you have zero trust for the counterparty. Period. There is no way to process the transactions off the blockchain and be certain that the transfer took place after reconnecting to the network. There is no cryptographic proof that the transfer actually took place because it hasn't been placed into a block.

Ironic you say this, since there is solid evidence that he introduced more violence by paying large sums of money to have people he didn't like assassinated.


That's not the precedent to be set. You see, this is different from a lot of other cases because he was collecting a fraction of the proceeds of illegal drug sales. This isn't like file sharing or DMCA violations. He was profiting from illegal drug trade. Which, in the opinion of the majority, is a crime that should be punished heavily. This type of activity creates a very real cost to society that we are simply unwilling to pay for. That's why this idiot is going to jail permanently so that he cannot do this again in the future.

Not like that at all because in this case DPR knowingly took money off transactions that were clearly trade of illegal drugs. This isn't like he was running a beanie baby or Pokemon cards exchange and then happened to find out that one of the sellers is actually selling meth. That would be different.
In this case, it's pretty easy to prove that he knowingly skimmed profit off of illegal drug trades. And for that he's going to pay very dearly with his life as he rots away in federal prison with no chance at a normal life (as he rightly deserves). I have no compassion for idiots like this.

Troll is just what the majority of people here call users that point out the problems with bitcoin needing fixed. This currency had awesome potential. It really did. The main issue is that the community thinks that bitcoin is absolutely perfect and that nothing should change. Not the mining reward, not proof of work, not the hard cap on coins; nothing. Treating this thing like it was a gift given from God has pretty much ruined any chance it had to make it to the big time.

Self regulation doesn't happen when the reward for being unregulated (for the people that are in charge by owning large exchanges) is extremely high, as it is right now. The temptation to capitalize on the ability to frontrun all customer's orders is way too difficult to resist for people that know they're not going to face any repercussions for doing so.
Bitcoin community can agree to not do business with such exchanges, but because there is no transparency there really is no way to truly know if the exchange you're dealing with is not doing those things. Its one of those things when you just take their word.
