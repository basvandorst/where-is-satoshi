In the translation I think they mean intimately connected... yeah, who wouldn't have sex with money?

Thank you, I was just going to look at the exchanges websites directly - this is much nicer.

Basically they're going to try and put in identity requirements, prevent bitcoin insurance, and they are making a warning to individuals wanting to invest.
Also, google translate is funny sometimes; intimately connected =/= sex, but whatever...

Any rally is a bulltrap - whales or no.
Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered, and whales get harvested for oil.
The correction is healthy - this is Gresham's law. You guys wanted a currency, well guess what? Currencies flow - this is necessary. Personally I'll enter the market when I see the dead-cat bounce curve beginning to take shape. A lower price is good in the long term - it was over-heated and everybody knew it. Move aside and let the new adopters in at discount prices ;)

You *want* trading partners. I know how Gresham's Law works, but I, personally, would not be pleased at such a development.
The point of trade is, largely, to get comparative advantage. A low-friction currency is good - but you want currency to be exchangeable even with people you might not agree with 100%.
This comment makes me sad and want to facepalm.

This is froth - it'll go as low as the smart money wants it to go.
This pump and dump is older than the beartrap in making - so go back to the mean and subtract the area above the curve.
I'm optimistic that it'll be 650 to bounce - but realistically it could go lower... much lower.
I'm excited. I want in, but I'm not going for a swim until the sharks get out of the pool.

I saw the parabola, I think this is the bulltrap before the correction. I wish I could have shorted at 1240$/BTC, since this was obvious (I already posted on this a few days ago).
I'm actually excited to buy after the correction - in 6 months there will be another bubble, and I'd like to go long for six months and sell when it gets too far above the mean.
I missed the beartrap a few weeks ago... I would expect a rally before a larger sell-off, before the dead-cat bounce and stabilization.
This isn't my first rodeo - this is a common pattern.
The MtGox exchange is dipping under 1000 at this very moment.
I'll buy at 650, depending on volatility and the dead-cat bounce-curve.

Before the tumble cycle:
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:42:53
Bull*trap*. Let the smart money do what it's going to do. It's not even cyber monday - this volatility is a prelude, trust me, if you've got BTC, stay on the sidelines for a couple days, then buy back in when you have more information (this is a very common pattern and a correction is about to occur - just wait for monday and the people in offices to feel the fear...).
If you like BTC, then you'll still like it in a week - why not let the smart money subsidize your holiday? This was a pump and dump, and bitcoin can be very frothy due to its nature.
An anonymous algorithmic pump is worth paying 1% to MtGox and BTC-e for the price the smart money earned this month.
Don't be an emotional investor - be very rational right now.

Yes, it also comes at ~5pm Hong Kong time. The PBoC's statement is basically telling institutions there are some regulations that pertain to bitcoin, through their ""PRC Telecommunications Regulations" and "Internet Information Services"" and ""the PRC Anti-Money Laundering Law"" ,or "《中华人民共和国电信条例》和《互联网信息服务管理办法》" "中华人民共和国反洗钱法"
...whatever that means...

As of this moment there are 12 users of that subreddit...

The problem isn't that the Chinese people are allowed to buy it; the problem is that insurance, exchanges, innovative businesses aren't allowed to set prices in bitcoin, and that they are going require identification (like what happened with Mt. Gox). China might be becoming a more free society, but they are far from falling for another 100 flowers trick.
The PBoC/central bank saying they'll use anti-laundering laws to regulate bitcoin is... not, in my mind, a good thing... It makes sense that BTCchina saw a sell off; the Chinese people are like anyone - they don't want to be persecuted. If the government says "no" or, "we'll be watching you", then you just bide your time and don't be one of the 100 flowers.
You can't expect the Chinese to put their lives/livelihoods at risk for a trading algorithm. They sold 20+% and they had 34% market share. The USD has 57% market share, and it's selling around 20% off the 12 hour average.
If you want to do arbitrage, then by all means; you might make a lot of money (do a personal monetary fund), but I wouldn't harshly judge others for doing what they think is in their own best interests.

Don't buy the bulltrap, for the love of your wallet - let the market do what the market is going to do. This pattern is old as trade and economics.
Wait for the pre-dead-cat bounce to buy, or at least after the correction.
It's not even cyber monday - there's a lot that's has yet to happen. Ride the wave and don't invest emotionally - buy low sell high. And if you want to sell at 400, then maybe we can talk, but you'd have to pay me to buy at this particular moment. Even 950 (3:07pm EST) is overheated.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:28:06
Arbitrage - make money selling the shovels; a 31% decline in China vs. a 14% decline in USD. I wish I owned some fast computers in Alaska right about now...
**edit** I think the node is in Seattle, from what I can see off of blockchain info. 
**edit2** it looks like the prices are closer to matching now... there must have been a lot of dollars traveling to China just now. Watching the blockchain is kind of fun...
**edit3** I don't know why this is getting down voted - I'm merely suggesting that I would wish to earn fees off of the transpacific trade... also, it's a statement of fact that sleeping westerners are subsidizing the average Chinese investor's exit - in that; the limit orders that were outstanding have now been satisfied. Some money changed hands - why the negativity? I think the Chinese investors/early adopters deserve a kind price-floor from sleeping Americans. Also, if you snooze - you lose.
**edit4** since bitconity is slow - I'm watching  BTCchina at least has somewhat more fluid information. Don't get me wrong - I want into the market - I just want the price to correct (I think it's still overheated). I'm not anti-bitcoin; I'm just pro-market.
**edit5** there seems to be a negative feedback loop going on (25% total decline vs the 30% CNY shock vs CNY having less market cap than USD) - this will be a good buy tomorrow around noon tomorrow in NYC, maybe later depending on volatility. Bitcoin believers should be happy. If it's as good as you say - then you'll be very happy to buy more before the rebound (I think it will be a good buy after Gresham's law chases out the capital from "bad money" - i.e. investors who got into it during thanksgiving who knew nothing). *If volatility levels out around 600* I'll spend a few bucks - 600 seems like a good price-floor based on trendlines, but I could be wrong.

This is a healthy correction, move aside "spartans" - your currency is not currency unless it flows. The current of the market ebbs and flows.
The price needs to go down as part of Gresham's Law - it was over-heated and everyone knows it. Embrace the correction and remember that bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.

Bitcoin is very much agorist in concept and implementation.
I agree that this move is disingenuous (or "bullshit", as you say).
The idea of a ban on something offends agorist sensibilities.

Volume. The PBoC report came out.
It's a good thing people in the west are sleeping.

I think this is a bad idea. If people don't want to be "knights of the new", then they're free not to up/downvote and stick to "top", and not "new".
I don't see how this will be, in any way, helpful. But hey, I'm an anarchist, so what do I know about free speech?
Plus, who defines "emotional"?
Also, are price posts (and corollary information) something you want to ban?
Meh, do what you like. I have no... emotions... on the matter.
