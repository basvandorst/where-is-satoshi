I will check that out thank you.

Yup that's exactly whats happening to every one. There customer support is playing games with people and just trying to hold them off as long as possible to buy time.

Correct some coins but not Bitcoins. Also if you look around there are other crypto exchanges were you can find some coins cheaper and sell them for profit on cryptsy. But all of the sudden those wallets are under maintenance so you cant withdraw your coins after you sell them for profit, you cant make this stuff up!

At this level for Cryptsy yes!

Like I said before I had no problems previously this just became an issue over the past few weeks for me. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:04:01
Definitely not a lie

Convert to altcoins and transfer out.
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:35:57
Its not worth anything!!!

Not as long a greedy useless government has anything to say about it. Unless there getting paid from it some how they wont let it happen. They have to have there hands in everyone's pockets its the only way they sleep at night. But don't worry because if the to big to fail banks come up with one it will be alright.
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:19:31
Yup in the process...

Nope but the coins that I mined and traded into BTC are and now there is no way to get my BTC out.
@_date: 2015-12-11 13:14:28
Did not have them stored on Cryptsy only had BTC converted from mining alt coins. I didn't lose any BTC I converted to all altcoins and transferred out.

I previously had no problems that's why I'm surprised. I know they always had a sketchy reputation. But whats going on now is unprecedented. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:24:08
Yes that's exactly what I'm doing its working but alot of the other exchanges get much lower prices for the same coins. So I am actually loosing money getting my coins out and quite a bit might I add.
@_date: 2015-12-11 13:15:07
Very wise!
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:09:20
I really never had a problem until now so something is really wrong there.
