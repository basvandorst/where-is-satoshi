I’ve been waiting several hours with like $20 bucks in fees. Might as well get a snack while you wait in line.

I’m not gonna deny what you’re saying, but this year is far different from previous years. Institutional money. Millions of rookies who aren’t aware of its history (or its technology for that matter). I have no doubt that it’ll go back up, but the general public buy into anything they see on the news. I think it’ll get worse before it gets better, I just wanna be one to benefit from weak hands lol.

Maybe for Ver and his minions. To each their own. Some people only see dollar signs. I see a childish prick who won’t get a penny out of me. I can’t wait to sit back and watch the bch dump over a couple beers.

If you’re worried about price increasing, Coinbase locks in the price at the time of purchase. It’s more so going through the banks process for the delay.

Nah definitely not Christmas at this point. Just a domino effect on noobies jumping ship. This recent mass speculation made the price hike as quick as it can fall.

Yeah, a lot of noobs on here need some reassurance for everyone’s sake. These dips are always a nice lesson learned. This next beer is one for your good intentions, rather than the fud I’m seeing everywhere ��

If you're hodling then there's nothing to worry about. My biggest take out of this email was that I won't be able to buy more coin until furthest notice starting at 2am, haha. In the unlikely chance that the fork still occurs, they will credit us with the forked coins, but will not let us buy/sell until they say it's deemed safe. Seeing as we're currently sitting at an ATH, I don't see this being much of an issue over the next couple days unless you plan on selling. 
Hodling has never been so easy.

I will join you in donating as well if you’re right. Except I’ll donate to ALS research instead ��

They're probably thinking if they post enough predictions, one is bound to be right! Then they will label themselves crypto advisors and the sheep will follow whatever fud they shit out.

Except for Satoshi ��

Plot twist: you have .0001 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:23:51
Agreed, I'm just waiting for bitcoin to go cold so I can buy and hold!
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:24:34
Thank you, thank you. You're far too kind!
For a first post, it's a good start.

This is way too cool! I wish it let me draw longer lines, but it's entertaining nonetheless lol. Thanks for sharing!
