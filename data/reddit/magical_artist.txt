Is that like a million bitcoin?
I kid, but I got out at $350. No idea what they're worth now days.
...if only I mined thousands and sold when they were over 1k a pop...

Are you happy with your government? I am a US/Canadian dual citizen, and am considering re-locating to Canada.

What do you base this on?
Personally I bought in on Coinbase yesterday for 7 BTC (my daily purchase limit).
Was it the cheapest? No. About $412 each. 
However, the trend with BTC is that a story comes out about china being silly, or the US marshals raiding Butterfly Labs, and the market takes a brief dip. I got in because I thought this was a dip. However the trend for the last 3 months is a slow but steady decline.
I do hope adoption continues to increase, and companies like Newegg and Overstock being onboard will hopefully help the long term potential.

I was hoping to learn about this exact subject, as if I acquire enough wealth, I hope to retire as an ex-pat. 
I was under the impression that if you lived abroad you weren't taxed until certain levels. Even that seems BS, because there is a chance I will one day be making enough to be taxed, even if I never return to the US, and why should I pay taxes for country I do not even reside in? Is that what you mean?
EDIT: And to clarify, Canada does not tax you if you live outside the country?

I was said when I purchased 7 BTC for $412 each 4 days ago, and then they went below $400. Now Coinbase shows $440!
