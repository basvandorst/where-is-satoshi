Only setting is to slecet using change addresses, and it's checked.
Receive tab does show a used change address with two TX but zero balance.
Wallet was encrypted with a 16 character password.

Password was unique and memorized.  Just realized the private key export doesn't require the wallet password.  Most likely, don't know how but someone was able to copy this export csv file.

How would I check, my wallet shows a balance of zero.

Thanks for the reply.  I downloaded Cryptocoins consulting distribution image and installed onto SD card, put said card in Raspberry Pi and booted.  Electrum is already installed.  Once it starts it generates a key for your wallet.  I transfered coins for cold storage to this wallet.   I backed up wallet to afiles on a USB key. Also had a 12-word electrum seed.  Just tested wallet password and it was encrypted, password was 16 characters.  I never sent BTC from this address as I was holding. So not like to be change address either.
Quick search for pi wallet doesn't find other cases of missing BTC.  That is strange like the were scanning addresses that had more than 1.0 btc.

Most likly explanition is: On my USB stick,  there is a exported private key csv file, when opened it shows all wallet public and matching private keys.  Just searched all my computers for this file and didnt find it. This file is on the SD card too. Although both the SD card and USB never left my house,  somehow someone must of been able to copy this file from the SD card or USB stick.  This file does not require the wallet password to see/use the private keys.

At 40 connections now after restarting yesterday and updating bitcoind using aptitude on Ubuntu server, glad the latest version was available as a package.  I have seen it around 80 before.

Losing 1.19 Btc is not funny.  I thought by using pi wallet and a USB backup I was my own safe bank.  How was  I comprimised? Did some guess my 12 word electrum seed?

Thanks jmw74, all good points.
1) software used was electrum. 
2) Although I downloaded right ftom pi-wallet.Com, I will try to verify checksum.
3) Yes, just noticed private key export doesn't require password to show private key.

The two used addresses are in the OP.
