It's really crazy to think this about to be the THIRD cycle I go through in this market.

Wow great detective work lol.   
Everyone knows that countries use *everything* at their disposal to win battles, that of course includes their money and financial systems/networks.  Heck one could argue this is a non-statement considering money is literally used to buy weapons too.

I mean yeah - Bitmain wasn't happy with having a near monopoly on the crazy lucrative mining market... they had to also start f'ing around with altcoins.  Some of them are worth the effort for profit, but backing BCH was the single dumbest thing I have ever seen a company do.  God the Billions they must have lost from that... and they could have spent it on 7nm ASIC's.
Now they are starting to get REAL competition in the BTC mining market, and it will only get worse when Samsung and Intel show up.

Man the greed.  95% of their transactions were btc with fat profits, but that wasnt enough - they also had to shill a shit coin.
It's like people buying altcoins because for some reason a 50x of their investment isn't good enough, they want 1000x or nothing.  So I guess they will get nothing.

Incredibly easy answer - Buy $200 worth now, and then once a week for the next 50 weeks.  If you see it hit $2000 buy 2 BTC immediately, and if you see it hit $1000 put the rest of your investment in.
