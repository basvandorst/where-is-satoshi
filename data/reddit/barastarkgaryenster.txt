It still is. But you need to filter the memes and price posts.

It is. However, it is impossible to prove without reasonable doubt.
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:25:03
Hahaha this definitely caught me off guard

But no btc was traded. Only cash, betting on a btc price.

I'll give you an upvote not because I agree with you but because you are engaging in good conversation.
An altcoin could surpass Bitcoin. Anything is possible. However, as of now, no altcoin is as descentralized and antifragile as Bitcoin. And almost any good "feature" an altcoin proposes can be implemented in Bitcoin.

This dependes entirely on you. Just to an amount you are confortable every paycheck.
Or go nuts and buy a lot today.

Mexico is not developing it's own government crypto my dude

If you don't have much, get a Phone wallet like Samourai.
If you have a lot, get a Trezor or Ledger.
How to know if you have too much? Just think how you would feel if you lost it.

I stopped betting on NBA games after I put my first $ in Bitcoin. Kind of got my fix on uncertainty.

i am not an inmigrant or anyone I know, but I am sure many have migrated legally and still want to send money. Many have learned the language. Many have assimilated to their local culture (there is no one USA culture by the way). Many do pay taxes even while illegal. Definitely many contribute.
Blocking remmitances will only create a black market for transfers.
By the way, it if its worth anything for this conversation, I would like to inmigrate legally (not to US though) and it is very very very difficult but I won't go illegaly.

Just today I saw with my kids and they were talking about the shared economy (Uber, AirBnb) and its troubles.
From the top of my mind they have talked about Daylight savings, the housing bubbles and other real world problems, and it's hilarious.

I appreciate taking the time to type this and trying to help. I am also glad you are making money on the trades (I do not have the confidence on beating the market, so I stay out of trading).
Regarding the question of 'what fundamentals'? It is not about transaction volume or usage (I agree with you on the opaqueness of transactions).
Bitcoin value derives mostly from scarcity, stock-to-flow ratio and its antifragile architecture. These characteristics are still strong.
I don't speak for other investors. It is a long term bet. A risky one, with the possibilty of assimetric returns.
For anyone else reading this, only invest in this kind of asset with money you are willing to lose and that is not needed soon.

Trezor or Ledger is your friend.

You don't need cardio, you only need a long enough caloric deficit.
