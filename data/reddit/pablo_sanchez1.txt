New to bitcoin and currently using Coinbase to purchase (brd to store), what would you suggest instead?

I literally just bought my first bitcoin today and came straight to this sub for some information. What do you mean by it can be stolen in an instant and how do I avoid that?

Thank you!

You have no idea what you’re talking about. “Leftist ideology is based on emotions, not in facts” is such a dumb vague fucking blanket statement that has no basis in reality. Also we don’t keep on losing, pretty sure we just had an 8 year Obama presidency and now the republican candidate is on the brink of impeachment, rightfully so because he’s a criminal.
By the way, everybody in the world is a hypocrite, especially in politics. Accusing your opposing side of being based on emotions and ignoring facts while you support the climate change denying, anti-abortion, 2nd amendment obsessed, tax breaks for the rich side is WILDLY hypocritical.

I’ll keep on buying just enough that it literally doesn’t affect me at all every payday regardless of what it’s worth. Not planning on caring at all about the value until years from now

I’m new to bitcoin, and have seen “not your keys not your bitcoin” a lot on here. Would you mind explaining that to me briefly? I just bought my first on Coinbase and transferred it to BRD. Is there a different way I should be doing it?

Thanks for the advice man! I’ll look into a hardware wallet ASAP
