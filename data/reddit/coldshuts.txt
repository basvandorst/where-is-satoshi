Low transaction fees? Traders charge between 3 to 7% to get bitcoin. This needs to change. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:03:29
Bitcoin envahi la belle province! 
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:49:16
They have an API but it's probably in beta. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:37:02
Still, someone could trick me in looking something in their cell. So easily exploitable.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:32:42
Even if they are not pimped, the current capitalism system force them to sell their body because they probably have no other skills that they know. Maybe if they could have a better education, better support, they would have been able to have a serious career. Not saying prostitution should be illegal, but it's not because that they are not pimped that it's their dream job. No little girl dream of sucking an old fart's cock when they get older. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:45:02
I wish, but I work for a big corporation and they don't turn around on a dime. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:36:20
You should tell your SO he can buy [lingerie]( with bitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-22 02:24:30
That's why I say they are victims of capitalism. Education should be free and single moms should not have to suck dicks to succeed. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 01:11:49
Yes, I'm the ceo of bitcoin, please refer to our complain departement. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:21:25
It looks like a failed poutine.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:48:23
Someone need to open some code to start with.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:20:03
It still adds to the transaction fees. Don't get me wrong, I want bitcoins to work, seriously, but traders need to lower their fees!
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:33:06
Is it safe? I mean, someone could scan it in a crowded area and I wouldn't even notice it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:40:09
You should have quoted the whole sentence at least. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:41:37
I don't know why you get downvoted, you're right. Here it's called UberX and when they get caught, their car is being seized. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:28:40
Then is for you. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 06:17:29
Montréal, Québec. The Bureau du Taxi is the department doing all the seizures. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:48:09
Well, I can order my stuff all by myself, I don't see any added value. Also, the fact that the founder claims that he used the service nonstop since he found it (the domain is one day old) smells fishy.
I wouldn't trust them, beware people.
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:04:19
Wow, 1$ per day, I should quit my day job! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:39:49
Yeah, because people you care about, outside of the internet, are not rude like anonymous teens on reddit. I think you've hit part of the reason why I can't sell the idea, money is in fact taboo for some people. The other part of the reason is probably because I'm a poor seller and I should not quit my daytime job to sell filterqueens.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:35:14
You should download bitaddress.org's page on a live usb key and boot your computer offline to generate a wallet. That's how I did all my wallets.
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:23:22
What are we waiting to support his? BTC is going mainstream sooner than later, we should have a strategy, something to offer to merchants and consumers. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:37:47
Open your source code and we might consider it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:30:18
So you invested like a thousand bucks on BTC and now you're almost millionaire and you don't want to pay your taxes? Go fuck yourself.
Seriously, cash what you can and pay your taxes. You can still get a house with 300k$. Don't be THAT guy. I bet when you were poor you were complaining about the rich evading taxes...
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:21:25
Someone should opensource and release for free a trader code to have more of these.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:48:23
Yeah I'll try this one for my next batch. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:08:25
Yeah except at a bank's website they can block me from retrying more than a couple of times.
It's easier to bruteforce, I'm generating like 20keys/s on a small and cheap laptop.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:03:24
I'm not giving you reddit gold, but I can give you an upvote because you definetely deserve good karma for spreading your wealth like this. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:55:35
So because it's BTC, we can't complain? I don't think so. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 23:06:25
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:57:18
We could still fork to a new blockchain and ignore them?
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:13:02
Next time, do a bill pay, it takes 24h.
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:18:39
I prefer to use bitaddress.org offline to generate my paper wallets. I like the template and it works on any distros.
@_date: 2013-03-11 13:51:19
If I would have to do a site, I would try opencart with the bitpay extensions. 
edit: I thought canadianbitcoins was a site that sells stuff... I should have clicked the link before commenting.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:53:35
Yeah, sure, your "friend" 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:01:50
I see what you did here.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:43:55
So if I have a business that sells coffee for 50 cents, I should forget about bitcoins? That sucks. If you want Bitcoins to go mainstream, you better support all kinds of transactions. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:58:24
144$ now...! I bought mine at 46 less than a month ago! That's crazy!!!
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:51:01
In Canada, you need a very special permit, for your job, to carry a concealed weapon. Anyways, you don't get robbed here so you don't need to carry a weapon. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:51:14
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:03:36
I don't believe in your conscience bullshit, I think you can't convince anyone because you have no friends anyways. Maybe your deaf granma might sign you a check if you fool her.
@_date: 2013-08-15 08:02:18
Yeah it will just cover the transaction fees.... oh wait!
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:29:33
Hi, you have the best block chain explorer and online wallet. When are you gonna support altcoins like Litecoin or can you open source it? Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-06-29 22:20:24
Plot twist: he IS Satoshi. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:35:23
That's your opinion. Corporations are making a big load of money and benefit at least, as much as any citizens, if not more, from society (roads, services, subsidies, etc). I really don't see why they should be exempted from taxes. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:25:00
Well, my PS3 is still unhacked. Yes, I know geohotz came close, but it was never widespread. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:56:59
One thing I love about Virtex is the Bill Pay. In less than 24h, I can get money directly from my bank account to their site.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:22:43
How come? 
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:42:44
Make it happen! 
@_date: 2013-10-02 11:29:01
How can you get to 1000 if you can't get to 5? That's a little first step for a man, but a huge step for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:38:24
Free advertisement on global networks, followed by media coverage proving that altruism still exists is bad? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:10:00
They benefit from the people that are basically educated by the state. They also benefit from the good health of the people (Subsidized by the state almost everywhere except in the US) , they benefit from the roads, railroads, airports, and all infrastructures, they benefit from the police service, firefighters, etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:49:52
I usually downvote the ones paging him because it's getting old.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:47:17
Then move to sierra leone, you won't have to pay any taxes, but make sure you hire personnal body guards because your rich white ass is gonna be an easy target. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:51:27
Can you enable 2FA on transactions bigger than x mBTC only? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:03:09
Any Linode customers here? I asked them about bitcoin and they told me they don't accept it yet, maybe if we put some pressure on them they will start to work on it!
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:28:52
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:20:05
I'd be more than happy to pay my taxes for these services, but I don't wanna pay for a useless senate, a "lieutenant-governor" and for anti-justin propaganda.
@_date: 2013-03-11 05:49:37
I would love to see them integrating bitcoins into their payment system!
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:55:24
It's hard to say why you don't sell if you don't show us. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:38:29
Are you trying to evade taxes? If yes, that sucks. Even if your incorporated in the blockchain, your company and you benefit from being in your country. You should pay your fair share of taxes. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:51:02
Exchange need to limit orders. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:35:11
This bubble is being pumped by BTC China, let's hope they don't gox it up! 
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:13:43
Dude, at least wait their refusal before you offer money! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:31:39
I got it, it's just not funny. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:20:10
How do I get the public key from the private key?
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:02:07
Don't promote this junk.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:49:12
yeah maybe I bragged too much.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:10:59
I generated 10 offline wallets and printed them with the QR codes. When I need to send coins, I put some on my blockchain wallet and the rest to a new offline wallet. I have 2 copies of these wallets, for offsite storage.
@_date: 2013-03-11 05:48:48
Yes, but bitcoinstore is for people that already know and use bitcoin. The majors would bring A LOT of new players to the game.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:12:29
No, I was kidding Sheldon. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:22:48
I read top within the last hour. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:14:45
Well, it's a good time to promote bitcoin. I hope more shits like this happens everywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:18:51
that might turn out to be a 2000$ tip in a couple of months.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:15:07
They're just expensive.
@_date: 2013-03-11 08:39:04
yeah but some people are afraid of the Internet. My mother for example only buys from majors because she's scared of big bad internets. She's never gonna buy from an 'obscur' website like that. She's never gonna buy bitcoins also, unless Google or Paypal sell them.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:33:59
Not all government are robbers and thugs. If the tax rate is that high, he must benefits from services like free health care, free education and stuff like this. If he doesn't want to pay those taxes, he can move to a country with no such services. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 19:30:07
Wow this site has been designed in the 90's.
I bet it's hosted on geocities.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:54:41
And who's gonna wait your table? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:31:19
Yeah they could just shred them, or simply generate new keys. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:36:35
What's the point of having bitcoins if we still depend on a third party. I thought bitcoins were replacing cash and plastic money? 
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:49:40
Have a happy reddit nameday friend, thanks for what you're doing. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:09:09
We are very busy this weekend but we might stop! Adding the event to my calendar. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:49:15
Closed source. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:16:05
Another concern here:
I think you already replied to that guy, but I'm still concerned that most of the wealth is centralized and that the founders are self proclaim billionaires. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:35:18
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:00:39
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:26:20
I'm one of those. I might sell one at 1000$ just to pay for my investment, but my 9 other bitcoins are going to sit in my wallet for a while.
It's raising like this for no reason, just imagine if a major player like Google or Amazon accept them... It's gonna be crazy!!
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:32:45
They trade Bitcoins at half the price though, I doubt it's gonna work. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:29:21
Yes it's bad. Just buy what you can with your extra cash. When it's gonna reach 10k$, you're gonna be happy to have bought some at 140$.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:49:44
Can you add  please? They are the biggest trader in Canada.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:57:16
Give this guy reddit gold, I'm too poor.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:51:56
If people can be evangelising with their imaginary gods, why can't I be with real currency?
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:18:06
I had .69btc, I sent 0.0005 + 0.0005 fees, and I sent 0.0055.
On blockchains it says the wallet is empty, but on my PC I have 0.6835BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:40:10
Have a look at datacoin and secure coin, they are the real innovators, like namecoin. Quarks are premined bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:44:30
I appreciate you said this repeatedly because my wife and I followed this hint. We bought for 600$ in the last month, we're a bit sad because we are not going to be millionnaire soon but we're fine with loosing our investment. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:01:36
Sorry about that, I was so excited when I saw this that I posted it with my phone. I should have double checked the url.
