I moved my BTC to my Ledger, why not? It's safer there anyhow..
You will receive your B2X if you store your BTC in your Ledger, everybody that owns bitcoin before the fork will also own an equal amount in B2X afterwards.
What old private key? I don't understand the question.
I would recommend you try to learn a lot of the basics of Bitcoin and read up on all the subjects that you are wondering about.
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:47:28
Anyone who claims to know what Bitcoins value is gonna be at any given time is lying. The value of your BTC has nothing to do with where you store them?????
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:40:03
You can use Gdax to buy your BTC and send it to your coinbase wallet afterwards without paying any fees.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:46:32
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:49:42
Bitcoins value has risen tremendously and fast!
This has attracted the "get rich fast and easy" dreamers..
If you would wildly guess, how much of bitcoins current community consist of pure speculators?

I was in your position 2 months ago, I made my first purchase through Coinbase since their user interface is really friendly and easy to navigate. At this moment I have several wallets but I'm a hodler so I have almost all of my BTC in my Ledger Nano S that I just got 2 days ago!
So my tip would be to just buy some BTC at the exchange you feel comfortable with and if you're planning to hodl it would be a good idea to buy a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S or Trezor) to store your BTC in for the long haul.
TL;DR Just try what feels best, Coinbase has an easily navigable UI, in the long haul I recommend getting a hardware wallet though, Ledger Nano S and Trezor are the most popular ones.

I wish to find more information about this topic!
* Is it really true? 
* What does this really result in?
* What implications can this have? 
* How can this be solved?
this topic deserves a separate thread!

How is the support for European customers on Gemini? Does SEPA- payments work will with them?

Isn't fractional reserve banking the creation of new money out of thin air via a loan?
How would you go about creating new bitcoins out of thin air? As far as I'm aware that's impossible.

I have no idea why people are so rude towards OP, he has said several times that he's here to learn and is listening. Still you guys have nothing of value to add to the conversation other than being plain rude towards OP.
Instead of criticizing him for not having the same opinions or knowing as much as you do try to share your knowledge and teach him instead?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:34:58
true shit, I feel even more conflicted now that it's risen to over 5600$ though.. Holy shit it's been a crazy fast increase.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:19:39
exactly my thought, Bitcoins and a Tesla equals my future hopefully :D
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:09:04
Competitors without any infrastructure built around it, Bitcoins advantage is that it is the first of it's kind. All the infrastructure such as exchanges, apps, wallets and other companies that's built around Bitcoin will have to be built around the competitor for it to have a chance against Bitcoin. Also, to be entirely decentralized without a central structure and manage to get adopters will be incredibly hard. I believe Bitcoin has become a pretty strong brand as the real cryptocurrency and will be the one to rule if it doesn't get killed before it reaches that stage.
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:25:38
I see what you did there :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:18:14
Yeah I actually just sent my BTC from Coinbase to my Ledger Nano S Segwit wallet and I payed a fee of approximately 1.4 usd.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:24:35
Did actually not know that, that's awesome mate!
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:40:19
How long do I have until it's to late to remove my bitcoins from Coinbase? I just bought a Ledger Nano S and I'm currently waiting on it to arrive sometime in the next 2 - 3 weeks. Will it be to late by then? if that's the case, where should I move my BTC in the meanwhile?
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:18:57
Well let's say I would send it from my Ledger Nano S to my Mycelium, how would I know which chain would be used?

Why use a desktop wallet? They are not as safe as a wallet on ur phone...
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:59:49
I have a Ledger Nano S and I like it.
Get whichever suits you best, I chose the Ledger since it seems to be more robust and I enjoyed the look of it more than the Trezor. 
**+ it's cheaper.**

Can you name a competitor that is dezentralized and have improvements that exceeds Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:45:10
How can one know which chain they use while transacting?

Thanks, I'm from the Nordic region so will definitely check this out tomorrow! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:45:01
yeah me to!
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:40:38
Won't the transaction fees be extremely expensive in the future then?
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:02:06
Yeah thats how I've understood it aswell, so that's why I think it'll be fine if you transfer your coins to a wallet instead of keeping them on an exchange. 
Information will probably be available right before/during or after the fork with instructions on how to access the new coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:09:16
Peter, is that you?
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:46:56
Will it be the same with a Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:12:25
Why not Breadwallet on Android? :&gt;
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:27:56
Same here boys, started this month and currently at 0.1!
I'm conflicted about buying now or wait until after the fork because it might dip.. Hell I dunno, will probably end up buying in the weekend or something. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:13:28
If I'm not all to wrong I believe having them on any wallet will be the safe option (owning your own bitcoin). So maybe download a wallet on your smartphone and store it there until the fork is over and it's safe to transfer it to your Ledger.
**Mycelium is a good one for android**

How would I know what version I'm going to run then? hehe :&gt;

Haha thank you dear sir, the rest of us will now HODL!
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:00:10
Sorry for being unclear, how would I know if the core version or btc1 version is being used in the transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:29:36
Good to hear, then I will absolutely use the Segwit wallet since it has lower fees who wouldn't? :)

Since most companies only profit from supporting multiple coins it is given that they will. Im not a hardcore believer that Bitcoin Will succeed, I do believe that alot of development must occur before major adoption is possible. Still I believe that the changes that are needed can be implemented into Bitcoin and will if it doesn't kill it first..

Does anyone know when S2X will be pushed through?
