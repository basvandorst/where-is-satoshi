Speaking of the original Bitcoin paper... where is it?

I hope people at Google finally adds Bitcoin-to-other-currency conversion if we all set it as our personal homepage

Same MD5. The fact that it was last modified in the SourceForge repo the exact same day that is reported in the file's metadata could mean the file was actually modified right before uploading it to the repo.
Maybe whoever uploaded it (e.g. Sirius, Gavin, Satoshi) made a slight modification and that changed the file creation date. I still don't think a false date was put there intentionally.

Saving to a CSV file would be enough for most of the people out there. I bet they don't care downloading 47 MB instead of 26 MB. If you want filtering capabilities, consider using Google Fusion Tables. It will provide the necessary tools for online filtering, simplistic data analysis and visualization.

Thanks! Not my first time though.

They are giving a pretty good overview about Bitcoin: distributed exchanges, payment processors, ATMs, debit cards, legal issues...

I think the same happens for every other currency conversion (e.g. USD to EUR). In the end, a good average is what counts. 
For currency rates they use the "Citibank Currency Rates":

Good point, thanks

The PDF is also stored in this transaction:
Need some help to download it.

Transaction was made in April 2013 so, probably, we won't find anything new.

The URL I'm suggesting searches for "1 BTC to USD" at Google.com. We may argue indefinitely on the possibility of Google knowing what homepage people are using but, believe me, they know what you search for.

True. In fact my compression tool reports something is wrong with the compression format. Why not to upload it in a harmless format? No compression, no macros, no nothing... so that everyone can safely check it.

What about this? 
You can find more Bitcoin Network visualizations in

I find it hard to believe. Why would it be so important to hide every little detail?
More details:

Should we think they were all carefully crafted?

Weird, same MD5sum

You claim to have the original bitcoin.pdf document but... what about this?
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:16:53
Good point. First snapshot in Wayback Machine dates back to 04 Jul 2010. Unfortunately, that is the same version which is currently online.

Blank lines got imported as well. It would be nice to have it fixed (including a couple of other issues).
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:06:06
Yeah, I believe so. Anyway, to sum up (and for the record) the version they are talking about seems to be the same that is currently hosted in

I have been going through the list's archive and could not find the post you are referring to? Could you please link it here?
Finally found something that looks promising, will have a look at it. Thanks for pointing it out.
