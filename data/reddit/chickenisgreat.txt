Clicked through to the comments to say the same thing - I'm certainly not ashamed of my professional success on the shoulders of .NET. If there were any recent event I'd expect to see an "no longer ashamed" post for, it's the recent open-sourcing of .NET and the fact that VS Pro is free now for individual developers. The fact that a completely different arm of this gigantic company started accepting Bitcoin for recharging digital goods wallets wouldn't factor into my choice of a platform at all.

I've had PressureNet running for a few weeks now, and the charts it outputs are pretty cool. I work on the ninth floor of a building, and it's cool to be able to see exactly when I entered and left work - the pressure drops and spikes accordingly. So, yes, if you added micropayments to the mix, it's just icing on the cake :)

Some scarf or something that my girlfriend saw and wanted. She was starting to pay cash and I saw the Bitcoin sign behind the cashier. I asked if I could pay that way instead, and she thought I was joking at first - when she realized I was serious, she started yelling for the owner. "This guy wants to pay with Bitcoins!" They came running, it was awesome. Since it was their first transaction they didn't quite have the hang of the merchant app, but we got it figured out.

I have no idea what I'm talking about, but indoor environments aren't waaaay off from the pressure outside necessarily, and I think the idea is that if you get enough data points, you can spot trends - the indoor and outdoor readings just give an average that moves up and down with actual outside pressure changes. And from that, they can wrap models around it. Again, absolutely no idea what I'm talking about.

This is about as badass as the Overstock news, to me. Price/fees aside, insured storage removes a lot of the anxiety over holding BTC.

Intermittently having problems for me, in both Firefox and Chrome. Complains about a cert error being signed to a cloudflare domain instead of coinbase.com.

I was their first customer to use it. They were so excited.

I'm excited. I'd call out that this is more Bitcoin the *protocol* than Bitcoin the *currency* when dealing with people like that in the future.
Seriously, can't wait to read the whitepaper, I was thinking about this the other day. And I'm a developer, so I might just hit y'all up.

Lemme check this out.

I have been really looking into Bitcoin the protocol, not the currency. I've seen it described as "Bitcoin is a protocol and currency is just the first app." It's like an API for money that I think has some powerful uses once fully realized. I implore you to check out the different types of [contracts]( and the [scripting language]( inside of transactions that allows for some interesting financial vehicles. Investigate too the [Distributed Autonomous Corporation]( - there's some cool ideas floating around - [StorJ]( should stoke your interest.
I'm just now diving deep into it, and there's a lot to learn. I could send you a few whitepapers too if interested, but some of them are over my head right now.

While I don't have friends **ever** ask me for money like OP's do, I have another problem after talking about owning them - people want to comment on it all the time. "Holy shit dude, you lost like 50% after the crash, I bet!" I'm a very long-term holder, so no; you only lock in a loss when you sell. Or they want to get in on the speculation and want my "expert" advice, when in actuality I don't have a clue how to trade and time markets. I just believe in the long-term benefit.
