Yeah, no one should use it as their main wallet if they have a significant amount of crypto.  I have to say though, it has been a pretty awesome app for me! mainly used to move crypto around on while on the go.

But bitcoin price crashed right before his death! 
J/k (I dunno. Even if it did he was sick and dying from MRSA)
As for the bullet holes in his body, if his death was presumed natural it is safe to assume none. County medical exam records are generally public domain so it would be easy for one to verify.

I don't think it's necessary for this sub. 
Also, one can make an argument that the best subs have the strongest memes.  On the flip side I can think of a few shitcoins where the memes are entirely based on negativity.
