it is a scam when people invest money into a coin thinking it's the real deal when it's not. It is a scam when the founder of this very coin is putting his best effort into persuading those investors that the real coin is in fact "experimental" and "operated for two years only".
This is money we are talking about, not just some hypothetical ideas or vision.

and then  writes: "Bitcoin.com agrees that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin."

are you insane? this currency is listed on legitimate exchanges and people invest real money into it. If some idiot created fake Apple accounts claiming they were the real Apple, for instance, then listed themselves on stock exchanges and started trading, would you also think it's not Twitter's job to remove this scam? 
Claiming that BCH is "the oldest currency" that existed before BTC and that Satoshi's whitepaper was created for BCH, and then follow those damn claims with the "even bitcoin.com agrees" is fucking crazy. 
I could care less who thinks what when it comes to the direction Bitcoin should take. But when you are a fork, you came second, you have a minority support and that's an indisputable fact, position yourself as an altcoin. 
BCH is a scam that's trying to trick people into buying it. Period.

Indirectly it is. They use fake info to drive people to invest into their alternative coin by telling those same people that BTC is not a real Bitcoin, white BCH is.
Their [Bitcoin Cash Twitter account]( doesn't generate nearly as much followers as their [Bitcoin account]( (100k vs 900k). This alone speaks volume. I would imagine that folks who actually support BCH would follow their BCH twitter as well. Which likely means that a good portion of  followers do it either out of curiosity or because they don't realize this is fake. I myself did not immediately realize I followed a fake account.
Again, they can spread their fake nonsense under any other account, but  (one of the largest bitcoin news account simply based on its username) should not be about bcash. Simple as that.

I am not suggesting censorship. They can spread their nonsense under an appropriate username, which in this case is "Bitcoin Cash". What they do is they try to create confusion on purpose. And by doing so they raise the price of their shitcoin. 
Bcash is trading higher than any other alt at the moment.

Thanks for the info! I was under impression that the dollar value is irrelevant when calculating fees. What's relevant is the "weight" of the transaction which is why I have setup per kB fees. I will consider having higher fees when I send lightweight, but higher value transactions, though.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:59:47
Perfect, thanks! Should I double my current /kB fee to avoid issues in the future? I don't like letting my wallet decide because I remember when I first installed it, the default fee was on the highest recommended end (don't remember details, though).
Edit: I'm looking at Electrum now, it has dynamic fees where it says "Fee per kilobyte of transaction. If you enable dynamic fees, this parameter will be used as upper bound." Do I understand correctly that if I set, let's say, 0.0005 BTC/kB and check "dynamic fees", Electrum will choose the cheapest option, but not higher than 0.0005/kB? So this way I can have a considerably higher BTC/kB when needed, but that won't be a typical fee for transactions that don't require it. I'm not sure if what I've just written is comprehensible, though, lol.

it's not a *currency*, it's a *payment method*. Big difference, hence, non taxable.

 "Our international power comes from USD being the standard unit of intl finance... USD is critical for major oil transactions". 
You know how the Feds are sticking their nose into other jurisdictions threatening to shut down access to dollar unless they cooperate? Well, crypto might seriously undermine their hegemony and this video is proof of that. In other words, oil companies and other billionaires dominating the world (and funding politicians to support their greedy endeavors) are really fucking scared. Controlling fucks who are destroying our environment, who turn our food and water into toxic poison, who are brainwashing populations into buying junk that they don't need, who start wars, who are torturing animals to increase profit, are fucking scared of bitcoin. Good!!!
