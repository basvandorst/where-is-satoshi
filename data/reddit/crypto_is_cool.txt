Guilty until proven innocent. The founding fathers are rolling in their graves.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Krugman is literally the old man yelling at ~~clouds~~ capitalism meme.
Lest we forget him predicting in the 90s that the internet would have no more economic impact than a fax machine.

Ron is such a gangsta. I wish his son was as firm in his convictions.

Amen. Regulations helped keep them in power and bailouts maintained their monopoly when the market tried to end it. The government is the problem here, not deregulation.

Krugman may be one of the highest functioning mentally handicapped people in the world.

This is probably a dumb question, but since Gemini has removed limit buys/sells from their platform, I'm moving back to Coinbase Pro.
How do you calculate what price you are setting your limit buy at? 
Say I want to buy $25 worth of BTC when it hits $7,000, how do I calculate that since the buy window doesn't have a price? It's just the amount of BTC you want to buy and how much you want to buy it for.
Is there an algorithm you can use?
