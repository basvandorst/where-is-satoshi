So someone help me understand, please?  
A company that was working on a huge, low input mining machine for bitcoins has failed as a startup, and then failed for a successful transfer of operations for this piece of hardware. Am I correct so far?

Wait what?  
Please tell me how buying a gun from the internet automatically makes me a criminal?

How many?? Well hell just walk into your local grocery store or mall or bank and count to five.  
That is the average draw time for anyone in a crowd of people.  
Best an average pistol will hold is about 15-16. Not good for crowded areas.  
Shotgun shoots pellets and inflicts massive damage close - medium range - but is shit with people running away.  
Machine gun - is great for spray and pray - but gets your accuracy all messed up when you don't burst fire.  
Explosives can either be thrown and triggered or timed. Most of the damage is concussion or shrapnel related.  
I think the first matter that needs to be handled is getting politicians to understand that guns don't kill people.  
People kill people. A gun is a non-biased tool, in a nutshell. What matters is who is holding that gun and what their agenda is.

I'm curious if they built this whole company up under the guise of a pure bitcoin miner, and failed to see it through.

I must apologize, in this instance; as I thought you were attempting to make a point of such as:  
if you buy a gun online - you are no worse than a person who where to commit a crime with a gun - which is absurd.  
I bought a colt .45 from an online auction, I haven't killed anyone, nor do I have intentions of doing so.  
The funny thing that I think many people overlook is that there are other things besides guns that can kill.  
I could make an explosive that you would never know was there.  
Extract poison and inject your food with it.  
Mix your medications so it looked like you over-dosed.  
Take a stick and shave it into a knife point.  
Dig a hole and build a pit trap.  
Rig any number of mechanical items you interact with on a daily basis to break and kill or maim.  
And yet you are worried about *guns*?  
Now, to be fair - there are evil people in the world, there always will be. But I think it is wrong to take the approach of:  
Well this guy over here knows how to kill with a beanbag chair - so we are going to have to outlaw all beanbag chairs because it is the only way to stop this from happening again.  
**FALSE!** You want to know how to stop people from doing bad shit? You teach them the difference between right and wrong.  
However I have strayed...  
Untraceable crimes? When you purchase a firearm in the United States - the feds make you fill out all this paperwork, the serial number of the gun, all your information, home address, date of birth; all that stuff and the like - and then you are off. 
Trust me when I say this, big brother knows everything about you. All nice and compact, streamlined - if they wanted someone - they would get them, but they don't. Our government (USA) is so damned corrupt - they **LET** Mexican Drug Cartels *have our fucking weapons, free of charge* ... 
Look up [Operation Fast and Furious] (  
You want to talk about "Untraceable Crimes" with the application towards civilians? Try looking at the government.
