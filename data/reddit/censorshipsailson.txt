Or 5$/mo for a bunch of stuff worth paying for.

Oh shut the fuck up you fucking pawn.

Good luck tracing a lightning transaction which spans multiple nodes.

Oooo nice argument!  No fallacies there!  Nevermind that FDIC insurance covers only 250k per bank.  So someone with 100mil would only need to find...400 different banks!  Retard.

lol no they don't.  You don't have a clue man.  If they want risk-free savings, they'll use treasury bonds.  They aren't relying on FDIC insurance.

Yes it is.  You're spreading central bank fud.  Go ahead -- give me an argument that would convince a blue collar worker it'd be beneficial for his wages and savings to lose value every year.

Not sure what gave you that idea.  I have a very good understanding of inflation, don't worry.


I'm looking for you to convey to the working class why it's good for their wages and savings to be devalued.  I'm waiting...






My salary is actually 100% bitcoin.  So yes, I'm always spending bitcoin.


Ok, let's hear it.

Apart from how absurd it would be for the wealthy to use hundreds of banks to hold their savings, sure.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:00:04
That the above attempt to correlate addresses with number of users/owners of bitcoin is basically useless.

You said you'd give me a rational argument justifying a 2% inflation target from the Fed if I answered your questions.
I answered your questions, and now you're running away from what you promised.
I can only presume you either don't have a good enough understanding of inflation to put together an argument, or, upon hearing me define inflation as "the devaluing of wages and savings" you've realized there's no argument that'd convince the working class it's to their benefit.

told me this was impossible and lightning doesn't work.
