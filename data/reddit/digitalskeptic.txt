I think that misses the point Collins is trying to make. His point is, as a commodity, Bitcoin is awesome. But as a true currency, it does not meet the standard for storing value over time. 
Which is born out by the literature in the FAQ on Bitcoin.org.
You might disagree, but this is a professional money manage for a major non-profit who has been very successful in emerging financial technologies. 
I think that might be an overstatement.

You know what, I may have totally misunderstood this. What my understanding of this was, value is being sucked out the system. Not that Bitcoin is not secure. That that over all macroeconomics of it indicates not every dollar of fiat currency going in results in Bitcoin going out. 
So it opens the system up bets about the currency. Not if the transaction is secure. 
See what I was trying to say. 
But excellent point for sure

Well, I think might want to read the research first. That team has one of the best web security people I have ever spoken with, named Stefan Savage on the team.
Here take a look at his work. He was the first to hack a car, has done several very interesting looks at Bitcoin And broken down spam feeds and issues with porn sites. 
Go take a look, and then post a comment. Stefan is a great guy,
