Miners have full latitude to choose what transactions to include. Some may be honoring the old school policy. But I don't think there can be a definitive source on this sort of thing. I guess you could look at the reference implementation but I imagine many miners are using a customized tx picker at this point.

I have a Trezor and Nano S, so I can provide some color here. Admittedly I just got the Nano S a couple days ago so not fully versed on it yet.
One of the Trezor pros is that you can use the wallet of your choice. With the Nano S you have to use their application. But it is possible to write an adapter for your favorite wallet, so I imagine those will be coming. I plan to work on one for `geth` when I get a chance. I'm also not sure if this statement is true for BTC (haven't moved any of that off Trezor yet).
One of the big Nano S pros is support for multiple cryptos. It comes with ETH and ETC out of the box and the dev kit should make it easier to add other apps - including login 2FA and other cryptos. I know the Trezor has ETH support in the works but I'm not sure exactly how that is going to work.
Another Nano S plus is they really use the input buttons. So e.g. your PIN is entered directly on the device - whereas the Trezor PIN is obscured and entered on computer (which is a fine approach). But for seed restoration, you can do entirely on the Nano! Which is a bit more cumbersome (but not all that bad), and prevents your seed words from ever passing through your computer. Even in an obscured order I was still uncomfortable when recovering on my Trezor.
Hope that helps!

Ask if they do any long term investing. There is a difference between saving and investing, and no matter how little money you might have it is wise to do both. If they don't invest, explain the importance of long term investing. Then convince them that Bitcoin is a valuable (arguably necessary) part of an investment portfolio.
To do this, discuss the chicanery that is going down at central banks around the world. BoJ buying ETFs, ECB buying corporate debt, etc. This is not sustainable and just creating a bubble in the market. Best to have some non-correlated / inversely correlated assets.
Also if they only have a little bit to invest, it might not be worth to pay $10 per trade on the stock exchange, they can pay 0.25% on trades at a Bitcoin exchange.

Use a real exchange like Gemini instead of a retailer because your fees will be much lower. I'd recommend something like buying $1k/week or maybe less, so that you can dollar cost average your buy in price. We could easily retest 4-500 before the halvening squeeze.

The thing is.. this just doesn't make sense from a payment processor standpoint. It is absurd to require that a tx will confirm within 15 minutes, and generates a clear lack of understanding on the developer's side.
The average block time is 10 minutes. That means quite often it will happen that the time between blocks is greater than 15 minutes, making it impossible to successfully checkout. 
Every payment provider I've ever used has required that your tx be *published* to the network within 15 minutes, but then leaves ample time for a confirmation.
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:59:29
This has happened to me before as well. It will happen anytime their hot wallet is out of funds, or there is an outage.
You should know that if you use it at a physical POS, or even an online invoice with expiration timeout, Coinbase does not intend to refund you. Which fits with their recent blog post about not being a wallet.

Ethereum gets a lot of shit in this sub, but as someone whose day job is developing smart contracts, I can confidently say that it is the most exciting development since Bitcoin. It makes my job easier and makes smart contracts MUCH more expressive. Sure there are obvious growing pains but that's part of what makes it a great speculative investment (it's still very early). There's also a chance that RSK absorbs it's market cap but I don't see that terribly likely with a federated side chain. Side-note I hold a bunch of ETC as well in case ETH tries another bullshit fork.
I would also look into Dash and Monero, both doing work on obfuscation and fungibility. These are major problems for Bitcoin, and will get much much worse over the next two years. I have a moderate bet on each of these.
Lastly I would take a look at MaidSafe. They are doing cloud storage powered by a blockchain. Pretty cool idea. They have a competitor as well called storj that is a bit newer but also promising. Might want to put a small bet into one or both of those.
In closing, I wouldn't view alts as BTC challengers. There is a lot of business to be done on the Internet and that means space for a multitude of blockchains, with varying purposes. Be aware that not all of them will persist long term so speculate with caution. But hey, volatility is generally where you'll find the best returns! 
PS also take a look at Steemit. I haven't dug into it much and heard there are major problems with coin distribution, but it wouldn't surprise me to see one of the blockchain + social media platforms do really well.

Money at the bank can be seized by government without due process. It is also subject to a possible bail-in when GFC2 comes. Also my fiat savings is invisibly taxed by unfettered generation of new currency.
Also, their system for online payments is idiotic. It's a pull system instead of a push system which means that if any merchant you buy from, or bill pay, is compromised, an attacker can drain your entire account.

Well it's not just about getting everyone on the same page. There are a lot of technical advantages to having a varied crypto ecosystem. Different use cases require different features, and having all apps under the same coin is a form of centralization which makes it less resistant to failure.
That said, I think it would be possible (and make a lot of sense) to build a storage platform on top of ETH, and a social network as well. Could maybe tackle the obfuscation bit but I think that requires some very specific features.

I wouldn't say very little. The problem is getting paid well involves *many* factors: training, ability to negotiate, interpersonal skills, and lastly, how hard working you are.
If you *are* a very hard worker, that opens up the door to negotiate a raise or make a lateral move. But a hard worker that keeps their head down and doesn't advance their own interests will continue to be exploited.

It is allowed because the protocol doesn't specify any minimum size for a block, the only requirement is that all the transactions are valid and the hash value is below the difficulty threshold.
When a new block is received miners have to go through the mempool and remove all the mined transactions, drop double spends, and construct a new block based on the remaining transactions. This takes some non-trivial amount of time, and during that time, they mine assuming the previous block was valid, but just building an empty block for simplicity.
The only other option is to wait until they've constructed a new prospective block, which would be basically throwing money away, so they do this instead. This block was mined just 19s after the previous one. Similarly block 390,806 was mined in 7s and also contained just 1 tx.

If you use a bank, they could go insolvent and your coins vanish like in a mtgox episode. This is still the better option if you want a relatively non technical, hands off experience. With 2FA risk of theft is low.
If you use your own wallet, you have to be very security concious. For anything significant, get a hardware wallet, or at least a paper wallet. I own a Trezor and it works great and provides peace of mind. You don't have to be super technical for this, but more so than just using a website like Coinbase.

I think it comes down to engineering principles. At the very core of any complex system, you want something well tested, stable, and as simple as possible. Some analogies that come to mind would be TCP/IP for networking and the Linux kernel.
Both of these standards intend to change as little as possible, and yet incredible work has been done by building application layers on top of the existing infrastructure.
Core developers see the blockchain in the same way, in that it is stable and well-tested, and ready to be solidified. Bloating the blockchain with a size increase only kicks the can down the road and starts to set a dangerous precedent.
See the Fundamental theorem of software engineering:
We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection.

Big problem with this is exploits. I looked at playing FIFA for real money at one point but decided against it cause I heard it was mostly people scamming / exploiting and the arbitration system was sorely lacking.
These games are not really designed to be hardened, because it is a lot more expensive to do so. That's why things like aimbots and wall hacks are unfortunately rather widespread. If you were to add a financial incentive to this sort of activity, hackers would find even sneakier and treacherous ways to exploit the system.
I agree it would add a really interesting component to online gaming though. Could be a serious business if someone works on it. Check out  where I heard you can play an SNES bomberman clone for real BTC.

Hi Architect, Glad you found our platform interesting :)
Sorry about the rough edges, but really appreciate the feedback! I've gone ahead and manually deleted your contract, so you should be able to create a new one now.
The duration is bound by the contest end date, Jan 12 at 23:59 GMT, sorry we forgot to fix the UI to make this clear to the user. So for reference this gives you a max of about 24.2 days as of this moment.
We'll push an update later today with at least a quick fix to the UI regarding the max duration, and also we'll disable the reject button. The reason we disallow rejects is that otherwise, the user effectively gets a 15 minutes option on the strike price, which would be pretty easy to abuse.

If you aren't familiar with Hedgy, we are building a platform for smart contracts in the financial sector. Our first offering is a vanilla Bitcoin Forward that uses 2/3 multi-sig for posting collateral. Our goal is to help marketplace participants address price volatility and exchange/counter-party risk.
In anticipation of our live product launch, we are hosting a [Trading Challenge]( to gather feedback, grow our userbase, and familiarize the community with our offering. All contracts created for this purpose use a demo coin (BCY) which has no real value.
Prizes of $600, $400, and $200 will be awarded to the top 3 contracts on **both** the buy-side and sell-side. Six prizes in all for a total of $2400. Prizes will be awarded in BTC, with the conversion computed using Tradeblock's 2-hour TWAP the moment the challenge ends.
Entries and Scoring
For each entry, you only need to choose a direction (long/short), and a contract duration. The forward price is always set to the current XBX spot upon creation.
Each entry's score is computed using the ratio [Forward Price / Settlement Price]. For settlement price, we use the 2-hour TWAP at maturity.
[Get Started!](
Additional Entries
Each user is given only one entry by default, but you may earn up to three additional entries by completing any of the following tasks (+1 entry per task):
* Use the Invite Friends button on the dashboard to send out your referral link. Get three friends to register and unlock this entry.
* If any *one* of your referred friends completes KYC then unlock this entry.
* Complete full verification (KYC) yourself
**Note**: The P/L of your entries is not cumulative -- they are each given an independent rank on the leaderboard.
The only information you need to provide to enter is a valid email and working phone number. *But* you must fully verify before accepting any prize. You can wait to complete verification until the contest is over, as long as you are confident you will pass KYC checks.
Any attempts to circumvent the rules may result in a disqualification at the sole discretion of Hedgy. This includes, but is not limited to, creating more than one account, attempting to exploit our system, and any other malicious actions.
This post is a summary of the [Full Rules]( provided for convenience only, and holds no enforcement power in the Trading Challenge.

Lots of printers have a hidden internal storage that, while small, may still retain some printed documents for a surprisingly long period of time.
Combine that with the fact that most consumer grade printers were not built with security in mind (at all), and you really have a recipe for disaster.

I definitely understand your frustration. And while it probably seems like their compliance dept. is overly paranoid and intrusive, that *is* basically their job.
For similar reasons as you, I use Coinbase almost exclusively to acquire, then immediately transfer to a wallet I own, and almost never use them to sell.
Your anger would be more accurately directed at the bureaucrats, political institutions, establishment parties, etc that promote the bullshit legislation that leads to this sort of thing.

That is understandable. I also like to avoid filling out KYC info when possible.
But to be fair, that is only to unlock an extra entry. You can still enter and unlock 3/4 entries without completing KYC.

All you should need is your secret words, and passphrase, if you used one.
A likely mistake is that you are entering your password when being asked for passphrase. Your password is used to encrypt your seed file locally, whereas the passphrase is used as an additional input alongside your secret words to generate your private master key / seed. To clarify, multibit will prompt for your password on every transaction, but your passphrase is only entered when setting up the wallet. It is likely that you did not use a passphrase at all when setting up your wallet -- in which case just leave that blank when doing the restore.
Hope this helps!

The second amendment focuses specifically on a Militia. That's why many of us do not think the gov't has any right to restrict certain heavy weapons, stockpiling ammo, or body armor. A functional militia is the last line of defense against a number of different attack types, both internal and external.

Depends what you mean by mass adoption. As a store of value, being used to circumvent currency controls and currency debasement, it is absolutely ready for mass adoption. It is already used for this purpose in places that are restricting FX actions, like China and Argentina.
As a payment channel, competing with PayPal and the likes; Bitcoin is nowhere near supporting that sort of volume. Even if any of the blocksize BIPS actually took effect, we are still in a completely different ballpark in terms of throughput. This isn't a bad thing -- it is just a consequence of architecture. Compared to a distributed, trustless ledger, maintaining a private record database sounds almost trivial. Give it a couple years and payment channels will mature and perhaps then we will see an order of magnitude increase in traffic.


I don't really think Bitcoin will have that much impact on this particular phenomenon. Banks will continue to do what they do, namely overcharge and interest rate gouge. They will do the same crap with Bitcoin if they can get away with it (to some extent they can, to some extent they can't).
One thing I do believe, though, is that we are in the middle of the greatest wealth redistribution event in modern history. Most people aren't even paying attention. Those that are have a unique opportunity to really climb that ladder. But this won't necessarily have a significant impact upon the social strata. It *might* have a

Every year fiat loses about 2-3% of its purchasing power, due to new issuance. So it doesn’t fluctuate wildly, but it slowly and steadily loses. 
As people become more aware of this fact, and the ease with which they can avoid it, it will start an avalanche effect. Here’s a history of Rome’s financial collapse which has some interesting and compelling parallels to today, specifically the acceleration with which the currency was debased.

Depends on your intention. If you want to safely safeguard wealth over many years, yes, stack gold and silver. If you want to speculate that bitcoin will become the equivalent of gold for the digital realm, acquire bitcoin and you’ll be rewarded handsomely if correct, but most likely lose it all if wrong.
The prudent thing for most people to do is acquire some of both.

Nothing prevents banks from arising that operate on bitcoin, just as banks used to take gold deposits. For lending to really work we’d need the price to stabilize though. Until then there’s already a few companies providing loans collateralized by bitcoin and also a p2p lending platform built on Ethereum.

The point of bitcoin, the true novelty, is scarcity in the digital realm where before there was none. Bitcoin is effectively digital gold. So your example in the past regarding gold could apply in the digital realm as well. Except it would be a lot more transparent, banks could prove how much they had in reserve and you could see how many IOUs they have issued.
Also, as an improvement upon the current system, if you simply want to store funds with minimal risk, you can just hold your own crypto. If you try and do this with fiat every year you have a bit less purchasing power — punishing those who save, and discouraging it. Not to mention the inevitability that one day these pretty pieces of paper will no longer be worth anything.

Big problem is that most consumer transactions time out in 15 minutes, but there is no guarantee that they will publish your transaction within 15 minutes. But they will publish it later after your invoice expires. Not often, but maybe like 1% of the time. Not to mention you have no privacy and no actual ownership storing coins there.

I don't think the service should mandate that your TX must be mined within an hour. More likely they want to see it on network with a reasonable fee.

Here's the thing.. Comments like that make it harder and less desirable for women to participate. A joke delivered in poor taste could discourage some women from attending in the future.

Hi John, Does Coinbase ever plan on having adequate customer service so that users do not have to post to reddit when they cannot get a response from your support email?
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:51:56
If a banker prints more money, but no one spends it, does it still make a sound?
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:21:44
It's not willful bad action, it's more akin to negligence -- not paying enough attention to their customer service department.


So many times I have seen people posting about waiting 3 days or more for something, and within hours of a reddit post they get addressed.
It's like they are willing to put on a show that they are very responsive in public but are unwilling to actually fix their customer service department so there isn't a 2-3 day waiting queue.

A minority hashrate fork is always a hard fork. The way a soft fork works is the majority hashrate orphans blocks from non participating miners. If you are the minority you can't do that.
Your second statement is correct, I agree with that, but it doesn't change the technical details.
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:56:52
You aren't wrong, but that doesn't make it a bad investment. The highest returns are often found where there is the most unknowns and highest volatility.
Diversification is the key, and if you need access to spending cash soon you shouldn't invest in anything but the most stable instruments.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:23:22
The issue is propagation time, as you clearly know. You're claiming that the entire network starts mining on top of any valid block header it receives, and since the propagation time of the header is very low it's not an issue if blocks get larger. Seems to make sense to me.
But let's say blocks get very large, and it takes much longer than 30s - 2min to download and verify a block. It could start to become worth it to engage in antagonistic behavior and what not.

Your statement isn't wrong, but I don't see how it applies to the fact that larger blocks have higher orphan risk.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:18:41
The fee is not proportional to the value transacted but the actual size in bytes. All values are represented in the same data type so amount transacted has no effect. Typical transactions will be 200-500 bytes, but joining many inputs will make larger ones.
You shouldn't have to worry about that stuff though, a good wallet would take care of that, and looking up the current fee market. For now you can prolly just set it to .0003 and move on.

@_date: 2016-01-12 17:26:05
I was thinking about this a few weeks ago. But first let me say, I believe you are wrong in your intro


Bitcoin allows the crowd to take over  lending in a p2p manner. And they would receive a fair market rate instead of the 0% for lending to the big banks today.
Now, to your point, I think there would be advantages to having some centralization in this system. Most people do not want to research a debtor's history, and likelihood to repay. And there are also benefits to spreading your risk over many investments. 
I think at some point we will see the emergence of 'bitcoin investment banks'. They will probably operate using a token or sidechain to denote stake. Basically it would start out with the bank raising some # BTC and issuing some # BIBcoin. If everything is going smoothly, BIBcoin would rise steadily. But if defaults came in, or there was theft at the bank, the BIBcoin price would drop. Since it could be traded on the open market there would be no notion of insolvency. If the BIB does a bad job your investment is just worth less.
We are a long way from this today. Hesitancy from community to give their BTC to someone else for investment would be serious. Also, lending BTC out may generate less returns than just hodling. This won't really be a viable idea until the space matures drastically.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:06:40
It's actually a bit different in Bitcoin land because the difficulty retarget is ca. every 2 weeks. In Ethereum the minority chain was able to survive because the difficulty adjusted very quickly.
@_date: 2016-03-08 19:57:34
This is very cool! It is perfect you found a way to do it without needing to install machines. 2% over spot is truly industry leading. Although I must question how consistent that is as a few minutes ago it said 5% o_O

He said that Satoshi set up a bank of 50 computers in the early days to maintain full control over the network, so that he could iterate more easily. This allowed him to push any changes that caused hard-forks without having to fight against the network.

The ETH/ETC precedent? That is a way different case because the difficulty retarget is waaaay faster. Even in a 70/30 split, the 30 are likely to switch over rather than wait 6 weeks for a retarget.

This was when using their payment system similar to BitPay, correct? (just curious)
@_date: 2016-01-30 00:40:25
Just FYI Coinbase does not provide any timing guarantee when you request a payment from them. Which can be problematic when Bitpay invoices expire after 15 minutes.
I actually ran into this issue the other day trying to fulfill an invoice using Coinbase, when they did not submit the transaction to the network for about an hour. The invoice did not report to the merchant and I could not get any help from them. I'm lucky Coinbase refunded me (it was only .046 BTC) but they made it clear this was not standard practice going forward! I doubt they would be nearly as accommodating for expensive electronics xD

Your reason regarding wanting to be trade quickly is a non issue on Gemini -- They recently added 0-conf trading for BTC deposits. All exchanges have risk of a hack, i guess you have to ask yourself which is more likely, you mess up / get hacked, or they do. They are a bigger target so more eyes but better OpSec cause they are a business. Your best bet is probably to keep some under a private key you control and some with them, diversifying the risk. Though if you are 100% comfortable with your own keys no reason to keep on exchange.

That's a serious coordination problem. You'd need to get all the exchanges on that chain to upgrade or they'd see the new fork as invalid blocks. Now you end up with 3 chains.
If they are ready for it to happen it's feasible, otherwise I think complications abound and in the interim miners will abandon ship in favor of the less complicated longest-chain.

Empty blocks still build confirmations, it's actually a positive for the network. Certain applications wait for 3/6 confirmations so it helps speed those along.

But honestly I'd suggest accept the volatility aspect. Volatility implies large risk but also large possible reward.

Both networks were still in their infancy at the time of the exploit (circa 2 years old). That said, there are key differences. Ethereum has benefited significantly from the success of bitcoin in terms of gaining attention and value.

$500 daily ACH deposit limit is for their own protection, because ACH transfers are easily reversed. Verification process is thanks to the USSA (though i've heard wait times have been very high recently).

The power is in your hands to make segwit2X a non-contentious fork, in which case this is a moot point. Also considering the BitPay statement, it seems dangerous to assume that sw2x will not be able to buy a cup of coffee. Oh and also you cannot buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin today, unless you want to pay a fee greater than the cost of the coffee.


No.. sw2x is a *compromise* proposal. It was, we'll give you this if you give us that. There is no demonstrable "we control Bitcoin" on either side if sw2x is not contentious.

Technically they are incentivized to mine the most profitable coin, but this is not always cut and dry because coins are not spendable for 100 blocks after minting and then have to be transferred to an exchange and sold. So for coins that are extremely volatile it's hard to quantify without either incorporating some risk factor or entering a forward contract with a large buyer.

Company's don't keep a ledger of who owns shares, or if they do it's not authoritative. DTCC owns all shares and issues promises or obligations to member broker-dealers. They in turn do the same to smaller brokers, and again, and again, until finally reaching the retail investor. 
So at the end of the day what you actually have claim to is a chain of obligations. This lets the broker dealers do all sorts of nefarious things, if they were so inclined, and can also wreck havoc on one's investments if their broker, or their broker's broker has troubles.
There's a great video Byrne did on this I can find if you want to watch.

Many want a blocksize increase before segwit or 2nd layer solutions, but it is not true to say many people have problems with segwit &amp; LN. I think the average person involved in Bitcoin wants both, the only disagreement is which order to do them in.

I didn't say they were talking about using the bitcoin blockchain. You can make tokens easily on ethereum. R3 is already [testing out these waters](
There are only 2 parties to a typical Bitcoin transaction. What is the distinction I'm missing? If there are a few dozen brokers/banks on a private ethereum chain, one of them mines it. Maybe it is one of the parties to the transaction, more likely not. This is not dissimilar to the public chain.
I don't think it is legally required, it is just the customary way things are done now. Check out [this video]( by Patrick Byrne. He explains the current system really well, and the historical motivation of that system.
To issue shares in another way you do need regulatory approval. Byrne's T0 has already [been approved](

Since he is a stock broker, you should be able to sell him on how the blockchain will revolutionize parts of his industry. The most interesting application is in settlement. You can tell him this is no longer a speculative use case, it is actually a developing use case. The DTCC can eventually be replaced by the ethereum network.
t0 has already issued a bond using blockchain ([link]( and also has SEC approval to issue shares via blockchain ([link](
Nasdaq settled their first trade using blockchain earlier this year. ([link](

Since he is in the industry, he should know that the financial system is showing huge signs of stress. Hedge funds gating, various CDS of eu banks blowing out..

To me, one of the major innovations from Bitcoin is that it provides true, unalterable proof of ownership. When you store your coins with Coinbase their internal database decides proof of ownership. This is an undesirable form of centralization and a single point of failure.
Have you considered using the Coinbase vault at all? That is an interesting product that allows you to retain true ownership while still getting their added benefits of security.
What about a hardware wallet? I agree keeping any significant stash using any other method is dangerous, but hardware wallets insulate your private keys very effectively.
Also you should be aware Coinbase does not provide any sort of service guarantee. If you are trying to pay a clocked invoice, or for something IRL, their may be a service interruption that means your transaction will not be pushed to network for some time. This happened to me the other day. Coinbase graciously refunded me (it was only $20), BUT they made it clear for the future they would not provide this refund in the future. Which to me makes it unusable as a day-to-day wallet.
The better analogy IMO is that Coinbase is a walled-garden like AOL. You effectively need their permission to send funds, they can restrict your outbound and inbound without your consent. The open Internet is then comparable to the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, and the true game changer (Google) is hardware wallets.

Some banks do have a problem with Bitcoin related transactions. Depends on the country, jurisdiction, and that particular bank. Best if the origination source isn't obviously a Bitcoin exchange.

I am expecting a major correction coming soon, but also.. none of us want to convert back to fiat, for the most part. Which makes the gains somewhat stable.

Yeaaaa honestly their customer service times have been so long in other instances too though. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:42:09
That's not necessarily true. I submitted a TX right before the most recent difficulty adjustment, with a fee estimating 1-3 blocks for confirmation. But my timing was very unlucky and after the adjustment the fee market moved dramatically, and my TX did not confirm for a couple days.
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:06:26
Yeaaaa I know.. I mean it seems like a correction is inevitable after such a large rise, but also if that's the case why hasn't it happened yet..
Basically i have no idea what is going to happen. I do think flat or down is more likely than up at this point though.

They don't oppose SegWit, they just think a standard block size increase is important as well. And they feel slighted that the core devs broke the HK agreement.

This is a great solution if you can't afford a hardware wallet, but once you have more than 1 or 2 it's worth it for the additional security.

@_date: 2017-04-06 22:39:21
It is not an *immediate* boost. The extra blocksize is only suitable for segwit UTXOs, all legacy UTXOs still have to put their witness data in the main block.

The user experience is broken by the wallet software, not the Bitcoin network. There will always be a fee market, even with Bitcoin Unlimited. A good wallet should warn a user before sending a transaction with inadequate fee.
Using Coinbase as a custodian for most of my coins is anti-thetical to the true values of Bitcoin, IMO.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:12:51
Coinbase and circle are like the Bitcoin equivalent of PayPal. Honestly I don't think they would get that much traction adding bitcoin, but I guess even a little traction would be large numbers for Bitcoin.

Yes, but if the market moves against their peg then they eventually run out of reserves.

Hours a block? It would be average 40 minutes. Depending on what the market is pricing each chain, along with politics, would affect the miner's decisions. There is no guarantee from game theory.
There is also the meta-game, maybe a large pool faux switches to classic and then reverts after fork.
Not saying it's likely, but you can't discount the possibilities.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:11:54
Check out Coinbase's vault offering for full custody but additional ease of use and security. Make sure you look at the *multi-sig* vault. They only have 1/3 keys so it's truly your funds.
And like others have said, GET A HARDWARE WALLET! Seriously if you have &gt;1 BTC it is worth it. I love my Trezor.
Don't give anyone full custody of coins. (Coinbase account, exchange account etc.)

Damn I have a good paying job but 28 BTC in 3 weeks is hella impressive.
I would recommend using a Trezor or other hardware wallet for cold storage though, way more secure than a paper wallet, and well well worth the investment if you have that many BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:31:58
Why are you doing fee calculations manually? The wallet should be doing those for you, considering you probably don't know the TX size before sending.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:33:32

Basically you just make a token for each share, having the private key to spend that token is proof you own the share. Once the send has been mined your trade has settled.

A rational miner might submit TXs to the unupgraded miners spending the ANYONE_CAN_SPEND opcodes, the unupgraded miner would accept those TXs as valid but the block would not be valid by upgraded nodes, causing the miner's blocks to get orphaned assuming majority support for the seg wit fork.

If you hold coins personally and there is a fork, you have coins on both chains. If you have a Coinbase IOU, and they decide to go with only one fork, you don't get coins on both chains.

I don't understand why more wallets haven't gotten on top of this problem (1). It is relatively simple to make a REST call and tell the user current fee levels and then ask which lane they want for this transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:14:46
The Fed can print USD, but not BTC. Which means they could set an artificial price floor by taking any BTC on offer &lt;= $1024 (financed with printed money).
But they cannot set a price ceiling, because that requires being able to print BTC. Currency pegs can generally be maintained (to a degree), but they require periodic shifting according to market forces or the peg federation will go bust.

Purchases made back in 2011-2012 have effectively 0 cost basis. Although it should lower your *Fair Share*^TM obligation, reporting a 0 cost basis will likely not affect you significantly. Another thing to note, be careful wiring large amounts of money to the bank from a Bitcoin exchange. You may wish to talk to them ahead of time and they can segregate your *Fair Share*^TM withholdings, this might lessen the risk of it all getting seized.
Disclaimer: Just some random dude on the Internet, I know next-to-nothing about this stuff. You're talking 7 figures as per your other comment, I would def pony up and get a lawyer and accountant before moving forward. Hell you might even want to incorporate as small trading business. I dunno.

I don't really think that is accurate. A proper bitcoin wallet cannot 'go down' imo. The other day I was trying to use my Coinbase account to pay for something in person, but they did not submit the transaction for about an hour because their hot wallet was down (or something).
After corresponding with them they made it clear that it is unsafe to send funds from Coinbase to an address outside of your control. Unless it is a long-lived depository address at another service. But not suitable for payments IRL or on bitpay (15 minute timeout on invoice). They will not in general refund payments issued just because their hot wallet was down for hour or two.
I think the better analogy is that Coinbase is a bank. And if their service is up (which is &gt;99% probably), you can transfer funds.

I only joined the team a few months ago, so I might not have all the backhistory. But I think the decision not to use Bitcoin mostly relates to regulatory compliance (yuck). It's much, much easier to get through the SEC in a tightly controlled system. Another complication with using Bitcoin is since blocks don't close rapidly, it's harder to claim the trade is the settlement. Capacity is definitely a concern as well; if we are to attract traditional Wall St players they balk at the mention of 7 tx/sec (which isn't even a good measure of open capacity, obv).
That said, most of the team members appreciate the importance of using a public chain and hope to do something in that realm in the future.

This doesn't make sense to me, because it is bad practice to let someone else have custody of your funds long term regardless of method of acquisition.
Sidenote, Gemini does not charge a tx fee on withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-09-08 19:39:54
I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers. If you do full KYC you can easily get on an exchange with 0.25% taker fee.
If you don't want to KYC, you can acquire coins through an ATM or localbitcoins and remain pseudonymous.

Auction indications are published starting 10 minutes prior to settlement, so yes it is very likely bots are watching these and looking for arbitrage opportunities. Don't really see anything wrong with that; especially since it can't be back-and-forth wash trading like on some other exchanges.
Regarding the volume spike, their stated purpose was to have a high liquidity event for people looking to make large trades without leaking information into the market. So I think that maybe makes sense. It is a big spike though.
@_date: 2016-09-22 06:47:51
Their press release said that they expect the auction process to support larger liquidity for big trades. I don't entirely see what but I imagine they have their reasons.
@_date: 2016-09-24 06:51:02
Don't worry, they'll charge you twice randomly at some point in the future and it will all even out. kek.
@_date: 2016-09-29 01:48:28
I'm pretty sure you're wrong. First off, Base58Check is not a hash function, it is an encoding. An address is computed using the hash `RIPEMD160(SHA256(PUB_KEY))`, and then encoded using Base58Check for presentation to the user.
If the checksum was done on the pubKey before the hash, there would be no way for an application to verify the checksum, because it was hashed.
Check out the first few pages of chapter 4 in Mastering Bitcoin.
You are right that the OP's premise is flawed, as it is impossible to change just a single character without changing the checksum (which is substantial, about 17 digits in Base58)
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:58:47
Just want to point out to you that stories like this is why I don't use Coinbase anymore, and why I won't use GDAX either. It's one thing to have to comply with regulations, but your support is seriously lacking.

I understand how Bitcoin works. What remains to be seen is the lengths governments will go to exert control.
When FinCen declares it illegal for miners to process transactions involving OFAC blacklisted addresses (and this will include building ontop of blocks that include said addresses), there will be a contentious fork (unless &gt;51% of hashrate is compliant).
I want to see Bitcoin succeed as much as anyone here but ignorance against future events will just find us blindsided where we should be prepared.

My best recommendation would simply be diversify. Screw dealing with exchanges and paying the carry cost of futures and stuff, that will eat away at your nest egg faster than fiat inflation.
Get equal parts of gold, silver, bitcoin, and altcoins. That way you get some stability (metals) and some breakout upside (crypto).

I don't think it's up to the operator to set the price of an ETF. The mechanism by which a typical ETF matches the physical object is by offering conversion; send them 1 BTC get 10 COIN; burn 10 COIN get 1 BTC. This allows arbitrageurs to make a little profit whenever the price goes out of whack. (GBTC is non-convertible which is why the price is cray cray)

The main innovation in Bitcoin is the consensus mechanism (proof of work) which solves the double spend problem. Satoshi combined this with known methods of encryption and hashing to build the Bitcoin protocol.
You keep saying 'glorified public database' as though that is some triviality. A decentralized database with no central authority and a consensus mechanism doesn't need to be 'glorified', that itself is a significant leap. 
You can argue philosophically about whether or not that is an important problem to solve, and if Bitcoin has properties that make it good money, but you can't really dispute the technical achievement.

LN could affect fungibility, if there are only a handful of hubs to make a payment to store X, they could be incentivized/coerced to censor certain addresses. If the cost of opening a new channel to an uncorrupted hub is significantly high that makes those coins less fungible.

That also works, but if you do that you need to make sure to have a safe backup, which is basically the same thing as a paper wallet. And you potentially leave yourself open to getting hacked.

Elevator Pitch
In the same way that the Internet dramatically transformed communications networks, and eventually every single aspect of our lives; Bitcoin (the blockchain) will (in fact, has already begun) radically transforming financial networks (and eventually every single aspect of our lives).
Space Elevator Pitch
a) Smart Contracts -- The OTC market is absolutely gigantors ($700 Trillion). The blockchain will revolutionize this market over the next few years. Collateral kept in escrow is locked by a multi-sig wallet and provides proof of solvency. Counter parties can still settle directly, and only if one of them is incorrigible does a trusted third-party need to step in. This reduces friction and eliminates the need to trust a third party collateral manager. The solvency of Lehman and Bear Sterns during the last financial crisis was due in large part to over leverage on CDS - a form of OTC derivative.
2) End the Fed -- The way banking works today will soon (hopefully) become a thing of the past. The justification for the Fed is to provide a lender of last resort. Bitcoin eliminates the propensity for fractional reserve banking, and thus eliminates the justification for that relic of an institution. Banking will truly be segregated between custodial, which charge a fee for a service (think Coinbase), and investment, which offer modest interest payments by amortizing risk (similar to a CD in traditional banking). The latter will hopefully be dominated by p2p matching services.
d) Contracts and Deeds -- Birth certificates, company shares, the deed to your house, and business contracts will all be recorded on the blockchain and provably signed by your private key. This will simplify transference of these assets, reduce the burden on government for record keeping, and continue to effect us in ways we could never predict.
Welcome to the Moon!

That is not the way HFT works conceptually. There are definitely bad actors out there, a la ITG, front running their own clients under the guise of HFT, and others violating exchange rules (like naked short selling). These firms give the industry a bad rap. But if we are talking about the concept of HFT, it is not inherently bad.


This is not how most (all?) major exchanges work. The matching engine provides an atomic event when you are removing liquidity. It is the market participant's option to either remove all the liquidity they need in a single order, or to split it up. In the former case, the price does not change, and in the latter they made the calculated choice to leak information about sell/buy pressure.
In the case where they need to a lift liquidity from a number of different exchanges simultaneously, they use an inter-market sweep order which provides a facsimile of atomicity.
HFTs are mostly an artificial scapegoat for the rest of the financial industry. They don't even really make that much $$, like you would think (the competition is pretty steep, as points out)

I think it already did. This auction could have been a significant catalyst for the recent volatility. The auction participants are a limited pool so it would not be surprising if the auction prints below-spot. If that is the case, auction participants would have incentive to sell off just before the auction, especially considering the recent run-up.
If the auction prints above spot, they can return to the market to (do their best) to cover loss. Since the auction price is not made public, it wouldn't necessarily have impact on the spot price right away.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:46:21
I guess.. Thing is, empty blocks are typically found very very quickly. Cause they are the easiest / most obvious ones to check first.
The cost is how much time was wasted with no productive mining. Most empty blocks are found within 10 second - 1 minute. Not a ton of throw away time.
The only option I see to address this would be to add a min block size. But I'm sure many would argue that has the potential to harm the network even worse.
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:02:02
It will increase the float, so my guess would be a bearish impact. BUT.. This event is well known ahead of time so the market should have priced it in already. But that basically contradicts observable evidence, so I dno what to think anymore.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:45:58
If there were not a block size limit, miners would be incentivized to include as many transactions as possible in each block (except those tx without miner tips). This is because the marginal work to include a tx is basically zero.
**But**, block size bloat has a negative impact on the system as a whole. Including but not limited to: a) fewer full nodes running, b) takes longer to download the full blockchain, c) propagation of a new block is slower, possibly more soft forks, and many others.
This is well known problem in macroeconomics known as Negative Externalities.

So just because a citizen is working abroad and needs to send money back home, that makes him/her dumb?

They would outlaw exchanging BTC for fiat, and outlaw exchanging BTC for goods. This would be in close coordination with a propaganda campaign associating BTC with tax evasion, criminal enterprise, and terrorism. Well I guess they are already started that part.
I think Russia already did the first part, too.

What keeps getting published is articles about capital controls (specifically, moving cash out of the country). No official barriers to entry into or out of BTC right now, but since the Chinese gov't cracked down on the Macau workaround the citizens are flocking to BTC as an alternative. Many believe it is only a matter of time until they try and restrict BTC as well. If they leave BTC unregulated, they will lose all control over currency outflows.

Most of the limitations are the fault of regulations / traditional banking / gov't, not Coinbase.

Also, even though the deposit of BTC from Coinbase takes a while, your price is locked in when you place the order.

Dates of previous auctions:
June 2014,
December 2014,
5 March 2015
December 2014 through January was absolutely brutal for the exchange value of BTC. ~380-&gt;200
5 March was near a local peak, surrounding price was ~240, traded at 275 on 5 March, peaked at 295 on 11 March.
Could be that the market is reacting positively to the fact that these auctions are coming to a close. While there will be a bunch new coins out there in a few days looking for homes, if the rally holds some people will be more than happy to house them.

Just want to offer one clarification:
We are actually using 2 of 3 multi-sig (not 3 of 3). In the typical case, the two counter parties settle bilaterally after reviewing the proposed settlement. Only in the case where one of the parties loses their private key, or is being a bad loser, does Hedgy step in to complete the transaction.

Aside from the obvious political hurdles, I don't think it is possible by the definition of the SDR. It is technically a claim on the issuing banks to force them to print more fiat. Since there is no corollary in bitcoin, it doesn't really seem sensible.

PayPal is not equivalent in any sense to BTC. Your PayPal balance is in USD while a coinbase balance is regulated as a commodity (I think).
You can transfer BTC instantly, once you have them. Coinbase cannot give you immediate access because they would get scammed by people reversing or claiming fraud on the USD xfer. Coinbase would be out USD and BTC. They need to wait until the transaction is 'irrevocable'.
If you're primary interest is speculation / get rich quick, you would be better off at an exchange rather than a hosted wallet. There you can buy and sell quickly.

I am not but I imagine the suggestion would be something similar to tier structuring on modern equity exchanges, e.g. EDGX.
**Tiers** (Using totally made up numbers):
Bronze tier: Execute trades exceeding a total notional value of $10,000 over the last 30 days.
Silver tier: [..] $100,000
Gold tier: [..] $1,000,000
Market Maker tier: In addition to qualifying for Gold tier, the average notional value of user's open orders on the book over the last 30 days exceeds $50,000. Only count orders on the first 3 levels of the book (or something like that).
Tiers could be calculated on a rolling basis, at 0:00 UTC or something like that.
**Fee schedule** (maker/taker):
Bronze tier: 0%/0.24%
Silver tier: 0%/0.21%
Gold tier: -0.01%/0.20%
Market Maker tier: -0.05%/0.20%
You could get push back from the community if you provide rebates to market makers. But it is a common industry practice to build larger depth.

Daily volume numbers are rumored / certain to be wildly inaccurate thanks to 0-fee exchanges. Also, even if we had sane volume numbers you can't simply say 44k is a fraction of that volume, because the auction is applying huge uni-directional pressure.

There are many tumbler services to get around the problem of traceability, if that is an issue to you. But AFAIK, no coins have ever been blacklisted and there is no reason to think that all exchanges would, in a coordinated fashion, agree to blacklist certain addresses.
That's not to say it is completely unthinkable in the future. But I am more concerned about the government trying to shutter the BTC &lt;=&gt; Fiat window altogether.
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:43:51
Actually it wouldn't. For about 10-30 seconds after a new block is found, SPV miners have a choice. They can keep mining on the previous block and hope to publish a competing block, or they can idle while their master node validates the new block and gives out instructions. Since neither of those options is desirable, they mine an empty block because that takes very little time to set up.
My understanding of this is a bit limited but I had the same question as you some time ago.

This is a great question and possibly very relevant in the near future for a lot of hodlers. What you are going to want to do is sell some portion of your coins (not all of them) and then enter into a forwards contract for the amount you sold. You should be able to find a market with a small-ish premium to spot. You will need to put up some of your unsold coins as collateral (typically ~30%).
If you have recovered the fiat before the contract matures, you can take delivery of your BTC at near your original price. If you are unable to repay the fiat, you can close out your forward position by taking an opposite trade or net-settling with your counterparty. This will result in a trade balance that is nearly equivalent to having held, but you will be holding a mixed bag instead of pure BTC.

The pipe dream is that some elites keep a majority of their assets in USD, US Treasuries, and related instruments. If bitcoin replaces USD as global reserve currency then their net worth shrinks dramatically.

This is not front-running, whoever removed the liquidity on the second exchange does not know if there is another order coming in or not.
Let's say you have an order to sell 1 BTC @ 325 on the book at both Coinbase and Gemini. Then you get notified that the Coinbase order was filled, and take a second look at all the exchanges and realize your existing order is now under priced. So you cancel your order at Gemini and re-submit @ 326.
Have you done something wrong?
This is a natural, unavoidable consequence of distributed markets. There is a whole segment of the industry working on related software, it's called Smart Order Routing.
This sort of activity has zero impact on the retail investor (your broker is using smart order routing to fill orders, and most of your orders are small enough to get filled at a single market anyways).
I do think some reforms should be made to HFT though, mostly to address phantom liquidity. Orders should have to stay on the book for a minimum amount of time and perhaps cancellations should be throttled at the port level. This would probably reduce liquidity a bit in calm waters but would increase liquidity during a volatility event.

I use Trezor on my mac through the official web wallet (wallet.trezor.io), with no issues at all. At one point a year or two ago the web wallet was trash but they've really revamped it well. That said there is an element of privacy lost compared to a more full fledged software wallet, even SPV. If that's a concern I don't have any good answers for you, but I've seen Armory mentioned. Don't bother with MultiBit.
The other thing, you don't need to worry too heavily about physical security of your Trezor. It's designed so that a thief cannot extract the keys without a lot of work (arguably not possible at all?)

Communication between nodes is not currently encrypted. This would allow an eavesdropper to see what transaction you query about, what transactions you submit, stuff like that. With the communication channel encrypted it's no longer easy to eavesdrop. Mined transactions still become public though, of course.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. We are seeing a deflationary spiral start forming already. Lower commodity prices leads to massive loan defaults which leads to the global economy grinding to a halt. The current system is reliant on pumping out new loans to keep inflation going.
I don't think a deflationary spiral situation applies to sound money like bitcoin or gold, though.

The major issues preventing widespread use of bitcoin are ease of use, number of supportable transactions, and entrenchment of existing currencies.
It is helpful to not view bitcoin as a competitor to fiat currencies (not yet anyways). The larger application is smart contracts. These will be used to simplify escrow, provide provable collateral without a trusted third party, and simplify a whole manner of financial transactions and instruments.
Some people may say bitcoin is not ideal because it is deflationary. Or because it inhibits the government's ability to provide counter-cyclical Keynesian stimulus. Or that because we can't grow the monetary base to match the size of the economy it will lead us into a deflationary spiral. These people are well meaning but typically lack the ability or desire to think for themselves. In my experience.

Once the channel is confirmed open those coins cannot be sent to anyone else (they are locked in a P2SH).
Also, I don't think using LN makes sense in this instance.. AFAIK you cannot open a channel without non-channel confirmed coins, so the recipient wouldn't be able to do anything. Couldn't even send back to the seller b/c the channel is one-way.

Submit the transaction for coffee with a low fee, then submit a transaction spending the same output with a high fee (but paying to your address). Most (all?) wallets aren't going to help you double spend so you would probably have to craft the TX somewhat manually. I imagine there are developer tools out there for that, or you could always just use the command line.
It wouldn't be worth it for a coffee. But I could see people doing it for bigger purchases like electronics and stuff. But for that size of transaction the receiver probably should wait at least for 1 confirm.

I don't think it's fair to say a startup currency has never existed, even going beyond those that has pointed out. At one point gold was a startup currency. In the early days of civilization barter was the rule. When someone had the brilliant idea to use something that was naturally scarce and didn't decay, I imagine his peers didn't line up to trade food and weapons for a shiny rock. Early adopters of gold, therefore, would have reaped huge benefits.
There are several examples, of course, where early adopters got punished. A couple examples: the Antoninianus (intended successor to the Denarii), the Continental ("not worth a continental"). Potential failure and loss is the nature of the game.
BTW, 100% agree that lady was really annoying. If you are going to provide the balanced viewpoint at least use a rational argument.

If you convert back to USD and deposit into a bank, you will get noticed/flagged. Prepare to pay taxes on capital gains, prepare to answer questions about where you got the money, prepare to be hounded by the Feds and possibly hit with civil asset forfeiture until you prove you acquired that money legitimately. If you do go this route use a full on exchange and not a retail service like Coinbase or Circle.
Doing $7000 a week is called structuring and will certainly summon the wrath of the tax man.
For a full recommendation, would need some more details about where you got said bitcoin. But in general, my recc. would be to keep it on the Bitcoin network and spend it as needed. You can buy things on Overstock, Expedia, Steam, Newegg, etc. Get a bitcoin-powered debit card to spend at places that do not accept bitcoin natively.

From what I see, the recent price movement has all been very strongly tied to current political events. The last run up to ~300 was based around the Greek crisis, and this one appears to be correlated with the escalation in Syria and/or the Glencore (et al) fears. Expect the price to keep climbing if the Syrian conflict escalates and/or the next solvency crisis explodes.

If Polo was using the same deposit address for both ETC and ETH, then they absolutely would have credited you for both, if Coinbase withdrawals were getting replayed on ETC.

Multiple bad experiences with their customer support. 1- actual delivery of BTC after promised date. 2- Limits randomly change for no apparent reason. 3- Issues with their payment gateway. 4- Overly invasive KYC for retail. 
Eventually I bit the bullet when realizing I would have to full-on KYC for the amounts I was buying, but figured it would be best to shop around. Very glad I went with Gemini at this point, ETH trading was a nice bonus to get :)

Those who work in finance are most acutely aware of the inefficiencies and dangers of the status quo. This makes perfect sense to me. This coming from someone who used to work on wall street but now works on bit street :)

Perhaps cause 300 has been bit of an upper bound lately, so people expect if we break through could be allot more upside.

The prices at OKCoin and BTCC are about the same, indicating it has more to do with CNY than withdrawl issues.

It's way more anarchic than leftist. Anti-establishment isn't necessarily pro-entitlement.

Hardware wallet if you have anything over 1 BTC.

That's a terrible analogy. Car salesperson has all sort of motives. People in a forum have motives too but mostly people looking to help.

2) Complementary, gold/silver is better than Bitcoin IRL. But Bitcoin is way better on the Internet.
2-A) I would hold majorly BTC, with some side bets in ETH, DASH, Monero, et al you think are interesting.

There is a technical / chartist theory of a 'triple bottom' indicating a price floor has been found and the start of a new bear run. So hopefully you are right!
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:53:11
Oh I see. Thanks for the clarification.

Don't PM anyone the details.. they will have little incentive not to just run off with your coins. For something like this, you really want a trusted party trying to crack it. What you reallllly want is to run the crack yourself.

You can exchange very easily on shapeshift or poloniex.

If you assume the supply and demand curves are straight lines with a +/-1 slope, then the price would double. Of course reality is much, much more complicated!

Hello Sir, this is the IRS. I see here that you owe us $1240 in back taxes. For technical reasons we can only accept ITunes gift cards at this time.

If 100% of customer's ETC is in cold storage, then who's ETC was getting sent during the replays?

I'd be happy to supply you a test address ;)

The age old test is to bite on a gold coin and it should give slightly. Cause it's a soft metal. Something like that.

This is one of many issues i've heard reported with Coinbase payment gateway. You'd think the largest (?) Bitcoin company in the US could get this working with less issues.
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:08:10
Have you tried moving the funds out of the vault or are you just viewing the balance?
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:01:25
That is highly impractical for an exchange running a hot wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:59:34
I would have faith they will eventually sort this out.. their customer service is just really lacking.
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:23:23
Once you hit 1 BTC you should get a hardware wallet, well worth the extra protection! Make sure you get one with a screen and buttons. (Trezor and Ledger Nano S are good options)

I accidentally sent a wire to their old bank before they switched to Silvergate, and they credited my account within the hour. Hope you find a speedy resolution.

What is the clause you put in? Like I will loan you $900 today and you will pay me back 2BTC worth of USD in the future?
@_date: 2016-05-10 17:32:29
If you are using Coinbase retail, then yes. Coinbase *exchange* is comparable to Kraken in rates, though.

Has nothing to do with hot vs. cold, it's an accounting error. User walks in with ETH, walk out with ETH + ETC. They are in the red for however much ETC was siphoned off in this way; or they can refuse to support ETC and not credit people with ETC tokens even if they held ETH at time of fork. In the latter case they actually own a bunch of ETC all of a sudden. So that's quite a red flag from a legal POV.
