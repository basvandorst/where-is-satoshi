Nice little project you have here. I considered using a front-facing LCD to display QR codes but that would still require customers to own a smartphone. I'm partial to NFC tags myself :)
Good luck with your project, I look forward to seeing how it is adapted.

Play this gif in reverse and you have my reaction.
I was hoping for a cheap stock up.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:26:26
Price is a little steep but be sure to let us know how it goes!
@_date: 2013-05-13 10:13:15
This I'll have to check out.
@_date: 2013-03-18 21:56:08
Haha, big ballin' over here.
Cheers mate

You charge for coffee at work? Yikes
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:10:18
Well the title was fairly misleading, this isn't anything like Square at all.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:58:02
Bitcoin is still very young, it is up to us early adopters to decide what and how we want to implement the technologies that will assist us with the new currency should it become a replacement.
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:47:32
It's only going up from here, any drops will not be substantial and if they are it's just going to go right back up as we saw last week. Think long term investment, not short.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:49:36
I agree, in order for that type of service to exist a compromise would need to be made somewhere.
I'm sure more users would opt for trusting a third party to store small amounts of bitcoin as opposed to storing personal information or slow processing times.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:31:01
ELeeMacFall provided a great response regarding monopoly. There's no reason a competing service can not arise, after all it's a free market :)
I would say that I don't think my approach is the greatest, but it is the best that I've come up with to adequately provide all the functionality I expect from this type of service.
Different approaches have their pros/cons, but in the end the idea I've laid out will maintain the anonymity, security and speed of bitcoin, which I think are the most important aspects when making a purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:47:14
You and me both buddy.
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:24:48
Give it a good test run first :P
@_date: 2013-03-14 06:08:53
And they're buying BTC at market price, no fees ;)
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:32:15
I'm working on a POS payment processor. The way I've planned to circumvent waiting on confirmations is by removing in-store transactions from the blockchain altogether.
This consists of having users deposit to a bitcoin address to load their accounts. The bitcoin are then held by the service until the user makes a purchase or withdraws them. When a purchase is made, the payment processor checks the user has sufficient funds then confirms the purchase. Meanwhile the purchase total is deducted from the users account and sent to the merchant from the service address keeping purchases anonymous.
This is a very simple explanation, but it gets the point across. Confirmation times are near-instant for purchases, and speed of bitcoin being paid to the merchant is dependent on transaction fees they are willing to incur.
If you want to know more I have a thread [here](

That was my face last night as it was going up to 53. Then again when I woke up and saw it at 55.
Love it.
Edit: 62? The fun just does not stop.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:23:53
Working on it :)
At the moment I'm waiting for some of the final parts to arrive, then I'll have a fully functional standalone prototype. 
I need to iron out everything that will make its way to the final product and lock down a price point for unit production, the website will follow shortly with registration for merchant and user interest.
I had plans for the project to focus solely on BTC, with options to convert price between USD to BTC to make it easier on the merchant inputting the sales total. But I have also considered allowing merchants to be paid directly in fiat, where the service will log and purchase any BTC from them at point of sale.
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:54:48
Right but it's not a bank. Just like people don't store their fortune on mtgox, they are not expected to load their accounts with any more than a day's spending.
Bitcoin are not physical, they can be but at the moment that is unnecessary and inconvenient. So there needs to be a physical way to purchase things with bitcoin and that is the aim of the service.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:08:03
Good start, you should increase the PPI so it comes out smoother when you print it out.
Our [old design]( looked a bit like that, you can see it in the top left.
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:06:45
Thanks, I appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:12:16
No worries, I'm located in California.
If this generates enough response, I would need to acquire some funding for secure server hosting at minimum. Beyond that, hardware production is simple as the components are cost-efficient enough to produce on demand. Producing in bulk could cut costs, and I've considered kickstarter for something like that.
As for launching the service, it would definitely go through a small field test somewhere like San Francisco. Then depending on how that goes, it'd slowly roll out to more cities, countries, etc.
Thanks for your offer, I'll send you a PM in a bit.
@_date: 2013-03-11 02:43:37
Ah sorry I didn't go through the process in very much detail. The user does not get a real bitcoin wallet.
When a user registers, they get a bitcoin address to make deposits into. Deposits to this address determine how much is credited to the user's account. It's worth noting that all deposits and withdrawals are free.
When a user makes a purchase, the total is deducted from their account balance provided they have sufficient funds. The purchase total is then sent to the wallet address supplied by the merchant.
There's no need to worry about propagation delay because purchases are confirmed at point of sale. The speed at which payment gets to the merchants wallet is based on the fees they are willing to incur. 
The service charges merchants a base transaction fee of 0.5% then covers the default 0.0005 BTC transaction fee when sending a customers bitcoin to their wallet. Any amount the merchant sets above 0.0005 BTC is taken from the deposit and included in the fee for miners.
I hope that cleared some things up. Thanks for the response!

Hello everyone I am happy to announce the [website]( is up and running as is [early registration](
We've got a preliminary design for the [bitcoin debit card](
I'll be taking any questions or comments here. Would love to hear what everyone thinks!
@_date: 2013-03-16 02:07:27
You tricky guy, I didn't even refresh the page but when I went back to the tab it says "re-enabled".
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:25:16
It bounced back stronger than ever despite the issue that was potentially serious.
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:02:07
Thank you very much. Once we have out an idea of where to start rolling devices out we'll be in touch.
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:52:59
I believe everyone else has failed as you put it because they are looking to work with the current front-end payment processors. I see that as the easy way out, it gets you the most compatibility to start but you still have to play by their rules.
What sets us apart is that we are developing our own merchant hardware. This gives us a much slower start, but we can build a loyal userbase around a superior service. Whether we succeed or fail, we can set the standard by which everyone else should follow.
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:40:11
I've been torn on this aspect. On the one hand I would love for the project to be open-source, but as security is of the utmost importance when it comes to real money, certain measures taken can not be made public.
@_date: 2013-03-16 01:57:43
It says that it is temporarily disabled.
Did you take it down or forget to put it back up?
@_date: 2013-03-12 07:30:29
Wow, so quick! I was expecting it to be a much tougher fix.
Great job to the devs.
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:32:15
Our debit cards use NFC. It's a wireless technology.
@_date: 2013-03-15 23:19:43
I think a lot of people are getting ahead of themselves and coming up with ideas that don't exactly work well with the Bitcoin protocol. 
Another user made a a point like: if someone is accepting Bitcoin on the premise it will be used in the real world, they are going to turn around and convert it to fiat anyways so why add an unnecessary step to the process.
You could argue that some people prefer to deal in bitcoin, or they don't generate USD by mining, but we're talking about a minority. It just doesn't make sense to include in a service like Kickstarter if accepting it is going to make their work more difficult.
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:31:23
Merchants will be provided with a a stack of pre-generated cards they can hand out as they please. You can definitely keep one for yourself.
Compatibility with current payment processors is being looked into but as you can imagine piggybacking on their services would require merchants to pay those same nominal fees even if we were to charge nothing.
Our goal is to provide a reasonably priced device that sets a low barrier of entry for anyone willing to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:49:17
Exactly. Having a quick and practical way to spend bitcoin at point of sale will help tremendously with adaptation.
Whether it's us or someone else, this is something we would like to see.
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:14:02
I feel like it would have been easier to use a calculator
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:24:31
Yes but SD owners stand to lose nothing where a bot written by an actual player would still have negative ROI.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:08:39
Oh boy, the competition is starting :P
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:26:59
He comes off like he doesn't know much about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:55:39
Isn't that essentially what credit/debit cards are? :)
I do hope it succeeds, because from what I've heard from merchants the current process for accepting digital money is an absolute mess. Thank you for your comments.
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:07:06
As I mentioned, security is very important. Anything that necessitates encryption gets it, and any risks inherent would be no more than using a debit/credit card.
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:02:38
Dude is a G, you have to give him that.
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:32:28
I don't think that bitcoin or the developers should have to cater to specific implementations on top of the protocol. It should really be the other way around.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:16:27
Interesting idea, I look forward to seeing your execution. May the best man win. ;)
@_date: 2013-03-10 23:43:59
Glad to hear :)
The great thing about NFC chips are that they come in many different form-factors. So beyond the stickers the service will provide, you can add your accounts public ID to certain [cell-phones]( keychains, wallet cards, and more.
@_date: 2013-03-11 00:00:59
The only transactions a user posts to the blockchain are deposits and withdrawals.
When a user makes a purchase, the total 0.25BTC (*for example*) is removed from their balance.
The **service** then creates a transaction with the **merchant** for 0.25BTC to the wallet address they provided.
This means all purchases are anonymous and can't be traced back to a user, only to the service itself.
@_date: 2013-03-10 23:27:03
Thanks, I appreciate it!
I feel QR codes would probably be more useful in exchanges between two people because you can store an entire wallet address and pay that person directly, no need for a payment processor.
In a medium to high volume business, having each customer scanning a QR can get tedious. The purpose of this service is to provide near-instant transactions, and NFC fits best in that sense.
But maybe I'll find a use for it in the future ;)
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:07:04
We just bite the bullet and hope the employees/customers appreciate it.
