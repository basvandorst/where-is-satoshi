Linux owns servers, but haven't they always? I can see the argument with smartphones now, but when Gates made that statement that wasn't even a projected revenue source was it?
Microsoft makes their money from their share of Windows on the desktop, which Linux hasn't touched, and from Office which as much as I like Libre, let's be honest - Office is the standard.

I don't think you understand the point. People argue that the way businesses, or in this case something like Bitcoin, are valued is no longer relevant due to some mysterious "paradigm shift". But anyone that knows history knows that no matter how technology improves, there are certain fundamental valuation models that always prove out. 
I like Bitcoin and I see value in Bitcoin. The technology is like nothing we've seen, but there is no paradigm shift that will change the way value is assigned to something in the longterm.

You're missing the whole point of sovereignty. It's the reason you can own property in your family for 100 year, fail to pay property taxes one year and lose it to the government. The government owns the land, not businesses, not consumers. And the government, with their military demand tribute in the form of taxes. You will pay those taxes with the legal currency that they tell you to pay it in. There is no way around that. Getting a fucking bookstore to accept payment in dollars or bitcoin does nothing. It changes nothing. Because the bookstore still has to convert those bitcoin back to dollars to pay their employees, to pay their vendors and most importantly to pay the government.

There's nothing to debate, the cops confirmed he said it.
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:42:41
First, you weren't just referring to healthcare, you said "he's done exactly what he promised", which is so far form being the truth that it's laughable. 
Second, the Patriot Act and mass surveillance affects every single person, not just some. Some may not realize how it affects them, but they are affected. 
Health care reform on the other hand, does not affect everyone, at least not positively (some positive, some negative, some not at all). Most people already had health insurance so they were either not affected at all, or had their premiums increase to pay for the newly insured. Those who were uninsured no doubt see a benefit, those who had their premiums double or triple (like myself) or not as pleased. 
Either way, your statement that he kept all his promises was either ill-informed or a lie. I'm guessing you were just ill-informed so hopefully we've helped address that here.

The cops verified what the question was and his answer to it, a lot of people on here apparently didn't know that part of it since it came out a week later. And she dropped a bitcard off to him 2 hours prior to the interview so he knew what was being discussed beforehand. 
I get it though, the story blew up and he had no idea it would be this big of a deal. Then upon realizing his life was now in danger he decided to deny it. I can't blame him.

Yup, I can definitely see the US Government and the large banks of the world letting bitcoin grow to the point where they lose their control of the world currency markets.

I would encourage you to do a little more reading on what a *legal tender* is and the impact of that in the monetary system. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:09:33
All debts are immediate. So if it takes a fraction of a second to settle a payment, that debt legally exists for that fraction of a second. 
Also, you're not required to *only* accept payments in dollars, but what the legal tender designation means is if anyone offers USD to settle a debt you are legally required to accept it as payment, or the debt is not considered legally valid. 
You are free to accept anything else as payment as well, but you are not *required* to accept anything else. So, Bitcoin is perfectly fine for anyone to accept as a form of payment. If you have a liquor store in Detroit, you can accept Mexican pesos form your customers if you want. It's up to you. But you are not allowed to not accept USD, which is what differentiates something as a legal currency vs just another form of payment. 
In other words, bitcoin is a great payment system and has a lot of benefits to it, much like Paypal revolutionized online payments, except even more so since it is decentralized. However, it will **never** displace the legal tender of a sovereign nation. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:26:55

I see you didn't read the exact quote. It doesn't say Bitcoms in it, and saying you're "no longer" involved in something indicates you were involved in something. And saying it's been "turned over to other people" indicates first hand knowledge of who is running it now.

Here, I'll save us some time. 
The US government would cease to exist if it lost control of its own currency. The US government has the largest military the world has ever known. The US government has never hesitated to murder people by the tens of thousands for far less of a threat to its sovereignty. 
You keep believing they'll allow bitcoin or any of the thousands of other crypto-currencies to overthrow their sovereignty and I'll put my money on the people with the nuclear weapons who control the prisons, the media and the banking system.

@_date: 2014-03-14 22:37:26
You're still missing the point - the fact that the bookstore **has to** convert the bitcoin to dollars in the first place is the entire problem with bitcoin. 
The fact that there is a service to convert their bitcoins to dollars in real time is awesome, and it makes bitcoin a viable *payment option*, like Paypal. But it will never act as a currency due to the reasons I already stated - they eventually have to pay their employees, vendors and taxes in dollars. Why? Because USD is a currency, and bitcoin is (and will only ever be) a payment option; like Paypal, Western Union, conch shells, or money orders.

No, the value of the dollar is based on a lot more. Let me know when you can pay your taxes with bitcoin or for that matter when companies only pay their employees in bitcoin and stores only accept bitcoin.
Bitcoin is valued in dollars (or yen or euro etc), precisely because of the governments that maintain sovereignty over land and issue currency.

Having the option to pay for something in bitcoin is not the same as being legally required to pay for something in bitcoin. The USD is legal tender, meaning people are **required** to accept it *"for all debt both public and private"*. 
Bitcoin is just an additional form of payment like anything else, but in the end all debts must be settled in dollars.

@_date: 2014-03-03 18:14:14
Right, so they've offered a server OS for as long as Linux has existed, and yet Linux has not impacted their revenue in any way that you can demonstrate. 
I mean, I'd *like* it to be true, since I'm a big fan of open source. But all I can go off of is their revenue as a company and from that standpoint Linux has not had any noticeable effect.
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:11:12


Except with his initial quotes cryptically acknowledging his role then denying it and the fact the quotes from the story were later verified by the cops that were on the scene - all of that would make it unlikely to prove reckless disregard.

Just keep in mind that there are millions of people who have other things that they find as important as you find Obamacare (like for instance, civil liberties, not droning thousands of innocent civilians to death, not ordering the assassination of US citizens without trial, etc). For those people, Obama may in fact be the worst President the country has ever had, a close second to Bush. 
What I find most interesting isn't that you love Obama, there are lot of people that do. It's that you find it impossible to admit that he didn't keep all of his promises. That's scary.

No, but your analogy doesn't account for the fact that Microsoft has many revenue drivers (or pies, if you'd like). And their revenue continues to grow quarter after quarter, so it's hard to see how Linux has damaged them.

Yeah I can see that argument, but that was never a projected revenue source for Micorsoft was it? Certainly not when he made that statement. They make their money from Windows and Office, and I don't see how Linux has impacted that to any real degree.

No, it's not.
