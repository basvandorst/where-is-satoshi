On the flip side, do you think Bitcoin will ever go below $1,000 again? Even if it went to $1,000, it would still be up from its starting price of just a few cents. People will still buy it for use as a darknet market currency if nothing else.

Are you sure Satoshi didn't use the term "hash outputs" instead? I've heard of a *coinbase* (not the exchange), and each TX has one, that must be what you're thinking of.
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:59:54
I didn't literally mean it "pegs" it to the dollar in the way Tether does, what I meant was that it explicitly reduces bitcoin to nothing but a centralized, speculative object (not that it pretty much isn't already), and any advantage that bitcoin had over fiat goes out the window. Example, if you lose a lawsuit and the judge orders financial disclosure, your precious bitcoin ETF can be sold off to pay the plaintiff's compensation, which would NEVER happen if you just held it in an offline wallet.

I doubt very many teenage girls even know what bitcoin is, or care about it if they do. But anyway, all I was really saying is that a bitcoin ETF is an oxymoron from this 'old world' point of view. Bitcoin's tagline 'be your own bank' now means nothing, and any bitcoin in an ETF is subject to seizure like any other asset class, ex. if you lose a lawsuit and the judge orders a financial disclosure, then poof, your bitcoin is all gone, which can never happen if you just keep it in an offline wallet.
