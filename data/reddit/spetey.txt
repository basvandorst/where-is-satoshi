Where is this feature documented? I'm not clear how it works.

Oh man - I couldn't see the image well but guessed 'Halley' because I saw 'Astronomy' (I think) in the open book, and '1705' on the book next to it - but I didn't get the Reddit message to the second cryptobin.

You guys make good points. But whatever you may think of Google's score on the "don't be evil" meter, those folks are *smart*, and they invested in Ripple - along with some other VCs who may or may not be clever, but presumably did their homework before putting up big $. Why, I wonder, do *they* think it's going to be such a success?

Yeah I have to admit I don't get this either, though I've seen it in futures contexts: "market-makers" who profit from the "spread".
For example, they list the bid as higher than the ask. Well ... shouldn't those two get together? Shouldn't crypto.st execute such trades until the bit is lower than the ask again?

Too tantalizingly close. Someone please finish it, so I can go back to regular life!

Why do you have the impression libertarians aren't part of the elite? Do you know about the Koch brothers, or the other uber-rich who justify their wealth ex-post-facto with Ayn Randian drivel?
I am largely sympathetic to key planks of libertarianism (social liberalism, letting the market determine prices), but not to abolishing all government. Frankly it's what worries me about bitcoin the *most*.

I'm used to [Slashdot]( (the old person's reddit), where the [xkcd]( reference is obligatory.

Huh. How interesting. I never thought of professors, non-profits, and police officers as part of "the elite" - but you have me curious. Of course in a sense they're in a worldwide elite class compared to, say, Somali refugees. But now I don't understand how this elite, so-defined, are a threat - and how bitcoin will save us from them.
Call me cynical but in the US anyway, I think big money has more dangerous impact on the government than NPOs and cops.

Or [chatzilla]( which might be even easier, if you can coordinate the time to chat.
Or [bitmessage]( of course! It's impressively easy once it's installed.

There are obviously still trust issues (as suggested by "hopefully" in 4).
It seems to me that there's room for professional arbitrators - third parties to multi-sig escrow transactions who gain neutral reputations and charge a fee (but, presumably, still a much smaller fee than traditional routes).
