A couple weeks ago I bought a couple bitcoins through an ATM in Chicago since they just started putting them in a year or two ago. I'm hoping that the introduction of these ATMs will increase the accessibility of bitcoin and perhaps spark some interest. And again, they only started this in Chicago like two years ago, so it's still really new. I got all excited for a moment too when the value spiked, but it has since receded. Is the best way to hold on to bitcoins just to keep them in my wallet? I have a two factor set-up and all that, but I want to make sure all my money is safe. (I'm using GreenAddress btw)

I bought them to spend on things online, I know there are many websites like [Amazon?] that are starting to accept this form of currency and I figured that if I invest now, it would be more advantageous than doing so later. I hope that maybe people will see the ATMs and be like "What the hell are bitcoins?" and then maybe do some research. Probably won't catch on just because of ATMs, but if they become popular enough than those of us who Do have bitcoins or don't want to walk around with a ton of cash in the city will be able to deposit just about anywhere. Far-fetched, but it's just a thought.

What is the best way to invest in bitcoin? Would it be to just buy lots of bitcoins or am I late to the punch? (I am not talking about turning a huge profit or anything, I just know that the value changes a lot and I don't know if it's something I should commit to as an investment)
