"Low" is relative. For all we know this could be the new high point for the rest of the year. In which case it would be better to sell now and take a lesser loss than to hold and take an even greater loss.
If you end up doing a lot of investing, some losses are inevitable no matter how good you are. A successful investor knows when to cut his losses, while it's the person that holds on no matter what when his stock dips that will end up broke.
Not saying it is the case here by the way. Just talking about investing in general.

(Unexperienced investors)+(Continuously winning big on your first investment item [Bitcoin]) = (Thinking investing is easy) = (Bad ending)
No doubt in my mind that a huge crash in crypto isn't very far off. I say that as somebody who believes strongly in the future of cryptocurrencies. I've been watching this sub for a while and it's very clear that many people think that just because crypto has a strong future that the value will overall continue to rise as it has done despite its volatility. Most people here are probably too young to remember the dotcom bubble, but it bears a lot of resemblance to that.
