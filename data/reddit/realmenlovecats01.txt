What politicians and 'economists' against bitcoin keep saying is Bitcoin is unregulated, and isn't backed by gold. I hear that one a lot. USA hasn't had the gold standard since the pre-Nixon days! Plus, there's a HELL of a lot more money laundering going on with actual cash than BTC, and you can't exactly counterfeit Bitcoin...

That's good I like it!

Fake cash too. Try faking a bitcoin!

I think government reasoning for destroying privacy is coming from a magic 8-ball. "Child porn", "Terrorism", "Drug dealers", "Money launderers", "Nothing to fear; nothing to hide", "Spew some random crap and hope the public takes it", and "Can't think of an answer right now..please try again later."

Hi! Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior Satoshi?

But don't you know? Encryption is only for the elite! Can't let the citizens have that...Oh wait, banks use it. The military uses it. Everyone with an iPhone uses it. Many android users use it. (the phones aren't the strongest encryption, but they work well enough) 
The bottom line is you can't ban math. Any idiot can make encryption software by looking up how to do so, and it would literally be impossible to erase all info on encryption from the web. This isn't about catching criminals at all, it's about taking away personal liberties in the name of "security". The feds have failed time and time again trying to catch somebody when they weren't even using GPG or tor.
Every time I see another stupid news headline like this one, I can't help but be reminded of the Ben Franklin quote on liberty.

The child pornography argument is REALLY getting old. When the CIA did long-term undercover work on tor sites trying to find kiddie porn distributors, they found that they were mostly talking to each other.
The terrorism argument? Take the Paris attacks or the Boston bombing for example. In both the attackers used NO ENCRYPTION WHATSOEVER. Plain text SMS.

Hey! Congrats on being part of the 21 club!

Having 21 BTC. Since there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, there can only ever be a million in the 21 club. (realistically much fewer holders) so basically, you're in the top &lt;1% of bitcoin holders.

I thought I was the only one who noticed that about Ross not sounding like some of the stuff DPR said on the forums. I assumed he was on drugs at the time though.

And those are only the big markets- There's thousands of onion sites that are operated by vendors to avoid being on a market like nucleus or alphabay.

Yeah uh converting money to physical property to then move around is like the  way of laundering...

Many of the DPR posts on the forums read in a different voice. Not like Ross on drugs and ranting, but a totally different person.
