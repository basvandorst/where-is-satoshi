You should be using more clearly delineated OAuth scopes and making it more explicit when an app requests a scope that allows transferring out funds. Having a "full access" scope is generally a bad idea.

So, what it really needs is a patch for an option to "Pay with Bitcoin". 
Alternatively, I wonder if there would be any way to setup a Bitcoin -&gt; Amazon Payments mechanism, then you could encourage people to still use the built-in payment method, but be depositing to Amazon via Bitcoin.

I'm not sure what that rant is about, but it seems like you feel threatened and made a lot of ad hominem responses because of it. I'm not trying to influence you on what to do with BTC, if I thought I knew what would happen with it then I would either buy all I could or sell all I could. But your ad hominem is misplaced, I've been trading stocks, options, and futures since '98. If you are making big profits on BTC, good for you, you know more about how it's going to move then I do, but that doesn't change the fact that your statements contradict.
As a sidenote, your statement on bull markets is decidedly incorrect, there are plenty of accessible research studies on the subject of bull markets and they show definitively that even if the participants all know what is going to happen, a bull market will still occur, followed by its respective bubble. Take a gander at Predictably Irrational if you own it, or if you like I can forward you some studies that are behind paywalls.

**No, there isn't.**
First of all, you just stipulated what I just said, 




So, where's your disconnect there? You stipulated exactly what I just said. Why are you getting upvoted for that?
Secondly, I should have stipulated that I was talking very specifically about our use case. We receive unlimited, fee-free transactions through Paypal. Are bitpay.com and walletbit.com going to give us *100% completely fee-free* transactions and pay us in USD and also take payments out and give them back to users, again all with no fee? Are they also going to handle all chargebacks and fraud? If so, then we can start talking about the tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs they are going to be willing to be willing to shoulder to handle the contracts that need to be written up, and maybe then we can get moving on something.
Oh, and they are going to also ensure they never hold on to any funds, handle any technical problems, handle any U.S. government issues, guarantee us that they will not suddenly stop accepting payments and payouts due to U.S. government intervention (it's completely unacceptable to have even a remote chance of losing funds due to U.S. government intervention). They are also going to guarantee all funds against any security issues, and they have a bond in place which is used specifically for the purpose of paying out funds that get lost due to any technical failure or security breach?
I'm 100% behind bitcoin, but I'm also a realist, and there are a lot of issues to solve that you and others are all too willing to gloss over.

I'm curious why you think this is a great use for Bitcoin when the fees described are going to be more than the fees this person is paying now. This person would be done studying before the fees came below the current 3% cost, plus they would now have to deal with the added risks of exchanges instead of government insured bank accounts.
Seriously, I want to see Bitcoin flourish, but why is this the highest upvoted advice when it's not safer, not more prudent, and has volatility involved, all things the OP specifically wanted to avoid.

What is the hackerspace? Are you talking about NoiseBridge?
Edit: And if you are talking about NoiseBridge, it would seem their policy is to accept Bitcoins via a Board Member who then converts them to cash and donates them to the 501c3. I suppose technically that's a case worth bringing up to our lawyer, though I doubt I can convince the board member that it's worth taking the time to learn how to use Bitcoin in order to make donations to Kiva.
@_date: 2012-11-13 19:59:49
I can't find anything on their site about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-09 07:38:16
Good luck, we wanted to do it at Kiva, but legal team shut us down.
@_date: 2012-11-16 06:02:31
Yes, you are correct. Though potentially a first step for us might be to accept Bitcoin donations, once the other legal uncertainties were figured out.
@_date: 2012-08-18 00:14:36
Oh, and here is the same indicated in the Atlantic: 
@_date: 2012-11-01 19:37:52
You should understand that development time is not often the main barrier to integration, it's being able to answer legal uncertainties.

Instability isn't a problem for our adoption, though obviously is a problem for adoption by the general public, it all comes down to legal issues, how we can handle people's money as a non-profit, etc. Unless bitpay puts the money in a trust fund, along with a bond or insurance covering the payout of the money in case of issue, then it's not viable currently (for our purposes).
For an example of why this is important, take a look a PokerStars and Full Tilt. Poker flew under the radar for a while in the U.S., even after payments to poker sites were outlawed by the government, then boom one day the Justice department shuts down the sites. Now, I was able to get all my money back from PokerStars. Why?  Because they maintained the money in a trust fund and were very diligent about setting up the proper legal and financial structure to ensure Poker funds were kept separate from company funds and that they could legally pay them out. Not so with Full Tilt Poker. 
Bitpay has only recently gone from being an LLC (in fact their domain still has certificates in the LLC name not in the Inc. name), and has pretty much no legal documentation to speak of available on their site (there is a very short privacy policy and TOU that I can find).
But the main problem here is still the two elephants in the room, that the U.S. government has not made a ruling on the legality of Bitcoin, meaning legislation could be enacted at any time outlawing its use, and that 501c3 non-profits have very strict reporting and audit requirements. Do you know of any 501c3 non-profits that are accepting Bitcoins? Do you know why the EFF stopped accepting Bitcoins?
And I'm on the same page, I am pro-Bitcoin, but I'm also realistic and not living in a fantasy land where everything magically works out.

You just contradicted yourself. You made four statements:








If people are losing confidence in fiat, then gold prices will up as well as BTC. You could argue people are switching from gold to BTC as the safe currency to hold, but that doesn't jive with your third statement that BTC is not in mass appeal yet (which is true, it's not). You can't have all 4 of these statements be true.

Why are you guys mindlessly upvoting a scam? Is this what you want people to think of Bitcoin, that's its useful for scamming people? I mean this is only tangentially related to Bitcoin at best, and it's still just like posting a scam from Craigslist or Ebay. 
@_date: 2012-11-12 18:44:53
That's right we are a non-profit charity, good to know about bitpay doing fee-free transactions.
As for PayPal, we have a legal contract with them (separate from their boilerplate user agreements and such).

It's simple, he created a ponzi scheme and convinced people to give him bitcoins with "guaranteed" inflated returns. Like any good ponzi scheme, some people got their money back, but when things got tight he took the money and ran.
@_date: 2012-11-09 16:45:57
Funny you should mention that, a fellow engineer and I were just discussing that the other day. However, there's no solution that doesn't involve changing bitcoins into USD before we get them. For what it's worth, we currently don't accept any other currencies than USD due to legal concerns, so not just Bitcoin (whether these concerns are justified or not I don't know, but I trust our lawyer). It's the same concern I believe the EFF has, which is why they gave up their Bitcoins they had received. 
P.S. Go Nerdfighters! Love Nerdfighters :)

Seems like the trading companies should be filing this, as they can petition it would harm their business. I'd think we should ask a lawyer before filing on the behalf of an individual. 
That said, I'd be happy to donate towards such a cause, if we could get some sort of legal advice on it before filing.

Last Friday was a holiday weekend in the U.S. and some other places. You'll usually see a buck in the trend on days before holiday weekend in many markets.

Thanks for the vote of confidence, I suppose now it's time to find out if the bounty is for real. I and some colleagues gave a presentation to the organization about bitcoin about 4 or 5 months ago now, and we discussed how we might go about implementing it, so it's definitely on the radar. The main hurdle of adopting bitcoin isn't really the technical side, but rather the legal and audit requirements. That said, if we want it to happen, the first step would be for us to put the code in place necessary to facilitate the transactions, after which it would be easier to sell the legal team on the idea.  
I will point out that, although I'm a big fan of Bitcoin, I'm not sure that it would necessarily make the cost of doing business cheaper for Kiva or for the borrowers, for many reasons, it could in the end, but I'd really have to crunch some numbers and conceptualize the pieces more before knowing. Either way, there are at least 3-4 of us here who are really interested in implementing it, given enough time.

I don't know of anywhere that simply charges a flat rate for electricity and never adjusts for usage, is this the case for you? At least in the U.S., pretty much all electricity is charged by use, and "free" electricity is an assumption that simply can never be made. Perhaps, if you are mining off of a university's power or something, but you are still putting the cost on someone else. That said, I agree that expecting Bitcoin to rise in value for no other reason than speculation is missing the point.

Could it be a non-profit business? [We]( fit the other requirements, asides from the fact that don't sell items, rather provide a service of connecting altruistic lenders to impoverished entrepreneurs. 
The reason I ask is cause we discussed being able to do this, and we have innovation iterations where such a project could get done, and it would get done a lot faster if there was a BTC bounty to motivate other engineers to work on it.
@_date: 2011-10-05 00:03:18
See now that was a perfectly valid response that would  have been much better to have started with.

Just to note, that is solely my own portfolio, people at Kiva can lend to whichever borrower they wish, there is even a group that lends to "Men with no Shirts" 
As to why I lend my money to mostly women, it's just a personal preference. 
@_date: 2011-10-12 00:15:19
Nice, thanks for the coverage. I'm mrchilly and you can find me on Kiva at  
The way the bitcoin forums are setup, seemed like putting in a few posts in the newbies area was the way to go. Definitely want to talk more about a sort of roadmap for how Kiva could technically implement Bitcoin, and what some of the hurdles are, so I'll follow up later, for now, branch cut is tomorrow so I've work to do first :)
@_date: 2013-01-31 03:39:54
I don't know what you think you know, but I actually talked directly with the EFF's legal counsel and many more EFF staff, so no.

Hey, have you contacted "Contact Us" at Kiva about accepting Bitcoin? If not, could you do so, or even if you haven't done it lately.
I'm a software engineer at Kiva, and made a previous push for Bitcoin, but it was a little before it's time for our lawyer, about 1.5 years ago. I'm looking to make another push again in a few months, now that there are some mainstream sites accepting Bitcoin. So the more people who write in about it the better.
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:10:19
Excellent, thank you, I can point to this now in our customer service case log. I'm thinking of maybe getting some support on to one day run a letter writing campaign to customer service for this, I'm just first waiting for a sign from legal that they'll allow us to move forward.

Google uses Citibank exchange rates (read their disclaimer) so if you convinced Citibank to monitor it then Google would provide it. But still what is right in this scenario? We (Kiva) have a hell of a time getting the "right" exchange rate for the South Sudanese Pound due to unreliable data and little reporting, where would one get the value you would use for BTC?
@_date: 2013-01-29 17:59:40
Yes, actually. Unfortunately, legal uncertainties have kept us from doing so, though with Wordpress now accepting Bitcoin, that problem (the legal uncertainty) might get solved this year. If it did then we could work on moving forward again, I wouldn't anticipate anything from us though for 2013.
