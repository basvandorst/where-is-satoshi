Breadwallet for iOS ����
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:44:15
I mean just send another transaction with higher fees 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:43:59
Breadwallet or Mycelium 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:35:35
Thanks for your detailed reply! :)
I chose " regular" in my wallet client, if I knew the mempool was high I'd have chosen  " priority" or just check the current mempool myself I enter the sat manually like 150 . 
Meh, at least i didn't lose it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:07:25
Confirmed by now :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:03:16
Wait 6 more days ... then it'll be almost free
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:27:30
What if I send another transaction to the same address/different address. Would the 2nd transaction go through with high fees ? Or I have  wait for this to confirm ...
Thanks in advance
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:36:34
I'm 100% positive the guy had an actual 950 btc in that hard drive, then transferred it to another wallet and sold HDD. Didn't even bother about the 950 BTC write at that time.  ��‍♂️ keep us posted bro
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:09:48
So you mean if I have btc setting in my wallet I should wait for segwit in that case transfer fees r less ? 
Sorry newbie 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:14:35
Confirmed by now :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:34:00
Ye I need one for saving without risking my coins after Nov fork. For the spending wallet it's fine but my BTC Savings I don't know where to store them to avoid this shit.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:38:17
"CPFP"You mean via 3rd party? I red it's not that helpful.
What do you mean by " double spending " ? I mean I don't mind both transactions going to the same wallet. I just want one faster than another. :/
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:04:10
Yup. Finally confirmed 
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:49:49
I mean even after the fork they can't change your BTC as Breadwallet is not an exchanger participate 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:04:01
What do you mean by " parent " ? 
I didn't send it through Electrum so I think I can't RBF, right ? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:54:45
So, if I send same coins with higher fee it'll go through with the previous transaction and will be marked " double spent". ? 
What if I send a different amount of coins with higher fee would the 2nd transaction go through without the  " double spent " thing  ? I don't care about the first one I can wait. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:10:30
Is it because of the mempool size at the moment ? So whenever it gets down or a miner decide to mine it ?
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:10:35
Because nobody HODL 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:14:07
Australia to follow 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:14:54
Lol even ur balance 4$ 
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:45:21
Yeah I don't get the fees thing, I mean should I wait and they will go down ? Or it depends on what exactly ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:29:48
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:54:43

@_date: 2017-08-16 03:42:50
Newbie question : 
What's the point of a mixer ? Since btc is anonymous as far as I know. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:00:56
Took 4 hours for me yesterday with 84 sat 
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:34:32
I luv bread 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:12:00

@_date: 2017-08-22 06:33:34

@_date: 2017-08-21 09:15:47
Oh shit , so a serous mempool attack could cause s lot of troubles that way... it's a cyberwar tbh
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:52:15
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:55:18
I'd say buy while it's ~ 5000
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:47:32

@_date: 2017-08-16 13:36:44
Dude I got a lot of bitcoins at 300$ n spent all of them on random stuff. Regret ? Nah . Because I'm sure I'll use it either way the only lucky ppl who forgot about their btc n came back from them now 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:32:56

Thank you :( would appreciate it if u provide links

4800~ by Friday 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:25:53
Security reasons ? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:10:59
You don't get the point of btc. 
Bitcoin should be widely used and in everyday transaction. By that the price will go 10x
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:44:28
Contact bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:42:24
Thanks a lot !! 
Wow I'm so lucky then with 83 sat, it may get confirmed within hours.
PS: wtf there's 20 sat transaction :| GL
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:04:35
Wow... ok don't cry, here's the link
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:59:23
Nvm got it
Every bitcoin transaction that's sent flows into what's called the mempool (short for memory pool) before it can be confirmed by miners. When there's a dramatic spike in transaction activity, the mempool can become congested because so many transactions are waiting to be included in the next block.
Bitcoin users across the network may notice their transactions sit as unconfirmed or pending for a longer period of time, and we understand this can cause users to be concerned about the status of their funds.
In most cases, your transactions will eventually confirm. It may just take longer than usual to do so. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:14:49
Same. I don't understand fees. Like if I waited will they drop down ? Is it high because there's a lot of transactions going at this time ? Or because the BTC  price is high ? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:13:17
That's amazing, thanks now I understand the concept of people waiting for a certain amount of confirmation before accepting your order and I always wondered how tf could that happen. Now all make sense 
Yes I should use electrum RBF next time, just in case 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:04:32
I feel u bro *hug*
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:57:29
Really good, only if you keep them in separate location. So if somebody found it he don't get the full stash  
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:06:49
Can you help me with something ? After the new updates is it safe to keep my coins in breadwallet ? Anyways I'm good till Nov fork right ?
Thanks in advance *please don't go mad on me*
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:41:52
What's wrong with Segwit2x and breadwallet...? I don't see any connection :/ please advice me as I'm using the same wallet 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:53:09
They accept bitcoin in my local area for food &amp; waffles :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:43:01
What's a mempool. Is it the transactions happening right now ? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:09:09
Shit... what do recommend for IOS wallet ? I moved my BTC from exchange sites just for that reason I don't want them to be forked 
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:34:26
Double spend 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:13:51
What about the next fork in Nov, I mean we have no option right ? Even hardwallet I'm afraid to flush my 2x coins :( please guide me 
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:28:33
True, do you know about Mycelium? Or same case they may change..? 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:07:16
See this and be sure to read the comments 
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:48:12
You don't have to own the whole coin. 1BTC can be divided into bits "1,000,000 bitc = 1 BTC"
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:30:09
True but 50% now keep an eye on the market and buy the dip 50%. A small dip won't cause harm to you ( 300£). So in my personal opinion BUY
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:06:27
Ye I know, all miners situation are temporary because they care about $$$ at the moment and there's a market for it "BCC" not for that long ofc. 
So if I just ignore this transaction it'll pop up in my wallet one day. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:28:28
Let me translate it for u, 
Buy a hardware wallet but all your shit in it. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:26:38
Yes I'm save till Nov, what if I moved my coins to a hard wallet or Mycelium wallet, would be better/safer . ?
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:11:36
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:14:12
Localbitcoins :p
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:20:41
Thanks !
