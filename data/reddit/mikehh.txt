Wire it to an exchange that will carry the lift and execute a buy order.

it will most likely have an inverse correlation to the dollar- gold hikes when the dollar is weak- bitcoin in theory should take the same direction.

If they were willing to pay that- it means they see things going much, much higher if crypto is allowed to compete with fiat currency.

if it is not their goal then your right- they will not throw money at people to impress- but if it was one of the drivers in your success then they absolutely will purchase said asset/liability.

The same perma bear that would have bankrupted you if you listened to him post 2009. 
There is an angle to everything he says and it’s not your profit.

Easy to snipe a bear market like this.  What if you had it 4 years ago.  
Let’s be real. 10k today at... let’s say 4000 for argument sake.  Pop this thread in 2 years.  
 Bears and market losers pulled this monday morning quarterbacking on equities a decade ago.  
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:29:59
There was alot of resistance at 4 and when it broke turned into support? (maybe?)  bots/sell orders compounding- not sure- huge volume though.  maybe big money stop loss on entry orders after it went above 4k??  just fascinating.  Love seeing the volume.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:42:35
If we’re truly in a bull he’s right. Look at the charts in the last 90 days. Run. 2 week retracement and consolidation.  Break out and run higher. 
Be patient. Don’t ever go all in again. You *should* be just fine. I as well as many other people are long with you and had to enter the market at one time or another. It’s stressful.  It’s also awesome.  
Good luck reddit friend.
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:41:12
Your right-  my point was. Google one of many winners was basically an unknown in 99-00. Yahoo was king.  Five years later it was the big win. Pre ipo got insanely wealthy.  Ipo got wealthy.  
Take google out of it.  The internet, as you said not only recovered but thrived.  Buy crypto today if you have time and risk tolerance.  There are many parallels. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:40:02
With the trends of this run and comparing it to the last 3 bull cycles were very, very early.  You May break much faster than 3-6 months. 
Gl don’t ever go all in to the point where you lose sleep or can’t pay bills over an investment

your right- in general if you buy and sell in contrary to the retail trader you will win much more than you lose- some alts are dead as Dillinger.

There is a lot to see here besides top line revenue.  We have no idea how cash flow is positioned- it also may be a strategic merger- that would make sense.

Roubini is a perma bear-  read his stuff after 08-09- almost none of it came to pass.  he gets air time scaring people

2 admin accts. Both have to login and approve.  Never an issue in past. Now either can start but neither confirmation will work.  
No other admins on acct.

Retail Traders get killed-  If your investing follow this simple mantra to win more than you will lose- Buy When most are seilling- sell when most are buying.   Maxing out your CC's to buy BTC at all time highs is the exact opposite of this.   These are the same people who cashed out their retirements in 09.  
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:54:49
Should the chart not be comparing GDP as a top line instead of tax revenue?  The economy is fueled by GDP not taxes.   
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:14:31
You sound like every bear in every asset class in the history of the markets- the same shit was being spewed about the equities market in 09, and real estate, the dollar.  Broken clock is right twice a day.  
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:40:03
that was one example- there were many other winners-  msft, ebay, yahoo, ask, hundreds of others-  and in any bull more than half of new businesses fail- so im not sure why were being snappy.  point is the sector was beyond recovery by 05.  In our current example were talking currency on top of tech and equity so the swings will be much more levered.  
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:40:14
So your taking this WAAAYY off topic from if tech trading works.  If your really trying to have a convo lets keep the red herrings out.
But to entertain you: 
Lets just say this- Billionaires and most millionaires don't "have a gig" they leverage the sweat equity of others- not relevant to technicians.
Gambling- not even worth debating here- but given the volume of people that live well off of  sports gaming and poker i will disagree with you- wanna make a living off craps good luck. But this is not the point of this conversation so please stop trying to make the parallel.  
The Charts patterns- What was the call- All he said is things look bullish- no time frame no entry point. On his chart I only see a Very short term support resistance line that showed return to 3600 at least and an eventual bullish trend-  But this is OP's strategy so I don't know if he won or lost. Maybe he had an STO order at resistance and a stop a 3800 with a huge buy at support and a stop at 3550- hes killing it if so.  Maybe he went all in right there going north and got stopped out.  That being said it looked like his support and resistance lines were not to terrible
There are different setups for different people- Its about risk mgt and using leverage to have your wins eclipse your losses. 
Your a hodler right? me too- i believe in the underlying asset.  Wanna discuss tech- all day- just don't try to sound morally and educationally superior about things you haven't studied and don't necessarily agree with.  
If this is going to go back to - Funny line's, billioniares do x or gambling then ill wish you a good day.

Its a bitgo wallet- im just going to say it. I have had several and never had this issue.  Cust support has been nice but not concerned with a timeline or the fact that i have- well what i consider a significant amount of capital locked up.   I have 2 party admin approval on all outbound moves and since last week i get an error on the second approval- one acct says bad password the other says the cost has changed.  No password issues.  
Like i said im newish here so i didn't want to confuse terms and ask what was appropriate and what was not.  Very concerning they will not even give me a time-frame or would have told me to use my private key.  While the customer service got back to me they were very clear that they were busy and would get to the "error with my account" when they could and had no timeframe or concern beyond that.  I think everyone here should know that.  They more i think about this the more frustrated im getting.  
I have the keys- will look at that route.

Its not an exchange- its a company where the CEO posts here from time to time and they pride their selves on security.  If I get a lot of feedback like this and no further response my intent was to contact him directly- I'm not looking to drag anyone through the mud as long as they resolve this. 
  
I think its unreasonable personally that my capital is frozen like this- a bank could not get away with this as long as the funds are moved digitally- our ecosystem should be held to higher standards- I guess I'm verifying that I'm not being out of line before i take the next steps.  
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:56:28
TL;DR technical error keeping my wallet from moving out funds- no timeline of resolution from support, but fairly prompt polite customer service aside from no resolution- what is acceptable here as a consumer?

Are we confusing Bubble with an asset with an extremely high vix?  A bubble should mean there are underlying forces pushing the asset price higher than it should be, no?  Like education in the US now being outrageously priced due to the gov't guaranteeing no default loans bond holders and not letting students default-  I think your hard press to say there is a derivative force propping up bitcoin even in 2017- it was reckless speculation for the most part.

As a follow up for anyone searching, a great engineer from bitgo figured the solution out.  There was an issue with 2 different admin acct's being on 2 different pay structures as the accounts were formed a year and a half apart.  While i think Bitgo should have been ahead of this they were quick to spend a lot of time to help me once the engineers got involved-  I emailed the CTO with feedback and he was great with his interaction.  I will use them again.

BTC has some of the tightest technical patterns in market- its funny how people just say people don't make a living flipping technical's because it "looks like random lines" to them.  Get educated instead of talking trash.

Recession like in 09 where they lost control of the USD or an inflation control based recession like 03/00/92?    One wont be bad (relatively) and the other will be bullish for non dollar commodities/assets not tied to the economy.
