Don't use blockchain in the first place. . .  If you don't save your private key from your web wallet, then you are just using a bank like with normal money, you are not in control of your bitcoin, someone else is.

SX127x is the long range transceiver that would be commercially available and is in use by several different dev boards like the esp32 heltec or ttgo lora32 as well as LoraPy micropython but these are all dev boards. As far as the PHY &amp; MAC of LoraWAN specs I am not sure of because I don’t actually use LoraWAN I just do my own networking solution the hack way by just minimally sending encrypted strings of text between the devices and not interfacing any sort of internet connected network I used them more as a packet radio between two iPhones via Bluetooth but read up on the LoraWAN specs and check out the things network and their forum because they set up free public LoraWAN gateways and such.

lol the number 666 is symbolic, its not a literal mark that people have on their right hand or foreheads, it is a symbolic seal that either you have chosen to follow God and lived by His character to earn the seal of approval of God or you follow the world ultimately led by Satan who counterfeits god which is where 666 comes from because Gods number is 7, 7th day rest, 7 days of creation and the trinity represents 3 in one so the counterfeit to God's number 777 would be represented by 666.
