I'd be down for a widget.

T-minus 10 seconds.....10...9....

Does that costume come in golden B's?
@_date: 2014-06-10 20:24:34
Sometimes people amaze me....not in a good way either.
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:13:46
Don't hate me for not knowing...Can I use Coinbase in Canada?
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:25:07
I kind of leaning towards quickbt.com. Or would that be a terrible mistake?
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:14:51
Is mycelium a good wallet? 
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:28:33
Thank you so much!!! I finally figured out how to get it! Are you Canadian? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:45:37
Trust me, I also believe they went over market value but it seems that some people still think they went for under market value. So I figured I'd put my two cents into the conversation. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:47:37
Not going to lie..it's a pretty good feeling :)
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:15:25
Thanks for helping me understand a bit better!
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:44:23
I had always wanted to purchase 1 BTC and needless to say, I have finally reached my goal of owning a BTC. Thanks for being a huge part in me learning about Bitcoins! You guys rock!!
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:42:24
I take it you haven't heard of the song? 
@_date: 2014-07-10 07:18:58
Can you please define currency for me? As far as I'm concerned "currency" can basically be anything that people take in form of payment (Example: fur, gold, etc.).
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:32:39
I've been interested in bitcoin for a super long time but I need help to know where I can buy from in Canada. It looks like coinbase is US only?
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:23:58
Thank you so much! I'll put it to good use :)
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:23:10
I'm not a huge fan of paypal...Who knows though. I might! 
@_date: 2014-06-22 06:24:46
What ever happened to earning your money?
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:00:04
You tell me. Why is it in there?
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:26:20
I'm Canadian so I don't think I can use coinbase :/
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:52:10
I was thinking more like $759.63
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:36:38
I did a lot of research on this individual before working with him. But I agree, I always should be on my toes!
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:13:52
Interesting... do you know anything about this?
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:14:24
I purchased 0.3 BTC about 20 minutes before the spike....Regret is real. I wish I bought more! :P
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:17:40
Like....A paper wallet?
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:29:54
Why include the address? Am I missing something that makes the address necessary to have included in this post? (I'm skeptical of people who post their address in sad/bad luck stories.) 
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:46:03
That awkward moment when not many down vote. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:11:20
Any update? I'm fairly excited about using this!
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:42:14
Okay sweet, I am using mycelium! My collection is well on its way!! 1.7mBTC.  Woohooo! I actually can't believe how easy moving it around is. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:51:29
I have an old PC financial bank account that I haven't used for a long time. Would it be best to use that? Or is there something else I can use that won't get me put on some list by the government?
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:08:25
I'm keeping my eye out for something that I'd be interested in purchasing with it. I'm thinking a telescope.
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:19:43
Haha are you serious?!
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:29:38
thank you so much for your help. This community is probably one of the best I have found..and I'm just getting to know it. I'm really pumped to be a part of this!
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:09:57
I know this isn't in B.C., but Regina, SK sure could use an ATM. I know of many people who are interested in buying Bitcoins but can't due to the lack of availability.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:47:50
Let's start with 10 BTC lol :P
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:22:52
I signed up as I wanted the tip button for my YouTube channel brand but it won't let me hide my name. Is that correct? I'd rather have my online alias showing and my full name hidden.
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:18:27
Can I use PayPal?  If not I could use interac online I'm sure. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:00:30
I need to stop reading the comment section on Bitcoin articles...it's not good for my blood pressure.
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:26:36
 it's a branch off of CIBC
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:17:19
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:25:46
Oh yeah!! I remember you!
@_date: 2014-06-23 23:45:32
Nice! Such kindness, much generosity. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:04:46
I for one wouldn't leave it in my tip jar. I'd pull them out on a weekly basis.
@_date: 2014-07-03 04:47:55
I'll take a page out of one of your books. The roommate is in the US so this doesn't apply to him. Try again. 
If we can't use the fact that it's easy/cheap to transfer money all over the world you can't use the fact that it's free in EU. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:35:37
I was like "but I thought..." xD
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:29:03
This community is amazing...thank you so much. I'm actually shocked...
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:00:28
Can someone tell me what a XBT is? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:48:11
Unfortunately I'm from Canada and  isn't accepting BTC. I could import I guess though!
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:49:14
The tip has been confirmed over 6 times and I can see it in my coinbase account but it doesn't appear in the tip button counter. Has anyone else experienced this?
:EDIT: I should say that I sent the bits from a different wallet (just to test it out).
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:39:55
The nearest ATM to me is 2 hours away. :-/ however I am going to that city next weekend. Hmmm
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:00:52
I second this.
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:24:46
You're a life saver!
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:55:39
Will you be able to update us here when it is resolved?
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:26:57
It still isn't working :/
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:46:07
Thanks so much!! I won't forget this and hopefully I can pay it forward one day!
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:23:48
You must've been an only child.
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:56:00
I saw that this was recent and was so pumped to get back into bitcoins. Solved it. Then realized it had already been solved. Next time I'll read the comments first! :p
@_date: 2015-03-15 07:23:46
The only btm in my city charges 15% extra for buying from them. Not amazing if you ask me.
