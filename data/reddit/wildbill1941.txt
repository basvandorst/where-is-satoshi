That teacher deserves to be chewed out for giving the kid a 0%. Ponzi scheme, my butt.
And your son deserves at least one icecream for this. Tell him to keep up the good work. We're all going to be counting on his generation someday.

Memorizing 12 words, while sounding REALLY cool - I'll forget them. I know how my brain works (or doesn't work) -- that's why I use 1Password in the first place. ;) If I wrote the words down, then I'd have to put them in a safe (which I don't have and could get wiped out by fire here at home) or in a safety deposit box (which I do have, but it's an immense pain in the ass to get to).
Security's always a compromise between utility, convenience, and safety. I'm trying to address it the best way I can. But I hear what you're saying -- I'm introducing some risk if I were to do this.

Totally, but keeping it on my desk or in a drawer exposes that info to people as well.

Am playing with it on a server in my garage as I type this... waiting for the blockchain to sync up. Love this idea.
2 internets to you for being awesome.

Yeah, well, the point of 1Password is to use a strong password. :) And one of the cool things about 1Password is they explain how they encrypt their password database:
But I figure embedding the info in 1Password is a helluva lot better than just GPG'ing the file and doing something stupid like tossing it in Google Drive.
