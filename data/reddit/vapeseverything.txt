Do the right thing and spend it on drugs on the DMs.  We're here for a good time, not a long time ;)

Wakey wakey, hands off snakey!  New dawn?  We were at 13K not so long ago.  And I seem to remember something about 20K at some point.  I might have been dreaming though only on second coffee so can't be sure yet.

In times of disaster lots of people will search for something like their telecom provider repeatedly for updates or to try and contact them etc.  But if you start to look at the query for specific countries you still see the pattern of massive increase in searches:
UK - [
Germany - [
I don't think your average end user would refer to it as BTC though, they know it as bitcoin.  Possible manipulation, possibly to do with the Hurricane but not sure. Could be relatives in the specific countries searching for the telecoms provider as they cannot get in touch with their families?  If it is a temporary bump and reduces over the next few weeks then I would put it down to the hurricane.
