Exactly.. Censorship-resistance is a product of a distributed and public network that anybody can participate in. Somehow they are missing this and thinking that switching from a crappy conventional "account funds" storage method that has over-engineered fund-transferring protocols to a blockchain-based tech will somehow generate value, whilst still being under the control of singular banking/corporate entities.
The big entities can't escape the fact that they are big entities, and they try so desperately.

Physical bitcoin wallets, with USB and Bluetooth. Not a drive, that could just be copied. Something that's interacted with for signing transactions which a transaction is presented to and the signed transaction is spit back out, using an internal private key that cannot be extracted without destroying and physically extracting it, if that's even possible with flash/eeprom (IDK). Then it could also have a PIN code or something associated with it. It would be the next credit/debit card, only crypto-style. Boom.

the internet itself was not even designed to be used the way it is today: with thin-client applications and giant server farms. The internet was designed with decentralization communication as the core base concept. There needs to be more p2p applications, and bitcoin turning into a monopoly of who has the most CPU power is the antithesis of what I think people want it to be (or what it has been).. Instead of mining bitcoins you pay for a cloud-mining contract. Instead of the bitcoin network being truly decentralized, it will end up in server farms under someone's control. The same control that oppresses and restricts freedoms.
@_date: 2015-06-26 00:07:24
To the layman who doesn't think about how things work, or why, the internet seems to be providing a means for computers to communicate just fine and everything is hunky-dory. but I'm not sending this message to *you*, am I? It's meant for you, but I'm sending it to a server farm that reddit runs. That's a choke-point. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Ebay, etc are all choke-points that make our communications vulnerable to exploitation (privacy, security, finanancial/commercial, political, etc).
What I'm talking about is how DARPA's vision when designing Internet Protocol revolved around network resilience. If everything about the internet that you need is in one server farm, that's not really the internet anymore. If that server farm goes down, the ability for the network to re-route doesn't help you, because everything you're trying to do is in one place on the internet. Sure, most large websites run multiple server farms all over the globe, but that doesn't help exploitation of user communication, invasions of privacy, lack of actual tangible ownership of your own data, etc.. Your communications are hostages, and you're at the mercy of the server farm operators.
In reality, nobody needs the server farms, because the internet is designed to allow any computer to directly communicate with any other computer. Why can't I just submit this to multiple computers which relay it to more and keep a distributed instance of it for anybody to access, instead of just a central databasing system who keeps me and my communications at their mercy?
Take the recent fat shaming censoring that occurred on reddit a week or two ago. I don't care about fat shaming one way or another, what I care about is censorship, lack of options. If reddit was decentralized, distributed, with the databasing of posts and comments and votes being stored holographically across the devices of users, there would be no censorship, there would be no authority over the communcations. Isn't this ideal? There is a reason one of the youngest, and most powerful countries in the world has freedom-of-speech as one of its primary tenets. It is my belief that censorship just breeds the desire for lack of censorship..
They say 'information wants to be free'. Of course some people think this is ridiculous ("No it doesn't, it doesn't want anything."). What I take this to mean, though, is that information's innately in perpetrual transmission just by its nature. DNA, after all, is merely information, and look at how it has perpetuated itself with complete freedom. Knowledge, understanding, points of view, opinions, ideas, etc. these things are infectious. Not all of them, some are not very potent, or really contain any information. Information is simply novelty. Novelty propagates through any medium the way wind vortices and marbles bouncing off eachother in a chain reaction do.
The current way we use the internet is restricting, it is antiquated and we are approaching the time to transcend the primitive thinking that erects server farms and confines/restricts people's communications to someone or something else's idea of what those communications should be like and be comprised of. If we have the possibility of free (in both senses of the word) global communication using the underlying internet technology, do you really think what we have now with the corporately owned server farms is really going to last?
"The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols"
TL;DR: We've hardly begun to scratch the surface of the internet's potential for global communication.

"The RSCoin is deemed more likely to gain to mass acceptance than Bitcoin since the ledger would remain exclusively in the hands of the central bank, with the 'trust' factor of state authority."
LOL, it's quite the opposite way around. It is infact the very 'state authority' and the lack of trust that people have garnered towards it that are exactly why Bitcoin has taken hold in the first place.
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, as far as I can see, and trying to compete with it by creating more fiat-equivalent currency is completely back-asswards.

btc is meant to serve is a platform for payment, like paypal... sure you can invest in it as a commodity like gold, but that's not what gives it value - people using it as a means of payment for personal transactions is.
In other words: it has no value if nobody accepts it as payment - and thus would be worthless if everyone was just hoarding it just to hoard it.

...and all of this hubbub is about scaling bitcoin transaction volumes beyond that of credit cards/banks. MasterCard does 74 billion transactions a year:
    74,000,000,000 / 365 = 202,739,726 tx/day
    202,739,726 / 24hrs = 8,447,488 tx/hour
    8,447,488 / 60min = 140,791 tx/min
    140,791 / 60sec = 2346 tx/sec
 To scale BCC from 24 tx/sec to 2400 tx/sec you'd need blocks that are 100x bigger, or 800mb. LOL
 Or to be more clear:
    800mb/10min = 4800mb/hour
    4.8gb/hour = 115.2gb/day
    115.2gb/day = 3456gb/month
    3.456tb/month = 1261.44tb/year
 1.26144 petabytes a year the blockchain would grow, if you could even manage everybody broadcasting 80mb/minute, or 1.33mb per second.
 Buying that much storage space just to run nodes is silly. Even if you only wanted to scale to 10% of the banks (edit: ~230tx/sec), everybody would have to add a terabyte harddrive to their node every 3 months.

I've been trying to find out if BCC has a different block time than BTC, but all I've been able to find is that it just has an 8mb blocksize limit. I've read that BTC's 10-minute 1mb block rate limits it to 3-7 transactions per second, and on BCC's website they claim it will scale to big-bank transaction volumes - by simply multiplying the blocksize by 8.
Since when does 8x 7tx/s = 2000tx/s? Am I missing something?

Your math is way off.
You forgot that BTC is a P2P protocol. According to this: 
Someone mentions on there that they're seeing 500mb/sec upstream:
500mb/hour = 142kb/sec, which is  23% of your 600kb/sec, so then by your math BTC was handling (.23 * 2400) 550tx/sec.
According to  bitcoin is only seeing 2.6tx/sec (226942 / 24 / 60 / 60).. That's a very small number of transactions for the amount of data being moved around.
EDIT: There's also this, which is a little older, but we know there's been at least 1tx/sec for over a year

There is much more physical infrastructure that has been invested in to support BTC: PoS terminals, ATMs, etc.. Other coins do not have this. BTC is a payment system, and that's the attraction to the mainstream consumer. This gives BTC a backbone, a solid foundation, that is a physical investment which cannot be easily ditched in favor of a new coin. No other coin has the physical infrastructure that BTC does. This, to my mind, along with the notoriety and widespread awareness of its existence as *the* crypto is what it has over anything else.
Also, a random Pastebin post from months ago and a sourceless image are the entire origin of this shift. Word will spread that it's a dump, and people will get nervous, see the low price of BTC, and jump back. We'll probably see the price fluctuate for some time, ebb and flow, between the two.
The most interesting thing of all about this whole deal is that BTCs losses do not mirror BCH's gains. BCH doubled, on it's way to tripling? Well BTC hasn't even halved yet - that tells you it has more going on for it than how much money people have in it.

BCC simply increasing blocksizes will never scale to even a fraction of bank/cc transactions:
MasterCard does 74 billion transactions a year:
    74,000,000,000 / 365 = 202,739,726 tx/day
    202,739,726 / 24hrs = 8,447,488 tx/hour
    8,447,488 / 60min = 140,791 tx/min
    140,791 / 60sec = 2346 tx/sec
To scale BCC from 24 tx/sec to 2400 tx/sec you'd need blocks that are 100x bigger, or 800mb. LOL

    3.456tb/month = 1261.44tb/year
1.26144 petabytes a year the blockchain would grow, if you could even manage everybody broadcasting 80mb/minute, or 1.33mb per second. China didn't want to see the blocksize increase beyond 1mb for a long time because their interwebz infrastructure couldn't sustain more than that.

bitcoin can be as anonymous as cash if you want it to be, and anybody with internet access can have a bitcoin wallet. so... simply?


treating bitcoin as a commodity is *exactly* what I was referring to when I mentioned that people are "missing the point" of bitcoin by investing in it, because it's *not* a conventional currency. pretending it is doesn't make it so. you can *try* to make money doing this, but I wouldn't personally because, as I stated before, the good old days of btc volatility are gone. again, bitcoin is a transaction system, that is its true value and utility. btc itself is just the means, like poker chips in a casino.
if the only reason anybody ever bought bitcoin at all was merely to invest in it and try to make money off its increasing value, it would be worthless. because the market would serve no purpose whatsoever other than selling hot air, like beanie babies. people bought tons of beanie babies thinking they were going to be worth a lot of money someday, and they never amounted to anything.
as far as I'm concerned, it is the mainstream ignorant types who invest in bitcoin for this purpose, and aren't actually helping its adoption as a means of payment, which is the whole point of bitcoin! what gives bitcoin value at all is the exchange of bitcoin for actual goods and services, therefore, that is what the focus should be.
the odds are, everybody who is still holding a bunch of btc in the hopes of making money and walk away feeling like they were super smart for investing in this new-fangled-techno-thingy is just going to lose money, or break even if they are lucky.
the reality is that the ones who stand to make real money are the ones who promote bitcoin's use in day to day life by creating systems and services that facilitate its use. *that* is a wise investment.

I envision blockchain technology being adopted by banks, and there being multiple cryptocurrencies (maybe one for each bank) and they will all be interchangeable via exchange services that are seamless and transparent to the user (with exception of fluctuating exchange rates themselves). At the end of the day, what will happen is that these banking institutions will set it up so that people's public address on the blockchains will be tied to their identity, just like existing bank accounts are supposed to be.
@_date: 2015-09-24 05:13:30
bitcoin is simply not that volatile anymore because of it's relatively widespread adoption.. and it wouldn't drop in value that much that quickly. the reality is that anybody investing in BTC as a commodity that they hope to make money off of is clearly missing the true value of it (which is purely functional) because it will never 'take off' again and have a drastic increase in value like it did two years ago when it became known among the mainstream.
when people begin abandoning bitcoin it will be gradual, not sudden. there is a lot of infrastructure and investment in bitcoin, but the trend is set by those who know the true application of bitcoin: anonymous, global, and decentralized currency transactions.
*that* is common sense.
fearmongering is lazy.

yea, and it has its flaws and issues and there are definite worthy contenders and all it takes is someone like coinbase to come along and try to hog the whole deal for people to get a bad taste in their mouth and move on to whatever is inherently better in design. in the meantime, with how established bitcoin is, it will reign supreme for the interim.
what makes bitcoin so attractive in the first place is that not one single entity is in charge of it or dictates how it is used. once that becomes encroached upon, people will simply migrate away..
think of bitcoin as the myspace of digital transactions. the facebook of digital transactions is due to come along in the next year or so.

not an exact transaction fee if that's what's supposed to be shown, you can find the transaction or group of recent transactions with that same fee and see all the addresses involved.

How does the 12-word key help me if it's only generating private keys internally on blockchain.info, and I never get my hands on them? EDIT: *with regards to a fork
Also, if people have to buy a hardware wallet to use bitcoin then it's never going to succeed.

Sure, *BTC* forks, but not completely different blockchain tech that's entirely independent of bitcoin altogether.
EDIT: In other words not all automobiles are powered by American-made motors, even if they were the only ones on the market at one time. Independent minds pursue independent ventures.

Keep in mind that the initial projections for the 2nd halvening were for November of this year.
The difficulty could cause it to go either way - blocks could consistently be mined faster than the target of 10 minutes, or slower - as an overall average. It's not *perfectly* ten minutes per block, nor is it even perfectly ten minutes per block on average, the system just tries to approach it by re-targeting the difficulty as you stated. I'm more inclined to believe that with more mining power constantly coming online that the difficulty will always be behind and blocks will consistently be mined faster than the intended ten minutes a piece.
Re-targeting should take this into account by extrapolating the mining power added over the previous two weeks to try to guess where the mining power will be over the course of the following two weeks. If the mining power stops growing then after those two weeks it will re-target and be about as accurate as you can get. This is the only way to get as close to 10 minutes as possible.
So, no, it does not guarantee that it will take ten minutes. If you suddenly doubled the mining power on the network the block time would be cut in half for two weeks (if it were doubled immediately after the last difficulty retarget).
The bottom half of this page  shows more increases in difficulty than decreases. In an ideal world there would be a mix of both red and green (increases and decreases), which would indicate that the system is setting the difficulty as intelligently as possible by not lagging behind. On the same page you can see that the average time per block is less than ten minutes - and these stats are for the last 504 blocks, which is about 3.5 days.
The chart halfway down shows 'Bitcoin Block Generation Time vs Difficulty', and you can see that the time for discovering a new block hangs out just under 10 minutes for almost all of the past two months. This is what caused the halvening to jump from November to July.
...*but*, maybe the rate of growth as a fraction of the total mining power will decrease, closing the gap on the mining power vs targeted difficulty that I just described. So maybe my prediction is way off and it will actually be closer to the intended 4 years between reward halvings.
Thanks for your reply.

I didn't realize blockchain.info was an exchange, but I did realize that it abstracted away access to private keys - and that was back when forking was a non-issue.

It's not 'supported' by the banks when they are using their own modified Ethereum and blockchains, rendering all your arguments against ether that concern banks irrelevant.
The reason they're using Ethereum instead of Bitcoin is because of expanded functionality beyond mere currency - otherwise they would've used bitcoin. Obviously they're interested in the potential for blockchain technology to change how the instruments of banking work fundamentally - with smart contracts and distributed apps.

Lol. They may as well keep trying to fight cryptography. So I guess gold and silver are going to be outlawed too eh? If you ask me, our stupid corrupt POS country is trying to drive itself into the ground, far beyond third-worldom.
EDIT: I also think this is a bit of fear-mongering. The amount of money, resources, manpower, etc.. that it will require to enforce anything concerning cryptocurrencies is virtually a black hole of diminishing returns. Yes, the corrupt head-in-clouds morons in DC who are completely out of touch with the lives of the people who are actually creating progress are going to continue deluding themselves into believing they're still building the best country on earth, while they corner themselves into their own fantasy ivory tower and alienate the populous and rest of the world. Keep on keeping on (i.e. hodl onto all the things you know to be good and true) and eventually their boolshite will come to pass as a big fat stupid mistake, either by NK/Iran/ISIS obliterating their asses, specifically, or by the people themselves overrunning their perversion of government which has ultimately realized itself as a mere exercise in futility. Murphy's law said so.

It's an inside joke, referencing some drunken/typo rant on some old forum post where some guy supposedly mispelled 'hold' and typed 'hodl'.. It has since flourished and blossomed as a legitimate cryptocurrency term unto itself. You can goggle it.
