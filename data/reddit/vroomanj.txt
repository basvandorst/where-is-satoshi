The block just contains transactions I believe.
Corrected to start at block 0 and added note about reward halving exactly every 210,000 blocks.

I quite enjoyed these reads:

What's the benefit to a direct share versus a PT other than taking out the added risk of the middle man? Is there any?
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:02:11
Yeah, I have seen at least 1 or 2 posts about people receiving their products from e4btc.
Unfortunately, trust is a big issue with bitcoin companies. To some extent we have to give them a chance or we will never know. If we don't give them a chance then we will not see bitcoin startups succeed which is bad for bitcoin. That being said, perhaps it is best to start with small purchases :P

Thanks. Wasn't a fan of that article. I feel it was flawed in a number of ways. For instance it looks at bitcoin as an asset rather than a currency. Bitcoin is no more valueLESS than any other fiat currency. Only bitcoin does have a unique value in that the abilities it promises to deliver to the average Joe are revolutionary. It also doesn't even acknowledge any of the reasons why bitcoin might be adopted. You probably think I am just a bitcoin fanboy but that's simply not true. While I would love to see bitcoin succeed I am not certain bitcoin is the coin that will succeed but I do believe bitcoin as a payment system, a protocol, it's APIs, etc. is revolutionary and will eventually be adopted in some fashion or another.

Wait what!? I just checked and now it will let me. Why wouldn't it let me the other day? :P

I'm really bummed. I was just getting started with Bitcoin and was just getting to the point where I was starting to feel like I was finally starting to build some up :( It was just like just under .2 Bitcoin but it is really a bummer. I should have known an online wallet wasn't a good idea but I hadn't educated myself enough to feel safe storing them myself. It seemed like a popular site and an interesting concept. Guess I'm lucky I learned my lesson with a small amount at least. Not sure I want to bother starting to build it up again. The excitement I felt before has now been drained.

The site coming under attack shouldn't matter... there are all kinds of backup options available to you in just 1 click. Just keep it backed up.

I ordered one a few months before everyone started getting really up in arms over BFL (probably almost exactly a year ago). I received it last week. At this point I have it running just because really. I like contributing in some way. Don't really need profit. I didn't spend all that much. Currently getting about 8.2 Gh/s.

Coinbase is safe. Very slow but safe.
EDIT: I've only used it to purchase Bitcoin. Not to store Bitcoin.

This might be a stupid question but is a distributed blockchain an option?
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:05:55
I follow you completely but this leads me to another question: If Bitcoin is not considered a currency how does the tax man place a value on a Bitcoin? And as an extension, how do they tax something with undetermined actual value?

I don't follow and I want to... How can each person both have complete control over their legal circumstances without being forced to accept laws by the voting collective AND be subject to law, rights protection, dispute resolution, and modern division of labor, etc?
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:33:04
Thank you sir! Didn't think to go to the order form :P derp
EDIT: OP it would be nice if fees were explained better on your main page.

I would really like to get your design on something like the polymer that the Canadians use for their bills. Any thoughts on selling premade templates? I'm not entirely sure where I would get polymer paper like that I guess.

I read various websites and the quote I chose was simply because it was a well written summary of what I had found at various sites on Google. My point was that I trust 50 websites on Google more than 1 guy on reddit and that clearly there is contention (religious debate) on the topic when he said there is none. I don't care which of the 2 are right. I was just pointing out that it is more debated than he says.

Do you already have bitcoin?
If so, the easiest bitcoin asset exchange to deposit into would probably be 
BitFunder is kind of a pain because you have to setup a WeExchange account as well to deposit your bitcoin in.
If you need to buy bitcoin as well then it is probably a trickier question. If so, what country do you live in?

Anyone care to expand on this?
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:08:02
I'm notorious for using excessive amounts of exclamation points so I can't talk. So your title sucks, who cares? :P
Admittedly I am pretty excited at the possibility of being able to make my Amazon purchases with bitcoin so I will likely be giving your service a try in the near future.
Question though: How do you make money from this service? Are there fees involved? I am assuming there must be but I wasn't able to find anything on your site.
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:14:08
Great! Love it. So where can I get a physical one made on credit card plastic or similar? :P
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:03:46
I like this idea. How do we make this happen? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:54:17
Yeah... the title was terrible but I still found value in the read so I guess I don't regret it.
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:24:03
Already been through all that. I'm hoping for interesting reads similar to:

Basically, no one loses ever until people stop paying into it. So in a sense it is a pyramid scheme but even if you lose you become the seed for the next tree and if people keep using it you will make your money back then.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:48:16
Haven't made many purchases but they have been fine for me so far as well. Not a fan of this 30 day waiting period for instant transactions. Sad thing is I have another account I had forgotten about but at this point I have already added my info to the new one and I am feeling lazy :P
EDIT: Not saying I don't understand the waiting period. Just bummed that it has to exist.

Can I just point out that Mac vs. PC is entirely like a religious debate. They are both wrong.
Also: A simple Google search suggests you are wrong. It is very much a religious debate. The general consensus of a simple Google search went something like this: "Using both technical and fundamental research is therefore a more sound strategy to get an overall picture of a company's security."
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:10:11
Are there any ideas as to how we might circumvent this hurdle at present?
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:37:59
Yes, it is SORT OF a pyramid scheme from which you can withdraw at anytime. You just have to survive 2 rounds to profit 6.25%. So ideally the tree keeps growing and people get out once they have made a profit. Or they can keep risking it.
