never said it was. you post actually is pretty invalid. the price of bitcoin is absolutely everything regardless of your motives for buying it. if bitcoin didn't have a price it would essentially be worthless. do you understand now?

no there isn't

well some people are still teenagers mentally or physically so I guess you're right...

is that seriously a big deal? you can get that same payout in one hand of blackjack.

most people that bring the price down are early adopters or miners selling blocks of 500+ coins at a time. I don't think they're weak, in fact they're the ones who are smart enough to take liquidity when they can get it.
something bitcoiners don't get yet: liquidity is worth paying for.

the problem I have with this snarky little argument is that sure, USD and BTC are both used in crimes. However, when you purchase BTC you (yes you) are providing much needed liquidity to the people who profit from these crimes. If there wasn't somebody there to buy bitcoins (and raise the price) criminals wouldn't have any way to profit, and the same goes for holding/hoarding bitcoins. The same CANNOT be said about USD. Simply holding or acquiring USD will not support the black market in any way/shape/form. Every time you buy a bitcoin you are ensuring that a silk road drug dealer has a market to unload on.
think about it for a while.

no, its not absurd at all. your comparison to the gas market is the absurd one. if you weren't there buying bitcoins then drug dealers wouldn't have a market to unload their coins on to. this is not up for debate. this is an absolute fact.

glad you feel that way because there are a ton of bitcoins that are still waiting to be sold to any buyer at any price

ok...doesn't make what I said any less true.

"if you're upset about major unpredictable fluctuations in your commodities buying power then you are bitcoining wrong"
do you realize how stupid this topic is OP? bitcoin is 100% about its price. if it didn't have one, you wouldn't be able to buy stuff with it, making it completely useless.

if you're not worried about the money then why aren't you buying now?
