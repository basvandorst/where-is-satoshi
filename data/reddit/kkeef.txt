Education and healthcare are also prototypical examples of "cost disease" - it seems likely they would rise under almost any monetary policy. I totally agree though, that policy is encouraging this even more than might have otherwise happened.

There are also wallets that store private keys on your computer. Greater risk of personal hack, but zero risk of exchange hack. Electrum is nice. I think this is a reasonable option for smaller amounts of btc.

I agree with your sentiment but history might not agree with you very consistently on that one. :-)

I'm positive about bitcoin in the face of regulation, too, but I don't think the government would lose legitimacy for attempting to regulate.
 Most of the people into bitcoin already deny its legitimacy, and most of the people not into it will just eat up what the gov says. 
Maybe a few people will have their minds changed, though.

Good point. When I first saw this service people were clearing orders with discounts as high as 30% which colored my impression - I haven't interacted with the site recently.

Sorry.

This person is right to some extent. There would be many more exchanges if we had a free market. The friction between USD and BTC is largely due to all of the legal barriers. 
The risk of failing firms is certainly a feature of a free market, but we're not in a free market, and barriers to entry for exchanges and brokers create an artificially narrow range of competitors.

Some critical number of stupid people would be pretty useful for actually changing things. At least in terms of some widespread civil disobedience.

This works because people are willing to commit credit card fraud to buy bitcoins below market rate. The price doesn't matter if you are spending someone else's money.

My company used bip70 to split a payment between multiple recipients, but not to add more outputs in the name of obfuscation. One problem is that there are lots of wallets that still don't support bips 70-73.

I know, but it's useful for lots of stuff, including conducting electricity. Just a joke :)

"changing the world" were the words you used, which is very different from progress sometimes.

I suspect many insurers would insist people get vaccinated. Various places of business may require proof of insurance. Even in the current world there are a handful of transactions that require proof of vaccination, so that response isn't completely unfeasible. At minimum TheGreatRoh could make efforts to reduce his contact with unvaccinated folks, although I agree it's unrealistic to expect to avoid contact with the unvaccinated completely.

Collectively, the mistakes of the individuals in charge are amplified to effect an entire population. 
What makes you think lawmakers will be different? You haven't addressed the circular nature of the argument.

So let's let a group of illogical (and particularlly sociopathic) people make rules for everyone.

Yeah I hadn't really run the numbers at all to figure out plausible outputs.
If the $1 figure is reasonable then maybe the chip costs more than the value it will produce, even with free electricity. I guess we'll see what happens when they try to roll this stuff out.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:51:30
But then you need the consumer to pay you for the bitcoins somehow. 
If they simply mine them it's invisible to the end user without requiring outlays from someone's hotwallet to fund all the devices. It may be more expensive but it's a different 'who' that's paying, and the consumer is 'paying' without having to plug in a debit card number or exchange fiat in some fashion, they just use some power.

Bitcoin, physical bullion, and custodied gold - you should check out digitaltangibletrust.com for large volume trades.

I doubt they expect it's more profitable than the electricity. The point is that devices get more value out of having btc built-in than simply the value of the satoshis themselves. I think it's much less about profit than it is about convenience.

I'm just trying to draw attention to the circular nature of the argument from irrationality. If the argument is that people can't be trusted, then you also can't trust whoever would make the rules for the very same reason.

They can sell dollars for a sizable profit back in Argentina because of the capital controls - there is a premium paid for USD that is not matched when attempting to sell bitcoin down there.
