I'm shorting b1t stock right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:56:47
I don't know what's bizarre about that idea.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:06:41
Weak. Come back when you get 1000% increase in a year.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:11:25
Don't act like that is the highest inflation we have seen.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:16:35
I find the chart of [interest rates]( even more effective. That little rally near the end looks like someone's arm reaching out just before he dies.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:03:34


Why not?
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:30:58
You can make a lot more with altcoins if you time it right. You probably shouldn’t try it if you’re a Billy though.
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:57:05
I'm pretty sure most people on this sub still think it's the future.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:33:04
Nice. Why is there such a rough road to 2X city though?
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:26:39
What fees would Litecoin have if it had the same transaction volume as Bitcoin though?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:05:04
You can't implement Lightning Network on BCH, right? In that case it will never see mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:00:05
That makes sense. So is there a segment of Bitcoiners who want to avoid 2X and use Lightning Network to solve scaling problems instead? Would that work in the long run?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:36:09
*Bitcoin* could potentially drop to almost zero at some point, but it's very unlikely that cryptocurrencies as a whole will die since they have unique properties that no other currency has. Bitcoin currently has a huge mindshare and network effect though.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:15:06
I remember a few years back how the most common argument for using Bitcoin seemed to be "low fees". I was wondering if anyone even gave a fuck about that, it's not like I see the fees I pay when I buy something using my debit card.

If you come across Derren Brown, run like hell!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:49:30
And you don't think they will panic if/when Bitcoin corrects after the fork?
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:33:12
My dick
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:09:40
Nah, you should listen to people, then do the opposite of what they say :)
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:07:53
They don’t need to do a bail-in. They can just print more dollars.
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:09:25
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-04-01 10:10:34
Isn’t collecting interest on a Bitcoin loan essentially the same as taking a salary? Except the ’job’ here is simply to provide capital.
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:56:59
Not me. It's about what I expect from the average person ��
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:11:54
If and when the dollar goes into hyperinflation it's going to happen over many years so you'll have plenty of time to make a decision. And we could be decades from that happening.

He knew that an 8000% rally must end at some point.
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:41:33
There's no proof required since it's just a baseless claim from the author of the article. But the actual source is from January 2018 so he at least sold before the major bear market happened.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:10:11
This will inevitable happen no matter what. The question is whether we transition to a similar system or to a cryptocurrency system.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:35:43
I think Gold is a good idea, but the premine thing has probably doomed it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:51:36
I'm hyped for Bitcoin 2 Extreme Turbo Edition, but I'll wait until I can get all the DLC in the Crypto of the Year Edition.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:01:37
And I think your comment is cringey.
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:07:02
Here's a tip: Get a job.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:39:48
Is that a tentacle down there?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:43:21
We still need banks to be able to take loans though.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:50:24
Ok, I wasn’t aware that trading fiat currencies was already restricted. In that case I guess buying Bitcoin makes some sense.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:57:44
So in uncertain times they should make risky investments? Sorry, that doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:00:08
Is it common to buy a house you can't really afford and just let inflation eliminate the debt?
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:55:29
Congrats, you'll be richer than your parents in a few years ;)
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:46:06
Yeah, I’m sure the iranians are buying Bitcoin because they fear war ��
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:47:28
Brb. Taking out a mortgage on my house to buy Hoaxchain.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:49:09
I think Exodus is pretty neat.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:49:20
Ok, but the rest of us live in the real world.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:47:18
If crypto ownership becomes punishable by death then we will have way bigger problems to worry about. Like a fascist state that puts people to death on a whim.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:28:29
Agreed. Did I do it right?
