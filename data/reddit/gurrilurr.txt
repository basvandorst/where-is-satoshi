Alot of new money started to come in when the big banks announced cash based bitcoin futures are going to start trading this weekend. I'd say this has caused somewhat of increase in volatility during the past few days.

Understand that on the stockmarket you are lucky if it moves 3% during the entire day.
Imagine then a market that moves 15% up and down in the matter of hours and on top of that never closes. A traders wet dream.

blaming the late adopters who went in big like 2 days ago looking for a fast buck and panicing as soon as the bar turned red.

The idea of bitcoin is not to trade it and get rich fast. Read up on crypto currency, what it is and the idea behind it instead.

Before MtGox went tits up, they had arround 70% of the bitcoin exchange in the World. Just saying.

Arround 600k coins are still missing from the MtGox hack. Thats alot. Imagine if someone with that amount decide to unload them all at an exchange at once.

Gdax often rejects your order if its to close to the market price.
Edit: not as a default, but chanses are that your order becomes a taker order and there for gets redjected.

Spoofing (making orders with no intent to execute) is also very common so the support leves we see is fake to some extent.
