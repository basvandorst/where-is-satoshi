Bitcoin-Qt keeps the private keys to 100 addresses in the wallet. Every time you "generate" a new one it is taken from that pool. I don't know for sure when this pool gets refilled. So you should create a backup every time you add a new address to the ones you can see.
This has nothing to do with the number of transactions you sent. Every time you send Coins from one of your addresses this address' private key is used to sign the transaction.
Side note: You don't have direct control over which addresses are being used for sending. If you received 1BTC via address A and 0.5BTC via address B and send 0.5BTC the client doesn't necessarily use address B for that. It always tries to keep the transaction's "size" as small as possible in order to minimize fees.

As with any other exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:52:18
That's a really good idea. And it's quite easy to implement as well. All you need is a server that checks your email account via IMAP and automatically responds with the address it generates for every possible spammer. Even a personal solution would be quite cheap since a Raspberry Pi would have no problem dealing with these tasks.
One problem I see with it however is that you're locking yourself out of registering for any service that sends you an email with an activation code. In most cases you don't know exactly from which address these are going to come so you need a way of remotely disarming the spam blocker. This interface could be an attractive attack vector to your server.
If enough people use your method, ad delivery services will quickly pop up, collect payload and burst it through the one address they paid for. Then you'd have to increase the price per whitelist entry and quickly your Raspberry Pi would need a lot more security to make sure you can actually pay back legitimate contacts without their deposit being stolen while they wait for you to react.
Some of these problems could be solved by a centralized service to whom you give your email service credentials. Yeah... No need to go over the many reasons why this is a bad idea in detail. Apart from those you can expect them to break down pretty quickly and add "verified trusted certified special *add some more bullshit* partners" to your whitelist if they pay a flat rate to the service provider.
After writing all this off the top of my head I'm not sure anymore if I've made more arguments for or against your idea.

So you mean a blockchain.info wallet. Should've said that. blockchain.info is small company compared to the whole userspace of Bitcoin and its blockchain and they're not necessarily 100% representative of the rest of the community. So mixing up the two is generally a bad idea, especially since it might just go down. Which brings me to your question:
You're relying on the technical abilities and honesty of someone don't even know. Bitcoin enables you to get rid of this unhealthy dependence. Take control over your private keys, otherwise you're basically opening up a bank account with all its disadvantages.
There is a lot of wallet software around that lets you do this. Mycelium(Android) and the Bitcoin Core client(any desktop OS) are two examples. But keep in mind that a wallet on a device that's connected to the internet should be viewed as secure as your physical wallet in your pocket. Keep amounts you wouldn't want to carry around all day if you had them in paper money in cold storage. Redundant encrypted paper wallets are a very secure way to do this.
But before you do anything: Read up on it yourself! Refer to several sources. Your friend might be an idiot, I might be someone trying to lure you into his evil plan. Just take responsibility for yourself.

No, it's a fee of around 0.46EUR.
bitcoin.de is not a live trading exchange like most others but rather a mediator with escrow. They hold the coins and keep 1% of what they take out of the sellers account when transferring it to the buyer. The buyer's direct bank transfer to the seller is to be reduced by 0.5%.
So buyer and seller have each paid a fee of 0.5% without bitcoin.de having to interfere with the fiat transaction.
Side note: Since traders can pick any offer and sometimes have further criteria (such as rating or bank of the partner) for which one they want to accept beyond the price, bitcoinde mostly looks weird in bitcoinity and regularly messes with its market depth display.

Only because vanitygen doesn't support mining for the last characters doesn't mean nobody implemented that feature.
But I don't think it's currently feasible to brute-force for an address that could trick most people within the delay you can set up before a user waiting for a payment service's response becomes unpredictable and might refresh the page or even close the tab. An attacker would have to spin up his victim's GPU and display a "Please wait.." spinny graphic that matches the spoofed site's design **in the browser**.

What you're suggesting comes very close to putting serial numbers on items.

That sounds like an interesting art project:
A website streaming the Bitcoin blockchain as music:
Convert the recently broadcast block into a 10min audio file. After applying some filters of course so it doesn't sound like a CD-ROM played on a audio CD player, of course.
Should the next block not be ready after 10mins play a prepared eery music peace "Silence of the miners". If the current block song gets cut short play a record scratch sound and start the script from the beginning.
One could even encode any kind of metadata into acoustic stimuli so after some training listeners could instictively know what's currently going on in the network.

I assume the article arbitrarily refers to addresses which have been referenced in the blockchain. If you look at addresses which are valid the percentage is much much lower. When talking about addresses that someone holds the key to it's still much lower.
The clickbait they're probably going for is wealth concentration and the system being "in control" of a handful of people. No.
In the very beginning all Bitcoin in existence was concentrated in one address. Thanks to user-friendly wallets and openly available thought-through payment and donation APIs address reuse is declining. So the statistic which was chosen here because it is so easy to create will yield a lower and lower percentage the later it is invoked.

You yes, but not everyone. So when one party aggregates a lot of hashing power without increasing the global hashrate they increase their block rate but it remains at around 10/min network-wide.

No, no and no.
Also having 51% of the total network hashrate doesn't let you solve blocks any faster. You only find more blocks than everyone else. Total hashrate increasing to 1000% would give average block solution durations of 1min, but only for about a day.

Bitcoin addresses have a checksum. Randomly changing one or even a handful of characters will most likely not result in a valid address. Plus a space is not a valid character for a Bitcoin address.
Every half-decent wallet software will check the receiving address for validity before broadcasting the transaction. And even if yoir client neglected to do so, you'd still not lose any money because miners would reject the invalid transaction.
So the most likely scenario is that your client did what it considered most convenient for you and safely eliminated any whitespace in the receiving address before building the transaction. Whether this is a desirable feature or not is up for hours of debate somewhere else.
Check a block explorer like blockr.io or blockchain.info by entering the receiving address and you'll probably see your transaction, now that some time has passed maybe even with one or two confirmations.
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:55:53
The dice site you're trying to screw over doesn't have to wait for your ingoing transaction to be confirmed when they use your payment's input as output for sending you the winnings.

Yes, the lower the total network hashrate the higher your probability per Hash/s to solve a block for 25BTC(1). But this probability is directly dependent on the current mining difficulty which is periodically adapted to the block rate by the network(2) every 2016 blocks which translates to around two weeks. This way it is ensured that on average about every 10 minutes a block is found.
Should your hypothetical drastic reduction in network hashrate happen directly after a retarget it would take much longer than two weeks for the difficulty to adjust:
We are currently at about 1.3EHash/s. Let's assume a sudden drop to 1GHash/s. That would statistically reduce the block rate from 10min to 10min\*(1.3e18/1e9)=24733a (Yes, that's *years*.)
Luckily to wipe out this much hashing power all at once would take a catastrophic event that would probably also wipe out most human if not all life on earth. In this case we'd have different things to worry about than keeping a civilized global society running.

Cold storage protects you from theft:
Generate new address on a computer that never goes online, encrypt the private key (with 7-Zip for example)and store it in a few safe locations. Paint a QR code of it on your house for example or - just as safe - upload it to Dropbox.
You can then use this private key's address as your savings account. If you ever want to spend the money on it you can import the private key to any wallet or use offline transaction signing software to "withdraw" only part of it.

In case you don't have that much fun programming things yourself: You'll probably find someone to do it for you for under 50USD.

Apart from wanting others to benefit from "that awesome new thing" we know about there are also quite egoistic motivations in promoting Bitcoin: The more people use it, the faster its acceptance and usability but also value rises.

People in a cult desperately try to substitute what's missing in their lives with faith in fake promises and they finally believe it strong enough to think no one should be without what they seem to have.
Our conviction - sometimes even obession - stems from sober-minded analysis and partly being fed up with what's becoming of society. Nothing wrong with that.

As soon as you use the backup wallet with a new client it will simply check the in- and outputs for all addresses whose private keys are stored in the wallet.dat and show you the wallet's balance. This data is stored in the blockchain.
You can receive and send as much as you want and your backup stays valid. Only if you add new addresses to the wallet you have to make a new backup.
(The keypool is stored in the wallet.dat and normally contains up to 100 addresses the user doesn't see yet. But you can't tell from the GUI if a new address has been taken from the pool or newly generated.)

I didn't know they already shipped anything. What devices do you have? Do you have pictures?

Yes, you can withdraw your coins to any wallet immediately via a normal Bitcoin transaction.

They got a budget for advertising, too:

"more user-friendly" seems to imply that Bitcoin-Qt wasn't user-friendly enough.

Looks more like 2k to me...

Where are you from? Maybe someone wants to sell to you in person.

It's called vanitygen and quite a tedious mining task.

My EUR withdrawals come with a delay for a few months now. Usually takes them about a month to start the SEPA transaction.

Bitcoin-Qt is user-friendly for everyone. Advanced features like the one you used are hidden so inexperienced users won't stumble into screwing up their wallets. If you want to use such a feature you have to learn how it works and where to find it first. Don't blame the software for your neglect to read up on whaf you're doing.

No no no no no no no! No.

I'm experiencing similar delays for SEPA withdrawals.

That's what I did the first time, too.
If you want to import multiple addresses you can do so with
importprivkey "some account name" false
This way no rescan will occur for the imported private key and you can manually trigger it when finished importing.

Scroll through the list of addresses in your client and count at what position the address to be removed is located. Then open your wallet.dat in Notepad and remove the according lines:
Each address is represented by five lines in the wallet file. So if you would want to remove the second address you'd have to remove lines 6 to 10.
