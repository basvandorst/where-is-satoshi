Many sites only let's you do a small first pursue. If you used a stolen credit card the loss is not to big.

I for one cant wait to se the dramatisation of Satoshi Nakamoto life, when it is release in 2030.

Wait, we have the same dad?
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:52:05
I support this, I had a similar idéa. 
There could be an option to give a small amount similar to the transaction fee to the development team every time you bought a product/service to the core development team.

This might be more relevant than i first thought. Other digital asset can have value. Many are harder to put on objective value on.
What about online game character that took 500h to make and people sell on auctions for a decent amount. More and more digital things will have a value in the future.

What a downvote?!? My plan has failed. nooooooo
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:24:52
 is the real site.
However I dont think these sites ar fraud, you pay them to do some of the work and possibly resubmit the application for you every year.

I would asume that you must report everything of value and  bank records going back 1-2 years to get welfare.

No, sins this is not in the proposed agreement.
I I would bet 300 BTC I  would not agree to clause like that.  You ar allowed to use all legal means to manipulate the assets. 
So lets short sell 5000  NYSE:BRK.A

But you would only need to have this amount looked until 1-3 confirmations are made unless you have 1 million simultaneous transaktions going on.

Apple, google etc other should come to gather and say that there will be no mobile phones etc from then in UK. Sure it will cost them in the short run but it must be done. 
I dint think they will lose that much money sins people will delay their purchases.  
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:20:19
yahh, using an escrow service you know you cant trust sins it is not an public entity to avoid the risk of sending money to a seller you do not know is kinda stupid when you think trough.
Luckily my ethanol supplier is trustworthy.

tl;dr: This should be handled in exactly the same way as if it was regular cash or stolen items.  
Lets say that a portion of the stolen is deposited at some exchanges and they are certain that they are stolen what should be done?
The bitcoins are clearly illegal in the sense they have been used in criminal activity so the rightful owners cant come forward and claim them. Exchanges must follow the laws in the counties they operate in and sins they rely on banking system similar money laundering / know your customer laws should apply.
The local governments where the exchanges operate should probably force the exchanges to hand the stolen bitcoins over the authorities just as that would if someone tries to exchange stolen cash/gold/items etc. 
The person who deposited them will be treated in the same way as anyone who try to deposit tainted cash or pawn stolen items.
If he did not know it was stolen, then get it back else same procedure as anyone accused of Handling stolen goods. Sins a public ledger is used it might be easier prove prove either story.

And why would he not sign the message with his PGP key?
If you cant cryptographically prove who you are you don't exist.

I doubt you get VISA/nastercard/amex to sign on this this idea. Even I you get a merchant account it would be quickly canceled.
Having chargebacks as a business model is likely fraud. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:24:23
Depends on the system, having to refill it with coins all the time  is expensive. You would need bills and coins in different dominations.
I have newer sen it here. One different thing I have sees is a button where you can donate the money instead of getting a  receipt.

Shouldn't possession of one of these outside ISIS aria be confirmation that you in some way support ISIS?
Even  if you buy it for fun on the second market, i assume you will not be able to but it directly you are funding ISIS.
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:11:35
It would be theoretically possibly for a customer to return just one can and have btc cent to a wallet so you dont have to get the receipt an go to the register to get your 10 cent. 
Sending you regular money would not work due to fees.
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:04:20
Is this new to you? We have had it in Sweden for at least 30 years.
Edit: No one pays you to recycle glass/aluminum/pet the customer pays an extra fee when they buy the product and just get the money back when returning the  can.
Edit: 1984 was this system introduced here.

Bitcoin started at 2 pizzas for 10 000 btc. You have to start at the first transaction. 
I am not sure that was the first transaction but you get the point.
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:21:28
Probably 80% likelihood it is one of these, or a few others. It is unlikely there is a genius put there who no one knows about.
This person has an incredibly strong character who manages not to show his wealth (one million + BTC).

In June 2011 i bought 400oz silver (think this was the minimum buy to get a low markup) I was considering buying BTC but I did not want to pay 15% percent or whatever over spot for 1 oz coins. I have a small amount of regret over this.

Lp cant get elected becuse Dem and Rep has created rules that make it almost impossible to get elected as a 3rd party. Ross Perot got a bit to close in 1992 so They! made it imposible for anyone else to get close in the future.

I wonder if Satoshi ever pgp signed his mail. If he did he could accept it anonymously and ask them to donate it to X.
Satoshi has about a billion dollars worth of bitcoin today according to an calculation I saw some time ago. Se he has little need for the money that comes with the price.
@_date: 2013-09-22 10:24:59
Is thus due to banking regulations and USD?
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:47:59
For the rest of us it is a good thing when BTC are lost. I wonder how many BTC there will be in circulation in 2140. 20 900 000? 17 000 000?
Assuming BTC becomes the new world gold standard.

ChatSecure is a good one . It uses OTR and works on Google, Jabber and Bonjour.
Cryptochat probably exist on android but on Security now thay said that it had some serious flaws.
OTR (Off the record) exist natively in Adium for mac or as a plugin to Pidgin for win.

ohh, i thought it would grow faster and faster. 52GB per year is nothing, a couple of hunderd million people can easily run a super node with this data in the future.

I heard a lot about this but I have not understood the root cause.
Is it due to mt.gox cheepnes , bad ted technology or
government regulation where they are? 
What are the average times on the different exchanges to deposit and withdraw?

For me Gresham's law is applicable here, unless I get a rebate i will spend fiat. My strategy is at the end of a month never have less BTC then I had in the begining.
