It is relatively stable.... And it doesn't matter if it doesn't work now. We are buying the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:29:34
What is the amount and tx fee
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:01:01
It will be fine. It will confirm sooner or later. If it drops from the mempool open a ticket with purse.io and have them resubmit it, or have them RFB.
Or pay a TX accelerator.
Consider your fee level before sending it. Otherwise it's just spam.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:48:17
Western union is not decentralized. Not the networks fault you paid a low fee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:09:12
Guys you are missing the point where your salary is paid in the LN. Problem solved in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:39:32
Yes it did. No block increase. It will hurt LN adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:45:25
Lol. Yeah that's never getting confirmed. Fees are around 500 to 700.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:26:24
Yes small tx is spam right now. Congestion.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:29:13
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:19
No. Not an issue. You need to hold on and wait. If you can't wait or LN or pay the fee you should not be in btc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:03:35
They need to subsidized Gdax transfers. It's how we all send BTC since no fees. Better coinbase suckers pay for it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:38:00
The network is doing it as Designed. There is a $50 toll tax. Anyone who has a low priority transaction won't be able to get on the highway. They are poor and should wait for LN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:43:47
Healthy fee. Any TXs not in this fee range right now is spam. Don't spam the network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:50:37
Protest by not using these companies for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:25:33
Yes, that's wht they are working on a 3rd layer on top of LN. Should work similar to a checking account at a bank that you can pay a fee for them to have liquidity into the 2nd layer to transact on the expensive 1st layer at a billion users.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:39:34
Try the TX accelerator first. Should of paid double that fee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:17:26
Yes. Anyone who can't afford the fees shouldn't be using btc anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:47:35
It's fine just wait or use a TX accelerator. At that fee level you are definitely going to time out. 2 weeks or so.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:49:12
Hey. You are buying the future of btc. It is not working for low fee TXs right now. Wait for LN and it will work again. Easy!
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:12:35
No. Stay with BTC. It's just not for buying coffee right now. Wait for LN. Do not sell.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:40:14
Not disagree with you. Saying large transactions are not good on LN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:28:32
Meh. Just hodl. Fees are half of that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:45:29
No. Not until lighting. Otherwise you are just spamming the block chain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:32:19
They are working in 3rd layer solutions. They are very smart and ahead of the game. Have faith.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:59:43
Yes that fee needs to triple or quad.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:55:04
Because unless the highway is on fire people will be fine with adding lanes. So gotta hurt it to help it grow. Something like that, don't try to use it to buy a coffee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:01:00
You mean late comers will be at the pipe. Lol, LN will work for all early adopters it will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:30:38
Eh if it's been 14 hours fee is probably too low. Might take a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:15:08
Yes it should be noted that it is recommended to run a full node to monitor for counterparties trying to steal your LN transactions. If you don't publish your dispute in the time locked period on the block chain you will lose funds. This incurs a tx cost.
Also. If you do not run a full node you will need to pay a third party service to watch your LN wallet for people trying to steal.
All should theoretically be cheaper than paying a real BTC TX fee because it should be higher by the time the network is up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:00:48
Yeah, and get back all the merchants that quit bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:44:40
You should not be tx that low an amount. If you do you are spamming thr network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:46:59
Looks like about 30mb with in that range. So about 300 minutes on average up to 300 extra minutes for variance.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:34:08
Merchants know not to accept 0conf bitcoin now. However you will want to only use BTC for things you don't need to wait hours for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:45:13
What was your fee level?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:15:59
Agree. Anyone holding less than 1k should not use bitcoin and go away to lower TXs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:23:11
Well, the network is intended to not have expensive transactions done on it, the security model breaks down in large transactions and also routing.
It will make BTC great for small coffee transactions but nothing larger than maybe 1k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:13:24
No. Fees are bidding up at the moment. Your fee is probably too low and will be dropped in a few days or up to 2 weeks. 
You can look at the various fee estimators to guess a best fee. If you guess wrong your transaction will be dropped or delayed by a few days. 
You can pay a third party miner more money to accelerate your transaction... But not in bitcoin.
Welcome to the future of money!
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:40:01
Sound logic. You should add that to the FAQ.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:10:29
Not necessarily, we could develop a 3rd layer for that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:04:33
Yes but no larger blocks until LN launches in 18months. High tx fees support the BTC network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:29:08
Contribute code review. Tell whiners about LN will solve current TX and fee issues.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:14:08
You are causing a false emergency to force the issue. We've resist this for 5 years. Go join a different coin if you don't believe in the btc road map...
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:34:42
This is spamming the network. Why would you do this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:33:04
I believe you might be looking for something else. Of you don't believe in LN, you don't believe in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:06:32
Don't worry about it. It should be fine when it's up and running. No need to ask these hypothetical questions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:19:40
No. Perfectly fine.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:02:14
Wallet change addresses problematic.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:51:51
People need to chill out and not tx unless it's important. Otherwise pay the highest fee. It's around $50. If you don't think this is fair don't tx. Otherwise it's spam.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:28:02
The funding transaction needs to happen on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:29:00
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:16:41
Naw it's fine. Use gdax for free btc TX. Coinbase is non segwit traitors. They are causing congestion.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:54:57
Additionally, LN users should be online to watch for fraud from their channel partners. You will need to publish a fraud proof or you will lose your funds.
You can trust a third-party to do this for you for a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:28:28
Yes. Everything is fine. People just need to stop spamming low fee TXs for awhile and it will sort itself out when LN is delivered.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:49:28
This is good. If you don't think LN will work you should not use BTC. High tx fees are good and encourage LN adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:20:33
Core position is the don't need as many miner's I'm the future. Miner's are a parasite when no block rewards. They can fuck off at that point. We don't need them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:33:06
I believe low fee TXs are spam. Doesn't matter if one person or many. If they don't pay the highest fee to guarantee 1mb block they are spamming. They should just hodl and work out some alternatives way ton keep track of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:31:51
Not allowed to talk about alts here. Should delete this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:43:37
No no no. 1mb blocks is bitcoin. We don't want to be that other coin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:44:49
Hodl. Don't tx right now because of congestion unless high tx fee. Lots of people don't know how to look at fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:16:52
Wait for LN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:34:48
No. Fee should be never come down only up. What a perfect time for LN. They will launch it soon. They have been working on it for 5 years not a lot left to do.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:41:21
You should not TX with a low fee. It will never confirm in 2 weeks. Btc is not for you right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:09:26
No. People are spamming the network with shitty fee TXs. They need to stop.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:18:57
Yes. We wait for LN. Doesn't matter what happens on BTC, as per core dev team. You can find several references to what should be done, like off chain tabs or boycott non segwit companies.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:42:40
Yes, I believe a lower blocksize will force LN adoption and help develop 3rd layer solutions. Also keeps cpu /storage in check for future growth. Allows regular people to run nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:04:04
You need to edit your response to locked funds. No one can relay more than the amount they have locked. Need to buy a car? Better hope you can route to someone that has locked more than your price of the car...
Hence the concern that the most liquid well connected hubs will naturally centralize around banks....
But you are 100 percent correct that BTC should stay at 1MB blocks or reduce block size to put pressure on LN. It needs to arrive faster. They promised it in what 2013?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:46:30
Lol. We're buying the future. Who cares if BTC is unusable now. That why everyone is so mad the core dev seem not to care about fees currently. Because they don't care about right now and users. They care about future and future users on LN. More important. Legacy btc is broken and LN will fix it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:10:39
You and retailer need to stake coins to fund a channel. This is unavoidable. Your empty wallet can not receive since it does not have funds in a channel.
Think of hubs like banks. You need a checking account to with them with money to withdraw or send. They don't like this comparison but it's true.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:34:37
Fee estimation is naturally impossible to get correct. If it was, everyone else would out fee the previously guessed fee making the whole thing moot. Unless they want to submit to a fee arbitrator which defeats the whole purpose of decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:35:56
Have faith that they know what they are doing. It might be hard to see when there is such a large backlog and people not understanding why the future of money is unusable to the not wealthy, but LN will solve these problems in maybe 6 to 18 months.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:29:03
That's what you don't get. If you can't afford the toll lane don't get on. Just wait until LN is arrives.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:29:49
6 to 18 months. Schedule is useless as it has slipped in the past.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:11:53
Bitcoin price near ATH. Markets are smart. They see value in LN. Why are you here if you don't believe.
Also fees are closer to $45. This is good. Prevents spam TXs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:13:43
Less miners. Not no miners.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:08:12
No. We should never raise the BTC block size. I believe there are too many speculators. I agree with theym0s to lower the block size if we are to hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:14
Bitcoin as current is by design not for the masses. The masses need to wait for LN. Anyone who want pay the $33 transaction fee should not hodl BTC. What do you think LN is for?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:07:52
Yes finally people get what he was saying. He basically said that if you don't have an existing relationship with the shop where you can open a tab then BTC is not for this use case right now without LN. Which should be coming soon. He wouldn't avoid answering unless it was coming soon.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:04:19
You'll have to download a client and craft a transaction manually. Consider your fee level before you send, otherwise you are spamming through network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:42:39
Because we've had this discussion for the past 5 years. It is not happening and nor should it. 1mb is plenty once LN launches.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:23:13
Don't worry long term core plan with LN makes miner's in the future worthless. They won't need that many to secure the network.
That's why alter coin wants to scale on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:13:06
14 days unless a node rebroadcast.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:04:14
Yes. Wait for LN to do your beer purchases. That's just low fee tx spam man.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:14:28
I'm back here to encourage people to stick to the 1mb block size, telling folks to price their TXs appropriately or otherwise they are spamming the network. Too many wah wah my TXs stuck posts!
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:43:51
Yep 3rd layer is going to kick ass.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:29:59
This is the only one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:57:10
You mean like how the network is setup right now? Price data comes from exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:43:04
No, it's not. The engineered fee situation is genius as they timed it just right to force voluntary LN adoption. No one will want to transact without LN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:38:47
For you yes. LN will solve this. You can take $100 and have a $50 instant money send with low fees. Obviously you want to lock more money than but you get the idea.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:25:25
No let it collapse. It might crash the btc price but who cares. We'll gain  it back because LN will take all crypto TXs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:11:55
This is good. To the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:40:02
Do not tx, tell your friends not to tx.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:43:21
Yes but banks conviently have regulatory requirements that demand they leave large amounts of money sitting around. Why not put them in a large hub and charge merchants access to hubs for fiat since the can route the largest peers for the lowest fees since they are the only ones large enough to afford to.
Basically the same as internet peering and backbones. Those don't run out of houses since data centers have cost scaling efficiency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:25:34
Because this line of discussion has fractured the network in the past. Therefore it should not be discussed. You are risking a ban.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:03:40
Other 150,000 pathetic low fee of $10-35. We don't want those spam TXs. They are just contributing to the fee climb.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:36:33
Yeah your first mistake.. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:04:58
They did a poor job. Lots of people mad that fake bitcoin was unbuyable. Real bitcoin unaffected.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:17:51
The current fee is impossible to guess as everyone else is doing their best guess. You should just not tx and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:17:42
But the $30-50 fees are genius. Everyone will have to use segwit and LN when it launches.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:31:26
Yes and if the backlog stays LN adoption will be huge since the regular network is bogged. ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪
