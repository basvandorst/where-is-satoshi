Step 1. Use Gemini
Step 2. Transaction amounts less than $10,000
Step 3. Multiple Bank accounts

Why Lambos? Nah Im serious. Why not Ferrari? Aston Martin? Seriously why did Lambos have to be the car of choice for Cryptos? If I ever get rich on crypto, I’m buying an Aston Martin and making Rock Ballad (thats right, Ballad not Rap) video about BTC.

Not even available to trade? Thats odd. If it was a bank transfer it should be immediately available to trade. You wont be able to withdraw until your bank finalizes the transaction though.
Edit: just saw it was a wire not bank transfer. Wires can take a long time just depending on how quickly your bank finalizes and releases the transaction

If it was purchased using a bank account number, credit card number, or bank transfer the charges can be reversed by the bank in a fraud case. 
You, the vendor, would be out the amount paid or transferred, as well as your product (the Bitcoin you released to them in exchange for their payment).

Hodling is difficult when there is not a united consensus of how to proceed. Then dips happen. It makes it hard to stay committed at times.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:08:30
Not talking about success in terms of price. I mean in order to solidify justified widespread reliance and faith in what it stands for. Right now bitcoin is like a house that was given to an entire family in a will, and no one can decide if they should rent, sell, keep it, short-sell, or auction it. Everyone has a different opinion of what to do to move on from here, and that creates instability.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:43:24
The only correction was something we always knew was there, which was the exchanges stopped factoring in Koreas premium price on BTC because it was ridiculous to do so.  Everything else is relevant to BTCs history of an exaggerated instability in price, which is always going to be prevalent because its truly investor and user controlled, as opposed to 100 people sitting on a board adjusting price because they have a “hunch” on what they feel the true value is.
Once BTC users are able to agree on Blocksize/LN debate and stop trading based on mini-cryptos potential for quick gains, and a MAJOR organization like Microsoft, Apple, Google, or Amazon invests in actually accepting it  as a standard form of payment, we will find it is most likely undervalued at this point.

Yah more selling on weekends because day-traders work M-F and more buying happens.

@_date: 2018-01-18 15:13:17
I did drop some BTC into some other coins that dropped and had a bigger overall rebound, and moved back in under 11k. So im about even, but i didnt cash out.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:46:24
Its not a correction. Its an artificial deflation of prices for regulators to gain some level of control over the wealth it creates. A correction would be a genuine devaluation by the end user through realization. Corrections are yet to come and the FUD tactics being used by China and Korea are going to do the exact opposite of what they intended in the long run.

Idk how Banks work in Canada. But typically with stolen cards or accounts the Bank, and the vendor are the ones who lose. Often the vendors only option is to write off the loss and pursue charges against the thief. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:15:38
I don’t get these questions. There are plenty of calculators out there. I have two used S7-LN  miners I purchased from ebay for about $1400 and run on Slushpool. Together they total 7.4 Th. Current block difficulties, they pull about .0015 BTC per day, and it pays out at .01 BTC to a wallet. Electricity is .07 per kilowatt here. So together they cost about $80 a month to run. 
So thats a payout about every 6-7 days of .01 BTC, which is about $160. 
($160 x 4 weeks) - $80 = $560
$560 x 3 months = $1680
$1680 - $1400 = $280 profit after 3 months running
This isn’t even factoring potential increase in value.
Right now BTC would have to drop below $2000 per share  to NOT be profitable. And theres a huge caveat to that because the odds are  that many fly-by-night miners would turn machines off long before it hit that point, increasing the over all reward per Th and frequency of payout.

Coinbase is all in on the crapcoin push. Ever since their push on Litecoin and now BCash. Crapcoin has the most room for growth among the most possibilites for growth. The sooner everyone will realize that Coinbase is NOT our friend, but our enemy the better.
Don’t you think its funny how BItcoin has an amazing surge yesterday, and now Coinbase comes out and says this now. Its an attempt at damage control to serve their own interest.
They have done EVERYTHING in their power to force the overthrow of Bitcoin. Believe the user and the miners, they are who control it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:10:20
I think there was plenty of evidence with their launch of BTC that Ver, Coinbase, and NBC were in-cahoots to manipulate BCash by attacking BTC through their “bubble” statements. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:51:40
No, I am actually still investing. I have a ton of faith in BTC. I did miss out previously. Not gonna lie. But I certainly don’t hope it crashes. There are too many good reasons for why it should succeed. That and I don’t want anyone to lose anything. If anything, I wish everyone would have just made a killing a year ago to begin with. I suppose my topic phrasing, maybe, came off as heated. But I certainly didn’t mean to demean BTC. Im just saying, these drama cases cause people to lose faith when there is still so much potential. And Hodling van be difficult at times.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:59:21
This is called stone walling lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:15:09
Yet Coinbase, Ver, and NBC present the bubble as fact not speculation on BCash/Coinbase Launch Day. Oh and BTC dropped significantly the day Day Bcash launched on Coinbase , while BCash went to almost $4000 a share before shutting down trades because they were busted for insider trading.

He intentionally attempted to accelerate BTC D-Day by using insider information to inflate the value of BTH and derail BTC. By inflating the value of BTH through multiple large buys, it created an influx in investors selling BTC to invest in BTH under false pretenses. He colluded with Coinbase to manipulate the market and should be in jail. Instead, he gets to flaunt his scam on the network that supported him and financially supported this scam.
The price is actually STILL being misrepresented according to buy orders. And I still maintain the entire “freeze” this morning had nothing to do with finding insider trading, but rather that they were busted for it and had to buy time to figure out how they were going to keep BTH from crashing out with 6k sell orders and only a few hundred purchase orders. So the CEO of Coinbase,and this Noz, could spend 8 hours trying to pitch the death of BTC to pop-up investors.

As long as you arent paying absurd amounts for electric as long as the price stays over like 3k you are fine

I’m a hobbyist. Not trying to get rich, just a sound investment hobby. I look at how long its been around, and performance since inception. Sort of how one might look at growth mutuals.

You have to do your research and decide if its the best thing for you, and if you believe in it. If you family is never going to talk to you ever again over money there are other problems that need to be addressed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:06:15
Lol. Ok. So. Normally I would have said Bcash or something of the sort. But some of the exchanges are listing it as BTH, so as I am watching and waiting for the crash on Bitcoin cash, I am going off of those tickers because I am lazy.

Gemini is dedicated to servicing cryptos that contribute to the market positively. Not the pump/dumps purely intended to disrupt the flow of the market.

The US government is attempting to subpoena accounts with more than $20,000 in transactions from Coinbase. My best advice would be to take out in smaller sums as long as it makes sense financially.  That... and stop using Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:42:14
It is already motion as of November 27th for accounts with more than 20,000 in transactions in a calendar year for 2013-2015. Get it moved to Gemini and withdraw in small amounts.

If I’ve learned one thing since having 6 BTC in November of last year, running an Antminer S7-ln since January of 2017, investing $200 a month since December 2016, selling all of it after the first drop back to $900 a share, and stop investing in June 2017... its don’t sell until you have enough to stop working for the rest of your life... and even then probably don’t sell.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:16:55

Im sorry, but its impossible to believe any negative press against BTC at the moment. BTC has literally done the opposite of everything most “experts” in finance have predicted it to do. How can hey claim a bubble when they obviously have no idea how to even categorize it financially?
And after the attempted screw job by executives and coinbase yesterday, its very obvious that the end consumer, investor, and user or BTC is still very faithful to the idea. If not, BTC would have plummeted and been completely replaced overnight by BC Cash. 
BTC has a very likable pattern of performance just with larger ups and downs, especially when compared to most successful stocks. The only reason we keep getting these articles are to try to convince pop-up buyers to sell off in an attempt to  hurt value because the “experts” cant fathom how a commodity, completely controlled, regulated, and administered by end-users and workers can work in a world where financial success is dictated by a 3rd party system.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:58:41
In which case you WOULD need to read articles and check prices to know when to transfer it. Rinse and repeat lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:53:40
I would look into what the cost of CC transactions would be, as well as taxes for cash, and offer a nice juicy discount to encourage people to pay with crypto since those fees arent occurring with crypto
