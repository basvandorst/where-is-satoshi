Not at all, are you blind? People upvote completley irrelevant crazy conspiracy theories, doom-posts and general nonsense all the time.
I am a skeptic by heart, I am not a blind-believer in Bitcoin. I have been concerned about market manipulation, the potential of 51% attacks and so on since I joined this community. Most Bitcoiners are very open to discussing all aspects of crypto and working together to better the technology and applications that utilize it.
It is again the greedy and weak speculators that downvote anything that doesn't fit their narrative, meaning they will downvote anything that resembles negativity in the up days and upvote anything negative in the panic days. Humans find solace wherever they can, so when the market is tanking most speculators first go into denial and then they ironically join the blame-train afterwards. Very fascinating part of psychology.

On the contrary. Venture Capitalists firms are investing into the Bitcoin functionality, not the idealism. It's not like these billionaires really care all that much about the utopian-features of the blockchain, they see the functionality and realize how it enables completely new services that would not even be dreamt up just a few years ago.
Yes, you are right that there are a lot of short-term profit seekers, which starts panicking like little bitches when the numbers are in the red, which again sadly cause a lot of true Bitcoin-enthusiasts to get this perception that something has changed, which it has not. Which is why I wrote my post

Oh sorry, I got a life so when one of my posts reaches the frontpage I don't have time to reply to every post the same day. So sorry, I apologize, pardon, suck my cock

I literally want to see people making such irrelevant comments as yours get maimed by a train

Personally I don't think Willy played that big of a part at all, but let's just accept it for the sake of argument. That would still only mean that Willy caused Bitcoin to be recognized by the whole world.
The functionality that lead Bitcoin from 0 to mid 100s (that's quite a fucking amazing feat) was simply exposed to 100x as many people once the price surged. This was pre-VC capital infusions etc. So then the real price would still be way higher than the mid 100s today.

Bitstamp hack happened post-panic. Butterfly Labs scam was minor in the big picture.
VoS shutting down is neutral news, not negative. They CHOSE to close down a profitable business in order to focus on other efforts with higher profit margins. There are so many exchanges at this point that this is not even worthy of mention after it's initial announcement

"real account", this is reddit. Most normal people with normal lives have like 5 different ones. I forget my password, takes less time to create a new account than recover password. This is reddit.. I am sorry to hear this is your real life

This is partially true, but not fully. Ideally this is how it would work, but see humans have this built-in mechanism called loss aversion. So if a regular person invests 1 dollars and it goes to 10 dollars and he starts internalizing the fact that he now has 10 dollars, he will shit his pants as soon as it goes down to 9 or 8 dollars.
We see this with Bitcoin too, Bitcoin has had a rise of NASA in the '60s proportions, but because it's down ~75% from it's inflated high, people now panic.

There is nothing wrong with investing resources into other blockchains, this is good for crypto in general. With sidechains/similar solutions Bitcoin can then adopt and adapt to this innovative technology.

ugh so many pathetic trolls,yes if I wanted to cash out the best strategy would definitely be to go on and not to an exchange. genius IQ you got there

You're retarded, just because someone makes a random account 21 days ago does not mean that's when they started using reddit .Goddamn I've used reddit since 2009
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:20:46
I have no problems with it,  but I recognize that this is something most people do infact grapple with, which explains the panic

User and investor, as you should be if you ever are going to invest into something

check the blockchain, yes it is.
as for solar, completley different, solar is growing all over the world, US just can't compete with Chinese manufacturing, doesn't mean solar is bad, same with bitcoin
