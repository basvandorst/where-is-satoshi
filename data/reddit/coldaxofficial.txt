Well that’s somewhat true lol... I’m always worried of this since I take my Ledger everywhere 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:35:13
Well that’s awesome. They also thought about this! Nice. Should be hard to do so not everyone with low amounts in it knows about it 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:39
Yeah same. Have a few bitcoin on a laptop or pc but my mom threw my passphrase away and the bed into which I sewed a copy. Not mad tho
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:04
Dude I’m in the same situation. The bigger bitcoin gets the more depressed I am. I started trading now and I made 5k in two weeks just listening to news and buying the rumors etc. (Although I’m a bit down again on alts right now). I just realized that I can still become a millionaire while young if I keep going like this. Don’t really have time since I’m working 16 hours a day but I hope to make enough to quit my jobs by February or March. 
But at the same time now I have to work for it and I don’t get any sleep while I could be rich from just an investment without ever working myself almost to death. Still feels bad 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:03:58
Well I can’t blame you. If you have a lot in it you don’t want to even risk a small chance 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:28:38
Multiple millions for me also. I just put all my faith into mnx. Maybe it will really constantly grow over many years and it’s kinda my backup plan. If I don’t get rich with anything else there’s a small chance that MNX will be worth a lot one day

I just purchased it :) if you need any help with the store let me know. I run my own Shopify store 
Edit: the confirmation didn’t arrive and the page expired after 7 instead of 15 minutes. Can you check? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:21:10
I check my phone every few minutes. I only check my wallet when I need it
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:11:46
Oh man you should really not have Facebook or google login when selling monero shirts... also it hurts conversions in general man. But yeah I don’t care 16$ is pretty good :) still gonna buy
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:04:17
Cool thx. I believe it’s 2048 x 1536 .... yep google confirms this! 
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:33:39
“No no it’s fraud! We need someone to stop them”
Next day: “What?! The government wants to regulate and destroy crypto?!”
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:55:20
Or, even better, gold...
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:46:16
Nice. Will get the Monero shirt! Mobile page is lagging on iPad fyi 
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:26:50
Well, if you’re really the founder that’s awesome! 
Also, if bitcoin goes up a bit I will participate :P always was a dream of mine
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:31:29
Wow this is amazing. I wasn’t aware of it. Nice!
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:56:15
Who is he
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:31:39
Holy shit. There must be some good info on there 
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:36:16
Yep. An old lady got hacked or something here and the next morning her 600k € are gone. All her live savings. The bank gave her a check of a few hundred euros...
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:40:55
Dude same. I had no form to fill out but they didn’t let me get my money for 10 minutes straight. It was more or less a larger sum. And they knew I was gonna invest it in crypto because I had daily transactions to coinbase but I just told them I need a new car at the end. Not your fucking business... I don’t keep much money in there anymore 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:06:59
Awesome :) thanks �� 
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:24:22
Cool, thx! I imagine the picture doesn’t exist anymore?
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:26:05
Hold up. How about we just keep our bitcoin in the first place :O
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:58:31
Or the pizza man was just like “pfft.. nerd. I hope this shuts him up finally” and forgot about it and the passphrase 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:25:40
Yeah it worked. It’s still odd that bitcoin needs so long
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:02:37
Mine too. In this exact minute. It says unconfirmed transaction. What can I do in this case? Never had to deal with this 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:10:33
Shouldn’t it show up on blockchain.info regardless? It shows status: completed on GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:37:54
I feel you. Spent like 5 bitcoin on some stupid home made sauces back in 2013/14 „to help circulate bitcoin“. God damn it 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:40:20
Thank you! I thought I lost it. Only thing I’m losing now is the SALT dip :/
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:34:22
YES! (I don't even know how or if realistic but sounds awesome)
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:09:34
Ha! I bought some Dogecoin as a joke right at the beginning. I don't know how many anymore and I can't find old Laptop. My grandma had it and lost it somewhere apparently. I just hope it wasn't too much 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:25:31
How many BTC for that?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:25:31
How many BTC for that?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:48:21
Thx man. Looks dope. But why pay with fiat only :( 
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:33:34
THIS! ^ I wish my dad would have understood that a few years ago when I told him. He would have been rich with 4 packs a day. And if it wouldn't have worked out he would at least be healthy! It's a win - win situation. We could actually get people to invest that way. More people are going to invest 5-10$ a day than, say, 1000$ at once
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:46:55
How about both? Put your winnings straight into heroin
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:55:04
Probably. Our hope keeps telling us it's not too late for enormous profits so it has to take over! Realistically you will make a good amount of money on it but never get back to the old days 
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:05:32
I created a software in school that does just this! Don't choose to pay taxes on roads? Well if you get caught driving on one you get a fine. And so on. Unfortunately it doesn't work like this with everything but a system with some choices would be nice 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:22:04
Making sure he stays the richer one. Smart boss 
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:21:17
Is this legit? Did he say 2018?
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:28:12
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:48:21
Thx man. Looks dope. But why pay with fiat only :( 
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:30:13
Me too :'( paid it out to pay debt and promised to buy those million again ASAP. Forgot it...
