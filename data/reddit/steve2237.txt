Stop defending sexual assault.

I'm not conflating anything. I was replying to comment that mentioned Trump "grabbing" which is assault. You switched to "looking" in an attempt to conflate.
Then you moved on to Epstein, unprompted, and are making insane statements about 14 year old prostitutes being able to provide consent. Really gives an interesting window to your mind.

"Finally, the results of our experimental study also demonstrated to a great extent that Yelp filtering is reliable" 
That paper is about trying to reverse engineer the methodology Yelp is using.  The Yelp filter removes reviews which have a high probability of being fake.  Isn't that what it is supposed to do?  Nobody would use the site if it was full of shill reviews.

What is he even talking about?  I listened as long as I could, and it sounded like he was going for a punchline about "this secret currency is actually USD LOLOLOLOL!!!!"

Have you ever advertised with Yelp?  The FIRST PAGE of the contract requires business owners to sign that they understand they are paying for advertising, which is completely separate from and has no effect on their reviews.

I learned to type on a computer in the 90's in the USA and always double space after periods, wrong or not.

Simply not true.  Yelp advertising sales are completely independent of Yelp business reviews.
Here is independent research backing that up.    “Yelp's current implementation of the filtering algorithm does not treat advertisers' reviews in a manner different to non-advertisers' reviews.”

I just bought a pair of shoes I didn't really need... but I wanted to support overstock!  I hope this works out well for them and other retailers take notice!

Escrow is not back.  Or at least that's what a friend told me.....

Until a definitive ruling saying otherwise, I think the best treatment is to consider them a capital asset and pay taxes on gains when realized (sold).  But hey, I'm not a lawyer (but I am a CPA!)

What line of the 1040 does that get entered on?

True, but it is disingenuous to say that he collected $80M in commission, because we have no idea how many he is still holding. That $80m is about 600k btc, right? What if he sold half the bitcoins when they were were worth $10?  He would have netted $3M from that, and now only has half his coins, leading to a max of $43M.
Also, one key thing I feel most reporting is leaving out is that the 600k btc collected in commission is his gross profit, not his net profit.  He had to pay to host the site, and he paid people to work for him, so 600k btc was not his net income.

It's not really false when those are the two major smartphone ecosystems at the moment, and both of those are true, current events from each respective system.

Interesting. So maybe my $1000 deposit triggered a review of my account, and they looked at the memo lines for my p2p transfers and saw they were related to localbitcoins. Thanks for the info, but either way that leaves a bad taste in my mouth about dwolla. I'll probably end up buying with cash in person through localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:33:57
When I bought on localbitcoins, it was a direct payment to another dwolla user. I'd bought maybe $700 in amounts of $100 to $300 over the past few months, with the most recent transaction being over a month ago. The $1 to camp bx was just over 30 days ago.  The transfer I initiated today was $1000, which would have been my largest yet. I assume the size of the transfer flagged it for some sort of review.

I'm having a similar problem.  I deposited funds to bitinstant on wednesday (1/30).  Did not see the funds in instawallet that night.  Instawallet was down 1/31.  As of earlier today (2/1), the funds are still not in my wallet.  Bitinstant support said that my order was processed correctly, but Instawallet hasn't gotten back to me yet.
