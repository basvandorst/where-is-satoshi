Great post. I'm 18 years old, invested a little bit in bitcoin, but mainly for fun and for the sake that I want to be a part of it (I actually use bitcoin for transfering money). At the moment I'm going to school, but after lessons I'm selling virtual goods and I'm getting very good money and it brings me happiness because I love doing it. I could have invested more in bitcoin, but if someone asked me to choose between selling virtual goods (trying to do business) and investing in bitcoin. By all means I would pick selling virtual items, because it gives me a drive, motivation to live to think and to expand.

Okey, I will look into it.

What about now? Kraken still has a fixed 0.001btc fee, would kraken up my fee to 700satoshis/byte or no? I don't understand how kraken fees work and how bitcoin fees work...
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:00:58
I like kraken, but the last time I tried to do the transaction I did it for 55 minutes because the website crashed so many times... But you see, I USE bitcoin I need a place where I can buy btc via fiat and send btc to other people.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:49:27
The problem is that i use kraken and it has set 0.001 btc fee, i can not change that :/

Thanks, doing my best. Need to make the best of my future :P But doing business has a bad influence on my academic achievements ;D

It's very sad that I can't use bitcoin of what it was created for... It's insane... Can't use kraken too, because they can't fix their website...
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:16:52
I use it as a currency, I'm the one who is not investing it in "GOLD" and hodling. What I do is this: in foreign countries there are people who only accept bitcoin, they don't accept fiat. So I have to send bitcoin. If I could send fiat then I would do that. Is this considered exploiting?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:10:40
What do you mean I exploit?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:17:53
I'm holding for 20 years, but I want to have the btc if kraken runs :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:59:00
Yes, but to have that insane amount of confidence in myself is pretty hard. I still will try to be okey (average) in school, then I will go to university and there I will try to be a really good professional in my job and at the same time I might do something great which would generate me enought money not to worry about living.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:13:11
Could you explain more about exploiting? I mean, I used bitcoin for what it was created, for using it. I use it for "business", but it's not a business, money isn't that big.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:59:56
But I often need to buy bitcoin by fiat and then send bitcoin to the user. Can I do that in offline wallet? I guess no?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:25:27
Oh my fucking god. I thought that 0.001btc  fee is 100sat/byte, but in reality it's (419 sat/B) :DDD It's very nice.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:01:41
What about buying bitcoin, because I transfer fiat to kraken and buy btc, then I transfer btc to another person.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:56:47
18 here, but what to do if i don't have extrq money? I mean 1k isn't enough.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:07:12
I wonder what OP is doing in real life. Give me da secret...
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:21:51
Holy shit, you have the balls. Today I bought 0.17btc and almost fainted...
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:06:30
Why unconfirmed transactions are still growing. It's 114K atm.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:20:03
How many bitcoin's managed to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:35:37
I would send 0.16295btc
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:26:07
Yestrday I was thinking about investing all my savings into BTC, but I didn't and I'm proud of myself. What I am going to do is to invest only 10% of my net worth into btc and maybe in ETH (I am young, student, so don't have a lot of money). 
And also, i think getting rich fast is very bad thing... Personally, i would love to be a multi-millionaire, but i want to get them by my hard work and providing some value for people. There's hundreds of cases when people get rich, their lifestyles also decrease. I don't want it to happen to me.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:14:49
I am is school st the moment. I am trying to earn money on the side, but that is tough atm.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:06:10
That's the problem because in kraken the fee is automatic - 0.0001 btc.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:17:17
1 million?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:43:53
But it would be very nice to have 10 000 BTC :P
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:02:45
That would be epic.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:28:39
I also want to withdraw all my euros from kraken, but afraid that they will hold my money... 
How much they took from you? And what country you are from?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:37:19
But maybe withdrawal for me wouldn't be an issue? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:14:03
You mean you buy 250 BTC?????
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:32:49
which wallet do you use?
