Gotcha thank you for that 
@_date: 2016-04-20 16:54:09
Is there a page where we can find locations it's currently offered?
@_date: 2016-04-21 04:07:58
Gotcha okay that makes sense thanks 
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:18:37
The chip helps reduce a merchant's liability right?
@_date: 2016-04-05 12:51:46
So let's say someone sells drugs and accepts btc as payment. That transaction is illegal and btc is used as part of an illegal transaction, but if that vendor then uses that btc for a number of legal purchases, would that not cancel it out? Or does illegally obtained currency make any legal transactions thereafter illegal as well?

Yeah currently you can't use TOR but if the coding got changed so that TOR would work then you'd be pretty anonymous right?
@_date: 2016-04-05 12:54:11
I would argue that the bigger problem is banks. Not fiat cash in and of itself. Cash is almost entirely anonymous (though you could track serial numbers by hand if you really wanted to) and nobody can freeze your cash. Banks can just stop you from using your money (well their money since you're loaning it to them) and you're SOL 
@_date: 2016-04-06 12:49:00
Oh ok that makes sense. Because they'd assume the merchant had something to do with cloning it
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:14:10
The only kind of blue balls I'd be ecstatic to have
@_date: 2016-04-06 01:11:35
Can you download it with TOR while running TAILS and have it saved there? If so, that should make it fairly anonymous no?
@_date: 2016-04-06 01:13:10
And fiat isn't really the problem anyway. It's the banking system. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 14:44:26
Brb banning the USD because people buy drugs with it 
@_date: 2016-04-06 12:49:37
Okay gotcha. Just curious
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:07:16
I started with a $250 limit, made a purchase, and now my limit is $25 and Coinbase wants all sorts of information about what I do for work, where I get other bitcoin from that's not bought through coinbase. About to be done with Coinbase. I'm moving maybe $1000 in and out each month and somehow that equates to needing a review. Like damn it's just day trading, and having people pay me in bitcoin vs checks. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 20:51:19
So is this interest rate a yearly one but compounded weekly? Or that interest rate weekly?
@_date: 2016-04-27 22:58:07
It's just simpler for low volume stuff but obviously it's no longer an option. Kraken/cex.io then?
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:45:09
Same same 
@_date: 2016-04-02 04:21:30
Well if it grows 350% that puts it a little under $1500
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:36:23
You said it's rolled out 25%, so is the debit card purchase feature available everywhere in the US already?
@_date: 2016-03-31 13:54:36
So it's causing problems if you send btc directly from Coinbase to LBTC? What if you used Helix as an intermediary?
@_date: 2016-03-28 23:34:11
Correct me if I'm wrong, but prices are higher because of inflation. Lowering prices won't cause deflation. Removing a a bunch of money from circulation would cause deflation, but I think we're past the point that that would help because so much is just numbers in a computer now. It's why bitcoin should in the long run grow in value. It has a limited amount. And as more people want a limited product, it's value increases. But the US has done on a smaller scale what Zimbabwe did. They just printed more money which made it worth less. You have to make the dollar worth more if you want to reverse inflation. So you need to limit its supply, which doesn't work well in practice because the money supply is controlled by the Fed. With bitcoin being (in design at least) decentralized, no one can control its supply the way the Fed controls our money supply. A loaf of bread didn't get more expensive to produce. The dollar just became weaker so the price went up. The problem is that wages don't increase at the same rate as inflation. If they did, it wouldn't matter. $1 for bread when you get paid $10/hr would be the same if bread rose to $2 as long as your wage doubled along with it. 
21 million bitcoin could be used as global currency. It would just rise in value incredibly and it would be normal to utilize satoshi as the main denomination

I mean it'll look sketchy yes, but just cause I have a billion btc or a billion dollars in cash doesn't mean I earned it illicitly and it's still up to LE to prove that I did. But with btc being a cryptocurrency and not something like a USD note, I would imagine it would be easier to come up with a BS reason why you had so much 
@_date: 2016-06-05 04:39:37
Yep had my account closed because of something similar to this. Made a purchase overseas (legal, importation of non controlled Rx meds) and they shut me down saying I violated terms and conditions. I feel like we should warn people of this. Better to use exchanges solely for that, and btc to another wallet like electrum or the like, then make purchases from there 
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:26:10
If we're being honest here, it was a much more secure way to go about purchasing AAS. That how I first heard of it. Now it's a combination of things. Holding some, using some as an accepted currency for AAS and related medications, minor trading to make a few bucks when needed. It's an interesting concept. It can viably serve as both currency and stock 
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:37:32
So how rich are you now?
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:40:03
I agree. I try to push it as much as I can. One of my favorite things is the "push" aspect vs a pull one. It's essentially like using cash. Unless you steal my wallet, you can't get my money in any way besides me giving it to you. It's safer than CC and nearly instant 
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:17:46
¿Por qué no los dos?
@_date: 2016-06-27 03:00:36
It doesn't like my jailbroken phone. Only complaint for the iOS version. Can't make that dumb notification go away 
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:00:47
Definitely will! Sounds great!
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:43:41
Basically, "Thank you for your call. A banking agent will be with you in a few moments to tell you more lies"

Millibitcoin. 0.001 btc
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:22:01
I'd like an answer to this as well. I'm heading to buy a motorcycle next weekend and I'm paying in cash. God forbid something happens and a cop steals my cash 
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:22:40
I use this all the time. Really enjoy it. If other shipping options were able to be integrated, such as overnight shipping, that would be fantastic 
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:00:43
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:09:25
Can anyone else confirm or deny  
I saw it brought up on an earlier thread. It sounds great and simple for converting btc back to fiat but the prices have me a little concerned. After their fee, you're still making about 4% above market value. Too good to be true?
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:14:21
I'll try to find the thread but it was a few days ago so I'll have to search. It def sounds too good to be true though
