I know some PhDs in mathmatics/etc who are founders of bitcoin startups who would LOVE to help your college with the course in any way they can.

I try to never play the telephone game, especially with things like finance where one similar word can completely change the entire articles meaning

I'm sorry to be 'that' guy but would you happen to have an English version of the article. 
edit: i appreciate the insight on google translate but its more so that I can email it around to colleagues.

There is ONE security precuation that will slove ALL of this, every time I log into chase from a different IP address it sends me a text message/email with a password that I must enter to login, I find it outstanding that they are't doing that because it would have prevented this mess

While I agree with you atm Bitcoins are a speculative investment not a currency.,

Just wait, One day soon the pirate bay of bitcoin exchanges will come about and revolutionize the way we think about money, this is not that day and MtGox is not that exchange.

In NYC, willing to do secretarial/temp work for bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:18:37
The fact of the matter is that currently the vast majority of the value derived from bitcoins is from its potential SHOULD it become adopted, it had very little true present value because it isn't accepted anywhere, until that changes, current bitcoins prices will reflect anticipated potential rather than true present worth.

The fundamental error that near everyone keeps making is that bitcoins are A currency not THE currency, in a free market there is no such thing as THE solution to a problem just A solution with its own pros and cons. Bitcoins pro's are that it is deflationary and near impossible for a coercive entity to regulate. It is a solution that solves some unmet demand, It is not nor will ever be the end all be all, the monopolistic view of every solution needing to be THE solution is an inherently coercive authoritarian concept that doesn't apply to bit coins

THE fastest non-bullshit way to exchange bitcoins is to come out to one of my BitcoinNYC meetings (we meet three times a week now). Our Monday meeting is Called Satoshi Square, its where we have an open market on bitcoins in Union Square, check it out we even had NYTimes cover it.

As a non-program who is looking to partner with a programmer to start a bitcoin based business, what should I be looking for in a partner.
Or crazy better yet, do you know anyone in NYC programmers looking to start something in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:21:59
Bitcoin Startups is a good meetup, but they meet only once a month, you should consider coming out to 
we meet weekly/ sometimes more, and all the bitcoin junkies are to be found there. =P

It's run by Jeffery Tucker, should be fun, there is this one in october, one in Vegas in December and one in Jan/Feb in Tokyo

Please Join our Facebook Group to RSVP to the Event listed there.
We accept everyone, do not be dissuaded, the group is closed to keep the trolls out.

Couldnt the armory guy, just create a freature in the offline wallet, where all usb's are sandboxed, then every file  that doesnt fit the paramaters of a unsigned transaction file is deleted.

Bitcoin Brothers, Sisters and everything in-between, under and over. I would like to introduce the newly minted New York City Bitcoin facebook group. The purpose of this is so anyone in nyc can create events, ex post about having lunch at union square tomorrow. Really let's just hang out and create a great and vibrant community with bitcoins here in NYC. Please join, say hi and HAVE FUN.
@_date: 2013-07-17 05:22:42
yeah, I wasn't talking about or perception of physical objects rather the sense itself, like sound or light or touch.
Think, i can playfully punch you on the arm, or move just a hair on your arm and you will notice both at a FAR disproportionate (log) sensory level relative to what each would merit were it linear.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:00:07
I am so glad i did the exact same thing yesterday as well
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:42:14
well if you have nothing going on tonight, I'd strongly reccomend going to the Bitcoin and Drupal for fun and profit event

Bitcoins are a peer to peer payment processor.

It worked for us last time quite well.
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:42:56
Actually incorrect, all of our sensory inputs are on a log scale. ie Hearing/ Vision/ Touch / Smell.
In fact when teaching very young children about numbers they find our initial understanding of counting numbers is on a log scale as well.

Hi, I run up the BitcoinNYC meetup group, in the next month or so one of our events will be a monthly Merchant Adoption meetup where we talk to merchants about using Bitcoins, could we list you as a resource? Please pm me so we could talk further and as with everyone here, please feel free to join us at 
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:06:02
It was my understanding that this is already occurring all the time, further anyone who tries to day trade bitcoins, rather than using as a currency or buy/hold investment deserves what they get for getting their ass kicked by the professional scammers.

I can't speak to that as I don't manage those meetings, but if you would like find sellers or buyers in person, the same people go to my meetings, come to our thrusday one, email me your name and I can add you (our thrusday one has no more space but I'll do you a favor so you can get into the bitcoin game, email me at Jonathan (at) bitcoinNYC.org your name and I'll add you.

Hey, I'd love if I could get modded here and join in, I head up BitcoinNYC a bitcoin professional network that meets every Thursday, we had 42 people come out to our last meeting.
I'd love to see you guys come out to a meeting sometime!
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:03:00
that's so awesome, thanks man
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:50:34
It would be really important to me before buying that 
1. It was easy to make a paper wallet of the keys put on the device
2. The the device is peer reviewed to assure me this isn't a long con honey pot attack.

Hi i googled VWAP, but could you explain this concept in this context a little further? 
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:12:28
it was an example, the first meetup is at a starbucks on the 26th.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:49:15
sorry for being a dummy, but how does this work?
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:36:52
Government intervention either to make it illegal or to attempt to regulate it would massively increase the price of bitcoins as it will legitimize it either way to a massive market.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:21:20
I have yet to get a bitcoin meetup group (mostly because they charge money I never kenw that)
Though i think that facebook groups is FAR more condusive to creating a small community, meetup is only good for iffy new folk, right now I like the self-selecting dedication needed to friend a closed group. 
My plan is to get enough traction so that we meet every week, always going out to a bar afterwords. 
First week will be intro to noobs ie bring your friends and lets get em started
Second week will be intro and updates on bitcoin business and presuits - we will get people to talk about their own businesses, people who would like to partner up  and skype in/bring in people to talk about specific things on bitcoins
Third week will on vendor/brick and mortar adodption for noobs, ie get some shops and web folk to come in and have someone from bitpay skype in and get them sold on doing bitcoins for their store.
Fourth week will be futurism where we discuss the implications of a 2050 with bitcoins and josh around to get to know oneanother etc.

Hi, I'm doing exactly this with the BitcoinNYC ( ) group, as the  contributor to I'd love to get your input on the best form it should take.
