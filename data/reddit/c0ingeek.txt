Because your lotto requires participants to trust a complete stranger (you) to not run off with the loot! At least with BitBall there are plenty of reviews including at DeepDotWeb.com , it uses a "zero trust system" meaning that you don't have to trust "BitBall" to not "fabricate" the winning numbers as they use the first four winning numbers of the US Powerball numbers every Weds/Sat and they publish their winning payout transactions &amp; Tor Foundation donation transaction links on the blockchain to remain accountable. That is how a reputable bitcoin lottery operates!
