I mean, as a layman, you're really not in a position to make judgements like that. The majority of experts sharing an opinion is always for a good reason.

Nah, that's not a particularly mainstream opinion among economists, this paper just gives a great overview over the general reasons for inflation targets of 2%+. These reasons are explained throughout, so you shouldn't skip to the conclusion (i.e. "incomplete taxation, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, downward rigidity in nominal wages, and a quality bias in measured inflation").  
Even an inflation target of 4% has had more and more economists arguing for it recently as far as I'm aware.

I think considering deflation bad and inflation desirable is a pretty unanimous opinion across economic schools of thought. (As is the opinion that bitcoin will never be able to work as a currency because of intrinsic, unfixable errors, by the way, but I won't waste time trying to convince bitcoin enthusiasts of that)
Arguments from authority are *not* logical fallacies, and it's rather easy to see why (except if the authority is not actually an authority).


This is really not the right take away. Under their model, these reasons don't lead to an inflation rate significantly above zero. That's an important difference from them being "fallacious" (which is a term from the discipline of logic and rarely applicable).

Not a judgement that you can make, there really isn't anything about monetary policy we've learned from bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't money, after all.
Well, isn't linking that an appeal to authority too? ;)  
The page itself has a big paragraph titled "Exception", and for good reason: It's not actually a logical fallacy. A logical fallacy is an argument with little inductive strength, i.e., it's likely that the conclusion is false even if the premise is correct. This is obviously not the case for appeals to (proper) authorities and therefore, they're not logically fallacious (which you will find in all text books on the topic).


Just... no.


Which is exactly what I said. "These reasons don't lead to an inflation rate significantly above zero."


Again, a claim that you are in no position to make.

Right, like I said in my previous comment:


Which is why I linked it. If you want one of the more recent arguments for an inflation target of 4% that I mentioned, you could check out [this paper]( but I don't think it gives a good general look.

And arguments from authority are generally *really good* arguments to make, especially concerning topics you don't have extensive education in.  
That's beside the point, unless you want to say that the science of *economics* has a bad track record.

It's good. You could check the [economics subreddits]( or this paper for a more comprehensive [overview](
