create an account on bitcointalk and start reading the ANN pages for alts. look at what hashing algo is used and if there are GPUs or ASICs doing that. I looked into one called HOdlcoin because it's 1GB AES Pattern Search PoW and currently the miner is CPU-only. but they recently hard-forked to some sketchy year long auto deposit model so not sure if you'll find that suitable or not.

don't solo mine BTC on a laptop.
try a CPU coin or at least a low-difficulty GPU alt.

Got one saying it's not small and one saying it's not small or large.
Okay. I can accept that.
Conclusion: $4k/mo is an average amount, therefore nothing to get excited about.
