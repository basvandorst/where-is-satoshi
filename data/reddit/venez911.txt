Hello everyone. Thank you for the kind offers but I did say I would work. 
I do not want to get banned or do something wrong.  This post has been flagged for removal because someone thinks I’m asking for donations. 
I just meant help by offer work online for bitcoin. Not asking for donations or begging. 
Sorry to get it wrong.

Agree. I wouldn’t keep waiting for an “ideal price’ 
Bitcoin for investing is long term.  You will profit.

At the moment here in Venezuela it is taking off but our currency had to collapse for bitcoin to show its power. For now I am coverting 80% my salary into bitcoin ($15) a week before I start to spend it.

Hope it helps. 
There are several approaches, none of them are bullet-proof. Also, I'm not aware of any wallets supporting any of the approaches except "wait it out".
0) Wait it out. Even in April 2017, every now and then there is still almost free capacity from time to time where even low-fee transactions will pass; typically Sunday evenings. After 72 hours the transaction will be dropped by the network - though it's possible to rebroadcast it, both by the sender, receiver or any third-party.
1) Replace by Fee (RBF): Double-spend, as suggested by others, using a higher fee. By 2017 many miners will accept an RBF if and only if the transaction was sent with the "replacable"-flag set.
2) Child Pays for Parent: Spend the unconfirmed amounts (either the "change" amount or get the receiver to spend their received amount), with a higher transaction fee. Some wallets allow this and many miners will include the whole chain of transactions into the block if the fee is high enough. Except for  this may be the only option that is somewhat supported by many wallets - though you may need to move all of the wallet funds to force the wallet to spend the unconfirmed bitcoins.
3) As  but try to actively re-broadcast the transaction.
4) Ask the pools for help. viabtc has their "transaction accelerator" at  antpool.com also has some similar service, there even exists services where one can pay by credit card to get the transaction prioritized.
