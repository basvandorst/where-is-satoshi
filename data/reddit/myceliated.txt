he is very bright. and this is a true statement...insider trading is not unethical and is definitely a non-crime
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:42:53
because reddit
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:41:48
he is definitely an ancap. And insider trading is a non-crime
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:42:06
lol he identifies as such. he is starting a country with no government
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:42:58
yeah bitcoin has turned to shit
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:02:33
well i was actually in hong kong at the time and didn't have health insurance there so used the money to fly back to the states where i had health insurance and obviously had to pay a lot of money even with health insurance but not as much as I would have without it in hong kong. Ultimately my fault for not getting health insurance while in hong kong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:44
no... bitcoin has just been adopted by the mainstream. the people who were here early on still feel the same way such as me
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:36:07
Thank you! and yes that is one of its meanings haha but can mean other things as well such as the actual meaning of something being physically infused with mycelium.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:29:09
umm all of this was played with real instruments. including guitars, keyboards, drums as well as singing. there was absolutely no programmed sounds.. even sound effects were played with a keyboard.
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:24:24
hmm interesting. And I have fooled around with a similar concept but with the logo. I feel like it just disrupts the album art too much.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:28:32
Thanks! it's greatly appreciated :) If you'd like you can like the bands facebook page for updates. Should be releasing an EP in a couple of months. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:08:08
yeah I can understand that. My thought on the matter is that I would prefer to deal directly with the money and not go through any service. the beauty of bitcoin is that I have control of my own money and can deal directly with other people. It's more of a tip than purchasing the music. If they like the song they can tip.. if not they don't like it they dont have to pay anything.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:53:14
no thank you! you're awesome. greatly appreciate it :)
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:11:57
it is pay what you want though! in both fiat and btc... not sure what you mean.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:01:09
checking out your EP now, really like the fairytale track! And yeah that would be nice but I kind of like the idea of having a bitcoin qr code on the album.. shows that you support it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:18
I sold at $100... mined them when bitcoin was worth around $10 each. Unfortunately I had an injury and had no money to cover medical expenses so sold my bitcoin to pay for the costs.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:31:55
Thanks! means a lot me to me :). I'll be releasing an EP sometime early in 2016.  can follow updates on there if you'd like.

Just signed up and uploaded a song that's going to be on an ep I'm releasing in a few months. It's the only instrumental on the ep. If you like psychedelic funk have a listen!

nah, just only some universities .edu are in it, and for some reason they didnt make a list. I however got sent it because it's my cakeday! hurray!

ah I see, I always thought an address was a wallet. thanks for letting me know
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:55:06
more non bitcoin stuff please.
@_date: 2014-04-26 12:57:33
already did :) but I just realized I won't be able to watch it and participate live, as it is during my working hours :(
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:37:55
I just signed up with my .edu email address and I didn't get $10 in my account... how do i get it?
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:21:02
Ive been using coinbase with bank of america for about a year with no issues buying and selling bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:06:39
Was looking at the terms and conditions...  "Regarding 100% First Deposit Bonus for casino and sportsbook, player needs to purchase a minimum of $50 in the account currency and wager 10 times the amount of bonus for sportsbook and 20 times for casino before making any withdrawals. A minimum odds of 1.8 is applied to all sports bets. Cancelled bets are not counted to be deducted from wagering requirement amounts. Baseball moneyline, goal lines, asian handicap and financial bets are also not counted for wagering requirements unless specified otherwise." 
 10x the amount is quite a lot i think
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:49:40
definitely, even more of a moron to report this to media and show how stupid he is to the whole world.
@_date: 2014-01-29 07:45:13
in hong kong these are the ugly girls
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:14:38
in other news. a hong kong bitcoin exchange just opened up a physical shop where people can buy and sell bitcoin in person, and they also opened up the first bitcoin atm in hong kong and i think asia.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:41:53
oh ok, well thank you for clarifying! Is it going to be live for all .edu's eventually? and if I already signed up and got nothing will I get it later?
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:39:21
This is awesome! can't wait to play on may 1st!
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:21:31
I had a transaction the other day for around the same amount cancelled because of a high risk. There was really no reason and I didn't use tor. I'm not sure why they do this but sometimes it just seems random. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:52:18
Has anyone heard of this? is it legit? they have shares on cryptostocks.com  	
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:52:29
How? If people aren't satisfied they hire another company.

I was about to register and verify myself and then I saw that you ask for SSN. I'm not sure if i feel comfortable giving you that information. I've never given that at any exchange I've used. Is there an alternative?
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:37:44
That's awesome that you've been tipped and now seem to be getting even more tips. I've had my bitcoin address on youtube and soundcloud since 2011 and never been tipped. .007 btc  @_date: 2014-05-08 18:17:17

not to be confused with softcore tranny
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:30:14
depends on the altcoin. Altcoins such as namecoin which the sole purpose of the currency is to purchase decentralized dns aren't and will work together with bitcoin.. or possibly with an even more anonymous altcoin such as stablecoin.
@_date: 2014-11-14 05:14:56

@_date: 2014-04-10 07:25:55
With this news is there going to be an influx of mainland chinese buying and selling bitcoin in hong kong?
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:40:48
What is the crime here? I mean if it is for selling bitcoin to the undercover agent who said it was for purchasing stolen credit cards then that is entrapment. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:21:09
that feel when you mined 10 coins when bitcoin was worth less than 10 dollars and sold them at 100 each a month before they got to 1000 :(
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:51:40
nice try
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:20:34
why didnt you atleast try using bitcoinbuilder.com? I actually made a profit using it

@_date: 2014-02-08 09:36:48
They do? if this is the case why not have a friend setup a phishing site and do this? seems like easy money

love the work you are doing. The company has grown a lot since I first registered on your exchange about 6 months ago. You have done me a great service in helping me move money from usd to hkd. Btw are you hiring for any positions? I would love to get involved with a bitcoin business in someway. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:44:30
Interested to see what locations in hong kong are going to have robocoin atm's.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:32:48
seems every time coinbase sends me bitcoin or I send bitcoin or receive it coinbase creates a new wallet
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:40:18
but whats the point in that? overall it's bad pr to have people sign up promising something and then theres nothing. it is better to have less people sign up after posting the list. because  people signing up are not likely to use coinbase if they are denied what they are promised.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:56:03
someone I wish I could bump into and scam... does that make me a bad person? I've never scammed anyone but thinking about having that kind of money and how life changing that would be for me is tempting.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:25:39
no, I think I have somewhere near 100 wallets on coinbase.. so not each wallet is one person.

A modern day business woman gets home from a hard day at work and when she walks into her room she commands that her husband take off her shoes, so he does. Then she says " Now take off my dress" and he does. "Now take off my underwear, and I never want to catch you wearing them again!"

I'm in the same situation. I bought a substantial amount of bitcoin at around $800 after it had been been hovering in that price range for quite awhile. I thought, I should buy now as I'm pretty sure the price is going to rise soon. I consistently transfer money using bitcoin as I am living overseas, So I thought I'll make a gain in this.. I couldn't have been more wrong. Thanks Gox.

you don't realize it isn't just about money. the bitcoin blockchain will allow us to decentralize everything that can be decentralized such as voting.
@_date: 2014-08-19 12:57:33
Umm this list is missing some very important things such as no fees that they would get with credit cards and paypal.- this in my opinion is the one that will win most merchants as they have nothing to lose to accept it. If they use bitpay they pay absolutely nothing when someone pays in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:41:02
I really want to try this stuff but I can't get any for awhile I guess as I am in asia and not in the usa :(

Yes, I live in hong kong and this is the only way I transfer money between my us bank account and my hk bank account. I will buy bitcoin on coinbase and then transfer the bitcoin to a hk exchange or localbitcoins. I then sell the bitcoins for hkd which goes directly into my bank account. Many times I actually makes gains doing this.

On 16 November 2013, Norman Chan, the chief executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said that bitcoins is only a virtual commodity. He also decided that bitcoins will not be regulated by HKMA. However, the authority will be closely watching the usage of bitcoins locally and its development overseas. 
Does that answer your question?

the trick of bitcoinbuilder was to buy gox btc and then sell it again for real btc for a profit. i gained .1 btc by doing so
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:18:18
yes, also,I bought some gox btc at .37 on bitcoin builder and then sold it back for real btc at .43 each.. not a huge profit but profit none the less.

they can also use localbitcoins
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:18:10
this song is really awesome btw.cant wait to hear their album.  if you are accepting bitcoin it's best to not use a third party as bandcamp does take money from sales. and with a bitcoin qr code you can bypass that. also they can try using  but this will be free downloads with an option to tip.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:31:37

@_date: 2014-02-25 03:16:48
Does this mean people can no longer trade internally then? so bitcoin builder wont work now? or what is the deal here.
@_date: 2014-04-25 07:32:17
This is a great idea. Dark Market will be attacked by the media as being underground and illegal and everyone who is not familiar with bitcoin and this same ideology will not want to be involved with it or bitcoin. Naming it free market is perfect!

it already has enabled anarchism, and more is being done using blockchain technology to enable more decentralized systems. Government can easily be replaced by decentralized systems. I also find it a bit humorous how you constantly attack without any real sustenance to your argument. You just say im close minded and childish for being an anarchist. I'm sorry that I have morals and I believe that governments are immoral as everything they do is through violence. I'm sorry i don't agree with your religion(statism)

I am facepalming so hard reading this comments. If a merchant uses bitpay they pay no fees. If they use paypal or credit cards they get charged fees plus they have to worry about chargebacks. There are no chargebacks with bitcoin and no transaction fees if you are using bitpay. Bitpay will also convert the bitcoin to fiat automatically, or you can get a certain percentage in fiat and keep some in bitcoin.

1. yeah pretty much. Anarchy means no government.
2. no, that is anarchy if the government isn't involved whatsoever.
3. in an anarchist society, that child would have a much better chance in making something of himself and joining the market, than in a society regulated by the government where the wealthy keep the poor out of the marketplace.. and what you are saying is part of life no matter what the government does to try and "Help" people by stealing money from others. It is not immoral to do better than someone in life, it is immoral to steal from someone which is what the government does.

Axelrod asked Paul whether he would try to overturn Roe v. Wade and ban abortion outright if he were president. Paul responded that even though he personally believes life begins at conception and that abortion is wrong, the country is too divided on the issue for him to try to ban the procedure entirely.
“I think where the country is, is somewhere in the middle, and we are not changing any of the laws until the country is persuaded otherwise,” Paul said.
Conservatives were not pleased with his answer.

anyone have any ideas on how to get started on such a project?
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:27:20
can you do some more research on a candidate before you spout this nonsense? He doesn't believe in the federal government being involved in either of these things and that states and city governments should decide as they are societal issues(abortion). As for environmental he believes the market should be able to choose what they want. Corporations use the government to keep others out of the market. Rand Paul wants limited government where innovative companies can compete in the market. He has also stated he wants to remove taxes and regulations placed on alternative fuel companies.
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:58:10
deals with taking a possible life.. so i understand that stance. If you believe in the Non aggression principle I think you have to view abortion as a violation to that principle.

@_date: 2015-04-08 03:25:04
a good article on his environmental stances. 
While saying he's not against some regulations, such as on carbon emissions and clean water, Paul said he plans on introducing legislation "in the next month or so" that would cut regulation of alternative fuels.
"I'm for trying to get the government out of the way of converting your trucks from diesel to natural gas, or from gasoline to ethanol," he said. "And try to let the marketplace take care of this, because some of these fuels are actually cheaper, too, and if they're cheaper then people will go for a cheaper alternative that also is cleaner for the environment."
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:10:43
true, but this seems perfect for it.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:43:24
I agree, that's what makes ron paul awesome but it wont win in this neocon controlled country. It also makes it hard to support rand since who knows his true stance and what he will do when elected. However, he's the best candidate so far.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:06:29
explain what you mean about nearly everything else about him
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:23:37
is this how you debate people? He doesn't believe in government involvement, and as president he wouldn't be imposing any laws or regulations dealing with environmental issues or abortion issues. He would let the states and local governments deal with societal issues. He has also stated he would remove the regulations and taxes on alternative fuels. he stands for a freer market where the people can actually choose and innovation can thrive. Big Corporations use the government to keep others out of the market through licensing, regulations, and tariffs

ok satoshi first posted on 
p2p foundation was founded by Michel Bauwens who regards p2p technologies as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. also satoshi emailed Hal Finney who was a noted cryptographic activist. During the early 1990s, Hal Finney was a regular poster on the cypherpunks listserv. the first ever bitcoin transaction was between satoshi and Finney.
also here's some more emails by satoshi in the early days with more cypherpunk references. 
yes i too am a slave, we were born slaves but I'm not ok with it as it seems you are which is what i was getting at by saying enjoy since you clearly enjoy it.

But what if I were to buy an apple, take it home and take out the seeds and grow an apple tree from them and produce my own apples? is that theft? copying something isn't stealing, and when you torrent something that is what you are doing.

why does it matter whether it's in a reddit comment or not? the government is way too far gone to be fixed. Not to mention everything that governments do is by force which is immoral, why would you let a government do something to you that you wouldn't let a person do to you? bitcoin was created in order to replace the current financial system which governments use to keep their power. the root of the problem is the financial system.

Giving games away for less and then offering a range of optional, micro-transactions at a variety of prices may be a better deal than demanding a one-time $50 to $60 retail purchase for everyone involved.
Likewise, providing free games (or portions thereof) up front, then rewarding those who choose to buy in with a steady stream of high-quality downloadable extras or added adventures, could be a better model. Putting digital diversions in more people's hands and letting them pay what they want, when they want, has the potential to massively expand gaming's reach and profitability. The majority of the industry is going about it wrong, and the ones who adopt this style are going to profit the most.

lol start reading philosophy.. how vague. There are so many philosophies and philosophers that believe different things, and I'm quite familiar. Also, the concept of theft is not a blurry line at all. It's pretty straight forward.
"If taxation without consent is robbery, the United States government has never had, has not now, and is never likely to have, a single honest dollar in its treasury. If taxation without consent is not robbery, then any band of robbers have only to declare themselves a government, and all their robberies are legalized"

Defacement of currency is a violation of Title 18, Section 333 of the United States Code. Under this provision, currency defacement is generally defined as follows: Whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

the government owns us and does whatever it wants. Civil forfeiture means that it can take your belongings without ever charging you with a crime
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:58:30
this is true.. although most Hong Kongers would prefer cantonese or english over mandarin. Mandarin is good to know though for sure especially if you are working with mainland chinese.
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:16:03
haha it's ok, i used to live there ;)
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:29:37
my profile picture is a qr code of my face.. seems simple enough right?
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:30:38
I agree, but it is possible that the government or U.S. Mint could decide that it can't be reissued. The government can and does whatever it wants
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:23:22
do you use a third party service for this or does your company pay you directly in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:02:37
hmmmm didn't know about this. I'll test this out and see if that makes a difference. thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:40:48
lol exactly
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:29:18
we shall see.. It has been approved for test driving on European roads so I imagine we shall be seeing them in the near future.

As a musician I wouldn't even want band camp to accept it.. I'll just accept it directly

@_date: 2015-03-21 19:43:00
nope, I upload the picture i want to turn into a halftone qr code. then i enter in the public key address for which i also own the private key :)
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:38:46
try this
@_date: 2015-03-22 08:38:33
hmm interesting find. Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:01:17
1 bitcoin per cent of fiat transactions?
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:24:08
i thought that was obvious...
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:56:40
K I'll post a YouTube video here in the next week for you.
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:41:46
ok so whos the banker that downvoted me?
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:49:16
i think it had to do with the size of it. I'm having no issues at all now after making the qr code bigger.  let me know if it's the same for you
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:01:13
fuck voorhees
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:10:04
it's only a matter of time. Our current financial system is so fucked and outdated
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:10:01
why do you think that?
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:55:33
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:24:41
so you think theft is ok? and show me the statistics of taxation in various first world countries. I've lived overseas and where I lived the taxation is very very low. Not to mention the United States is one of the only countries that you have to pay taxes even when you don't live in that country. The revolutionary war was fought over taxation and we are far more taxed now than they were.
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:14:30
thanks for the feedback! I'm trying to figure out the issue. If i scan it using my phones regular barcode scanner app it will scan on imgur but not with 2 different bitcoin wallet apps. It scans fine with my bitcoin wallet app scanner when i download it onto my computer though... so weird.

I have an ep coming out in a few months that will feature a bitcoin qr code on the cover art.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:17:05
Also, if anyone wants to hear the music I make I have one unmixed song uploaded that is going to be released on an ep in the next few months. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:26:18
Yeah.. seems a lot harder to get looking good.. but I suppose with enough time you can get it looking crisp and legible
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:42:45
yeah i enlarged it, I think it should scan immediately now. 
thanks for the feedback :)
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:52:52
strange.. works perfect for me now. which app are you using?
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:23:23
I'll be adding that to my EP that's coming out in a few months
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:18:50
It matters because we are less free than most countries. And yes I am an anarchist. I agree that anarchy hasnt worked throughout history, but they didn't have blockchain technology. It is now possible to have an anarcho capitalist society using this technology
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:55:52
NIce! looking forward to seeing what comes out of this. have a few unmixed tracks uploaded atm. I make psychedelic music.
 
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:32:47
and no one would go to jail if the majority of people stopped paying taxes, that is the point im getting at. Theft is never ok, we don't need the government or it's services. Decentralize and privatize everything!
@_date: 2015-03-30 02:14:12
umm other countries let you retain citizenship without paying taxes to it when you don't live there. crackpot libertarian ideals? libertarian ideals are the same as the founders of the united states. Also, technically I'm not a libertarian as I believe government is immoral. Everything the government does is through violence and I am not ok with that. I believe in the non aggression principle. Libertarians want limited government, I want no government. Why would you let the government do something that you wouldn't let a person do to you? 
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:30:13
awesome! keep up the good work. Talk more about decentralization and other decentralized projects maybe?
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:18:39
If only everyone would just stop paying taxes
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:37:12
either hire someone to make your website or learn how to do it before you make one..
@_date: 2015-03-21 11:01:41
that is really weird considering it scans on my coinbase app immediately hahaha wtf is happening
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:59:35
once they ban cash we'll have bitcoin as digital cash
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:22:59
you can always get paid in bitcoin! and I buy bitcoin when its low and dont spend it for awhile. Once it has higher value i start using it to buy things. or I can sometimes get discounts using bitcoin from certain websites. I do everything online. Going to actual stores isnt worth it. I can order delivery from a lot of locations and pay with bitcoin. SO if you can get a discount why not convert some fiat to bitcoin and pay right after?
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:02:14
He could've he just didn't know how. You can pay bills with bitcoin using  there are other services that do it too. Also that one merchant that has a $25 limit is ridiculous. If he uses bitpay it will convert it to fiat automatically if he so chooses. There is no way he is going to lose money from doing a bitcoin transaction.

Bought one of these on bitcoin black friday. My first bitcoin purchase :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:31:29
Too lazy to read. Did you ask why they never let their customers know when they have technical issues?
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:24:30
Their website is prettier, I think I will use them instead.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:01:20
it's anarcho capitalism in action

Yes! This is great news for expats like me. Although bitcoin isnt very big in hong kong. The banking industry is huge here.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:55:52
I was thinking that they would be making shirts that have bitcoin wallets on the shirt.. like their qr code would be on their shirt.. could this be a cool idea?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:36:42
I regret not investing half of my money into a building a desktop for mining bitcoin 2 years ago when after I mined 10 bitcoins my motherboard fried due to my graphics card being too powerful for it and constantly running cguiminer.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:16:38

How can it be funded by visa and mastercard? I only see payza and okpay as possible methods of depositing money
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:43:54
it was at 260 not too long ago and the bubble burst and went down to 50.. so same thing could happen here and most likely will
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:50:45
Yeah, theres also hong kong massage.. and I tell a lot of people in Hong Kong when I meet them about bitcoin. My girlfriend did a presentation on bitcoin at her university and another on litecoin
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:58:04
Does anyone know how this will affect Hong Kong?
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:25:15
Why should I use you instead of  ?
Their website layout is much prettier
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:32:16
I didn't even know you existed...
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:05:00
huh? how will half of them be gone forever?
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:05:03
or mBTC for short
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:57:50
ah I see, yeah I already have a qr code on my youtube, would anyone like to listen or watch?    song I wrote and recorded awhile back.. still needs to be mixed better. I write mostly psychedelic rock and jazz.. but I'm all over the place
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:45:32
oh yeah don't know why I didn't think of that
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:02:38
I'm so excited to see how bitcoin will evolve and the ingenius apps people develop to take it to the moon!
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:59:04
