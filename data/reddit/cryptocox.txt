Why do you make this assumption? Maybe Coinbase asks more invasive questions than necessary. Maybe their business model is the collection of information on bitcoiners. Many people have reported that Coinbase asks far more invasive questions than their banks. There's probably a reason for that.
Even assuming the best of intentions, I don't respect people who engage in this kind of information gathering as a condition of doing business in the US. I have much more respect for people who leave the US to avoid it.
I don't respect Coinbase, or any of the people involved in Coinbase. I think they're bad people. I'm sure they won't lose sleep over that.

Hey, polite Erik is back. :) I don't see it as censorship. It's freedom of association.

And live: 
It'll be interesting to see if they revert. I think they did the right thing. Coinbase should be avoided for many reasons.

I think it's a mistake to remove Coinbase from the "Choose your Wallet" page. They should move them to a special "Warning" section instead.

Eh, "Bitcoin Judas" gives him too much importance. I think he should be known as *Bitcion Jesus* since "Bitcion" is what he wrote in the tweet. (The OP kindly corrected it for him.)

I lot of us are thinking the same thing we've thought for a long time: Fuck Coinbase. Coinbase asks unnecessary and invasive questions and closes accounts if they don't get the answers they want. The behavior of *Coinbase* has been *outrageous* for a very long time. Should they have been deleted for running XT? Eh, honestly, I don't care. I'm happy with Coinbase getting deleted for any reason.
As you could probably guess I'm a fan of your projects, so don't take it personally. I suspect you're defending Coinbase for what you believe are noble reasons. But, seriously, it's well past time for Coinbase to go fuck itself.
If it'll make people feel better, maybe the bitcoin.org owners could send Coinbase a polite letter explaining why they can no longer do business with them. That's what Coinbase does. Over. And over.

I would support Core changing the PoW to prevent this ongoing political attack. I think I found the comments you referred to:

Core has the option of changing the PoW algorithm. I hope they take this option.

Thanks for pointing me to this new work of Luke Jr. After a year of infighting, firing the miners and scorching the Earth looks like the best option.

Maybe the title was too long, so most redditers didn't read it.

I agree with you, Adam. I know one of the options under consideration is to hardfork Bitcoin Core to use a different PoW. If the Core devs decide to do this, I'll support and defend it.

I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking along these lines. If there are enough of us, we can keep the original Bitcoin chain going (one way or another) in spite of what these people are doing.
The rules of the protocol might actually be safer from attack if this massive long term attack fails to destroy the original chain -- even if it succeeds in creating a second chain.
