Does anyone know what'll happen to any fiat currency held in mtgox accounts? How would one go about making sure that they get their share of the bankruptcy?

Well... You can't make full scale experiments but behavioural economics can give you some insight into human behaviour. Though it is very hard to generalize any findings.

Working for the TSA, FBI or any other security related organization is a good indication that a person is trying to pass for normal while still learning classified information about our nations security.
We would therefore ask all professionals to watch out for suspicious behaviour like wearing a suit, driving a black car and/or using the word "ma'am" while trying to ask you questions.

One major difference is that the Federal reserve is privately owned by the banks. In most countries the central bank is publicly owned (though often independent). What differences this makes in practice is hard for me to judge.

How traceable are bitcoins?

BitCents works, but may I suggest using the prefix as a prefix? DeciBits, CentiBits, MilliBits, MicroBits etc.

So... you could actually make some money if you just equalized the prices between the exchanges? Hmmm...

This is because everyone who knows anything about bitcoins and economics will come to similar conclusions: Speculation is driving the price increase, you can't buy much yet, a crash could possibly come at any time, a crash might kill the currency and it might turn out to be just another (admittedly decentralized) pyramid scheme. These are obvious worries that anyone should have. This does not however change the fact that it's an interesting concept since it might just work.
edit: Or it might be because both are written by Robert Cyran

I'm starting to get a bit worried. There is obviously a bubble going on since most people who are buying bitcoins are just speculating at this stage. This might scare off entrepreneurs from taking payments in this currency.
