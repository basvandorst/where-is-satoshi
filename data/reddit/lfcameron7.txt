Not this again 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:57:39
Sad but true. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:34:40
What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:57:57
No problem, just be aware that prices on both those sites are always above normal market prices 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:39:10
You can usually buy on localbitcoins if you're under 18, you can also try Coinify 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:47:40
True ;) but they will be more profitable to you 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:21:02
Not worth venturing into bitcoin mining now, look at other cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:08:39
Hold it and forget about it, come back to it in a years time 
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:30:31
I've just started reading "Cryptocurrency: The Future of Money?" by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:41:08
Find the transaction on  look at the transaction fee and work out how long it will take at  :)
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:43:30
If you scroll across it tells you the time it will take 
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:22:56
I've just downloaded Blockfolio, only app I've used that has working price notifications 
@_date: 2017-02-24 08:08:54
You're correct 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:12:47
1000th person to make this joke, get banned, bye 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:33:56
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:29:35
2.5% is still a shockingly high fee, no matter if it's lower than credit card processing fees 
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:01:15
BU really are digging a hole for themselves 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:30:40
You should use a pool that signals for whatever path you believe Bitcoin should take
If you support Segwit, the top 6 mining pools signaling Segwit are listed [here](
If you support BU, the top 6 mining pools signaling BU are listed [here]( 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:29:06
Woop, who's next?

BUY THE DIP
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:06:37
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:18:20
As you can see [here]( your fees were pretty low (yours were 19 satoshis per byte) 
You can use this [site]( to try and get your transaction accelerated (included in the next block) 
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:04:23
meh, this is becoming a daily occurrence now 
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:50:40
FAKE NEWS!!
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:51:12
THERE IS HOPE!!

@_date: 2017-03-10 14:34:10
I'm 17, sent in my ID to Coinbase and I was approved, I guess they don't even check the date of birth on the ID 
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:04:19
Didn't they activate it on testnet?
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:35:25
With the  wallet you are free to set the fees yourself, refer to  to help you decide on a fee. 
We are all hoping that the issue of rising transaction costs is soon dealt with, through the activation of something called segwit which will allow the current block size limit to be increased. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:33:37
Yes 
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:15:00
Post saved! My Raspberry Pi Zero W is arriving today! 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:27:26
Fucking stop it's not funny
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:07:10
that's not a ban put in place by mods, right? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:32:48
Money is a medium of exchange 
Characteristics of good money: 
- Portable
- Durable
- Store of value
- Divisible 
- Widely accepted by population &lt;- Bitcoin's goal in my opinion  
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:31:29
Buy the dip as per usual :)
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:48:34
I think this was posted more to spark a discussion about what effect this will have on the value of bitcoin

They released a press statement like last week covering what they would do in the result of a fork
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:21:16
Old article but hadn't seen anything about it in this sub before! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:28:40
Because the tickets are sold through an external site, which doesn't support Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:26:23
SegWit won't become active until approx August 21st
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:02:13
This will be huge, imagine the media attention Bitcoin will get!

@_date: 2017-01-04 22:43:42
1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:56:33
SegWit will be active on approx Aug 21st I believe 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:41:44
TenX 
@_date: 2017-01-15 16:50:41
I think I worded this wrong, I meant a crypto exchange, for like day trading 
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:39:17
Literally any real life purchase would be a good use case for LN
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:10:44


That's when the real revolution starts 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:25:28
Sweet, thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:37:33
This is a pretty cool bot 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:41:03
Holy shit, now this is a pretty cool way to raise awareness 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:14:02
I respect this, shows that they clearly had good intentions. There's nothing worse for the community than to be divided.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:10:59


People are paying what they have to pay.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:54:57

Imagine how high we'll go once segwit is activated
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:51:53
Just wait for the news articles now 
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:27:31
UI is clean af, would love support for more cryptos!
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:27:44
Well it certainly has acted as an amazing inflation hedge for Venezuelans over the past couple years

Makes no sense. You'll still have to submit ID right? That's literally the only step? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:47:43
TenX uses the exchange rate at the time of purchase with a 0% fee 
Why is it not listed on here?

Nope, August 1st

Let us know what they say 
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:49:39
It wouldn't be sexist to assume this anyway since over 90% of the crypto community is male

The 'socialism' in Europe is nowhere near as extreme as the socialism in Venezuela
