About tree fiddy. 
Not even joking. I have about $3.50 worth of bitcoin at the moment. Never has that phrase been so satisfying.

I don't have to be too worried if he's the one in charge of figuring out my identity.

Definitely feel free to ask questions, but it would be pretty difficult to explain all of bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:39:44
Never.

I can't speak for the first banning as it seemed stupid to be banned. I can't speak for the 9999 minute mute either. But the last one was pretty deserved. They asked you to take it to pm. You kept causing trouble. Kind of asked to be muted man. The last time anyway. The others seem like bullshit. 
The mods do seem like little bitches though
Edit: I know never to go there at least

You've fallen for OP's trap
@_date: 2014-09-18 04:22:28
Not exactly accurately portrayed, but then again it's not exactly a "good place"

I really really really enjoy this idea. Honestly I wish the bitcoin community had a bit of the doge coin community's generosity. I completely understand the desire to invest your bitcoins, but if all you're doing is investing and not spending.... You're bitcoins are going to be useless. I think I'll be throwing some bitcoin people's way when they won't let me pay for something from now on :)

Why would you block out their customer service number lol.

Look at the links on the sidebar, then ask questions if you still have them.

Just sent 30btc
But not really. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:28:27
Read my post again. I made some edits to answer your question better. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:35:35
The horror! 
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:52:18
I remember buying 6 bitcoin... I sold them for $60 a piece... Paid $30 a piece... Shortly after... They rose to $1000 a piece. Needless to say I'm not good at waiting. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:21:28
Yes. And therefore you should plan risks accordingly and never let the risk become more than you can handle. 
Meaning don't buy more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:26:03
Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. 
Buy as much as you can afford to lose. If that's $100 then buy $100 worth. 
If you can afford to lose more, buy more.
Buying bitcoin as an investment is a risk. It could drop and only be worth pennies. 
So I'll say again, buy as much as you can afford to lose. 
It is a very volatile currency.

Being a small business and being incompetent does not equal being a large chain and having breaches arise. When you have that many cogs in the machine, you're bound to have issues arise from incompetent workers, not the incompetent corporations as a whole. Not to say it doesn't happen, but more often than not it ends up being a fairly isolated incident at these types of locations. 
I do see your point, I'm just playing Devils advocate. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:20:15
I sense a romance brewing. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:21:11
I don't think bitcoin has much to do with the price of gold... 
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:25:38
Try purse.io maybe? 
@_date: 2015-11-23 03:29:12
You're pretty outta luck bud. That's why you quadruple check the address 
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:08:20
That was my first thought... 
Gonna trust my gut on this one. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:40:29
Nice subtle reference link. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:25:01
Now you're trying to hard. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:34:36
Doesn't sound suspicious at all. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:47:42
You can buy drugs. 
I'm sure I'll get down voted for this.
