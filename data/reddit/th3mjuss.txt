Isn't it worth to buy mining hardware anymore ?

So if I understood well:
* get the private key from my seed using a script offline
* import the private key to an offline wallet
* get online and send directly the coins
Did I understood correctly ?

Thanks for your answer. I think I understood the concept but I wonder how I can know the size of my transaction in bytes ?

I know, every time I start it I have to repair my wallet because all my money is unconfirmed.. but know I have to wait to get my money back. I'll change afterwards :)

Good to know !
And how long does that take ?

I used multibit HD, and I didn't get any warning.. so I lost my money ? :-(

The receiving address is indeed under my control. For what I know, there is "only" two unconfirmed transactions, which are the ones we talked about above. Could we talk about that by MP, it would maybe be easier ?

I found a solution. Add my transaction to viabtc. Long live big blocks ! It solved everything. Thanks for your help.

Are you sure about that ? I made a transaction with a fee of 70.796 sat/B and it is still unconfirmed on my wallet. I may say something dumb, please correct me if I'm wrong.

I guess I am. And it took less than an hour.

Thanks for your answer, I also thought of exporting private key but I use the "HD" version, which creates BIP32 wallets.. Can I just recover my wallet into electrum with my seeds ?

Thanks for the answers !

Now I understand. So I guess I have to fix [this issue]( first. I wish I understood how fees work sooner...
