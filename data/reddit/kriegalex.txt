The problem doesn't lie with people not understanding bitcoin, it lies with people still uncomfortable with technology. People can easily understand that bitcoin is kind of like their usual money but "in computers". An app that lets you pay in bitcoin is not that different from whatever app is available in your country with your bank, or Samsung, Apple, Google.
The fact is that the majority of the cashiers I have met have no clue about what I'm doing with my smarpthone when I pay with it and most of them just know what button to press if the customer wants to pay "with its smartphone". It's not a bad thing to not know but it shows the state in which we are. Some of them didn't even know you could do that even if the logos of the company/credit card (MCARD, AMEX, Google, Apple, Samsung) was on the payment terminal. 
If you are not convinced, try to speak with a millenial and assess his or her familiarity with popular technologies versus someone from the 90s. Don't need to go that much back in time.

You just have to ask for the average temps while mining first. If the guy doesn't know or it is way above 60°C, go to the next ad. 
Also one can ask how much warranty is left. If there is still like 1.5-2 years warranty, it's a nobrainer:
* It didn't mine that much so it will be fine
* It is gonna break but it will go under warranty
Of course only worth the effort if way below MSRP.
