Uh, no? That's one flavor of Linux.
Linux is Linux is Linux. If it's got extra shit hung off the kernel then it's just extra shit hung off the kernel. It's still Linux.
Just because I put a water bed and a camper shell on my pickup truck doesn't make it not a pickup truck. It makes a really pimp pickup truck, even if I had to pay Certa for the proprietary water bed.

Very interesting. It's unfortunate that Bitmain has such a monopoly in the market.
[Remember that Samsung is also developing ASIC miners, although we do not know what form they will ultimately take.](
I'll be posting a video and DIY how-to later on for making your own quiet, compact, apartment-sized ASIC farm running up to 5,760W of processing power. (24A @ 240V, or about 6 L3+s or 4 T9+s)

Check out the bait-and-switch Venezuela is doing.

Edit: Seriously though, Jakesonwu makes a good point. If one gets a disproportionate amount of BTC into American hands and then prints the fuck out of the USD - which a significant portion of world debt is denominated in, one could pull off a Nicholas-Cage level switcheroo.
It's just the same type of economic violence we've seen internally here in America played on a world scale.

Yup, and they're all tuned to a near-zero rate environment on the forward leverage ratios.
What's DPZ going to do when their rates go from 4% to 6% on debt? I think they hold both variable APR accounts and accounts that will need to be refinanced within two years. A lot of companies do.
The Fed just announced they're accelerating rate increases.

We need to define "market."
If by market we mean changes to the underlying technology, new applications for the technology, or marked upticks in adoption of said technology, then yes, these are material developments.
All of these things have a material impact upon the fundamental quality of the financial service provided by cryptocurrencies as a class. This financial service is the primary value to the people adopting it, and adoption and use are the ultimate drivers of value within this environment.

It's way beyond me at that point. The impact Bitcoin is having on the world is paradigm changing, and I'm not that much of a visionary.
I think history has seen large wealth imbalances under both inflationary and deflationary currency schemes.
I think it may have more to do with the underlying social mechanisms that have become so intertwined with the current financial system that a lot of people blame the USD's failings on. The USD's management is a failure, yet I think it's a failure because it was leveraged as a tool to increase churn within the middle class, thus driving consumerism.
The USD had potential, and then it was squandered by those we entrusted it to. Just like a lot of other things in the country currently...
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:14:27
What if I proposed that either inflation or deflation could be sustainable if done in a predictable and measured fashion?
The main failings of any system usually occur when hyperinflation or hyperdeflation occur, i.e. *exceptional* volatility compared to the norm. This debases the currency just as we saw happen to Bitcoin last year.
The USD's constant, structured inflation is offset by certain financial instruments to balance the money-machine out. The problem is only certain parties can really acquire the offset instruments, thus leading to the extreme imbalance of wealth we've seen develop since the 70's.

At this point all it could do is accelerate adoption, and if it's distracting people from the natural network-forming action we're seeing then it's not even doing that.
We are seeing genesis. This is akin to the way cells divide, specialize, are deemed necessary or unnecessary, and are supported or removed during the our formative time in the womb.
Crypto is the body, and we will have a few good coins as "organs" within that body, and within each of those organs the users, nodes, and miners (in that order) will be the cells that drive them.

He's not being misleading. Android is just Linux with a nice GUI.
Windows is just the latest NT kernel with Windows Shell on top of it.

That is the more complex answer, yes, and it is a pita, yes. XD 3.2 isn't bad, though. The harder ones were earlier when ssl boke.
Now you'e got me thinking - I don't recall seeing a lot of discussion on how the current role of credit may be fulfilled in a Bitcoin economy. Payment problems aside it is important that any cryptocurrency candidate (cryptocandidate?) be assessed on its ability to fulfill all of the influential functions of the current financial marketplace.

I find it telling that so many have come back around in such short order.
I'll tell you - this sideways market with the underlying inflation characteristic is a very strong indicator of underlying hodler strength. Add in to this that *Lightning Network* is already running and *it's fucking great* and how can anyone bet against it?
Also, the markets are going to shit themselves in like four hours. Have fun, everyone! :D

The consumer pays for all costs + margins for everybody up the chain.
The VISA charge is paid by the customer.
Reducing or removing the VISA charge would decrease prices by reducing the total cost of the good or service provided.

How much is your merchant paying on the flip-side?
Would this system still function if everyone acquired, and used, 2% cash-back cards at that merchant?
Would the issuing card company then be forced to increase the rate fee % charged to the merchant to make up for the increased cash payouts for member benefits? The major card issuers are bound by investor demands.
Would the merchant, bound by margins and potential investors, be forced to up his prices in accordance to the issuing company's fee increases to maintain his margin target?
Interesting mechanics for a "deflationary asset."

This is a prototype rig I've developed. It is built around the Bitmain 2-fan model.
Note the smoke alarm on top, and I have fire extinguishers around, too. Safety first!
Currently there is a 10-gauge extension feeding a Tripp-Lite 30A 240V/208V Power Distribution Unit (PDU). From there I have 4 Antminer S7's bought used on Ebay running at full speed. The fans currently spin at about 3,200rpm, much slower than the 4,400RPM at factory speeds. This produces between 18TH to 19TH/s sustained.
Coming out of the back I have 4" primaries feeding 6" collectors. Two primaries per collector, and each collector is vented with a 440CFM / 120V 6" centrifugal fan to the outside.
We can stand next to this rig and have a slightly elevated conversation. I wouldn't want to stay in the room for more than an hour or so, but I don't have any trouble sleeping in the room next to it. I can't hear it with the bedroom door shut.

This is taken within the context of WW3 or some other cataclysm.
There would be no additional hashpower to influx.
We would simply be stuck until it re-adjusted.
That said, I think our bitcoin would be of little worry in such an event. How much food, water, and ammunition you have would probably be of more concern.

There is a problem.
Say the diff adjusts to a hashrate of 100H/s. It re-adjusts every 10 blocks. It processes a block every 10 minutes. So every 100 minutes it re-adjusts at 100H/s.
Say we lost 99.9% of that. We now operate at 00.1H/s.
We now have 10 blocks to find, because we are unlucky, before it re-adjusts.
It could take 100,000 minutes to find all 10 blocks, or nearly 70 days.
Now re-adjust these  for bitcoin and the problem becomes clear.
