Yeah, just think what would have happened if she showed her ankle god forbid ��

Are you me? I had an argument this morning about the same thing.

We'd need someone to spearhead it that is well known and trusted in the crypto space. Any ideas?

Here's my 2 satoshis.
It actually good in this stage to hodl. It continues to drive the price up, thus being an increasingly attractive investment for more and more people. 
This is Gresham's law at work. People don't want to give up their good investment, so will give up their crappy fiat money first, since it's not making them as much money (actually loosing purchasing power over the log run.)
However, as more people hodl and becomes more main stream, and crypto gains currency market share, Thier's law will start to kick in, as more people don't want to take rapidly depreciating fiat. This will be a "critical mass" point, where someone would rather take, or demand, payment of an appreciating currency than a fiat currency that will get them less food tomorrow than today. 
I'm no macro-economists but makes sense to me.

Are you using google Trends for this info?

During the last spike, like in the past 2-3 weeks, a bunch of first-timers, like myself, jumped on the crypto-train. Coinbase is the most user-friendly way to enter the crypto market for the US market. Hence most new investors tend towards using it for their first purchase.
Nothing is really wrong with Coinbase. It just takes a while for coinbase to verify and/or show your coin balance in USD value. Mine showed up today and I'm down about -10% (value loss) from when I jumped in.
I believe the poster was inferring that once new (amateur) investors see that they temporarily lost value in their Coinbase wallet, they will panic sell and/or leave the market, thinking they'd be buying a Lamborghini this week with the $1000 they put in last week, and are now disappointed. Thus pushing the market value further down.
But that seams the norm with crypto and presents opportunity to buy undervalued coins for more savvy investors, because they know that in the medium to long run it will rise drastically in value. 
Again, I'm new here as well, but learning as much as my brain can possible soak up.

Great intro and quick summary, however it didn't clarify that the dollar is no longer attached to gold. Gold is now its own independent speculation market. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:27:46
My theory on the USD is that it is backed by debt. There is more debt owed in USD than there is actually USD. And the reason why USD is valuable now, opposed to when it was gold backed, that if I don't take your dollar, I can't pay my mortgage, if the bank doesn't take my dollar, they can't pay the FED, if they can't pay the fed, they go bankrupt. 
Up and down the financial ecosystem there are more dollars owed than owned. And the consequences of not valuing it are severe.

It depends if when the next economic bubble bursts, do crypto hodlers and investors view it as a store of value or a speculation. If the majority view it as a a store of value, then, like gold, more money will actually rush into it. This could be the push it has needed into the mainstream on a global level.
However if it is thought as a speculation asset, the price will crash, however there will always be as much bitcoin "tokens" as people have, where there is more fiat money owed than there actually is in the economy. 
Interestingly, when the stock market and other investment markets crash, the purchasing power of the dollar rises (deflation), at first, as it is viewed more reliable than investments. Then the fed prints more money to encourage the economy to recover and then the dollar goes into a faster inflation. 
We're headed towards interesting times.

You shouldn't have any issues. Just remember that if you sell for more than you bought them for you may need to pay taxes on the profit.

Yeah that's the mentality I tend towards too. Either way I get excited hahaha!

You could also have it be a random lottery. Some lucky fools get .001 BTC if they pop the right one and have ads on it

Good luck!

Show me the gold! Seriously, our economic system is so screwed. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:37:12
This applies until Theirs' Law kicks in. At some point merchants will start to demand BTC/crypto over fiat since they want appreciating currency over depreciating fiat. But we're far from that point. 
Edit: sellers -&gt; merchants

How does the coin receiver know that the coin has officially been sent? Is it immediate with a 10 minute delay to finalize it, or does it take 10 minutes to say whether the buyer even has the coins?
