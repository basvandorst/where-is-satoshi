Its not getting ripped if you want leather heated seats and a sound system that doesn't sound like total crap. Some people like to be comfortable and listen to music in their cars. 
Also in NA Toyota doesn't make a vehicle with a manual transmission larger than the Corolla. They also don't make a sedan with awd. So if you want a larger sedan with a stickshift or awd while also having the reliability of Toyota, you are forced to buy a Lexus. 
If I could buy a stickshift Camry with awd and leather seats I probably wouldn't have bought a Lexus.

Not sure about every 3-4 years but yeah nothing wrong with spending a bit more to buy a fun car. It doesn't have to be a brand new coupe or a damn race car, just find a four door sedan with a v6 or a little turbo hatchback with a manual transmission and you can have a lot of fun. 
Saying a car is the "worst asset to spend money on" is just ignorant. Some people actually enjoy driving.

Yeah if you want a fun car you don't need to spend $50k on a BMW. Plenty of great reliable Japanese sports cars for like 1/5 of that.

Yeah and if you live in a snow area like me then a 17 year old Camry is going to have severe frame rust regardless of the miles. Toyotas are awesome cars, but they do rust quite a bit.

Yeah its weird that some people just assume no one enjoys driving. Sometimes I just take my car or bike out and ride it around by myself, its a fun hobby. Not everyone treats driving like a chore.

Thats insane, I put about 25k miles on my car per year. I'm driving a 2010 with 210k miles.
