Donating bitcoin wallets with a small fund to anybody around me that is interested in bitcoins.  
Let them try.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:24:01
I like to say:  
If you want to buy something anyway - use bitcoins.  
Exchange some money and spend those bought bitcoins on the things you want.  
The outcome is the same. You get what you want and you pay the same price.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:25:43
I have some problems too. The price does not change.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:29:28
Thanks for believing in me...

This makes bitcoin just a "man-in-the-middle" for fiat.  
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:52:14
Taxes will kill your earnings.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:24:49
1,000,000 Bits = 1 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:44:43
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:00:23
Buy everything you need via bitcoin.  
And start exchanging a small amount every day.  
Or find a big buyer, there are a lot of them out there.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:28:48
They are having some server problems.  
Drink a cup of tea and come back after a while.  
Everything will be fine.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:12:59
No, I am asking for a way that a merchant may use bitcoins instead of exchanging them for fiat.  
Right now those bitcoins are kind of a "man-in-the-middle" to get some usd.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:17:02
Nice try, mr.ceo!
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:19:20
  
Verification takes about 30min.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:24:56
If you are going to daytrade I'd recommend using the coinbase/bitstamp wallet.  
You can not sell bitcoins from your blockchain wallet.  
Good luck.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:50:55
This is your chance to be a part of a growing market and attract people that are in search for ways to use that virtual currency.  
It may generate a lot of buyers as there is no large amount of shops accepting them by now.
And this may end in an overall larger customer amount. Profit.  
So tell me. What can you lose?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:16:15
This is it!
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:36:31
Why don't we start a thread that lists big company's and their emails?
That way we could start sending emails and show them how much people want to pay with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:10:25
I'll write a long answer later. I am mid-meeting right now.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:50:52
I am sorry to say that this was your own fault. Invest a couple of minutes and read about bitcoins and with that about how to secure them.  
Why do you put money into something you don't understand?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:29:24
1433,8$  
Don't tell anyone.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:09:17
You don't need to be sorry.  
Have a nice day, sir.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:51:10
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:20:57
Wow.  
Might contact you in the next months.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:14:32
Again. I am not talking about myself but the typical "Uncle Sam" that uses his computer only to jerk off to some blonde barbie dolls.  
How to make it easy for HIM to get bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:07:45
On Android:  
Download Blockchain App.  
Scan Public Code as "Watch Only".  
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:03:39
I am not a merchant so I am not familiar with that type of stuff.  
You should consider searching for "Bitpay".
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:01:18
Taxes are about 30% (depends where you live).  
You will lose a lot of money daytrading without experience. Especially daytrading bitcoins because of the ups and downs. 
The gains you may make will be scaled down due taxes and will hardly surpass your loss.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:14:24
Easy (!!!) step by step guide for buying, selling and using bit coins.  
We need to get people that are not really good at computer stuff to join the bitcoin community. And people that are too lazy to read a lot.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:13:56
Nice try, faker.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:01:00
I don't understand your actions.  
You said you are inspired by the idea and you believe in it. So keep Bitcoins and spend them! Buy the stuff you need with BTC instead with fiat.  
Nobody is forcing you to keep BTC as an investment.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:41:19
Ah, ok.  
That's lovely.  
I was not interested but I asked for all those other lazy bitcoiners.  
I hope you'll get some requests.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:06:59
Keep some money on Bitstamp and buy as soon as you need to.  
Or keep some BTC at Bitstamp and sell as soon as you desire to.  
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:19:45
1. Get a domain and server.  
2. Describe your idea ELI5 Style. (+ Video)  
3. Put QR-Code for donations.  
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:35:22
You can get your coins in no time with Localbitcoins.  
Just buy 0.012 BTC and as soon as you have them distribute them on different paper wallets.  
P.S. Welcome!
Edit:  
Addition:  
I have read this too quickly. Where are you from that there are no localbitcoiners around you?
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:02:41
There are wallet programs that don't need synchronization.  
Like multibit.  
Good luck.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:00:49
I never waited longer than 10 minutes.
How large are your transfers?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:36:04
That's why they all are panic selling.  
Take a deep breath and relax.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:33:04
How can you guarantee that you are not storing the private keys?
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:38:02
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:58:34
If you are trying to daytrade, you will have a lot of fun with the taxes.  
Here you can read about Blockchain vs Coinbase and create your own opinion where you want to hold your coins at.  
No matter what, activate 2FA!  
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:29:16
Hahahaha thanks for making my day!
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:45:26
I know that feel.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:40:00
They nearly stole a million euro.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:16:48
Bei Fragen kannst du dich gerne an mich wenden.  
Viel Spaß mit deinen Bitcoins in Zukunft ;)

A friend of mine bought a Canon EOS 5D Mark III for ~4 BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:28:45
Too lazy to take a picture and still want people to spend money?  
No donations from me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:03:45
Won't drop much lower.
People are hot buying in.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:08:16
I have no time to respond right now but you are so WRONG that it even hurts reading your arguments.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:19:11
People are in panic because the money that was made by the stores on Blackfriday is exchanged to usd.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:39:24
The fees and delays will give you a bad time. So don't try it until you have a way to overcome those.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:23:08
And I get downvoted here?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:47:10
Wow. So coin. Much currency. Amazing!
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:28:35
There are just a couple of companys that can afford building an inhouse solution to that.  
All the others will and are using bitpay.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:19:48
Again.  
I don't talk about me.  
It's all about the typical "Uncle Sam".  
Thanks anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:57:50
It also may be worth 2000$.  
Or just exchange it instantly if you are worried about that.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:48:24
Killing me softly, when I think about the money I could have made while waiting.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:21:17
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:51:17
This is how markets work.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:26:20
For me it was a sure thing.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:27:50
I really don't know how this is done, but I have seen it.  
Source: A friend of mine uses Bitpay to accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:23:51
That's right.  
I am asking if there are any ways that I can reinvest those bitcoins instead of exchanging them. Or use them to pay electricity etc.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:56:32
Why don't you sell once 100$ for 1€?
This will break the economy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:57:00
"Invest" that money as long as the loss of that money won't kill you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:38:33
Don't forget to buy some stuff on Friday.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:54:44
That's why we need to make getting some bitcoins easier.  
Women and old people are not into computers like we are.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:37:26
Most of the people are little afraid chicken. That's why you see a price drop every time you hear something about bitcoins that may be interpreted negative.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:07:15
Hey,  
ich lege dir Bitcoin.de ans Herz.  
Hab bisher immer unter Wert kaufen können und extrem schnell.  
Die Preisunterschiede kann ich dir leider nicht genau erklären.  
  
Edit: Sorry for not answering in english, non-german reddit user.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:24:33
This will not help bitcoins grow.
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:38:20
There was no negative subtext in my message, dear friend. :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:13:25
You can tell if someone made a purchase within 2 seconds.  
Confirmations come later so there is no double spending occuring.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:27:24
Localbitcoins is the fastest way as it does not need any verification.  
I buy my BTC on Bitstamp. Takes some time to get a verification but is way easier to get larger amounts and also sell them off.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:53:05
"[...]He is going to be very pissed[...]"  
I don't get how people can get pissed about losing something they did not know having like some hours ago.  
Hold them or spend them on stores that accept bitcoins. Don't exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:27:49
Donations first of all show you that this idea is welcome.  
And you have some money to work on this project.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:57:52
Sell so I can rebuy cheap!
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:50:47
I am not talking about me receiving any bitcoins.  
It's all about making it easier for people without knowledge to buy and have bitcoins in their wallets.  
Imagine your grandpa buying bitcoins without any problems.  
That's where we need to head.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:18:10
Enter 2x spacebar after the point you want a return.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:31:21
Buy something with BTC you need or want.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:10:56
For a merchant there is no other way than just converting those bitcoins to fiat.  
We need a bitcoin circle where no coins are exchanged.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:34:53
Not hard at all. You just need to understand how wallets work.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:29:57
I don't like that name.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:11:18
Heard about it around 2008-2009.  
Was fascinated about them and wanted to buy a lot. Instead I invested about 100€ in poker.  
Regretting it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:49:11
First of all - bitcoin is not made for "trading purposes". It is a currency.  
Do you support it and do you want to use the currency? Put money in it.  
Are you here only because of the $$$ you may make? Leave this subreddit and visit r/stocks.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:44:16
You are awesome!
This is why bitcoins are going to the mars and beyond. People are just nice.
Can't wait to get some too as soon as I am verified.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:53:40
Never invest money you can not lose.  
Losing $20 won't change your life, but losing all your savings may be a big game changer for you.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:56:39
I can recommend Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:31:49
What do you want to do with your bitcoins?  
Spend them -&gt; Blockchain  
Hold them like a spartan Warrior -&gt; Cold Storage -&gt; Paperwallet  
  
I use BitStamp as my main exchange. No problems, responding very fast. You just need to wait some time until you are verified.  
  
Good luck mate.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:54:20
Leeeerrroyyy Jenkins
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:33:36
So... How do you imagine it the other way round?  
Let's say you want to buy a meal at subway.  
"This makes 7$ worth of coins"?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:25:21
1. Filesharing  
2. Everything +18 (i.e. Condoms in large amounts, toys, w/e)  
3. Apps (iTunes, Google Store)  
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:20:06
Klar,  
würde dir aber lieber ein Paper Wallet empfehlen, da du dann nicht abhängig von einem Anbieter ist. Schließlich weiß man nie was mit Bitcoin.de passieren kann.  
  
Vergiss aufjedenfall nicht die 2FA zu aktivieren.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:51:34
Thank you so much!
I will use it for a good deed.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:18:28
Just take a picture with proof, sweetheart.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:58:34
Want to buy something for 40$?  
Exchange ~40$ to btcs.  
Buy this thing with those new bought btcs.  
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:04:42
Where are you from? How fast do you want to get them? Are you ready to wait for verification?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:03:12
So do you encourage your grandpa to start a company to get some bitcoins?  
I'd recommend to buy them instead.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:02:00
Create a paper wallet if you are interested in holding long term.
You can scan the public key on the blockchain app as "watch only" and check out how much btcs/money is on there.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:12:00
Search for "BitPay"
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:40:00
The world is still not ready for bitcoins yet, so there is no place for something like litecoin.
