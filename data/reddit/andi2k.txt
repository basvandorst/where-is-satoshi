Thats true of course. But i am happy that this asshole was to stupid to get the coins before i transfered it. And perhaps someone else reads this and makes a backup of his wallet. This is not about 150$. It's about if you can make a backup of your money then you should do it.

Sidechains are only the attempt to build altcoins that look a bit like bitcoin! Altcoins lose its value because they don't offer anything really new compared to bitcoin. People realise that and therefore the people who missed to use and understand bitcoin in the beginnings now try to get their pice of cake with sidechains, after the altcoin thing didn't work out for them.
Sidechains can't do anithing you can't do with bitcoin itself. Don't fall for the microtransaction argument. For example: Sidechains do not reduce the hard drive space needed to store transactions. Miners just have to store several small chains instead of one big blockchain.
Sidechains are no solution that really helps bitcoin. Just raise blocksize if needed, do small transactoins outside the protocol (services are built if there is a market for that).

If i buy something and it is possilble to pay in Bitcoin then i use Bitcoin as payment option. After payment i go to an exchange and buy back the amount of bitcoin.
But i don't see a big problem in hoarding Bitcoin. It is ok if Bitcoin is used mostly as a store of value the next few years - Gold for example is worth something and it mostly is just a store of value because it is heavy and no one wants to cary it arround to buy something.  
By the time more people will use Bitcoin as payment system if they gain advantages of it. I think it is good if people actively push using Bitcoin as form of payment to make adoption faster. But if Bitcoin is good then it is only a matter of time until it is is used by many people. If it sux then it will die - if you push using it or not.

But i hope you made very good security precautions. If your database is hacked and someone steals the money from 100000 Facebook users that would be very bad for trust in Bitcoin!
So please double check this and use offline wallets for bigger amounts of BTC if you haven't done already.

"The blockchain can't be robbed" This is true, but if you register a wallet at " then this wallet can be robbed. The "blockchain" that stores every transaction is not the same as a wallet at " They just use the name "blockchain" ... just wanted to make clear that there is a difference.

In my opinion you should not change your money into bitcoins. Wait a few years and if Bitcoin succeeds then change your money into some and use it. But do not speculate with it if you are afraid.

I don't think that there are places in Berlin where you don't get internet access with your phone. Of course you can make Paperwallets. But without Internet connection you can't prove that there is BTC in the wallets. And of course you could take away any money from the paper wallets after handing them out to someone. In my opinion handing out paperwallets only is usefull between people who know and trust each other.
If you have no internet connection is makes no sense to pay people you don't know. If you are in a bar that accepts BTC then the owner will ensure that there is internet access and offer wlan to you if mobile phone network doesn't work.

Honest miners will not participate. This is just theoretical possible. Miners know that Bitcoin will become worthless if they support someone attacking the network.
Conclusion: Honest and selfish miners both don't want to have worthless bitcoins and won't support someone attacking the blockchain.

Bitcoin is Software. If there is an idea that can improve Bitcoin very much then it is no problem to implement the new features into it. You can do it yourselve and change the Bitcoin protocol. If the majority of Bitcoin users likes what you did then there will be a Fork and the new version is adopted. If the majority doesnt like it nothing will change.
That although means if the majority likes another cryptocurrency more than Bitcoin there will soon be someone who implements the features into Bitcoin because Bitcoin users dont want to get Bitcoin get worthless an let run users away. Bitcoin will always be as majority of users wants it to be. And if the majority likes how Bitcoin works there is no possibility for another currency to get more users.
@_date: 2013-04-30 10:58:52
Of course you can hold your Bitcoins as an investment. But why does this prevent you using Bitcoins to buy things online ?
For Example you have 5 BTC and hold them for 10 years because you think they will be worth more then.
If you want to buy a new Computer now you can change your fiat currency into another 2 BTC at an exchange and use them to buy your PC online.
Of course you will only do this if you gain advantage from this. But if buying things online is cheaper using Bitcoins (seller and buyer dont have to pay fees to paypal for example) then i think you will do it.

Don't price them in $! They don't generate $! They generate Bitcoin or some altcoins. For example: If the USB miner costs 1BTC and will mine 2BTC in one year then its profitable and you buy it. If you just look at the dollar price then of course if BTC price goes up the dollar price goes up, too.  If you compare the price in bitcoin for one USB erupter from a few month ago to now, then you can see the USB erupter is cheaper now.

I made a few calculations!
At 1:20 there are 12 PD (People Dancing). It was not easy to find out how much PD there are at the end. But i came to the conlusion that there are around 150 PD.
I no take MTGBBP (Mtgox Bitcoin Bubble Price) in USD (Blowstamps), because mtgox is the highest one! The price at the time you postet the video was: 598.264 $$$. Ok: Now we have all we need for the Bitcoin price prediction! We have 150 PD when the musik stops and divide this through 12 PD at YTVT (YouTubeVideoTime) 1:20 ==&gt; 150PD / 12 PD = 12,5. Now we just have to multiply: 598.264 $$$ * 12,5 = 7478.3 $$$
This is the most precise BCBPF (BitCoinBubblePriceForecast) i can make at this moment. You should sell at about 7300 $$$ to be save.

In my opinion one Bitcoin is worth more than 10000$. But people who want to sell me something have the opinion that one Bitcoin is worth about 800$. This is the reason i cant't spent my Bitcoins at the moment. I have to wait until the market values Bitcoins the same as i do. It is not the point that i don't wont so spend my Bitcoins. But at this low exchange rate it just sucks. Would you give someone your car in exchange for an apple just because of the other guy is to stupid to understand that a car is useful ? I don't think so.

&lt;I bet this is a really dumb question.&gt;   Yes :). Lets assume you have 10 bottles of beer, your father has 5 bottles of beer and your mother has 7 bottles of beer. You now sell 1 bottle of beer to your father in exchange you get 1000 $. Now every bottle of beer is worth 1000$. You have 9 bottles == 9000$, your father has 6 bottles == 6000$ and your mother has still 7 bottles == 7000$.
Your family is now rich. Together you have beer that is worth 22000$. Now your father sells 1 bottle of beer to your mother. He gets 1.5$ in exchange for that bottle. Damn. You are all poor again. the whole money has disappeared

The 175 micro Transactions are the problem. They make useless traffic to the network and they make blockchain bigger. Paying so much fee for that will cause people to make one bigger transaction instead of 175 small ones.
This is bad for you i know, but i dont think you can do anithing about it, except try to make the transaction without fee and take the risk that the transaction will not confirm.

If you calculate it this way then you have to realise that transaction costs getting cheaper over time.  For example: At the beginning of Bitcoin there were very few transactions in one block ( zero to five transactions at most) With your calculations one transactions costs &gt;10BTC if there are just five transactions in one block (reward was 50BTC / block).  With transaction volume has risen over time the costs for each transaction now are just a fraction of the costs 4 years ago. In the future when you assume there will be even more transactions in one block and the block reward gets even less the costs for each transaction will be &lt; 0,1%.  So even with your calculation (which of course is correct) BTC will be a lot cheaper than paypal.  The block reward is what gives Bitcoin the initial sparc to start because at the beginning no miner would put transactions into the blockchain if they only would get the fees which are nearly zero at the beginning. So this is just what block reward is about - Make transactions more expensive at the beginning if you want to calculate it this way.
