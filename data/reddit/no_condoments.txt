They still show the value of bitcoin balances in terms of bitcoin though.

Good point. I guess what's the importance of this being inside DNA then, as opposed to on a tiny disc?

I dont think water cooling a CPU is as easy as throwing a laptop in your pool. ��

Bitcoin doesn't use decimal places. It uses only whole numbers of Satoshis and then displays them as bitcoin. Bitcoins are really just a display trick. The actual atomic unit of currency is the satoshi.

Synthetic DNA is interesting, but what about going the other direction. Take your own DNA and generate a password from it?

I earn 6 bitcoin* every year! All I need to do is work.
*paid in fiat, but value could be measured in bitcoin if you want.

You think they will pay you $7k for being a beta tester? Why would they just give you $6k? I mean, $8k is a lot of money.

The code is written with integers representing whole numbers of Satoshis. Then for display purposes, they are displayed as "bitcoin" which in number of satoshis / 10^8. Changing the display currency is trivial, but changing Satoshis to be fractional would not be straightforward.

Yeah, but 2017 was the first year that more than half of web traffic was finally encrypted. The world is slow to adapt. 
If people are finally implementing encryption in all the places it should be, and trying to give credit to blockchain, I guess that's a win.

How is it possible to "lose your car"? Doesn't that mean that you sold your car to buy bitcoin?

What about cross-chain swaps and smart contracts? There must be some way to launder bitcoin in a way that makes it more private.

The price of bitcoin as expressed in altcoins went through the roof in 2018.
