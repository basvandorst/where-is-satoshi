The more money they print the less the money is worth. 
Plus they wouldn't need to print anything to buy all the Bitcoin as the already have enough and some.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:45:16
The economy naturally adjusts itself.
If there is suddenly a shit ton of ppl printing money to buy bitcoin (unlimited buying a limited) then Bitcoin will skyrocket in print

I think bcash is a scam but something still needs to be done about the backlog on Bitcoin. We were told segwit would fit it. Well it didnt and the scammers at bcash were right.

If someone had 100% of the mining power there are much more profitable attacks they could do.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:11:45
But fees only rise temporarily, while they are being spammed.
The amount of fees you have to pay to spam is more than you will profit off the temporary inflated fee amount.

I researched this on bing and it said you're full of shit.
@_date: 2015-05-27 05:50:06
Couldn't this lead to some type of 51% attack by having such a large blockchain only your miners accept it
@_date: 2017-02-25 09:36:33
I think eventually something more extreme than segwit will be needed. When there are no more miners due to there being no more bitcoins to mine we will need extremely large blocks to hold all the transactions that the limited miners can process. 
Either that or huge fees to encourage mining.  This current attack really gives us a heads up to prepare for the future of Bitcoin. However, the attacks are not the problem. 95% of miners bailing out is the problem, after all of the minable bitcoins are gone. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:04:28

@_date: 2017-03-14 21:42:15
What do you not understand? 
Bot? 
As I see it.
Segwit benefits everyone who uses Bitcoin. Not having segwit benefits miners. Both are important.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:47:54
The effects of spamming to raise the fees are very short lived. This would not pay off unless miners had atleast 50% (or more) of the mining power which would enable them to do much more durastic things like double spend to get bitcoins much more easy. 
There is no benefit for them other than trying to convince others the current methods are weak and BU is better. Which all their attacks prove is the resilience of the current system.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:36:35
You're saying revenue might go up because there would be additional transactions? 
I remember when there weren't full blocks and fees were almost non-existent/only if you wanted to rush your payment through.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:14:10
You've been a redditors for a month. 
You're an alt account gtfo.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:34:36
How would there be 0 transactions?
Currently with limited transaction processing it requires larger fees. Larger fees means more revenue for the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:10:06
I support segwit. 
But everyone is pretending there is absolutely zero reasons people shouldnt. While in fact there is a pretty good one.
This whole segwit vs BU bullshit is dumb. I feel like everyone is yelling we must pick a side when in reality staying here is fine also. 
If lightning networks are right around the corner then good they will take confirmations off the blockchain. 
What else is being pushed with segwit that someone wants so badly? 
 
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:34:41
This is one of the few posts on this subreddit I have ever upvoted. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:19:15
Sorry but I think your logic is fallacious.
You're saying they are making profit by spending their bitcoins on themselves?    
They only profit 20% of the fees, not of the entire transaction amount. They are paying the fee so they are losing 80% of the fee, not profiting 20%     
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:22:10
So from what I gather. BU would create a hard fork from Bitcoin thus becoming an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:24:26
I'm a noob around here.
How is BU malicious?
This all just really seems like a power struggle to me. Everyone wants to be in charge of the ship.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:44:44
Slush said Bitcoin was never intended for micropayments.
User explains it was and cites when early devs said it would allow micropayments, as one of its main attractions
You then say "well those days are over"
What is even your point? The statement was about micropayments ever being part bitcoins purpose and they were. Them no longer being possible because of full blocks does not mean they were never part of its functionality.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:40:57
Im rather curious and uninformed. What makes BU a scam?
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:00:18
I never said I oppose segwit, I actually said the opposite. 
I oppose the way people are pushing it. Making it seem like a do or die, when it isn't. 
Now that BU is around people are saying it's segwit or BU. Us or them. When there is completely another sane option to stay with bitcoins current yet limiting state.    
PS: I did answer your question. You asked if I support blocksize increase and segwit would double the current size. I said I support segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:09:50
The only reason fees are currently as high as they are is because the blocks are full.
If the blocksize was doubled they would no longer be full and fees wouldn't be needed to compete to have your transaction included in a block
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:47:33
The lightning networks are basically going to be bitcoin trading off the blockchain right?
I hold 100 bitcoins and I just keep track of who buys/trades them inside of my market
Can't the owner of the lightning network then just pretend they have 1 million coins and have everyone trade inside their market? Creating their own value and deflating bitcoins value.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:14:37
How would they benefit from segwit?
It is already implemented on various other coins.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:30:24
Wouldn't the fees be much smaller?
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:41:24
I don't support BU at all.
However, I do feel Bitcoins current state is more sustainable than you imply. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:26:14

You're here to push an agenda. I checked your comments and your history. You've either been a productive lurker or have had other accounts based on your comment history and jargon.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:05:54
The fees are still low compared to anymore payment options. They are more than they used to be, but still lower than all commercial payment options.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:33:59
You're implying segwit is receiving money from third parties?
Do you have proof to back up this claim? Or is this the typical banter that we often see BU saying "where is the proof!!" 
Edit: censoring the comment that I replied to really only gives credit to his agenda...

"2-3MB" that's 2 to 3 times the amount of space as before even if everyone didn't use segwit. With segwit it's even more because the transactions data does not add to that amount.
2 to 3 times the number of transactions is a HUGE amount. 
You made it sound very nominal.

This altcoin you speak of probably has very little nodes and is thus centralized.  Or the 8gb blocks are never full. Most nodes on Bitcoin could not maintain an 8gb block size, which would result in less nodes and more centralization. Which completely disproves your post.
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:03:55
Well where have you been the last few weeks? Segwit activated and transaction costs have already cut in half and are still going down. The mempool went from over 35m bytes down to 5m bytes. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:26:07
It's network requirements that would force most current nodes out not hardware.

I bought 10 at $30 each. So while I can give you many reasons it's better in areas, I only need to give you one reason. 
Even at the $300 the coins are at now. I've mined 5 coins with a normal pc making my total coins 15 for $300 investment. On this $300 investment Im currently up $4200. 
If I had invested $300 into Bitcoin at the time I'd be around $700 up.

Excuse me for being out of the bitcoin loop for a while. Last I knew Satoshi was not even known if he was a single person. Has this been dis-proven? A while back i saw an article saying they found Satoshi but it turned out not to be him. Doesn't he have enough bitcoin to distablize the market even if a single bitcoin left his wallet due to speculation?
Couldn't, given bitcoins logging, all the bitcoins he acquired be tracked to a wallet address and all bitcoins from that wallet tracked? Couldn't the same hing be done for that mtgox guy with all the "missing bitcoins"?
Could you or someone else give me a brief update. It would be much appreciated.

Except ethereum has a plan to move to PoS.
Which will use a fraction of the energy. So much less that energy cost will not be a factor in PoS earnings.

Why have a trust and not split the Bitcoin between their individual wallets? Trusts are for things that cannot be split or cannot be sold until a certain point. 
Wright is a scammer. He has done nothing but provide public knowledge information to "prove he is Satoshi". I think a better explanation is that Gavin and them created Satoshi. To keep attention off them. He never really existed. He is them.
