He is serious and that's the joke.

thank you!

I read here a while ago about virus or something that monitors your clipboard and changes the bitcoin addresses to one very similar and steals your bitcoins like that. Hopefully that's not your case, but you should probably check the address of the transaction to make sure it was the right one. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:27:00
did you check all the characters of the wallet and made sure it was exactly the one from bittrex? 
@_date: 2017-01-16 13:32:09
I use purse regularly and work perfectly. I'm not a shopper though, I'm an earner. have around 10 transactions so far and no problems :) 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:58:40
I once waited 6 days for the same reason. eventually the transaction went through.  you could give this a try but I don't think you'll manage.   
too many transactions right now

it would be great to be able to buy bulk codes, instead of having to buy one by one. or maybe have some sort of "cart" where you add all your gift cards at once and pay at the end. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:15:58
I'm getting "Maximum concurrent requests for this endpoint reached. Please try again shortly" when trying to access my wallet. 
something it wrong on their end. hope they fix it soon
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:21:12
Yeah. it's working now. but btc makes me extremely paranoid 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:24:44
thank you! &lt;3 
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:50:47
Yes you can, using bitrefill 
you can even pay with lightning! :) 
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:43:11
Finally decided to give lightning a try, installed a lightning wallet and opened my first channel. works great! I do have one question. 
Let's say I open two 0.5 BTC channels, does this mean I can send 1 BTC via lightning? only 0.5? 
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:42:11
Update: after 1 hour, it says "failed and refunded" and I got my btc back :) 
Hi! quick lightning question. 
I opened a channel, sent a couple of payments, then tried another and now the payment is stuck in "Lightning payment still in progress" , Channel info says "Sleeping, disconnected"
 I opened this channel with ACINQ which seems to be a big node according to  
Any idea what's wrong? will the payment go through? Do I have to close this channel? 
thanks!

Thank you very much!

Only if I could buy more btc with my btc...

It's true. Finding cash becomes more and more difficult every day, the government can't print enough of it because our cash isn't actually made here in Venezuela, like everything else, it has to be imported. The new bills come from Europe and they are obviously expensive, and the government doesn't have enough money to pay those companies to print our money. Our communication infrastructure it's slowly but surely collapsing, so phone calls and internet becomes more and more unstable. So when you need to pay for something at some store you realize A. You can't find cash, and B. Points of sale don't work, so you can't use your credit or debit card. So the last option is asking the owner of the store for their bank account details, and wiring them directly from your phone. Ironically, this is exactly how you'd pay for stuff with bitcoin, but nobody uses it or even knows about it 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:52:38
On the other hand, I still remember when "Hufflepuff" hacked Primedice and made 2000 BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:18:18
The guy in the video is Venezuela's Economy vicepresident, at the [0:41 mark] (  he mentions the government is considering new forms of payment, including "criptomonedas" (crypto coins). 
As a Venezuelan both facing hyper inflation and using btc to stay away from it, this is amazing! 
Sadly, most of our government plans end up failing somehow, but given our current situation (hyper inflation, lack of cash, collapsing banking system ,etc) I think moving to crypto would be absolutely fantastic! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:29:14
I'll try that, thanks.

As a Venezuelan who abandoned fiat a long time ago in favor of bitcoin, a "bitcoinization" sounds pretty cool but it's really really really far away. there's no infrastructure for something like this to happen in the near future, and what is really happening is that people are trying to get rid of their Bolivares any way they can, and bitcoin it's obviously a perfect option but only for the few of us who actually know enough about it to use it.  I've been preaching to everyone I know about bitcoin since 2014 and only very recently I've seen some kind of growing curiosity about it, but not enough for it to become massive. The government hasn't officially banned (yet) bitcoin but I'm sure it's just a matter of time.  But I really do hope that once our economy it's completely destroyed and hyper inflation kicks in with full force, those in charge realize moving on to crypto and not USD is where the real salvation is. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:23:29
Not really. I use localbitcoins to exchange to bolivares as needed for daily expenses 
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:57:26
my fee was automatically set by blockchain, which is something it has done since I have a wallet there about two years ago and never had a problem before. so it's not a simple matter of "being cheap" 
@_date: 2016-05-28 15:09:52
I'm Venezuelan and I basically abandoned fiat about a year ago. Everything I earn gets traded to btc instantly, leaving just enough to get by on a day to day basis. We are far away from having bitcoin fully established down here, but we are getting there. I preach to literally everyone I know about it but most people find it too complicated.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:41:48
Read the announcement. all the info you need is there. 
I've been waiting for a transaction for 4 days and at this point I'm just hoping it eventually gets dropped and returns to my wallet. I love bitcoin, but sometimes  it does very stupid things.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:55:25
He probably have already cut it off and just can't find something to do with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:53:55

Not true. I've been using btc for years as protection from inflation here in Venezuela. I've been educating my family and friends about it. some obviously think is a scam but most believe and are buying on a regular basis and holding, they are nowhere near "rich" at all. at best, they used to be "middle class" before the colapse. each day more and more people want to know abut bitcoin, specially young people. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:53:44
Thanks! didn't know about some of those. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:46:54
Online petitions: literally the most useless thing ever. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:21:48
If you apply the Costanza principle (do the exact opposite of every impulse) you'd be rich by now. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:18:03
Venezuelan here. I basically switched to bitcoin about a year ago, selling just enough for day to day expenses. Several friends and family members have adopted the same system after much convincing. It's fantastic to buy from/sell to them and pay with my phone :D
Sadly, adoption is basically non existent. I really hope more people here realized how much things would improve if we all started using bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:53:51
Thank you! 
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:43:42
Venezuela has never been financially stable. Believe it or not, inflation was even worse back in the 90s. So people here have come to see inflation as something "normal", but which is obviously teaching scary levels. What do people do with cash here? Buy literally anything. Food, clothes, electronic devices, you name it. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:12:37
I'm pretty sure something similar is going to happen here in Venezuela with our one and only exchange, surbitcoin. I haven't had any issue yet, but now I use localbitcoin instead 
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:57:44
Dear Turkey: 
Buy BTC as if your life depends on it, because eventually it will. 
Venezuela. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:00:50
What you are mentioning is arbitrage trading. Buy somewhere low, sell somewhere else high. The thing is, you'd need a way to move your VES (Venezuela Bolivar Soberano) to buy back BTC. As the only practical way of getting VES outside of Venezuela is using BTC, then you'd be stuck with VES which price keeps going lower and lower literally every minute. 
Also, the price shown in the link is not the real BTC price. This is probably some scam trying to get people to send them BTC. Do not use it and definitely don't send them any BTC. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:22:17
Great! I didn't know we had a new exchange here. I'll give it a try.
