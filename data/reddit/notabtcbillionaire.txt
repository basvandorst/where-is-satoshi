It's all good.. I was joking about this exact thing with my editor though

If it comes-off as sour grapes I think you're missing the thrust of the piece.. I urge you to re-read

thanks for the insights bro.. who the fuck knows, eh? who the fuck knows?

Hi.. that's the thrust of my piece I hope.. 
I'm not salty about losing out, I' just want to shake people into action while I am doing it to myself

Indeed, you're talking my language.. I guess found myself with the platform to raise my-own questions and experiences publicly - self-indulgent but I wasn't hearing the conversation locally so I am trying to get people off the fence at-least..
Thanks for the feedback!

This is my point.. I'm just trying to awaken readers of the site who have a similar experience to me to stop stop standing on their dicks and get involved, as I intend to..

hey.. yes, you're right.. please see above, corrected on the original site. 
I wrote this from memory, timelines are a bit squiffy..  thankfully I threw it into the crucible that is pressure makes diamonds etc

I am the person that wrote this.. thanks for the feedback.
If anyone wants to get a point across to me I'm all ears and would welcome a private message.. if you just want internet points keep going for the low-hanging fruit.. hell, I'll even up-vote you myself..

I don't even believe Davos is a real place.. Switzerland, maybe.. but 'Davos'.?!? Just sounds weird.. I'm fully into palladium now anyway, keep your fairydust, or whatever the fuck it is

I'm not news but I write for a website that has decent readership and reckon there are a lot of people out there in a similar boat to me.. I'm not complaining in the slightest, really. Just trying to join the dots..

Thanks, I wrote this from memory.. I've corrected it now.
