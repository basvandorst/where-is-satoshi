Just tried again.  Armory opened, scanned, and notified me it was online(!).  It reported the most current block.  Tried to send btc and kablooey.  Will try uninstall and reinstall.

I got the same call today from my local/regional bank.  No hitches.  This was in regards to both a personal account and a business account.  
On the business account, the only transactions were the initial deposit verification transactions which were reversed and another very small transaction to test the functionality on my web site.  This was probably what set off the fraud alert (which I imagine as a rotating red light accompanied by a submarine dive klaxon.)
I told him I was looking into accepting bitcoin as a payment option for my customers, and to expect more incoming funds from Coinbase in the near future.  To which he replied, "Okay, so these are all authorized transactions?"  Yup.  "Great.  Have a nice day."

UPDATE:  uninstalled/reinstalled.
Restored wallets.
On first send attempt, CRASH.
Restarted. Rescanned. online!
Send Success.
Send Success.
I'm now out of Armory.  
Must say, the wallet recovery from printed backup worked flawlessly.  As soon as they patch this up and get it stable, I'll probably return.  Until then, electrum.

I'm not so sure I want a block chain gathering my pubic data.

Find "Mt. Gox" replace "Goldman Sachs"
Find "bitcoin" replace "US Dollar"
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:08:33
Just checked out the site.
Quick question.  Under legal tender laws, if you advertise a product in US dollars (case of 12, $120.00) aren't you legally required to accept dollars as payment?  If you only accept bitcoin, don't you have to publish your prices in bitcoin?

Am I the only one picking up a slight Nigerian prince vibe here?  Anybody else think we're getting played?

I'm not claiming to be anybody.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm a nobody.  Just a boob with one of those fancy inter web TV screens.

and, thar she blows.  2 blocks in the last 8 minutes.

You also need to figure in the risk premium price of Mt.Gox in the old price charts.  (remember how it was always about $100 more than other exchanges?)  That would temper some of the November '13 bump, and flatten out the post gox dip.  
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:32:33
huh.  
That's kind of a problem, no?
@_date: 2014-02-20 04:35:27
Isn't difficulty adjustment limited to a specific percentage?  And why not royally screw up the block with a 51% attack, execute the double spends, and leave the network in confusion, then also withdraw from mining to make agreeing on the longest block-chain that much harder?
(BTW - clearly out of my depth on this, so I'm not disagreeing, just wrapping my head around it.)

Does this really prove anything?  All the info on the DL and the card appears to be redacted.  (zooming in pixelates what might be a name, just can't tell)  Besides my lily-white skin, what would prevent me from taking a selfie with my DL all blacked out and sharpy-ing up some graph paper to claim I was Arthur Nakamoto?
I want to believe.  Help me believe.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:00:23
I blame Al Gore.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:16:44
Alright, just saw the original DL only photo where you can make out the name.  (the one with the white box redactions on his first post).
It's him.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:09:49
I'm just saying the proof would be the name on the DL, which I can't really make out.  If you want to believe it's him, go right ahead, but a selfie with a hand written statement is not much authentication.  
If it is him, I do feel for him and his family.  They obviously did not seek the attention they are getting now.  (Except for the attention he's seeking by posting to reddit)

Good advice.  I de-app-napped both btc-qt and armory shortly after I installed.  btc-qt is running fine, but armory still very problematic.

dogecoins are real, but they are not bitcoin.  They are both crypto currencies, but dogecoin is a...well,  it sort of capitalizes on techno-ironicism.  Kind of like Jimmy Fallon singing "Reading Rainbow" as Jim Morrison.

What if the purpose was not to make money, but to destroy confidence in Bitcoin?  It seems we congratulate ourselves by citing the $9BN market cap, but there are some mighty rich investors that made themselves mighty rich manipulating fiat.  It might be worth it to them to just to take out bitcoin rather than trying to profit from it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:44:29
Mostly the POS situation you described.  Also, it would make me somewhat uncomfortable sitting across from a face-to-face cash for bitcoin transaction and hit that lag.  I'm not so good at smalltalk.
@_date: 2014-02-20 04:36:29
Thanks.

Coinbase issues an ACH transaction to your bank account for each buy/sell.  This sets off all kinds of red flags at the bank.  
Exm.  You start with 1000 in the bank.  You buy 1 btc @ 500 for clarity.  Your bank sees an ACH withdrawal for 500.  You now have 500 in the bank.
Then the price spikes to 600.  You sell your bitcoin for a cool $100 profit.  Your bank sees a ACH deposit for 600.  
Now remember, even ACH deposits require time to verify.  (Just like a check, where some banks make you wait a business day to have access to those funds.)
There is a price plummet, and bitcoin falls to 450.  You decide to buy.  When you go to pay, the ACH transaction withdraws 450.  You now have only 50 in your account.  Later the price spikes to 550, you sell, and another ACH deposit is sent.  
To you, you think you should have 1200 (600 +550 + 50 left in your account).  But really you only have $50 because the deposits haven't cleared.  You can't buy any more until the deposits clear.
Even if you keep your bank account well funded to cover all your buys, multiple ACH deposits in a single day, paired with multiple withdrawals looks like an attempt at fraud by your bank.  You risk having the entire account frozen while they investigate. 
Everyone here is correct - to day trade you need to fund an exchange account at dedicated trading platform like btc-e or bitstamp.  (and soon Zeroblock? RtBtc?)
