I hate to admit this but if it will help someone, it's worth it. I lost over $250,000 when the tech bubble burst. 98% of my life savings. 98%. I made bad decisions and rode it all the way down thinking this just can't be happening. Sound familiar? 
I thought it was over for me. The next twelve years were the worst of my life. Severe depression and yes, thoughts of suicide. But I didn't do anything crazy, I just kept plugging away and slowly built it back up. And now I'm back and right back in the game. A little wiser I hope, time will tell.
The point is, it's never over.

First read everything you can find on Bitcoin. Know what you are getting into before you risk your money. Bitcoin search on Google, then go to the news section would be a good place to start and will lead you to other information. 
Bitcoin is highly speculative and risky. DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. Others have ignored that and lost their life savings. Please take it seriously.

That's entirely possible. Since we're getting no information, I wouldn't argue with much of anything right now. I would suggest that the quicker they act, the farther it will go toward restoring faith in bitcoin in general. At least for the general public anyway.

In certain class action suits, and this looks like it's one, all customers in that jurisdiction of the court will be included automatically. This suit will include all US customers, not all Gox customers. If you are a customer in the US, likely won't have to do anything but wait for a check if there is one, which I doubt, but who knows.
I get letters all the time informing me of class action lawsuits. I've gotten a few small checks from stuff like this. You have to ask to be excluded if you want to pursue your own resolution. Otherwise, just wait and hope.

I doubt anyone is getting anything back from Gox. Bankruptcy seems likely and by the time that is settled, there will be nothing left for investors.

I'm having a hard time having any sympathy for this guy. Maybe what some on here are saying is true...up to a point. Once he realized that he had a major problem, the right thing to do was fess up, ask for help, AND STOP TAKING PEOPLES MONEY. Instead he kept taking peoples money and stopped withdrawals. He was trying to cover his own ass, not his customers.
I won't use the word evil. I save that for murderers, rapists, and child molesters. But taking peoples money when he knew he could never pay it back demonstrates a callous disregard for anyone but himself. He may not be evil, but he is definitely a criminal.

It doesn't matter what you plan to use it for. Until they have EVIDENCE that you plan to do something illegal with it, they have no right to withhold it. There are laws (US) against illegal search and seizure. The founding fathers thought this was so important, they put it in the constitution (or bill of rights, whatever, don't feel like looking it up.) Withholding your money because you "might" do something illegal with it is an illegal seizure.
It's the same concept as police breaking your door down just because you "might" be doing something illegal in there. That's an illegal search. Supreme Court cases have been fought and won over these basic principles. These are important basic rights that prevent people from being abused and oppressed by their government.

Yeah, I went with coinbase just because they were the easiest one to get cash to. They simply transfer it out of my account when I buy. Then I transferred some of my coins to Bitstamp. Except for the delay in getting your coins till the money clears (bout 5 days), it's a very simple process.

Yeah, I read that part and it's a good point. "some staff" might be misunderstood to mean mid-level management just making a dumb decision. I would think something like this had to be approved at the highest levels and thinking they could get away with it sounds pretty arrogant to me. 
What seems to happen in things like this is the first one to introduce it takes all the backlash and backs off. But others will try something similar that is toned down a bit and that gets accepted, gradually eroding consumers ability to have any say in their own lives. It's a slippery slope that most people don't even realize we are on. We are trained to accept whatever we are told.

When the other networks are saying bitcoin is done, future in doubt, etc.....yes!
edit: For the record, I am not pro-regulation. My point was with all the doomsayers predicting the death of bitcoin, there was at least one guy with a little credibility saying bitcoin would survive.

Market psychology plays a part. People feared Gox was going to fail, so they sold on fear. Once it actually did fail, the bad news was priced into the market and people began buying again. 
There are also many experienced traders who know this is what people will do and trade accordingly.
Oversimplified perhaps but it is a factor.

It's a short article but here are the best parts for any who don't want to read the whole thing. A real lesson in propaganda.
"due to weaknesses in the system."
"chief executive of a Singapore-based trading website, First Meta, committed suicide for reasons not yet known."
"great risks associated with the so-called virtual currency and even the very survival of bitcoin is currently under the starkest of challenges."
"the mania around bitcoin looks even worse than the Dutch tulip bubble"
"The tulip speculation, although irrational, at least had a concrete target product with some value. In contrast, bitcoin may end up to be nothing but some digital symbols."
"With no government, organization or person claiming to be responsible for its security, the much-hyped bitcoin is simply a test field for the Greater Fool Theory, in which a participant assumes he or she can sell it later to a "greater fool."
"the trust crisis in bitcoin will continue to deteriorate."
"A self-evident truth is: If the entire bitcoin system is attacked by hackers, just like the case of MtGox, or the so-called "core investors" evaporate with buyers' hard-earned money, there seems to be little buyers can do.
As warned by China's central bank, bitcoin is not money or currency as it was not issued by a monetary authority, so it cannot and should not be used in circulation as a currency.
It is about time for speculators to see through the illusions of bitcoin and refrain from falling into any potential money-making scheme set by others. "

It's only been banned in two countries. The logic goes, people are doing illegal things with it, it will disrupt our economy, people have lost money in it, etc. Therefore it must be evil. Get out the torches and pitchforks!

I got interested in Bitcoin very recently. I opened a Gox account in November because it was the oldest, biggest, etc. Then I started reading about all the shenanigans going on at Gox and never put any money in the account. I chose Bitstamp instead. The warnings were there. People just chose to ignore them.

Not that I want negative press about bitcoin, but from a news outlets point of view, wouldn't it be more interesting to talk about someone who lost hundreds of thousands and their life savings? $700? Really?
eidt: oops, just saw that big blue "next" button where they break the article up into multiple parts so they can show you 5x the ads. Still, $700? Who cares?

At one time, Gox had 90% of the market and we see how well that worked out for them. Kraken might be a small player right now, but the market is changing fast and they are still one of the early guys. Who knows what it will look like 5 yrs from now.

I can't speak for the rest of the world, but in the US when you deposit money into a bank, it's still your money. The bank holds it for you. The bank may use it to lend to others and make a profit, but it's still YOUR money. They must give it back to you on demand, no questions asked.

The company doesn’t have to answer to any authority or regulator, so it can’t be made to tell folks what’s happening with their money.
Wrong, they answer to the legal system for criminal activities.
Joe Rotunda, director of the enforcement division for the Texas State Securities Board and a member of NASAA’s enforcement section “My biggest concern about Bitcoin is that it’s trendy and there’s a lot of buzz about it,”
In that case, Ambercrombie and Fitch should have been outlawed years ago. We must protect the peasants from anything that is trendy and has a lot of buzz. Does that include toy helicopters?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:54:50
Not a negative article. Why downvote it?
The title sounds like it's going to be anti-bitcoin but it's not. The article is less about Gox and more about all the scams, phishing, and bitcoin stealing malware associated with bitcoin. He makes some good points. 
He also says "anyone who thinks that all these setbacks will be the death of Bitcoin is sorely mistaken."
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:22:15
A generalization but most democrats like big government that controls everything. To them, bitcoin represents anarchy.

For me, it's an investment. I care if it succeeds as a currency only to the extent that it helps drive the price up. 
In that context, a rapid rise (to the moon!) generates news, buzz, interest. Which increases awareness, understanding, acceptance. Which drives the price up even more resulting in more news, buzz, interest......you get the idea.
TO THE MOON!

There were some tweets from people who knew her that indicated suicide also, but yes, still unconfirmed as far as I know. The other is also unconfirmed but I'm starting to hear a lot of stuff along this line. I hope none of it is true but it won't surprise me. Many people had their entire lives wrapped up in this thing.

I believe the two go hand in hand. Success as a currency encourages investment. The increase in value encourages more widespread adoption as a currency.

"In monetary economics, fiat money is an intrinsically useless product, used as a means of payment.[6] In some micro-founded models of money, fiat money is created internally in a community making feasible trades that would not otherwise be possible, either because producers and consumers may not anonymously write IOUs, or because of physical constraints.[7][8]"
From Wikipedia, I like the part about "intrinsically useless product". Isn't that what the doubters say about Bitcoin?
