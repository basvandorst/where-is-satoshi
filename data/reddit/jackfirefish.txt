From coinbases support page:  **Note: Coinbase account limits are calculated automatically. Coinbase Support is unable to increase account limits at this time.**

"Bitcoin is the future of money!"
"Hey guys, I 'm in! How do I get some?"  
Bitcoin people: "FUCK YOU INFANT!"

I can't. As I said my buy limits are $2500 a week. So, it would take almost a month to buy one bitcoin. That would be about 5 months to get 5 btc.

There was an error with coinmarketcap's data - anything that had a tether pair was accidentally listed as 1000% inflated briefly until they fixed the error. Not on the exchanges, but only on coinmarketcap's website.
A CoinMarketCap "data issue" caused significant artificial inflation of several coins listed on the platform on Friday, with some prices inflated by nearly 1000 percent.
While bitcoin's price spiked 12 percent on the crypto data site, other coins saw more increases. The price of aeternity, the eighth most valuable cryptocurrency, increased more than 951 percent, while MOAC increased by 905 percent and bitcoin diamond saw an 876 percent jump on the site. The site's exchange tracker feature was also affected, and falsely indicated that bitcoin was trading above $73,000 on some exchanges.

"Built this?" Is there more to it than just buying it?  [  I assume all we would need is just the code or just piece these bits of code together:  [  and  [

There's no tutorial needed. You just bought something. If you're interested in sharing, just post your python code. That's it.

What? No you wouldn't. Just use a site that swaps tokens without KYC. In fact, Changelly prides itself on not having a maximum amount you can do at a time. Just do some swaps there to Monero, then you're done.

Yup, like I said, CMC is giving bad data.

It doesn't look like it did. One of the exchanges that coinmarket cap is getting the price from must be messed up. Google and coinbase still say BTC is at $6200

The problem with this is your answers are case sensitive. You should have done them all in lower case or something.

Your paragraph is horribly written. Almost impossible to follow. In the spirit of trying to help you out... Run this test and report back.
1. open your bitcoin wallet.
2. copy your wallet address into your clipboard
3. open notepad (or equivalent text editor on your OS)
4. paste from your clipboard
Is it the same address? Is it a different one? There are several malware that will see a BTC wallet address in your clipboard and swap it out for a different address. If you're not paying attention, you end up sending your BTC to the bad actor.
Also, what is your friends address? Is it  [3Eir58aVDBWmFR4LX33nFAEh5uzBwjFaP8]( ?

Why does everyone suggest this? The buying process is not the same on coinbase pro. As far as I can tell, I cannot use my debit card to buy BTC on coinbase pro.
