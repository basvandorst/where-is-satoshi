Wait so this regulation would technically prevent all exchanges dealing with the US from having a cold wallet?
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:32:16
So kraken would fall under that category, no?

God damn that was hilarious. Thank you.

So I have to spend 200 bucks in fees to send 1000? Is this normal?  
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:06:40
then why is this wallet calculating these crazy prices?

Combination of people prepping for the halving and also wall street traders who were curious about Bitcoin are now more easily able to access BTC. Demand&gt;Supply.

Where are you located? Anywhere near vancouver by chance?

That's what I thought. But right now if I want to transfer 100 to a random wallet its costing me way too much. 100 CAD transfer is showing a regular (1+ hour 16.63 CAD) fee on my blockchain wallet. I really don't understand this.

Im currently having troubles withdrawing BTC. It says withdrawals are disabled. I made sure to have my  BTC wallet address inputted in the user settings. Anyone have any info?

Looks like using something like bitpay will likely be the best option. Our system uses 3rd party integration already with a couple processors so I see no reason why we can't implement something like bitpay in our system. Thank you for the response.

Check your email, there should be a confirmation to withdraw. If you have done that then wait for a couple hours.

Thanks for the reply. I will contact you soon.

The operating system that will incorporate maidsafe/storj. Imagine a OS that allows you to access your files and programs anywhere in the world on any device.

Yes, they do. Suppressing gold prices makes inflation less visible.
@_date: 2014-12-07 23:02:00
Thanks for the reply. I will email you soon.

Can someone explain why Bitcoin "addons" or "apps" like this will succeed over competitors from the other coin?  
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:10:22
I really think something like this will be a catalyst for BTC. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:16:24
So cavirtex accounts will be transferred? Meaning I dont have to provide ID to kraken?
@_date: 2016-01-31 08:37:40
Honestly. The way I see it, Bitcoin will not be something people will use to buy a cup of coffee regularly in the future. We will be using some sort of 2 way pegged sidechain tech which uses the Bitcoin blockchain as a settlement network for large amounts. In other words, the average person won't know they are using Bitcoin but behind the scenes the mobile apps will be piggybacking off of the Bitcoin infrastructure. This will enable high volume transactions and customer support functionality which can compete with PayPal/Visa etc.

Pretty sure most mining pools agree.

Can anyone ELI5 SegWit?

To be fair this could just be them stopping trading until they get the Chinese equivalent of a Bitlicence. The twitter post referred to the announcement on 9/04.

So apparently RSA encryption is easy to hack now. I wonder how this will effect the crypto space? LINK:

What just happened to the BTC hashrate???
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:47:44
Sources? Link?

Theoretically, could an entire country vote using the blockchain?

Thank you so much. This is exactly what I was looking for.
