What a shocker, customers like having consumer protections.

Instant liquidation to fiat via a third party makes them "associated"

And? I'm not liable for that
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:52:50
Again, the card holder isn't liable for unauthorized purchases. So how is that a good arugment for not using a credit card?
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:17:04
So a consumer shouldn't use a credit card because of fraud that the consumer has zero liability for? How exactly does it affect the consumers purchase?

It's funny isn't it? Libertarians don't want those statist laws unless they need them of course. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:33:40


Most online merchants I purchase from already save my card details. All they ask for is the security code on the back, and some don't even need that every time.

So is Amazon, Home Depot, Target etc. associated with bitcoin because their gift cards are on Gyft and Gyft accepts bitcoin? Let me know when these companies join the bitcoin foundation.
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:54:46


Yes, they made it even more convenient. It went from pressing 3 buttons during checkout to 1.
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:52:52
They're not accepting bitcoin, they're accepting bitpay/coinbase. They never touch bitcoin and therefore have 0 risk.
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:37:39
How so?
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:58:38
Those fees amount to insurance, something bitcoin middlemen will need to adopt if they really want mass adoption. Not to mention the fees coinbase already takes out.

I guess miners pay for their electricity and wages in bitcoin?

Do you think doge users care?

I needed a new card once, it was sent overnight. Might want to choose a new bank or credit union.


The point was if you are buying something you have to enter a shipping address anyway so keeping your billing information up to date is a moot point, which was one of your original arguments.


Your point was I'd need to enter my credit card information at each new merchant, my point was all I needed to do was login to PayPal **if I wanted to**, bypassing the account creation or entering new payment information. 


That's pretty subjective, my browser autofills my information for me if I choose to. Add to the fact I have the option of chargebacks and zero fraud liability, I'd take the credit card option. If the merchant takes PayPal or Google checkout it's even simpler.
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:13:29
The argument was against using credit cards because of breaches. So you just argued it could happen to coinbase too.
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:49:37
You just strengthened his argument 
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:27:57
Probably the only logical post here and you get downvoted
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:41:40
Does that make Amazon associated because their gift cards are on Gyft and Gyft accepts bitcoin? Just because a partner or processor they use just happens to accept bitcoin as well doesn't necessarily mean that company is now also associated. If these businesses were in the bitcoin foundation then I'd really believe they cared about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:22:05
Seriously? Amazon's 1 click checkout is about as easy and simple as it gets. If your card is saved in your account it's as simple as logging in and picking which card to use with most merchants I've used.
@_date: 2014-04-21 10:49:49
Yeah fuck r/technology and their censorship! Oh wait...
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:19:00


Oh I forgot, you don't have to enter your shipping information to a merchant if you use bitcoin. Lol


I know my cards take years to expire and all that changes is the expiration date, so I have to change 1 line. Again, changing your address is a moot point because you would need to change it anyway if you want your package to show up at the right place, regardless of what payment you use. It's almost as if you forgot about shipping information.


Well if shipping information and billing information don't match that's gonna set off a red flag with the merchant and your bank. And yeah, I do like purchasing stuff with a click of a button, I don't see your point here.


It's a minor inconvenience really. Most merchants take PayPal anyway, bypassing all what you said above.
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:44:38
So you don't deny credit cards have had fraud protection longer then bitcoin has even been around?
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:44:51
76 million households didn't lose any money
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:11:23
So something credit cards have been doing forever?
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:59:16
Or just use a credit card? 
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:46:21
Ask the average consumer if they care about the cost of doing business. If you believe that mass adoption of bitcoin will lead to lower prices then all you need to look at is credit card prices vs cash prices. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:51:33


If you don't think that happens here then lol
