Yes, right now it is pure emotional cycle but this will change when there will be real crypto products with real users. Then you can use the same metric the same company evaluation like investor use now for software companies

Praxis vs practice - cool down, my english is just bad, there is no other intention. 
inflation -&gt; central bank base interest rate -&gt; interest rate on your loan. Banks has to calculate/ predict inflation to keep the business live. Just goole mortgage rate and inflation and you will get plenty of graphs with high correlation between mortgage interest rate and inflation. 
I dont argue about deflation character of bitcoin and thats bad for economy. Thats clear.

My first thought was that bear market will last 2-3 years because we need real products to start next bull run. And it means lot of implementation and testing. 
I was just watching financial news and equity market is in downtrend, sentiment is bad, short term bonds have higher interest than longterm bonds.  It looks like recession is coming. Global recession may prolong crypto bear market to 5-7 years. But it is a good news. We will have time to stuff our bags with shitcoins for next bull run. If you are true hodler....

Number of bitcoin users grows. Number of places which accept bitcoin grows. Bitcoin is deflationary.

Yes but most of the gold is bars or jewelry only minimum is in electronics. Gold value is driven by its history and jewelry not electrotech industry. Gold had value before transistors were invented. 
In computer science there Metcalfes law which says which network is more valuable and therefore bitcoin has the best position. It may change in the future but such altcoin will need significantly better features than bitcoin.

Basically nobody actually uses Bitcoin now.
- how do you know it?
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:13:46
In theory yes. In praxis all banks offers loans with big enough interest. Inflation is already integrated into loan interest. Plus risk.

Who is using gold to actually buy things at the moment? I agree that bitcoin was not well designed for mass adoption. There are other altcoins which will be used for daily payments in the future. Future of bitcoin is digital gold.
