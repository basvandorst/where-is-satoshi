Dude i started with 1000$ and made a full btc out of it when it was like 5k.
You need to invest your Bitcoin! Its like Cash. There is no reason in holding 10k worth of cash in dollar bills laying around. Let the money work for you!

Again a difficulty increase?
I thought that happens only once per month.

i traded for some time but i dont recommend this. before you see some nice gains you lose, and you will lose ALOT.
Go for cloudmining, Hashflare is pretty insane atm. I invested 7k on Blackfridaysale and i reach ROI in 82 Days. Contract lasts 1 Year, so there is some nice time in wich i make pure profit. ofc. payouts will get less, but idc, because its free btc.
Stay away from lending platforms, look and find platforms that pay you in BTC so you still get the gains of the value increase
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:19:44
No, but i read Mein Kampf, does that count too?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:17:53
hmmm i think about it longer than i should....
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:24
imagine how much juicy csgo skins you can buy with that. pull out and go all in csgo cases + keys!
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:17:14
Yea but a real wallet gets synced all the time. And before you make the transaction the actual price is calculated. The problem with a Paper sheet it’s is lifetime. Just check the last months. Btc doubled. And a paper sheet lasts longer than a month. 
A 20$ sheet then is a 40$ sheet now. 
And to print new paper sheets ever day or on an event you want to buy stuff is pretty inconvenient. I really like the idea too.  But it seems  we have to accept using a smartphone or something to buy stuff in the future. 
But I hope that some sort of physical money will still exist then. Just because I really like paper money^^
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:04:36
Naw I think I will just keep them my ledger. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:20:16
I invested in several Platforms and now iam makin roughly 150$ per Day, wich is more than my actual job.
I started Augst this year.
As soon as i hit 600$ per Day i quit my job.

You could use some sort of scanner which checks if the wallet is filled with the amount of bitcoin. 
Like these devices which check if a Money bill is real or fake. 
But then. 
Do you check the BTC value or the dollar value?
Because dollar value fluctuate to much. And in that case it would be useless as a piece of paper because the value of it depends on the time.

@_date: 2017-12-06 08:03:50

@_date: 2017-12-05 10:01:50
What’s has „holding bitcoin“ to do, with your exchange struggle?
Natting my ni��️��️a
