Right, because the absolute best way to make your point that doxing someone is tantamount to Hitlering, is to dox someone else.

Oh, hun, you took a wrong turn at YouTube. The CNN comments section is to your right.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:55:04
So if this man turns out to be the real deal, and the intention wasn't to dox him, you still believe it's not OK to tell his story? 
I actually think the story is terribly written and difficult to believe. But there's no question that the identity of Bitcoin's creator is newsworthy. 
The fact that you can't see that is silly.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:52:19
I won't shed a tear for Mark and what he's done to a lot of people, but the quote below leaves me wondering why, in a story full of journalistic equivocation, and ass-covering, you felt the need to fawn over the other players. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or a cynic, but I have a hard time believing that you don't have a vested interest in the other parties looking good at a time when we must be hyper-aware of vested interests, lazy or incompetent managers, and greedy fuckballs.
"The Bitcoin Foundation, Blockchain.info and SecondMarket have by all accounts acted ethically and professionally in the face of a serious scandal. Their speedy clarifications and apparent cooperation with authorities is commendable and suggests that Mt. Gox was a mere bad apple in an otherwise good bunch."
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:09:24
I'm not convinced his family is "at risk." And if they are, again, that's not on here (assuming it's the real Satoshi). There may have been a better way to write the story (and I don't think it was particularly well-written). But even if, God forbid, something bad happens, fear of that shouldn't keep her from writing the story.

I am not a celebrity. And if it's not the real Satoshi, then I agree she should be fired and sued. But I get the distinct impression that many in this sub don't actually care if it's really him or not. To them, the fact that he wants his anonymity is enough to justify a cone of silence around his story.

I don't know the full history of its founding, but was Bitcoin originally conceived as a commodity? Or has the community simply turned it into one?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:22:17
The Foundation should not now, or ever, represent the community. The Foundation's interests are not the same as the community's. The Foundation's purpose is to push its members' agenda, regardless of whether that's in conflict with what the community wants.
So while TBI's story may be newsworthy and interesting, the rest of us should be working to change any perception that Bitcoin is represented by any one organization. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:47:27
Unlikely. Bitcoin won't jeopardize its multi-billion dollar market cap by implementing protocols that make big financial institutions nervous. Make Bitcoin as anonymous as Darkcoin and you've changed its character such that the big money will move away from it (to whichever coin takes up the mantel of being willing to play ball with regulating bodies).
Put another way, Bitcoin is the family-friendly animated summer blockbuster. Darkcoin is an R-rated action flick. The market has enough room for both, but they will appeal to very different audiences.

Dear Mark,
It's not about you.
The Internet
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:34:46
Yup, because the best way to make the point that doxing is bad, is doxing someone.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:25:48
The alternative already exists. It's known as "the Bitcoin community." There is no reason we should be looking to a central association, foundation, or membership group to guide, lead, or represent us. Asking for that fundamentally misunderstands exactly what Bitcoin is trying to do by building a decentralized financial system.
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:28:47
What service does that?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:20:16
Trade associations and foundations like this one work for no one but their members. They may advocate for issues that matter to the rest of the broader Bitcoin community, but they are under no obligation to help anyone but the people they represent. So, no, their purpose is not to guide the Bitcoin community.

Nice try, Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:46:47
If the price goes from $650 to $550, that's a dip in price, whether it goes back up, stays down, or goes lower. So if you buy at $550, hold until it rises again, and then sell, you'll make a greater profit than if you'd bought at $650. Just another way of saying, "Buy low."

There is nothing the US can do with Karpeles, that they can't more easily do without him.
When Mt. Gox collapses and the evidence becomes as clear as many here can already see, will you finally accept that Karpeles' is a greedy, incompetent prick?

If it turns out not to be the real Satoshi, I will agree with you and be the first to call for her to lose her job. That said, I find it hard to believe that every lawyer at Newsweek didn't have a good, hard look at the evidence and decide it was fit to publish before it went out.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:31:32
Actually, it's possible to judge him on competence alone. There are plenty of companies that have been sued, hacked, broken into, gone insolvent, gone broke, gone into receivership, been ponzi schemes, or otherwise imploded and had restrictions on their communications where not all the information was known. And all of them that I can think of have done a better job of communicating with their customers.
Sorry you still need further information to make a judgment. I don't.

How is Satoshi NOT a public figure? Just because he wants anonymity, doesn't mean he's entitled to it. He's a celebrity, his creation is newsworthy.

@_date: 2014-02-10 16:27:35
Why are you being downvoted? Does this sub have its head buried so deep in the sand it can't see the benefit of a convenient, professional, and SOLVENT place to buy and sell BTC? Ask the poor people who have tens of thousands of BTC tied up at Mt. Gox if they'd pay 1% transaction fees to get it all back.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:35:48
This is not an accurate comparison, though. Mt. Gox wasn't a bank and should never have been treated like one by users.
Mt. Gox, and all the other exchanges, are akin to your local drug dealer. Some are more honest than others, but none should be trusted with your money.
Think of Bitcoins as cash you exchanged something of value to get. When you leave cash with a drug dealer, you don't expect to see it in the morning. When you take it home, now you control its safety.
Take your Bitcoins home and now you're responsible if they get lost, stolen, or hacked.
Leave them at the exchanges, and you're trusting the security legalese you've probably never read.

**TL;DR: Let TwoBitIdiot Speak. He's his own worst enemy.**
TwoBitIdiot seems very immature and narcissistic. A lot of what he has to say seems to be written by a teenager (no insult to teenagers intended).
Having said that, I think your request is inappropriate. Asking him to stop providing nuggets to the media is just the sort of vague "gatekeeping" he thinks is going on. It's like telling the tinfoil hat crowd to stop visiting Area 51 because it clogs up the road outside the base. To them, it's "proof" that powerful interests are trying to control them. We all know it's not true but it just adds kindling to his fire.
Bitcoin can survive negative publicity, or any of the over-dramatized rubbish TBI puts out.
TBI is his own worst enemy. He has such a parochial perspective, he doesn't understand the concept of associations and foundations (which are pretty standard in most industries). They do not speak for the industries their members come from, they simply speak for their members.
An example: the MPAA in the US represents the major film studios (Disney, Universal, Sony, etc). And when it speaks or advocates, it tends to get a lot of attention. But the MPAA doesn't speak for the entire entertainment industry. And if someone had evidence of wrongdoing there, it would mean very little to the broader entertainment community.
If there's something illegal going on at the Foundation, it's certainly newsworthy, and should come to light. But the Foundation doesn't represent Bitcoin, nor should it. The fact that TBI continues to advocate for a "stronger" Board fundamentally misunderstands the concept of a decentralized digital currency, and ignores the role of most foundations (which I wouldn't expect teenagers to understand, they just don't have enough exposure to the business world to get it).
You want to get rid of TwoBitIdiot? Give him a wide berth and encourage him to speak his mind as loudly and as often as he likes. Let TwoBitIdiot destroy his own credibility, which is exactly what he does every time he opens his mouth.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:12:50
You're. . .you're joking, right? Two Bit should be held to the same standards as any investigative journalist. That means challenging him when he seems to be holding water for players within the community.
Take a look at this paragraph from "The Final Goxing:"
"The Bitcoin Foundation, Blockchain.info and SecondMarket have by all accounts acted ethically and professionally in the face of a serious scandal. Their speedy clarifications and apparent cooperation with authorities is commendable and suggests that Mt. Gox was a mere bad apple in an otherwise good bunch."
Sorry, that's not journalism, that's toadying.
As soon as we start telling each other that this or that exchange, service, journalist, blogger, or redditor is unimpeachable, then we've set ourselves up for another Mt. Gox.
Bitcoin will survive this just fine. I feel terrible for those who have lost money at Mt. Gox. But their loss should make us MORE suspicious of every player, not less.
I agree that ad hominem attacks and threats have no place here. Let's grow up. 
But an apology for challenging him? Not from me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:33:04

@_date: 2014-03-07 20:23:14
The breathless, self-aggrandizing narcissism is particularly thick in 2bit's latest. But the best part is this: the Bitcoin Foundation's conduct is SO egregious, 2bit will totes forget about everything if Vessenes and Matonis resign.
Um, if the behavior is so bad, and the foundation is so broken, shouldn't that information be revealed regardless?
Oh, right, but then 2bit couldn't wear his muckraking, truth-seeker cosplay and show how his threats have the power to make the Bitcoin elites quake in their Gucci loafers.
Ugh. And he calls Leah McGrath a media whore. . .
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:49:28

Why you have no upvotes? Why you have no gold?
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:22:06
Agreed. It feels like he's using whatever goodwill he's established within the community to say, "hey, dudes, it's all good, everyone else isn't evil, I've confirmed it through back channels."
If he really wants to help Bitcoin move on and get stronger, he'll just report what he knows, act like the journalist he wants to be, and quit injecting his personal observations.
Bitcoin will survive this, handily. But not all exchanges and services should, necessarily.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:16:11
Again, just because he got some facts right, doesn't mean we shouldn't be suspicious of him when he's injecting his own opinions into his reporting.
Look, if he would simply admit that he's not trying to be an investigative journalist and is just some guy on the Internet with biases he presents clearly, then I wouldn't have an issue with him.
But his breathless reporting, like he's the community's white knight, here to shine a light of truth in the darkness, yeah, no, you have to work a little harder for my trust.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:46:23
Exactly, this is a throwaway sentence, and yet it seems to me to be the most important. How, exactly, was the document's veracity established?

So you think expanding the number of users, adding value to your holdings, and increasing utility could all happen without vocal proponents? Let's pretend your fantasy world is real. You think that Bitcoin could quietly build all that utility and the government would NOT find out and want a piece?

Thanks for the reply. You mention the currency fluctuations, and I think I understand that piece of it (just the change in value of the bitcoin from the time it's purchased until it's sold, right?). But fiat on both ends, do you mind explaining that? Is that just the transactions costs of buying and selling the bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-03-08 12:37:05
I don't think people are as stupid as you suggest. I think the biggest issue for a lot of people is volatility. If you buy Bitcoin but only have a fraction of that at the end of the year (or the value whipsaws during that time) I think it's okay for people to not want to risk their money until Bitcoin appears more stable. 
The technicalities don't matter for most any more than they do for your Internet example. But the Internet, for the most part, just works. The value of it can be realised simply. Bitcoin is still not there for most of the mainstream. 
And calling them stupid, even in the search for a way to explain it to them in hopes of letting them realise the potential, doesn't help. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:47:35
I dunno, saying just the basic concepts require above average intelligence isn't exactly a compliment. 
I think it's easy to say people don't get it (that argument always smacks of desperation to me, in any discussion, not just bitcoin). It's harder to look at root causes and that a speculator culture has grown up around Bitcoin such that a stable trading currency is far from the top of the goal list for many adopters, the so-called above average thinkers.
