thanks Rich I'll check out your merchant material. Definitely want to put together a merchant info pack.  I am attempting to get a meetup started. Currently trying to track down some interested folks.  I will send an invite when we do. It would be great to have your expertise and ideas at the table.  Good luck with things on your end.  Keep up the good work.

Thanks, I just realized after posting this that it was my cake day.  I was wondering when it was.  This is my first.  I'll check out blockchain's mobile wallet especially now since Andreas is working with them.  He should help shore up the security and move things in a positive direction.  I use Mycelium and think that is a good candidate. Especially with the sweep from paper wallet feature.

@_date: 2014-02-17 23:12:13
Interesting. I tried it out too. Like you I created an account at Gox verified the account and got personally verified but never used it.  I did this around Nov after the big 1000+$ rise.  I canceled the account last week after Gox made their first announcement blaming bitcoin for their problems.  I found my original email  account verification and clicked the confirm link.  I was sent to an account confirmation page and the system had given me a long string of numbers and letters as a username and also prefilled in the confirmation code with another string.  There was a message that I had successfully  created my account and an email was sent to verify the account before I can continue.  So now there is an email floating around Gox headquarters that doesn't have an recipient address attached to it.  This will probably take Gox another 2 weeks to sort out this mystery. Sorry if this screws up Gox.  I think I'll delete that link now.

thanks! great reply.  I had recently heard about airbnb but couldn't remember what it was called...so thanks for those.  Yeah the AT comes right down the main street in town. Damascus Virginia.  So there are 2 outfitters and I'm stopping by there tomorrow to start spreading the info. We also have the very popular Virginia Creeper Trail which brings a lot of the city dwellers to town to rent bikes to ride on the bike trail.  So lots of possibilities.  I really like the idea of putting it together and making it a bitcoin destination.  That is big inspiration.  How could blockchain.info help?  I am familiar with it but have not used the wallet.

I am a screen printer and a bitcoin enthusiast so naturally I had to make some shirts for today.  The pictures are of actual printed shirts and are not mock ups.  You can purchase these at zoomco.biz  I am using CoinBase to process bitcoin transactions and accept paypal also.  The shirts are priced at $18 with free shipping in US and available up to size 5XL. 2xl and up cost $2 extra. I can ship internationally at a discounted rate, just contact me.  I can also print wholesale orders at a reduced price for orders of 12 and up.  Contact me for more info.  My website is new and mostly untested so let me know if something is not working the way it should or any issues you have.  I have a couple of more Bitcoin shirts in the works so check back soon.
I can also accept litecoin for payment. Contact me for details.
Thanks for checking these out, I hope you like my work.

Just a heads up on the current changes over at BTCJam.  I have been borrowing and investing for a couple of months there.  Last week they implemented a humongous increase in their interest rates mainly on the short term loans.  They did this with no prior notice of any kind.  My fist loan there an month ago was 30 day term and cost 55% apr.  I paid if off a couple of weeks early and my credit rating increased from a c- to a c+.  When I took out my second loan, same term, .75 btc more principal  the apr had jumped to 380%.  Many people found themselves in a similar position and like myself assummed it must be a bug. Support was spotty if you could get help at all.  It took 4 days for my support ticket and tweets and reddit post to be addressed.  This huge increase happened across the board and long term regular loan customers with A ratings were affected as well.  One user had his regular 7 day loan jump from .85% yield to 16.45%.   The result is good loan seeking customers are pulling out going to other platforms offering more competitive interest rates.  I am leaving BTCJam also and predict that there will be an increased percentage of scammers because they don;t care what the interest rate is sine they won't be paying the loan back anyways.  So invest there with caution and be particular who you invest in.  This may not make the new auto invest option the best technique although it is much easier than manually reviewing each potential investment.  BTCJam doesn't have a user forum so us users had to use a loan comment thread or two to try to make sense of the recent changes implemented without warning.  If you would like more information you view these threads [here]( and [here](  Also in light of the recent interest rate changes I would recommend investing in the longer term loans at this point, as more of the legit users will be opting for these terms since they are a bit more reasonable.
I just noticed that BTCJam is no longer the listing the APR of the loans but have replaced it with a yield percentage.  This change was made within the last 2 days. The APR of the 2 loans linked above were listed at 857% .   Good luck investing over there and be careful.
edit: I was mixing up yield and apr here and have corrected it: form .85 APR to over 800% -&gt; .85% yield to 16.45%.

I'm afraid to click on your reply
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:10:29
My understanding is you can choose to convert your btc deposit to dollars or keep it in btc. If you choose dollars and the price of btc goes up to 480 you still only have $240 which could be converted back into btc for a purchase or transfer and would be .5 btc at that time.  We will see though when they release more details.

It's interesting that they state only a trust company in NY can operate a virtual currency exchange and not a holder of a bit license. I thought that was the major point of the bit license.

Well, how did it go?
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:35:28
Yeah, it all seems a bit odd. Everybody else needs 50 different state licenses but not these guys. And now they are saying the NY bit license won't even allow to operate an exchange. If that is the case why has everybody been waiting for two years for the bitlicense when they could have gotten a fancy Lawskey certificate and been making money all this time.

It might just be a server issue.  Today the same thing happened to me. When I sold the spinner spun for about 20 seconds then I got an error message saying "transaction failed for unknown reason".  I received an email saying the sale was initiated.  A few minutes later the btc showed back up in my Coinbase balance and the sale tranasaction removed from the acct history.  It took three more tries before the sale was successful and a green checkmark instead of error message.  Each attempt, I recieved an email stating the sale was initiated but it looks like there was an error of some sort the first three attempts.  Luckily I noticed the spinning wheel and error message and was skeptical that the email comfirmation was correct.

Yes, I accept bitcoin and own/operate a custom screen printing shop. I recently removed my webstore that facilitated zazzle type self service because of low use and am remaking my website with more general information, you can see the start of it here zoomco.io , it is under construction. I still offer the service of one of a kind "design your own tees" and they are $25 including shipping in the US.  These are full color front on any color 100% cotton t-shirts. You can mock up a design and submit it here for more information if you would like 
I also offer larger bulk custom orders for your group or club payable with btc. I am open and encourage the use of an escrow service like Bitrated for larger orders paid with btc.  Please contact me if you would like further information. I am located in NE TN US.

Just watched your talk on Brave New Coin, well done. Can you suggest how best to handle this situation? Say a restaurant is using your wallet to accept bitcoin payments.  The waiter presents a check to a diner who wants to pay in btc. The waiter pulls out their tablet opens your wallet and creates a barcode for the amount due. Bill is paid, all is good.  How can a receipt of the transaction be made so the diner has proof of payment which can be used to deduct or reimbursement for a business luncheon?  The diners wallet would only have a btc address and perhaps a user memo stating business lunch but nothing proving it was a purchase from the actual restaurant.  Is there a way to do this yet, or is this a use case that will have to be built on top of your wallet?  Thanks, this is something I am trying to solve for a local business.

This is a group for enthusiasts and anyone who wants more information on what are cryptocurrencies and how do you get started. Merchants, consumers, newbies, experts and everyone in between are welcome to join us and help form a vibrant community. Community education as well a camaraderie will be focuses of the meetup. For starters I am using Damascus Virginia as home base because of access to SW VA and NE TN residents. There are also a couple of businesses in Damascus that accept bitcoin as payment which will allow our group to do fun things with bitcoin like ride the Virginia Creeper Trail and sample locally made craft beer. You can help get this group started by sharing your suggestions and ideas and letting anybody interested in bitcoin or other related technologies know about us. The first meetup is on May 7 in Damascus, location TBA. I hope to see you there.

I have been dealing a lot lately with educating new users and merchants and trying to get them to use/accept bitcoin.  I think a great tool for this would be a "wrapper" where I can send a brand new user without a wallet a portion of a bitcoin in a "wrapper" so they can buy a beer or coffee or something without going through the hassle of setting anything up.  I guess it would essentially be a virtual gift card at this point.  The "wrapper" functions like a simple wallet. The new user pays the vendor, any change is sent back to the "wrapper" and can be spent again.   Something like this would help my mission a lot. Don't know how feasible it is, but a man can dream can't he?

tried to check your site out but couldn't get it to load. It was stuck on the loading scroller.  My internet is kind of slow tonight though.
The approach I am taking is to convince merchants in a small tourist town to accept bitcoin so we can market the town as a Bitcoin destination.  The idea is to get a full range of services in a condensed area (all within walking distance) to accept bitcoin so bitcoin enthusiasts can come visit and spend he entire weekend in bitcoin.  When I look at most cities I see random scattered businesses mostly.  So this is a more coordinated approach.  I also have lived and worked in the town for 10 years so I know a lot of the folks I am talking to.  That is helping me a lot getting started, although it is still a tough sell.  I haven;t used any kind information flyer yet but probably will someday. I tempt them with Airbitz wallet directory and encourage them to have their business added to the directory. I will email links if they want more info but don;t think that works very well.   I am also just starting up a meetup in the area. Partially for my benefit to meet others with similar interest but also to help educate the community, merchants, etc.  I think it will reflect more credibility on me when I approach a vendor and then say, we have regular community meetings for merchants and others interested in learning how it all works, stop by sometime and I'll help you get it all sorted out.  At least that is the plan.  So that is my approach and as soon as I get a lodging provider and restaurant set up I can claim it as a bitcoin destination and start marketing it.  I plan on starting the marketing with the surrounding bitcoin clubs by inviting them to bring their family and friends on a "field trip" to Damascus for a fantastic bitcoin weekend and outdoor adventure.  I am also planning on having some bitcoin meetups on the weekend so any interested visitors can join in.
If you run across any useful literature please let me know, and also keep me informed with how your website is progressing. I can use all the help I can get.

this is a good review especially the second half. It answers many of the questions I had about the security behind their login/password/pin model. The more I learn about Airbitz the more comfortable I am getting using it as my hot wallet and recommending it to other consumers and low volume merchants.
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:07:20
good presentation and food for thought.  I was surprised to learn that "overuse" of bitcoin core is a cause of weakness in the network.  Sounds like some interesting additions to the Airbitz wallet coming soon.

Ok thanks for helping sort this out. I have one question though.  I understand factoids are on the factom chain and most of the encrypted data from its users also.  But isn't a "summery" of the encrypted data from the factom chain again encrypted and then embedded in the bitcoin blockchain using some extra data layer?

You could listen to [this](    and talk about how the antiquated ACH banking system in the United States could be modernized by using bitcoin and at the same time become decentralized, more robust, way quicker and democratic and not dependent on some secret severs hidden somewhere in order to make it work.
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:46:53
I have an account here and have completed a couple of transactions to get a feel for it all works.  It's pretty cool and seems real secure.  You set up an HD wallet and use the 12 word seed to make transfers.  It also utilizes Factom, I believe, although I am not sure exactly in what context.  I made a decent return on my first trade.  Bitcoin -&gt; a few silver coins then back to bitcoin.  The market there seems kind of thin so I was concerned I would have a difficult time getting out of silver and back into bitcoin but the trade happened much quicker than I anticipated.  Maybe I got lucky. I would recommend checking them out.  Secure and well put together.  Once a lot more people start trading there I imagine the experience will get even better.
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:32:40

Hi, it looks like you are too far away for a weekday meetup but I am also planning to do weekend ones that are way more practical for you.  Damascus is a tourist town definitely worth a weekend visit.  I am trying to onboard a full range of merchant services (lodging, restaurants, bike rental/shuttles, etc) to accept bitcoin so you can visit for the weekend and spend only/mostly bitcoin.....and catch a meetup so we can chat bitcoin.  So far [The Bike Station]( and The Damascus Brewery are accepting, they just started.  I am working on some others.  So if you do plan a visit this spring or summer, let me know when you are coming so we can arrange a meetup and chat bitcoin.  I am happy to help with any other info you might need to plan a visit. It would be fun for the whole family, except perhaps the meetup part. :)

@_date: 2015-04-14 20:14:35
I would recommend bitpay as well.  If you have a website, there is a good chance there is an easy to install plugin to allow for the integration, or use their mobile app POS.  Then perhaps offer your customers a small discount (based on the fees you are saving not using Paypal), to pay with BTC. This will give them the incentive to educate themselves on how to use BTC
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:55:26
thanks, I haven't heard of this one before. It's cute how they list Bitcoin payment fees at 0% and then note that " this is not a typo", and it's listed right under debit/credit cards at 2.49% + $.30
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:10:41
Right, this is a great point and I did mention this in an email to them.  The services just offer the convenience of automating the conversion and removing the risk of price volatility vs dollars. Maybe adds some security to novice bitcoiners and I think bitpay can add some sort of refund automation if needed. I might need clarification on that last point.  I am prepared to help them setup and manage their own wallet and conversions to dollars if needed.
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:52:01

I see. I did have that exact thing going on a while ago but interest was too low to make it worth while. It's possible I could arrange something for you on the new site if you wanted to try it out. Other than that I'm not aware of any service accepting btc or paying out in btc.

yeah that could be a time saver although a receipt would be beneficial is some instances like a business lunch.  I guess using tablet apps there is no way to print a receipt unless it is linked to a POS? That might actually be a minus.

I recently started with BTCJam and just got my first loan funded.  I have been investing too.  It is really cool seeing the process in action and I really like the community for the most part.  Unless things turn ugly there, I can see myself being an active member of the community for a long time.

Just certified my first file.  That is so cool!

well, that remains to be seen

While we work towards that goal, it would be great to get your feedback on our progress so far. What features/ideas do you have that we should be considering?"

I think the answer is to convince stripe to payout in bitcoins or partially so. But that might take some time.

I don't know about Electrum, but Bitcoin core has to be synced at least to the time of the transaction for your coins to show in the wallet.  They are still there.
@_date: 2015-03-20 23:41:14
they are monetizing the business end.  There is already a paid outlook plugin and more paid features on the way.

and I truly enjoy supporting companies that accept bitcoin. Paying with bitcoin is more fun too.

I think it's because we haven't slept in awhile.

BitQuick is definitely worth checking into. Also check out circle.com. You can buy with a cc without adding a bank account, unless this has changed since beta.  I trade with circle via checking account and it is instant for fiat to btc. I recommend it.

Ok, that makes sense.  Thanks for straightening that out for me. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:36:24
Thanks, I think I get it now.

send me your address and I'll send you a bucks worth, to get you started.

That is great to know.  I am in the 60 day trial period right now and am planning on subscribing when it is over. Didn't know they accept BTC, I like them better already.  My experience with them so far has been great and it is faster than gmail ever was.

should be in your wallet, enjoy
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:05:00
I thought the same thing while trying to claim the $5 earlier today.  I imagine the code going viral broke circle or they panicked and turned it off.  At the very least everybody should have a 2nd funded wallet in case there is "scheduled maintenance"  in the middle of the day while you are trying to pay for your dinner. It was a good lesson.
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:55:32
I'm confused.  Isn't counterparty an open source "coin" that can be implemented and used by anyone. Why can't Overstock use it to create their security exchange as well as Symbiont?  Why is it one or the other?
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:29:17
I have had little success convincing friends and aqauintances to try bitcoin. Maybe putting a secure paper wallet in their hands might do the trick.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:52:20
$5000 to apply...sounds more like a bribe.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:55:30
My first bitcoin was mined on Slush's pool.  You always remember your first.
