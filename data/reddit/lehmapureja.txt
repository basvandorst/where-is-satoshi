Can confirm. They "lost" my funds also. I do not recommend giving them any money.

thank you for updating the chart. 
I prefer to use %-wise comparisons it is more accurate that way. in this case the price did a ~46% correction while the last 7 corrections (all within this bubble, sept 2015 till now) before the current drop have been in the range of 30% - 40% and from that the 3 deeper corrections of ~40% have taken at least double the time or more to complete. So the element of time could also be analysed. I would still say this correction is unprecedented during this 2-year bubble. 
Just as a note - I am not claiming the rise of bitcoin is over or not over.

lol the price totally crashed through your last box you just dont show it. the crash is bigger than the crashes witnessed in this 2-year bubble but there are thou incidents for example in the last bubble late 2013 where the price had a 50+% correction during the bubble.

I have bought quite a bit of items from them in the last 6months with bitcoins. Super friendly customer service!

There will be a hundred eyeballs looking at that post and it´s replies who have not yet made up their mind on the subject. You are not trying to bring the OP out of ignorance you are trying to enlighten the uneducated that are passively observing. Thus it is a wonderful way to spend you energy :)

Thinking even more ahead - when the BCH halving comes sooner like maybe even as often as every 1-1,5 years then the block reward will soon be so small that it will not pay for the security of the network since because of 8MB blocks there might not have developed a proper fee market to pay for security. This does look gloomy IMO.
(This is obviously theoretical though at this point.)

Thanks for that. I see you points. I think I mostly agree on them at least in the long term of things. 
Let me ask you this though - 
Do you agree that developers do have some or even quite a bit of power right now 
*(either directly using their social status or by convincing users of the merits of their ideas)*?
I ask because I would argue that this **road that Bitcoin currently seems to have taken** - scaling starting with SegWit, instead of big block (setting a precedent at the moment at least) - is directly **due to the influence of Developers**. Now is this a good path to take or not - not the purpose of this discussion. Time will tell. But nevertheless I think if the developers had stayed quiet then there is a good probability that the Miners would have had their will enforced (bigger blocks). So **for now IMO the Developers do seems to be a group** (that may or may not stay as a group in the long term) that **brings more balance** to the system until at least the users, merchants and exchanges wake up more to their existence and to the strengths and limits that come with it. 
*-edit: sorry I reread you comment. you seem to agree that they have influence (or undue influence)*
*Also the developers right now do have some hidden secondary incentives - social status, scarce expertise of the new technology, feeling of changing the world for the better, feeling of being the guardians of bitcoin etc (these things can be ephemeral though in the big scheme of things yes)*.
I see the **consensus groups** more **as a changing phenomenon**. The idea of developers as a group will change or be even swallowed up by the user group, the group of Exchanges can completely change if the viability of decentralized exchanges come to fruition etc.
I think the consensus groups will go thought a lot of changes and ideally as a trend of decentralizing power within themselves as time moves forward 
*(miners get more decentralized, maybe a better medium for the community of users to express themselves, medium for merchants to express themselves, decentralized exchanges etc)*
Even the concept of what a miner is has changed a lot in recent times with the Signalling and UASF debacle. The amount of power miners have are now being debated.
So yes the incentives should ideally guide these groups *(and dissolve the developers if it works out like that)* but so far this is becoming quite a psychological experiment with so many beautiful side effects and intricacies. I don´t really know when it all "sets in". I could take a lot of time. 
That´s why I will rather ask myself - **what does the current consensus situation look like?** 
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:23:40
But would you then argue that Developers have had little to no influence on the Bitcoin ecosystem compared to the other 4 groups?

A.Antonopoulos: "There are *five* constituencies of consensus and none have complete control over the system, all of them have to agree: **developers**, **miners**, **exchanges**, **wallets/ users**, and **merchant services**."

If BCH blocks keep coming out the pace they are now BCH will have a block reward halving every ~1 year. Block rewards are designed to be a subsidy to miners for their work until fees are adequate enough to pay for security (mining). If block reward halves in 1 year to 6,125 BCH and to 3,0625 BCH per block a year after and so on then **the only thing that would keep the miners securing the chain (mining) would be a fee market** (because the block rewards will be so low) which is a harder thing to achieve with 8MB blocks and a mentality of keeping the fees low.

I´ll answer to you from what I understand about the current situation because underneath there is still room for compassion for our fellow beings I argue.
There will be a time where everyone can be included into using bitcoin that will have a chance to be affordable *(lightning, side chains, schnorr, mast, future block size increases and whatever breakthroughs yet discovered/invented)*. Right now I argue it is unfortunately **not the time** for mass adoption since other goals are deemed more important (by devs) for the time being. This is a time of preparations. Getting ready for winter. The cyberpunks that lead this effort (Core devs) are a paranoid bunch and with good reason: there is history of other digital money being shut down by government because they could be shut down (some core devs even have first hand exp. in that!) and also looking at the various power abuses that stems from governments around the world. 
**When** (not if) governments turn against Bitcoin they will be a formidable adversary since governments will have unlimited resources. So with eyes looking forward to that possible future outcome Bitcoin is being developed currently to be the most resistant as possible while at the same time it still needs to be usable and show growth for it to achieve it´s long term goal of adoption. 
It has been argued by Core devs that a block size increase as the main scaling solution at this point in time is not in line with the goal of anti-fragility and resistance and it carries with itself potential destabilization of the whole system which is a careful balancing act of many components. 
The effort being pushed currently is towards scaling in ways that are deemed more in line with the long term goals of survival and prosperity. This has the current negative consequences like being out priced for the third world countries. Actually it is even not possible to be used for daily activities even in first world countries since the network could not possibly handle that use case as the capacity of the network is laughable at the moment anyway.
But the time will come when steps have been made and battles have been fought when Bitcoin will reach even the hands of the poor. Well either bitcoin or something else because who can forecast the future!? But anyway we need patience for that since distributed database scaling issue (the main crux, the mother of all problems in decentralized databases) has yet to be solved and Bitcoin has in my opinion the brightest minds (quantity and quality!) behind it and hence the best probability for solving it.

what he probably means is that the extra $ you paid was probably because of bitcoin transaction fee. It is common to pay 20-30+ cents per transaction for fees.

The Core client is developed by a group of individuals - yes that is true. But this is not a closed society, anyone is welcome to join and contribute but not everything someone produces is going to be accepted. In a simplified way it takes *hard work*, *skill*, *good and needed ideas* and *time* to gain the support of most of the other contributors to get your ideas passed. This is a strong vetting process. History in the Bitcoin space has shown that contributors who are respected but then propose an idea that is not acceptable to the majority of them will get their idea rejected regardless of the individuals involved or their prior status.
You cannot buy improvements/changes to the Bitcoin Core client with money because there is no-one in power to give money to (you would have to buy most of the contributors if that was even possible seeing how many of them are showing and have shown integrity IMHO). Now people with lost of money in this space might feel like they have a lot of power or/and they feel they deserve power (since in our society money can easily mean power) but the truth is that this money does not grant them power over Bitcoin. 
This is the lesson some of these "powerful" individuals are learning and they do not like it. They want to change it so they can change Bitcoin as these people see fit.

**Bitmain needs "Core" to exist.** This is his ghost of an enemy he "fights" against to gain power. Just like Republicans need Democrats and vice-versa. They give identity to each other and they energize each other. If one disappears the other disappears also. 
I repeat - There is NO "Core", there can be NO "Core" to fight against. There is NO organized group of bad guys that he *needs* to blame for his fight for control. The truth is he is just swinging his fists in the air. Trying to grab control where no-one has control or has little control. 
IF the very existence of this evil "Core" is *constantly refuted* by the community (which is the truth) then Bitmain will seem like a heroin addict looking for a vein with a needle - just poking holes in the arm heedlessly. When he will be left fighting alone his true motives will become very apparent to everyone.

I have the same problem. Made my withdrawal more than a week ago and nothing. Have issued a ticket but no response.
But I think it will work out.

go to-&gt; cgpeers.com
make an account and search for "after effects" and you'll find quite a few tutorials up for grabs (torrent)
go to -&gt; mattrunks.com/en  to look at some of the videos they have made with after effects. if you search "mattrunks" at cgpeers then youll also find a torrent for that.

go for bitstamp.net. worked fast for my SEPA deposit
edit: the deposit/withdrawal fee is small.
trading fee is 0,5% and depending on your 30 day volume it can go as low as 0,2% ($150k traded). one thing they do is convert your EUR deposit to USD$ but the conv. rate seems reasonable.
