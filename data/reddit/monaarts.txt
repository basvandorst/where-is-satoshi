16,001 satisfies my OCD much better, and $16,002 even more so, and $16,003 even more than that, and so on and so on...  :-)

There have been so many predictions,  you can probably find one that will accurately depict what happened no matter what actually happens.

Here is my strategy:  
1) Make sure you’re diverse:  Don’t put all your money in one thing (or 10, for that matter).
2) Only buy what you can afford to lose:  Yeah, if you lose the $40 it might burn but will you miss your rent?  I’m guessing not.
3) Hold:  I’m a believer that digital currencies will make eventually stabilize but that’s not going to happen until they’re way, way higher than they are now.  I could have sold at $20k a couple years ago but I chose to hold (and it burned when it went down to $3k).

Just because something could have been more doesn’t mean it wasn’t the right thing to do at the time.  Next time you buy something for $100 remember you just paid $2300 in future value of money in 50 years.  ��

When did you order it?  And with credit card or bank transfer?

Uhhh, it said faking KNIFE, which does have a handle - at least my knives do.

Change over 7% for BTC... I read somewhere that this has average something like 35 times a day for the past few months.  Lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:54
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:08:55
I just bought at $16919 because I think once it hits $17k it’s going to explode and once it hits $20k it’s not going to come back down!
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:30:43
“To hold this long who bought in at 18.”  
Wasn’t that like 10 days ago?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:01:10
This.  I told my wife I wanted to invest a couple months ago and she was like “meh, okay”.  She’s done some of her own research now and just a couple days ago when it dipped she texted me saying “BUY MORE!”   Enjoy it together!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:27
You too, fine sir.

Looks like some of the futures are trading at $17k+ now.  If this really does follow other futures where the price ultimately lands somewhere close to the future price at least we’re looking at an increase... now the xxx% increase some of you have come to know but still an increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:28:15
Technically the average is aroun 99 bitcoins.  But the mean is probably like 0.05.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:02
My prediction is that people are a little stunned by what happened a few hours ago so are unsure what to do (hence the $16k it's been hovering around) but once they see things simmer down a little they'll start buying more tonight, driving the price up... I'm thinking around $17000 middle of the night eastern time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:35:14
“Stuck in the 16s for a while now.”
I’m pretty sure it was one day, literally a single calendar day. Hahhaha
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:20
Not sure... hopefully it blows it out of the water!  Here’s to hoping, anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:25:24
Last night at about midnight ET I said to my wife “it’s almost at $13k, if it drops below $13k I’m going to buy some more.”   Her response was “if you think that’s the magic number for the dip I want you to buy as much as you can!”  Fuck, you and I are lucky!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:03:56
Is it confirmed that they’re still HODL’ing?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:50
1) I think poster asking the question was joking.
2) your breakfast is fancier than any meal I ate over the last month. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:17
This is actually really fucking awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:48:48
I've been researching bitcoin for a couple years but have always been too "scared" to jump in...  Until last month.  I've bought in at:  7k, 9.5k, 11.5k, 13k, 17.7k, and just a few mins ago at 15.5k.  No regrats!  :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:52:13
If it goes down there’s certainly not going to be any prize money. ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:08:29
I’m guessing you did the same thing I did - bought bitcoin which is the largest single investment vehicle you’ve ever purchased. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:36:05
Yea - I hate those bubbles that burst and result in 60% growth in 2 weeks!  UGH!!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:58:56
Done!  All his 0.0000015 bitcoins are mine!!!  ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:06:34
That’s the plan.  As a way to get my wife to allow me to invest pretty heavily (bought about 1.25 BTC) I told her that I’d only sell half of my BTC if it covered paying off our mortgage.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:49:08
So a Chinese takeout dinner for 1 cost somewhere between $16k and $240k.  WIN for you!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:50:08
You only know 20 people?  /s
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:07:20
I saw a good analogy once that convinced me to keep buying and holding bitcoin....   bitcoin is to fiat currencies as email is snail mail.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:28
My prediction is $21k sometime tomorrow too.  I assume that’s what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:25:51
Exactly 1.0 BTC but looking for the right time to buy exactly 1.0 more BTC.  HODL’ing
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:14:55
Who knows - but this kinda makes sense...  
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:52:36
Uhhh, I’m guessing a large population in Asia is awake at this time and in a few more hours Europe. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:39:13
Uhhh, yes it is.  You’d have $2,500 more, which is 2.5% of $100k.  Investments 101 - know how to calculate percentages. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:17:05
If it breaks $17k I think it’s going to get out of control!!   Sooo close!!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:29
Nope.  ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:19:57
Can you publish the results so we can see what others thing?

Is this officially the first fictional bitcoin story?  lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:14:37
It’s so annoying... it’s currently &lt; $200 off breaking this psychological barrier!  JUST DO IT!!!

It's not working for me.  Still says temp disabled.  :-(

Meh - kind of.  If it's paid off then it's considered a liability.  House (more-so property) value doesn't really depreciate.

When I read the title I wasn’t sure if this was intended for r/Bitcoin or r/STD

It’s a trading market that essentially lets people bet whether bitcoin will close over or under a certain price on a certain date. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:49:17
Looks like everyone’s guessing in the realm of $16,500 and $18,000.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:58:05
Well fuck, aren’t you optimistic?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:41:54
I have a feeling that should take the Guinness Record for most expensive Chinese food takeout ever.  hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:48:07
What does that even mean?  Please show me how you’re doing your math to get to 17% difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:50:56
My problem with this is that everyone is comparing BTC to stocks, loans, etc. but it’s not.  It’s  something entirely different that serves an entirely different purpose in our global, economical landscape.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:27:32
Adoption. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:27:01
This sounds off... are you sure!?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:39:17
So you put $1000 in yesterday and you’re about to lose it because you’re at the same place 24 hours later...?
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:35:05
Own stock?  How’d that work out over the last 30 years for the “top” companies?
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:24:30
It increased 25+% in a single day previously....  So this isn’t unheard of. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:10:22
If it increases 0.83% every day until then, it will be over $1million.
