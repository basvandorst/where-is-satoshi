I did not file a police report because I live in Brazil and they barely solve daily regular crimes. They have no idea on blockchain, etcetera, plus this person lives who knows where, making it harder to go after him. 
I can prove it was my btc because it was taken from an address I still have the keys. I traced the transactions and noticed one of the receiving address is a bitfinex wallet. I originally reported it here: 
I understand the receptor of this at bitfinex may not be the criminal, but it could provide some clues.

What if I just send the transactions without fees (raw transactions)? Would they get lost or would they just get unconfirmed so that I could spend them again after some time? Would it fill the 1mb blocks if I push like 500 transactions per second?

Good idea. 3 rices on me @_date: 2014-02-17 14:28:20
What does guarantee that after all coins are mined, people will actually pay fees to the network? The only incentive on paying fees is the speed of confirmations. Is that enough to make people pay fees to the network?

Money being debt and the obscure and apparently harmful way it is created, generating inflation and all the devil mean... I ask(sincerily curious): governments do it for a reason, right? What reason would that be? How and why would they avoid doing so? Like the other half of the story.

Hello, 
Thanks for taking time to share your thoughts about accepting bitcoins. 
I see that we don't accept bitcoins as a payment method on our website at this time. 
..... Same for the rest

I am convincing this business owner(to accept bitcoin) and he is considering it, what you guys think? I quit smoking using their product, it was the only method that worked for me.
BRAVO® is the only clinically tested non-nicotine smoking product in the world today. BRAVO®, made from the leaves of pure healthy lettuce, looks like a cigarette, is packaged like a cigarette, draws like a cigarette and tastes (well pretty close) like a cigarette, but ... BRAVO® does not contain any tobacco and is nicotine free.

So my bitaddress generated address goes public when I create it on bitaddress.org? Or when I load into blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-05-16 12:54:26
I believe he wanted to protect us(the revolution and revolutioners), not himself, because if he was jailed, then we would have a serious hurt in legitimation as the "creator of bitcoin" would then be a criminal behind the jails. Whenever anyone would try to talk about bitcoin to a new person, that would be the first thing to pop up: "Oh, I know, that thing whose creator got jailed, yea, obviously risky and shady, no interest, bye". So he protected Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, the figure, the icon, not himself. Since his stash is untouched and he seems very detached from world goods, I believe he wouldnt care at all to be jailed as long as it would be for the good of the revolution, not for the bad.

@_date: 2015-01-02 11:37:12
No teamview and as I said, theres no email from blockchain for the 2fa code, just the email about the transaction. That means apparently nobody logged in, they just stolen somehow
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:33:30
Sorry I didnt follow. Run wireshark or tcpdump and check some packet and see if it is encrypted and check source is blockchain.info, is that something about this?

This is what I was going to reply. Isps and telecoms arent just paper corporations. They built AND keep building thousands of miles of new fiber paths every day. 
If your plan is for wifi devices, who is going to connect cities, countries? You cant replace telcos/isps that easy. Maybe when quantum physics gift us with large data teletransportation then the hole of telcos/isps can be brought to table again.
Maidsafe is about to launch and it delivers solutions for most of your concerns. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:13:40

1. I am 100% confident I didnt log in into a phishing site. In fact, it has been a long time I dont login on BCI at all.
2. I dont use TOR
3. I didnt make wallet backups(I know I should)
4. My email is also 2FA and has not been compromised.
5. None of my other services nor anything seems compromised, except for this bitcoin transaction from blockchain.info

Last time I logged in was from my computer, my office, on December 12, 2014. I know this information from my 2FA email I receive.
I have 2FA enabled for at least 1+ year.

@_date: 2015-01-02 13:59:16

There are no coins at your hard drive, but a key to spend them. The coins are at the distributed blockchain. That is why it is called a private key. Only you have it and it grants you the right to spend your coins that "stored" at the blockchain.
