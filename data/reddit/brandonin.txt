I love gemini. I just wish they would use google 2factor auth...

I think this would assume I already tied my phone number with google hangouts before I left the country?

This has to be one of the most condescending comments I have ever read. The writer of this post clearly comes from a position of privilege and forgets to mention the reason why this marxist government came into existence and why people backed it. Of course you forget to mention all the carpet bombs that Cambodia went through from the United State government that led up to the Pol Pot Regime and the fact that Vietnam had to intervene during the Khmer Rouge when after the Cambodian Government was left in shambles after a failed attempt for the US Government to take control under the Khmer Republic. So yea, these people have been devastated by wars created by foreign entities in order to economically enslave them. But fuck your bigotry.

Good Luck in Phnom Penh man. Try to make it to Koh Rong, Siem Reap or kompot.

I think this is extremely misguided. It’s actually a chinese cryptocurrency disguised as the national Cambodian currency. The two cofounders are chinese and the dev team is probably chinese. Just another neoimperialist solution for foreigners to control the Cambodian government.
