Surely people can see that the claim is quite illogical. If someone really has that much BTC stuck in a trust until 2020, that person rationally would not want to sabotage the price of BTC by threatening to drive it down to 1000? He can just sit back and retire a billionaire in 2020? Why bother with BSV?

no. Kleiman's lawyers can still use it as evidence in courts.

He has already been accused of perjury once in the same court.

Shouldn't he be arrested for that offence already?

Someone explain this please. 
If Craig is Satoshi, why did he have to seek 15 millions from outsiders to clear the debts of his companies (as per  [ )?
Surely, he can easily sell his bitcoin holdings to raise a mere 15 million? After all, he claim here that he has 1 million BTC and is richer than an entire country

he doesn't own much, otherwise his companies would not be in debt that he has to sell out for mere 25 millions
