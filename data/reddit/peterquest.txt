Fool me once,  shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times, you don't fool me three times I bought the same dip you did.

There are commonly "sell walls" at round numbers because humans are stupid. 
This post is making a joke about this concept by placing that artificial wall at an arbitrary point rather than a number ending in one or more zeroes.

Wasn't there just a post yesterday about not disclosing how much bitcoin you actually own? Seems like he's maybe just making a wise business decision.

My dad talked me out of buying at $7 because he started talking about how volatile a currency would be if it wasn't basically backed by a military. 
My dad is a pretty smart guy, and he's right that crypto is still very volatile. But when you're talking about a paradigm shift, it is understandable that you can't really see it as a viable alternative. 
I ended up buying at 500. And again at 900. And again at 1500. And again at 3200. And again at 5600 (during the last dip!)
Everyone is going to have regrets on the path to the moon, but my bigger hope for bitcoin is not that i make a bunch of money. It's that crypto actually changes the way the world works. That might be naive, but there is certainly room for improvement in our financial systems. Hopefully we are moving in the right direction.

This is why so many people are concerned about exchanges I guess. 
Hopefully this exposure makes a difference.

If bitcoins are always being lost at a certain rate, and there are a finite number of bitcoins, does it stand to reason that on a long enough timeline all bitcoins will eventually be lost?

It's from an australian musician who made this song as a joke (kinda like the lonely island guys..) named Kirin J Callinan..
It has been well meme'd...
edit: the cowboy is actually [Jimmy Barnes]( who was a popular musician in the 80's and 90's who they asked to be a part of it I guess for the lulz
edit2: [the 10 hour cut]( which I have definitely watched all of at least once...

Yeah this was a collaboration specifically for this music video. It was kind of a big deal in Australia apparently. I'll see if I can find some of the news clips about it.
