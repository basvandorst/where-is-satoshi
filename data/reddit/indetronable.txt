You cannot drop bitcoin price even with tether. You can just pump it.

Does Electrum run faster than Bitcoin Core ? Bitcoin core is running for a 10 hours and he still late for 1 year and 20 weeks...
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:27:06
Bro, let's be serious for 1 sec.
1 MB blocks every 10 min ?
Even me, with my tiny laptop, as a student, afk 10 hours a day, I use [81 GB a month]( ie 18 MB per 10 min.
What is the technical limitation to not have 8 MB Blocks ? Anyone can send a 8 MB block from anywhere to anywhere in less than 5 sec !
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:18:36
When Bitcoin blocks were not full, there was a fee market. Litecoin blocks are not full but has a fee market. Moreover the bigger your block is, the more chance he have to be orphaned so taking a to few fee with the risk of loosing 12.5 BTC is not worth it.
If you create a block that include a 0.0000001 BTC of fee more than another miner because there is one more transaction, it mean that there is a chance that the other miner block gets verified faster. It's simple maths : (+ 0.0000000001 BTC of fee and + 1 chance of loosing everything) or  (- 0.0000000001 BTC of fee and - 1 chance of loosing everything)
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:23:08
Really bro ?

A BCC pool that mine a 2MB BCC block on the BCC chain to say "Fuck Bitcoin Cash", that's funny but does not make any sense.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:54:06
Bitcoin has a minimum sat/b for low payments.
Moreover, if Antpool spam the network, there is other honest miners that are going to take all the money.
And if Antpool does not want to include a tx in a block, it is their right no ? that's why Bitcoin is open source, you create the software you want. If you don't like tx that end with a 13 then don't include them in your blocks, that's up to you. Somebody else is going to mine them anyway.
Why create spam and recover their own money when they can just mine empty blocks ?
If they want to create a bug on software's fee estimation, why not just mine tx with really high fees but not broadcast to the network ? They create 2000 tx with .01 BTC as fee, does not broadcast them. Mine them anyway. They get their money back and the fee estimation on every software would be .01 BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:04:28
Bro, You won't find a block &gt; 1 MB on blockexplorer ! If you want to see the fork, you have to go on an explorer that support Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:07:21
Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second.
Assuming a normal person is doing 2 transactions per day (in fact i am really far from the 60 transactions per month), Bitcoin can handle a city of 7 * 3600 * 24 / 2 = 302 400 peoples.
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:23:46


That's true. Having 50.00000000000001% is enough. Having 1e-5% with a lot of luck too.


This is not true. It's not because the results are the same that the cause are the same. It's like saying "hey Antpool, you did 110 Ghash today, so useless lol because only 2 of them were useful to find a block. I cannot distinguish the blockchain without those 110 Ghash - 2 hash so you don't secure the network.".


Let's now say those 300 MH/s were done by Antpool but were still unsucessful. Did there secure the network ? If yes, what did change ?

Bitcoin has a way to distribute the money but this is not inflation. When you say "BTC has ~3% annual inflation." you mean that BTC will need an infinite supply.
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:49:36
You are talking about inflation. On bitcoin ?

This is false. It will happen only once per adjustment period.

This is not how things work. If they had 0.51% of the hashrate, according to your maths, they would have 0.51^7=0.8%. This is obviously false.

Miners often use 0 fee transaction for their own transactions. This may be a problem.
You should take percentile 95.

Since the price changes 3 times per second, how do you do to agree on the number ?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:56:25
100% agreed. As a big blockers, as long as you don't do that, I will think that you can't.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:11:45
So where is Mr Economics ?
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:11:25


[Like this one ?]( With the money they are moving, they are WAY more into Bitcoin than you and me. There is probably something you don't get here.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:38:15
It's like when you have a bus. You can sell more cheaper to fill the bus. But you can't sell the remaining place for 1 cent because it doesn't even pay for the oil.
Here it is the same. A bigger block means a harder to propagate block witch means maybe loosing 12.5 BTC.
I am a big blocker but I am realistic. No matter what, a transaction should have a cost. A world where anything is free is just a lie. You pay for the device you use to issue the transaction. You pay for the electricity you use on that device. And finally you pay the miner.
***Bitcoin is designed for a world where miners and users are selfish***.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:01:46
There is an artificial fee market because the fee market is not between supply and demand but between an artificial block size and demand.
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:09:38
If Segwit is a blocksize increase, then Segwit is a HF.
Moreover, Segwit2x is Segwit then a 2 MB Block size increase HF. If Segwit is already a blocksize increase, what is Segwit2x ?

Srious : what exchange does not require personal information ? Just need 50$ BTC in an anonymous way.

Yeah, you are right. People here just talk about things they don't understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:37:15
The blocks are going to be as large as the market can offer. And even if they do so, what will be the point ? Normal people are still going to have their transaction confirmed because they pay more fees. They will just create like 10MB blocks for a while, they will loose money then they will stop.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:44:56
U can't know if a block is a chinese one or not.
U can't really do 1gb blocks because you will have 24*6 GB à day. It will be 1 TB à week. Only big corporation can handle such a storage.

@_date: 2017-06-04 11:55:48
Bro, one day or another, bitcoin will have bigger blocks. Not today, not tomorrow, maybe in 10 years but then you will be a big blocker.
Moreover, big blockers are not against the fee market. They are against artificial fee market. There will be also a fee market if you slow the Bitcoin block size to 150kB but I am not sure it will be healthy.
Hope I won't be banned.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:31:28
Bitcoin was without full blocks. So Bitcoin was not good before ?
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:40:36
That's what people say but my question is... So what ? A block get orphaned, where is the problem ? Like just "Unlucky bro, mine another block".
Euthereum has a block time of 7 sec !
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:32:53
A market is a competition between supply and demand. The demand here are user that want to push a transaction. Supply is limited space. Why is the space limited ? IMO the space has to be limited because of technological issues and not a "if(block_size &gt; 1 MB) reject()".
In fact without that "if", there is a lot of technological limitation that are going to limit the size of blocks anyway :
 * the bigger the block is, the more time he will need to propagate so more chance to be orphaned
 * the bigger the block is, the more time he needs to be validated so more chance to be orphaned
