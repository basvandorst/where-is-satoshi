wtf is this from, this is sooo great, must rewatch, now.....

haha no man. the only thing possible, it could go to 0. you will never owe somebody anything. your problem might be to buy bitcoins for 10. dont know if any exchange would sell you that low amount. maybe buy some face to face.

I found out about it from time to time in some internet newspaper headlines and always wanted to really read about it. Then, in late april this year i had some spare time at work and read on wikipedia about it.....myself being in the web/internet-sector i immediately made big eyes on what i read there. I may have only understood like 40% of what i read in that moment but hell.... i knew this was straight out of some science fiction novel. And i really started to sweat after looking into that article for 5 minutes. It think it felt like when i would have witnessed the first iphone-introduction-keynote by steve year back. A phone to touch with a real browser, WHOOAA. I told my colleague, sitting next to me, about WTF i did just read.  He nodded his head and asked me what bitcoin is backed by. I didnt had an answer. He told me its shit. One week later i bought some. And months later more. Now i keep and spend. And love...Bitcoins.

i did that too recently. i can only repeat that the quality of the cards is good. i also ordered two receive-cards with my own key, like "to the base" (home-computer) and "to the moon" (for coinbase) so i have them as an qr code in my RL-wallet. (though i have problems scanning some qr-codes with my iphone on those wallet cards- but the full address is written on them anyway...so i go that way)....cant warrant for the way that private key is hidden under that hologram. did you understand that completely?....sound like we need to trust them that no internet-connected device is used during production. i used one card deposited money, removed the hologram and imported it back correctly but....
to make it short:
good quality
very fast delivery
qr codes on wallet cards a bit too small

yes man, exactly my feelings. at one time i thought about cashing out my invesments, just to be sure. But as i see it now i buy a lot of pizzas and other stuff with bitcoin and that small amount i have on my coinbase-app just doesn't get really smaller. So it really makes me feel not like losing bitcoins but endlessly generating fiat currency as btcs rice in price. Eagerly awaiting my apple tv from amazon bought via joinsnapcard.com. Only heard good of them.

i have problems when looking for a https checkout. when i create a new account and sent PW,name and address, looks like its realy in beta and https is missing :(

i feel you, but it rly shouldnt control your life. close all tabs and tickers and only visit them on set times during the day, like each 4-5 hrs, otherwise you get insane or get problems trying to find sleep at night. its just a chart and much can and will change. If btc goes down you're suddenly in a bad mood and that sucks. So stop it watching every minute. when you're in for the long run it doesnt matter anyway. go on and try to play computer games or whatever you did before you knew bitcoin.

looking at the price right now its getting close to where i'd feel uncomfortably with 0.25 bitcoins on coinbase. but thats just my feeling. you can keep them there but maybe learn about deskotp-wallets like multibit. start small and send a tiny amount from cb to there and back and so on. get familiar with it. you can spend directly via coinbase or that multibit wallet. whatever you prefer.
and start reading the sidebar. really :). after this. try yourself on your first cold storage offline wallet. also please start with small amounts in case you make mistakes.
