Cryptoversity is my fav. The host is to the point, offers enlightening mindsets, and quite organized.

this is some damn fine advice.

That GAW miner story is pretty fascinating. I came into the crypto space just after the dust settled. Phew.
As for the coinbase allegations. I really hope Charlie doesn’t turn out to be who the community thinks he is. I wonder who the coinbase employee is that brought the evidence to the government. 
Grab zee popcorn

Are there any other platforms worth exploring beyond Reddit?

I think we should get a regular warning post like this every few weeks. A constant reminder that the crypto currency space is volatile and one should always proceed with caution.

I shall check it out

Personally I'm a big fan of the lesser known platforms that deliver the core features very well. Perhaps reddit before it was 'mainstream'. Not really different, just less noise.

You can use 
This will show you the volume for each exchange in the last 24 hours. Looking at the BTC/KRW and BTC/JPY trading pairs will help determine where the price action is coming from.

Hmm, interesting thought. Pump one side take profits, buy up the coins on the dumping side. Repeat

So where do these bitcoins end up?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:46:05
Inflation is obviously good, because if it weren’t so expensive I’d eat all the french fries /s

Shouldn’t they be patching meltdown and spectre CPU bugs?!

Will do m8

Ooohh, so they create side channels to execute different projects. I see now, thanks for that

So do you only talk to internet strangers about crypto? I find it too hard not to spread the word about this technology 
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:27:22
Now don't forget to replace those bitcoins

Proper legal council is next on my list once I wrap my head around everything.
I'm researching what you need to become an MSB (Money Services Business). Of course it requires bitcoin to be recognized as a currency to fit the requirements. Otherwise its an extremely lengthy and costly process. Though better safe than sorry
