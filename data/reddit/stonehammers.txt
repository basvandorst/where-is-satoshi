I doubt that :P What aspects are you having issues with? The network, mempool, the blockchain (the ledger), wallets (your private key chain), the mining pools (where new bitcoins are created), mining hash functions (the proof of work system), encryption in general? I think the video I linked will help. Anyone can learn this stuff you just need to be curious. Good luck.

I would have done the same as would most people.  If someone threatened to have you locked in a small box for the rest of your life Would you not be willing to kill the same random ass hole holding your life in his hands? 95 out of 100 people would have done the same. Edit: In my mind it's no deterrent from someone coming up to you in the middle of the night and sticking a gun in your face. The end result is the same, your life essentially ends. I would be just as willing to kill the guy with the gun as anyone on the web threatening to end my life. I would not shed a single fucking tear ether.

No one died though. Should he really get life while child rapists and murders get out in only a few years? In the grand view of the world people are alive and walking around today who would have died on the street trying to sell or buy drugs that would not be alive if the silk road never existed. He should be a hero. He's my fucking hero. The silk road was by far the safest way for dumb ass kids to buy drugs without contributing to inner city crime. If all drugs were sold online their would be no gangs. MS13 would not exist. Online drug sells will end the war on drugs.

You should show the price of BTC on the top 3 exchanges so consumers can see that your price is way higher.

How many Alt-Coins have forked from the Bitcoin block chain and whats the best way to scrape old wallets that have a Zero balance for alt coins that broke off from Bitcoin network over the last year?

@_date: 2017-12-12 23:26:49
I'm in the same boat as you. Sent a tx before my Bitcoin core wallet was finished updating and the suggested fee was 30 satoshes. That was a few days ago and now the price has gone up so much I'm waiting for my wallet to let me abandon it so i can double spend it thus preventing the other party from rebroadcasting it later.  Edit:  shows the mem pool is continuing to grow at an alarming rate. Edit I don't know about breadwallet but Bitcoin core lets you add more fee after 42 hours I think. Never used it before. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:32
Edit: just spent 23 bucks on transaction fees and it still took two blocks to get in.

If it slides under 6k again or drops and does not go back up ... it will be a blood bath.

Are you saying it can't be done, shouldn't be done or just that consensus would never agree to it? Are you objecting to the idea because you believe its not technically possible to retrofit the network or just impractical? Are you saying its unnecessary? What do you mean by 'Wrong coin"? Are you implying I shouldn't even ask such a question here? Would the idea of implementing ring signatures into the bitcoin network be so outrageous?  You clearly reject the idea outright but why?

No, even if the app is clean it can be compromised during download if hosted by a third party like the android play store. Automatic update is also a risk if the repository the client downloads from has been taken over by a gov agency. Also look at what happened to TrueCrypt, the government found a way to crack it and still no one knows how.  The best coders in the world can hide back doors in plain sight. Every one of the core Devs of bitcoin will tell you the same thing. "security is hard"

Interesting "unrelated" trivia If you want to ensure you find out if your encryption is ever broken send 'presidential-death threats' along with your e-mails. Any Gov agency capable of un-encrypting your data will find these death-threats and be forced by law to send out agents to question you about it.  I hear the ACLU uses something like this.
*adjusts tin foil hat*  
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:20:26
No, But I read somewhere a few years back the gov can crack TrueCrypts full disk encryption, (some peeps went to jail for spying or something) its likely attributable to firmware on the SSDs or HDDs. Or a back door in the OS or motherboard firmware or Intel's CPUs random number generator... I don't fucking know but dose it even matter where to back door is? It could be any program running on the same device. For all we know Minecraft and Fortnight have NSA back doors that monitor your bitcoin clients, store encryption keys and send your dick pics back to NSA HQ.

Currency is created as debt when a bank makes a loan to someone. When the interest rate is increased that mans the borrower will have to pay more back thus creating more debt thus more currency.  
If all outstanding loans were magically paid off in full all US currency would vanish. Debt is money, money is debt. Its the same thing. By raising the interest rate all the outstanding debt in the US dollars will start to grow faster then it has in the last 10 years. The US now has more debt then at any time in its history so this small increase to interest rates could unleash a massive wave of inflation over the coming years. Historically this has been handled by pushing the debt into the stock market and letting the investors to take the hit. But in a world of "to big to fail" the government may end up bailing out the banks again.

If we had truly cheap (1 cent) and instant transactions then ya Bitcoin could become the one world currency we all dream it could be.

Fuck the IRS. Fuck paying taxes, something like 40% of the money collected in taxes is spent on bombing brown people in the middle east in a giant dick waving contest. Four to seven percent of the net worth of any nation that uses USD is stolen every year by the FED through inflation. It's taxation without representation it goes against everything the United states was meant to represent. Did you know 13 percent of adult black men or 4 percent of all Americans can't vote. And even if you can vote your options are limited if you want your vote to matter, you can vote for the stupid party or the asshole party. Give me direct democracy give me real choices. Until then fuck the IRS I consider myself a sovereign nation unto itself. Edit: spelling. Would also like to add that 20% of the money collected in taxes is spent on interest on money we borrow. This number will continue to grow over the next 10 years to 30%.

What will this money be used for?  It reads: "Coinbase said that it would use the funds to expand its customer support and engineering teams" but thats bull shit It will likely be used to develop Lightning network clients and web based user interfaces for off chain transaction services.

Lots of things have contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin price but most of it is due to implications that come with Segwit.  I like to think of Segwit as phase two. Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology all on its own but with Segwit we gain near instantaneous and free transactions (off chain) with bidirectional payment channels. its a paradigm shift on top of a paradigm shift.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:06:17
Layer two, Level two, Phase two call it what you want its a huge step forward for Bitcoin. Segwit will bring instantaneous micro transactions at zero cost. Zero.

@_date: 2017-08-28 12:53:11
Support for 2x is stronger then people here will admit. I have been a long time 1mb block supporter and even I think it might be time to up the block size. It might be best for Core just to support it and avoid another fork. Because the way I see it, come winter we are going to have 3 version of Bitcoin unless we can make compromise.  That is unless LN is coming soon. And GUI options to use segWit wallets.

I been wanting to ask this question but did't want to look dumb. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:50:52
I"m no expert and I only speak for myself but last I checked core and the community does not support a block size increase. The 1MB block limit is there to prevent spam. And the community and core both feel that the vast amount of transactions are 'spam' or micro transactions that should be pushed off chain into payment channels.  They have no issue with raising the block size after segwit is enabled as long as its really needed. It is true someone could try to reverse a LN transaction but if they do and you are online to catch them in the act you can take not only your bitcoins but also all of their Bitcoins in the channel so its more risky for them to try anything. 
I don't know what your talking about "default-en-masse attack using full blocks" there are no blocks in LN payment channels. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:39:51

SegWit has not increased capacity to 11 tps its just hash rate variance from the miners jumping back and forth from BCash to Bitcoin screwing with the interval between blocks.  Personally I'm a little concerned by this new dynamic and its possible long term implication.  
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:23:09
WTF is a pre-printed paying-in slip?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:06:31
Core has never been against raising the block size (after SegWit) if its needed. If companies want to be dicks and try and charge fees people may resort to using a LN topography closer too a bit-torrent swarm without a central hub (just random users you don't know) but this would be more risky for the end user or a lot slower.  
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:54:30
As more and more people move their coins to segwit wallets it will help a little. The real advantage will come with LN (Lightning_Network) adoption for micro payments.

The bitcoin miners in China have been using something they call ASIC-Boost. It allowed them to gain 20% efficiency over other miners. This was really good for them but to use ASIC-Boost they had to create spam. These spam transactions did not propagate across the network like other transactions they originated at the exact moment the blocks were created by the miners themselves. Again great for them but bad for the network. Segwit fixed this 'issue' So after segwit is enabled we should see a nice drop in spam (created by Bitmain and others who use their hardware) for the soul purpose of increasing mining efficiency. 
I know of no better way to judge the community support then to look at the full node software they  run.  You don't have to be an intermediary you can open one directional payment channel... think Starbucks gift card or A payment channel that is only to be used at Amazon.com. You can also open a payment channel with a hub but that does not make you a intermediary. You would only need to be an intermediary if there were no hubs you could trust and opted for a bit-torrent like topography. This is not the aim of Core. They want people to use hubs.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:15:05
No. We still need LN applications, service providers and there is now a strong demand for hardware wallets so those will also need to be integrated. A person opening up a payment channel with a hub may be asked to pay a fee but i doubt it. (correction: opening and closing a payment channel requires a transaction fee for the block chain. )In any case we won't have to wait for very long to find out. Once a payment channel has been opened it can remain open for years. But you can close a payment channel at any time to collect the final balance of that channel. You could think of LN as a checking account with free transactions and where your wallet is a savings account.

If you spend all your funds in a payment channel I think you just close it and open a new one but I could be wrong I'm no expert on this. Who knows you may be able to refill them. It's true that bidirectional payment channel hubs (likely large companies) will need to be very rich to facilitate large volume throughput... like really rich. That could limit the number of hubs. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:11:36
The higher the market cap the higher the chance hedge funds will invest in bitcoin.

I respect these sentiments, I really do your preaching to the quire I run a full node on a shitty internet connection, I know the danger of larger blocks... But I also believe people should be able to send average sized transactions within 1h for less then 1 dollar's worth of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:04:05

Fuck the IRS. Fuck paying taxes, something like 40% of the money collected in taxes is spent on bombing brown people in the middle east in a giant dick waving contest. Four to seven percent of the net worth of any nation that uses USD is stolen every year by the FED through inflation. It's taxation without representation it goes against everything the United states was meant to represent. Did you know 13 percent of adult black men or 4 percent of all Americans can't vote. And even if you can vote your options are limited if you want your vote to matter, you can vote for the stupid party or the asshole party. Give me direct democracy give me real choices. Until then fuck the IRS I consider myself a sovereign nation unto itself. Edit: spelling. Would also like to add that 20% of the money collected in taxes is spent on interest on money we borrow. This number will continue to grow over the next 10 years to 30%.

For a long time I thought the root of all evil was economic injustice and that the majority of the worlds woes could be rectified, as a consequence of the rearrangement of social organizations to a more socialistic governance model but if you're honest with yourselves you should see some of it is due to intellectual inequality. You can not encapsulate all the worlds problems into social economics alone.

Coinbase and Coinbase-pro is the same company they use the same login information. You can log in to coinbase and then go to coinbase pro and find you are already loged in. It's free in that their are no extra fees. It's like an e-trade for crypto. While regular coinbase is ... a more stream lined service for people who don't want to day-trade.

Yes if I'm a selfish miner I now have many ways to affect the speed of propagation of my blocks across the network.  I can create blocks that will propagate slower or faster depending on my selfish mining strategy.  New technies are being tested new options available. Large mining pools have their own networks now that move blocks much faster and you can build your own blocks to be harder to confirm so they propagate much slower.

All exchanges go down over a long enough time frame. Don't store your coins on an exchange if you can avoid it, you could lose everything.  But yes you can buy and sell from a mobile app (I'v never one myself) It's a real pain in the ass to set up an account with coinbase but it will save you money in the long run. learn the difference between a market order and a limit order. Use Limit. market has higher fees.

I agree with everything you said but this last line. 
It comes off to me as willful ignorance. Bitcoin use and online security go hand in hand I hold this to be self evident.  Lots of bitcoins are stored in online accounts that can and do get hacked and most hacks of these bitcoin accounts start with the e-mail. E-mail security is the weakest link for the vast majority of people who hold bitcoins.

Yes, More mining hardware is added to the network every hour of every day and the network auto adjusts the difficulty.
Bitmain builds those miners for 1/10 of what you paid for them. So every time someone buys one they build atleast two more for their mining farm. 
These links might help  
and 
And every 4 years the block reward is cut in half. 
Just look at this 
The difficulty is going up faster then at any time in the past. Your calculations are not going to be worth shit.

Oh I have and most of these BTMs are complete scams with outrageous fees once you calculate the fair price on a major exchange. They might say 3% but then they set the price of the coins you buy 30% higher then the market price, 30% lower if your selling. These BTMs go against everything Bitcoin is suppose to represent.  For every fair BTM you will find 100 more that are cheating their costumers out of so much money it should be illegal. We as a community should be ashamed of these things and yet most of us celebrate them as a sign of adoption when in fact they are doing real damage to long term growth by extracting such high fees on their users.

OP you need to learn how to set them up before you get them. You will make most of your money in the first few weeks. You need to learn how to connect to the miners via local IP address. You may need to change their default IP address so they don't conflict.  Set up an account on Slush's Pool his is the best around. Go to Youtube and look for videos on how to do this.  Did you buy a Power supply with them? You will need to buy external Power supply units they don't come with PSU's. You will need to buy or build your own jumper Pins for the PSUs.

My issues are thus, cheap hardware components prone to failure, hardware wallets that don't have clear cases so you can see the inside circuitry to prevent tampering, no warrant canaries on the manufactures websites opening the door to governments potentially, secretly forcing them into pushing out malicious code. The threat of scammers selling fake devices, the threat of re-sellers (think E-bay) selling devices already set up and the user not knowing to reset the device before first use. The threat of users thinking these devices are all in one security solutions and that they never need to worry about security again because they are 100% protected!  The reduced security provided by mnemonic word lists over raw random number generators + mouse movement + date time ect ect. And the black hole sun that is the fact that at the end of the day you still have to back up that fucking word list. And if you want to carve it into a hunk of aluminum and drop it in a hole in your backyard that's fine but that doesn't come without it's own risks. Better to store it on a heavily encrypted file using obfuscation so you can access from anywhere in the world. But having said all that I have no issue with people who know what they are doing from using these devices. Mostly I have an issue ignorant people using them and thinking they are safe and protected up to the point their house burns down or their wife sells the picture frame they were using to hide their word list. Then they lose everything. People need to have a clear logical plan for recovery and backup. Hardware wallets are just adornments they are not the end all be all solution to anything.

Central banks already have significant control over our nation's money supply and our inflation rate.

You may think your secure with your hardware wallet but whats stopping someone from stealing a victims hardware wallet  and replacing it with a fake identical one that's malicious and records the pins and broadcasts them to an attacker? How hard would it be to cram a wifi chip into one of these little boxes with the hardware needed to record the screen output and your finger inputs?

Every day counts you need to have those things up and running within hours of delivery. You will make more in your first week then you will in the last 6 months of your ROI. I think you can set up text alerts on the pools in the event your miner goes down. You might also want to order a spare controller I had one burn out on me once.  If you bought a cheap PSU you can burn out the controller. Mine use to crash/glitch-out every few days and require a restart.  You can over clock them... If you can keep the temp down. Might be worth it for the first week. Once you pass the point they are no longer profitable to run you can sell them or under clock them.

SN had originally intended for miners to have all the power. But they don't. Full Nodes can blacklist mining pools, blockade them, push them to very edge of the network and prevent them from propagating new blocks across the network.  This is called a User activated hardfork. Users hold all the power now. And its for the best because 60 to 70% of all mining power is run by 2 to 5 people. They do not represent the wishes of the user base.

Wrong these things need power to hold data. A small leak over years will drain the gates inside the chips  corrupting its data. you have to power them up ever 6 to 8 months to be safe. They need power to top off the gates. They drain just like batteries. If you buy a new pack of batteries and leave them for 8 years they won't work very well, they will have leaked power over that time. Same is true for flash memory.  They did't tell you that did they? Look you been warned. Its your money do with it as you please. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:13:52
Yeah for years most blocks were below 1MB. But even today when a miner finds a block it begins to compile a new list of transactions to go into the next block (not the one it just found) but to save time they start to hash empty blocks because that process takes additional time. On rare events miners find two or more blocks in rapid succession when this happens empty or near empty blocks are mined. So yeah what the other guys said its not a fixed amount.
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:12:41
Hardware wallets are just USB memory sticks with some extra bits. They all suck don't use them for long term storage you will regret it.  They are no more reliable then a shitty 10 dollar memory stick you might find at wall-mart. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:33:43
They have the same kind of hardware as any cheap memory stick.
If anything they should have a higher failure rate because they have more parts that can break. 
If they go for more then 18 months without power you could easily corrupt all your data just like a USB memory stick.

Right here, I"m fucking telling you. Right here and right now, Have you ever used memory sticks before? They go bad all the time these Hardware wallets are no deferent they use the same type of flash memory. You will be lucky if you get one or two years out of them before they break. If you don't believe me then google it. I think the technical term is electron tunneling but I could be wrong. A simple flake of dust that fell on the chip in the factory could cause a short leading to gates getting drained. The gates don't hold very many electrons. It doesn't take much to alter the data.  You guys got a good circle jerk  going on here  I'll leave you to it.

Ok I think I understand how time locks could protect me/you but what if the the attacker posts the outdated one thats time locked with a huge fee? A miner might ignore your transaction, maybe for days, for a shot at the attackers transaction with a much larger fee. Would they rather risk losing the small fee for a chance at a massive fee in a few days? Especially if the 90% of the mining network is only 3 or 4 large pools and independent miners account for only two or three percent, something that could happen in the distant future.

Not true. I had a stuck tx for months and my wallet would not let me increase the fee, I was using the latest core client.
The options are grayed out to prevent double spends. Every time you start up your full node client it re broadcasts your transaction to the network. That has to be turned off before the client lets you use Replace by fee or the other option.  In bitcoin Core the default settings will not let you double spend a transaction thats already in the mempool.

It does not work unless the transaction your trying to replace is really old or has been kicked from the mempool but if someone else is rebroadcasting your transaction (or your client is) your shit out of luck and you still have to stop your client from broadcasting with  the command line interface or a startup commands. Again not something the average person knows how to do. If it was really as simple as a drop down option then why are their thousands of threads on this topic on Bitcointalk? The drop down option to use Replace-by-fee does not work in the core client for the average person!

Here is the official Bitcoin Core wallet made by the core development team.  
Once you have installed the client find the wallet.dat file in %appdata%/bitcoin then encrypt and back it up to at-lest 3 other locations.  You will then need to spend 1-3 days syncing your client to the network. You will need to learn how to use the client and calculate appropriate transaction fees. If you want to backup your wallet.dat file on the cloud I would use something like VeraCrypt/trucrypt to encrypt your wallet again and hide it inside a photo. Use a strong password for your online storage and never reuse passwords from other sites. Also use 2FA when signing into any cloud storage sites.  
But if you wish to convert your BTC to cash you will need to sign up for an exchange.

mnemonic words are less secure then hard encryption by a program like VeraCrypt or even true crypt and if your safty deposit box is in another state in a vault then yes $5 wrench attack won't work on it.  CDs and USB sticks do deteriorate thats why you should use 3-5 of them and power them up every few years. Not sure if you can make a encrypted paper wallet. The point is you hold the password in your home (hidden) and the wallet is encrypted on CDs/USB sticks in safety deposit boxes at least 5-6 hours drive away.

*dusts off magic eight ball* Well in two years we have the halfing of block rewards. Consolidation of supply, technical advancements, User interface improvements, hopefully user faith in them selfs will grow as more of them use their own wallets and not online wallets. Trade wars,  real wars, cold wars, inflation, automation of the workforce, these things and others will all play a part in driving people into poverty and migration. Bitcoins necessity will grow with time as weaker, poorer governments become more unstable and currencies falter. Perpetual growth is impossible. When the world economy falters taxes and inflation will raise, Bitcoin will become an exit strategy for rich and poor alike. It won't be about getting rich it will be about holding onto the wealth the little guys work so hard to earn.

I agree with him. The war in the middle east is an illegal war because congress never gave president Bush permission to start it or Obama the permission to continue it. All we needed to do was put locks on air plain cockpits, problem fixed. The attacks on the world trade center were a criminal act carried out by a religious organization, they were not an act of war; The terrorist were not solders acting on the behalf of a government. The US has killed millions of people in the middle east and they will continue to do so.  America is an evil empire. Read "A peoples history of the United states" by howard zinn.

I'm in this for the ideology, the ideology behind Bitcoin is what will sustain me. I want to protect the average Joe not exploit them. Robinhood is not safe. People need to learn to be their own bank. Buying Bitcoin on Robbinhood is no different then buying a IOU gold note from a bank. You're a sellout because the ends do not justify the means because if Robbinhood was successful and became the main way for people to buy and hold bitcoin then Bitcoin will have failed. This is not about making money its about retaining the wealth the little guys work so hard to earn. True believers understand this. Its about sovereignty, control, its about giving power back to the people. Its not about whats the most convenient way to move money; if you want something convenient use a VISA card. If you want to use something thats revolutionary then download a fucking wallet and become your own bank. Unless you hold the keys you don't own the bitcoin. Telling anyone otherwise is just contributing to their enslavement.

High Bitcoin ATM fees are the largest barrier to wider Bitcoin adoption. Most Bitcoin ATMs are selling bitcoins with a 20 to 30 percent fee. PBS did a segment the other day on Bitcoin and a reporter put 20 dollars into a Bitcoin-ATM and only got 13 dollars worth of Bitcoin. This is a PR nightmare in the making. We should not be defending this behavior with free market arguments we should be boycotting these ATM operators. Link:

Four to seven percent of the net worth of any nation that uses USD is stolen every year by the FED through inflation. It's taxation without representation it goes against everything the United states was meant to represent. Did you know 13 percent of adult black men or 4 percent of all Americans can't vote. And even if you can vote your options are limited if you want your vote to matter, you can vote for the stupid party or the asshole party. Give me direct democracy give me real choices.

You did the right thing.  The 5 ATM,s in my area are all scams. Fee rates as high as 30%. In late 2010 you could sign up for an online bitcoin exchange with nothing more then a user name, e-mail address and a bank  account number and buy thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin at a flat rate, the fees were around 2 to 4 bucks per transaction.

The plan is that after mining stops the network will be supported by transaction fees alone. However counter to popular belief the cap of 21 million could be raised threw consensus.  Right now the vast majority 99% of users don't want an inflation rate but again it could be raised if the network was ever co-opted or if the user base change their minds. It would be highly unlikely but it could still happen.  This one percent of the community support an inflation rate of one to two percent to ensure the mining community is healthy and immune to attack. They believe it would also help stabilize the price. I personally would support a 0.01% inflation rate.

Whomever attempts to fork Bitcoin first will likely lose. The suites, the bankers, the venture capitalists will never understand what makes Bitcoin great nor do they need to. They don't need Bitcoin to function well as a currency for them its a plaything, a giant circle jerk, the VC money continues to pour into the exchanges completely eclipsing the money real users have in the markets. The Miners control 70% of the hashing power and manufacturing and now they have convinced the investment bankers they are in control of development (because largely they are and have been for years) this UASF may have even been their idea. Most Bitcoins now rest in the hands of VC firms and suites like the Winklevoss twins. People like this want the bankers in control. They have the money to spin up as many full nodes as they need when the time comes... I wouldn't be surprised if 80% of the full-nodes running today weren't under the control of the ming farms already. They would nut in their pants if the network forked into two distinct coins/networks because they have enough money to pick a winner and come out on top every time. Even if we changed the POW to something else they have the capital and manufacturing capability to crush any hopes or dreams you may still hold. But cheer up, before the network crashes under its own bloat it will grow in value to astronomical levels. They will turn Bitcoin into the greatest ponzi scheme the world has ever seen.

Transactions spike around large market moves or news coverage. A large rally or fall in value cause people to panic sell or buy. When the transaction volume spikes predicting the necessary fee becomes harder so to prevent stuck transactions people overpay to insure a faster transaction. This leads to temporarily higher fees in a relatively small memepool. In short people overreact. I assume thats what you were asking... I mean you do know how bitcoin works right?

Yes you can send and receive bitcoins from hardware wallets but they work in unison with software outside of the device. You have to plug them into a PC and install software to use them. And they cost a lot. The vast majority of Bitcoin users love "hardware wallets" I don't. They can be hacked, they can be back-doored. I personally believe the only thing you buy when you purchase a hardware wallet is a false sense of security. But I"m the one guy in a hundred who thinks they are garbage.  Now having said that their are many types of wallets. They do not all store Bitcoins in the same way. Some wallets can be recovered from a list of "seed words" this is very convenient if you lose your wallet but again I'm that one guy in a hundred who think seed words are a bad idea. (for reasons I won't get into) If you have a good computer with a good internet connection and large hard drive you can run a full node client developed by Bitcoin's core developers that can be downloaded from the Bitcoin.org website. Or you can install an app on your smart phone. All of these wallets let you send and receive bitcoins. Some smart phone wallets let you send and receive many deferent kinds of crypto currencies. Some have features others don't. some are more secure.

Bitcoin-XT, Bitcoin-Unlimited, Bitcoin-Classic, BTC1, now Bitcoin-Cash this won't stop them. Even now they are trying to take credit for the User activated soft fork movement.

This is the only way to prevent large companies from practicing fractional reserve banking with our coins! Not your keys not your Bitcoins!

 You want to know how to receive Bitcoin to your Coinbase account correct? I have not been on coinbase in 6 months so I forget exactly how to do it but their should be a tab for deposits and under that crypto currency and under that bitcoin. Their should be a button to generate a receiving address or deposit address. Click the button for Bitcoin copy and paste it into an email to your father and ask him to send a small amount to test it. Then once you see it deposited into your Coinbase account ask him to send the rest. Edit: you can reuse this address as many times as you like it will never expire. Or you can generate a new address for each transaction. but the old address will still work and again will never expire.

I'm sorry but that shit is ugly.

Trump wants to "print money" to lower his personal debt he doesn't give a shit about the US debt. This is why Bitcoin is needed.

Cryto markets are shallow and volatile and using bitcoin to bypass tariffs is illegal. The stock market is in turmoil because its been pumped up by the FED for years. It's a bubble and it will pop.

Wow so many down votes I must have struck a nerve.

You people really have no idea how this shit works do you?
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:27:49
Good! Edit: It is often reported that governments and central banks have for years leased or sold their gold to bullion banks who in turn lease it or sell it in the retail markets. The same thing would happen with Bitcoin. They want to create a new massive market for Bitcoin obligations. They want to sell Bitcoin IOU's!

NASA hasn't even had the ability to put a man in orbit for like 10 years. How the fuck do you think they are going to put one on the moon?

I could not agree more; I only use bitcoin as a long term savings account right now but if it ever became stable I would be happy to use LN to buy coffee and take out.

Ripple not even decentralized its worse then a shit coin; the creators could flip a switch and shut down the whole network if they wanted to.

I think now would be a great time for everyone to go and send an e-mail to Mr. Sherman and tell him how you really feel about his views and comments on bitcoin its users and how we feel about the US dollar and its historical missuses.

I feel you man I really do... but your chances of losing your coins are higher if you store them on a exchange long term. You don't have to buy a whole new PC just an extra hard-drive to install an OS on. Only install the software you need to run a Bitcoin client, encryption software and security software, you can switch the hard-drive out when you want to send/receive coins. I think you can even buy a SATA cable with a built-in flip-flop switch so you can swap hard-drives without unplugging anything. Encrypt then backup your wallet on USB sticks (memory sticks) CDs Even online as long as its encrypted. Rename your files and hide them in a porn folder/cooking recipes from Grandma. As long as you don't click any suspicious links in e-mails or download any shady programs you should be fine. Their are some scary exploits out there that have not been patched an may never be for existing hardware (like row-hammer) but the best hacker groups have historically targeted exchanges; unless your a multi-millionaire with a heavy online foot-print they won't find you. I heard about a guy who encrypted his keys and hid them inside a HD image of the moon and hung it on the wall, hiding them in plain sight.

Its a common practice for coinbase to shut down when there is a flash sell/panic.

Human nature. People panic when shit breaks. Have you ever had a stuck transaction and didn't know what to do? The result is panic.
