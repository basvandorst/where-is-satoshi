I go to the university of South Carolina and was at college game day this morning. I then noticed the bitcoin sign with the reddit alien and a bitcoin logo and decided to take a [picture]( Afterwards when I was leaving, I talked to the student with the sign. He said that he camped out over night to be the second one in line. He said the reason he did this was to hopefully be able to fund a ski trip with his friend using bitcoin. Once they opened up the pit (directly behind the stage), he said he was dead center. ESPN then took his first sign he said because it violated college game day terms (no .coms) so thats why the signs are [different]( He then said he left to go home and lost his front row spot just to make a better one. Also he stated he was walking around all morning trying to explain the concept of digital currency and reddit to everyone. Well done fellow redditor!
