It weights heavy on the heart to know society conditioned us to feel like success is weighed in financial gains. As much as the bitcoin community jokes about lambos, reality is we should all be proud of what the original intent is. Freedom from systematic power.  No doubt I have seen this comminity shine on principles and while many talk about the "disruption", the real reason cryptocurrency has value is because we are part of something greater for humanity as a whole and encourage everyone to share the bigger picture more than just the "gains" from doging FOMO.

As much as I feel like a heretic for saying this, the next success should be focused on business transactions and less on HODL.  We should all move on promoting an easy, inclusive method for exchanging our funds.  Be it, a openbazzar without the set up hurdles or a well known social media campaign for goods and services that benefit the first timers and less the HODLers.

Sound logic considering the coverage it has been receiving. Ultimately the goal of bitcoin is to decentralize control and that is going to piss a lot of people off if it happens too fast. As much as I hate to say it, success will come from those in power being OK with moving to this system without loss and I think slowing down from HODL to exchanging might be the best next step. Incremental growth from here on out based on a global goods and services will do more good than purchasing for speculative gains.

thats what you think. because you are educated on crypto and its background/history. Its hard enough explaining a coin fork to the lay person, much more explaining bitcoin.com isnt bitcoin and that there are forks of bitcoin that arent bitcoin and wallets, exchanges, cold storage, etc...

headlines across big media will take advantage of this. “Bitcoin.com sued over fraud accusations”.  What do you think non crypto people will take from this?
