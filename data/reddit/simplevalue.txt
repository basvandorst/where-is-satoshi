For "2)" I understand that BTC can be broken up into smaller and smaller units. That would be interesting to see how it plays out. Who would declare this? Or would it be the industry as a whole demanding it?

And how would LiteCoin enter into that argument?

Can you elaborate because I'm not seeing how this makes sense. You're essentially saying the inflation of the fiat currency will increase the price of BTC, but the price of BTC is only valuable relative to that particular fiat currency.

So they can exchange these currencies for BTC? Correct?

That's correct, miners currently get paid in coins + fees. Once coins are all mined, they would get just fees. Would be interesting to see if people pull out because of the lack of incentive (coins) to continue mining. Will fees be enough to keep a large pool of miners? Or just a select group will remain? Who knows.

Can you elaborate on that please? What do you mean by constrained block size and what's the correlation of that with fees?

I just can't see this kind of system being easily implemented.

Do you still need it? If so, here is the link to a epub of it:

So there would be a wide conversion in the metric system used for paying things. I am trying to imagine someone going grocery shopping and trying to figure out if this item (let's say eggs) is worth .02BTC or if they should wait for a sale or something of the sorts.

But if the block reward goes to zero, why would someone mine it?

That's what I am thinking. There would either have to be 1) a mass devaluation of the fiat currency or 2) a mass conversion of that fiat currency to BTC.
