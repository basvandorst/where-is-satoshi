Hey, gotta dream big. Our dreams are what become reality, if we try to make it so.
Determine your truth by how you live your life. You don't have to believe me, but I'm going to at least try to create that world where we have each others' backs.
As with many investors, such as Peter Schiff, they say bitcoin isn't a thing because it isn't a thing. You're saying this doesn't exist because it doesn't exist. Well, then let's make it exist. We are not victims. We create the reality in which we live, if we try.

That's why I posted this. The ecosystem is designed to leverage human greed, but what will allow it to survive is community. Otherwise, it will turn into just another failed gift.
I'm not saying that most people in the space aren't in it for the money; that's just going to happen, but they're not the ones that are going to move the space forward. They will use it, but unless they start to believe in it, they will not build upon it (other than increasing the network effect).
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:48:33
Don't get me wrong, I agree with what you're saying. But my point is, underlying it all needs to be the thing that matters most, why we do any of this to begin with. That's to make the world a better place.
To make the world a better place purely for yourself (which some people are trying to indicate through their comments) is hedonistic and pointless. It will yield no real long-term happiness, as you will have no one with whom you can connect, and human connection is where one is truly rich, or poor.

Friend, btc is still a baby. It's not about killing btc, but swindling people (newbs) and therefore delaying btc's growth.
Btc can't really ever die, but we can see and call out nonsense when it occurs. The community IS WHAT ALLOWS btc to outcompete BCH. Without belief in the underlying principles of decentralization, btc would indeed have little value, but the community understands why it is so important.

Just keep doing your thing, and giving good advice to people. If they lose a lot of money, help them get through the painful education of investing too flippantly.

If you want to earn more than 19,000/year, get a better job, become an entrepreneur, come to the United States. Don't be angry and resentful. Don't be worthless. Fight for things in which you believe, no matter what obstacles are put in your way.
Fuck the obstacles. Live your life in such a way that, even if you do not accomplish what you set out to accomplish, at the end of your life, you can say you never gave up. You can die happy, with no regrets.
Have love in your life. Have purpose. Those who are without love are dead. And those who believe in nothing will fall for anything. We were not meant to work 9-5 jobs, under the thumb of some nondescript boss in some nondescript job with nondescript direction. We were meant for more than this.
Live your life, however you desire to live it. Just LIVE it! Do no harm, help people wherever you can. Be the example that others will follow, even if you fail.
To answer your question, it's not fair. But you can and will win, so long as you don't give up.

It's unrealistic to assume that a trustee would be so sophisticated in such a highly technical field. Usually they are investment management generalists.
It is more realistic to assume they would go through a publicly known, and large exchange.
Additionally, do not assume you can discern the average reason a person would downvote a post. I know from past experience, with extreme vitriol, why most people downvote posts.
It is extremely difficult to attain an upvote when everyone is unhappy, for this reason.

Depends on how old you guys are, I suppose. If you're old farts, probably best to invest in an annuity. If you're youngin's, have at it and dump whatever you're willing to lose into the bitcoins.

Not smarter than you, but this was when Tether shot up to $1.10. The value of bitcoin was tied to the value of Tether. Probably what happened was OKEX bought up a bunch of Tether to pump bitcoin, so that they could pay off their 460 million USD losing bet on a long.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:48:43
Price would go up to about $25000 based upon a $62 increase from a $25 million USD buy on Coinbase a while back. Exponential increase in price though.
That price would be more around 450-500k USD if 1/10 of the world invested $100 USD.

One of the most sound pieces of advice you can get as a baby crypto owner is to dollar-cost-average only what you are willing to lose.
If you're prone to being a nervous wreck/neurotic, just set the buys to automatic (maybe on Coinbase, but don't keep it there), and forget about it for a few weeks/months/years, etc.
Spikes and dips are normal; the market is STILL fledgling, with only about 0.3-0.4% of the entire globe's population owning any. If you want to inoculate yourself to the pains of a dip, prepare yourself to sweat, hodl on tight, and DON'T ignore bitcoin when it's dipping dramatically. If you don't think you can handle that kind of a shock just yet, don't watch it.
It's all about making yourself a stronger investor, making your stomach out of steel. This is not an easy task, even for the most experienced individuals.

If you can consider it "play" money, go ahead and get into it now. If you need the money for important things like food and rent, do not use it. Basic advice to live by.

Yep. He holds a shipton of coins... And probably wants to destroy the ecosystem. Bitcoin Unlimited is an unmitigated disaster. SegWit isn't as bad, but it's not a long-term solution. Lightning Network is the way forward, HOWEVER, SegWit can work in conjunction with it, so long as we're not constantly bumping up against the transaction block size limit.
I don't know what Ver is doing, but I have to assume that he is not helping. He does not feel right, and the community knows it. There's something amiss in him.

The infrastructure and/(of belief) underlying bitcoin at this juncture has made it incredibly robust compared to what it was back in 2013. Many people who understood how important it was to slowly suck power away from the parasitic central banking system of the world, desperately ran towards it.
There were two barriers that needed to be overcome at first: (1) you had to know that bitcoin existed, and (2) you had to spend enough time thinking about it/be smart enough to understand the ramifications of its principles. This is why the very first users (and most users today) were hyper-genius-level people (I'm talking like IQ 160+). Now, a much larger number of people at least know about it, so the threshold of understanding is decreasing IN ADDITION to the interfaces and accessibility becoming more user-friendly every day.
You don't have to be a genius to figure out how beautiful the idea of bitcoin is, but you do have to figure out how to believe in it. That is why people tend to be called "bitcoin evangelists" when they speak of the principles, because it's equivalent to how people speak about God.
Frankly, if bitcoin is to succeed, it must glorify humanity and encourage our freedom. So, it must consequently glorify God. The parallels are undeniable, and people fear speaking of them directly. I fully understand this.
The elegance of the bitcoin protocol was so mind-blowing to me when I finally grasped it that I was nearly in tears. It was as if someone came from 600 years in the future and said, "HERE! TAKE IT!" Like the internet, it was as if it were a gift from God.
I know, I sound crazy, and I know that the market is still subject to gigantic perturbations with its incredibly tiny market cap, but I believe in the idea and will always support it.

Well the Lightning Network on its own will drastically reduce the revenue of the miners (a dangerous proposition), albeit slowly. The SegWit network on its own will just kick the can down the road and cause market instability. But TOGETHER, the system will become unstoppable.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:06:24
If Bitcoin Unlimited is activated and the size of each block is drastically increased, it will eventually become unfeasible for the average person to run a node due to the blockchain size.
This is yet another reason why BU is so very, very dangerous (hypothetical block sizes even achieving Visa's transaction volume are upwards of 8GB--that's a large chunk of the ENTIRE blockchain's size right now).
When the time comes and we have to make a huge push to get Roger Ver and the rest of the BU lackeys out of the bitcoin ecosystem, remember this.
I have run a node before, and even at a 20GB chain, it takes days to download. I would not be able to run a node if the blockchain were north of 10 terabytes.

If you believe in the idea, you will not care about whether or not you make or lose money--though you will make money as a consequence of your belief, and your spread of that belief to others.
If you do not yet fully believe in the idea of bitcoin, please do more research, ask more questions, build that foundation. That foundation is the foundation of the entire market, the infrastructure that gives any of this currency its value. Without belief, we can build nothing. With belief, we can never fail.
Believe in it... Or not. But if you want to learn, education is never a detriment.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:25:09
When you have a personal relationship with the person with whom you are transacting, and/or the transaction is small and relatively unimportant, it does not need to be recorded directly upon the ledger. It WILL be recorded in the Lightning Network bundles, but you have to have a need/reason to go back and unpackage those bundles to see your transaction.
Great post, man. I totally agree. Lightning Network is the way forward, but it should be combined with SegWit.

I quite like the idea of SegWit combined with Lightning Network. With Lightning Network (if the malleability issue can be rectified), SegWit isn't really necessary, but it will make the protocol more robust for later. Lightning Network is the way forward.

Not a private network, but a "soft-fork" topology in order to rectify the block size problem by bundling many millions of transactions together, allowing the blockchain to record only the start state and the end state of each bundle, potentially compressing the number of transactions the blockchain needs to handle by a million times or more.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:22:38

It is important to note that, even with the proposed increase on the block size limit, we would only see around a 32x increase in capacity. If bitcoin is to reach the transaction volume of say, Visa, it would need to increase the size of each block to 8 GB. At least currently, that is FAR from sustainable and will centralize the network to where only a few very large mining companies can cost-effectively mine.
SegWit without Lightning Network is a very dangerous proposition.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:39:36
Yep, sound points. It's like people saying that inflation is a good thing. It is on the face of it, flat out wrong (to your point on volatility being a good thing)!
Now, mind you, inflation is built in to gold, silver, platinum, bitcoin, and anything that can be traded of value, but to say that it is inherently a good thing is utterly ridiculous. Inflation reduces the value of whatever good you own that is being inflated, making you less wealthy. Sure, it might provide some liquidity, but when it is centrally executed, those central authorities become the sole arbiters of where that good goes.

I love Peter Schiff as his intent for the most part is good (he's indeed biased because he owns lots of gold and gold-trading companies, but it's a more or less good bias), but he's being very stubborn/inflexible.
His criticism is tempering bitcoin from growing too fast (for instance, overheating before the scaling debate can be resolved!), so I appreciate it one way or another, but eventually he will have to come over when he sees bitcoin not dying.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:15:37
He is indeed not someone that can be trusted, and while he might be playing Devil's Advocate, he does not know it. That's why he is silent when he leads lambs to the slaughter; he genuinely thinks it's a good thing to destroy the burgeoning ecosystem.
Look at his history, both in bitcoin and in his personal life. What do you find? What I have found thus far is unsettling to say the least.
This community has an incredible level of discernment. I know a lot of you will say things like, "well duh! It's obvious! Look at what this jerk has done!" But frankly, if this were the general public, many would swoon over him simply by virtue of his somewhat above average physical appearance, or his way with words.
There might be a certain sociopathy about him that is indiscernible to most; above average appearance does tend to have a correlation to sociopathy... Something to think about.
The worst thing about it though, is that he genuinely thinks he's leading people in the right direction. He most certainly is not. Anything that takes away individual liberty (and his attempt to destroy bitcoin, something that builds individual liberty, is by definition taking away individual liberty) is evil. Anything that grants human beings their freedom is good.
I guess the underlying question here is, where do you stand? Clearly, if you followed the principles of bitcoin it is because you believed in liberty. If you got into the ecosystem simply to become rich, then the jury's still out on you. I get the impression Ver is the latter.

1700 in 10 days to 2 weeks, with a peak of around 2500 to 3000 by June. Many small dips in the middle, with an accelerated average daily growth rate, going from 0.265% and increasing up to around 0.5% as more people will have access to bitcoin.
Then, by the end of the year, the price will be around 3700 to 5000, I think. These are just thoughts based upon the emotional state of the bitcoin community. I have minimal evidence to back it. Just thoughts.

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:41:26
Yea, it does seem so due to malleability issues if memory serves. But if Lightning Network can get the malleability issue taken care of on it's own, SegWit wouldn't be totally required.
I can see the benefit to SegWit, but we have to be careful with it. Lightning Network NEEDS to get implemented, otherwise SegWit will not solve the problem.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:04:10
SegWit increases the capacity (maximum size) of each block in the blockchain, but what comes with that is solutions to the malleability problem with bitcoins cryptography (I don't know how they solve it precisely, but apparently it does). If SegWit is implemented when we reach the maximum block size (currently 1MB) then a bottleneck will be created, causing skyrocketing transaction fees and confirmation times. Every time the SegWit update would increase the block size, the transaction times and fees would reduce drastically, causing the miner community to get dizzy keeping up with the reduction in revenue, eventually kicking at least 10% (someone else's number) of all miners out of the mining market (a dangerous proposition)--I think it would be more than 10% myself, but that's a discussion for later.
The philosophical underpinnings of the Lightning Network are basically that you do not need to know about someone's transaction unless they are proven through their history (shown well in the blockchain) to be potential bad actors. Basically what the Lightning Network does is it "archives" trusted people's transactions, and they can be reviewed later if necessary, if you put pressure on the system and its participants to do so. It's something akin to a "need-to-know" for secret clearances in the military, or the Prime Directive for extraterrestrials in space.
The philosophical underpinnings are sound, and we CAN trust people who have proven themselves through their history, but we are not REQUIRED to trust anyone.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:44:01

@_date: 2017-03-03 23:00:52
Without free will, there is no requirement for trust. Therefore, the protocol can act as a perfect "third party" to mitigate transactions as it wants nothing in return.

The USD, which is the most widely-used currency in the world, is only 1/3300th the value of a bitcoin. Gold is only worth 1/3 of a bitcoin for an ounce. Silver, platinum, etc... Across the board.
It IS the most valuable currency across the globe. More people just need to use it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:19:41
Yes! Please do!
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:22:00
Why the hell did you do that?!
No!! Invest only what you don't mind losing. Bitcoin is still a baby and thus subject to gigantic price fluctuations. The long term is up, but you're now going to get some ulcers along the way. I hope this is a fake post.

Always so intrigued with how incredibly intelligent the majority of bitcoin users are. Fantastic points!
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:52:16
Tactics over strategy. The way we fight the bankers is we keep the protocol and ecosystem working well, to meet the demands of the public BETTER than the banks, a way that's easier for the average consumer to use than simply subjugating themselves to fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:47:55

And THIS is what the builder does... in fiat, with 2% inflation sucking away the entire bottom line/stash building, no real building can take place. This is the currency Trojan Horse that will annihilate that den of vipers and thieves we know as the federal reserve for good... so long as we keep on pushing back against their resistance, and pushing hard!

Heck yea man! It's been invigorating so far. Every fall makes one stronger, more momentum for every rise.
Bitcoin is not really the protocol or the currency: it is the people, the community. WE are getting stronger with every blow. And soon, we will be unstoppable.

Somebody had once meant to type, "this is it, gentlemen." Typed it as "this is gentlemen," and people ran with it. Much like HODL instead of hold.
People type "This!" when they're too lazy/tired to type that they concur with someone else's comments earlier in a thread. "This is," is me just being silly :-)

I've gotten about a dozen people onboard from work myself :-)
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:14:25
I appreciate the stance they have taken so far, but let's let the market sort it out and see if BCH actually has any value.
If nothing else, the social capital that Jihan Wu has squandered is worth noting. No one will want to back the currency purely based upon his dick personality.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:45:47
We're about to get a big lesson in what liquidity actually means.
The only reason BCH's price is anywhere near its current level is because there is no liquidity (that means, there are no bitcoin cash units changing hands and thus causing network effect).
Once that happens, it will be a dramatic shock to the system that will likely completely destroy the new currency.
It's hard to determine peoples'/companies intent, especially when they are shady in their endeavors. Do not assume that those refusing to transact in BCH have good intentions (may be trying to artificially increase the price so that they can cash out), and don't assume those transacting in BCH have sold out...
What matters is the underlying principles of the respective currencies. If BCH has any inherent value (such as decentralization, deflationary properties, scaling, etc.), then it will survive. If it does not, it will not.
Let the market sort it out. Don't vest any of your energy in the trust of other individuals and their intent. That goes against the foundations of why bitcoin was created to begin with.
Just wait and see. Once people are actually given the chance to sell their BCH, let's see where the price goes... In the short term, and in the long term.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:14:41

No we need to keep whining because it draws attention to it. When we do that, we'll work harder to remedy the situation. 
I'll suppose I'll say, don't whine, but do bring up the grievance in a flamboyant way so people will pay attention... even if you're ridiculed.

@_date: 2017-08-26 16:32:26
Also, don't sell all at once. Sell little bits to multiple people/entities to keep people off your back. You don't need that much money immediately anyway. Live a humble life, as if you don't even have that money. This will reduce anxiety and prevent you from doing something foolish with the funds.
You could cash in a few thousand dollars at a time, and do that every month for a spectacular income supplement.

"The largest cause of non-spam transactions seems to be companies who designed their infrastructure assuming transactions are cheap. The big VC-backed ones know making their operations more efficient won’t increase their valuations, but expanding their business will. Their pain threshold is clearly higher than the recent fees."
This means that The Lightning Network will work wonders!
Nevertheless, this man brings up points that we are underestimating. Scaling is insanely important.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:51:46
I do understand your point. That's what SegWit/Lightning Network are for.

I'm not interested in calling these types of posts FUD when they're so well thought out. Don't forget: resistance builds muscle. Answers to all potential attack vectors must be posited, and as you all should know very well by this point, there is virtue in repetition.

Exactly. Too many trolls here filled with resentment..
I can understand many of the thinkers on this forum get beaten down a lot, and some of them even begin to spew vitriol themselves, but it doesn't make it any better.
We're part of a very small community, still very much pioneers in the space. We have to have each others' backs. This means giving criticism that is constructive when needed, and supporting genuinely good ideas and be grateful for each others' help. This guy is making everyone feel shittier, helping no one.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:20:44
No, I do understand, believe me. I do. But, DCA is the typical answer to mitigate extreme risk. Just put in what you're willing to lose.

I agree that we need not have them convert it immediately back into fiat, though there is a place for that. It still adds liquidity.
But, mind you, many millions of people use USD, but only a few really understand the underpinnings of it. Not everyone has to really understand it. It just needs to be used... Most people are followers.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:05:55
I love that you posted this haha!! XD

Arguments can either be logical or empirical. I produced logical arguments.
If some moderator took my post down, there's more to talk about. There is no argument one has produced to do so. Who cares that I said "devil," or anything like that. If that word bothers people, then they are falling into the camp that I present: the resentful. That word is a concept.
Look at the philosophical arguments, friend.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:03:44
A very good idea that many bitcoin entrepreneurs and evangelists advocate. I do myself.

Yea... People into bitcoin know a lot of stuffz. Space is fun.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:35:29
It is a good idea for the bitcoin community to also encourage them to think about holding on to at least a small portion of the bitcoin they are getting.
Though it is still a net positive, as it is adding liquidity to the market.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:30:56
So if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about...

I totally agree with that, but that's what SegWit is for. Lightning Network will allow massive increases in transaction volume, which will then open the door for Amazon.

I would say that the overwhelming majority of people who are really into bitcoin and knowledgeable enough to contribute to such a subreddit are still far above average intelligence and understanding... But I do understand your point.
Truly intelligent arguments often times get voted down purely out of resentment/people being on power trips and wanting to keep others down. Doesn't happen all the time, but happens more often than I think most of us would like to admit.

We must keep working though! We have to stay in front of/outpace the evil people trying to control us. Don't get lazy! This rise is awesome, but it has only gotten this far because of hard-working people that never gave up on the idea. Next hurdle is to get segwit fully activated then LN.

But you forgot about you, bud. You're a scarce resource. There's only one you, and that goes for everyone here.
Invest in yourself, and in each other. Build strong relationships and community, and it will make bitcoin all the more worth it. Because why do we want to get out from under the yoke of the banks? To make the world a better place for ourselves, and each other.
YOU are the most valuable resource, irreplaceable, completely unique. Treat yourself, and everyone else, like it.

Nah, don't worry, we are still quite united. It's just that the trolls tend to be the loudest people around here. C'est la vie. It's really the way it works anywhere. Squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Now, mind you, I will say worry so that we don't lose the small stronghold of community that we are starting to build, but at the same time, don't be too disheartened. This is just a tough spot. Don't know how long it will last, don't know how far down it will go, but we'll get through it. It will likely test your endurance though.

I did something similar and bought a lump early at 7600. It's okay. Bear market right now. No telling how long it will last, no telling where the tops and bottoms are. All we can do is spread word, wait, keep buying, find ways to build community and improve the technology. There are many things we can control, but the price is not one of them.

I know what I hope, I know what I believe, but I cannot predict the price of bitcoin. The price is still too low, as is the liquidity, to really get an estimate of its true value with any reasonable level of fidelity.
That is, one person with 100 million USD (or entity) can suddenly decide to buy that much worth in a day or a few, and cause the price to skyrocket a thousand dollars.
There just aren't enough people in bitcoin yet, and that's because the technology is very complicated, way too complicated for the average consumer to understand yet. Frankly, it's even too complicated for most sophisticated investors to really have a clue about it.
If the sophisticated investors really understood what bitcoin was, most would be in tears, or on the verge of them.

The title of this thread is not well-written. I was saying that bitcoin is indeed the underdog. The way it is written, "Bitcoin is 'not for me' but it's too 'arrogant' to say it won't have a future." It should be written for clarity: "Bitcoin is 'not for me' but Goldman Sachs CEO is too 'arrogant' to say it won't have a future."
The wording is jumbled.

It's because very powerful interests (that is, those with a lot of USD) want centralization.

If this were to ever happen in real life, just give the money back. You can ask for a reward, but give the money back.

It appears that, aside from the code being cleaned up and made as perfect as possible, the faster we get every transaction SegWit enabled, the faster Lightning Network can be implemented. As it stands, if the Lightning Network has any non-SegWit addresses exposed to payment channels, transaction malleability is introduced, which can compromise the channel's stability and potentially render useless the entire channel.
So, start a SegWit-enabled node, and that will help drastically.

Not FUD my friend. I'm trying to address an issue that is very dangerous. Look at their prices.

Damn, man, I'm sorry. Either way, you need to strengthen your belief in the bitcoin protocol/ecosystem if you want to prevent yourself from selling again when it drastically dips.
It really is all about belief, even if the mostly atheistic community around here shirks away from the concept. Belief is what gives fiat value, it's what gives gold value... And it's what gives bitcoin its value.
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:33:05
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:27:46
To your title: because institutional investors are starting to get into bitcoin now, and they still listen to people like the JP Morgan CEO. They think this bitcoin thing is just a way to make a quick buck, but it is MEANT to undermine JP Morgan and the big banks. It won't take them out all at once, but slowly. It will compete in the marketplace for a while with banks, and then the banks will finally realize... Eh, who am I kidding? They're too arrogant to realize, that centralization cannot compete with true money like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:25:41

@_date: 2017-09-13 14:56:55
Perhaps the dramatic part is my desire to hearken back to belief. Belief really is what gets bitcoin to have its value, just like any currency--from fiat to gold.
And I do agree with you, but if we stop assuming the possibility, however remote, that bitcoin could die, then it will. That doubt is what keeps bitcoin going, because it makes us work harder.
I think 10k by the end of this year, btw ;-)

Letting them know that you were right has its place, but be careful about making yourself excessively self-important. That is, you may humble them by showing them the fruits of your faith in the protocol, but if you make it about you instead of about freeing human society, it will fall flat on its face and yield no positive result.

No doubt that's something that can happen. Just stand back, be patient, and buy when the stampede has passed, or sell if you want.

It should have still inflated the dollar, because that was value that was divested from other individuals and institutions, without consent, without a legitimate tax.
While they didn't enter the market normally, that's pretty much my point. They can do the same thing with a burgeoning market like bitcoin if they really wanted to... And with the hype surrounding bitcoin lately, they would most definitely want to.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:47:35
If he can hold on for just a little while...
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:32:24

When I read posts like this, it is a very good sign. Bitcoin for the future.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:30:38
It does, and that is a very smart path IMHO. Look at the size of this subreddit. There are nearly 320k people here, and I'd assume at least 20% of them have a good chunk of bitcoin. Assuming that, this sub has at least $256 million in bitcoin value here alone (assuming 1 bitcoin owned on average by 20% of the subreddit's subscribers).
Bitcoin is growing massively right now, and it will only continue. Numbers like the size of this subreddit are good indicators, since there's no real way at the moment to tell how many people actually own bitcoin. I would assume the number is around 12 million individuals with at least 0.1 bitcoin (about 0.001% market saturation from what I've heard, when we're all shooting for 10 to 100% if we keep pushing). Numbers that may back up this claim are the number of coinbase users (over 10 million wallets, which probably equates to roughly 6 million users), number of regular exchange users on gemini and the like, and institutional investors. There's also a very large number of people who genuinely do work the dark web and keep themselves anonymous. I have a friend here where I live that nearly had his bitcoin stolen (he had 8 separate empty wallets that were dummies in case such a thing happened), so he completely disappeared after that, went off the radar. I would surmise that there are many people that live that way in the bitcoin community nowadays.
All that said, it is clear that bitcoin is still a baby (if that--probably more like a fetus). All we need to do is hold on and keep spreading it through word of mouth.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:45:30

Nah man, don't cash out. But if you're playing the market and trying to semi-day trade, then you should have sold a bit at 5000, a bit at 4300, and then re-bought near this price. You may have another $200 of dip to make a profit in that modality, but you would be well-advised holding right now I think.

Ah, gotcha. You have good points, for sure. The regulatory tapeworm in this case could be used to bitcoin's advantage, I suppose... But in the grand scheme of things, likely not. Regulatory capture is a real thing, and gigantic companies can use regulation as leverage rather than a means by which the government can genuinely "level the playing field."
I would like to think we have nothing to be angry at the banks about, but I will always be against central banking... And the ability to print up endless amounts of fiat quietly and then use that fiat that no one even knows exists (therefore it won't be priced into the market via inflation) can allow for institutions like JP Morgan to maintain a stranglehold on a nascent ecosystem such as bitcoin's.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:37:37
This is a toughie. It may actually be smart to hodl on to both coins in this case, as opposed to the genuinely negative BCH. SegWit2x seemed to actually have good intent behind it (a compromise to open up the door for people to find common ground in other fields), and MAY prove to work in the future.
If SegWit2x yields a coin split, I MAY be so inclined as to hodl those new coins. We shall see. It is still bitcoin, both branches will genuinely be bitcoin (therefore it won't muddie crypto history), just different versions.

99.999% of them are shit, as Andreas Antanopolis says. I concur. It is because so many of them come from the desire to make money and not actually produce anything of value (which requires belief).

This ones my favorite ��
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:48:15
We're right about at the percentage loss of the last dip (from 2900 to 1900). Now past trends are not a guarantee of future trends, but they are good indicators.
I don't see this going much farther down than 3600 (just my HO).

Nah, I think it's very good to allow meme magic to speak to the emotions of the user base, especially if they're with good intent/in good spirit.
Lots of meme magic, but also some pretty decent quality posts here.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:38:10
Everything you stated with regards to minimal user base at the moment leading to low liquidity, high volatility, and rendering it mostly unusable as an M1 currency are being worked on. The only way to increase use is to spread the word and keep working on the code+strengthen the community of users that already exists. All these things are being done. Just be patient, stay vigilant, and keep working. Bitcoin's price has in 8 years gone from 6 cents to over 5000 dollars, and it is STILL a fetus. This might give a bit of perspective:

THAT is smart investment strategy. And even if this experiment fails, we can have our investments die knowing that we put our money into something in which we believed.

Eh, you start off small and build your capital over time. Don't rush it, don't worry. Just like a Roth IRA, 401k, or TSP if you're in the military, dollar-cost-averaging is the safest and smartest investment strategy to mitigate risk.

Ultimately, it's your choice. But your gut might be confused because you aren't getting all the way to the core of it. When both sides look even (this is letting evidence sway the gut, which isn't necessarily bad), make a choice based upon your gut. The gut doesn't get confused. Your mind gets confused by convolution.

This... Is actually a brilliant idea.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:07:31
Bitcoin will take all the best aspects of every other coin and implement them, so long as the underlying protocol is compatible. Just look toward litecoin as an example. It implemented SegWit, and SegWit worked. Bitcoin followed. Litecoin implemented Lightning Network, and it worked. Bitcoin will soon follow.
There will be other coins that will do things that by the nature of bitcoin's proof of work protocol, bitcoin cannot do very well, and thus those alternative coins will have a place in the end game, but bitcoin will be the one to make it to the end as a proof of work currency.
The point of alts is to act as effective test beds, and add greater utility to the blockchain with respect to things bitcoin necessarily cannot do due to tradeoffs. This is all good, and all altcoins have their place.

It should have still inflated the dollar, because that was value that was divested from other individuals and institutions, without consent, without a legitimate tax.
While they didn't enter the market normally, that's pretty much my point. They can do the same thing with a burgeoning market like bitcoin if they really wanted to... And with the hype surrounding bitcoin lately, they would most definitely want to.

So be it. Just another wave of silliness. More people get into bitcoin every day, more people learn about it every day.

You can indeed use it at a currency, with some short-term risk in volatility. Don't worry; utility for larger entities will come in time. The time scales of bitcoin's evolution seem long, but this is really a meteoric rise (very rapid!) when you think of the time scales of traditional money's existence.

With the rapidity with which this fall is occurring, it's probably just another downward Bart pattern.
I would like to figure out what's actually  causing the Bart pattern, because that's not natural. My guess is that it's some large entity with set times when they decide to short or long bitcoin. Perhaps the CME or CBOE?
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:51:46
The video explains it pretty well. Just set up your electron cash wallet, then open your bitcoin wallet in the program. There's an option in the top left menu to open other wallets. Use that; you can't go wrong.

Don't close the account because it'll hurt your credit history, but do open another bank account at another bank, fund that account (make sure it's bitcoin friendly) and start doing your bitcoin transactions there.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:41:14
Ah, gotcha. You have good points, for sure. The regulatory tapeworm in this case could be used to bitcoin's advantage, I suppose... But in the grand scheme of things, likely not. Regulatory capture is a real thing, and gigantic companies can use regulation as leverage rather than a means by which the government can genuinely "level the playing field."
I would like to think we have nothing to be angry at the banks about, but I will always be against central banking... And the ability to print up endless amounts of fiat quietly and then use that fiat that no one even knows exists (therefore it won't be priced into the market via inflation) can allow for institutions like JP Morgan to maintain a stranglehold on a nascent ecosystem such as bitcoin's.

Make a wallet, fund it with $20 worth of bitcoin, write down the private key onto a piece of paper, give that piece of paper to your cousin. He now owns the private key, and thus the bitcoins.

Indeed many will lose quite a bit in the relatively short term. I mean, only about 6 weeks ago, the price went from 3050 to 1880. The perturbations are very slowly becoming less egregious as the price very quickly increases.

@_date: 2017-10-12 17:14:40
I know the feeling, friend. Have endurance. When you have been public about being in bitcoin at 500, and then it goes to 20k, people will know that you're someone they can go to for advice on it because (1) you'll have enough money to not be interested in extorting them, and (2) you had the wisdom to invest cheap. Also (3) you probably have been educating yourself on it for a very long time.
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:10:34
When you set this up, it uses the btc key but on a BCH wallet. If you extract the BCH, it does nothing to the btc you have on your electrum wallet. So yes, you are safe. Both electrum and electron cash are highly vetted ������
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:44:32
As far as I know, it doesn't do that and will not do that. If you owned any bitcoin before BCH became a thing, then you automatically have BCH as well. I think what you might be referring to is that transferring your bitcoin to a bread wallet also gives you BCH (basically shows you that you have it), but I wouldn't know exactly. You'd have to talk to someone who is more learned on it than me.

@_date: 2017-10-27 15:16:32
Bitcoin is constantly bubbling and constantly bursting. It's just a matter of how quickly it occurs, and to what degree. The degree is lessening every day, and the velocity of those occurrences is also quickening.
Of course bitcoin can and will experience more pops, it's an asset with real value. But to say it will reach a climax where it will die is a bit of a stretch many of the skeptics speak of.

This is a perfect example of having to operate within the system in order to change it... That is, act as an infiltrator of sorts.
... Since he has a near monopoly on the production of miners, one has no choice but to transact in bitcoin cash to take away some of his mining power.
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:12:22
Not all of them.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:56:06
We are there. It's now just a variable of how long we stay in the depression/hope phase before launch. It looks like we're starting to rocket back up, but we've been faked out many times before. It could have simply been a short squeeze, though I believe the descending wedge actually has some traction as a legitimate TA instrument right now. There's not much farther we can go on the down side.
Personally, I would prefer a slow, steady growth in these coming weeks/months, but as we know, bitcoin doesn't operate like that. The market is too tiny still, so small amounts of money can cause the price to swing violently. Slow growth would scare fewer people off and ultimately expedite bitcoin's ascendancy, but we kind of just have to roll with the punches.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:08:26
Not arbitrary. Comparing it against all money? Comparing it against giant companies? Not arbitrary.

Legitimately, there may be a significant price jump after the 17th. Many large companies, and many individuals as well, are waiting for after tax day to jump in out of fear that their gains will be taxed into oblivion--even if they don't cash out of bitcoin, most people don't realize that you don't have to pay taxes on it unless you actually convert it to USD.

No, very few people on this sub own bitcoin. No, we are definitely not positive enough. So much vitriol here, we need to spread as much encouragement as possible.

It's really not, and I am not an expert. Simply by virtue of going through the ebbs and flows, having been in the space for several years, and owning some bitcoin, does not make me an expert.
Additionally, if I am manipulating people (which I'm not), it is in an effort to encourage them to exercise their free will, to have agency. You reversed it, and are projecting the very thing you are trying to do.
So, I ask, is there any soul left in you? Because this is disgraceful what you are saying. As one human being to another though, I forgive you. But don't expect your nihilism to have any hold over me.

Your discouraging mentality is absurd, not having the ability to realize that spreading misery DOES NOT HELP.

Intent is not something you can read. It bears itself through action.
Can you not see your projection?
Things you have no evidence for, yet are attacking me on:
1. Saying I have terrible intent.
2. Saying that what I want is shared pain (not the case, I am empathizing).
3. Saying I'm not helping (you can't read other people's minds, and thus do not know whether I am giving them something useful to grab on or not).
4. Saying that my posts are influencing no one. This only serves to discourage me, serves to lessen peoples' belief that their thoughts and opinions matter, and causes more good people to stay silent out of fear of constantly being attacked.
5. Saying that my post is whiney. This only serves to discourage me, and you have no proof to the claim.
6. Saying mods should remove it is once again an attempt to invalidate me, for reasons of the aforementioned criticisms for which you have not proof.
You are only hurting people with these posts. STOP IT.

It's unlikely that as public of a company as Coinbase is, that they will steal from you. Always possible though.
Just never keep your bitcoin (a significant amount, anyway) on Coinbase or any exchange/central location where you do not actually own the private key to the wallet.

A lot of people are probably telling you this, but I just want to caution you one more time: try not to tell people how much currency you have saved up so openly. While we have mostly a solid community here, there are many who would try to find you and steal your wealth, especially if/when bitcoin reaches the hundreds of thousands of USD per coin.

Well, I have ethereum as well, but what I mean by bad is that it will cause a market crash I think. Bitcoin is proof-of-work, which is what money is philosophically supposed to be. Ethereum is proof-of-stake, basically an analog to contracts, and there is a definite place for it in the ecosystem. But for it to unseat bitcoin?
I'm telling you good sir, and you may not like my words, it is not a good thing! You might hate me and shoot the messenger, but it will not help the market at all.

I think it's getting downvoted because people are feeling miserable right now. Most people tend to project their anger and frustration rather than empathize with the pains of others.
This isn't anything evil, it's just what humans usually do. Therefore, the only way to help in the situation is to encourage. Though, when you encourage in that environment, it's a minefield, and you have to be willing to take many, many blows before people show any gratitude.
There is nothing wrong with the idea I posited, but resentment and frustration closes off the mind to it when all one is trying to do is survive.
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:05:32
I totes agree, man. Let's do this!!
It's looking good for the bitcoin community right now.
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:11:50
Much of it is manipulation, I would surmise, by a few bad actors--pumping BCH to encourage greedy people to hop in and ride the wave (a wave the manipulating whales control).
I have minimal proof of this. Just a hunch. Human nature. Ah well. We've got something good going here; there will always be immoral people that try to ride on bitcoin's coattails.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:40:59
Then acquire bitcoins and spend bitcoins. It is fully possible. You can buy them from a specific person or from a good exchange if you don't want to use coinbase.
I have used bitcoin for small and large transactions several times in the last few days, and there was no more than a 10-minute wait. Mind you, the fee was somewhat larger than I would have liked, but nothing egregious ($.60 for a $30 transaction).
The scaling debate is meant to remedy your points, but if you have no bitcoin and attack the idea without providing solutions, it looks mostly like you're just stirring the crap pot.
If you want people to listen to ya, buy bitcoin. Otherwise it's just damage control to try and make sure people don't fall victim to your misleading.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:53:06
Just because something has yet to be done, does not mean it will not be done. Nor does it mean that it is impossible.
It's thoughts like this that prevent us from making progress, because what you are doing is discouraging people. You're frustrated, and spreading that frustration to other people, very selfish.
All I'm trying to do is encourage.

Even if that were true, and it's not, I'm willing to ride the ship down to the bottom because I believe in the idea... Once more, hearkening back to the point I was making in the post.
SegWit, Lightning Network, Schnorr Signatures coming up, MAST, and much more... Yea, bitcoin is NOT AOL.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:46:05
I hardly think that the value of block rewards will be close to 0. At that point in time (10-15 years in the future), it is likely that (assuming bitcoin does what we all hope!) the value of a single bitcoin will probably be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range. Halving approximately every 4 years means that we would get approximately 3 to 4 halvings. We're currently at 12.5 btc per block. So, about 1.0625 bitcoin per block would still be valued as several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Currently the value of each block's reward is in the tens of thousands!
I don't think we'll have to worry about the block reward going to nothing for at least 50 years... But I'm of the mentality that we will never really have to worry about it, because the value of bitcoin will in trend only ever go up.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:12:15
Then why are you here? You're only spreading misery.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:53:04
Okay, I will trust your word that you own bitcoin. Now I can trust that you have arguments more than simply throwing poop.
Yes, scaling is an issue. Yes, the community is working on it. Yes, there are nefarious actors out there that are trying to stall possible solutions (for better or for worse). But one way or another, even if the debate causes temporary problems and even a price crash or two, the solutions will be implemented because of the prospect of a world without gatekeepers on our personal wealth.
Now it's about trust. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:44:09
Hells yea man! :D
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:27:14
No don't get me wrong, I appreciate valid criticism, but I would hardly assume your intent is good. Prove it to me.
A person with a good intent will yield the legitimate grievance in an effort to help someone build a path to success, rather than stop progress in resentment.
How much bitcoin do you own?
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:23:13
I concur with that. And it indeed needs to be re-emphasized. There is virtue in repetition. I mean, so far only a few thousand people have even heard this argument.

Wu, you're a douche. You're aiding towards turning bitcoin into a commodity, rather than a currency as it is intended!
20% of the income of miners when miners are making money hand-over-fist at this meteoric rise in bitcoin prices? If you and your ilk don't stop this nonsense, you WILL cause the price to crash while we're trying to sort out the scaling debacle! STOP IT, JIHAN!
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:48:42
Invest only what you can afford. If you can afford the $20k, then go ahead and put it in, but if it is going to make you lose sleep at night if the price drops significantly, I highly advise against it.
The best method for both hedging against market perturbations and against personal angst (IMHO) is to dollar-cost-average. That is to say, buy a small amount of bitcoin (small enough that you won't even notice when the money is taken out of your bank account) every so often. For example, you could dollar-cost average where you buy $30 worth of bitcoin every week, and let that continue in perpetuity. That way, the amount of bitcoin you have will pile up, and the amount you are buying will always be less than what you already have (this causes an exponential increase in your asset values assuming the market continues to rise).
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:50:09
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:55:54
SegWit, then Lightning Network. I agree. Scaling must be done for bitcoin and ASAP, or it may stall significantly.
$1730 is amazing, but if we want $17,000, scaling is a necessity.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:52:35
THEN Lightning Network.

That's a good point. Still don't like how quickly ethereum is rising. I like ethereum, but it has the potential to topple the nascent history we're trying to build with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:25:47
It certainly is the real thing. Bitcoin is now accepted as legal tender in Japan.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:55:50
Now that many users understand what SegWit and the Lightning Network actually are, and understand the limitations of the current block system (thankfully, we have an incredibly intelligent hardcore user base, so this learning curve was easy to overcome!), we can actually implement a solution that will perhaps last for several decades.
Get SegWit activated now, then Lightning Network!

I feel ya man, but don't beat yourself up too much. You know that if you get in at any point, dollar-cost-average, and hodl, you will be fine. Remember, the goal is for bitcoin to BE the mode of transaction in maybe 15 to 20 years or so; things will no longer be priced in fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:53:31
The amount of bitcoin is how much skin you have in the game. That helps others discern intent. That is, whether you're just a s@ troll, or someone who genuinely wants to get something fixed.

You and me, and everyone else who believes in the idea of decentralized currency. (fixed typo)
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:05:22
If we're constantly changing the underlying protocol there is no way to build consistency or a history, and the value of the system itself is compromised.
Yes, I agree, evolution is key to success of any product/ecosystem, but disregarding the social capital built up through that history is very ill-advised. History matters, and if bitcoin is unseated, all those first-movers who believed in the idea of a decentralized currency that could kill the central banks will be stabbed in the back, and those left with small holdings in ethereum (or even large) will be the vicious and jaded, and the trust that can be built from a trustless currency system will be dramatically and perhaps irreversibly eroded.
If ethereum unseats bitcoin, I am telling you, IT IS A BAD THING.

Japan making it a new legal asset class. People are underestimating the effect this is having. Look at the total market cap of Japan's asset market and you will get an idea of where this price rise will level out. I'm thinking around $6000.

I haven't found the exact numbers on the size of this particular market, but if you do an analog to the US dollar market and the size of the US economy, there's roughly a 15:1 scale. Japan has a GDP that is roughly 1/4 that of the US. Therefore, ($1T currency-asset market)/(4 to 6), yields somewhere around $165B. However, I don't know the exact numbers, so I'm giving a very conservative estimate (I think), and saying it's no more than about $100B that will be invested into bitcoin.

This was a very helpful post, thank you! But definitely dumb it down a bit more for those who don't have the time to look into specific terms.
Man... It's strange. The amount of bitcoin that miners make off transaction fees is minimal to the amount of bitcoin they make from mining blocks themselves. They're just making a big hullabaloo about nothing and really need to stop.

They're demanding that it be codified. The more we resist now, the more robust the codification of SegWit in the future. That is to say, we won't waver at the drop of a hat; we'll be committed.

The typical wisdom on r/bitcoin is to dollar-cost-average, just as financial planners typically have you do with a roth-IRA or TSP. That is what I would recommend, but do not put more into it than you can afford to lose. Pretty simple advice that many, many people do not follow.

It wasn't about FUD. It was the Hegelian Dialectic with a good intent behind it. Problem: transaction volume has a distinct and low limit that will be extremely difficult to change due to bitcoin ossification in the future. Reaction: large movers in the ecosystem (Jihan and Ver) pay to spam the ecosystem with ridiculous transactions. Solution: enter SegWit and Lightning Network, BIP141 and BIP148 (and others).
This... Really was "Good Guy Jihan," and Devil's Advocate Ver...
While it may be very frustrating at the time, and if the good people in the community did not resist right back, the ecosystem would have hugely suffered, Jihan and Ver actually DID help... A lot.
I guess for that, at least on my end, I can forgive them. But never see them as your friends. They're supposed to be enemies.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:50:52
And it's good that we continue to think that. Always think that. I just want to keep it in the back of people's minds that there may be more happening behind the scenes than any of us really realize.

No they haven't. They depress wages, and are BREAKING THE LAW by definition. They compromise the integrity of the governmental system and create a double standard.
And not true; many people would do those jobs. It would adjust the supply-demand curve back to where it is supposed to be, and also stimulate the creation of more automation (reference "fight for 15" and automated registers at McDonald's).
Yes, they are entirely legitimate comparisons. Even if Trump's ban were broader, and it's not, he as the president has the legal right to do so, and he was voted in by the public, following all the voting/electoral college rules.
The point of the second amendment was never for hunting, never for The Frontier; it was always to allow for individuals to defend themselves against overreaching GOVERNMENT. All the other things we can defend against are niceties.
No one is being helped by Obamacare. It is giving healthcare to those who will not be grateful for it; they did not earn it and are not accountable to making it run well. The individual is accountable to make their insurance run well when they are the ones that have to foot the bill. As it is now, premiums are skyrocketing, and those who actually work are having the burden placed on their backs; the lazy are reaping the benefits, completely destroying the incentive structure that is natural to the free market.
For the kid: we have always had charity, and before the government got in the way with licensing etc. charity took care of the overwhelming majority of those problems without a hitch. If someone is genuinely sick and can't afford their medical bills, they must advertise their illness to those who desire to help, and they will receive help. Government intervention places a gun to the average citizen's head and FORCES you to pay for it, which no longer makes it charity, but thievery.

@_date: 2017-06-03 18:38:24
I don't know where you got it in your head that a UASF would lead you to lose your coins. The point of a soft fork as opposed to a hard fork is that it prevents a separate coin from being made by splitting the chain altogether. If the chain is split, then adherents to the previous code will divest from the newly created code, therefore diluting the value of your currency.
You're getting it backwards if you're attacking UASF. Everything that you said here is what would be caused by a hard fork. How in the world are people getting this sh@ mixed up?!
A HARD FORK would dilute the market, potentially causing you to lose purchasing power. A SOFT FORK would keep the very same chain, just with top-level additions to the code.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:54:45
That's exactly my point. The fees aren't too high to pay, hence optimization point. That optimization point is ever increasing in price because the user base is increasing in size. Optimization points are rarely, if ever, stationary.
SegWit and UASF are the community putting pressure on it. If that pressure isn't put on the network and community now, then this transaction fee bubble (and it is a bubble) will pop in a very painful manner.

Belief is the cornerstone of everything. Just let me know if you need anything else. I'll do what I can to help.

The trend shows bitcoin is likely to never fall below 1750 again.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:51:09
This might be a very good idea. If you care not to be concerned about the scaling debate, "set it and forget it."
But if you want to keep learning and toughen your stomach (adversity heightens our senses much more than good times, allowing us to learn more, and at a quicker pace), then just hodl on, and strap in for the ride.
Roller coasters are par for the course. Don't worry, it'll pop back up in the near future, and will stay up there in no time at all.
Remember, 8 years is an eternity in the crypto space, but is the blink of an eye when compared to scales of economies, technological advancement, and/or civilization.

For now we need not worry about transaction fees being the sole supplier of miner revenue. This was a brilliant design by Nakamoto to make the last bitcoins be mined in at least 100 years.
But there is a self-feeding negative feedback mechanism here. If the miners make fees too high, the utility of bitcoin diminishes to unusable levels. If that happens, the price depreciates significantly, and therefore their revenue falls even more than the money they're making off transaction fees. It's an optimization problem, and at the moment they have hit that optimization point.
Our job is to change the optimization point to a much lower transaction fee. It's kind of similar to Mars' atmosphere. It is currently at an equilibrium pressure, which also happens to be the triple-point of water. However, if the temperature of the surface of Mars is increased even 10 degrees Celsius, the planet achieves a new equilibrium point of 50 millibars surface pressure, at which it will stay nearly indefinitely.
Miners are optimizing their revenue in much the same way, but if the community puts pressure on them, we can "force push" that equilibrium point back to where it should be, a much more farsighted vision of bitcoin.

Always continue educating yourself on it. It is smart to be cautious. But there is a way to invest that takes care of much of the risk, and a method that most people on this forum would recommend: dollar-cost-average. Buy a little bit every two-weeks or so, until you've built up a nice nest egg.
Maybe $50 per week or so. It sounds like you're on the right track bud :-)
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:34:22
Ha! It will keep dying until everyone is begrudgingly using it :-)
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:57:31
Lol yea of course sound point. But any time you buy will be a win if you believe in the idea. That's what's allowing bitcoin to grow so much.

Dude, you've been toughened far more than most, and you're still standing. I salute you, general! :-)
I was there for the bearwhale too. That was crazy shit! You have to have nerves of steel, and an iron stomach to bear this.
Don't worry. So long as you do not lose the kernel of belief, the reason we are all here, this will work. Bitcoin has the history, and therefore all it needs to do is survive. It will because I'll never stop believing. I will tell you that right now.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:37:41
Exactly :-)
Bitcoin is hardly more than a fetus right now, yet still remains the elder statesmen of the cryptocurrencies, and the elder statesmen it will always be.
Imagine where it will be in 10 years, so long as we don't give up on the idea because of stubborn people holding back good ideas.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:23:43
I've been in bitcoin for a while my friend. It's not an emotional trade--nothing more than what I can afford.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:09:36
That wave is coming, but I don't think it's quite here yet. If we can get firm underpinnings before greed comes in, bitcoin will endure through pretty much any future storm.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:17:23
Yep, this is a legitimate reason to sue. Do it.

@_date: 2017-06-10 22:15:24
I think bigger blocks will be a good idea too, so long as it's not infinite. Bigger blocks up to a limit of maybe 8 to 32 mb per block is reasonable. That combined with compression from SegWit will be very good.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:13:08
That's exactly the point. Big companies that conduct a great many transactions per day can put their transactions into a transaction pool (lightning network bundle), then transmit it to the network once they are done for the day.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:18:34
Bitcoin is still just a fetus. Let's watch what it does when it's truly given space to thrive.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:32:38
-Border wall to stop illegal immigration (by definition breaking the rules--a country where laws are not enforced, or selectively, is a country of men and not laws) is a smart move. Mexico has a very robust border wall on their southern border. Stop with the double standard.
-Not a Muslim ban. It is a ban on immigration from the same 6 countries that President Obama banned immigration from... Because we are at war with those countries. Not banning immigration to those counties is akin to accepting military-aged men from Germany during WWII.
-Selling military equipment to our allies and those countries that serve to enrich the freedoms of their people is definitely a force for good. The same reason Americans have the right to bear arms, only on a more massive scale. Yes, it will make the world a better place.
-Yes, cut off Obamacare. It has increased premiums many hundreds of percent for many millions of Americans. Allowing people to get healthcare after they get sick is completely backwards economics and cannot be sustained in perpetuity (this makes logical sense, and you're genuinely an idiot or blinded by your desire to force things if you cannot see it).
Yes, go ahead and continue. You're arguments are already well-refuted by many a commentator and hold no water.
Nevertheless, in the grand strategy, this is why I'm into bitcoin. Tactics require the strong to have confidence and defend themselves when facing evil.

Really anyone can consult you, but you must make sure you trust them, and of course do your own research.
And of course of course, only invest what you can afford. And invest in ideas in which you believe. If you do this last thing, even if an idea fails, you will never lose, because you put your effort into something in which you believed.

This is the old building more lanes to a road increases usage and does not alleviate congestion argument...
Perhaps there is some validity to that argument, but more lanes means more commerce is possible. If there isn't anything of value to travel to, then the lanes will not be used up, but infrastructure is possible with more lanes of traffic.
No, SegWit and Lightning Network ARE the way forward, and they do reduce block congestion by increasing capacity and compressing transactions. If this leads to more congestion because of more usage, THAT IS GOOD.
Kind of makes me think of broken window fallacy. I'll call this the road widening fallacy.

Definitely. The free market, through freedom of association, will punish them accordingly.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:35:52
Oh no, there is no doubt. Of course, and thank you for your words. All things being equal, if belief in the protocol continues to grow (and it can only grow through word-of-mouth [advertising]), the value will continue to rise.
-Fiat constantly inflating.
-Population of world constantly increasing.
-User base constantly increasing.
-Companies accepting bitcoin for transactions constantly increasing.
-Total goods and services across the globe constantly increasing.
-Bitcoin being inherently deflationary (for above reasons and limited supply).
-Bitcoin having the strongest selling point of any currency: that it is decentralized and trustless.
The value will only continue to trend up, volatility will continue to decrease as liquidity continues to increase.
Bitcoin is barely more than a fetus right now.

Slow clap.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:00:26
Eh, even if it does fall for a couple more days, the general trend is still up. It only need not break the 1600 level, and it would still be following a very well-established trend line that started 3 years ago.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:43:55
What I fear, is people losing belief in bitcoin and the things for which it stands, IF ethereum passes it in market cap...
Bitcoin is already a proof-of-work coin with far more tenure than ethereum. Based purely on its history, it should survive, but if people do not know what it is for which they stand, we are in deep water.
This history counts! Do NOT let go of it! You are right, OP, there's no way ethereum can maintain this momentum in perpetuity, or much longer for that matter.
Harden yourselves. Even if the price of bitcoin falls to $20, remember why we're here!
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:34:45
Hey man, you still made a massive profit and helped build liquidity in the system. Don't beat yourself up too much. Without you being a first mover, there would be no way the value would have reached where it is now. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:19:38
This makes much better sense. I was confused yesterday by someone saying a soft fork would cause a split chain in the same way a hard fork would, but it would only for the hold-outs of the old tech, on which miners would make less money.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:50:09
Your selling of bitcoin for actual goods is HIGHLY important. It's giving it true value.
Don't beat yourself up too much. Just keep buying, and don't ever sell all of what you have. Eventually you'll have a hell of a nest egg.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:45:29
Compared to the other cryptos, yes, I would say it's an elder statesmen, but in terms of its own maturity, it is still a fetus.

The job of progressing through resistance is thankless, but once we get through to the other side, we will know victory. We just cannot expect to see it while we're actually in the fight.
We will be chided and resented while fighting the battle, never having been given credit for our successes, never having gotten gratitude for the work we did do, and then when we get to the other side, very few of those same naysayers will actually change their minds. They'll just start using it begrudgingly. 
Such is the way progress works; the whole world tends to be moved by no more than a handful of individuals, and below them a few thousand people trying to support them.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:28:36

I'm not whining, I'm addressing an important point. If you address an important point with good logical arguments, as I have, you are adding to the social capital of the individuals making up the infrastructure of the ecosystem.

Those are good points that I agree need to be addressed. However, they start to get addressed with the LN and SW. SegWit compacts the transactions as well as increases the block size slightly, lightning network bundles those already compacted transactions. These things together exponentially increase theoretical transaction volume. But it must be noted that the LN will only start off compressing the transaction count slightly. It will take many years before the transaction bundles fit more than a few thousand transactions per bundle.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:34:57
This comment assumes that banks would not divest from fiat at an adequate rate. While this scenario is perhaps possible, it is highly unlikely as I see it.
By the time the financial markets could potentially collapse in this scenario, not only would the smart financial institutions be adequately divested, but so too would the everyday person across the globe.
Economic depressions are not positive when they are fomented by a small cabal as you stated, in a Hegelian Dialectic model, in order to destroy smaller institutions so that the cabal may consolidate their holdings, as happened during the Great Depression.
Without a central bank, as was the case during President Monroe's tenure, economic recessions/depressions are far shorter in duration.
Nevertheless, I appreciate the warning. If we address the issues now, we may be able to prevent them from happening.
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:08:14
So are you telling me that the hard fork would not create two separate coins if there is not the required level of consensus?
If this be the case, then I don't understand why people would want UASF. This does not make sense. A soft fork, as I understand it, does not change the underlying protocol.
I ain't an idiot, man. Just explain it to me. Maybe you can convince me. But so far, I can't understand why someone would want a hard fork over a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:48:15

Ethereum is proof-of-stake (soon to be), and bitcoin is proof-of-work. Both have valuable places in this world. One is contracts the other is money.
But if ethereum overtakes bitcoin's market cap, it will turn the history of cryptocurrency into trash, spitting in the face of all the pioneers that worked their asses off to give us this one chance to save the world from the central banks.
What--the--f@ is going on with ethereum? This is not good! Don't just say I'm providing FUD. I need good arguments as to how this is not bad.
I'm getting very angry because it seems that r/bitcoin keeps burying posts I make on the topic! LISTEN!!
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:25:11
You will buy when the price dips if you believe in the idea because you will say to yourself, "Oh shit, I've got to help! This needs to work!"
It's usually hard to do this because most investors don't fully believe in the idea in which they are investing, but instead are treating money as an ends in and of itself rather than a means to an ends. In this case, bitcoin is both a means and an ends (a paradox, which is what makes it so wonderful).
You must BELIEVE in the idea if you want it to succeed. And that will also cause you to push through any resistance that may present itself, from inflexible developers and miners, to possible hard forks, to 51% attacks, and so on.
You must BELIEVE in the idea, but you will only believe in the idea if you have an underlying understanding of the importance of belief, which requires you to believe in yourself, and humanity. It requires acceptance of free will, and discarding of possible nihilism and hedonism.
It all goes together, but if bitcoin has the history, and people don't give up on it, it will make it through, even if it experiences some intermittent and sometimes extreme price drops and/or crises.

When I bought an HTC Vive about a month ago, it was $700. They made 100% off the bitcoin transaction I made with them. I don't understand why they eliminated bitcoin transactions as an option. They would have been making money hand-over-fist.

Lol I had a really old client that didn't have that option. But essentially yes :-)
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:10:22
You're missing the point. I'm talking about with regards to the bitcoin ecosystem.
You have to commit to your position to give someone a good vector. Jihan and the others are committing to their position to resist healthy scaling in the bitcoin ecosystem, acting as Devil's Advocates. Their choice, but now we know where they stand, and I stand to resist them.
Therefore, let me clarify I suppose: if they say to do something in the bitcoin ecosystem, I will do exactly the opposite (unless they want their history to be trash, rather than committed to their cause).
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:26:17

That is the surest means by which you don't lose it, so long as you keep track of where it all is on your own. That's the simplest form of diversifying, and the best. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Yes, it will be a bit more difficult to keep track of it all, but the onus is on you to do so, not incumbent upon some centralized third party that you are required to trust.
Our world has become so backwards that it has become a sin rather than a virtue to many who have no idea otherwise, to diversify and decentralize.
Don't worry, you're making the right decision. But always be cautious. Have good bookkeeping, and make sure you fully understand/believe in the idea before investing.

Proof of work is essential, for that is what money actually is supposed to be. If you eliminate that from the underlying protocol of bitcoin, it will no longer be viable money... 
No, we cannot change proof of work if we want bitcoin to succeed. The other two points are good though. I would change step 3 to activate LN.

We're going to make a lot of new friends here in the next few days ;-)

And that is a hard find in today's day and age.

I was thinking the exact same thing: bitcoin is starting to have its "happening," and TPTB want to make sure that you stay in a commodity/currency that they can continue to manipulate (gold/silver). Therefore, the prices are being pressured up. The only way you can stop those bastards is to outwit them with a better system, and then out-will them by taking all of their attempts to break that new system.
God, this is glorious. Those f@ bastards controlling the central banks are going to pay dearly for everything they've done, and I'm loving every bit of it!!

Well, just as any market operates, it eventually boils down to a "red vs. blue" phenomenon, where there are only a few giant movers. Something similar to grass taking over an environment if the soil is fertile. That is because nothing can compete better than grass, which grows fast, pervasively, and can grow anywhere essentially. Whereas a tree requires space, depth and more.
There have actually been many scientific studies on this. It's not necessarily a bad thing, because those few options become ideal solutions, but there are risks to it.

Someone is not investing wisely. He will mourn when the price drops 100 dollars, and go crazy when it rises 100 dollars...

If bitcoin fails, it is bad. Those who put in the work deserve for their history of belief to matter. If bitcoin fails, the whole foundation of cryptocurrencies will fall into the waste heap and become nothing but another central banking scheme. None of the souls that invested their belief into the idea will have any energy left to keep going, and thus the establishment institutions will find ways to either break whatever is created afterwards, or turn it into their abomination (reference Ripple...).

Perhaps. That isn't necessarily a bad idea, but I don't think we'll need that for quite some time. SHA256 is impressively secure so far.

People who are hell-bent on turning the history of blockchain technology into trash...
We won't let them. They'll decrepify and turn to nothing if they can't stand with the rest of us trying to get true, healthy scaling accomplished.

Ethereum is proof-of-stake (soon to be), and bitcoin is proof-of-work. Both have valuable places in this world. One is contracts the other is money.
But if ethereum overtakes bitcoin's market cap, it will turn the history of cryptocurrency into trash, spitting in the face of all the pioneers that worked their asses off to give us this one chance to save the world from the central banks.
What--the--f@ is going on with ethereum? This is not good! Don't just say I'm providing FUD. I need good arguments as to how this is not bad.

It needs to happen, and if we have to run that risk, then so be it...
But I am almost certain you are woefully incorrect.
