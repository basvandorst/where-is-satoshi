The duplicate sim seems too incriminating because there would be a record of the request and address to which it is sent.
Regarding the first item, I would only buy into that if the person created their account recently. The flood of mt gox hacks recently would imply either people have been hacked on a massive scale or mt gox has been hacked. The latter seems more likely. I don't know though. I guess a better 2 FA initial setup would be to send the code over sms instead of in a browser.

I could write code to create XCP for anyone sending money to a 'genesis block' instead destroying the money. If you don't need a distribution from the genesis block, then why does that stop you sending money to some address that is valid? I find it amazing that a group of people could not come to an agreement of how that money could be used in a positive way so they decide to destroy it. Even to fund some development, testing, code reviews, or dare I say marketing efforts. What about Sean's outpost? The source code could be written to recognize transactions to any particular address as being the one to use for XCP. They don't have to be destroyed. I find it somehow saddening that you guys wiped out 0.01% of the currency for this project.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:51:35
How do they pay taxes? As a dollar value based on the time of transaction? It bitcoin value, so cab vary over time?
If dollar value at time of transaction, holding 100 percent bitcoin seems like it is a risky way to do business and indicates a small amount if transactions are performed using bitcoin.

Is there any measure of how safe your private data is? Lets say I save 1MB, what is the level of replication in the network to ensure it will not be non-recoverable? How long does it take for it to be replicated and distributed? Is this dynamic? If I save data and it is distributed and I never touch it for years and those computers disappear from the network, will maidsafe recognize that old data from old systems is no longer available with the same level of redundancy and will then spread to newer systems?
Could someone try to damage the network by providing a large number of nodes donating significant storage space that the network uses and then he/she suddenly disconnects all from the network? Is it possible that the redundancy/replication is not sufficient to recover all data?

Because this is a new protocol that sits on top of bitcoin that has new features.

I just read up a little bit on XCP Counterparty - I didn't realize it was using the bitcoin blockchain.
It seems proof-of-burn is only for the initial funding. So you've wiped 1.2 million dollars of bitcoin out of the market, making the rest of us richer - thanks,  I guess. Why not nominate a charity or two and have them receive the funds?
So this is a mastercoin/nxt/ethereum competitior.

 looks to be quite unfinished and is missing a specification.

I'm not impressed that they rely on a solution from blockchain.info and are now dependent on an external company for what is a decentralized protocol. Either that or they have just copied their code.
I find it interesting that they only now have started sending emails indicating when successful login occurs. It seems likely that the people who think they've been recently hacked have in fact been hacked for a while and they just haven't known about it.
They should also provide an account history feature so people can see when logins occur.

Maybe by poll of the investors. I'd recommend a really big charity so that the money ($1.2m) is not so significant as to potentially have a significant benefit to one of the founders or investors through some devious scheme.

That is a shitty way to look at it. You don't have a conscience if you do that. That would be scamming.
What is the solution? The merchant watches for transactions and will include a transaction based off the double-spend transaction with a total fee higher than the double-spend attempt so it is included as a priority? Or will merchants need personally identifying information to detect this kind of fraud and report you? If you double spend, you still owe the money.

What if miners choose to take a higher fee laden transaction over an earlier one with less fee? They wouldn't because it is evil and would break bitcoins utility and lower adoption and profits over the long term?

He is asking people to donate in bitcoin. They might have been doing it in fiat but now have a reason to try doing it in bitcoin.
If it gives someone sufficient incentive to give money to help a starving child, then that sounds pretty good too me. We don't need idealistic donations, just donations. As long as the person is donating with the belief it is benefiting mankind.

But why does it need to be burnt to make xcp? The xcp source could easily recognize transactions by a different criteria. Xcp is just a subsystem, any criteria could be defined as the initial contribution.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:44:02
XCP is a protocol and is open source. The number of starting XCP is defined by the transactions that went to an initial address. Noone can create new XCP except with a rewrite of that XCP source code, which the founders would not accept.

I was won over as soon as a read the white paper in 2011. It just made sense to me. The decentralized solution to the double spend was a game changer. I didn't see them as arbitrary digital units, they are the implementation of the first solution using this technology and successful as of 2011.

I've changed it so I no longer get it
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:22:26
No,  I think that anyone can figure out the balance and transactions on the bitcoin network without using an external service - because it is decentralized and all the information is in the blockchain. My point was that it would suck for mt gox to be dependent on an external service to provide their own services accurately. However, as somone pointed out, it is just to provide a new transaction id that can verify a transaction because the existing one cannot uniquely identify it if it has been broadcast by someone else with modified parameters. I don't have further details on the new transaction id implementation though.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:43:59
Nice ethereum plug
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:55:29
No. They should know all open issues about a protocol used for finance that have been open since 2011. And they attacked bitcoin for their ignorance. And they can solve it without a bitcoin update yet don't mention that.

I was going to buy $200 at mt gox to take a chance. I'm just waiting on it clearing it at dwolla and then will be sending it right back into my bank account. I feel quite lucky and even more so seeing the immense amount a lot of people have lost. I guess the ridiculous transaction times of fiat saved me $200!!! But seriously, fiat sucks.
@_date: 2014-01-25 05:48:06
I checked, they don't accept bitcoin... 
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:18:41
In this case, using a 'break' would make the flow control more obvious. If you have a bug in your code due to a goto and it is safety critical, you are in trouble.

Great advice for day traders :-S

It would be great if it had a feature to have deterministic private keys based on a seed like in electrum or armory. That way we would just need to backup one item once.

What exchanges have been shown to be fiction? If I put in a buy or sell order and it executes, it happens at the price I have chosen. People put in buy and sell orders at whatever prices they want. The prices that last execute dictate the price that is shown. Are you saying that the prices they show are not trades that are executing? That the prices that are executing are higher or lower? In which case, wouldn't that be reflected in the market data? Wouldn't you be able to detect that happening by putting in buys and sells across a sweep and seeing when they trigger?

You shouldn't really need to convince people of anything - the harder you try and frustration you show, the worse it will look. Leave the evangelism to people like Andreas Antonopoulos. Most people have no idea about technical matters and if they are not open minded and have their defenses up, there is no point pushing the same points.
I'd recommend that those people don't buy bitcoin. A backdoor would be visible in the source code - which is open source. No single government controls the entire internet.

資産総額	　　　　　3,841,866,163円
流動負債総額	　　　6,501,119,371円
（2） 当社の流動負債が増大した背景には，ビットコインの消失，預り金の消失という原因が考えられ，これについては，専門家による調査を依頼する等して真相の解明に全力であたります。申立の契機となったトラブルについては，以下のとおりです。
　　その後，当社の調査によって大量のビットコインがなくなっていたことが分かり，正確な状況はいまでも判明していないものの，平成２６年２月２４日頃までに，ユーザーの取引履歴上のビットコイン保有高であるおよそ７５万ビットコイン，及び，当社自身の取引履歴上の保有ビットコインである約１０万ビットコインのほぼ全てがなくなっていることが判明しました。当社は，なくなったビットコインは上記のバグが悪用により盗まれた可能性が高いと考えており，現在，刑事告訴の検討，手続を専門家に依頼しております。

To anyone concerned
Mark Karpeles
Representative Director
MtGox Co., Ltd.
Shibuya 2-11-5
Shibuya-ku, Tokyo
ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING AN APPLICATION FOR COMMENCEMENT OF A PROCEDURE OF CIVIL REHABILITATION
MtGox Co., Ltd. made today an application for commencement of a procedure of civil rehabilitation (minji saisei) at the Tokyo District Court. This application was accepted on the same day. Further, MtGox Co., Ltd is under several orders issued by the Court : a preservative order prohibiting it from paying its debts, transferring its assets or establishing security over its assets, an order establishing a comprehensive prohibition of forced attachment of its assets by its creditors and a supervisory order ordering supervision by a supervisory committee. In consequence, MtGox hereby informs you as follows.
We first express our most sincere regrets and apologies for this situation and for causing so much inconvenience to all our users and other interested parties. We will fully respect the above orders and maintain our assets with all the necessary care.
Financial situation, reasons and timeline leading to this application
(1) As of now, the liabilities of MtGox Co., Ltd exceed its assets and its financial situation is as follows:
Total amount of assets	 3,841,866,163
Total amount of current liabilities	 6,501,119,371
(2)	The increase of current liabilities may be linked to a loss of bitcoins and customer funds. These are now investigated by an expert and all efforts are made to discover the truth. This application was prompted by the following troubles:
At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug.
As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared.
We believe that there is a high probability that these bitcoins were stolen as a result of an abuse of this bug and we have asked an expert to look at the possibility of a criminal complaint and undertake proper procedures.
On the same day (24th), we found out large discrepancies between the amount of cash held in financial institutions and the amount deposited from our users. The amounts are still under investigation and may vary but they approximate JPY 2.8 billion.
We are investigating the causes of these problems. Since there are probably a variety of causes including hacking by third parties, we need to investigate a huge amount of transaction reports in order to establish the truth. As of this date, we cannot confirm the exact amount of missing deposit funds and the total amount of bitcoins which disappeared.
Once we discovered that bitcoins had disappeared and the discrepancies between cash funds and deposit balances, we judged that it would be difficult to continue our activities normally and we therefore closed our site at noon on the 25th (Japan time).
(3)	Regarding the filing of a complaint or damages report, an expert has been mandated and investigations have started. We will make all efforts to ensure that crimes are punished and damages recovered.
Further we will fully cooperate with inquiries from authorities and investigations related to this matter, in Japan or overseas.
In order to increase repayments to our creditors, it is necessary to explore the possibility of having MtGox Co., Ltd. continue its business. This is why the civil rehabilitation procedure has been chosen, Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community.
All efforts will now be made to restore the business and recover damages to repay debts to creditors. We hope for the understanding and cooperation of all.
