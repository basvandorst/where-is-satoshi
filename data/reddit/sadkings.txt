Did I miss a scam? I didn't check out the website. How much did you lose? ��

I was contemplating listing land for sale with a 'crypto accepted' notice. No need for exclusivity, but that sign serves the more noble purpose of promoting crypto ��

Honestly, I am just jealous that you got to meet Satoshi Nakamoto in person. He is pretty generous with his btc

The logic that governs most to fork, that of combatting evil asic manufacturers, seems flawed to me.   It cuts out consumer miners and provides asic manufacturers with another opportunity to mine popular coins exclusively. Asic manufacturers continue to sell the units regardless, as other coins gather momentum from the dwindling competition.

If antminers have a remote operation feature that we were somehow unaware of and antminers accounted for &gt;50% of the hashrate, then bitmain could execute one. The only way I see that happening is if it was executed by the state to cripple a particular country's economy. A double-edged sword, I would think...

Scenario 2: Some evil-doers develop hardware that is substantially more powerful than what is on the market, making it economically viable for them to manufacture and execute such a devious plot.

Did I miss someone unlocking ASIC Boost on the Antminers? Or have I been trolled? ��
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:11:08
Well, it is now. ��

Last I checked, ASIC Boost was a feature hidden in Antminers and people were experimenting with activating it. If I recall, it also required the pool to support it. Your pic indicates that a pool supports it, so has Bitmain allowed its use in their firmware? Or has someone found a way to enable it otherwise? Or do you just use other mining hardware?

You cannot rely on your merchants to be well informed about crypto. Adoption will come from payment systems that simplify the process for the layman.

Best Practice: Sign up with a reputable exchange. This will require identification documents to get verified. The process can take a few days. Most take currency via wire. Wire your account money. Purchase BTC (Also XBT on some exchanges) or whatever cryptocurrency suits your fancy. If you intend to hold your currency for an extended period, send that currency to your own wallet. (Read up on wallets and safe use and storage of your 'keys')
