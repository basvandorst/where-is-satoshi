I've gotten banned 3 times, the last I did on purpose. First 2 times, I mentioned poor moderating. I was then told mentioning anything bad about the mods or their moderating was against forum policy. You can't say anything bad about the moderators or will be banned 7 days. SA are trollish goons. BTW, Don't Snitch. Best thing about Reddit, they don't ban TOR. Basically I'm going to ruin this subreddit, and get it locked down, unless I get unbanned from bitcointalk and my other account is allowed to post here. XD I hope you see this Theymos. There is nothing you can do to stop me from ruining your subreddit, without completely fucking over your subbreddit.

The last one was best. 2 overtly gay dudes flippro and wolftaur were arguing with each other in offtopic. So I posted this:  
I got banned 3 days for it. What got me perma-banned was I put it in my sig. Technically that's 4 but I was already banned. Like Ol Dirty Said (R.I.P.) "I'm The Man Of All Rainbows".
