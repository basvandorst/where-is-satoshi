So many futures...
Future 3:  You watch BTC hit $30k, $40k, but at the same time E\*\* reaches $2k, $4k and replaces BTC as  coin (at least temporarily). You get scared to lose $millions so you sell at $40k and lower. It turns out that E\*\* couldn't keep the  and soon afterwards BTC continues to $200k.

Isn't sell the bull, buy the bear a better strategy? 
If it's hard to sell near the market top, how is buying the bear (near market bottom) easier? If you think you should buy continuously through the bear market, why not sell continuously through the bull market??

The taxes are an order of magnitude lower than potential profits.
Future 1: You watch BTC hit $30k, $40k, $50k and you are tempted to sell. You don't have the foresight to sell above $150k, so you are OK with hodling for next 5 years.
Future 2: You watch BTC hit $30k, $40k, $50k and you are tempted to sell. You decide to sell above $100k. The price reaches $90k and starts falling sharply (20% on the first day). You are OK with hodling for next 5 years.

Banning crypto is a real risk. Some may say it's 1% risk, others 20% or 70% risk but it's a risk. That's why you don't send all of your long term fiat savings to Coinbase right now and buy crypto.

Why don't you share your plan, Mr. Downvoter?
