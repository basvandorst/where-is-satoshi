Yeah just do an OTC trade.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:37:44
Everything is insurable.

Or you could just skip the broker fee and go to r/otccrypto and connect with traders peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:14:06
Look it can be changed, we are thinking about adding more. I just made this sub because I needed a community who was interested in doing more complex trades.
Idk about you but I see a number of big short opportunities and it's not possible to do them without an over the counter trade.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:59:58
Just use r/otccrypto. It's where big holders can make trades peer to peer over the counter.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:34:21
Buy doing what i'm doing. Asking the market.

Sorry for being a bit rude, it's just that people on reddit sometimes are a little frustrating. 
So Tether is a token that is built on top of something called the Omni layer of bitcoin. I also believe it is an ethereum token now too.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:33:52
Yes. Tether is built on bitcoin. And works with Bitcoin. Thank you though.

Ok if you say you are a good broker. Male me a couple short positions. If you can do this I will be happy to pay the big fee.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:36:50


Yeah "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." heard this before. Hey if you can lend me some BQX I will do a deal with you right now.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:02:46
Just do an OTC trade. All you have to do is post your trade on r/otccrypto !
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:28:32


Why don't you just use r/otccrypto. OTC Crypto is a marketplace specifically for over the counter trades that you can't do on traditional exchanges. We are also building a verification process to and future escrow services way in the future. Check it out.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:58:18
For over the counter stuff, in general, you can check out r/otccrypto. It's a place that connects buyers and sellers of trades that you can't do on traditional exchanges.

Thank you.

I think it will be difficult to pay in bitcoin regardless of the adoption, just because it's hard to spend an asset that is appreciating.
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:49:09
I love when the market is like this. My thoughts are that if you believe in the market as a whole, the best strategy is to just hold you favorite two coins. When the price goes down just buy more.
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:38:20
What does the 1% look like?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:43:30
Why should I trust them
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:19:15
Yeah you have a great point. It's like the people that are like well I have something backed by gold. Wtf is gold backed by?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:24:16
Are there any stable coins out there that actually work
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:57:41
Yep. What token out there do you think will actually work one day as a stable coin? Is it going to be Bitcoin, Dai, Eth, ZCash, Monero? What is it going to be?
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:18:26
that's kinda cool
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:44:28
Does it? I have never used it. Is it backed by a physical dollar in a bank?
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:18:33
I don't.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:33:26
Same thing happened to me.
