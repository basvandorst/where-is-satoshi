The thing is, apple controls the software, so even without 'crony capitalism' and 'political monopoly', they have the entire vertical chain locked down regardless.

Most people here ARE libertarians, you can tell by all the batshit insane poe's law type postings here.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:05:55
Actually yes.

Libertarians losing money in bitcoin again? LOL.

It was more about a comment about libertarians thinking unregulated money is a good idea than him crying about going to the cops.  
Unregulated money is NEVER a good idea.  Yeah, my US dollar experiences inflation, but at least it's stable and it's backed up by the FDIC and i never have to think about it.  If i were to start getting into bitcoins, i'd be a paranoid wreck because i'd assume EVERYONE is scamming me.  I don't know about you, but I like sleeping soundly at night, it's priceless to me.  And with FIAT money, i do.

*Who wants to run or shop at a site where the prices change every five minutes?*
Bitcoins is an inherently unstable currency.  I highly doubt it gets high adoption because of this.
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:26:34
Really? If i had bitcoins, i wouldn't send them in exchange for services/product WITHOUT an intermediary.  That's just insanity.  I mean, i could setup a fake website, sell a fake product, collect bitcoins and close up shop and nobody would be able to trace it.  
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:48:21
Some libertarians actually do believe in no government, but in any case, have fun trying to regulate a currency whose main characteristic is to be anonymous.
Edit: And besides that, most libertarians believe in abolishing the Fed and letting the market give us competing currencies.  
@_date: 2011-08-04 03:19:40
Wall Street getting involved in an unstable currency with lots of unresolved flaws and using DERIVATIVES? This won't end in tears at all.
What i meant to say was... "YAY FREE MARKET!"

It blows me away that he attacks FIAT money on this show.  Bitcoin has made me appreciate the US dollar all that much more.  Do i have inflation with my dollars? Yeah, but it's still relatively stable and SECURE, and Bitcoin is very unstable (and has experienced ridiculous deflation and then inflation right now) and INSECURE.

I think it'd be easier catching a bank robber than a bitcoin robber considering it's a 'feature' that bitcoin transactions are untraceable.

God damnit, stop giving people bad advice.  Have you ever heard of 0 day malware? Your antivirus won't catch it until your antivirus updates it's definitions and by then it's too late.
@_date: 2011-08-01 00:36:36
Yeah, i think the fees are going to be so high, it won't be practical.  Who the hell wants to insure bits? Also the fact that bitcoins is an unstable currency as well, it'd be hard to price.
@_date: 2011-08-03 14:51:00
Yes, because it's self evident that Bitcoins is an inherently flawed 'currency', how many thefts/system failures/market value crashes/and other ridiculous stories about bitcoins do you guys need before it's obvious that this isn't going to work out.

Well, looks like you're dumber than the author of the article, that's for sure.

*The utility in bitcoin is paying for things without having to go through the big credit card monopoly.*
LoL, yeah, credit cards sure do suck (until you experience fraud and the credit card, BY LAW, has to cover you).  Now what happens again when you get defrauded with bitcoins? I believe the acronym SOL comes to mind.
@_date: 2011-09-10 00:11:48

LOL what, bitcoin's reputation is getting worse than that of penny stocks now.
@_date: 2011-08-03 14:52:04
I think it has everything to do with bitcoins.  You want an anonymous 'currency' with multiple points of failure... well, that's what you guys signed up for. 
Me? I like having my money insured by the FDIC.  My bank's computers and backups could all burn to the ground and i wouldn't bat an eye.
@_date: 2011-08-03 14:53:45
I'm sorry, but i trust my US Dollars more than bitcoins.  My bank's computers and backups could all burn into the ground and i wouldn't bat an eye because the FDIC insures it.

@_date: 2011-08-07 01:46:04
Can't wait until all these bitcoin enthusiasts 'go galt' and form some secret community where they all kill each other because they can't even trust each other with their own currency.
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:24:50
Because Bitcoins is an even shittier currency than the US Dollar and only retard libertarians think it's worthwhile (although even that is started to change).
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:02:10
*And I'm wondering if it's worth getting into*
Lol no, it went from being worth nothing to $30 to around $8 during this weekend crash.  Tons of scams going on.  
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:21:40
It's almost like regulation of money is there for a reason or something.
@_date: 2011-08-03 14:58:18
*a form of accountability*
Yes, it's called the government and jail time.  An anonymous currency circumvents that.  This is the dumbest thing libertarians have rallied around yet.

Dear moron libertarians who bought tons of computer hardware in hopes of 'getting rich quick' on yet another bad libertarian idea: I'm in need of a new rig and i figure you're about to flood the market with ATI cards.  I'll take a 6950 with say a 50% haircut off the lowest newgg price before they all start flooding ebay.

The religious devotion that libertarians have to bitcoin sure is cute.  This is bordering on Scientology level delusion.

No, because only a retard would put money under their mattress.  My money's safe, it's insured by the FDIC.  What alternatives does bitcoin have? You have multiple points of failure.
@_date: 2011-08-09 01:43:16
How do you provide that kind of insurance on a currency so unstable.  ALso, credits HAVE to do that by law.
@_date: 2011-11-01 02:29:50
It lost like 90%+ of it's value since the middle of this year.  That and there has been a ton of high profile frauds/thefts related to it.  I would say it's a failure.

The video should be renamed to Libertarians.avi 
Literally everything you need to know about Libertarians you can learn from this episode.
3 incredibly funny things from this incident:
1) Watching Libertarians cry to the federal and international law enforcement to get their money back
2) The nature of bitcoins making this nearly impossible for the bitcoins to be recovered. 
3) The near religious devotion that bitcoiners STILL have after all these debacles.  If libertarians were rational, the weekend Bitcoin crash they're experiencing right now would be even more brutal.  The value of bitcoins is way too damn high still and it's being propped up by this religious dogma.  Is the ghost of Ayn Rand whispering to you to keep this madness up while your wealth is being eaten away?

It's probably easier to start a business when all your basic needs are taken care of (i.e. 80% of singaporeans live in public housing). 
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:33:23


There's been the whole debate about Krugman vs. Peter Schiff and if you look at Krugman's writing post 2008 crash, most of Krugman's predictions have come true whereas most of Peter Schiff's predictions have been mostly false, so there's that (i.e. inflation, the dollar, the stock market, etc.)

There are critics, even from libertarians, about how they measure 'economic freedom'
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:15:51
The heritage index is arbitrary, even many libertarians think the way they rank 'economic freedom' is dumb:
Also, 80% of singaporeans live in public housing, the state owns many of the business (Singapore Airlines, for example, is socialized), there's universal healthcare, etc.  Most American libertarians would be pissed off at such an arrangement. Could you imagine what would happen if Barrack Obama suddenly said that most Americans could get access to government housing if they couldn't afford to live where they were now?
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:16:19
That, and the fact that their 'economic freedom' is way overstated
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:38:26
There are now a multitude of competing bitcoin-like currencies that have the same technology, but they are far less valuable than bitcoin.

Easier to have low taxes when your have a city state (and the government owns businesses), public money spent is more efficient when you have such high population density.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:24:51
If the price doesn't go down a lot, that sorta proves bitcoin is kind of irrational actually.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:11:27
Because if you don't have to worry about being bankrupted from like, for example, a medical problem, you can focus more on building a business.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:11:12
Uhm, 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing, they have universal healthcare, and a lot of business there is socialized by the government.
