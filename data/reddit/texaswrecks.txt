Thank BitSanta!

Sell directly to buyers.  I honestly know nothing about the details, but it seems an inherent part of the currency.  
But yea, MtGox just sent me an email about verifying my details or get locked out.....  Not sure I'd want my money locked up.  
Let us know what you decide to do, I may need a new method as well.  :)

Wire deposits are guaranteed for that 26$ fee.  It's good to know they can at least do that well.  
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2012-12-06 21:55:59
Responsive support also.
@_date: 2012-06-25 15:12:07
I don't know.  If it ain't broke, I don't fix it.
@_date: 2012-12-29 01:45:35
Why are you squeezing that chip between your butt cheeks?

Create a mt gox account.
Go to Bitinstant.com and choose:
Cash Deposit &gt; Mt Gox Account
Follow instructions.  See $$ in your MT GOX account, buy bitcoins.

Bitcoin is right where it needs to be.  
@_date: 2012-12-12 21:41:02
This and only this.  Offline storage.
If you are targeted for your bitcoins, getting your passphrase is the weakest link, because your computer is insecure, unless it's not on the internet.
@_date: 2012-11-07 17:08:20
This has apparently been discussed at length before the idea occurred to the rest of us.  It gives me hope. 
Thanks for the explanation.  
Another issue:  How to get a feasable hash-chaining system adopted by the voting-machine companies (since it's a cluster-fuck of criminal companies).?
@_date: 2012-11-07 16:54:00
He's proposing a completely different system/client. 
Also, why would they ask for bitcoin?  It's not even a 'real' currency to them.  They would undermine trust in the dollar.
@_date: 2012-11-09 16:52:30
From these comments it sounds like they should be avoided as more reliable and more responsive avenues exist.
@_date: 2012-06-25 19:03:29
If your doing legitimate activity with a large amount of funds then it's better that you do.
I guess they want it for withdrawals?  Couldn't you just sell your bc on the open market?
@_date: 2012-11-11 01:51:22
Exactly, some evolutionary bastard will be the de facto cryptocurrency by then, with a spot of luck.
@_date: 2013-02-16 02:56:09
I did not know a credit check was req'd.  have not seen that on my credit report.   Have you seen one on yours?
@_date: 2013-02-16 02:31:42
Sucks that it's typical.  I hoped because they got $510,000 from YC they could get their shit together and act professional.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:27:20
trade options on CoinBr!    :)
@_date: 2013-01-11 20:24:32
No, Thank you!
@_date: 2013-01-17 23:34:02
And counting.  Although the total volume today was half of what it usually was -- at least that's what I'm told on bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2013-02-17 20:18:32
Mine too.  I'm going on 2.5 days of missing btc.  I sent out bitcoins I had previously bought and were already in my account for days.  
They never arrived.  After they came back online, 32 hours later I got an emails saying 100BTC (missing amount) had been sent to me from the hot wallet.  I immediately sent them to my secure wallet -- this wallet said it was a double spend!    They never got confirmed. Still in coinbase as "pending" and not yet in block.
Very shady business dealings.  No response from support AT ALL.  
@_date: 2013-02-18 02:49:14
This issue is completely resolved.  Thank you, coinbase.
@_date: 2013-01-11 16:58:39
It's also still in BETA, and they didn't want some bug losing money for themselves or customers.  It's a smart way to do it. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 03:32:36
Site is backup.  transaction is still "Pending" not in a block yet.
@_date: 2013-01-18 17:39:45
I only want to get in on SDICE.  But I can't find a reputable way to do so.
Thanks for the hint at the CAVIRTEX partnership.  Do you have any information on that?  
@_date: 2013-02-03 02:28:12
I have 20+ successful transactions with not a single instance of this.  
They have responded within 24 hrs of any email I sent (they were really only questions about the transaction listings and order sorting).  
I haven't found an easier way to buy bitcoins.  I buy and hold so I don't need them overnight.
OP has a brand spankin' new Reddit account.  Clearly has an agenda.
@_date: 2013-01-22 17:41:35
I agree.  The analyzers on bitcointalk.org who sell their services for 2.5BTC a month have been no better than the people randomly say what they think the market will do.  
The data that exists is too small, too volatile, and the market forces are changing to quickly. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 02:13:42
Been 3 days since support response.  Several emails since, questioning several unmentioned changes to their services.
Quite curious if anyone has info, considering the missing 100BTC.'
Actually missing now for 10 hours.....  
@_date: 2013-01-03 00:16:28
Bitcoin doesn't have to replace anything.  Its perks are in being a store of value, instantaneous and verifiable transactions, and anonymity.  
We need to allow people to adopt BTCs through these amazing features.  Anything else will flow from that.  The economy you are talking may or may not flow from that. 
Also, some people are paid in bitcoins already.
@_date: 2013-01-18 17:47:38
The described attack wouldn't work because you can only attach bank accounts directly, not debit cards.
But I also appreciate your brain punch for abusers of this, the best, way to get bitcoins.  I vow to also punch them in the brain.
@_date: 2013-01-11 16:33:18
I believe that bitcoin fills the gap for instantaneous worldwide transactions, anonymity, government avoidance, and it may turn out to be a stable store of value.  
I'm not sure it completely superior to all properties of government fiat.  Adoption should focus on these areas bitcoin does really well.  The other areas will probably develop organically as adoption grows based on those really good properties of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-01-08 02:04:14
Just got Private Internet Access via Bitcoins.  Had no idea they accepted it until I began to pay.  I realize now I should have sought that out.  
It just so happens one of the most private services happens to take bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-17 04:44:03
They finally sent me 100BTC from the hot wallet.  Which doesn't make any sense as it should have been in mine already.  
Very shady business dealings so far.  They are in over their head.  Suggest an exchange until they get right and learn to communicate with customers.
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:11:05
They also fixed mine.  After 4 days of insanity.  But they fixed it, that's what is important.
@_date: 2013-01-19 18:46:16
Great information.  My fears are slowly melting.  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-01-29 03:21:45
Doesn't the blockchain retain a record of the wallet?  Wallet.dat may disappear, but the wallet remains empty in the blockchain, no?
@_date: 2013-02-04 02:57:01
These purposes will continue to be discovered as the mainstream drug and gambling sites hold down the economy in the meantime.
You wouldn't be on the internet w/out porn, our kids won't use bitcoin without illicit drug trade and gambling.  It's a requirement as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-02-28 18:34:48
They are hiring for that position very recently.
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:08:15
Bitcoin is the yin in an otherwise yang financial system.
@_date: 2013-01-19 18:44:06
Hello!  
I believe I'll start small to assuage my fears and see where it goes.  It's nice to see you are keeping your ear to the ground.  
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-01-18 18:38:30
DeaDTerra, I didn't know that.  He seems legit on bitcointalk.org.  
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-02-04 02:59:31
Clearly that restriction does not keep out trolls and scammers.
I would argue that these people are crucial to the evolution of bitcoin users themselves.  The algorithm is solid, it's the idiot users that need training.  
let them be drained of their btcs while they learn the basic lessons of finance and personal responsibility.  They will be thankful in the future if they learn anything.
@_date: 2013-02-16 03:29:06
Can you confirm?
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:43:59
He is part of this community. MPEX generates a ton of economic activity and much profit is made.

Anything is plausible.

Good Luck!

Not a bad strategy.  80% of profit is from 20% of customers.   And 80% of headache is from 20% of your least profitable customers.  
I don't blame them for weeding out.  I blame them for unprofessional communication at their current level of operation.  Beta or not, they need a business manager.
I'm employed, but willing to move, coinbase, have great connections to entrepreneur advice from tried and true businessmen.

i do .001 *minimum* as a rule.  that's only $.16 to those who secure the blockchain.

there's also CoinBr.  
yeah that's a ref link.   good luck on the options trading!

It's only a placebo, but it will give you the time you need.  
Emotions run high with BTC and $, gotta placate with whatever you have around until you can say "everything is ok!  See?"
A Ticket number is a great subconscious pacifier.  
@_date: 2013-02-16 03:30:07
I am worried.  But your site is now back up.  Well done.
Fred, support emails are important. At least have a bot respond that says "we have rec'd your email, we will respond shortly"..
That will gain you another few hours before hellfire falleth down on your heads for these kinds of things.

You cannot delete anything on the blockchain.  It may only be emptied and forgotten.
