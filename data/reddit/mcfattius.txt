When I first started watching bitcoin around the beginning of the year I was very interested in the possibilities. however the more i learn the less i am inclined to "invest/bet" any of my money for the following reasons: 1: to difficult to acquire in the US. The aging population, where vast reserves of cash are, struggle to turn on a computer let alone create a bitcoin wallet. 2. too many bitcoin fanatics are holding on to there precious coin waiting for that "to the moon" moment to arrive.  If they were really interested in seeing a true value accumulate they would be spending their bitcoins like crazy and demanding that merchants/vendors accept it. too much need for regulation which defeats the purpose and value of bitcoin. so as for me I see a steady drop back down to the sub-dollar and then poof as interest continues to wane.

I just made a purchase on newegg and a purchase on coinbase to replenish. no problem.
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:49:06
prove it
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:01:47
I first heard of bitcoin by reading an article on  in December of 2013 when it was at its peak. At first I was very skeptical about it thinking that it was just another Pump and Dump, but have since become obsessed with it. Yes I have a problem. I live and work in a demographically older area where the majority of people are at retirement age. and most of my acquaintances are over 50. When i mention bitcoin they think i am talking about a quarter there is almost 0 understanding of the concept. of course the majority of these people struggle to turn the computer on so there's that. 
On a side note I would like to also mention that I received my first taste of bitcoin through a change tip which gave me the opportunity to experiment before putting my own money at risk. so thank you to the changetip community:)

I can appreciate the bosses standpoint in this situation.

Regulation is a necessary evil it is not wise to disregard the safeguards that are being put into place. I am absolutely positive that these additional safeguards are not Coinbase's idea of a good business move. I am sure they are doing it to comply with regulations imposed on them by outside regulatory agencies. these regulations are imposed, in theory to protect the average consumer from nefarious characters I would be more concerned about the legitimacy of coinbase if these safeguards were not being put in place. as for the IRS if you do not want to pay your taxes to them move to a different country and pay your taxes there. the only way bitcoin will ever come out of obscurity and into the mainstream is through a certain degree of regulation and safeguards.

Well... you've made me a believer. I've never seen more convincing evidence that that. Believe the Benji's Bitches.

This is a great idea anytime a radio host mentions bitcoin in any context bad or good we should as a community changetip them to give them a better education!
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:44:41
I say take one for the team and bid $750 per coin. which in turn will increase the value for everyone.

I have seen the light and the error in my ways. This is me eating crow. lets just say i didnt think bitcoin could recover from mt. gox
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:16:56
I had the same train of thought. and then I realized that they had been in talks/negotiations with visa and MasterCard which means, if anything, that they are taking the opposite approach to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:30:40
i just blew my F5 Load
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:45:45
This made me laugh, because it is likely true. however, the more people that inquire the less "weird" it will become. So feel free to go to Intuits site and ask away. For wider adoption we as a community have to open our mouths.

"There are only two ways out of this dead-end debt street: a catastrophic global financial collapse or a courageous act declaring an international debt jubilee, that is, the forgiveness of all outstanding debts and the rebuilding of a global money system not based on debt."  
This paragraph is what really got me thinking of how deep we are because of fractional reserve banking. Wow.

@_date: 2014-12-05 04:09:16
Thanks everyone that showed up and played. for the life of me i can't figure out the downvotes. I am addicted to this. guess some people just don't like competition. I will host another game in the next few days after I have time to come up with some new and improved challenges and have rethought how to market to the wider audience! thanks again it was a blast

I hope to have the opposite story.I first heard of bitcoin around December when it was at its peak on started researching bitcoin / tor / silkroad,  which were all part of the article. started watching bitcoin price along with my other stocks. created an account on mt gox to play around with bitcoin a little. luckily I never got around to actually buying any through mtgox. watched the price plummet because of mtgox collapse/china issues. thought for sure bitcoin was doomed.  watched it fall to ~$350 and thought maybe I will buy some. signed up with coinbase. got discouraged with the sign up process watched the price sky rocket to $550 decided to take the dive. by the time my coinbase account had cleared for purchase, price was at ~$650 bought and have watched as the price has done nothing so currently I am neither up nor down but hoping for the moon. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:06:45
can we get a comment from a verified coinbase rep regarding this post. I just asked a coinbase chat rep and he gave a very disconcerning response:
"is there any validity to the security breach news that was just posted on reddit?
Seth: I do apologize for any inconvenience, but what you are describing is outside the scope of features available with live chat. For further assistance with this matter, I would suggest filling out a support ticket at  or email directly to support and we'll reply as soon as possible."

@_date: 2014-07-10 03:54:02
ah but not  to worry because they have promised to continue manipulating the artificial interest rate... to prevent the market from crashing. does this make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:07:08
This is the truth. it sure does open your eyes to how currency works and how ignorant most people are. Bitcoin may not be the "CURE" to the current financial mess the world is in but once you partake the issue becomes much clearer. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:23:35

you are evil.... and yet I cant look away. my F5 finger hasn't hurt this bad since mortal kombat  came out in the 90's
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:06:07
i have my exit point to minimize losses set. As long as it doesn't go below that point i am in it for the long haul. Even if it goes below that point,I could easily see myself buying back in depending on why the price fell and by how much. if the price stays static ~650 that  is great, I see stabilization as a great sign to build consumer confidence in the currency. The more stable it is the more the HODLers will start to spend it and the more mainstream it will become.  
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:50:58


I got it Thanks for the Contribution

Actually he did know. the future Satoshi was rich enough to buy a time machine to go back in time to tell the past satoshi how it would take off in the future and to hoard at least 1 million bitcoin to be able to buy said time machine in the future.

It was how I first experienced the real life use of bitcoin. I was hesitant to put my own money at risk but through someone's generous tip I was able to make several risk free Transactions to learn how it works. I am know a bitcoin believer thanks to tipping. lets call tipping the gateway drug the free sample that gets you hooked!
@_date: 2014-05-29 02:52:29

Is anyone here to collect the tips? can we take roll?
@_date: 2014-07-29 03:29:39
ive been using coinbase and currently have money in the vault no complaints here as of yet. however i realize that i am at risk of becoming the next person to be goxed or i guess coinbased in this instance. i to am too lazy to go through the extra precautions of setting up my own cold storage which in my opinion also carry a certain level of risk. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:00:37
yes see my new message

I haven't been following this case very closely at all because frankly speaking, I have no idea what he did or did not do and I don't care.  He may have helped Bitcoin get to where it is at, but who is to say his actions haven't impeded the ultimate success of Bitcoin. let the jury of his peers decide if the time fits the alleged crime.  
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:31:08

give it a try, but be fast lest someone steal it out from under you 
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:15:57

@_date: 2014-12-04 00:32:04
This is literally the most fun i have had on ever.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:59:51
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:34:54
and yet your mom has never complained after all these years
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:07:23
Look closely something ain't right and its missing the last letter could be a lower case or capital good luck 1800 bits
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:50:48
what the hell this. could be my opportunity to turn 1 ubit into 1 billion  
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:42:36
I sure hope so sold everything near the top and want to get back in!!
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:56:06
Hopefully to convice others to jump on the bandwagon and drive prices down so I can get back on and profit again.... DUH!
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:30:22
not yet.... I foresee further dropping
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:31:50
down down down.... just saying
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:33:24
nope just trying to get people to sell sell sell so I can buy low
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:17:36
the answer is yes to both questions
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:42:52
which one do you want more? a possible chance at riches or a possible chance at love with this girl? neither is a sure thing. and both could lead to heartache and loss. girls and bitcoin are like a lot of ups and downs
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:35:53
I am shorting and have made some relatively good cash in the past week. do I plan to go long again? Yes just not yet :) who are the fools: Those that held and lost 30% or those that sold and plan to get back on board once the volatility levels off? 
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:07:18
i am not sure i would stay with him if he took that amount of risk on one investment. i would make some sort of compromise as well

You anti-taxers are living in a dream world. Anti-taxers are like anti-vaxers. sounds good in theory.... detrimental in reality! Pay your fair share of taxes because in the end if you don't we all lose. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:22:15
I sold at about $960/coin no problems here.... Just saying.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:11:17
I never said I wasn't going to buy more i just am anticipating a large correction and want to jump back on for even larger gains. no need to hodl when you can profit :)
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:41:39
good luck with that. there is always a premium paid when purchasing bitcoins. you can always exchange goods for bitcoin that might work as you set the price for your goods
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:28:29
Sell Sell Sell. Drive that price down Bitches so that I can buy low 
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:21:42
This is easy to say today because bitcoin is at a near all time high wait a couple weeks/months when something happens to cause a meteoric fall back down to the $200 - $300 range. a 60% loss of value is a terrible thing if you have put all your eggs in the bitcoin basket. similar to the problem of hyperinflation.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:34:10
down down down... just saying. I hate it when i am right. hehehe
@_date: 2016-12-21 04:46:07
you don't get invited to many parties do you? buzzkill!!!
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:28:38
2 years ago I gifted bitcoin on reddits christmas gift exchange... not received well not at all.
@_date: 2016-12-21 04:52:20
I know, I know I was late to the party. Get in line and all that, but....Party rockin in da house tonight. $800 Bitches, whats up!! woot woot!!I've got that sexual feeling. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:28:45
Too good to be true??? Yes... Scam??? Yes
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:01:05

It's war time bitches grab your guns. time to default on our national debt and shoot anyone that has a problem with it. When in debt exert your dominance. America = Alpha Dog.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:06:30
Awesome I will have to play around with this
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:32:11
I am confused. $300 Dollars does not seem like a big deal to me just a few months ago it was around $600. I guess it just depends on when you got on the bandwagon.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:04:36
I will whore myself out and change my photo to this, with a skin colored speedo to up the anti, for .5 bitcoin. But, i am just  a bitcoin peasant willing to eat  the scraps off the floor.
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:08:14
because its bitcoin... give it a while it will "shoot" back down again... and then up and then down. this should not come as a surprise
